Agreement</HEAD>

   Newly reunited Berlin and Los Angeles
formally became sister-cities and their mayors pledged to promote
cultural, educational and social exchanges.
   The agreement signed Friday by Berlin Governing Mayor Walter
Momper and Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley extended an existing
sister-city arrangement to what was once East Berlin.
   Bradley and Momper signed the cooperation pact during a ceremony
in the City Hall Rotunda. For 23 years, Los Angeles and the area
formerly known as West Berlin maintained sister-city ties.
   Momper was beginning a two-day visit aimed at showing the
importance of the role the United States played in German
reunification, which became official Wednesday.
   Friday, Momper addressed the Los Angeles World Affairs Council
and the German-American Chamber of Commerce. He was scheduled to
attend German-American Day celebrations in Anaheim and in Los
Angeles today as well as a dinner-dance hosted by Bradley at the
Hyatt Hotel at Los Angeles International Airport.

<HEAD>Conventional Arms Treaty Will be Ready Next Month; Second Pact
Lags</HEAD>

   A treaty to reduce NATO and Warsaw Pact
non-nuclear forces in Europe will be ready for signing next month,
but a U.S.-Soviet pact to curb long-range nuclear weapons is
lagging even after top-level talks.
   The conventional arms treaty, the most sweeping arms control
pact in history, will be signed at a summit in Paris by the 16
North Atlantic Treaty Organization members and the six-nation
Warsaw Pact.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze settled all remaining questions about
arms-reduction zones, aircraft ceilings and helicopter restrictions
over six hours of talks Friday.
   ``This is a major accomplishment,'' Shevardnadze said.
   But the Soviet official said he and Baker were unable ``to reach
agreement on every and all issues'' in the path of a U.S.-Soviet
treaty to cut long-range nuclear missiles by about 30 percent.
   That casts doubt on a December summit in Moscow between
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, although
Baker said ``it's still very possible.''
   He said it depends on settling a dispute over transfers to
allies of nuclear arms and technology that would be banned under
the treaty.
   Baker said he made ``good progress'' with Shevardnadze on the
issue, known as non-circumvention, and that if U.S. and Soviet
negotiators in Geneva follow through the two other roadblocks might
be cleared.
   ``We are tired,'' Shevardnadze said, ``but the results are
good.''
   The two other unsettled issues concern the kinds of SS-18
missile tests the Soviets would be permitted to conduct and whether
the Soviet Backfire bomber would be subject to numerical
restrictions.
   Between their two sessions Friday, Baker and Shevardnadze took a
break to preside at a ceremony dedicating a new sculpture for the
United Nations that symbolizes the growing superpower rapport.
   The work of Soviet sculptor Zurab Tseretel, titled ``Good
Defeats Evil,'' incorporates pieces of intermediate-range nuclear
missiles that were dismantled in a 1988 U.S.-Soviet treaty.
   Baker flew home to Washington and Shevardnadze to Moscow.
   Their chief arms control aides, who participated in the talks
first at the Soviet and then the U.S. mission to the United Nations
now will try again in Geneva to reach solutions.
   And Shevardnadze will visit Washington next month to try to wrap
up the treaty with Baker.
   The Conventional Forces in Europe treaty on which Baker and
Shevardnadze did agree would be the largest arms-control deal in
history and the first in Europe since the end of World War II. It
would take a much bigger bite out of the Soviet arsenal in Europe
than the U.S. arsenal.
   NATO and the Warsaw Pact each would be limited to 20,000 tanks,
20,000 artillery pieces, 30,000 armored combat vehicles and 2,000
helicopters in the area stretching from Europe's Atlantic Coast to
the Ural Mountains inside the Soviet Union.

   Princess Diana had coffee in the White House
with Barbara Bush and visited a ``first lady'' of a different kind
during a whirlwind 24-hour tour of the nation's capital.
   The other ``first lady'' she saw Friday is a 3-year-old girl who
earned her nickname when she became the first child placed at
Grandma's House, a home for children with AIDS.
   The princess hugged the little girl and gave her a ride in her
Rolls-Royce. As cameras flashed, she stepped out of the car with
the little girl in her arms - a symbolic picture that gratified the
founders of Grandma's House.
   ``It shows that it's all right to love a person with AIDS, it's
all right to care about a person with AIDS, it's all right to hug a
person with AIDS ... It won't hurt you,'' said the Rev. Debbie
Tate, president of a crisis housing organization that runs
Grandma's House.

   SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) - Sylvester Stallone, of ``Rocky'' and
``Rambo'' movie fame, won a court order against a persistent fan
who he claimed has written letters threatening: ``I'll tie you up
if you try to escape from me!''
   Elfie Wade of Santa Monica was ordered Thursday to stay at least
200 yards away from the actor's Malibu home and his Santa
Monica-based White Eagle Enterprises.
   ``I am extremely concerned that Ms. Wade may be a great danger
and threat to me,'' Stallone said in a written court statement.
   Wade has dogged Stallone for nearly two years, placing up to 10
letters a day in his mailbox, according to court documents.
   The temporary order prohibits Wade from following, telephoning
or writing to the actor. A hearing on Stallone's request for a
permanent injunction was scheduled for Oct. 18.
   Other stars who have taken court action against obsessive fans
include Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Michael J. Fox and Sharon
Gless, whose home was invaded by a fan.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Ivana Trump will write two novels for Simon &amp;
Schuster with the help of an unnamed writer described as an
``experienced commercial novelist,'' the publisher said.
   The name of Mrs. Trump's co-author and terms of the deal were
not disclosed in a statement released by Pocket Books, the Simon &amp;
Schuster division that plans to publish the first book in 1992.
   Her estranged husband, developer Donald Trump, recently
published his second best seller, ``Surviving at the Top.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - First lady Barbara Bush will appear as
herself on a the ABC daytime soap opera ``All My Children,'' using
the opportunity to promote life-saving volunteerism.
   Mrs. Bush, scheduled to appear on the show's Oct. 18 episode,
will deliver a public service announcement for the National Bone
Marrow Registry as part of the drama's story line, ABC said.
   The first lady's brief spot complements plot developments
surrounding a child character stricken by leukemia whose survival
depends on receiving a bone marrow transplant.

   ROXIE, Miss. (AP) - The mayor of this tiny town is a little
embarrassed that makers of Elton John's latest music video chose it
as a location site because its streets are chock-full of potholes.
   The Mississippi Film Office sent producer David Zuckerman
pictures of several small towns in the southwestern part of the
state, and Roxie ``beat'' the others because of its many
bone-jarring pavement craters.
   ``It was kind of sad that they were here hunting the one thing
we were trying to get rid of,'' said Betty Norris, mayor of the
town of 600.
   Elton John, known for songs such as ``Rocket Man'' and ``Goodbye
Yellow Brick Road,'' did not come to Roxie, but about 25 film crew
members and actors came to shoot footage Sunday for the video for
``You Gotta Love Someone.''
   Norris said the town didn't earn any money from the filming, but
she hopes it will bring attention to the city's application for a
street repair grant.

   MEDINA, Ohio (AP) - Cartoonist Tom Batiuk is depending on the
band director in his comic strip ``Funky Winkerbean'' to inspire
readers to deluge ABC Sports with mail in support of more air time
for football halftime shows.
   In a cartoon published today, Harry L. Dinkle, the ``world's
greatest band director'' in the daily comic strip, urges readers to
clip and mail to ABC a coupon saying: ``Halftime belongs to the
bands!''
   Batiuk, who draws the strip at his home in this northeast Ohio
community about 25 miles southwest of Cleveland, said Friday he
wants ABC to know that ``Project Halftime'' is done in fun.
   Batiuk, who played in the band when he was in junior high
school, said he picked ABC as a target because it has broadcast
college football games longer than any other network.
   Mark Mandel, a spokesman for ABC Sports in New York, said Friday
the network tries to include aands in at least part of its halftime
show.

<HEAD>State Budget Woes Spread Outward from Northeast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State budget crunches are spreading south and
west from New England where they began, the National Governors'
Association reports.
   ``The fiscal condition of the states is the worst we have seen
since the major recession of 1983,'' NGA executive director Raymond
C. Scheppach said Friday in releasing the group's annual fiscal
survey of the states.
   The study attributed the difficulties to a slowing national
economy, increased Medicaid costs and the continuing decline in
federal aid to states.
   Over half of the states would have ended their most recent
fiscal year with deficits had they not moved to cut spending after
their budgets were enacted, Scheppach said.
   States raised taxes by an expected 10.3 billion, the largest
dollar increase ever, the report said. Twenty-six states increased
net revenues and seven reduced them. Nearly half the total increase
came in three states - Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York.
   State spending was up 7.7 percent on average in fiscal 1990, but
it is expected to grow only by an average of 6.5 percent this year,
Scheppach said.
   Total state year-end balances declined from $12.5 billion in
fiscal 1989 to $9.1 billion in 1990, and are estimated to decline
to $7.4 billion in fiscal 1991.
   Those balances - which amount to surplus money after all
spending - averaged 4.8 percent in 1989 and are estimated to be
down to 3.5 percent at the end of fiscal 1991. State budget
officers consider a 5 percent reserve prudent as a hedge against
tough times.
   A regional economic slowdown that hit New England has caused
massive financial problems for all six New England states,
prompting the region's three Democratic governors to retire and
leaving two of three Republican governors in dire political
condition. In addition, New York and New Jersey have run into
financial trouble, prompting big tax increases.
   ``What seems to be happening is the turndown in the economy that
began in New England ... is now spreading South and West,''
Scheppach said.
   Adding to state financial problems is the growth in demands for
Medicaid spending, the report said. Scheppach pointed to figures
showing states increased Medicaid spending by 18.4 percent in 1990,
and are estimated to increase them 15 percent to 20 percent in
fiscal 1991.

<HEAD>U.S. Upholds Nominee's Criticism of Burma</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Frederick Vreeland's criticism of Burmese
policies that cost him his nomination as ambassador to Rangoon
simply upheld the position of the U.S. government, the State
Department says.
   A human rights organization, meanwhile, urged the United States
to continue criticizing the Burmese military regime, and to contest
its right to Burma's seat at the United Nations.
   Burma's ruling State Law and Order Council canceled its earlier
acceptance of Vreeland as ambassador in objecting to his answers to
questions by senators at his confirmation hearing earlier this
week.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Friday that the
Burmese government informed the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon on Thursday
of its decision to withdraw acceptance of Vreeland. The White House
then withdrew Vreeland's nomination under the rule that a host
country must agree to receive an ambassador.
   ``Mr. Vreeland's statements reflected the policy and the views
of the United States government, including our often-stated view
that the military regime should rapidly implement the results of
the national elections in May, which should lead to a return to
parliamentary democracy,'' Boucher said.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said Thursday that he believed the
nomination was withdrawn because of questions raised about
Vreeland's involvement in what DAmato said was a cover up of
possible Bulgarian and Soviet involvement in the 1981 assassination
attempt against Pope John Paul II.
   D'Amato said he had intended to question Vreeland at a second
hearing about his activities in Rome.
   Asked if the withdrawal had anything to do with accusations that
Vreeland was a CIA agent involved in suppressing the papal
investigation, Boucher repeated that the action was taken as a
result of the Burmese objections.
   The State Department spokesman declined to answer questions
related to reports of Vreeland's CIA involvement, saying it was
department policy not to respond to allegations of intelligence
connections or activity.
   ``He had a career as political and economic officer, various
positions at our embassies overseas,'' Boucher said of Vreeland.
   Asia Watch, a private human rights monitoring group, later urged
the Bush administration to maintain a tough stand against rights
abuses in Burma.
   In making a new ambassadorial nomination, it should put Burma on
notice ``that the United States regards improvement in the human
rights situation as its highest priority,'' Asia Watch Executive
Director Sidney Jones said in a statement.
   Ms. Jones also urged the administration to object to seating the
Burmese delegation when the Credentials Committee report is
presented next week at United Nations headquarters.

   A housewife constantly racing to keep up
with her active 4-year-old son has found a high-tech way to get him
home in a hurry - she beeps him.
   ``When Jonathan's beeper goes off, he is home, which is nice. He
can't argue; he can't say, `Just a minute,' '' said Pat Hammett.
``It's convenient in that I don't have to stand out and yell for
five minutes and be one of those screaming mothers.''
   The beepers designed for children are the creation of Leslie and
John Gilmore, who founded Kid Konnection in this Denver suburb
about a month ago.
   The pagers come in brightly colored cases that can be worn on a
child's waist. They can be leased for $14 to $18 a month, which
pays for the beeper and the paging service, Mrs. Gilmore said.
   So far, the fledgling company has received more than 200
inquiries and its clients include a Boulder teen-ager and a
hearing-impaired child whose beeper vibrates.
   ``I think it gives children a sense of responsibility rather
than having Mom come out, screaming at them,'' Mrs. Gilmore said.
   The couple came up with the idea after Mrs. Gilmore quit her job
as manager of a local boutique to stay home with her sons,
Christopher, 4, and Jeffrey, 18 months.
   Like her neighbor Mrs. Hammett, Mrs. Gilmore had trouble keeping
up with her 4-year-old.
   ``I thought there ought to be a way to communicate with him when
I'm in the house and he's out,'' she said.
   Christopher said he's happy with the arrangement.
   ``It protects me,'' he said. ``When it beeps, I come in.''
   Mrs. Gilmore said: ``It just has become so routine for him, like
brushing his teeth.''
   Although the kiddie beeper is a novelty with a purpose, some
wonder whether it will cause a high-tech communication gap.
   Mitch Handelsman, an associate professor of psychology at the
University of Colorado-Denver, says the potential problem doesn't
have to surface.
   ``Just as TV can be useful if there is sufficient communication,
this beeper technology can become a part of optimal family
functioning as long as it does not substitute for important
communication,'' he said.
   The beepers also aren't foolproof.
   Some children ``will find 100 creative ways to lose the
beeper,'' Handelsman said.
   Mrs. Hammett said that although her son does not leave the house
to play without his beeper, the device has not made her complacent.
   ``I consider myself an overly protective parent,'' she said. ``I
still poke my head out the door.''

<HEAD>Pound to Join European Currency System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a surprise turnaround, Britain has declared it
is ready to tie the pound to Europe's exchange rate mechanism.
   The decision is apt to bolster both European efforts to
integrate the continent's economies and British attempts to harness
domestic inflation. However, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
stressed her continued opposition to creating a single European
bank and a single currency.
   The announcement Friday by Chancellor of the Exchequer John
Major was coupled with word that Britain's base interest rate will
drop by one percentage point to 14 percent on Monday.
   The pound is joining the European exchange rate mechanism at a
high level, which the government hopes will ease Britain's 10.6
percent inflation rate. The country's switch from a free-floating
currency to a linked one is designed to promote economic stability
by limiting disruptive exchange rate movements.
   The pound and stock market rose sharply on the news because
joining the mechanism would set a stable floor under the currency.
   The sterling joins nine other European Community currencies in
Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism: the Spanish peseta, the German
mark, the French franc, the Dutch guilder, the Italian lira, the
Belgian and Luxembourg francs, the Danish krone and the Irish
pound.
   The Portuguese escudo and the Greek drachma are the only
remaining outsiders.
   Thatcher agreed in principle to link the pound to the other
currencies at a community summit meeting in Madrid last year, but
she said she would move only when Britain's inflation rate was
lower to the European average of 5.5 percent.
   Britain decided to go ahead because Britain's double-digit
inflation is expected to decline, Mrs. Thatcher said.
   The twin moves of entry into the 11-year-old mechanism and the
one-point interest rate cut are ``right for the times,'' the prime
minister said, speaking outside 10 Downing Street, her residence.
   ``The fact that our policies are working and are seen to be
working have made both these decisions possible,'' she said.
   Entering the exchange rate mechanism would ``underpin our
anti-inflationary stance,'' she said.
   Opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock said it was correct
to cut interest rates and join the mechanism but that the moves
were ``action of cornered government.''
   Britain previously linked the pound to other currencies from
1944 to 1971 under a system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates.
It then participated in a rate movement-limiting European ``snake''
until 1973.
   The pound, which has risen sharply in recent months on
speculation that it would soon join the exchange rate mechanism,
soared to $1.9455 from $1.9185 before the announcement, and to
2.9933 marks from 2.9492 marks.
   London's Stock Exchange extended trading for an hour because of
the announcement. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index closed Friday at 2,143.9, up 73.5 points, or 3.6 percent,
from Thursday's close.

   Arts patrons hailed a Cincinnati jury's acquittal of a museum
and its director for exhibiting sexually graphic Robert
Mapplethorpe photos, but critics of the photos said the battle is
not over.
   A Municipal Court jury on Friday acquitted Cincinnati's
Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis Barrie, of
pandering obscenity and using children in nudity-related material.
Barrie could have been sentenced to one year in jail and fined
$2,000, and the gallery fined $10,000, if convicted of both
misdemeanors.
   ``I am truly astounded,'' said David Ross, director of the
Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, where the traveling
Mapplethorpe exhibit closed Friday. ``I had expected the jury to
convict. I am more proud to be an American today.''
   Floyd Abrams, a New York City lawyer who specializes in First
Amendment cases, said similar cases may arise, however. ``Another
prosecutor could think, `I'll do it differently. I'll do it better.
Put me in front of the jury.'''
   He also cautioned that the Cincinnati trial alone could
discourage controversial museum exhibitions.
   ``Freedom of expression is worse off today than it was the day
before the indictment, but better off than it was yesterday,'' he
said.
   In Tupelo, Miss., the Rev. Donald Wildmon, who heads the
conservative American Family Association, said the acquittal does
nothing to end the fight to prevent the National Endowment for the
Arts from using tax dollars to finance artwork his group considers
pornographic and religiously offensive.
   Endowment officials said NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer would
not have any comment on the verdict.
   ``This is not a landmark, Pearl Harbor decision,'' Wildmon said.
``This was just another obscenity trial.'' He said another court in
another city could have ruled differently.
   But Elliot Mincberg, legal director of the liberal People for
the American Way Action Fund in Washington, D.C., called the
verdict a ``clear-cut victory for free expression and the First
Amendment.''
   ``Today's verdict is a repudiation of the far right's campaign
to vilify artistic expression in America,'' Mincberg said.
   Joy Silverman, ssociate director of the National Campaign for
Freedom of Expression, a nonprofit group representing artists,
applauded ``the courage of the jurors in Cincinnati.''
   ``They have not caved in to the censorship hysteria initiated by
members of the far right,'' said Ms. Silverman.
   Conservative lawmakers and religious fundamentalists have led
the fight against the NEA's partial financing of the touring
exhibition of photos by the late Mapplethorpe, several of which are
sexually graphic.
   Ralph Reed, a spokesman for the Rev. Pat Robertson's Christian
Coalition, said: ``We are disappointed in the outcome but this is a
long struggle and we recognize that we cannot win every case.
   ``The 2 Live Crew verdict in Florida earlier this week more than
counterbalances this unfortunate verdict.''
   A record store owner was convicted of obscenity Wednesday in
Fort Lauderdale for selling a sexually explicit album by the rap
group.
   Debbie Bennett, public relations director for 2 Live Crew's
label, Luke Records, said the Cincinnati jury's decision encouraged
her on the eve of the rap group's own obscenity trial next week.
   ``I guess America is looking up,'' she said.

   University of the District of Columbia
students ended a protest that immobilized the school for 11 days,
but they failed to win their chief demand - ouster of the most of
the school's trustees.
   After all-day discussions Friday, students accepted a agreement
in which trustees agreed to lobby the City Council to restructure
the board and expand it from 15 to 21 members.
   School officials also granted nearly all of about 40 other
student demands for improvements in academic and athletic programs.
   ``This is a new day at UDC,'' protest leader Mark Thompson told
a crowd of cheering students late Friday night. ``Never again will
a UDC student be referred to in a negative light. We have proven
that we are concerned about our situation here.''
   ``We have reached an agreement that will serve the university
well,'' Trustee A. Knighton Stanley said. ``Never again will
students at UDC be implied to be inferior to any students in the
United States of America.''
   Several dozen protestors at the 12,000-student public
institution seized control of a university building Sept. 26,
demanding that the 11 mayoral appointees to the board resigned.
   The students claimed the board was controlled by political
friends of Mayor Marion Barry who allowed the school's quality to
deteriorate. They also said the school's accreditation was in
jeopardy.
   Students voted to approve the agreement only minutes before an
11 p.m. deadline set by trustees, who said they would withdraw the
offer and end negotiations at that time.
   Thompson said students would remain in the building until a
signing ceremony, set for 12:30 p.m. Sunday.
   Talks had stalled for several days over the issue of the
resignations, with most board members refusing to quit. Board
Chairwoman Nira Long resigned effective Oct. 16, however.
   Stanley said two board members who agreed to resign did so for
personal reasons that had nothing to do with the protest. Stanley
offered his own resignation to speed along dialogue.
   A source close to the negotiations said trustees regarded the
students' request for resignations as ``foolish.''
   Such a move would have put the school in a legal limbo, opened
the trustees to charges they had abandoned their fiduciary
responsibilities and jeopardized the school's accreditation, said
the source, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   Trustees decided to end negotiations Friday night if no
agreement had been reached because they feared students leaders had
lost control of the protest, the source said.

   American bishops at a Vatican meeting said
the Roman Catholic Church should keep the rule of priestly
celibacy, despite criticism that it is driving some potential
candidates from the ministry.
   ``If the church is singing the same tune as everybody else, who
needs the church?'' Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati,
head of the U.S. bishops' conference, told reporters Friday.
``That's why I am persuaded that celibacy is much more important
than it has ever been before.''
   He and other prelates at the international synod said the church
and celibacy represent a ``countercultural force'' showing there is
more to life than the pursuit of personal satisfaction.
   The issue of celibacy has been raised numerous times during the
first week of the monthlong synod, an advisory body convened by
Pope John Paul II to discuss the formation of priests. More than
200 bishops are attending.
   The pope has indicated he will not change the celibacy rule, and
the Vatican moderator at the synod has said the issue should not
even be discussed. Still, some bishops have questioned the
requirement and suggested that allowing ordination of married men
could help alleviate the shortage of priests in some areas.
   The number of priests in the world has dropped from 406,000 to
400,000 the past five years. In the United States, the number of
students in the last four years of seminary was 3,698 this year,
compared with 7,855 in 1968.
   The celibacy rule is based on the view that sex and marriage
would prevent the priest from giving his complete attention to the
work of God.
   In his comments, Pilarczyk dismissed the idea that the number of
priests should be used as a yardstick of the strength of the
church.
   ``It's not necessarily the case that the more priests you've
got, the better off the church is,'' Pilarczyk said.
   Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago said steps must be taken to
halt ``the erosion'' in the understanding and appreciation of
celibacy.
   ``There are many positive values to celibacy,'' he said. ``I
think the people who can best (espouse those values) are the
priests themselves. You hear some priests complaining, but there
are many, many wonderful priests, the vast majority, who live a
chaste, celibate life and get a great deal from their ministry.''
   The American church was shaken this summer when Archbishop
Eugene A. Marino of Atlanta resigned following revelations of a
two-year ``intimate relationship'' with a young woman.
   However, Bernardin said the percentage of Amercan priests who
have been involved in sexual scandals ``is really very small.''
   ``We don't want to downplay or minimize the seriousness of those
problems that do exist,'' he said. ``We are trying to handle them
as best we can.''
   A Canadian prelate, Auxiliary Bishop Frederick Bernard Henry of
London, Ontario, told the synod Wednesday that the church needs
programs of psychosexual testing to monitor the sexual maturity of
priests.
   He noted that recent cases of sexual abuse by priests had caused
``deep soul-searching'' in the Canadian church.
   In July, a church-appointed commission reported priests had
sexually abused boys in Newfoundland for more than a decade and the
church had failed to stop the practice.

   Sexually graphic photos by Robert Mapplethorpe
have artistic value, a jury ruled in acquitting an art gallery and
its director of obscenity charges in a closely watched trial.
   A Hamilton County Municipal Court jury Friday cleared
Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis
Barrie, of one count each of pandering obscenity and using children
in nudity-related photos in the exhibit, ``Robert Mapplethorpe: The
Perfect Moment.''
   Barrie said he was grateful at the outcome in the nation's first
obscenity trial of an art gallery, but lamented that battles over
artistic freedom were still being waged.
   ``I'm glad this fight is over in Cincinnati, but it's not over
in the rest of our country,'' he said. ``I will be in a number of
cities speaking about this issue.''
   Next week in Florida, members of the rap group 2 Live Crew face
trial on obscenity charges for performing songs from their sexually
explicit ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' album, which a federal judge
had ruled obscene. Earlier this week, a Florida jury found a
record-store owner guilty of obscenity for selling the album.
   Barrie smiled slightly as the first of the four innocent
verdicts was announced, and his smile widened as a court clerk read
each subsequent verdict. Gallery supporters shouted and applauded.
   The four-man, four-woman jury, composed mostly of working-class
suburbanites, reached its verdict after five days of testimony and
two hours of deliberations.
   If Barrie had been convicted of both misdemeanor charges, he
could have been sentenced to one year in jail and fined $2,000. The
gallery could have been fined $10,000 if convicted on both counts.
   ``This was a major battle fought here today, not some minor
incident in the city of Cincinnati,'' Barrie said. ``It was a major
battle for the arts and for creativity and for the continuance of
creativity in this country ... ''
   The Rev. Donald E. Wildmon, whose American Family Association in
Tupelo, Miss., has fought National Endowment for the Arts funding
for exhibits such as Mapplethorpe's, said the trial was not that
significant.
   ``This is not a landmark, Pearl Harbor decision. This was just
another obscenity trial,'' Wildmon said. ``I think this really puts
the NEA issue right back in the political arena where it belongs.''
   Barrie, 43, testified during the trial that he and the gallery's
board had never wavered in their decision to bring the
controversial exhibit to Cincinnati.
   ``Robert Mapplethorpe was a great artist, it was a beautiful
show, it should have never been here in court,'' he said.
   Mapplethorpe died of AIDS at age 42 in March 1989.
   The Cincinnati charges were based on seven photographs a grand
jury cited from the 175-photo exhibit. Five of the photos have
homosexual or sadomasochistic subjects; two show children with
their genitals exposed.
   The exhibit attracted little attention in its first showings in
Philadelphia and Chicago, but in Washington it angered Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., and other congressional conservatives.
   Their attack forced the Corcoran Gallery of Art to cancel the
show in mid-1989. It also prompted the new director of the National
Endowment for the Arts, John Frohnmayer, to require that artists
sign a statement agreeing to not use NEA funds to make obscene art.
Some have turned down grants in protest.
   The exhibit drew more than 80,000 people during its seven-week
run in Cincinnati, an attendance record for an art exhibit in the
city. The traveling show closed this week in Boston, where 103,000
tickets were sold.
   During closing arguments, Assistant City Prosecutor Frank Prouty
told jury members it was up to them to decide the artistic merit of
the photographs.
   ``Are these van Goghs, these five pictures?,'' he asked as he
went into graphic descriptions of the photos of the adults.
   H. Louis Sirkin, Barrie's attorney, said the photos undoubtedly
offended some people but had serious artistic merit.
   He also reminded jurors that the same exhibit was shown in other
cities without incident.
   ``Is Cincinnati that different? Are we that childish?'' Sirkin
asked. ``Are we not big enough to say we can't accept what other
cities have seen?''

<HEAD>Preliminary Probe Clears NIH Researcher, Investigation to Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A preliminary investigation has discredited
allegations that a National Institutes of Health researcher falsely
claimed to have discovered the virus that causes AIDS, the head of
the NIH said.
   Dr. William F. Raub, acting director of the Bethesda, Md.-based
institutes, said Friday, however, that he had ordered a full-blown
investigation despite the fact that the initial inquiry had
``resolved certain of the publicized allegations and issues or
shown them to be without substance'' in the case of Dr. Robert C.
Gallo.
   Raub said Gallo and Gallo's research team in the Laboratory of
Tumor Cell Biology found the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV,
on their own.
   Gallo's group ``had a substantial number of HIV detections and
isolations from several different sources at the critical time''
that Gallo's lab was growing both the virus it isolated and a virus
it had been given by a French team.
   Independent discovery of the virus has been credited to both
Gallo's team and the Pasteur Institute team led by Dr. Luc
Montagnier. Montagnier's team published its results first, and the
French and United States governments agreed to settle a lawsuit
over priority, with researchers from both teams sharing royalties
from the blood test.
   In an article published last November, the Chicago Tribune
raised questions about whether Gallo's team found the virus on its
own or found, inadvertently or otherwise, what it had been given by
the French team.
   NIH said its preliminary investigation determined that Gallo's
team found the virus independently.
   Raub said the formal investigation will try to determine the
origins of the virus that Gallo and his colleagues used to develop
the blood tests.
   ``Subjects of the investigation are Dr. Gallo and Dr. Mikulas
Popovic,'' Raub said.
   He said the investigation would focus on ``several aspects of
published reports'' by Gallo's team, particularly the May 4, 1984
article by Gallo, Popovic and others in the magazine Science that
announced discovery of the virus.
   An NIH spokesman said the other authors are not being
investigated.
   Raub said investigators would test ``a number of biological
samples in an effort to determine the origins'' of the virus used
to develop the blood test used today to detect HIV.
   Raub did not say what ``several aspects'' he had in mind, and
the spokesman, Don Ralbovsky, said ``we really can't go into other
detail.''
   The investigation will be conducted by the Office of Scientific
Integrity, an arm of NIH, with consultants nominated by the
National Academy of Sciences and its affiliate, the Institute of
Medicine.
   There was no answer at Gallo's home Friday night.

<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas claim to have
captured a provincial Afghan capital after several days of heavy
battles.
   The rebel report came during escalated fighting in Afghanistan's
10-year-old civil war.
   A spokesman for the Moslem insurgents based in Pakistan, Hamid
Karzai, said the guerrilla forces on Friday overran Terin Kot,
about 180 miles south of Kabul, the Afghan capital. He said the
victory followed several days of heavy battles.
   Some Islamic green flags of the insurgents flew from buildings
in the city, the capital of Uruzgan province. However, it was not
possible to confirm the rebels' claim that they controlled it.
   The assault on government troops defending Terin Kot was
launched by guerrillas of several rebel groups with headquarters in
Pakistan.
   For more than a dozen years, U.S.-backed rebels have been
fighting to topple Kabul's government.
   Moslem insurgents reportedly control much of the countryside,
but they have been ineffective in destroying government defenses
around most cities and control only a handful of the towns.
   Moscow has been the major backer of the government in Kabul.
However, the Soviets withdrew the last of their soldiers from
Afghanistan in February 1989.
   Since then, President Najibullah has tried to distance himself
and his party from its communist roots, claiming to have rekindled
the spirit of Islam.
   Rebel leaders have dismissed that effort and vowed to press on
with their efforts to overthrow his government. Bitter feuding
among rebel leaders has stymied the resistance, however.
   For several months, Moscow and Washington have been trying to
work out a settlement to end the war.
   They are reportedly close to an agreement that calls for new
national elections. The stumbling block has been the composition of
a caretaker administration to oversee the vote.
   After a lull of several months, renewed fighting and rocket
attacks have been reported throughout the country. Earlier this
week, 61 people died and scores were injured in rocket attacks on
the Afghan capital.

<HEAD>Burial Insurance Is a Big Hit on LA's Gang-Plagued Streets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parents of young gang members and other
children exposed to street violence are snapping up low-cost life
insurance policies designed to soften the blow of burial and
funeral services.
   One insurance salesman said door-to-door sales calls in some of
the city's most gang-plagued areas were paying off, especially when
they were made shortly after shootings in the neighborhood.
   ``We are doing fantastic business,'' said Magdy Barsoum, an
Inglewood district manager for American National Insurance Co.
   Insurance industry officials challenged the ethics of such sales
calls, but Barsoum defended the practice, saying otherwise many
would not be able to obtain needed coverage.
   Parents ``are finding out that a lot of young kids are dying
from gangs, shootings and accidents. We pay out $70,000 to $80,000
a month on violent deaths,'' Barsoum said,
   The $10-a-month policies typically provide $5,000 to $10,000 in
coverage. Many are bought simply to cushion funeral and burial
costs that average $4,000, he said.
   Barsoum said his 30 sales agents scan newspapers for reports of
drive-by shootings and other gang violence, then move quickly -
articles in hand - to the afflicted neighborhoods.
   Such crime stories are ``one of our best sources for
customers,'' Barsoum said. ``We take the newspaper out with us and
say, `Look here, your kids are in danger.' ''
   American National officials at company headquarters in
Galveston, Texas, do not approve.
   ``If there is any truth to that type of marketing it will be
discontinued,'' company spokesman Dan Wood said. ``That's certainly
not the way we do business, never has been.''
   ``This is not the kind of practice we would support or what our
code of ethics outlines as an appropriate practice,'' said Betty
Combs, spokeswoman for the California Association of Life
Underwriters.
   ``It is inappropriate to play on people's fears,'' she said.
``Life insurance is a product to be sold to families in need, not
on what their fears are.''
   Others say the technique provides coverage to residents in poor
neighborhoods who otherwise could not afford premiums set by
territorial rating, which often produces high rates in low-income
areas.
   ``I have never heard of an insurance company actively seeking
out a market like this,'' said Gene Grabowski, spokesman for the
American Council of Life Insurance in Washington. ``But it sounds
like they are being smart by providing a need.''
   Barsoum has some satisfied customers. Darryl Redford, 21, said
he purchased a $10,000 policy in July after a rash of drive-by
shootings.
   ``I've seen too many people get shot,'' Redford said. ``Heaven
prevent me from getting caught in a cross-fire, but this insurance
will bury me if I do.''

<HEAD>Air Force Contract to Northrop Criticized by House Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Air Force decision to award two new
contracts to a division of the Northrop Corp. that is under
suspension is being criticized by the chairman of a House panel.
   ``Combine this with the Navy's disclosure at our last hearing
that it had granted a waiver to purchase 104 gyroscopes for the
Harrier jet, and it appears that the suspension is not even a slap
on the wrist,'' said Rep. John Conyers. The Michigan Democrat
chairs the House Government Operations Committee and its
subcommittee on legislation and national security.
   Northrop Corp.'s Precision Products Division was suspended from
doing business with the Pentagon about 15 months ago. The company
earlier had been indicted for allegedly falsifying test results on
the Harrier jet fighter-bomber and air-launched cruise missile.
   On Sept. 19, the Air Force the suspension to purchase
replacement parts for gyroscopes on the Minuteman missile and those
used in the Paved Penny Laser Target Identification System on the
A-10 and A-7 aircraft.
   The Air Force said in a statement that it had granted the waiver
``to insure Paved Penny equipped A-10s deployed for Desert Shield
have sufficient spares to support night-time operations with
precision-guided munitions.''
   Operation Desert Shield is the Defense Department's code name
for the deployment of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf.
   The Air Force said it waived the suspension for the Minuteman
parts because they had become ``critically short due to utilization
rates and manufacturing lead times.''
   Such a shortage would ``adversely affect the high-alert status
required for this important part of our security deterrence,'' said
Maj. Phyllis Phipps-Barnes.
   Conyers previously held a hearing on the AV-8B Harrier jet, four
of which the Marine Corps grounded because of faulty sensors that
stabilize the aircraft.
   At the session, Col. James Hart, the Marine Corps officer for
the program, said it had waived the suspension against Northrop to
buy a package of spare rate sensor assemblies for $300,000 for the
Harrier.
   In the statement criticizing the Air Force, Conyers leveled a
new attack against the Harrier, which costs $20 million per
aircraft. Over the past six years, six servicemen have been killed
in accidents involving the aircraft.
   The most recent incident occurred Tuesday, when a Marine jet
pilot was killed during a training mission in North Carolina.
   ``It defies my imagination that the Navy finds acceptable these
losses and continues to operate a system with such a high fatality
rate and proven record of severe reliability problems,'' Conyers
said.
   The Marine Corps has nearly 200 Harriers, made by
McDonnell-Douglas Corp. under license from a British manufacturer.
   The Harriers, needing no runway to take off, can be based in
forest clearings and other unorthodox places to provide close
support and air cover for Marine units.

   The government was forced to shut down
temporarily three times in the past decade due to squabbles between
the administration and Congress over the budget.
   -The government closed briefly in November 1981 when an
estimated 400,000 employees were dismissed at midday after
President Reagan vetoed an emergency money bill.
   -On October 4, 1984, about 500,000 government workers were sent
home by Congress' failure to approve an appropriations bill.
   But they were told to be back at their desks the next day after
the Senate late in the day adopted an emergency spending measure.
   -On October 16, 1986, the government sent 500,000 non-essential
employees home at midday, but Congress later in the day passed an
appropriations bill acceptable to Reagan and workers were ordered
to report on their next shift.
   More than 1{ million employees, including more than a million
who work for the Defense Department, stayed on the job. Those who
got the half-day furlough included the president's maids and
gardeners.
   Only one out of four employees was considered non-essential.
   Congress, as it had done in 1981 and 1984, passed a resolution
ordering that employees furloughed get their regular salaries
anyway. Payments to furloughed workers cost the government an
estimated $85 million in 1981 and $65 million in 1984.

<HEAD>Union Leaders Blast Mayor They Helped Elect Over Layoff Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A defensive Mayor David Dinkins apologized
publicly to municipal union leaders, saying they were ``justifiably
annoyed'' about his abrupt proposal to lay off up to 15,000 city
workers.
   ``The unions should have been advised'' beforehand, the mayor
said Friday. ``We were going to do it, but it happened in a time
frame that did not make it possible. That's no excuse.''
   Dinkins said Thursday that he may be forced to send out pink
slips to deal with an expected budget deficit in fiscal 1992 of
$1.4 billion. The move puts New York among other Northeastern
cities that are letting workers go because of a sluggish economy
bordering on recession.
   The city's proposed layoffs and other agency reductions would
save the city $800 million. The mayor also ordered an immediate
freeze on hiring and merit raises in order to save another $115
million in payroll costs.
   The announcement drew criticism from the unions that put Dinkins
over the top last November and made him the first black mayor of
New York. The outcry came because Dinkins had not consulted his
allies first.
   ``The mayor has declared war on the unions in the city. He has
spit in the eye of public employees through this unilateral
action,'' said Barry Feinstein, president of Teamsters Local 237,
which has about 12,000 city workers.
   ``I feel betrayed, I swear, I really do,'' Stanley Hill,
executive director of District Council 37, which represents 140,000
city workers, said Friday.
   ``We have a tremendous problem. Those 15,000 workers are going
to come from the guts of us.''
   The mayor also has proposed new taxes to close a $1.8 billion
budget gap for this fiscal year. This week, New York went on a
fiscal roller coaster ride.
   On Monday, it settled its first union contract with a 5.5
percent raise for teachers. Union leaders, including Feinstein and
Hill, said then that they expected the city to be as generous with
them.
   On Tuesday, the mayor proposed a $1.8 billion plan to fight
crime in the city, including the hiring of nearly 8,000 police
officers and a severe increase in taxes.
   Hill said the hurt lingered despite an apology he said the mayor
offered overnight.
   ``We helped elect him. He only won by 2 percentage points. He
knows we played a vital role in making sure he won,'' Hill said.
``We didn't have to fight this hard to elect a mayor who would lay
off 15,000 workers.''
   The city faced an even worse budget crunch in 1975 when it
nearly went bankrupt and laid off about 25,000 workers. This time,
New York joins New Haven, Boston, Philadelphia, Trenton, N.J., and
Baltimore in using layoffs to balance the budget.

<TEXT>
   President Bush vetoed a bill that would mean
strict quotas on imports of textiles and shoes.
   Bush, in vetoing the bill Friday, said the measure ``picks the
pockets of U.S. consumers'' by driving up prices to the tune of
$2,600 per family over four years.
   He said also the bill would cause an ``economic calamity'' by
forcing a collapse of international trade talks.
   Congress had ignored Bush's veto threats in adopting the
legislation, which imposes quotas on imports of textiles, textile
products and non-rubber shoes.
   International trade agreements regulate trade in textiles and
impose other quotas.
   ``This highly protectionist bill would damage the national
economy, increase already artificially high costs to consumers of
several basic goods and abrogate our international agreements,''
Bush's veto message said.
   Disputing claims by the bill's supporters, Bush said the textile
industry was doing well. Domestic production has been up slightly
since 1987, he said, and unemployment in major textile-producing
states is lower than the national average.

<HEAD>Bush Proposes Legislation To Give Trade Benefits To Andes Nations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush has proposed giving a decade of
preferable trade benefits to four South American nations in
response to their cooperation in the war on drugs.
   Bush's Andean Trade Preference Act, proposed Friday, is
patterned after the Caribbean Basin Initiative that gives special
trade benefits to Caribbean nations.
   The beneficiary countries would be Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and
Bolivia.
   Also addressed in the Andean proposal Bush sent to Congress is
the long festering trade dispute with Colombia over cut flowers,
which would be made duty free.
   The measure would authorize duty free treatment for 10 years for
some imports from the countries along the Andean mountains, which
also are the principle source and production countries for the
cocaine trade.
   Products ``particularly sensitive to import competition'' will
not be duty free, the White House said. Those products include,
textiles and apparel, canned tuna, petroleum products, watches and
watch parts. Luggage, leather apparel and flat goods would be
eligible for a duty reduction program.
   The administration is trying to provide economic incentives and
assistance to South American countries that have suffered in
cracking down on lucrative drug industries that greatly buttress
their poor economies.

   A riot-torn neighborhood in western Japan
was littered with broken glass, burned-out cars and twisted
bicycles but was quiet today after another night of violence by
laborers.
   A police official blamed leftist day workers angry about a
police bribery scandal for touching off the four days of riots.
   At least 159 people, including 125 police, have been injured in
the violence in the Nishinari district of Osaka, the nation's
second-largest city, prefectural police officials said.
   More than 1,000 people pounded riot troopers with gasoline bombs
and rocks from Friday night until well into the early morning
hours, and almost 50 people had been arrested, a prefectural police
official said.
   At least 12 vehicles parked along the streets were burned
overnight, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Most of the protesters had dispersed by early this morning, but
a cordon of armored troopers continued to guard the police station.
   Elementary schools closed Friday due to the riots, but reopened
today.
   Osaka prefectural police, however, said the current calm may not
mean the end of the local upheaval.
   Menial laborers in the area have previously demonstrated against
low wages and other issues. But the scope of this week's violence
is extremely unusual for Japan, where issues rarely stir such
passions or protests.
   A police officer speaking on condition of anonymity said the
disturbance started Tuesday after an argument broke out between a
man who had been collecting cardboard in the streets and leftist
workers, one of whom was bitten by the man's dog.
   Police took the man into the station for questioning. Leftists
then took up the man's cause and massed outside. They began
shouting for the man's release and violence broke out after a
larger crowd gathered and accused the police of bribery, he said.
   The following day a local policeman from the Nishinari station
was arrested on suspicion of having taken $81,000 in bribes from
two gangsters in exchange for providing information about police
operations against the gang.
   Authorities said that menial laborers with longstanding grudges
against police joined the disturbance at first but gradually
dropped out, while outside hooligans and students as young as
junior high schoolers continued rioting.
   Police reported two stores were set ablaze early Friday and a
train station also was heavily damaged by fire. Several shops,
including a 24-hour convenience store, were looted.
   The rundown district, nicknamed the ``Airin'' district by
locals, is notorious for gangs, many transient laborers and shabby
hotels. Relations between residents and police are strained, locals
say.
   Local residents and human rights activists have complained about
police anti-crime measures, including 24-hour surveillance cameras
on street corners.

<HEAD>Accused S&amp;L Chief Says He is Innocent of Fraud Charges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Financier Charles Keating, who became a
symbol of the nation's thrift crisis, says he is ``absolutely''
innocent of fraud charges in junk bond sales arranged through his
failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.
   Keating and three co-defendants entered innocent pleas Friday to
an array of charges that accuse them of bilking investors in
American Continental Corp. junk bonds sold through Lincoln
branches.
   The Arizona developer listened quietly as Deputy District
Attorney William Hodgman read a summary of the 42-count indictment
in a packed courtroom.
   ``Mr. Keating, as to the charges against you in this indictment,
how do you now plead?'' asked Hodgman.
   ``Absolutely not guilty,'' Keating answered in a loud voice.
   Co-defendants Ray C. Fidel, Robin S. Symes and Judy Wischer,
officers of Lincoln or American Continental, then answered ``not
guilty'' to the charges. They are free but Keating has been unable
to post his $5 million bail.
   Keating, 66, was chairman of Phoenix-based American Continental,
which owned Irvine, Calif.-based Lincoln. The S&amp;L has failed and
experts estimate the cost of its bailout will reach $2 billion.
   Keating has been in jail since he surrendered to face the
indictment on Sept. 18 and bail was set at $5 million. Neal has
said Keating is broke and has argued for a reduction to $500,000, a
sum his children can help post.
   Prosecutors believe there were 17,458 bondholders who lost a
total of $250,138,000 on American Continental Corp. junk bonds,
most of which were sold at Lincoln branches in California.
   The indictment only lists 20 victims who lost $1,183,000.
Prosecutors say they limited the scope of the case to make it
easier for the jury to follow.
   The case was assigned for trial to Superior Court Judge Lance
Ito and a hearing was scheduled for Oct. 15 to discuss further
motions in the case.
   Each of the defendants could face as much as 10 years in prison
if convicted of six or more of the 42 counts.
   Fidel, 32, was president of Lincoln; Symes, 37, was its chief
executive officer; and Wischer, 42, was president of American
Continental. Fidel and Symes had to post $100,000 bail. Wischer had
to post $200,000.
   Outside court, defense attorney Stephen Neal said, ``Mr. Keating
is looking forward to defending himself on these charges.... He is
confident of being vindicated.''

   A Republican congressional
candidate who has suggested that government be run like a business
says he has two bankruptcy petitions pending.
   Gregory Cochran blamed his personal and business bankruptcy
actions on other people. He filed for personal bankruptcy in 1987
and bankruptcy on his defunct Cochran Exterminating Co. in 1988.
   He said the petitions are pending in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   Cochran opposes Democratic Rep. Bart Gordon in the November
election.
   ``I might say that bankruptcy is something that happens to
everyone - sometimes to many people,'' Cochran said. ``The man
(Abraham Lincoln) who started the Republican Party failed in
business and one of the best Democratic presidents, Harry Truman,
filed for bankruptcy.''
   He also said bankruptcy has helped prepare him for public
office.
   ``It shows I certainly know all the problems that you can get

   Democratic state treasurer candidate
Ray Shaffer says he's in a campaign bind because of voter sympathy
for his opponent, Bob Seale, hurt in a Labor Day plane wreck that
killed Seale's wife.
   Shaffer also questioned whether Seale would be ``emotionally
stable enough'' to handle the treasurer's job because of the death
of his wife, Judy.
   ``I have trouble bringing out the negatives because voters may
perceive it as attacking someone who is incapacitated,'' Shaffer
said.
   Seale was a landslide winner in the primary election a few days
after the plane wreck, defeating incumbent Treasurer Ken Santor
2-to-1 margin.
   ``I have compassion and sympathy for Bob, but ... all of a
sudden he is made out a hero and is the frontrunner ... I would not
want to see him elected because of sympathy,'' said Shaffer.
   Seale is expected to be released this week from a Reno hospital,
but probably will make only limited campaign appearances before the
Nov. 6 election.
   Brad Lawrence, Seale's campaign manager, refused to comment on
haffer's statements.

   Luck, a Republican lawyer, offered half the money needed by
WNPB-TV in Morgantown to televise the debate, scheduled Oct. 25 at
Alderson-Broaddus College in Philippi.
   Alvin Prichard, the station's programming director, said Friday
he cannot accept money from Luck's campaign without receiving a

   Staggers' campaign coordinator, Larry Thompson, did not say
whether Staggers would match Luck's offer, but predicted the debate

afford to broadcast the debate without sponsors or donations.

<HEAD>Researchers Warn Mosquito-Borne Disease Likely to Keep Spreading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mosquito-borne encephalitis outbreak
is likely to spread in Florida because the blood-sucking bugs
flourish through mid-December in the warm, moist climate,
scientists say.
   The state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services on
Friday confirmed 28 cases of St. Louis encephalitis and listed 10
more as likely cases involving the often disabling disease - all in
central and south Florida.
   ``Where it goes from here is anybody's guess,'' department
spokesman Ernie Durfee said in Tallahassee.
   Since the outbreak was first identified in mid-August, the
hardest-hit area has been the state's central Atlantic coast.
Indian River has 10 cases and three more presumed to be
encephalitis.
   Orange County - with the state's biggest tourist attractions -
has three confirmed and another person presumed to have it.
   Fifteen people are hospitalized and two - both over age 55 - are
comatose, health officials said.
   Researchers said they suspected as early as June that an
epidemic was imminent in Florida because of rainfall patterns and
the number of test chickens found to have been bitten by infected
mosquitos.
   ``We watched the epidemic unfold in front of us, right from the
beginning ... and we feel that possibly the worst part of the
epidemic may still be ahead,'' said Jonathan Day, an entomologist
with the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural
Sciences.
   Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain causing fever, sore
throat, headaches, confusion and muscular weakness. In severe cases
of this incurable disease, it causes convulsions, coma and death.
   The carrier is a small, brownish, common backyard mosquito that
officials say is relatively timid and bites only during nighttime
hours.
   Durfee said infants and those over 55 are most susceptible
because babies have undeveloped immune systems and older people
have depressed immune systems.
   The St. Louis strain last surfaced in Florida 13 years ago with
110 cases confirmed and eight deaths attributed to it.
   The disease is cyclical, occurring every 10 to 15 years because
of a combination of factors such as rainfall and mosquito
hatchings, Durfee said.
   But not all mosquitoes are carriers. ``Out of every 1,000
mosquitoes at random in Florida, four could carry the type virus.
And out of those four the number that have it is very low -
generally less than 1 percent,'' Durfee said.
   Ten to 14 days after a mosquito becomes infected, it can
transmit the virus through its bite. Mosquitoes can't pick up the
virus from infected humans, but they can from infected birds.
   ``We've been sampling mourning doves, common grackles, blue
jays, cardinals, mockingbirds and boat-tailed grackles,'' Day said.
``In the mourning doves and common grackles we're looking at 100
percent infection.''

<HEAD>`Graying' Catholic Church Hopes to Woo More Baby-Boomers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBRA HALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Catholic leaders gathered this weekend to plan
ways to attract the baby-boom generation, an age group that tends
to shy away from active Catholicism.
   ``The membership is acknowledging that their members are getting
grayer, getting older,'' said Paul K. Henderson of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington. ``The institution
recognizes itself that there is a significant component of the
population missing.''
   Data indicate the average parishioner is 47 years old, while the
average age of an American is 22, said John Fontana, chairman of
the Re-Generating Catholicism Steering Committee.
   ``There's a gap there. It's a gap that almost begins with the
baby boomers and beyond,'' Fontana, 40, said in an interview
Friday, the first day of the convention. The meeting ends Sunday.
   Besides thorny issues like the church's blanket condemnation of
abortion and birth control, a national trend of declining interest
in religion persists.
   ``It's not just the Catholic Church having this problem,'' he
said. ``It's also a problem in mainline Protestant churches.''
   William McCready, a public-opinion researcher from Northern
Illinois University, said young parishioners think ``the church
hasn't paid a lot of attention to them.''
   McCready, a scheduled speaker at the conference, said the bottom
line is that ``young people tend to shy away from organized
religion.''
   He said 25 percent of Americans are Catholics - between 55
million and 70 million people - with probably half of those being
active members.
   ``The fundamentalist churches have drawn some young people, but
nowhere near what the Catholic Church has lost. Most of them are
just sitting on the sidelines,'' said McCready, who is not a
Catholic.
   The conference defined a baby boomer as 25 to 45 years old, but
McCready said the term more accurately applies to people between 30
and 45. The baby boom was the great increase in the U.S. birthrate
in the years after World War II.
   Henderson, a committee member, said priests, in short supply,
are so busy they sometimes don't pay enough attention to young
adults.
   ``Somehow we're not making that linkage between the gospel
message and what young people are looking for: a sense of
direction,'' said Henderson, 37.
   He said church leaders had been advised that ``young adults do
not always feel welcome in parishes or in their churches'' and they
think activities too often are aimed at older adults.
   In the past, churches were the main place to socialize on
Sundays, but Fontana noted that different activities dominate an
increasingly secular United States.
   ``There is more competition for time,'' he said. ``There are
health clubs; there are shopping malls open on Sunday.''
   The church and youth leaders gathering in Chicago from around
the country don't expect to solve the problem at the conference,
but they want to identify and discuss possible solutions.
   Fontana, a doctor of ministry candidate, said declining
participation by the young comes despite an increase in young
people's interest in spirituality, documented in a Gallup survey.
   ``I'm not sure the church is tapping into that,'' he said. ``I
think they're putting forth doctrine rather than helping people
ascertain meaning in their lives.''
   Fontana, who works with young adults at Chicago's Old St.
Patrick's Church, said that church had grown from four to 1,200
members in the past seven years. Its members are predominantly
between 22 and 40.
   To woo young Catholics, Fontana said, priests and parishioners
must show hospitality to the newcomers - ``just greeting them,
welcoming them.''
   Also, he said, ``Our worship services need to speak to their
lives. Often times a homily doesn't connect with people's personal
lives.''

   Thousands of people are gathering
here this weekend to hear tall tales, old yarns and new stories, to
learn about heroic spiders and know-it-all crows, and to sympathize
with people on party lines.
   The occasion is the 18th annual National Storytelling Festival,
which takes place in Tennessee's oldest town.
   Hearing other people tell stories nurtures the soul, said Jane
McElroy, a veteran attending her fifth festival.
   ``It really speaks to something down deep,'' she said. ``It
makes us understand ourselves better.''
   Those who heard Johnny Moses on Friday also got to know his
story well. Moses, a Nootka shaman, told about the ``animal
people'' of years ago, repeating the opening line of the story four
times in his native language.
   ``Usually we repeat things four times in case you weren't
listening the first time, the second time or the third time,'' he
explained.
   Moses, known as Walking Medicine Robe, was chosen by his people
in Washington state and British Columbia, Canada, to pass on their
tribal traditions at the festival in Jonesborough, which was
founded in 1779.
   Moses told the story of ``Mr. Know It All,'' a crow that ignored
the warnings of the mosquito, the bear, the flea and the slug to
stay away from the beach. The bird wound up as Octopus Lady's
dinner.
   Donald Davis, a storyteller from Waynesville, N.C., told about
his Uncle Frank's experiences with modern technology in the form of
a telephone that had eight houses connected on one party line.
   Martha Holloway, a grandmother from Texas, told a story from
``The Prince of Tides'' by Pat Conroy, about a collection of black
widow spiders that saved two children from an intruder.
   This year's festival runs through Sunday and includes 17
featured storytellers. Sponsors say they expect 6,000 people to
attend.
   ``It just has a personal appeal - what it is I don't know,''
said Jean Currey, who made her fourth trip from Atlanta. ``Most of
them have a message of some sort.''
   The festival began in 1973 with four featured storytellers
speaking from the back of a farm wagon to an audience of about 60.
   ``I think there has been a tremendous renaissance in the last 15
years,'' says Milbre Burch, an Atlanta woman attending her sixth
festival. ``People just love to sit and listen to people tell
stories.''

   Here, at a glance, are the latest developments in the Persian
Gulf crisis:
   
   Iraq accused the United States and its allies of bringing ``the
entire world to the brink of a devastating war'' in a quest to gain
control of the Middle East's oil.
   In a speech Friday for the U.N. General Assembly, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz said the nations were seeking to control oil so
they could manipulate the ``needs of the world, and especially the
needs of the peoples of the Third World.''
   ---
   Israel reacted angrily to disclosures by Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak that Iraq and Israel have had indirect secret
contacts for years. Eliyahu Ben-Elissar, chairman of the Israeli
Parliament's defense and foreign affairs committee, on Friday
accused Mubarak of ``psychological warfare.''
   ---
   In Washington, five senators called for a Pentagon investigation
of how Iraq might have obtained the technology to make fuel-air
explosives. The Pentagon sought to play down any fears over the
explosives. They are highly effective against troops in the open,
but not against hardened targets like fortifications.
   ---
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein met in Baghdad with an aide to
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and accepted a message from
the Soviet leader. The official Iraqi News Agency did not disclose
its contents.

   The U.S. State Department said about 300 Americans and
foreign-born family members have signed up for an evacuation flight
due to leave Kuwait on Wednesday. U.S. officials say that at least
900 Americans remain trapped in Kuwait and Iraq.

   William F. Buckley Jr. says he plans to resign
within two weeks as ranking editor of the National Review, the
biweekly news magazine he founded 35 years ago as a bastion of
conservative thought.
   Buckley, who said he will take a position as editor at large,
announced his plans Friday night at the close of the magazine's
35th anniversary banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
   He said National Review's anniversary issue, to be published in
two weeks, would be his last as ranking editor.
   Buckley said in an interview with The New York Times that he is
also resigning as the magazine's chief executive officer and will
be succeeded by Wick Allison, the magazine's publisher. He said the
new ranking editor will be John O'Sullivan, who will also keep his
title as editor.
   Buckley said he has watched the magazine flourish over the
years.
   ``National Review is now recognized as a central journalistic
document,'' he said. ``Even people who oppose it would miss it, I
think, because they recognize that it is a crucible through which
conservative thought gets laundered and ventilated.''
   He added that the magazine ``did as much as anybody, with the
exception of himself, to shepherd into the White House Ronald
Reagan.''
   Buckley, 64, is also the longtime host of the public television
program ``Firing Line,'' as well as a syndicated columnist and the
author of several books.

<HEAD>Leading Paper Says Terry Waite to Be Released Next Week</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anglican church envoy Terry Waite and
other Western hostages in Lebanon might be released next week, the
nation's leading newspaper said today.
   The respected An-Nahar attributed the front-page report to
unidentified sources. It did not say how many hostages may be freed
and mentioned only Waite by name.
   The report said Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati is
to visit the Syrian capital of Damascus ``in the next two days for
consultations with the Syrian command'' of President Hafez Assad.
   Velayati, the sources said, also ``might travel to Beirut for
talks with President Elias Hrawi and other Lebanese officials.''
   Syria, with 40,000 peacekeeping troops deployed in predominantly
Moslem Lebanese regions since 1976, is the main power broker in
Lebanon.
   Iran is the main backer of Hezbollah, or Party of God, the
Shiite Moslem umbrella for underground factions holding most of the
13 Western captives missing in Lebanon, including four Britons.
   ``The release of a number of foreign hostages held in Lebanon,
topped by Anglican church envoy Terry Waite, is possible next
week,'' An-Nahar quoted the informed sources as saying. It did not
elaborate.
   An-Nahar has proved reliable in the past in its reports on the
hostages.
   The story contained only a one-paragraph reference to the
hostage issue. It also said Velayati was to work out with Syrian
and Lebanese leaders a settlement to the 3-year-old bloody power
struggle between Hezbollah and the mainstream Shiite Amal militia,
which has killed more than 1,000 people.
   Hussein Musawi, the Shiite mentor of some hostage-holding
factions, said Sept. 29 that the four British hostages would
benefit from the recently restored diplomatic ties between Britain
and Tehran.
   However, Musawi said the six American captives were not expected
to be released soon due to the American military deployment in the
gulf region following Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   The other Western captives are two West Germans and an Italian.
   There has been a flurry of reports about the possible release of
British hostages since Britain and Iran restored ties after a
rupture of 18 months over British author Salman Rushdie's novel
``The Satanic Verses.'' Moslems say the novel is blasphemous.
   ``Improving relations and the new British conduct toward Iran
would serve British interests in general, including the British
hostages,'' said Musawi, whose Islamic Amal movement is part of the
Hezbollah umbrella.
   Waite, 51, a personal emissary of Archbishop of Canterbury
Robert Runcie, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his hotel
in Moslem west Beirut for a meeting with Islamic Jihad, or Islamic
Holy War. The group is believed to hold American hostages Terry
Anderson and Thomas Sutherland.
   No group has claimed responsibility for Waite's abduction, but
former Irish hostage Brian Keenan, released in August, said he was
held with the Anglican envoy for a while in the same house.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest held among the 13 Western captives in
Lebanon. Anderson, 42, was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   In addition to Waite, the british captives are journalist John
McCarthy, World War II flier Jack Mann and writer Alec Collett.
   McCarthy, 33, of Barnet, North London, was kidnapped April 17,
1986, as he drove to Beirut airport to catch a flight to London.
   Mann, 76, was kidnapped in Beirut May 12, 1989. Collett, a New
York-based writer on assignment in Lebanon for the U.N. Relief and
Works Agency, was kidnapped March 25, 1985.
   The Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Moslems, believed
linked to Palestinian terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal, claimed April
23, 1986 it hanged Collett in retaliation for Britain's support of
the U.S. air raids on Libya earlier that month.
   The group released a videotape purportedly showing Collett, then
63, dangling from a scaffold. No body has been found, but British
officials believe Collett is dead.

   The U.N. General Assembly is expected to give final approval
Monday.
   Haiti is struggling to introduce democratic government. The
impoverished country, which declared independence from France in
1804, has been ruled by military force during most of its history.
   The last attempt at free elections collapsed in 1987 when thugs
backed by the army shot and hacked to death at least 34 voters.
   In recent months, former members of the security service of
ousted dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier have returned to Haiti. Many
Haitians worry they will interfere in the elections.
   Perez de Cuellar has indicated he will send 87 staff members, 80
election monitors and 150 military personnel at a cost of about $10
million.
   Haitian President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot opposes the presence of
armed personnel, however.
   Diplomats say most Haitians consider armed security men as
oppressors after three decades of dictatorship by the Duvalier
family.
   On Thursday, Haiti's Electoral Council signed an agreement with
the Organization of American States for about 25 OAS poll watchers
to monitor the campaign and election.
   Another team of election observers will be led by former
President Jimmy Carter.
   The request for U.N. observers touched off a battle in the
Security Council between the United States and a coalition of Cuba,
China and Colombia.
   The United States backed the plan. The other three nations
contended that there was no threat to international peace posed by
the Haitian situation and that the council therefore had no
jurisdiction.
   In announcing its electoral aid, the French Embassy in Haiti
said Friday that France was contributing the $2 million to support
a civic education campaign and the printing of ballots.
   The United States has pledged $6.4 million in electoral
assistance.

<HEAD>Sudan Allows Resumption of U.N. Relief Flights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudan has lifted its ban on U.N. emergency
relief flights to the rebel-held south, where a drought could kill
up to 1 million people, officials of the world body said.
   In meetings this week, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar talked with Sudan's military ruler, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
el-Bashir, about relief flights, a U.N. statement said Friday.
   Last weekend, the Sudanese government banned Red Cross and U.N.
relief flights to the south, where the Sudan People's Liberation
Army holds almost all of the three regions.
   ``The secretary-general expressed concern over the continued
intensified fighting in the southern region, including air attacks,
which had severely impeded relief efforts,'' the U.N. statement
said.
   At a follow-up meeting between Sudan's delegation and Abdulrahim
Farah, a U.N. undersecretary-general, Foreign Minister Ali Sahloul
of Sudan announced that the mercy flights could resume in his East
African nation.
   El-Bashir earlier announced a cease-fire with the southern
rebels until the end of the year so children there can be
vaccinated. He said it could lead to a cease-fire.
   El-Bashir said he had not received a reply from the rebels.
   Despite the progress, relief officials say famine threatens much
of Sudan, which has 25 million people. They also say Western donor
governments have not responded to calls by relief agencies for
help.
   ``I think we have the makings of a major humanitarian disaster,
a bombshell disaster, that hasn't caught the attention of the
world,'' said Richard Reid, UNICEF's regional director for the
Middle East and North Africa.
   The advancing drought is worse than the one that killed more
than 250,000 in 1988, he said.
   ``It is probable that unless there is focused and solid and
rapid intervention, we could lose at least 250,000, and it could go
up to the estimated 1 million that died in 1984,'' he said.
   Last year, Operation Lifeline Sudan, with UNICEF as the lead
agency, saved more than 200,000 lives when a similar drought
gripped Sudan, but this year few donor countries have been offering
help.
   Last year, UNICEF collected about $67 million for the relief
campaign.
   ``This year we have received practically nothing, less than $5
million,'' Reid said.
   ``Frankly, there is, up to now, on the part of everyone involved
in addressing this humanitarian need, a hesitancy, a semiparalysis,
a disarray, and a lack of focus. We certainly hope that will
change,'' he said.
   Diplomats said privately that distaste for el-Bashir's military
junta, which seized power from the elected government of Sadek
el-Mahdi last year, is a major reason that donations have dried up.
   El-Bashir's regime, dominated by Arab-descended Moslems, has
been fighting the ethnically African Christian and animist rebels
since 1983. The rebels have demanded more autonomy and an end to
Islamic law.
   Last year, the rebels and government suspended fighting along
relief corridors to let more than 100,000 tons of food and other
supplies be distributed.

<HEAD>First Snow of Season in Montana.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The first snow of the season fell in Montana early today, with
temperatures dipping below freezing, as clear skies prevailed
across much of the rest of the nation.
   Today's forecast called for as much as 6 inches of snow to
accumulate in the higher elevations of the southwest and central
mountains of Montana.
   In the northern and western mountains of Wyoming, 3 to 6 inches
were expected to accumulate.
   The dip in temperatures brought the first hard freeze of the
season, the National Weather Service said.
   It was minus 1 degree in Great Falls, Mont., early today.
   The drop in temperatures represented up to a 50-degree change
since Friday, when temperatures soared into the upper 70s and
mid-80s.
   The cold front moving across the Plains into the northern
Midwest was forecast to create high pressure of the Mid-Atlantic
region, causing summer-like temperatures in the Northeast.
   Scattered rain was expected in the lower Plains and norhtern New
England, but for the rest of the nation the weather was expected to
be dry.
   The nation's high on Friday was 104 degrees at Borrego Springs,
Calif.

   The independent South African Press Association said the home of
Monde Mandela in the black township of Soweto was attacked before

   Police gave no details on the death, and Monde Mandela's
relation to Nelson Mandela was not immediately clear. The news

   Nelson Mandela heads the African National Congress, the leading
opponent of South Africa's white-led government. His group and

<HEAD>Egypt Has Arrested Suspected Saboteurs From Iraq, Paper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have arrested 30 Arabs sent by
Iraq to attack city squares, tourist attractions and other targets
to create disorder, a state-owned newspaper said today.
   The suspects are 23 Palestinians and seven Iraqis, said the
Al-Ahram newspaper.
   President Hosni Mubarak said in a speech Thursday that Iraq had
sent saboteurs to Egypt and that some had been caught. He said they
had planned to bomb government offices and public transportation.
   Egypt is a leading Arab opponent of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
It has sent 14,000 soldiers to Saudi Arabia to join the U.S.-led
international force countering Iraq.
   In today's report, Al-Ahram, the leading state-owned paper, said
the suspects were arrested for entering Egypt on sabotage missions
masterminded by Iraq.
   It said four of the Palestinians belong to Abu-Nidal's terrorist
organization. They were deported three years ago but sneaked back
recently with forged passports, posing as tourists, the newspaper
said.
   Abu-Nidal, whose real name is Sabry el-Banna, heads a radical
PLO faction known as the Fatah-Revolutionary Council.
   It has its headquarters in Libya, but recent reports said it has
moved its base to Iraq.
   Maps pinpointing targets were found in the possession of the
suspected saboteurs, Al-Ahram said.
   It quoted Maj. Gen. Nabil Osman, an assistant to the interior
minister, saying that potential targets included tourist
attractions such as the pyramids, museums, hotels and crowded areas
like Cairo's main squares.
   The aim of the missions was to destabilize Egypt, the newspaper
said.
   Al-Ahram said the seven Iraqi suspects are members of the ruling
Iraqi Baath Party of President Saddam Hussein. It did not give the
names of the suspects.
   In addition to their sabotage missions, the newspaper said, the
Iraqis tried to establish terrorist cells in Egypt.
   In another case, a security official said Friday that a
Palestinian man and 15 Iraqis, including two women and two
defecting soldiers, were arrested for trying to enter Egypt with
false documents.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 16
were caught during the past four to five days at Cairo
International airport.
   He did not specify where they came from, but there have been
reports of earlier arrests of people arriving from Jordan.

<TEXT>
   An accused Soviet hijacker hanged
himself in a city jail after leaving a suicide note assailing
Moscow for its military intervention in Afghanistan, authorities
said today.
   Igor Suslov, one of 11 inmates from a Siberian prison camp
involved in the hijacking in August, was found hanging in his cell
late Friday, said a police spokesman on condition of anonymity.
   No one was injured in the hijacking, which began at the labor
camp in Neryungry, 3,500 miles east of Moscow, and ended in
Pakistan's southern port city of Karachi.
   All 11 hijackers sought political asylum but were charged with
hijacking. They have been awaiting a trial in Pakistan, despite
repeated extradition requests from Moscow.
   Authorities said Suslov left a cryptic suicide note blaming
Moscow for the deaths of 1.5 million Afghans and more than 13,000
Soviet soldiers in the Afghanistan civil war. Soviet soldiers had
been backing Afghanistan's government, but the last Soviet troops
pulled out in February 1989.
   In his note, Suslov also said the Soviet Union ``maltreated''
war veterans returning from Afghanistan, authorities said.
   It was not known whether Suslov ever served in Afghanistan.

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two U.S. Border Patrol agents have been placed
on administrative leave for crossing into Mexican territory in an
attempt to apprehend an illegal alien, it was reported today.
   The names of the two were not released.
   The disciplinary action came after The San Diego Union presented
several photographs to Border Patrol officials showing the agents
trying to catch the illegal alien on the Mexican side of a fence
dividing San Diego and Tijuana.
   When the agents noticed they were being photographed, they let
the man go, the newspaper said.
   The pictures were taken by Sergio Ochoa, a San Diego-area
college instructor, who witnessed the incident Sept. 23.
   Enrique Loaeza Tovar, the Mexican consul general in San Diego,
called the case a ``violation of international law,'' and said the
Mexican government likely would file a formal protest.
   Gustavo de la Vina, chief of the Border Patrol's San Diego
sector, called the incident regrettable.
   ``Our policy is quite specific that we don't operate in
Mexico,'' he said.

   Searchers equipped with
sophisticated radar, sonar and cameras will be probing Loch Ness,
beginning today, in a two-day hunt for its legendary monster and a
prize of nearly $480,000.
   It is the first major search for Nessie, as the fabled beast is
known, in three years.
   The William Hill Organization Ltd., national oddsmakers, have
offered $477,500 to the first person or team to discover conclusive
evidence of the creature's existence.
   A much smaller prize of $2,865 will go to the team or individual
judged to have the best search method.
   Four separate groups are taking part in the search, which is
based at the village of Drumnadrochit near the northern shore of
the Scottish Highlands lake. They range from serious contestants to
publicity seekers.
   Iain Bishop, deputy keeper of the zoology department of the
Natural History Museum in London, will examine any evidence found
on behalf of the oddsmakers. They stand to earn through bets placed
on Nessie's existence stimulated by publicity surrounding the
search.
   Andy Gray, 38-year-old managing director of a Scottish company
called Oceanscan that supplies underwater sonar equipment for the
North Sea oil industry, heads one team.
   He said its members are confident that if there is anything to
find, they will find it with their advanced underwater radar.
   Loch Ness is 754 feet deep, 23 miles long and a mile wide.
   A second group that calls itself the Rovers said it was using
remote-controlled underwater vehicles fitted with cameras to try to
track the monster.
   Londoner Daniel Isted, 25-year-old editor of a corporate
in-house magazine, said he will use what he called ``crystal
divination,'' suspending a crystal over the inky waters from a
yacht to try to find the beast. He said the crystal swings to
indicate direction.
   Former rock singer Screaming Lord Sutch, who as head of the
Monster Raving Loony Party has unsuccessfully run for Parliament,
said he too is hunting Nessie.
   Skeptical locals, who have seen it all before, looked on Friday
as the teams gathered. Television crews from the United States,
Japan, France, Britain and elsewhere filmed the scene.
   The last big hunt for the Loch Ness Monster was in October 1987,
when Operation Deepscan searchers with sonars reported detecting a
large ``fish-like arch'' at a depth of 450 feet at the southern end
of the lake.
   At the time, Deepscan spokesman Guy Pearse said the object
registered a clear, large blip on the sonar, but it was gone when
the boat scanned the area again.
   The legend of the Loch Ness Monster dates from 565 A.D. when St.
Columba, who converted Scotland to Christianity, castigated the
creature for attacking a follower.
   In modern times, there have been more than 4,000 reported
sightings of the monster. Skeptics have explained them away as
everything from waves, logs and rotting vegetation to otters,
swimming deer and overindulgence in Scottish whisky.

   Unidentified assailants hurled
a grenade and fired shots today at the home of relatives of Nelson
Mandela, killing a baby girl and injuring her parents, police said.
   African National Congress officials said the dead child and her
parents were distant cousins of Nelson Mandela. They denied South
African police and press reports that the child was Mandela's
great-granddaughter.
   Police said they did not know who was responsible for the
attack. No group took immediate responsibility.
   Police Lt. Govindesamy Mariemuthoo said the attack occurred
before dawn at the home of Monde Mandela in the black township of
Soweto. The blast badly damaged part of the house, knocking holes
in the wall and causing extensive damage.
   The police officer said a baby girl was killed and her parents
injured. He gave no other detail on the victims.
   He said the room in which the injured couple had been sleeping
was destroyed.
   ANC officials said the dead child was the great niece of
Mandela's father, making her a distant cousin of Nelson Mandela.
The dead girl's father, Monde Mandela, runs a small grocery shop.
   The ANC officials said Nelson Mandela was close to the Monde
Mandela family.
   An ANC statement said, ``The ANC notes the curious coincidence
of an attack on a man bearing the Mandela name at this time.''
   Given the distant connection between Mandela and the family,
police said they did not know if the attack was deliberate or just
a random attack linked to the general violence.
   Mandela was reportedly attending a political meeting in the
eastern province of Natal today.
   Soweto and other black townships around Johannesburg have been
hit by black factional fighting that has killed about 800 people
since August. The fighting has pitted followers of the ANC against
Zulus of the conservative Inkatha group.
   Mandela has repeatedly accused security forces of manipulating
the violence to derail government efforts to end apartheid and
share power with the black majority. The police have denied
Mandela's charges.
   Mandela was released in February after 27 years in jail for
opposing the white minority government. He is closely guarded by
ANC operatives, and there have been reports of threats on his life
in recent months.
   Mandela and other ANC leaders have been negotiating with
President F.W. de Klerk to pave the way for full-scale talks on
ending apartheid, the South African system of racial separation. De
Klerk has promised to end white-minority rule.

   A list of the worst excuses offered by
Oklahoma parents who are delinquent in making child-support
payments includes: ``I've got to pay my cable TV bill.''
   State Department of Human Services officials announced Friday
that they will make public some of the dubious excuses they hear,
by releasing the ``Worst Excuse of the Month.''
   The worst of the worst seems to be one from a parent seemingly
more interested in his channel selection than his kids. He wrote he
``can't afford to pay child support. I've got to pay my cable TV
bill this month.''
   The state agency already puts out a monthly 10 Most Wanted list
of delinquent parents.
   The excuses parents give for late payments range from ``sad to
silly,'' said Bruce Walker, head of the DHS department that
oversees child support payments. More than $35 million in
delinquent payments were collected last year, he said.
   In other excuses, one parent said, ``We only had sex one time. I
couldn't be the father.''
   One man admitted he had been ordered to pay $25 a week, but said
``I'll not allow my ex-wife to get rich on my money.''
   Another man said, ``She's receiving welfare, so she doesn't need
child support.''
   One parent said he had recently bought groceries for his
children and added, ``I always get them Christmas and birthday
presents. What's the problem?''

   Klaus weakened from a hurricane to
a tropical storm today as it churned toward the Virgin Islands,
after leaving at least six dead and 1,500 homeless from flooding in
Martinique.
   Klaus' winds decreased from 75 mph to 70 mph early today and the
National Weather Service in Miami said some further decrease in
strength was possible over the next 24 hours.
   The storm skirted Antigua on Friday, tearing roofs from houses
but causing no major damage, then continued its trek up the
northeastern Caribbean island chain. The heaviest rain was falling
just offshore, the weather service said.
   Hurricane warnings were changed to tropical storm advisories for
the northern Leeward chain, and British and U.S. Virgin Islands,
the Miami Weather Service said.
   In San Juan, the National Weather Service said Klaus would
probably be centered 170 miles northeast of St. Thomas in the U.S.
Virgin Islands by this afternoon. A weather bulletin warned
residents ``to take necessary precautions for the protection of
life and property.''
   On its present course, Klaus would stay to the east of the
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, the weather service said, but
added: ``There is some uncertainty in its projected movement at the
current time.''
   It was not known whether the storm would reach the continental
United States.
   Klaus was upgraded from a tropical storm Friday. Tropical storms
become hurricanes when winds reach a sustained speed of 74 mph.
Klaus is the 11th named storm and the sixth hurricane of the
Atlantic hurricane season.
   At 6 a.m. EDT today, Klaus was centered near latitude 18.3 north
and longitude 62.2 west, or about 60 miles east-northeast of Saint
Martin, according to the weather service. Tropical storm-force
winds extended 115 miles east and 40 miles west of the center.
   Forecasters said the system was drifting northwest at 6 mph
after being stalled for several hours off the coast of Antigua. It
was expected to continue in the same direction today, the Miami
Weather Service said.
   Antigua, a popular tourist resort 250 miles southeast of Puerto
Rico, was buffeted by high winds and intermittent rain on Friday.
   Zinc roofs were ripped from a few houses, but there were no
reports of serious damage or injuries, said Stan Cieniewicz,
administrative officer for the Antigua-baed Pan-Caribbean Disaster
Preparedness and Prevention Project.
   ``It was practically nothing at all,'' he said.
   On Dutch St. Maarten, traffic jams built up in the capital,
Philipsburg, and long lines formed outside grocery and hardware
stores as residents stocked up on supplies. Schools were closed,
and many people stayed home to board up windows.
   In Anguilla, a tiny British colony of 7,500, Gov. Brian Canty
said the island began hurricane preparations Thursday.
   ``All government offices are now battened down, and we have put
our emergency plan into effect,'' he said. ``Insofar as it is
possible to work normally with all our hurricane shutters up ... it
is business as usual.''
   As of today, the French island of Martinique south of the
Leewards was by far the hardest hit by the storm. Heavy rain since
Tuesday spawned landslides and serious flooding, blocking many
roads and forcing 1,500 people from their homes.
   Authorities said six people were killed, including two young
sisters who were swept from a bridge Wednesday. Two fishermen, a
father and son, were also reported missing.

   The Foreign Office said today that a 46-year-old
British man has died in Kuwait.
   William Norrie Atack, a Scottish scientist, had worked in Kuwait
for eight years as a scientific officer at the ministry of public
health, his family said in a statement.
   ``It is understood that he took ill but did not recover. The
cause of his death is not known,'' the statement said.
   The Foreign Office said it was negotiating for the return of
Atack's body with Iraqi officials, who have controlled Kuwait since
the Aug. 2 invasion.
   Iraqi officials have allowed Western women and children to leave
Iraq and Kuwait since the invasion but have prohibited Western men
from leaving.

   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack
Kemp has endorsed Conservative Party gubernatorial candidate
Herbert London over Kemp's fellow Republican Pierre Rinfret,
according to a published report.
   Kemp, a former congressman from Buffalo, made the endorsement
Friday night at National Review magazine's 35th anniversary
celebration, The New York Times reported in today's late editions.
   London and Rinfret are running against Gov. Mario Cuomo in the
Nov. 6 statewide election.
   London, who did not attend the dinner, said earlier he didn't
expect to get Kemp's endorsement.
   In his endorsement, Kemp also took shots at Rinfret who has come
under fire for his public criticism of fellow Republicans,
including state party leaders. ``Any candidate who runs for
governor of New York and criticizes Ronald Reagan for cutting taxes
does not deserve to be our candidate,'' Kemp said.

<HEAD>Princess Caroline's Husband Buried as Thousands Mourn</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Several thousand people crowded
around the cathedral today where a tearful funeral was held for
Princess Caroline's husband, Stefano Casiraghi, killed in a
boat-racing accident.
   The 33-year-old princess, wearing sunglasses, a heavy black-lace
head-covering and black dress, wept occasionally during the
55-minute service.
   Casiraghi, 30, an Italian businessman, was killed instantly
Wednesday when his boat flipped while racing at high speed in the
World Offshore Racing championships.
   The somersault ejected co-pilot Patrice Innocenti, who was
hospitalized with injuries. Casiraghi, defending the championship
he won in 1989 in Atlantic City, N.J. remained strapped in the
boat, which slammed him headfirst into the ocean.
   ``The brutality of his death adds to our pain,'' intoned Roman
Catholic Archbishop of Monaco Joseph Sardou during the solemn
ceremony. ``The sea, so calm today, holds dangers that must
constantly be confronted.''
   Caroline sat in the front row between her father, Prince
Rainier, and brother, Prince Albert.
   Princess Stephanie, Caroline's younger sister, wept throughout
and had to exit the service for a short time. Albert left briefly
to comfort her.
   Caroline's three children from her seven-year marriage to
Casiraghi were not present.
   Sardou praised Casiraghi as ``an exemplary sportsman and
businessman,'' but said, referring to Caroline: ``It was through
his union with you, madame, that he found the greatest expression
of his Christian faith.''
   Pallbearers carried Casiraghi's mahogany coffin to the nearby
Chapel of Peace for burial in a spot overlooking the stretch of
Mediterranean where his boat flipped over.
   The 115-year-old cathedral could hold just 1,600 of the several
thousand mourners who began lining up early today to attend the
ceremony. The rest remained outside.
   Mourners allowed entrance included Danielle Mitterrand, wife of
French president Francois Mitterrand, and a host of celebrities,
businessmen and political figures from around Europe.
   Thousands of large and small floral bouquets covered the
cathedral steps in a myriad of bright colors and pastels, offerings
from Monaco subjects, corporations and the principality's famous
casinos.
   Brightly colored shorts and T-shirts worn by tourists contrasted
with the stark black worn by Monaco's citizens. Armed police kept a
close watch on the crowd.
   Casiraghi's accident marks the second time in eight years the
royal family ruling this wealthy Riviera principality has suffered
sudden, tragic death.
   In September 1982, Princess Grace - former Hollywood star Grace
Kelly - died of injuries suffered in a car accident. Princess Grace
was Rainier's wife and the mother of Caroline, Albert and
Stephanie.
   Most of Monaco's small shops closed for an hour during the
ceremony.
   Sardou's eulogy drew tears from mourners, some of whom remebered
Princess Grace's death.
   ``I was here for Grace's funeral and now I'm here to mourn young
Stefano. There is a curse on the royal house,'' said one elderly
Italian woman.
   A white-uniformed, five-man honor guard wearing red-tasseled
hats stood stiffly at attention during the ceremony. Sunlight
steamed through the small stained-glass windows.
   Caroline wept as she walked out holding her father's arm.
   The princess decided to bury her husband at the simple chapel
over the objection of her in-laws, who wanted him interred in
Italy, French and Italian newspapers reported.
   Casiraghi married Caroline in a civil ceremony in 1983.
   He had been racing at world-class level since 1984 and had told
friends he planned to quit after this season.

   Discovery thundered into orbit today
with five astronauts and a nuclear-powered sun probe, ending the
shuttle fleet's second-longest grounding ever and boosting NASA's
battered credibility.
   The 100-ton spaceship rode a 700-foot-pillar of flame at 7:47
a.m. EDT through a thin bank of clouds and then into a sky flushed
by a rising sun.
   The liftoff was 12 minutes late because of showers near a
shuttle emergency landing runway at the Kennedy Space Center and a
momentary technical glitch.
   Discovery began NASA's 36th shuttle flight and the first in 5{
months. The probe tucked inside its cargo bay was to be sent on a
1.86 billion-mile journey to study the sun's unexplored poles.
   Two minutes into the flight, the two solid fuel rockets burned
out and dropped into the Atlantic Ocean. Discovery continued upward
on the thrust of its three main liquid fuel engines, reaching a
184-mile-high orbit 6{ minutes later.
   ``It was just a fantastic sight to see this thing go,'' said Ed
Massey, a project administrator for NASA. ``We think it's
fantastic, and it's also a great plus to the nation that the
shuttle fleet is up and flying again.''
   ``After 18 years, you can't help but feel good,'' said scientist
Edgar Page, who started working on the project in 1972 for the
European Space Agency.
   NASA had been counting on a successful flight to help boost its
image, battered this year by a string of failed launch attempts,
the Hubble Space Telescope's flawed mirror and this week's accident
involving another shuttle, Atlantis.
   Workers forgot to remove a 9-foot-long beam from Atlantis, and
the metal piece banged around the orbiter as it was being lifted
into an upright position.
   Launch director Bob Sieck said he did not know whether to
describe the team's mood today as ``one of euphoria or relief.''
   Sieck said the team was confident heading into liftoff ``in
spite of the distractions and the disappointments that have
occurred recently, which would tend to overshadow a lot of good
work that's been put in to get ready for this mission.''
   ``The team worked real hard for this, Sieck said. ``They earned
it. They got their reward - finally.''
   The major hurdle to launch - fueling - went smoothly. No
dangerous leaks were detected as more than 500,000 gallons of
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen gushed into the shuttle's
external tank earlier today.
   NASA's two other space shuttles, Columbia and Atlantis, sprouted
hydrogen leaks during fueling and had to be returned to the hangar
for repairs. Discovery was the last shuttle to fly, in April, and
is the only craft in which hydrogen leaks were not found.
   The longest shuttle-fleet grounding was 2{ years, after
Challenger exploded shortly after liftoff in January 1986, killing
all seven crew members. Discovery also was the first shuttle to fly
after that hiatus, launching a successful mission in September
1988.
   The latest Discovery mission isn't being affected by a shutdown
of government agencies because of the dispute over the federal
budget. Kennedy Space Center spokesman Dick Young said funds for
the mission already had been set aside.
   A federal judge in Washington also sided with NASA on Friday in
denying a request by environmentalists to delay the mission for
safety reasons.
   The solar probe Ulysses contains nearly 23.7 pounds of
radioactive plutonium-238. It will provide electricity for the
807-pound satellite during its five-year, $750 million mission to
study the sun's poles.
   Ulysses would be the first spacecraft to orbit over the sun's
polar regions. All previous craft circled over the equator.
   NASA's chief scientist, Lennard Fisk, said he expects Ulysses to
``revolutionize our knowledge of the sun and the region of space
that surrounds it.'' The European Space Agency satellite has been
waiting to be carried aloft since 1983.
   About six hours after liftoff, Discovery's crew, commanded by
veteran astronaut Dick Richards, was to send the spacecraft
hurtling toward the planet Jupiter at a speed of 34,450 mph, making
it the fastest man-made object in relation to Earth.
   The crew was given the go-ahead two hours into the flight to
begin reparing for Ulysses' deployment.
   While swinging around Jupiter, Ulysses will receive a gravity
assist that will slingshot it toward the sun. The satellite is
expected to pass over the sun's south pole in 1994 and the north
pole in 1995.
   The rest of the four-day mission involves experiments, including
one in which a fire would be started in a sealed chamber in an
effort to improve safety on future flights.
   In addition to Richards, the crew consists of pilot Robert
Cabana and mission specialists William Shepherd, Bruce Melnick and
Thomas Akers.

   Today's launch of the Ulysses spacecraft
aboard the shuttle Discovery delighted European and NASA officials
whose agencies began discussing the solar exploration mission 18
years ago.
   ``Everybody's absolutely elated,'' said Willis Meeks, NASA's
Ulysses project manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which
will serve as mission control for the sun-orbiting spacecraft.
   Before today's launch, ``I was waiting for the nerves to come,''
Meeks said. ``A couple of minutes after liftoff, my body went crazy
for five seconds.''
   Ulysses, which will orbit the sun's poles in 1994 and 1995, rode
into Earth orbit as space shuttle Discovery was launched from Cape
Canaveral, Fla. It was to be deployed from the shuttle later today.
   The $750 million mission is a joint project of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and the European Space Agency.
The Europeans will control Ulysses from NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, while NASA officials will provide tracking and other
ground support. NASA's Johnson Space Center in Texas serves as
mission control for the shuttle flight.
   About 50 ESA and NASA engineers and scientists in the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory's mission support area broke into applause
and shook hands with each other as Discovery lifted off. Another 50
VIPs watched the launch on closed-circuit television from the
laboratory's auditorium.
   ``We are very pleased this was such a wonderful launch,'' said
Willy Brado, ESA's assistant director of operations. ``Now an
exciting and very interesting mission can begin.''
   Meeks said the idea for a mission to explore the sun's polar
regions was devised in 1959 by John Simpson at the University of
Chicago. Discussions between NASA and ESA started in 1972, said
Edgar Page, Ulysses science coordinator for the European agency.
   The launch of twin spacecraft first was planned for 1983, then
rescheduled for 1985. In 1981, NASA's budget woes reduced the
mission to a single satellite due for launch in May 1986. The Jan.
28, 1986, explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger forced
another delay.
   ``We had a lot of hiccups over the years,'' Page said, adding
that finally seeing Ulysses in space means ``you can't help but
feel good.''
   ``I've been waiting for this since the early 1970s,'' said Bruce
Goldstein, NASA's deputy project scientist for Ulysses. ``It's been
a long time.''
   Brado said the launch will help restore the confidence of
European governments in manned space flights for launching
scientific spacecraft.
   ``I have to congratulate NASA on this very successful and very
impressive launch,'' Brado said. ``If this had failed, it would
have had repercussions at ESA.''
   Meeks added: ``I'm feeling really great. We needed this one.''

   Iraq told U.N. members that the United
States and its allies were trying to control the world's oil
reserves, but the U.S. ambassador dismissed the charges as lies.
   Other nations, including the Soviet Union, joined the angry
replies to Iraq's latest accusations, made in a speech at the
United Nations on Friday. Saudi Arabia's ambassador said Iraq had
committed ``an unforgivable crime, a crime to shine in the history
of crimes'' by invading Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has recalled its ambassador to Jordan,
diplomatic sources said today, in another indication of souring
relations between the Arab neighbors over the Persian Gulf crisis.
Jordan has shown pro-Iraqi sympathies.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had no
information on the reasons that precipitated the Saudi decision.
The recall of ambassador Mohammed al-Fahd al-Isa is tantamount to a
freeze of relations between the two kingdoms.
   In Washington, there was renewed concern over Iraq's military
potential. Five senators called for a Pentagon study of how Iraq
might have gained technology to make so-called fuel-air explosives.
   The bombs have 10 times the power of conventional explosives
without the fallout of nuclear weapons. Military officials say the
United States has no ready defense against the explosives, which
could devastate oil fields, air bases and troops, the Los Angeles
Times newspaper reported Friday.
   In a prepared speech to the U.N. General Assembly, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz accused the United States and its allies of
bringing ``the entire world to the brink of a devastating war'' in
a quest to control the Middle East's oil.
   He said the United States and its friends ``are seeking to gain
control over the oil reserves in the gulf so as to have a free hand
in manipulating the needs of the world, and especially the needs of
the peoples of the Third World, for this important commodity.''
   Aziz said the U.N. Security Council was hypocritical when it
penalized Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait while allowing Israel to
continue occupying Arab lands seized in wars in 1967 and 1973.
   In the speech read by an Iraqi envoy, Sabah Talat Kadrat, Aziz
said all Middle East problems - ``Palestine, Lebanon, the gulf and
others'' - should be considered on the same basis.
   Aziz did not come to New York to deliver it because the United
States denied landing rights for the Iraqi delegation's plane.
   Kadrat and the Iraqi delegation left the hall when a Kuwaiti
delegate, D. Razzooqi, replied that ``there are no falsifications
of facts similar to what we have heard from the representative of
dictator Saddam Hussein.''
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering called Iraq's address ``an
insult to the Iraqi people, who deserve to be told no more lies.''
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky rebuked Iraq,
saying, ``We cannot but feel some satisfaction at the unprecedented
unity in the Security Council.''
   The United States and other nations have sent tens of thousands
of troops and scores of warships to the gulf region in a bid to
force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. The United Nations has imposed
air and sea embargoes on Baghdad and said force may be used to
uphold it.
   In other developments:
   -In Cairo, a state newspaper said today that authorities have
arrested 30 Arabs - 23 Palestinians and seven Iraqis - sent by Iraq
to attack city squares, tourist attractions and other targets to
create disorder.
   -Also in Cairo, the PLO's chief representative in Egypt today
urged Palestinians living here not to be drawn into actions aimed
at ``destabilizing Egypt's security.''
   -In London, the Foreign Office said today a 46-year-old British
man has died in Kuwait after suffering an undisclosed illness. The
man, William Norrie Atack, a Scottish scientist, had worked in
Kuwait for eight years as a scientific officer at the ministry of
public health, his family said.
   -The British Foreign Office also said that two of the four
British Embassy staff in Kuwait left today for Baghdad. Britain
made the decision to withdraw the two men last month, to leave more
supplies for the two remaining.
   -An aide to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev left Iraq
today after meeting with Saddam a day earlier. He reportedly
carried a message to Saddam from the Soviet leader. Its contents
were not disclosed.
   -In Washington, the State Department said 300 Americans and
foreign-born family members have signed up for an evacuation flight
to leave Kuwait on Wednesday. U.S. officials say that 900 Americans
remain trapped in Kuwait and Iraq.

   Phnom Penh has been cut off from Western air service since
Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978, driving the murderous Khmer Rouge

   A boat capsized in a flood-swollen

their inundated village, news reports said Saturday.
   The accident Friday on the Padma River, 25 miles north of Dhaka,
raised to 20 the number of people who have drowned since floods hit
northern Bangladesh last week.
   At least 1 million people have had to leave their homes because
of flooding that has washed away dozens of villages in six of the
country's 64 districts, authorities said. Floods earlier in the
monsoon season killed at least 70 people.
   The New Nation, a Dhaka-based daily, said the accident victims
were attempting to reach safer areas from their inundated village.
   Floods are an annual occurrence in Bangladesh during the summer
monsoon. During the 1988 monsoon, about 1,400 people were killed in
flooding and about four-fifths of the low-lying nation was
inundated.

   The British government has banned a German
described as a neo-Nazi from entering the country on the grounds
his presence would not be conducive to the public good.
   Home Secretary David Waddington said in a statement Friday that
Manfred Roeder, 61, would be refused entry.
   Roeder was due to address the annual rally of the far-right,
anti-immigrant British National Party in London on Oct. 13.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association described
Roeder as a convicted right-wing terrorist and former member of the
Hitler Youth organization in Nazi Germany.
   It said he heads the extreme nationalist organization German
Citizens' Initiative.
   It said he was released from prison in Germany earlier this year
after serving eight years of a 13-year sentence for his part in
firebomb attacks in which two Vietnamese immigrants died.
   The decision to ban Roeder follows a letter to Waddington by
opposition Labor Party legislator Greville Janner, a former
president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, urging him to
make the exclusion order.

<TEXT>
   A grenade and shotgun attack
Saturday killed a baby girl related to Nelson Mandela, and his
African National Congress called the incident a ``curious
coincidence.''
   Police said unknown assailants hurled a grenade and fired shots
before dawn at the home of Monde Mandela in the black township of
Soweto. The attack killed Gloria Mandela, 1, and injured her
parents, Monde, 43, and Susan, 29, police said.
   There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the attack.
Police said they did not know if the attack was deliberate or a
random incident linked to the chronic violence in Soweto and other
townships.
   ANC officials said Nelson Mandela is close to the Monde Mandela
family, who are distant cousins. They said Nelson Mandela's father
was the brother of Monde Mandela's grandfather.
   The blast and ensuing fire badly damaged half the house. One
room was destroyed, with the roof collapsed and charred debris
strewn throughout. The body of a badly burned dog lay inside.
   Monde Mandela, who runs a small grocery store, and his wife were
hospitalized with serious burns, police said.
   Nelson Mandela has led the ANC since his February release from
27 years in prison for trying to overthrow the white-led
government.
   His supporters have been fighting Zulus loyal to the
conservative Inkatha movement for supremacy among South Africa's
black opposition groups.
   The warfare has killed 5,000 blacks in eastern Natal Province in
five years. It spread in August to black townships around
Johannesburg, where some 800 people have died.
   The government and ANC have held peace talks since May on ending
the apartheid system of racial segregation and setting up
negotiations on sharing power with the black majority.
   Mandela has repeatedly accused security forces of instigating
the black-on-black violence to try to destabilize the country and
derail peace talks. Police have denied the charges.
   Mandela, the ANC deputy president attended political meetings
Saturday in Durban and issued no immediate comment on the attack,
ANC officials said.
   An ANC statement said the assailants hurled a grenade and fired
shotguns in the attack. It said the organization noted ``the
curious coincidence of an attack on a man bearing the Mandela name
at this time.''
   Since his release from prison, Mandela has been closely guarded
by ANC operatives. There have been reports of threats against his
life.
   Right-wing extremists who support strict apartheid have opposed
the ANC-government talks and possible power-sharing with blacks.
Some right-wing groups have threatened armed struggle against a
black government and claimed responsibility for bombings and other
violence in recent months.

   Five years ago, Italy had its hands on Mohammed
Abbas but let him go.
   Now the man convicted of masterminding the hijacking of the
cruise ship Achille Lauro is back in the headlines and threatening
new attacks on Western interests.
   The Baghdad-based Palestinian guerrilla leader, also known as
Abul Abbas, has warned he will attack U.S. aircraft if Iraqi planes
are hit during attempts to enforce the U.N. air embargo against
Iraq.
   The hint of possible bombings or hijackings have raised the
specter of a new wave of terrorism in the Mediterranean area, which
was bloodied by terrorist atrocities in the mid-1980s.
   One of the most daring assaults of that time was the hijacking
of the Achille Lauro as it steamed off the coast of Egypt on Oct.
7, 1985, with 511 passengers aboard on a cruise that began in
Genoa.
   A wheelchair-bound American passenger, Leon Klinghoffer, was
killed by the hijackers, who dumped his body overboard. American
attempts to bring Abbas to justice led to severe strains in
U.S.-Italian relations.
   The ship was hijacked by four young men belonging to an
extremist PLO splinter group headed by Abbas, called the Palestine
Liberation Front. They demanded that Israel release 50 imprisoned
Palestinians.
   The hijacking ended Oct. 9 after Egypt negotiated with the
hijackers. Abbas, who was involved in negotiating the surrender,
and the four hijackers were flown out of Egypt on an Egyptian jet
that was intercepted by American fighters and forced to land in
Sicily.
   Tensions arose as soon as the plane landed. Armed U.S. and
Italian soldiers faced off, each side demanding custody of the
hijackers. The situation was only resolved after feverish telephone
calls between Premier Bettino Craxi and President Reagan.
   The Italians took custody of the four and promised to try them,
but refused to detain Abbas, saying the evidence compiled by
Washington was insufficient and that he held an Iraqi diplomatic
passport. Within two days, he was slipped out of the country.
   In an elaborate ruse, Abbas was kept aboard the Egyptian plane
and flown from one Rome airport to another to board a Yugoslav
airlines commercial flight to Belgrade. Craxi's office later said
the mode of departure was arranged at the request of Egypt to
prevent another interception by the Americans.
   But two weeks later, Italian magistrates filed charges against
Abbas and issued an arrest warrant.
   In June 1986 he was tried in abstentia, convicted and sentenced
to life imprisonment for masterminding the hijacking. The sentence
was upheld on appeal.
   The Italians still have warrants outstanding for Abbas' arrest,
but in January 1988 the U.S. Justice Department withdrew its
warrant to the dismay of the Klinghoffer family.
   His dauhters said Abbas should be held accountable in U.S.
courts. The Justice Department said it acted after a review of the
case and Abbas' conviction and sentence by an Italian court.
   At the trial in Genoa, prosecutors charged that the hijackers
shot Klinghoffer in the head and chest after Syria refused a
request to help arrange negotiations for the Palestinians held by
Israel. They said the hijackers planned to kill American and
British passengers, one every five minutes, unless the prisoners
were freed.
   But the prosecutors insisted they developed the case in the days
following Abbas' departure. The government vigorously denied it had
been soft on terrorism or had struck some deal with the PLO.
   In recent interviews at his heavily guarded office in Baghdad,
Abbas was unrepentant about the killing of Klinghoffer.
   ``Can you name one Palestinian killed by the Israelis?'' he
demanded of a Newsweek correspondent when questioned about the
death of the 69-year-old American.
   He repeated his contention that the hijackers' real intention
was to launch a raid in Ashdod, the Israeli port that was the
ship's next stop after Port Said, Egypt.
   Abbas' latest threats come amid other recent warnings from
Palestinian groups threatening retaliation for any harm that comes
to Iraq.
   In the days since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Italy, for
one, has taken seriously the possibility of new terrorist attacks.
Italian officials decline to give details but security has been
increased on roads leading to the main Rome airport and extra
guards have been posted outside government buildings, U.S.
installations, embassies and other possible targets.

   A Frenchman who already holds the record
for the fastest ascent of Mount Everest has climbed the world's
tallest mountain again with two compatriots, the Tourism Ministry
said.
   A ministry statement said Marc Batard, a 39-year-old alpine
guide, reached the top of the 29,028-foot mountain Friday through
the traditional southeast ridge.
   The statement, citing a radio message from the base camp, said
Batard was accompanied by Pascal Tour Naire, a 40-year-old
photographer, and the team physician, Christin Janin, 32.
   Five hours before the three men reached the top, another
Frenchman, Eric de Camp, 35, and two Nepalese Sherpa guides reached
the peak.
   Batard had climbed the Everest in 1988 in 22 hours, the fastest
ascent ever by a mountaineer. It was not known how long he took to
reach the peak Friday.

   Goodbye East Germany. Hello headaches, huge
expenses and probably higher taxes.
   First, that ``wall in the mind'' must be broken through as
Germany perfects its union. Then there is the problem of how to
play a greater international role without frightening the
neighbors.
   Two recent announcements foreshadow what awaits now-dissolved
East Germany economically: an enormous investment to modernize
telecommunications, but no help for a camera company that employs
thousands.
   Jobs will be created by the telecommunications project, but
gradually, over seven years.
   Pentacon, the camera company in Dresden, will close, throwing
nearly 4,000 people out of work. It is the biggest business failure
yet in the collapsing economy of what was an independent nation
until midnight Tuesday.
   The holiday for unification was Wednesday, a day for prayers in
ecumenical church services and thoughtful speeches by national
leaders, framed by the glorious music of Germany's great composers.
   On Thursday, it was back to business, to news of burgeoning
unemployment and the slow, expensive process of dragging the
formerly Communist region up to national standards.
   Psychological problems accompany the economic. More than 40
years of stark political division created two kinds of Germans.
   ``It will take a long time to have one state with one people who
really understand each other,'' Mayor Walter Momper said on the eve
of unification of his nation and of Berlin, his city.
   People in the East ``have less initiative than we have,'' he
said. ``Everything was determined by the party, the bureaucracy and
the government.''
   He said another major problem was the legacy of the Stasi, the
defunct East German secret police. Its 6 million files are sealed,
their fate to be determined by Parliament after national elections
in December.
   ``The poison is everywhere,'' Momper said of the Stasi.
   Markus Wolf, the retired East German spymaster, is reported to
have fled to the Soviet Union. His successor, Werner Grossman, was
arrested Wednesday in eastern Berlin. It may have been a holiday,
but prosecutors hunting East German spies did not take the day off.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl used the occasion to tell other countries
a united Germany would strive for peace and never forget the harsh
lessons of its Nazi past.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced plans to visit Germany in
November, making him the first important foreign guest after
unification and illustrating the swift improvement of relations
with the Soviet Union.
   A friendship treaty has been initialed and Germans generally
credit Gorbachev with the collapse of East German communism.
Germany has promised $9.5 billion to finance the withdrawal of the
370,000 Soviet troops in former East Germany by the end of 1994.
   Kohl has pledged that Germany will strive for European unity
without seeking domination, sign a treaty with wary Poland
guaranteeing its border, alter laws to permit German troops to
serve on foreign peace-keeping missions, and aid poor nations.
   Most Germans foresee higher taxes, but the government has said
nothing definite. Kohl speaks of ``sacrifices'' ahead, and
estimates of the cost of rehabilitating eastern Germany's five
states range up to 1.2 trillion marks - $775 billion - over five
years.
   Deutsche Telekom, a telecommunications arm of the
government-owned postal service, said Thursday it would invest $35
billion over seven years to modernize the East's obsolete
communications network.
   Managers from East and West were assembled in a chandeliered
hall of a Prussian palace on the Unter den Linden and given
marching orders for the ``fused'' national telephone company.
Several hundred phone workers from the East, worried about their
jobs, demonstrated outside.
   Helmut Ricke, the Telekom board chairman, announced that most of
the 40,000 eastern employees would be retained, but ``not all the
old bosses will be bosses tomorrow.'' He said pay would be raised
gradually to the level of western employees.
   Political tests and unequal pay await people in the East.
   ``We feel we will be second-class citizens,'' said Klaus Rieck
of Potsdam, who like other East Germans lived under dictators for
nearly 60 years, first Adolf Hitler and then the East German
Communists.
   ``We were under pressure the whole time - no freedom, no freedom
of speech or the press,'' he said. Now ``the joy is great, but the
uncertainty is, too.''
   Uncertainty and bad news about jobs are daily fare.
   Treuhandanstalt, the trustee agency trying to rescue formerly
state eastern enterprises, confirmed Thursday that the Pentacon
camera company would shut by year's end. It advised the management
to make its closing plans with social needs in mind.
   Fifteen regional managers have been chosen to decentralize the
agency's efforts. One of them, Peter Langner, said he would apply a
mixture of U.S., German and Japanese managerial methods to help
restructure about half of 600 to 1,000 enterprises in Leipzig.
   Langner, a physicist, said he helped found Nicolet Instrument, a
successful high-tech company in Madison, Wis., in 1968, and worked
as a director of the company in Europe until 1981.
   Recently, he has been a management consultant, concentrating on
East Germany's infant businesses, and believes the greatest
difficulty is an unwillingness to take responsibility.
   ``For 40 years, you have a country which was never trained to
make its own decisions,'' he said. ``Everything was told to them.''
   The trustee agency needs to act more quickly, he said, because
``decisions are more important than right or wrong.''

   The European Community's monetary
committee today approved a British plan to tie the pound into
Europe's exchange rate mechanism.
   Britain's decision on Friday reversed long-standing economic
policy and appeared to signal the government's willingness to play
an active role in efforts to shape an economic and monetary union
of the community nations.
   Hans Tietmeyer, a member of the board of the German central
bank, said the monetary and finance officials agreed to the British
proposal to peg the pound at 2.95 German marks in the exchange rate
mechanism.
   The pound will be allowed to swing up or down by 6 percent from
that central rate for an unspecified ``transitional period,'' he
said. The move is effective Monday.
   The decision was adopted unanimously by the committee of the 12
nations of the European Community trading bloc, said Michael
Somers, a represenative of Ireland's treasury.
   The exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System
seeks to prevent wide fluctuations in exchange rates and hold down
inflation and interest rates.
   With the pound's entry, the currencies of 10 of the community
nations will be tied to the arrangement. Only the Portuguese escudo
and the Greek drachma are apart.
   Western European countries intend to create a vast common market
without national barriers by 1993. They are also trying to form
closer political ties.
   The announcement Friday by British Chancellor of the Exchequer
John Major was coupled with word that Britain's base interest rate
will drop by one percentage point to 14 percent on Monday.
   The pound is joining the European exchange rate mechanism at a
high level, which the government hopes will ease Britain's 10.6
percent inflation rate. The country's switch from a free-floating
currency to a linked one is designed to promote economic stability
by limiting disruptive exchange rate movements.
   The pound and London's stock market rose sharply on the news
because joining the mechanism would set a stable floor under the
currency.
   Thatcher agreed in principle to link the pound to the other
currencies at a community summit meeting in Madrid last year, but
she said she would move only when Britain's inflation rate was
lower to the European average of 5.5 percent.
   Britain decided to go ahead because Britain's double-digit
inflation is expected to decline, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
said.
   The twin moves of entry into the 11-year-old mechanism and the
one-point interest rate cut are ``right for the times,'' the prime
minister said Friday.
   Opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock said it was correct
to cut interest rates and join the mechanism but that the moves
were ``action of cornered government.''
   Britain previously linked the pound to other currencies from
1944 to 1971 under a system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates.
It then participated in a rate movement-limiting European ``snake''
until 1973.
   The pound, which has risen sharply in recent months on
speculation that it would soon join the exchange rate mechanism,
soared to $1.9455 from $1.9185 before the announcement, and to
2.9933 marks from 2.9492 marks.
   London's Stock Exchange extended trading for an hour because of
the announcement. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index closed Friday at 2,143.9, up 73.5 points, or 3.6 percent,
from Thursday's close.

<HEAD>Reagan Back in the Saddle Again, Stumping for GOP Candidates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan is back on the GOP
campaign trail, appearing at fund-raisers from California to
Florida to raise millions of dollars for Republican candidates.
   The public relations fallout from the Iran-Contra scandal, a
lucrative Japanese tour, and Nancy Reagan's controversial book has
done nothing to dampen the demand for Reagan at luncheons, cocktail
parties and dinners.
   A Reagan appearance commands ticket prices of more than $1,500,
rivaling the dollar drawing power of events featuring Reagan's
successor, President Bush.
   ``There is just a great deal of affection out there for this
man,'' said Otto Bos, campaign director for California GOP
gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson. ``There's a recognition that
you're looking at one of the great lions of the century.''
   Wilson, locked in a tight race with Democrat Dianne Feinstein,
has benefited from five Reagan appearances, the most for any
candidate. Reagan plans to attend two more Wilson functions this
month, and more appearances are being considered.
   But Wilson isn't the only candidate Reagan has been stumping
for.
   Since February, Reagan has attended functions in Oregon,
Illinois, Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, Alabama, and Nevada, and has
appeared at Los Angeles-area events for candidates from Iowa and
Idaho.
   This month, the former president is likely to make appearances
for Republican candidates in Colorado, Indiana, Michigan and Texas,
his office said.
   ``President Reagan is continuing a pattern that has been his for
many, many years,'' said Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg. ``He did
not view the end of his presidency as retirement by any means.''
   Reagan isn't commanding his $30,000 or more speaking fee at
party events, but his partisan appearances sometimes come at cities
where he also is delivering a moneymaking speech.
   On Thursday, for example, Reagan popped into a $1,000-a-person
cocktail party fund-raiser for Nevada gubernatorial candidate Jim
Gallaway. He also was delivering a speech to the Mobil Oil Dealers
convention at the adjacent Las Vegas Convention Center.
   The California gubernatorial race, viewed with strong interest
by national Republicans, has been the focus of much of Reagan's
political attention. Reagan, a former California governor, has
appeared at events in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, San Diego, Fresno
and San Francisco.
   The party wants to ensure it has a strong voice in
reapportionment next year, when the governor and
Democratic-controlled Legislature draw districts for the nation's
largest congressional delegation.
   In addition to Reagan, the Wilson campaign has featured stump
appearances by Bush, Vice President Quayle and First Lady Barbara
Bush.
   The GOP strategy has been to lump Reagan's appearances for
Wilson in the beginning of the campaign and in the final stretch.
This was intended to give Wilson - who ran unopposed in the primary
- an early fund-raising push, then cash in on the late increase in
voter interest.
   ``Whether it's Ronald Reagan or Arnold Schwarzenegger, no matter
who the surrogate is, taking them out to an event in the middle of
July doesn't have the same kind of effect as later in the
campaign,'' said California GOP spokesman Dan Schnur.
   Democrats can't really match the appearances by Reagan and other
heavy hitters.
   ``I think Reagan's popularity rating is particularly high. I
don't think they'd be doing it if it wasn't,'' said Feinstein
spokesman Richard Martin. ``Democrats don't have the big guns right
now that the Republicans do. That definitely makes a difference.''

   Despite all the talk about an anti-incumbent
mood building among voters this election year, nearly 80 House
members and four senators are coasting to November with no major
party opposition.
   And those figures don't tell the full story of the diminishing
level of competition for seats in Congress.
   Half the 35 senators up for re-election are expected to
overwhelm little-known and underfinanced opponents.
   Of the 326 House members who have opponents, 217 were described
by Common Cause as ``financially unopposed.'' The self-styled
citizen's lobby said challengers to those 217 incumbents had raised
less than $25,000 each in campaign resources.
   The Associated Press tally of House races found 61 incumbents
with no opponents and 18 with only third-party opposition.
   Sens. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., David Pryor, D-Ark., and Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., have no opposition. The only opponent on the ballot to Sen.
John Warner, R-Va., is a follower of political extremist Lyndon
LaRouche.
   Several explanations, starting with the escalating cost of
campaigns, are offered for the decline in competition.
   ``We didn't have the money in the state of Georgia to finance a
campaign against Sam Nunn,'' said Carl Gillis, Republican National
Committeeman from Georgia. He estimated that a credible campaign
against the senator, who got 80 percent of the vote in 1984 and 83
percent in 1978, would cost between $3 million and $4 million and
still would be a long shot effort.
   In Virginia, Democratic Gov. L. Douglas Wilder discouraged his
party from challenging Warner on the theory that it would be a
waste of resources.
   ``Given the cost of mounting a campaign, if you don't have a
pretty good chance of winning, why do it,'' said political
scientist Gary Jacobson, an authority on congressional elections.
   ``You see the (re-election) record of incumbents, you see them
use their resources so effectively, and you hate to make a fool of
yourself running and getting absolutely wiped out,'' said Tom Mann,
a political scientist who heads the Congress project at Brookings
Institution.
   Mann suggested that the decline in competition did not signify a
growth in the strength of political parties. ``We have moved from
safe party seats to safe incumbent seats,'' said Mann.
   Two of the senators and several House members without major
party opposition are southern Republicans, a remarkable shift from
the days when the Democrats were dominant in the one-party South.
   In addition to Cochran and Warner, Republican Sens. Phil Gramm
of Texas and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina are expected to win
re-election by huge margins over Democratic opponents.
   In Thurmond's case, the lack of an opponent is all the more
remarkable given that he will turn 88 in December. The steady shift
of South Carolina to Republicanism is demonstrated by the fact that
Gov. Carroll Campbell also is favored to overwhelm his Democratic
opponent.
   ``The Southern habit of not contesting seats, transferred to the
Republicans,'' said Jacobson.
   The lack of competition for Senate seats this year is not
expected to be repeated in 1992.
   ``This is a fairly entrenched group of senators up in '90,''
said Anita Dunn, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee. ``I do not expect that in 1992 you will have a similar
number of relatively uncontested seats despite the fact that
everybody (incumbents) will be raising plenty of money for those
seats.''
   Of all the non-competitive races, none has provided more strange
twists than the GOP effort to challenge Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo
of New York.
   Cuomo is a potential challenger to President Bush in 1992 and
Republicans would have liked nothing better than to give him a hard
time in his bid for a third four-year term.
   But challenging Cuomo was a multimillion-dollar task that no
major party figure was willing to undertake.
   Enter economist Pierre Rinfret, who had to admit he wasn't even
certain he was a Republican. He got the nomination and then
discovered it didn't come with enough money to run a credible
campaign.
   Rinfret has since spent more time attacking Republican leaders
than tilting with Cuomo.
   ``They want me to lose because I'm going to upset their apple
cart,'' he said.
   ``We understand the guy's frustration,'' said state GOP chairman
J. Patrick Barrett. ``But he's saying, `I need a million dollars'
... and nobody's got the million dollars.''

   A world-class faculty and ``the nation's
choosiest admissions office'' made Harvard University the top large
school in a poll, and Amherst College was selected the best small
liberal arts college.
   U.S. News and World Report, in its annual survey, also selected
Juilliard School, Babson College and Harvey Mudd College as the
best specialty schools.
   Selected as top regional colleges and universities in its
special report on ``America's Best Colleges'' released in Monday's
editions of the magazine were Villanova University, Wake Forest
University, Illinois Wesleyan University and Trinity University.
   The country's oldest institution of higher learning, Harvard was
selected as the country's leading liberal arts university for the
first time since the survey began in 1983, although it had ranked
among the top five in the other years.
   The Cambridge, Mass., institution was chosen over 203 national
universities because of its ``a world-class faculty,'' its
cutting-edge research and its stringent admissions standards, the
magazine said.
   For last fall's freshman class, Harvard accepted about 18
percent of 12,843 applicants, the magazine said.
   Following Harvard as top national universities were Stanford,
Yale, Princeton, California Institute of Technology, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Duke, Dartmouth College, Cornell and
Columbia.
   Amherst College also was a first-time winner among America's 141
national liberal arts schools. The magazine touted its ``commitment
to academic flexibility and the intimacy of a small student body.''
Last year, Amherst accepted only 22 percent of the 4,504 students
who applied for the freshman class.
   The Amherst, Mass. school edged out Swarthmore and arch-rival
Williams College. Swarthmore was the winner the last two years.
   Bowdoin College ranked fourth, followed by Wellesley, Pomona,
Wesleyan University, Middlebury, Smith and Davidson.
   U.S. News ranked the 1,374 four-year colleges and universities
based on results of questionnaires from college presidents, deans
and admissions directors and the institutions' records in five key
areas, including reputation for academic excellence, financial
resources and ability to retain undergraduate and graduate
students.
   New York City's Juilliard School was ranked as the nation's
foremost music conservatory and the No. 1 arts school in the U.S.
News survey. The Rhode Island School of Design ranked second,
followed by the North Carolina School of the Arts.
   Babson College ranked top among the 24 business colleges in the
survey. Harvey Mudd College ranked first out of 18 engineering
schools.
   Topping the regional liberal arts colleges category were Simon's
Rock of Bard College in the north, Wofford College in the south,
Wittenberg University in the midwest and Southwestern University in
the west.
   Sixty percent of 4,131 college presidents, deans and admissions
directors responded to the questionnaire and also listed the
country's up-and-coming schools.
   Emory University topped the national universities category,
Rhodes College of Tennessee led the national liberal arts colleges
and, under regional colleges and universities, the University of
Hartford, George Mason University, University of St. Thomas, Minn.
and the University of Nevada at Las Vegas led.
   In a less flattering category, Brandeis University and
Bennington College were listed as the most expensive national
university and liberal arts college, respectively.

   Fighting raged Saturday in Rwanda's
countryside between government troops and invading rebels, and
foreigners fled the capital of the central African nation by the
hundreds.
   No further fighting was reported in the Rwandan capital of
Kigali, where French Foreign Legionnaires and Belgian paratroopers
secured their embassies, parts of the city, the airport and its
access highway.
   But fierce clashes were reported in the northern part of the
country and 500 soldiers from neighboring Zaire arrived in Kigali
to reinforce the 5,000-strong Rwandan army.
   The rebels, who call themselves the Rwandese Patriotic Front,
invaded last Sunday from Rwanda's northern neighbor, Uganda, where
they had been living in exile.They want to oust the government,
which they accuse of corruption.
   Many are deserters from the Ugandan army and most are members of
Rwanda's Tutsi ethnic minority, which was removed from power by the
majority Hutu tribe in the late 1950s and early 1960s in fighting
that left tens of thousands dead.
   Their number has never been reliably estimated.
   On Saturday, an Air France Boeing 747 carried 232 French and
other European nationals to Paris and another Air France plane and
a chartered Lufthansa jet were expected to pick up about 500 more
later in the day.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said measures were being taken to
``ensure the safety and the evacuation of the families of Soviet
personnel.'' It gave no further details and it was not known how
many people were involved.
   The German embassy in Nairobi said the Lufthansa plane would
bring mostly wives and children of German aid workers out of
Kigali.
   In Brussels, the Belgian government said it was withdrawing its
offer to place four C130 transport planes at the disposal of its
allies in the Persian Gulf because of the fighting in Rwanda.
   Belgium already has sent 500 paratroopers to Rwanda to protect
its 1,630 citizens living in the former Belgian protectorate.
   Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens said in Brussels Friday that
Belgian citizens who wanted to leave Rwanda could fly out on the
same planes that brought in the 300 troopers.
   Although Kigali appeared calm, the British Broadcasting
Corporation's African Service broadcast a message from the Foreign
Office urging British citizens to stay indoors.
   A dusk-to-dawn curfew announced Tuesday was extended round the
clock and a Belgian reporter in Kigali said some people confined to
their homes were running short of food.
   rrance has 670 citizens in Rwanda, Germany 400 and the United
States 250. Most are attached to embassies or engaged in foreign
aid projects.
   The exodus of foreigners was touched off by fighting in and
around the capital early Friday morning and fears that the conflict
could degenerate into more serious inter-ethnic violence.
   Diplomatic sources in Kigali reported sporadic gunfire Saturday,
but one said it appeared to be from nervous government soldiers.
   One Western diplomat said on condition of anonymity that Belgian
paratroopers were patrolling the capital's streets and guarding its
main hotel, the Meridien, where foreigners evacuated from the
countryside were being housed.
   Both the Belgian and French governments said their troops were
sent to Rwanda to protect their property and citizens and would not
get involved in the fighting. But the French army press service
said the legionnaires ``were obliged to ripost (fire defensively)''
at ``armed elements'' Friday morning.
   Rwanda's president, Juvenal Habyarimana, said in a nationwide
radio broadcast Friday government forces were ``in full control,''
but acknowledged that ``although the worst is over, the fighting
continues.''
   The rebels are led by Maj. Gen. Fred Rwigyema, a seasoned
Ugandan army officer of Rwandan descent. They accuse President
Habyarimana of abuse of power and corruption and say they want to
install a democratic government.
   The rebels also say they would like to end the refugee problem.
There are more than 100,000 Rwandan refugees in Africa and the
guerrillas give an estimate of 1 million worldwide.
   A main stumbling block to the refugees' repatriation has been
lack of space. Rwanda is Africa's most densely populated nation,
with an average of 566 people living per square mile.

   The federal government, its coffers dry, began
shutting down non-essential services today, closing the Washington
Monument and other favorite tourist spots but maintaining the
military and air traffic safety.
   Congressional leaders, arrived for a mid-morning meeting with
President Bush to discuss the budget crisis and found most of the
White House dark.
   Visitors to the Washington Monument and national symbols in the
nation's capital were turned away.
   Tourists were turned away from the Smithsonian's museums and art
galleries and the Library of Congress scheduled an early afternoon
closing.
   Guards at the White House gates directed baffled tourists to the
open-air Vietnam Veterans Memorial, suggesting it was the only one
of the dozens of government-run memorials and museums in the
nation's capital not locked up.
   White House tours were suspended.
   Non-essential White House employes, ranging from press
information officers to cooks, were told not to work along with
weekend federal workers across the country.
   The shutdown came at 12:01 a.m. Saturday when the government
lost its authority to spend money.
   These were the early casualties of a government shutdown that
could become devastatingly disruptive by Tuesday - after the
three-day Columbus Day weekend - if the budget impasse between
Congress and the White House isn't broken.
   That deadlock deepened as Bush said today he would veto a second
stop gap measure to extend the federal government's financial life
while negotiations continued.
   ``No more business as usual,'' said Bush as he left the meeting
with congressional leaders.
   ``Do not keep putting off the day of reckoning,'' he warned
Congress.
   An earlier continuing resolution had kept the government running
since last Sunday when congressional leaders and administration
negotiators first reached a compromise.
   But shutdown activities began after they failed to convince
enough members of Congress to go along with the compromise.
   Each agency decides what is an essential service. But,
generally, staying on the job will be workers dealing with national
security, health, emergency and other essential services. The
military, air traffic controllers, border guards, medical
institution personnel and prison guards also would be unaffected.
   NASA's much-delayed launch of the space shuttle Discovery also
took place despite the budget dispute. Officials at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration said the mission was
unaffected because the funds had already been set aside and
   If a budget agreement isn't reached by then, all but
``essential'' employees among the 2.4-million-member federal work
force will be told to go home within a few hours after reporting
for work.
   Budget director Richard Darman on Friday sent a memo to all
agency heads telling them to be ready to send home workers
scheduled to work today.
   Only essential employees, generally those needed to ``protect
life and property,'' will be permitted to work during the shutdown,
Darman said.
   An hour before the disruption, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters, ``At midnight tonight, our national parks
and monuments will close, cleanup of hazardous waste sites will
cease, Social Security offices will accept no new applications,
border inspections will be delayed.''
   The government has shut down for lack of spending authority
three times before, in 1981, 1984 and 1986, although never for more
than a day.
   The government's authority to spend money was to initially run
out on Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year, but President Bush
signed a stopgap five-day extension to give Congress a chance to
begin working on a $500 billion, five-year deficit-reduction
package he and congressional leaders crafted.
   But the House rejected the plan early Friday and Bush refused to
go along with another short-term government spending bill.
   The shutdown was hitting home at the White House, where aides
said daily public tours would be suspended.
   Deputy press secretary Stephen Hart said a scheduled Monday
reception in the East Room for incoming Supreme Court justice David
H. Souter, would also be canceled. And Hart said he and other
presidential spokesmen would be sent home.
   Manny Strumpf, National Park Service spokesman in New York City,
said the staffs at both Liberty Island and Ellis Island have been
told to report to work. But administration officials in Washington
said that they likely will be sent home in the absence of a budget
deal.
   The Park Service is prepared to ``padlock everything that can be
padlocked,'' said Interior Department spokesman Bob Walker.
   ``If a visitor wants to drive into Yellowstone or Shenandoah
Park, there'll be no one there to keep them out - or charge them a
toll to get in. But those people would be largely on their own,''
Walker said. ``If their car broke down, there would be no friendly
ranger to help them.''
   A Federal Aviation Administration spokesman, Bob Buckhorn, said
that ``if we have a shutdown, essential services remain in place,''
including air traffic control. However, if the deadlock persists,
there would be a reduction in the number of controllers allowed to
work.
   At the Agriculture Department, employees who normally work on
weekends - primarily Forest Service workers - were told to be
prepared to go home today.
   Kelly Shipp, a department spokeswoman, said that only a handful
of the 100,000 USDA employees nationwide would be considered
essential and expected to report to work during a shutdown.
   State and county offices of major USDA agencies, such as the
Farmers Home Administration and the Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service, would close.
   Federal meat and poultry inspection, however, would continue
during a general shutdown, Shipp said.
   The Defense Department has more than 3 million employees,
including 2.1 million uniformed personnel. But it appeared unlikely
that any curtailment of Pentagon operations would affect the
deployment of more than 170,000 servicemen and women in the Persian
Gulf.
   At the State Department, officials said all employees are
expected to show up Tuesday but that non-essential workers would be
sent home.
   The Postal Service is not affected because it is nt dependent
on government appropriations. And there was no immediate impact on
Amtrak, although the passenger railroad receives a large government
subsidy and its operations would be hard hit if the budget impasse
is long lasting.
   Joan Baran, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Customs Service in New
York said customs agents are considered essential and would work
this weekend.
   ``Everything will be business as usual,'' she said.
   If the president fails to sign a continuing resolution by
Tuesday, then non-essential employees, mostly clerical workers,
could be sent home, Baran said.
   ``Nobody likes to be told they're non-essential,'' she said.

   Kuwait's exiled rulers have invited
450 prominent citizens of their occupied land to discuss a new type
of Kuwait for when Iraq eventually retreats, the emirate's Crown
Prince Sheik Saad said Saturday.
   In the meantime, he said, Kuwait refuses to consider any
negotiated compromise that does not involve Iraq's unconditional
withdrawal from all Kuwaiti territory seized on Aug. 2.
   Saad said Kuwaiti notables will meet in Jiddah Oct. 13 for three
days to discuss the situation and make plans for the future.
   ``We have this question in our minds, how to rebuild a new
Kuwait,'' he said in an interview. ``It will not be easy. We'll
have to work very hard.''
   Saad, whose full name is Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, is
crown prince and prime minister of Kuwait. He is a cousin of the
emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah.
   Although he was reluctant to elaborate, Saad made it clear the
meeting would look at everything from defense arrangements to the
basic rights of Kuwaiti citizens and foreign residents.
   ``After the invasion, we learned many things as Kuwaitis,'' he
said. ``We'll have a new policy for security in the future, closer
cooperation with our brothers in the gulf and with our friends.''
   Asked about Kuwait's dependence on foreign workers, with few
rights or little attachment to the wealthy state, he said, ``We
will talk about all of these things.''
   Invitations have been sent to exiled Kuwaitis, including present
or past members of the elected legislature, senior diplomats,
businessmen, judges, civil servants, journalists, students and
others.
   Delegates will arrive from London, Paris and Middle Eastern
capitals, Saad said.
   He declined to speak about the Kuwaiti resistance movement or
the situation of royal family members still in the occupied
emirate.
   But Kuwaiti sources said later the government-in-exile had
tacitly agreed not to press ahead with armed resistance against the
Iraqis to avoid massive reprisals.
   Saad described continuing human rights abuses and massive
destruction by Iraqis in Kuwait. He said many Kuwaiti men have been
taken to Iraq. Some were killed, and women and children have been
tortured, he said.
   ``The damage is very much, you can't believe it,'' he said. ``I
feel very sad.''
   Saad was asked about suggestions that Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein might be prepared to withdraw from most of Kuwait while
holding onto an oil-rich strip along the border, and the islands of
Bubiyan and Warbah, which control Iraq's outlets to the gulf.
   ``We don't accept any sort of formula or suggestion less than
the U.N. Security Council resolutions,'' which call for
unconditional Iraqi withdrawal and restoration of the royal
al-Sabah family, he said.
   Asked if Kuwait would maintain that position if the crisis
dragged on for months or years, he said: ``Yes, we would stick to
it.''
   Aides to the crown prince said the exiled government not only
has access to considerable financial hldings abroad, but also
expects to collect reparations from Iraq's seized assets abroad.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait only five hours after Saad returned from
talks with senior Baghdad officials in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia. He had
gone there to discuss Saddam's claims over border areas and
allegations that Kuwait had stolen oil worth $2.4 billion from
oilfields along Iraq's southern frontier.
   Asked if he thought at the time Iraq would invade, he said:
``No, never.''
   Kuwait's displaced rulers are ensconced at the al-Hada Sheraton,
perched dramatically on a mountaintop at Taif, the Saudi royal
family's summer retreat east of Jiddah.
   Princes, Cabinet ministers and officials while away their days
in the seven-story hotel, contemplating lush gardens, sipping
coffee and fruit juice and gathering at meal times for sumptuous
spreads.
   Asked if he planned to move from the Sheraton, Saad said: ``Yes.
I will move to Kuwait.''

   Bush said he still strongly supports the $500 billion, five-year
deficit cutting package that the House rejected in a post-midnight
vote Thursday night.
   He spoke disparagingly of members of Congress who were opposed
to individual items in the plan, mentioning unnamed committee
chairmen whom he said complained ``my little empire's being
invaded.''
   The Democratic-controlled House was scheduled to convene at
midafternoon and a vote was expected on overriding Bush's veto of
the stopgap spending bill. But the veto seemed secure, as Senate
GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas said there were enough votes in the
Senate to sustain it.
   The House vote on the stopgap measure had been 300-113, and the
Senate added voice-vote approval.
   Bush said he thought a short-term solution could emerge by later
in the day, and Dole said Bush was prepared to sign a spending bill
that would avert the shutdown of government services as long as it
incorporated an estimated $41 billion in across-the-board spending
cuts.
   The full force of the shutdown in non-essential services was not
expected to be felt until Tuesday, after the Columbus Day holiday
for government workers.

   Navy Capt. Dick Richards,
Discovery's commander, is traveling into space for the second time
in a little more than a year.
   The former test pilot made his first shuttle flight August 1989
on a secret Defense Department mission.
   Richards, 44, said before the flight that he believed a
successful mission would help people forget about NASA's recent
troubles, which include hydrogen leaks aboard the Atlantis and
Columbia space shuttles.
   ``Right now, we don't look so good,'' he said.
   But he denied that NASA's recent misfortunes have put additional
pressure on his crew or the launch team at Cape Canaveral, Fla., to
get a space shuttle into orbit.
   ``They treat us like we're fragile commodities down there,'' he
said, adding he believes the space agency has been quite
conservative in handling mechanical problems in the post-Challenger
era.
   Richards was born in Key West, Fla., but grew up in St. Louis
where he graduated from Riverview Gardens High School. He earned a
bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of
Missouri and a master's degree in aeronautical systems from the
University of West Florida.
   After earning his bachelor's degree, he joined the Navy. He
became a naval aviator and later went to the U.S. Navy test pilot
school.
   Richards served as a project test pilot for development work on
automatic carrier landing systems for F-4 and A-7 aircraft.
   He was on his way to an assignment with a fighter squadron when
he learned he had been selected as an astronaut candidate in 1980.
   Richards is married. His flight experience includes more than
4,000 hours in 16 different kinds of airplanes.

   Marine Lt. Col. Robert Cabana is
making his first trip into space as the pilot aboard Discovery.
   The 41-year-old astronaut said before the launch that he was
looking forward to his first trip into space, calling it ``the
culmination of a lot of years of work on my part.''
   Cabana is quick to defend NASA, attributing the recent rash of
problems to mere coincidence, not carelessness.
   ``I think NASA is going to come through this and do just fine.
... I haven't seen any complacency at all,'' Cabana said. ``There's
no push to do anything unsafely.''
   Cabana was born in Minneapolis where he graduated from Washburn
High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the
Naval Academy.
   He also graduated from the Navy test pilot school and later
served as a test pilot for flight systems and ordnance separation
testing on aircraft.
   NASA selected him as an astronaut in 1986. He and his wife have
three children.
   When the Discovery mission ends, Cabana said he plans to get
back in line and wait for another flight assignment. He hopes to
command his own shuttle mission.
   ``I want to stay here and fly shuttles as long as they let me,''
he said.

   Navy Capt. Bill Shepherd, a veteran
of a previous shuttle mission, is the flight engineer aboard
Discovery.
   Shepherd, 41, first flew into space aboard Atlantis on a secret
Defense Department mission in December 1988. He was a mission
specialist on that flight.
   On this mission, Shepherd is taking on the additional role of
flight engineer, who assists the commander and pilot during takeoff
and landing.
   Shepherd was born in Oak Ridge, Tenn. He graduated from Arcadia
High School in Scottsdale, Ariz., and earned a bachelor's degree in
aerospace engineering from the Naval Academy.
   He also attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
where he earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering.
   After graduating from the Naval Academy, he served with an
underwater demolition team and two SEAL teams. Shepherd, who's
single, was selected as an astronaut in 1984.

   Discovery mission specialist Bruce
E. Melnick is the first astronaut selected from the U.S. Coast
Guard.
   Melnick, a Coast Guard commander, is one of two Discovery
astronauts designated to perform a spacewalk during the mission
should an emergency arise.
   Melnick said he first wanted to be an astronaut as a youth when
he watched Alan Shepherd become the first American to fly in space.
   ``But I didn't think it was a realistic goal,'' Melnick said.
   Melnick was born in New York City, but he grew up in Clearwater,
Fla., where he graduated from Clearwater High School.
   He worked on fishing boats in Florida and became interested in
the Coast Guard planes he saw flying in the area. Being a Coast
Guard pilot, he said, seemed a more realistic goal - ``so that's
the direction I took.''
   After earning a bachelor's degree in engineering from the Coast
Guard Academy, he was assigned as a deck watch officer aboard a
cutter. Sixteen months later, he went to Navy flight training.
   He earned his wings in 1974 and a master's degree in
aeronautical systems from the University of West Florida a year
later. He worked as a Coast Guard rescue pilot and an operations
officer before being selected as an astronaut.
   Melnick is married and has two children.

   Air Force Maj. Tom Akers, who is
making his first trip into space, was assigned to deploy the
plutonium-powered Ulysses sun probe during the mission.
   He also is one of the crew members trained to do a spacewalk if
necessary.
   Akers was born in St. Louis but considers Eminence, Mo., his
hometown. He was the 1969 high school valedictorian from Eminence
High School.
   He earned a bachelor's and master's degree in applied
mathematics from the University of Missouri-Rolla.
   Akers worked as a National Park Ranger at Alley Springs, Mo.,
during the summers from 1972 through 1975. He also spent four years
as a high school principal in Eminence.
   He joined the Air Force in 1979 and attended the Air Force Test
Pilot School three years later.
   Akers, married and with two children, was serving as the
executive officer to the armament division's deputy commander for
research, development and acquisition when selected as an astronaut
in 1987.

<HEAD>No Sign of Nessie in First Day of Monster Hunt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pouring rain and a thick mist
Saturday failed to dampen the enthusiasm of hunters hoping to win a
half-million-dollar reward in the first major search for the Loch
Ness monster in three years.
   But there was no immediate sign of the legendary beast.
   National oddsmakers at the William Hill Organization Ltd. have
put up the cash - 250,000 pounds, or $477,500 - for the first
person or team to discover ``conclusive evidence'' of the
creature's existence.
   Based at the village of Drumnadrochit near the northern shore of
the loch - or lake - in the Scottish Highlands, four groups are
taking art in the two-day search. They range from serious
contestants to publicity seekers.
   William Hill has offered an additional $2,865 prize for the best
search method.
   Daniel Isted, the 25-year-old London-based editor of a corporate
in-house magazine, said he was using what he called ``crystal
divination.'' He said a tourmaline crystal, suspended from a yacht
over the inky waters, would swing to indicate Nessie's direction.
   Former rock singer Screaming Lord Sutch, head of a political
group called the Monster Raving Loony Party, said his secret weapon
was a whistle that produces the mating call of monsters.
   Tongue in cheek, he announced he would use haggis - a Scottish
delicacy consisting of chopped entrails and oatmeal cooked in the
lining of a sheep's stomach - as bait to lure the creature to the
surface.
   The Raving Loony Party, created to poke fun at politicians, runs
candidates in most elections.
   Andy Gray, 38-year-old managing director of a Scottish company
that supplies underwater sonar equipment for the North Sea oil
industry, is taking a more scientific approach with a sophisticated
underwater radar.
   ``Typically this system can work 3,280 feet beneath the sea. If
Nessie comes within our search scan we will find it.''
   Loch Ness is 754 feet deep, 23 miles long and a mile wide.
   Iain Bishop, deputy keeper of the zoology department of the
Natural History Museum in London, will examine any evidence found
on behalf of the oddsmakers.
   Standing in the pouring rain and looking out at the mist-covered
lake, he acknowledged some skepticism.
   ``I don't expect to be overwhelmed by it (evidence),'' Bishop
said.
   Locals, who have seen it all before, picked their way through
the army of news people and television crews from the United
States, Japan, France, Britain and elsewhere that have invaded the
village.
   The legend of the Loch Ness Monster dates from A.D. 565 when St.
Columba castigated the creature for attacking a follower.
   In modern times there have been more than 4,000 reported
sightings, including the October 1987 sighting that spawned the
last major hunt.
   That search, Operation Deepscan, used sonars and reported
detecting what was called a large ``fish-like arch'' at a depth of
450 feet on the southern end of the lake.
   Deepscan spokesman Guy Pearse said then the object registered as
a clear, large blip on the sonar but when the same boat scanned the
area again the object had disappeared.
   Skeptics have explained away the sightings as everything from
waves, logs and rotting vegetation to otters, swimming deer and
overindulgence in Scottish whisky.
   A study by a Scottish company, Mackay Consultants, printed in
The Times of London in May, said the Loch Ness Monster was worth
$47 million a year in tourist revenue and responsible for 2,500
tourist industry jobs.
   It said half a million visitors a year from all over the world
come to Loch Ness in hopes of seeing the fabled creature.

   A man who appeared on ABC's ``20-20'' claiming he
played Buckwheat in the classic ``Our Gang'' comedies was an
impostor, the actor who played Spanky said.
   The child actor who portrayed Buckwheat died nearly a decade ago
at age 49, George ``Spanky'' McFarland said.
   A ``20-20'' news magazine segment narrarated by Hugh Downs
reported Friday that an elderly man who portrayed Buckwheat in the
Hal Roach film comedies was found working as a grocery bagger in
Tempe, Ariz.
   The man, who identified himself as Bill English, said he had
changed his name from Bill Thomas.
   The real Buckwheat, whose name was William ``Billy'' Thomas,
died nearly 10 years ago, McFarland said.
   ``I don't have the slightest idea who he was, but he wasn't
Buckwheat,'' said McFarland, 62, who watched the ``20-20'' program.
   McFarland said from his Fort Worth home that he last saw the
real Buckwheat at an ``Our Gang'' reunion in Los Angeles in 1980,
shortly before Thomas died of a heart attack.
   Richard W. Bann, who co-wrote a 1976 book on the ``Our Gang''
stars, also said the real Buckwheat is dead.
   ``Buckwheat ain't giving no more interviews,'' said Bann, who
watched the show in Los Angeles.
   ``20-20'' spokeswoman Maurie Perl said the show thought it had
the right Buckwheat. ``We did our research, and to the best of our
knowledge, we're not aware that he passed away,'' she said.
   The man claiming to be Buckwheat could not immediately be
reached for comment. There was only one William English listed in
the Tempe-area phone directories, and a person who answered that
number said it wasn't the same one.
   According to the book ``Our Gang, the Life and Times of the
Little Rascals,'' by Bann and film critic Leonard Maltin, William
``Billy'' Thomas appeared in 89 ``Our Gang'' films from 1934 until
the series ended in 1944.
   The ``Our Gang'' series, which included 221 short films and one
of feature length, began in 1922 with the billing: ``Hal Roach
presents his Rascals in their latest Our Gang comedy titled ...''
   The term ``Little'' was added to ``Rascals'' when the films were
broadcast on television beginning in 1955.
   A number of well-known actors starred in the shows over the
years, including Robert Blake and Jackie Cooper.

<HEAD>Investigators Examine Documents For Evidence Against Stasi Chief</HEAD>

   Investigators have begun examining
documents in Berlin that could be used as evidence against Erich
Mielke, the jailed chief of East Germany's Stasi secret police,
officials said Saturday.
   Three days after the fanfare of unification, the Stasi legacy
resurfaced as a serious and possibly troubling issue for the new
German nation.
   Earlier Saturday, a newspaper reported that lawmakers from
former West Germany want to bar rrom a united Parliament any
newcomers from East Germany who had Stasi links.
   In Berlin, protesters outside the former Stasi headquarters were
surprised late Friday when strangers showed up and said they were
from the Bundeskriminalamt, a sort of German FBI.
   The protesters have been demanding that only citizens of former
East Germany have access to the highly sensitive files, and
immediately denounced the investigators' actions.
   Rolf Hannich, spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's Office in
Karlsruhe, confirmed that investigators were at the complex to look
for evidence.
   But he insisted the action was not violating an agreement
strictly limiting access to 6 million Stasi files and keeping them
under East German control.
   He said investigators were examining documents that could be
used against Mielke and other former secret police officials.
   Those documents had been made available by East German officials
before unification and the investigators wanted to have another
look at them, said Hannich.
   Earlier, the ADN news agency said federal law officials plan to
comb through the former Stasi secret police headquarters in search
of evidence.
   Mielke is suspected of harboring Palestinian and leftist German
terrorists and faces a host of other accusations as well.
   Federal law officials aren't the only ones interested in what's
inside the Stasi files.
   The newspaper Bild am Sonntag said western lawmakers want to
have a look at the files after Dec. 2 elections to make sure
parliamentary newcomers from the east aren't tainted by a Stasi
past.
   It quoted Juergen Ruettgers, a top parliamentarian from
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition, as saying: ``Without a doubt we
will want to know after parliamentary elections whether new members
were Stasi workers.''
   ``The Bundestag (Parliament) must not be occupied by former
spies,'' Wilfried Penner, a top Social Democrat, was quoted as
saying.
   Western lawmakers want to establish a committee that would
investigate the pasts of new parliamentarians from the east, the
newspaper said in a telex sent to other news organizations in
advance of Sunday's publication.
   Penner said such a committee should be permitted to examine the
Stasi files, which are potentially explosive because of the damage
they could do to political careers and to private lives if their
contents were made public.
   During one of the last sessions of the Volkskammer, East
Germany's parliament, a number of members confessed they once had
Stasi links.
   The Stasi secret police snooped on all facets of East German
life in order to maintain the Communist rulers' iron grip on the
now-dissolved nation.

   A twin-engine plane carrying five
Americans nose-dived into a farm on Brazil's northeastern coast,
killing all aboard, officials said Saturday.
   Among the Americans killed was a Navy officer, officials said.
   The privately owned Cessna plane crashed Friday afternoon in the
rural town of Itamaraju in Bahia state, 580 miles northeast of Rio,
police Inspector Ana Maria de Jesus Cesar said by telephone.
   Ms. Cesar said the plane took off from Rio de Janeiro shortly
after noon Friday under clouy skies and drizzle for an 80-minute
flight to the beach resort of Porto Seguro, 600 miles northeast of
Rio.
   As the craft went into its descent, it wavered and abruptly
nose-dived into a clearing of a ranch owned by the local mayor, she
said.
   ``There was no explosion, but the craft hit with such impact
that the nose of the plane was completely buried in the ground when
we found it,'' Ms. Cesar said.
   All five aboard were killed on impact, she said.
   Though the precise cause of the accident was not known, Cesar
said the plane's engine apparently ``suffered problems of a
technical nature.''
   The victims were identified as Navy Lt. Daniel T. Humphreys,
David Norbert Michalak, Joseph Francis Bonacci, Timothy T. Pohlman
and Mark L. Evans, said David Wagner, public affairs officer at the
U.S. consulate in Rio.
   Wagner said Michalak was 28 years old but had no ages for the
other victims. Their hometowns also were not yet available, he
said.
   He said the victims were headed for a weekend holiday in Porto
Seguro.
   Humphreys was in Rio on a Navy exchange program. Bonacci, the
plane's owner, and Pohlman, who was flying the plane when it
crashed, were Rio residents, Wagner said.
   Evans, formerly an employee of the Boeing Co., and Michalak, an
employee of General Electric Co. in the United States, were in Rio
on vacation, he said.

   Young people set pools of gasoline ablaze in
the street and hurled rocks at riot police in Japan's largest slum
Saturday night in demonstrations touched off by charges of police
corruption.
   Huge piles of burned bicycles, broken glass and hulks of
burned-out cars littered the streets in the Nishinari district of
Osaka, the country's No. 2 city.
   Police said 171 people, including 134 police, have been injured
in the violence since it began Tuesday, when a police sergeant was
reported to have received bribes from gangsters active in the
neighborhood. Fifty-seven people have been arrested, they said.
   The scope of the violence is extremely unusual for Japan, where
public issues rarely inflame passions to such a degree.
   About 2,500 riot police in thick padded uniforms and blue
helmets formed a barricade with metal shields near the Nishinari
police station to keep the crowd of about 1,100 from approaching.
   Four vehicles equipped with water cannons guarded the station's
main entrance and regularly sprayed the crowd. Every few minutes,
groups of young people dashed toward the riot police, yelling
insults and pounding the troopers with stones.
   Some poured pools of gasoline over the street and lit it, but
the blazes were quickly extinguished by the water cannons. Another
group broke into a nearby hotel and attempted to set it on fire,
but that blaze also was put out by the water cannons.
   After midnight, the crowd began thinning, police said.
   ``I think the crowd is getting tired,'' a police official said
on condition of anonymity. ``But we will continue to keep 2,500
riot police here just in case.''
   Earlier last week, after the arrest of a local policeman on
suspicion of having taken $81,000 in bribes from gangsters, most
people involved in the nightly violence were day laborers from the
neighborhood.
   News reports said the arrested policeman had confessed he
accepted the bribes in exchange for providing information about
police operations against the gangsters, who control the allocation
of some jobs to the day laborers and receive a percentage of their
wages in return.
   Many in the crowd Saturday were hooligans and students from
outside the neighborhood, police said.
   The rioting has not spread beyond the neighborhood, but has
caused traffic tie-ups in parts of Osaka as police blocked off
several major streets.
   The area, nicknamed the ``Airin'' district by locals, is Japan's
largest slum and is notorious for gangs, transient laborers and
shabby hotels.
   Local residents and human rights activists have complained about
police anti-crime measures, including 24-hour surveillance cameras
on street corners.
   Menial laborers in the area have previously demonstrated against
low wages and other issues, but the level of last week's violence
was unusual.

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's press
conference Saturday with reporters in front of the White House.
   President Bush: Well, I just want to comment. I know the leaders
have been speaking, and I have not yet signed, but within the next
couple of minutes will veto the continuing resolution.
   We've had good cooperation from Democrat and Republican leaders,
and the Congress has got to get on with the people's business, and
that - I'd like them to do that business, get a budget resolution
and get it done in the next 24 hours or 48 hours.
   But, as president, I cannot let the people's business be
postponed over and over again. I've jotted down the numbers. There
have been three dozen in the last decade, three dozen continuing
resolutions - business as usual, and we can't have it. And the
president can only do this one thing - send that message back and
say this is not a time for business as usual. The deficit is too
important to the American people.
   So I expressed my appreciation to the speaker, the majority
leader in the Senate, the majority leader in the House, two
Republican leaders, thanked them for coming together in a spirit of
compromise to get an agreement that I strongly supported. Didn't
have everything I wanted in there, but now I'm calling on those who
did not vote for it on the Republican side and on the Democratic
side to get up with the leadership and send down something that
will take care of the people's business once and for all.
   And I am sorry that I have to do this, but I made very clear
that I am not going to be a part of business as usual when we have
one deficit after another piling up. And I've had enough of it, and
I think the American people have had enough of it.
   Q: Mr. President, Mr. Mitchell came out here just a minute ago
and said that this serves no useful purpose, the shutting, what
useful purpose ...?
   A: That's where we have a disagreement with him. I think it
serves, I think it disciplines the United States Congress,
Democrats and Republicans. They're the ones that have to pass this
budget, and they ought to get on with it. And the leaders, to their
credit, tried. But a lot of members think they can get a free shot,
right and left.
   And, that, what this message says is no more business as usual.
So we did have a difference on that particular point. I think both
the speaker and the majority leader did not want me to do this. But
look, let me take you guys back awhile. In August, I wanted to keep
the Congress in. That story was written. And I listened to the
leadership, both Republicans and Democrats. So I said, ``No, we'll
acquiesce.'' Because they said to keep the Congress here in August
will be counterproductive. Everybody will be angry with you. That
the way to get it done is with the discipline of the calendar
running after the summer recess.
   And so I acquiesced. I compromised. I gave. I'm not going to do
it any more. I'm very sorry if people are inconvenienced, but I am
not going to be a part of business as usual by the United States
Congress.
   Q: Mr. President, Senator Dole said that you had agreed to sign,
to send up a new short-term spending bill that would include
spending cuts, a sequester. Could you tell us something about that?
   A: Well, I'm going to stay out of exactly what we're going to do
and let the leaders handle the details of this now. It's in the
Congress and we will strong, I still strongly support the agreement
that both Democrat leaders and Republicans leaders came down on.
   And I'll say this, I do think that there's a lot of agreement,
goodwill still existing for that. It's not going to be passed
exactly that way. It was defeated, but let's leave the details of
negotiation on that to the Congress. They're starting back in right
now. They're going to have to contend with this veto I sent up, and
obviously I want to see that veto sustained.

<HEAD>WASHN: veto sustained.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: You say no more business as usual, in one breath you say no
more CRs (continuing resolutions), but in the next breath Dole says
you'll sign a CR with a sequestration.
   A: Well, if the, well, if it has some discipline. What I'm
saying is I want to see this system disciplined. If it has, if it,
what Bob Dole said is correct, I'll sign one, if it puts some
discipline on the system. And if it doesn't discipline the system,
then I stay with my current position. No, excuse me, I'm glad you
brought that up, because I would strongly support that.
   Q: The leadership made a strong point in saying that it's the
average Americans who are going to be hurt, federal workers and so
on, it's not congressmen. But, you know, average Americans who are
going to be strongly hurt by this.
   A: The average American is smart. The average American knows
what's going on, I think. And I think they know that the Congress
has continued to kick this can down the road, and they think they
ought to act. And I'm very sorry for people that are inconvenienced
by this or hurt by this, but this is the only, only device one has
for making something happen. And that is to get the Congress to
act, to do its business.
   Q: Mr. President, you seem to be blaming Congress but in fact a
lot of their constituents are the ones that urged them to vote
against it. They say it's unfair, the burden is unfairly divided,
that the poor and the middle class are paying too much. Is it
possible that maybe this program that you propose with the leaders
just was not acceptable to the American public?
   A: Well, certainly certain aspects of it might well not have
been acceptable to the American public on both the right or the
left. But when you're trying to do the country's business, I've
discovered you have to compromise from time to time. And that's
exactly what I did, took a few shots in the process, but it doesn't
matter. What matters is let's move this process ahead now.
   But, yeah, you're right. Some people didn't like one aspect or
another. We had Republicans jumping up on the side, of our side of
the aisle and said, ``Well, I'll vote for it if you change this, or
I don't like this part of it but if you change that.'' And
similarly you've got people that you were quoting that were on the
other side. So, but at times, one has to come together to do the
country's business for the overall good. And these outrageous
deficits cannot be permitted to go on, and on, and on, and on. And
I'm worried about international markets, I'm worried about this
country to be - the opinion that it can't take care of its fiscal
business.
   And to their leaders' credit, Democratic and Republican. They
tried very hard and they failed to get a majority on the Democratic
side, and the Republican leaders, with the help from this
president, all I could bring to bear on it, we failed. Because we
had people who were looking at one narrow part of the package and
not at the overall good. And I am hopeful now, that with the
urgency this veto brings to bear on the situation, that reasonable
people, men and women in the Congress, can come together.
   Q: Mr. President, what kind of progress is being made on a new
budget resolution? And, sources on the Hill are saying that there
is glowing support for raising the tax rates of the wealthy in
exchange, perhaps, for the cuts on premiums for Medicare. But
you've opposed that in the past. Are you willing to give on tax
rates for the wealthy?
   A: I am, I don't know the answer to your question. They're just
going back up now to try. I like the parameters of the other deal,
wherein I compromised. We've got people - your question reflects
the views of those on the more liberal or left side of the
political spectrum who raise those questions. We have some on the
right side of the political spectrum coming at the process from
another way.
   Now I say let them go up and negotiate. This is the business of
the Congress, and our people will stay in touch. I won't mislead
them. If there's something that's so outrageous I can't accept it,
I'll let them know at the beginning so they don't waste their time.
But we're flexible. I've already compromised. And I'm not saying
that I can't take a look at new proposals, but you've got to put
together a majority in the Congress. And that's where the leaders
are having great difficulties.

   The trials are over, but the split decisions in two climactic
obscenity cases makes it certain that the controversy over the
bounds of artistic expression will continue.
   ``It doesn't start the war; it doesn't end the war. It's just
another battle,'' Donald Wildmon, founder of the conservative
American Family Association, said after a jury exonerated an art
gallery and its director of obscenity charges.
   Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis
Barrie, were found innocent Friday of the charges stemming from
their display of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe's work. It was
the nation's first obscenity trial for an art gallery and its
director.
   On Wednesday, however, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., jury convicted
record store owner Charles Freeman of obscenity for selling a
sexually explicit record by the rap group 2 Live Crew. Freeman
could face a year in jail.
   Standards have changed markedly since Elvis Presley was
televised from the waist up to avoid showing TV viewers his
wriggling hips, and Hollywood cringed over Clark Gable ending
``Gone With the Wind'' with, ``Frankly, my dear, I don't give a
damn.''
   Such instances appear tame now, compared with 2 Live Crew's
graphic raps on the album ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be.'' On such
songs as ``Me So Horny,'' the Florida group describes exactly how
they would mistreat women to satisfy their desires.
   Similarly, one photograph in the late Mapplethorpe's exhibit
showed one man urinating in another man's mouth. Three photos
showed penetration of man's anus with various objects and two show
children with their genitals exposed.
   To some, that's trash. To others, it's art.
   ``Sophie's Choice'' author William Styron calls the obscenity
battle ``uncalled-for. It's a violent exhibition of the kind of
puritanism that is still the governing spirit in many ways in this
country.
   ``I don't like anything that puts a damper on artistic
expression.''
   But Wildmon said the Americans' common sense is simply coming to
the fore, spurred by an outbreak of permissiveness in the arts.
   ``Eight or 10 years ago, the average American was not confronted
with this,'' Wildmon said. ``More Americans are being confronted
with this and they don't like it. More than that, their children
are being confronted with this and they don't like that.''
   Inspired by the Mapplethorpe trial, the Brooklyn Museum in New
York City has put together an exhibit showing several centuries of
objectionable art. The point is to show that what's considered art
or obscenity frequently changes over the years, said curator
Charlotte Kotik.
   Among the artwork on display are Rodin's bronzes of lesbians
embracing, 19th century paintings of nude children and an 18th
century Hindu painting of a man urinating into another man's mouth.
   Like Wildmon, Kotik can see the nation's conservative drift over
the last decade. The difference is, she disagrees with it, and
worries that more art might fall victim.
   ``It starts with small things and can unfortunately turn into a
big issue,'' she said. ``What we are trying to say is, `Wait a
minute. Stop and think about what we are doing before it goes too
far.' ''
   2 Live Crew's legal troubles are continuing even as their music
may be becoming pass.
   Leader Luther Campbell and two other band members are to go on
trial this week in Miami on charges of performing obscene material
at a nightclub. The group also canceled shows on its current tour
because of lagging ticket sales.
   Meantime, along come the Geto Boys.
   Members of this Texas rap group brag they make 2 Live Crew sound
like ``choir boys.'' They lace their sexually explicit raps with
extreme violence and misogyny. Last month, giant Geffen Records
announced it would no longer distribute the Geto Boys' record
label, Def American.
   ``I'm an editor of a rap music magazine and I have trouble with
the Geto Boys,'' said Jon Shecter, editor of The Source. ``I
support everyone's right to say what they want, but the Geto Boys
are in another league.''
   Shecter said such bands as the Geto Boys and others who send him
clippings of their arrests seem interested in obscenity for the
sake of attention, not art.
   Florida lawyer Jack Thompson, who's crusaded against 2 Live
Crew, warned the record industry in a pointed Billboard essay that
if they don't see that acts clean up their lyrics, courts will do
the job.
   ``Life imitates art and art imitates life,'' Thompson said. ``We
need to enforce laws against the people who are calculatingly going
after the almighty dollar at the expense of women and children.''

   A: One follow-up and then we'll come over here.
   Q: Following up on that, members of your own party dislike the
deal so much, how could you and your advisers have misjudged the
sentiments of members of your own party?
   A: Because it's easy when you don't have to be responsible for
something. It's easy to get up and say, ``Hey, I've got an election
in three weeks and I'm going to stay up against this particular
package, Medicare, the tax on the home heating oil, or the fact
there's not enough growth or not enough incentive.'' Any individual
member can do that. And maybe it plays well at home. The president
and the leadership in both houses have to be responsible for the
overall good of the country, have to make something happen.
   I can't get it done just my way. I don't control both houses of
Congress. I'd love to think that that luxury would come my way
someday, but it hasn't. And therefore we've had to compromise. So I
will keep trying in that spirit, that cooperative, positive spirit.
But when it comes to the discipline that comes from saying, ``I'm
sorry, no more business as usual,'' that's where I can stand up. I
don't need a consultation to do that. And I get plenty of advice on
one side of that question or the other, but I am absolutely
convinced this is right.
   And even those who are inconvenienced by this are going to say,
``Thank God we get the American people's business of getting this
deficit under control done.'' And that's my objective. And I think
every parent out there who sees his kid's future being mortgaged by
these outrageous deficits, sees a shaky economy that's being
affected by these, prolonging these deliberations, will be grateful
in the long run. In the meantime, you've got to take a little heat.
   Q: Mr. President, the budget resolution that failed is one that
you worked hard for. Despite the fact that you gave a nationally
televised speech and despite the fact that you're popularity is
very high, you failed to sway even a majority of votes in your own
Party. Does that concern you? And do you think this is a major
setback for your presidency?
   A: No. I don't think that at all. But I do think, yes, it
concerns me. I'd like everybody to do it exactly the way I want,
but it doesn't work that way. And so now we have to use a little
discipline - (unintelligible) - nice guy stuff and we'll try. This
is a tough decision. It's not an easy decision I've made, but it is
the right decision. So I'm disappointed they didn't do it my way,
but I'm in this, I'm in here to do what is best for the country.
And what is best for the country is to get this deficit under
control, to get this economy moving again and to see people at jobs
not out on some welfare line.
   And that's what's at stake here, the economic soundness of the
United States. And we've got a lot of things going on in the world
and a strong economy is absolutely, is vital to what I want to see
achieved for this country. So you have to take some hits. I mean,
you don't get it done exactly your, your own way. But I read these
speculative stories. Tomorrow there's going to be another vote.
Tomorrow somebody else will move the previous question or second
the motion or some committee chairman will jump up and say, ``Hey,
what about me? My little empire's being invaded here.'' And I'll
say, ``Hey, the President's the guy that has to look at the overall
picture.'' I can understand Congressmen doing that.
   But we came together on a deal. We worked for it. Everybody had
a chance to posture that didn't like it. They had no
responsibility. But I feel a certain responsibility to the American
people to move something forward here. So I've compromised. Now,
we're going to say, we're going to try it this way. No more
business as usual. Do not just keep putting off the day of
reckoning. And I don't want to be a part of that and that's why
I've had to veto this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, you talked a lot about discipline today. Do
you think the American people on average are willing to accept the
discipline of a tough budget agreement?
   A: That's a very good question. And if you look at the vote in
both, in the House of Representatives, you might say no. But I
think in the final analysis, the answer will be yes because I think
the, I think we sometimes underestimate the American, the
intelligence of the American people.
   I can see where a congressman can jump up on a specific, a
specific spending program that will help him in his district. Or I
can see when somebody'll give you the broad tax speech or some,
help him in his district. But in the final analysis, the -- what
the American people look at is, ``Do we have an economy in which I
can feed my family, where I can have an opportunity to work for a
living and where I can put a little aside to educate my kids?'' And
therein lies the problem, because that's what we're working for, is
we're trying to get this federal deficit down.
   But I think you raise a good point, I think a lot of these
congressmen can jump up without any responsibility for running the
country, or even cooperating with their leaders, and make a point
that's very happy for the home folks. But I think you
underestimate, I think that view underestimates the overall
intelligence of the American people, whether conservative, whether
a guy's working on a factory line some place, whether he's an
investor some place. So that's why I think this is very important
that the Congress now finally come to grips with this. Excuse me,
Ann.
   Q: Mr. President, it sounds like you're now saying hands off,
it's up to the congressional leaders to do the negotiating.
   A: Well, they are, they've already started up the road there to
go to Congress and start negotiating. But, no, we've made very
clear that we're continuing to help. I don't want to mislead them.
There are certain things I can accept, and certain things I can't.
So I think it's very important that our able team, in whom I have
total confidence, stay in touch with them. But -
   Q: But not sit at the negotiating table with them?
   A: Oh, I think they'll be there. I think it all depends on what
the forum is. I think there is some feeling, Ann, on the part of
members, both Democrat and Republicans - ``Hey, you know, you
summiteers handled, handed us a deal.'' Well, what the heck? I
mean, how do you expect to get, to get as far along toward an
agreement as we did get? But what I want to do is facilitate it.
And if they want to know where the White House is, fine. If they
want the ideas that that largely led to an agreement, fine. And I
think they will. But we're not going to force our way in. This is
the business of the Congress. The American people know that. They
know that the president doesn't pass the budget and doesn't vote on
all this stuff. It's the Congress that does it.
   Q: Mr. President ...
   A: And so I'm not trying to assign blame, I'm simply saying,
``We're available.'' If we want to talk, or in the way, fine. But
we're not. I think both leaders in there indicated they wanted to
stay in very close touch with the White House.
   Q Is there any talk of a constitutional challenge to Civiletti
on the Hill, that, that the Attorney General's opinion is not
sufficient to run the government, and it violates Article I,
Section 7 of the Constitution?
   A: Haven't heard anything about that, doesn't worry me.
   Q: Mr. President, are you going to cancel your campaign schedule
next week if this impasse is not resolved?
   A: I don't know. I've got to cancel everything that has to do
with government, I guess, but whether that -- maybe that's a good
chance to get out there in the political process.

   The grief-stricken royal family laid Princess
Caroline's husband, Stefano Casiraghi, to rest Saturday in a plot
overlooking the stretch of blue Mediterranean where he was killed
in a boat-racing accident.
   The private burial at the tiny Chapel of the Peace followed a
public funeral at Monaco's nearby cathedral. Thousands of people,
including tourists in bright beach outfits and citizens in black
mourning garb, crowded around the 115-year-old cathedral during the
tearful ceremony.
   The tiny, wealthy Riviera principality appeared sad but not
stricken by the same shock that accompanied the death of Caroline's
mother, Princess Grace, in a car accident in 1982.
   Gambling continued at the famed casinos without interruption.
Small businesses closed during the funeral but quickly reopened for
the afternoon.
   Casiraghi, 30, an Italian businessman, died instantly Wednesday
when his boat flipped during the World Offshore Championships. The
somersault slammed him headfirst into the water. The other driver,
Patrice Innocenti, was injured.
   ``The brutality of his death adds to our pain,'' Archbishop of
Monaco Joseph Sardou said at the service. ``The sea, so calm today,
holds dangers that must constantly be confronted.''
   Princess Caroline, 33, wept occasionally during the 55-minute
service as sunlight streamed through stained-glass windows and a
Bach dirge wafted from the organ.
   The princess wore dark sunglasses, a black-lace head-covering
and black dress. The three children from her seven-year marriage to
Casiraghi were not present.
   Referring to Caroline, Sardou said: ``It was through his union
with you, Madame, that he found the greatest expression of his
Christian faith.''
   Caroline occasionally leaned on her father, Prince Rainier, for
support. Prince Albert, heir to the realm, comforted younger sister
Princess Stephanie when she briefly fled the cathedral weeping.
   Only 1,600 of the several thousand mourners who began lining up
Saturday morning fit inside the cathedral. The rest remained
outside under the warm October skies.
   The mourners included Danielle Mitterrand, wife of French
president Francois Mitterrand, actor Alain Delon, exiled King
Michael of Romania, and fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld.
   Thousands of floral bouquets covered the cathedral's steps. The
brightly colored shorts and T-shirs worn by tourists contrasted
with stark black worn by Monaco's citizens.
   ``Oh, dear Stefano,'' sobbed one elderly Italian woman. ``I was
here for Grace's funeral and now I'm here to mourn young Stefano.
There is a curse on the royal house.''
   A white-uniformed, five-man honor guard wearing red-tasseled
hats stood stiffly at attention during the ceremony. Squads of
police kept watch on the mourners outside.
   As the service ended, a weeping Caroline walked out of the
cathedral clinging to the arm of her white-haired father.
   The princess decided to bury her husband at the simple chapel
over the objection of her in-laws, who wanted him interred in
Italy, French and Italian newspapers reported.
   Other commoners who have married into the ruling Grimaldi family
are buried at the site, including dancer John Gilpin, the late
husband of Rainier's sister, Antoinette.
   Princess Grace - the former Hollywood star Grace Kelly - is the
only commoner buried in the royal family tomb.
   Casiraghi married Caroline in a civil ceremony in 1983. In the
following seven years he became a prominent business leader here,
with major interests in real estate and development firms.
   The couple had three children: Andrea, 6; Charlotte, 4; and
Pierre, 3.
   Caroline has vainly sought a Vatican annulment of her unhappy
first marriage to French playboy Philippe Junot so that her
children with Casiraghi would be recognized by the Roman Catholic
Church.
   Casiraghi had been racing at world-class level since 1984 and
won the world championships in 1989 at Atlantic City, New Jersey.
He had told friends he planned to quit after this season.
   This year's championship was canceled. Fellow drivers laid a
wreath at the spot where he died, as did a helicopter from
Monacair, a company owned by Casiraghi.
   Some drivers said Casiraghi was going far too fast on the choppy
waters Wednesday. His catamaran, called a ``floating coffin'' by
local newspapers, lies about 2,000 feet under water.

   The planned U.S. buildup on the Arabian
peninsula is virtually complete, but American forces still lack the
firepower and supplies necessary to launch a successful ground
offensive against Iraqi troops in Kuwait, according to military
officials.
   The officials, in Washington and Saudi Arabia, said all of the
heavy armor being shipped to Saudi Arabia should arrive by week's
end, closing out the biggest phase of the two-month deployment and
bringing to nearly 200,000 the number of American troops in the
region.
   As evidence of the progress, Navy sources said that for the
first time since the buildup began, significant numbers of cargo
ships are returning to the United States from the Persian Gulf
without orders to quickly reload and head back.
   One of these sources, all of whom spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said at least 11 ships were heading home without new
orders to pick up Mideast-bound cargo.
   ``We're about to pass the buildup phase and move into the
sustainment phase,'' the Navy official said. ``The heavy lifting is
over.''
   Discussion of U.S. military options in the region has included
speculation that the American mission might shift from the defense
of Saudi Arabia to some offensive action against Iraqi forces once
the final U.S. armored units arrived to support heavy ground forces
already deployed in the northern Saudi desert.
   But as ships carrying those tanks, armored vehicles and heavy
artillery made their way to Saudi Arabia last week, military
officials were playing down the prospects for any offensive action.
   Indeed, most of the officials said the U.S. forces, even with
the final planned shipments of heavy armor, still would be well
short of the manpower and weapons capabilities needed to mount a
successful assault on the more than 400,000 Iraqi troops in heavily
fortified defensive positions in Kuwait and southern Iraq.
   ``We're in there for the long haul,'' said a Pentagon source.
``We do not have enough firepower nor do we have a logistical tail
in country to conduct an offensive campaign. ... Our plans don't
ever foresee us reaching that point.''
   Another Pentagon official, also speaking privately, said
administration officials at the White House or Pentagon who were
discussing possible offensive actions ``need to take a more sober
perspective.''
   ``We can guarantee the defense of Saudi Arabia, but going on
offense - that's wishful thinking,'' this official said. ``The
enemy is digging in and digging in and digging in. It would take a
lot more than we're planning on sending to move them out.''
   While some troops and equipment will be trickling into Saudi
Arabia and other U.S. positions in the region for as long as the
deployment lasts, Pentagon planners will consider the buildup
essentially completed when the final armored units en route take up
positions in the Saudi desert.
   These include roughly 13,500 troops from the 3rd Armored Cavalry
Regiment, from Fort Bliss, Texas; two brigades of the 1st Cavalry
Division from Fort Hood, Texas; and one brigade fro the 2nd
Armored Division, also from Fort Hood. Their equipment includes
hundreds of M-1 tanks and Bradley armored infantry carriers.
   As of Friday, all of the major equipment belonging to those
units was in or close to Saudi Arabia, with the exception of a
shipment of anti-aircraft guns scheduled to leave port in the
United States within days, according to Pentagon sources.
   To date 28,074 reservists have been called to active duty, said
Pentagon spokesman Bill Caldwell.
   And Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Friday that the call
up of reservists would remain within levels initially anticipated.
Some previously announced support units have been told they would
likely be activated but have not yet been called, Williams said.
   The next challenge for military planners, provided no
hostilities erupt, will be sustaining the force in the Mideast,
some 7,000 miles from the United States.
   Dozens of support trucks and scores of pallets loaded with
materiel and supplies are being prepared for shipment to the
region, and some of the ships now returning without orders might be
called upon in the near future to make another trip to Saudi
Arabia.
   ``There's all kinds of stuff that doesn't have to be there in
the first days and weeks that we will need to stay there for any
length of time,'' one of the Pentagon source said. ``But there's
not the same sense of urgency with these things.''

   Q: How long, how long can you hold out? How long can you let the
government stay shut down before you decide the cost has been too
great?
   A: Watch and learn.
   Q: How long do you think government can stay shut before ...
   A: It's not a question of how long I can take it, it's how long
the Congress can take it. The Congress is where the action is. It's
the Congress that has to pass this in the House and in the Senate.
That's where the action is. They've postponed this tough decision,
as I mentioned, how many, 30-some times, and we just can't have it.
   The American people are saying, ``I want something done about
this.'' And that's where the focus will be. So I don't think it's a
question of taking heat here. These guys marching out here about
honking their horns, of taxes, they know I don't like taxes. You
get some other guy marching out here with a little placard
demonstrating, giving something about the government employees. I,
we've been supporters of the government employees, but we cannot
have business as usual. The American people, I don't know about
inside the beltway, but outside they are fed up with business as
usual and so am I.
   And I wish I had total control so we could do it exactly my way,
but we don't, so I've compromised and now we're prepared to say I'm
not going to accept a resolution that just postpones it. I've told
you I've tried that approach, tried it in August, let everybody go
home on vacation when I had some good, sound advice I probably
should have taken: make the Congress stay in August.
   And I listened to the leaders. And I said - they said, ``Oh,
please don't do that. It'll be counterproductive.'' Now, they're
saying to me, ``Please don't veto this, it'll be'' - when do the
American people have a say? They want to see this deficit under
control. And I don't have many weapons here as president, but one
is the veto. And when I do it, cast it on principle I hope it is
supported.
   Q: Mr. President, when Dole sends up another CR, or if the
Congress sends up a CR with sequestration, when could that happen?
Could you give us some timeframe?
   A: I don't know.
   Q Could it happen in the next couple of days, sir?
   A: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. It could happen this afternoon.
   Q: So it could happen this afternoon?
   A: Sure. When they get together.
   Q: And it came up to ...
   A: Now, I'm not, that ...
   Q: Sure.
   A: That perhaps is a little oversimplification, because they are
telling me there's some difficult problems right and left, both
sides. But, no, they're going right back to negotiating. And let's
hope it does. That's the way to serve the people.
   Q: If it came up this afternoon, sir, would you sign it this
afternoon?
   A: Depends what it is.
   Q: You have vetoed the ...
   A: I'll be around.
   Q: You have vetoed the CR.
   A: Yeah, Well, I haven't actually signed it, but I've got to
rush right in there now and do that and send it up to the Hill.
They know that they've ... (inaudible).
   (Cross talk.)
   A: Last question.
   Q: What's all this done to the prestige and influence of you and
your office?
   A: I think it will demonstrate that there is some power in the
presidency to get the, to compel the Congrss to do something, and
I think that's good.
   Q: You are veto ...
   A: Oh yeah, it'll, it hasn't been vetoed yet. But I just, it's
had, needed, need a typewriter in there to get it done. But it, by
the time we finish this press conference that has gone longer than
I thought, it'll probably all be typed up.
   Q: Might you trade the bubble for capital gains, now? Do you
foresee that an answer?
   A: Our negotiators are, have a lot of, the negotiators in the
Congress have a lot of flexibility. I remain in a flexible frame of
mind. Certain things I can accept and can't, but I'd like to think
that now, they'll - those who postured on one side or another with
no responsibility will join the leaders, Republican and Democrat,
and say, ``Hey, we got a responsibility to the overall good, here.
We can no longer just give a speech, we've got to pitch in and come
together.''
   And that's, that's what my pitch is. And that's why I'm doing
this veto, saying, ``Hey, no more business as usual.'' And I, I
think people understand that sometime a president has to make a
difficult decision. And so I don't worry about the prestige. I, I'm
selected to do what, what - faced like this - what I think is best
and in the national interest, and that's exactly what I'm doing.
   Thank you, all, very much.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Waite, Other Hostages May Be Released This Week</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lebanon's leading newspaper reported
Saturday that Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite and some other
Westerners held hostage by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groups may be
released this week.
   An-Nahar, which has a record of accurate reporting on the
captives, attributed its short report to informed sources but did
not identify them.
   The paper indicated that the releases would follow visits to
Syria and possibly to Lebanon by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati.
   Velayati was to visit Damascus ``in the next two days for
consultations with the Syrian command'' of President Hafez Assad
and might travel to Beirut for talks with President Elias Hrawi,
the report said.
   ``The release of a number of foreign hostages held in Lebanon,
topped by Anglican Chrich envoy Terry Waite, is possible next
week,'' the newspaper said in its Saturday edition.
   It gave no further details. The one-paragraph reference to the
hostages was part of the paper's main front-page story.
   An-Nahar did not disclose the nationalities of the hostages to
be released, beyond identifying Waite. But the report was the
latest of several to indicate that foreign captives would be freed
following renewed diplomatic ties between Britain and Iran.
   The two nations restored ties last month after an 18-month break
over British author Salman Rushdie's book ``The Satanic Verses,''
which Iran said defamed Islam.
   Hussein Musawi, the Shiite mentor of some hostage-holding
factions, said Sept. 29 that the four British hostages would
benefit from the development.
   Musawi said, however, that the six American captives were not
expected to be released soon because of the U.S. military
deployment in the Persian Gulf following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   ``Improving relations and the new British conduct toward Iran
would serve British interests in general, including the British
hostages,'' said Musawi, whose Islamic Amal movement falls under
the Hezbollah umbrella.
   Waite, 51, the personal envoy of the Archbishop of Canterbury
Robert Runcie, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987. He had left his hotel in
Moslem west Beirut for a meeting with Islamic Jihad, or Islamic
Holy War, the underground faction believed holding American
hostages Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland.
   No group has claimed Waite's abduction, but former Irish hostage
Brian Keenan, released in August, said he was held with the
Anglican envoy for a while in the same house.
   Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held foreign hostage in Lebanon. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   In addition to Waite, the British captives are journalist John
McCarthy, World War II flier Jack Mann and writer Alec Collett.
   McCarthy, 33, was kidnapped April 17, 1986, as he drove to
Beirut airport to catch a flight to London. Mann, 76, was kidnapped
in Beirut May 12, 1989.
   Collet, a New York-based writer on assignment in Lebanon for the
U.N. Relief and Works Agency, was kidnapped March 25, 1985.
   The Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Moslems, believed
linked to Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal, claimed on April 23,
1986 that it hanged Collett in retaliation for Britain's support of
U.S. air raids on Libya.
   No body has been found, but British officials believe Collett is
dead.
   The 13 Western captives, held mainly by pro-Iranian factions in
Lebanon, also include two Germans and an Italian.
   The An-Nahar article also said Velayati was to develop, along
with Syrian and Lebanese leaders, a settlement to the 3-year-old
conflict between two rival Shiite Moslem militias - the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah and the more secular Amal.
   On Saturday, the two militias fought a 30-minute battle in the
slums of south Beirut before Syrian troops separated the
combatants.
   Police said two people were killed and three wounded in the
clash with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers
a few blocks from where the western captives are believed held.
   That raised the overall toll of the Amal-Hezbollah power
struggle to 1,099 killed and 3,225 wounded since the conflict broke
out in June 1985.
   Syria is Amal's main ally and has a limited influence on
Hezbollah through its close ties with Iran.
   About 40,000 Syrian troops went into Lebanon under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate from the 21-nation Arab League. Syria is the
main power broker in Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war.

   No huddled masses assembled Saturday at the
Statue of Liberty, which was shut down by a tired and poor federal
government.
   Thousands of sightseers from around the United States and the
world felt one of the first effects of the federal budget dispute.
They trekked to lower Manhattan to catch ferries to Liberty and
Ellis islands only to find the boats weren't running.
   ``It's very annoying,'' said Magdalene Kopp of Heidelberg,
Germany. ``It's something I came to the United States to see.''
   Instead of the outstretched arm of Lady Liberty or Ellis
Island's cavernous waiting room, tourists were greeted by a
disheartening monotone announcement over loudspeakers:
   ``Attention visitors: The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island are
closed until further notice. Sorry for the inconvenience.''
   Helen Bealka, 62, traveled from St. Paul, Minn., to see Ellis
Island, where her father first set foot in America.
   ``This is horrible. I don't know if I'll live long enough to
come back,'' she said.
   The Ellis Island closing came less than a month after the
renovated area was reopened to the public.
   The closures resulted from Bush's refusal to sign a stopgap
spending plan as his administration and Congress haggled over a new
budget.
   Getting turned away from the nation's symbol of freedom was
enough to convince most visitors they were the victims of undue
suffering at politicians' hands.
   ``It's a disgrace when reasonable people can't agree on
something. Why can't these clowns get together on this?'' said
Henry Bowman, 44, of Cookeville, Tenn. ``This was our one chance to
go.''
   Said Abigail Hoffman, 33, of New York City: ``I wish they'd make
some hard choices. That's why they were voted in.''
   National Park Service employee Eli Mecardo usually sells Liberty
Island ferry tickets, but on Saturday he, too, was turned back.
   ``They just told us to go home,'' he said. ``They said the
government ran out of money and we're not getting paid.''
   Although most people grumbled and cursed Washington, a few
thought the inconvenience was for the common good.
   ``I'm disappointed, but it's one of the things that happen in
government,'' said Ruth Flaton, 72, of Elmont. ``Maybe it's one way
to balance the budget. I think Bush did the right thing.''

   Riot police wielding batons and shields
prevented pro-democracy campaigners from meeting Saturday to
establish Zambia's first legal opposition party in 17 years.
   Paramilitary units stood guard outside the Moon City Night Club
in the Zambian capital, barring hundreds of would-be party
delegates from entering.
   The legal committee of the so-called Movement for Multi-Party
Democracy, which called the meeting, immediately filed an
injunction with the High Court against the police.
   But High Court Judge Bobby Bwalya postponed the hearing for a
week so officials from the movement and from President Kenneth
Kaunda's ruling United National Independence Party could testify.
   There was no immediate comment from the government.
   Kaunda, 66, who led Zambia to independence from Britain as a
Western-style democracy in 1964, imposed a one-party state in 1973.
   Last month, under mounting pressure from lawyers, students,
trade unionists and businessmen, Kaunda agreed to rewrite the
constitution to legalize opposition parties.
   Earlier, he legalized the pro-democracy group and announced
multiparty elections would be held next August to allow his 7.5
million people to decide what political system they want.
   But police refused to issue a permit for Saturday's conference,
despite earlier government assurances that opposition groups could
hold meetings.
   Levi Mwanawasa, head of the movement's legal committee, told 400
supporters at the group's headquarters that the meeting had to be
canceled because of the police blockade.
   ``We are not going to give up,'' chairman Arthur Wina, a former
Kaunda loyalist and onetime Cabinet minister, told the gathering.
``But our patience is running out. We're being pushed against a
wall.''
   In the central Copperbelt province mining city of Kitwe, the
Zambian Congress of Trade Unions passed a motion Saturday calling
for Kaunda's resignation.
   Similar calls for Kaunda to step down have been made since
rioting over increased food prices in July left at least 26 people
dead.
   Opponents accuse Kaunda of corruption, mismanagement,
authoritarianism and nepotism.

   Police are hoping a light blue silk scarf
once owned by the singer Madonna will come into vogue when it's put
on the auction block.
   The scarf went with a $20,000 blue-sequined dress owned by the
Michigan native. The ensemble was stolen two years ago from an MTV
display at Twelve Oaks Mall in this hamlet about 15 miles northwest
of Detroit.
   The dress was found three days later and returned, but police
forgot until recently to return the scarf. And now MTV doesn't seem
to want it.
   ``All attempts to return it have fallen on deaf ears,'' said
Novi police officer Robert Gatt, who handled the purloined-clothing
case. Thus, the scarf became property of the department, which is

Education program.
   The scarf will fetch at least $500, which is the minimum the

   As for the clothing caper culprit, an overzealous fan was
convicted of larceny and sentenced to probation.

   CORAOPOLIS, Pa. (AP) - Actor Michael Keaton has given the Roman
Catholic school he once attended mounds of memorabilia from his hit
movie ``Batman.''
   Keaton, who played the caped crusader in the 1989 film, sent
toys, dolls, videocassettes and other items to the St. Malachy
Roman Catholic School and church for its annual Nationalities
Festival.
   Keaton attended grade school at St. Malachy and his mother is a
parishioner at the church, according to a church secretary.
   The festival, which began Thursday and concludes Sunday, raises
money to fund parish activities, according to the secretary, who
declined to give her name.
   Keaton, who stars in the recently released thriller, ``Pacific
Heights,'' appeared in one movie made in Pittsburgh, ``Gung Ho,''
which told the story of Japanese auto makers who took over an
abandoned American factory.

   Dee Brown, a National Basketball
Association hopeful, is moving to this affluent Boston suburb
despite an incident in which the town's police forced him to the
ground at gunpoint.
   Brown, who's black, was confronted by Wellesley police who had
mistaken him for a bank robber Sept. 21.
   ``I'm going to make my home in Wellesley,'' Brown told WBZ-TV in
Boston in interview broadcast Friday. ``It makes me feel confident
that me and my fiancee will be safe there.''
   But Brown, the Boston Celtics No. 1 draft choice, also
authorized his lawyer to consider suing the town after private
negotiations failed to work out a settlement over his detention by
police.
   ``The town has chosen the position that racism was not a factor
and that all of the police procedures were proper and correct,''
said Brown's lawyer, Alan Margolies. ``We disagree.''
   Margolies said he had offered the town a deal but was rebuffed.
He did not return telephone calls seeking details of his proposed
settlement, nor would Wellesley officials disclose it.
   Brown, a 6-foot-1 point guard who participated in the first day
of training camp Friday, said he had received letters and petitions
from Wellesley residents asking him to move there. Blacks make up
less than 2 percent of the town's population.
   ``You don't want a rap like that on your town, that every time a
black person (or) a suspicious person or everybody that doesn't
look like a Wellesley citizen, you have to check them or ID them,''
Brown said.

   NEW YORK (AP) - William F. Buckley Jr., the founder of National
Review, says he will soon leave the position he has held as ranking
editor for 35 years at the conservative biweekly magazine.
   The 64-year-old author, TV commentator and editor said he would
become an editor at large. He spoke late Friday at a banquet for
the magazine.
   The 35th anniversary issue, which is to be published in two
weeks, will be his last as the top editor.
   Buckley told about 800 guests, ``We did as much as anybody, with
the exception of himself, to shepherd into the White House Ronald
Reagan.''
   Buckley, who also will step down as chief executive officer of
the magazine, will be replaced by Wick Allison, the current
publisher. The ranking editor will be John O'Sullivan, who will
continue in his title as editor.

   An American widow whose daughter and
son-in-law were killed in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 was
married Saturday in this small town where the local people had been
kind to her.
   Marion Alderman, 63, of Camden, N.Y., married Edward Jablonski,
68, of Rome, N.Y., at All Saints Church in a ceremony attended by
20 Lockerbie villagers.
   ``It is a great joy to be here today for this happy ceremony
after all the grief that Lockerbie has seen,'' said the Rev. Alan
Neal, rector of All Saints.
   Town councilor Hugh Young gave the bride away. He and his wife,
Linda, were witnesses.
   ``We're so happy,'' said the new Mrs. Jablonski. ``It was a
beautiful ceremony and everyone has been wonderful.''
   Her daughter, Paula, 29, and Paula's British husband Glenn
Bouckley were killed while flying home to Syracuse, N.Y. after
attending the wedding of Glenn's brother.
   They were among 259 passengers who died when the Boeing 747 was
blown apart by a terrorist bomb on Dec. 21, 1988. Eleven Lockerbie
residents were also killed on the ground.
   ``I first visited the town six months after the disaster and put
a wooden cross in the golf course where my daughter's body
landed,'' the bride said Friday. ``The locals were very kind and
considerate.''
   She was among the relatives visiting Lockerbie this week for a
public inquiry into the bombing.
   Jablonski, an electronics engineer, said Saturday: ``We couldn't
have found a nicer place to get married. We originally intended to
wait until next year, but Marion had already planned her trip to
Lockerbie and we thought it would be a good idea to have the
ceremony here.
   ``It's our way of paying tribute to the local people. Marion has
told me how well they treated her and other bereaved relatives
after the disaster.''

   The biggest human airlift in aviation
history is ferrying hundreds of penniless Asian refugees from the
Persian Gulf to their homelands daily, but a shortage of relief aid
could clip its wings.
   Relief officials also fear that many of the estimated 2 million
foreigners still in Iraq and Kuwait may soon flee as well, putting
enormous strain on the operation and on Jordan, the main escape
route.
   Some 422,400 refugees, mainly Egyptian and Asians, have been
flown out of Jordan in more than 1,798 flights by military and
civilian aircraft since Aug. 5, Jordanian civil aviation officials
said.
   Another 60,000 have been flown home from Turkey and hundreds of
thousands, mainly Egyptians, have been taken home by sea.
   ``This is the biggest airlift operation ever undertaken in civil
aviation,'' said J.N. Mahajan, the Indian consul-general in Dubai,
who has overseen the repatriation of nearly 17,000 of his
countrymen through the southern gulf state.
   On Saturday, the United Nations announced a contingency plan to
help refugees if the gulf crisis escalates or extends into the
winter. U..N. Undersecretary-general Mohammed Essaafi said the
world body's disaster relief agency and Jordanian officials are
preparing food stockpiles to feed up to 120,000 more refugees.
   They also are buying winter tents to replace the summer tents in
Jordanian refugee camps.
   Half the 335,000 Egyptians who fled Kuwait and Iraq after Saddam
Hussein's Aug. 2 invasion of the gulf emirate have been airlifted
home by the Cairo government. Most of the estimated 70,000 Indians
repatriated have been flown home.
   All told, some 900,000 people have fled into Jordan, Saudi
Arabia, Turkey, Syria and Iran in the last two months, 720,000 of
them through Jordan alone.
   The State Department fears that as conditions deteriorate
because of U.N.-imposed economic sanctions, many of the 2 million
foreigners still in Iraq and Kuwait will try to flee.
   U.N. relief officials have warned that there could be a new
surge in the exodus soon because the Iraqis have said they will cut
food rations to foreigners trapped in the two countries. Jordanian
authorities expect 80,000 new refugees in the next week.
   All this will intensify the pressure on relief workers, who are
now seeking to help the refugees through the approaching winter,
and will cost tens of millions of dollars.
   Many of the relief flights are organized by the Geneva-based
International Organization for Migration. One of its senior
officials, David Whittlesey, said in a telephone interview that
more money is needed urgently to pay for the airlift.
   Whittlesey said the relief effort ``in its scale and nature, is
a unique situation.''
   ``It's extremely difficult to predict the rate of flow from Iraq
and Kuwait, which nationalities these refugees will be, where they
will want to go, what condition they'll be in. It's a logistical
nightmare.''
   The Indian government has paid more than $14 million to Air
India to ferry more than 13,000 citizens out by Oct. 3.
   Iraq last month allowed the Indian air force to send in four
flights a day to the southern port of Basra to evacuate about 1,000
Indian nationals daily.
   Pakistan has evacuated some 45,000 of the 190,000 nationals it
had in Iraq and Kuwait, mainly through Jordan. Thailand's national
carrier has flown more than 40 flights carrying more than 7,500
Thai refugees from Jordan and Saudi Arabia to Bangkok.
   The U.S. government last month flew some 1,900 of its citizens
out of Baghdad in chartered jetliners after Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein allowed them to leave. Another group is expected to fly out
on Wednesday, officials said.
   The Soviet Union has flown more than 2,500 of its people out of
Iraq in Aeroflot jetliners. And Brazil chartered an Iraqi Airways
jumbo jet last week to fly out 173 of its citizens after weeks of
tough negotiations.

   Navy Yeoman 1st Class Patrice Davis
says a military career might not be for everybody. But her family
is the sort recruiters dream about.
   Of the eight children in the Elmore family of Charleston, S.C.,
six are in U.S. military service, and three are assigned to Saudi
Arabia.
   On Saturday, Patrice, the oldest at 28, held an emotional
reunion with her sister, Army Sgt. 1st Class Darnetha Elmore, 25, a
member of an intelligence unit, and her brother, Army Spec. Loris
Elmore, 21, a paratrooper.
   It was their first meeting since all three became part of the
170,000 Americans deployed under Operation Desert Shield following
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   There were grins and hugs as the trio met at a hotel in Dhahran
where Patrice, known to friends as ``Mo,'' works in the Joint
Information Bureau operated by the Saudi Information Ministry and
the U.S. military command.
   Then they went off to Patrice's room to talk family and call
their mother, Sandra, back in Charleston.
   Patrice, normally based in Alexandri,, Va., said she volunteered
for duty in Saudi Arabia because ``aside from the ones on ships,''
many Navy people don't get the chance to travel. She said she
checked with her husband and two days later was on her way.
   Loris, a member of the 82nd Airborne Division, said that when
members of his unit learned he had two sisters in Saudi Arabia,
``they said, `Well, you don't get much mail, so they're mailing
your family over here'.''
   The three agreed that being together in the potential war zone
was worrisome.
   ``I think about it but I don't dwell on it,'' said Patrice.
   Darnetha, describing herself as ``a sort of upbeat person,''
said of her brothers and sisters that she didn't mind being in
Saudi Arabia ``as long as I can see them and know they're OK. I try
not to think about the bad stuff.''
   Loris said it helps to know his sisters ``can handle it if they
ever get into a situation.
   ``I still worry a lot, but I know they're going to be coming
home on their own two feet,'' he said.
   Patrice said she enlisted in the Navy while still in high school
and left for the service 13 days after graduation. ``I was being a
rebel,'' she recalled. ``My father wanted me to go to college. I
just wanted to do my own thing.''
   Her example led the others to follow suit, although only one
brother, Lee Anthony, 27, opted for the Navy. He is assigned to a
ship based at Charleston.
   Also in the military are brothers Tracy, 22, an Army specialist
based at Flint Hills Farm, Va., and Donnie, 20, a specialist
serving with an Army Signal Corps unit in South Korea.
   Two other sisters in Charleston are Michelle, 24, a patient care
assistant, and Sherita, 14, who lives with their mother.
   Saturday's phone call to the Elmore home lasted 25 minutes,
Patrice said, and included ``nothing about over here.''
   She said her mother ``wanted to know how we are and whether
we're eating all right, if we got all her letters. And we just got
caught up on gossip.''

<HEAD>Fed Up With Politics As Usual, Public Seeks To Limit Terms,
Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HILLIARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The public, as usual, is fed up with politics as
usual. But disgruntled voters in three states and one city are
considering turning their grumbling into action on Nov. 6.
   Ballot proposals in Colorado, California and Missouri would
limit how long elected officials can serve. Proposals creating
state ethics panels also are on ballots in Missouri and California.
   Missouri's proposed amendment would also reduce the size of the
House from 163 to 103 members by 2003, and shorten legislative
sessions.
   Bolstering support for the amendment were the convictions of two
Missouri House members in U.S. District Court last month: one on
felony drug charges, the other for conspiring to steal union
property and sell it to repay a federal grant.
   Colorado's proposal would not only limit state legislators, the
governor and other state officeholders to eight years in office,
but also impose a cap of 12 years for U.S. House and Senate
members. Critics question whether such a cap would be permissable
under the federal constitution.
   Kansas City, Mo., residents will decide on Election Day whether
to limit City Council members to two four-year terms. That proposal
could force nine of 13 members out of office next April.
   Oklahoma voters recently approved an amendment limiting state
lawmakers to 12 years in office, effective Jan. 1, and also
established an ethics comission.
   Arizonans, meanwhile, are considering a pay increase for state
legislators to $24,000 from $15,000. The last such raise, which
must be approved by voters under state law, was in 1981. They
defeated a similar recommendation in 1988.
   Skepticism about public officials has, of course, a long
history.
   A half century ago, H.L. Mencken wrote: ``At each election we
vote in a new set of politicians, insanely assuming that they are
better than the set turned out. And at each election we are, as
they say ... done in.''
   But ballot issues limiting legislators' terms are unprecedented,
said Karl Kurtz, director of state services for National Conference
of State Legislatures. Some states have limited governors' terms
before, though, he said.
   ``I think this is occurring because of disillusionment over
government ... and it is showing in election returns,'' Kurtz said.
``I don't think any one thing has forced this. It's just a general
sense of unhappiness with governmental institutions and the image
of politicians.''
   Kurtz called the propositions ``anti-democratic in spirit.''
   The Colorado proposal is spearheaded by state Sen. Terry
Considine, a Republican from wealthy Cherry Hills Village who
believes the state Legislature, like Congress, is gridlocked.
   ``It's not that we do the wrong things; it's that we don't
tackle the real problems,'' Considine said. ``We work very hard at
incremental improvements, but we are much less successful at
accomplishing real change.''
   Two years ago, Colorado voters limited annual legislative
sessions to 120 days.
   Term limitations are addressed in two proposals on California's
November ballot - Proposition 131 and Proposition 140. Politicians,
including Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, are mobilizing to kill
both.
   One proposition is a clean government amendment with ethics and
campaign finance provisions, including term limitations allowing
legislators to serve 12 years in each house of the California State
Assembly, or 24 years total.
   The other, more stringent proposal would bar legislators from
serving more than eight years in the State Senate and six in the
House. It would have the effect of cutting the Legislature's next
fiscal year budget by as much as half.

   Today's state-of-the-art solar car looks
like a waist-high, 20-foot-long, bright yellow plastic tadpole.
Getting in without breaking it is an adventure, and only one person
will fit.
   And taking one home from the showroom isn't likely soon - the
price tag comes to about $650,000, plus $350,000 for computers and
other ancillary equipment.
   But the squat, yellow University of Michigan Sunrunner has one
thing going for it: It's a national champion in solar speed, and
it's headed for an international challenge on the roadways of
Australia next month.
   In July, the Sunrunner and 31 other solar-powered cars built by
college teams raced from Florida's Disney World to General Motors
Corp.'s Technical Center in the Detroit suburb of Warren. The
Sunrunner, traveling by day and resting overnight, won the
1,641-mile race with a time of 72 hours, 50 minutes and 47 seconds,
averaging 22.5 mph.
   GM is sending the Sunrunner and other top finishers to the World
Solar Challenge 1990 race. In all, 43 cars from 10 countries are
entered in the race, which begins Nov. 11 and will stretch 1,863
miles from Darwin on Australia's northern coast to Adelaide on the
south coast.
   For the race, the Sunrunner team hopes to reach an average speed
of 32 mph.
   To take the car out for a recent test drive at the Michigan
International Speedway, industrial engineer Paula Finnegan had to
buckle on a safety harness, then have a colleague boost her up into
the open top of the car. Inside, she balanced on the
aluminum-tubing skeleton and the hammocklike seat slung down in the
frame.
   She then threaded her legs through the jungle-gym-like tubing to
the accelerator and brake, reclined in the seat, buckled on harness
straps and put on a headset with earpiece and microphone.
   The Sunrunner still wasn't ready. Three people gingerly lifted
its floppy plastic canopy from the ground, lowered it over Finnegan
and sealed it in place with bright yellow tape.
   During test laps, it reached 23 mph on a mostly sunny day with
thin, high clouds. For faster speeds or hills, the Sunrunner's
circuitry draws on battery help. At slower speeds, or going
downhill, it puts excess power from the solar cells back into the
batteries.
   In bright sun, the solar cells produce about 1,200 watts, enough
to power a toaster oven, hair dryer, or the 500-pound Sunrunner.
Cloudy weather can cut the power to 300 to 400 watts, enough for a
bright light bulb.
   A 1.5 horsepower electric motor the size of a coffee can powers
the car via chain drive on one of the 26-inch mountain-bike wheels.
   There's a viewing slot to view the road ahead, and a rearward
facing fiber-optic viewer that allows the driver to get an idea of
what's behind.
   Two ports in the front of the cockpit bring in fresh air. ``The
drivers said it wasn't too bad as long as they kept moving,'' said
Mike McAlear, strategist for the team.
   For now, electric cars will have to rely on batteries. Solar
cells and motors must become more efficient before energy straight
from the sun can propel a car faster than 30 mph.
   Solar cars therefore aren't on the verge of practical commuting,
Finnegan said.
   ``Not any time in the near future, but with improved technology
it can happen.''

<HEAD>Opponents Demand Roh's Apology for Alleged Surveillance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition legislators demanded
Saturday that President Roh Tae-woo apologize for alleged political
surveillance by military intelligence agents.
   The nation's main opposition group, the Party for Peace and
Democracy, urged Roh to overhaul the Defense Security Command - the
military surveillance unit - and end military interference in
politics.
   The party also demanded a full explanation from Roh of the
alleged activities.
   The outcry followed the disclosure Friday of alleged evidence of
undercover operations by the command against 1,300 dissidents,
journalists, intellectuals and lawmakers from both the opposition
and government.
   The alleged evidence was revealed by Yoon Suk-yang, a
24-year-old army private who deserted from the security command
taking with him classified papers, computer discs and other data.
   The data included the names and personal records of ruling party
chairman Kim Young-sam, opposition leader Kim Dae-jung and 89 other
lawmakers.
   The data characterized Kim Dae-jung as ``dangerous,
untrustworthy'' and showed that Kim Young-sam and his followers
were under surveillance even after his party joined the ruling
group in January.
   The Defense Ministry said the data and other materials were
stolen from the security command, but said such data was kept not
for political surveillance but to ``protect those listed from
enemies or impure elements.'' The ministry did not elaborate.
   The government has two powerful intelligence organizations - the
Defense Security Command and the Agency for National Security
Planning.
   Disgraced former president Chun Doo-hwan, who is in rural exile,
headed the command in 1980 when he seized power with other military
officers. Roh played a role as an army division commander.
   Roh has promised to maintain the military's political neutrality
since he took office in early 1988, but Friday's revelations forced
some to question that pledge.
   Both ruling and opposition party leaders demanded that Roh fully
account for the military's surveillance activity. Kim Dae-jung's
party called for a public investigation saying the command was used
to bolster authoritarian rules.
   Roh captured two-thirds of the legislative seats in January by
merging his party with two conservative opposition groups.
Opponents claim the merger was an attempt to prolong his rule and
gain enough votes to seek political changes.
   Political tension has heightened since all 78 opposition members
of the 299-member National Assembly resigned in August, charging
Roh with railroading bills through the legislature and ignoring
calls for reform.
   The opposition has refused to return to the assembly and demands
elections for a new legislature.

<HEAD>Controversial Former Head of Egyptian Antiquities Dies in US</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ahmed Kadry, who headed the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization through a turbulent six years that began
and ended with rocks falling from the Sphinx, has died in the
United States, friends said Saturday. He was 59.
   Kadry's friends said he died Thursday in Pittsburgh, where he
was awaiting a liver transplant. Suffering from liver cancer, he
fell into a coma before the operation could be performed.
   ``He was honest, active, brave, frank,'' said Gamal Mukhtar,
another former chairman of the antiquities organization.
   Kadry's career was long and turbulent. He was among the young
officers who joined Lt. Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser in the 1952 coup
that ended the monarchy and eventually led to republican Egypt.
   Kadry later was to spend time in Nasser's jails during one of
the former dictator's crackdowns on dissent.
   After his military career, Kadry spent 26 years with the
Egyptian Antiquities Organization.
   He became chairman in 1982 after a stone fell from the decaying
Sphinx and cost his predecessor the job. Six years later, Kadry was
fired in a similar controversy when a rock fell from the right
shoulder of the giant statue in February 1988.
   Soon after, Culture Minister Farouk Hosni and Kadry engaged in a
heated public argument. Hosni, Kadry's boss, charged that a
restoration project in progress since Kadry became chairman had
endangered the monument.
   Kadry retaliated with allegations that the minister's agents
hammered the stone out to embarrass him. Hosni fired Kadry.
   A bitter Kadry left Egypt to join the faculty of Tokyo's Waseda
University.
   Criticism of Kadry's Sphinx restoration continues. But in recent
months some critics have praised his other achievements as
chairman. A television commentator referred to his tenure as ``the
golden age of Egyptian antiquities.''
   Kadry is best remembered for restoration work on ancient mosques
and other Islamic monuments, including Saladin's fortress
overlooking Cairo and his small fort in the Gulf of Aqaba.
   The strong-willed Kadry became chairman of antiquities as the
outside world was starting to realize that Egypt's vast historic
legacy wouldn't last forever.
   Pollution, underground salt, a burgeoning population, neglect
and mass tourism were destroying the monuments. Looking for ways to
stop the decay, or at least slow it down, Kadry shifted his
organization's emphasis from excavation to preservation.
   He turned to foreign help and imported technology to fight the
battle. For this, commentators assailed him vigorously, accusing
him of letting foreigners pillage Egypt's past as they had done
during colonial times.

   Republican gubernatorial candidate Mary Mead
is sorry for a speech she made - but not because of anything she
said.
   ``I got reports saying it was boring and that I hadn't really
said anything,'' she said.
   A week after the Sept. 19 speech, she wrote a letter to
apologize for the speech ``not necessarily to change anybody's mind
about me, but just to let them know that it mattered to me.''
   Mead addressed the Wyoming Association of County Officials and
lightly touched on court reform, recycling, and legalized gambling,
among other topics.
   In her letter, she said she heard people say that she ``didn't
address the issues'' and ``wasted an opportunity to make a
favorable impression on some important Wyoming voters.''
   ``And, regrettably, I agree,'' Mead wrote. ``Even before I left
your meeting I knew that my remarks had not served me well. Some
days are great and some aren't - and I wish I could redo that
one.''
   Mead is hoping to unseat incumbent Gov. Mike Sullivan, who's
seeking his second term in the state's executive office.

<HEAD>Government Shutdown Turns Back Tourists From Nation's Parks,

   Nine-year-old Michael Woodward went looking
for pandas and koala bears at the National Zoo on Saturday, but
instead found locked and shuttered buildings because of a budget
fight between the White House and Congress.
   ``I'm really disappointed. I've been saving for a long time for
this trip. I guess I'll have to come back to see the pandas,'' said
the boy, who journeyed from Harrisburg, Pa., with his parents and a
church group to see the zoo.
   The zoo's grounds were open but huts housing reptiles, apes,
birds and aquatic life were closed.
   The scene was duplicated at some of the nation's most famous
tourist spots - from the Statue of Liberty in New York to the St.
Louis Arch - as President Bush's decision to shut down
non-essential services took effect early Saturday in the absence of
a budget agreement.
   ``I think it's a cheap shot - closing the (Smithsonian
Institution) museums like this. You can bet they didn't cut their
salaries,'' Maria Raices, a New Hampshire resident, complained
about Congress' and the White House's inability to settle the
budget dispute that allowed the government to run out of money.
   If tourists were inconvenienced, most federal workers had not
yet felt the impact of possible furloughs. A three-day Columbus Day
weekend meant most cuts would not be felt until Tuesday at the
earliest. And the Bush administration said it had authority to
maintain essential services - such as the military, prisons and the
air traffic control system - well beyond then.
   The National Hurricane Center announced plans to remain in
business, and was continuing to keep tabs on Tropical Storm Klaus.
   That was little comfort to those who flocked on Saturday to the
nation's capital in hopes of visiting its famed attractions - the
White House tours, the Washington Monument, the Smithsonian's 13
museums and art galleries.
   ``Their first comment, in harmony, was `It stinks,''' Boy Scout
leader Bill Johnson said of his scouts' reaction to finding the
National Air and Space Museum closed. The troop had traveled from
Roanoke Rapids, N.C., to spend the day sightseeing.
   The 15 scouts marched down the Mall, past the closed museums
toward the Capitol, hoping they could get in to see Congress.
   ``Maybe this won't be a lost weekend, after all. The boys won't
forget this and I expect they'll go home and tell their parents
about what happened to them,'' Johnson said.
   At the air and space museum, tourists packing cameras and video
equipment pressed their noses against the glass front, straining to
glimpse the NASA rockets, boosters and airplanes suspended from the
ceiling inside.
   ``This one's closed, too, Dad. The people are just peeking
inside,'' one youngster glumly called out.
   Evelyn Abes of New York City, who was wrapping up a five-day
visit to Washington with her 9-year-old grandson, had been saving
the air and space tour for last.
   ``This was going to be the highlight of our trip,'' she said,
waving toward the museum. ``I guess we'll have to do the car stuff
now. ...
   ``The government's shutdown is not making you stop eating or
causing a loss of blood or anything, but this is a quality of life
issue, enlightening children and helping them learn about the
world,'' Mrs. Abes said.
   Many out-of-town sightseers were flustered by the locked
museums, wondering out loud at signs that said, ``All Smithsonian
museums are closed today. We regret the inconvenience.''
   Friendly, informed tourists told them why, `Congress couldn't
pass its bill,'' they said, or ``The government's run out of
money.''
   Sightseers from around the globe felt the impact in New York,
when they trekked to lower Manhattan to catch ferries to Liberty
and Ellis Islands to see the Statue of Liberty, only to find the
boats weren't running.
   Helen Bealka, 62, traveled from St. Paul, Minn., to see Ellis
Island, where her father first set foot in America. ``This is
horrible. I don't know if I'll live long enough to come back,'' she
said.
   The nation's parks were affected, too, as rangers nationwide
began locking gates and closing down camp grounds when word was
dispatched from Washington that the federal government was out of
money.
   A bus load of tourists from Indiana drove six hours to reach the
Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee, only to be turned
away by rangers.
   ``It's really unfair to rub this in the people's face. This is
really not helping relations with the public. ... I just feel like
it's a political ploy,'' said Bob Davenport, leading the group from
Muncie, Ind.
   At the White House, the staff that serves the president's living
quarters - ushers, butlers, chefs, maids - has already been cut
from 70 to 10. ``We won't be having any big dinners around here,''
said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   John Sturdivant, president of the 700,000-member American
Federation of Government Employees, complained about Bush's choice
of words for explaining his veto of stopgap budget legislation that
would have ended the shutdown. The president apologized for any
``inconvenience'' that might have been caused.
   ``He should have said `I'm sorry for the disaster I've
caused,''' Sturdivant said. ``It's more than an inconvenience for
employees to be without a paycheck or go through two months of
anxiety about what's going to happen to them.''

   Space shuttle Discovery rocketed
into orbit Saturday, carrying Americans into space for the first
time in nearly six months and starting the robot craft Ulysses on a
five-year voyage of solar exploration.
   The five-man Discovery crew smoothly accomplished its primary
goal, casting off Ulysses exactly as planned. The probe then
rocketed itself out of Earth orbit.
   ``Good deploy, Houston,'' said mission commander Richard N.
Richards after the solar probe was freed from the shuttle.
``Ulysses is on its way.''
   ``That's a great job,'' Mission Control replied.
   Three rocket stages then fired automatically on Ulysses, and the
craft was accelerated out of Earth orbit at 34,130 mph, the fastest
speed ever for a manmade object.
   Mission Control told the astronauts that ground monitors in Guam
and Australia determined Ulysses was exactly where it should be,
indicating that the rocket stages fired as planned.
   ``Fantastic!'' exclaimed an astronaut from space.
   The atomic-powered solar explorer started its independent voyage
six hours after the shuttle was launched by dawn's early light.
Discovery roared from its seaside launch pad and climbed flawlessly
to a 184-mile-high orbit.
   Ulysses will follow a roundabout path, first cruising away from
the sun toward Jupiter. The powerful gravity pull of that giant
planet will act like a slingshot, accelerating the probe to an even
higher speed and sending it streaking back toward the sun.
   In 1994, Ulysses will pass over the sun's south pole, then curve
over the north solar pole. The sun's poles cannot be seen from
Earth and have never been explored.
   Because Ulysses is powered by a generator energized by more than
20 pounds of plutonium, anti-nuclear activists filed a lawsuit to
block the launch of the radioactive material. But a federal judge
ruled against their petition Friday. That same day, two of 20
anti-nuclear demonstrators were arrested at the Kennedy Space
Center.
   NASA staffers cheered as Discovery soared into space only 12
minutes later than the planned 7:35 a.m. launch time. The delay was
caused by a minor weather problem and a last-minute technical
glitch.
   Discovery's mission is scheduled to last four days with a
landing Wednesday in California. The launch wasn't affected by the
shutdown of many federal agencies because funds for the mission
already had been set aside, officials said.
   After the craft settled into orbit, Mission Control in Houston
told the astronauts: ``There are a lot of smiling faces down here
on the ground.''
   ``There's a lot of smiling faces up here, too,'' replied
Richards. ``You all did a great job getting us off the pad this
morning. We couldn't ask for anything better.''
   The launch came after months of frustation for NASA.
   A mysterious hydrogen fuel leak, still unsolved, forced a series
of launch cancellations for space shuttles Columbia and Atlantis.
NASA's last previous launch was April 24, when Discovery took off.
   Another embarrassment came over the summer when NASA engineers
learned that the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope had been
manufactured with an error that gives it a blurred view of the
universe. The error was not found until after it had been deployed
in space by Discovery last April.
   And last week, NASA was embarrassed again when workers left a
70-pound metal beam inside the engine compartment of Atlantis and
the beam caused some minor damage when it clanked around inside as
the spacecraft was lifted and rotated by a crane.
   The smooth launch on Saturday was a boost for NASA's morale,
said launch director Bob Sieck.
   ``We're obviously pleased,'' he said.
   The mood among space workers, he said, ``is one of euphoria or
relief. It's certainly good to be back ... on orbit. The team
worked real hard for this. They got their reward - finally.''
   Sieck said Discovery had only a few minor problems in its
countdown toward launch. He said the craft is ``the fleet leader
right now because it got us back to flight again.''
   Besides Richards, the crew members are pilot Robert D. Cabana
and mission specialists William M. Shepherd, Bruce Melnick and
Thomas D. Akers.

   President Bush, who rarely stays in town on
weekends, presided Saturday over an executive mansion darkened and
empty of tourists and where even finding someone to type up a veto
proved problematic.
   The president canceled a holiday weekend visit to his oceanside
home in Kennebunkport, Maine, and remained in Washington to keep
tabs on the federal budget stalemate.
   When Congress failed to produce a new budget agreement on
Friday, the government officially ran out of money and all
non-essential government services were shut down effective Saturday
at 12:01 a.m. EDT.
   Much of the White House also was shut down. Tours were canceled
Saturday and only a skeleton staff of aides and attendants were
allowed to come to work.
   But the president declared a defiant ``watch and learn'' when
asked how longhe was prepared to allow the government to remain
closed down to make his point with Congress.
   And he raised the stakes by vetoing a bill Congress had passed
the night before to avert a government shutdown.
   But since the bulk of Bush's clerical and press staff had been
deemed ``non-essential'' and told not to report to work, getting
the word out about the veto wasn't all that easy.
   Well, Bush conceded to reporters, ``it hasn't been vetoed yet.
Need a typewriter in there to get it done.''
   ``By the time we finish this press conference that has gone
longer than I thought, it'll probably be all typed up,'' he added.
   Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, explained later: ``We don't
have any secretaries around here'' - although he also said that he
thought the veto message had been typed the night before.
   Even Bush's news conference to announce the veto was unusual.
   The press briefing room, where he usually speaks with reporters,
was dark and empty. But the president had no problem finding
cameras and reporters.
   He walked outside the White House and stepped up to the battery
of microphones in the driveway from which congressional leaders had
just departed - including Democrats who blasted Bush for his veto
decision.
   It was the first time in recent memory that a president has held
a news conference in the driveway. Dozens of tourists, barred entry
to the White House because of the shutdown, pressed against the
fence along Pennsylvania Avenue to peer at the president and the
large crowd of reporters surrounding him.
   The rule that only essential government workers could remain on
the job apparently did not apply to presidential motorcades. Bush
took an 11-car procession to a church in the Georgetown section of
the city to attend the wedding the wedding of White House personnel
chief Chase Untermeyer.
   Since taking office in January 1989, Bush has only spent a
handful of weekends in the White House. Usually he spends Saturdays
and Sundays at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Md., or at
his vacation home in Maine.

   The budget crisis that has pitted the
executive branch against the legislative branch, the president
against Congress and Democrats against Republicans is grounded in
years of government infighting over how best to cope with steadily
rising federal deficits.
   Here are answers to some of questions most frequently asked
about the impact of budget stalemate on the American people and
their lives:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Why has the federal government been forced to start shutting
down?
   A: Because the budget dispute prevented enactment of any of the
13 regular appropriations bills for fiscal 1991, the federal budget
year that began Oct. 1. The Constitution states that ``No money
shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of
appropriations made by law.'' While some appropriations are in
permanent law, most day-to-day government operations are renewed
annually in one or another of the 13 appropriations bills.
   What that means is that government agencies are not allowed to
spend money, including salaries, purchases and so forth, unless
there is a law authorizing them to spend money. Since there wasn't
even a stopgap law in place Saturday, the agencies were legally
required to send people home and close down.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Has this ever happened before?
   A: Yes. The government was forced to shut down temporarily three
times in the past decade due to squabbles between the
administration and Congress over the budget.
   The government closed briefly in November 1981 when an estimated
400,000 employees were dismissed at midday after President Reagan
vetoed an emergency money bill. On October 4, 1984, about 500,000
government workers were sent home by Congress' failure to approve
an appropriations bill.
   On October 16, 1986, the government sent 500,000 non-essential
employees home at midday, but Congress later in the day passed an
appropriations bill acceptable to Reagan and workers were ordered
to report on their next shift.
   Congress, as it had done in 1981 and 1984, passed a resolution
ordering that employees furloughed get their regular salaries
anyway.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: What is this ``Gramm-Rudman Act'' I keep hearing so much
about and why was it passed?
   A: Congress enacted the law, named for Sens. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, and Warren Rudman, R-N.H., in 1985 and revised it in 1987.
Some refer to it as ``Gramm-Rudman-Hollings,'' to reflect that Sen.
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., played a role in its creation.
   Passage of the law, in effect, was a legislative admission of
failure - a recognition by members of the House and Senate that
they could not make the tough choices necessary to staunch the flow
of government red ink without a threat hanging over them.
   The law requires Congress and the president to reduce the
deficit to predetermined annual targets, leading eventually to a
balanced budget. Gramm-Rudman requires across-the-board spending
cuts to make up the difference if those targets are missed. The
target for fiscal 1991 is $64 billion but the president's estimates
are so far above that number that Bush and Congress agree it is
impossible to reach. They will change it to a much higher number -
if they agree on an overall budget package.
   The result will be to delay the goal of a balanced budget
probably until 1996 or beyond.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: What events prompted the current shutdown?
   A: On Sept. 30, the last day of fiscal 1990, Bush and the
bipartisan congressional leadership announced agreement on a
five-year, $500 billion deficit-reduction package that included
approximately $134 billion in new taxes. Congress passed and Bush
signed a one week temporary appropriations bill to keep the
government operating while Congress passed the plan. Bush went on
national television Tuesday night to appeal for congressional
support of the package, but it was voted down Thursday night.
   Members of the House and Senate approved another stopgap
spending measure, known as a ``continuing resolution'' on Friday.
That would have kept the government running until next Friday, Oct.
12, and would have given lawmakers another week's time to arrive at
a budget consensus. But Bush vetoed that bill Saturday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: How will the shutdown affect my life. Can I still catch my
flight, for example?
   A: The government began closing so-called ``non-essential''
facilities Saturday, but air traffic controllers are among those
considered essential. Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Bob
Buckhorn says those ``essential services remain in place'' at air
control towers. However, if the deadlock persisted, there would be
a reduction in the number of controllers allowed to work.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: What is meant by ``essential'' and ``non-essential?''
   A: Each agency decides what is an essential service. But,
generally, staying on the job will be workers dealing with national
security, health, emergency and similar things. The military, air
traffic controllers, border guards, medical institution personnel
and prison guards will be unaffected. Federal meat and poultry
inspection will continue during a general shutdown.

<HEAD>U.S. Issues New Travel Warnings on Middle East</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department advised U.S. citizens on
Saturday to avoid traveling to the Israeli-occupied territories
because of ``recurrent disturbances and increased tensions'' in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   The department also warned travelers to the Middle East, South
Asia and North Africa of possible anti-American demonstrations
arising from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Travelers and residents throughout the region should exercise
caution and contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate to
register their presence and receive information on the local
situation,'' the warning said.
   The pair of warnings marked the second time in a week - and the
third time since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 - that the State
Department has warned Americans against traveling in regions
because of Persian Gulf tensions.
   The separate travel warning on the Israeli territories said
Middle East events ``have sparked anti-American sentiments and
threats in the territories.''
   The department said there have been disturbances in East
Jerusalem and warned Americans planning to travel there to check
with the American Consulate for an update on conditions.
   Security has been tightened in the territories and the State
Department warned that tourists may be subject to strict and
lengthy searches.
   The department also noted Israel, which has feared Iraq's
chemical warfare capabilities, is distributing gas masks to
citizens starting Oct. 14.
   ``Americans should take this into account in planning to visit
Israel,'' the travel warning said.

<HEAD>Contacts Under Way for Resuming Relief Flights in Sudan</HEAD>

   U.N. officials have resumed contacts with
the military government aimed at resuming relief flights to
rebel-held areas in southern Sudan, a U.N. relief official said
Saturday.
   Trover Page, director of the World Food Program and
representative of the U.N. secretary-general, called this week's
government decision to lift the ban on the food shipments
``extremely good news.''
   Figures released recently by the United Nation in New York
indicate famine threatens up to one-fifth of Sudan's 25 million
people.
   ``Much of the Sudan is affected,'' Page said. ``It is much more
than that . . . Much of Sudan faces food scarcity at the time.''
   Page said he would not call it famine but ``serious food
shortage.''
   Sudan's military leader, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan El-Bashir, last
weekend banned Red Cross and U.N. relief flights to south Sudan,
where the Sudan People's Liberation Army holds most the three
provinces except for some garrison towns.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar confronted
el-Bashir about the ban during meetings in New York this week.
   El-Bashir's foreign minister, Ali Sahloul, later said mercy
flights would resume.
   The rebels took up arms in 1983 to demand greater autonomy and
economic and administrative reforms.

<HEAD>Veterans Cry Shame on Proposed Home Closing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLYOKE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At 100 years old, Ethel Pierce hasn't
forgotten nursing ``the boys'' of World War I, sometimes filling
out night reports with her feet propped up on a water pail to stop
the rats from running up her legs.
   Now it's time for her government to remember, says Pierce, who
like most residents of the Holyoke Soldiers Home doesn't know where
she'll go after April 1, the date the facility is scheduled to
close because of state budget cuts.
   ``It's a shame,'' she said. ``We went (to war) and we didn't
know whether we'd get back or not.''
   Leaving the Holyoke home, perched on a hilltop that overlooks
the wooded Connecticut Valley, would mean losing contact with
family and friends, veterans said.
   ``This is a lovely place,'' said Pierce, who from her
fourth-floor room looks out on a view many hotels would envy, a sea
of dark-green pines flecked with the russets of maple as fall
foliage season approached.
   The cuts, part of a $310 million reduction announced by Gov.
Michael Dukakis on Sept. 25, set closing dates for the Holyoke
home, another Soldiers Home in Chelsea and several Boston shelters,
including a place for homeless veterans recognized by President
Bush's ``thousand points of light'' program.
   Since that announcement, state officials said they will keep the
homes and shelters open if the Legislature approves alternative
cuts.
   The uncertainty hasn't been good for veterans' peace of mind,
said Holyoke Soldiers Home Superintendent Rudolph Chmura.
   ``You're up high one minute and you're down low. These people
are on medical treatment, they don't need that,'' he said.
   Veterans said they're not asking for a handout.
   ``I wonder what the thoughts are of a recruiter today ... if he
were to tell that (recruit), `I am sorry, but by the time you're 65
you'll have to find your own way, so be careful,''' said
75-year-old John Landers, who lost both legs as a result of
injuries he suffered when a tank caught fire.
   David Joyce, 80, and a member of the Holyoke home's Board of
Trustees who is staying temporarily at the facility for medical
treatment, called the closing an ``absolute disgrace'' and said he
doubts putting residents in a nursing home will save the state any
money.
   The state has always owned and operated the Holyoke home. Many
of its 245 residents would end up in nursing homes, where the state
would still be responsible for half of the cost of their care
through the Medicaid program.
   ``My wife's in a nursing home that costs $110 a day. I figure at
the end of a year our resources and whatever else we had will be
gone, maybe,'' he said.
   Chelsea veterans were equally dismayed to hear of the closing
date, which would displace 450 people, said Paul McNamara,
assistant superintendent.
   Dukakis has said he had no choice but to make the cuts because
he has the power to withhold money only from executive agencies. He
said he will ask the Legislature, the courts and the constitutional
officers to make further cuts in their budgets, which would free
$13 million for human service programs, including the $5 million
needed to keep the soldiers homes open.
   State officials denied that veterans are pawns in a political
power play.
   ``It's unfortunately the nature of reality,'' said Dukakis
spokesman Steve Crawford. ``Over the last 14 months we've cut $100
million a month from the state budget.''
   Meanwhile, the veterans wait.
   Pierce, her face furrowed by the lines of a century, set her
chin resolutely at the thought of leaving the Holyoke home where
she has lived for 14 years.
   Her eyes, magnified by thick glasses, flickered with mischief as
she recalled the days of 1917 when she dodged the wrath of a
supervisor - ``Lord knows what war she was in before'' - and joked
with the British soldiers sent to her field hospital in France.
   ``I said I'd go wherever necessary with `the boys,''' she said.
``We didn't know whether we'd be bombed or not, but we went just
the same.''

   Saddam Hussein is moving so many Iraqi citizens
into Kuwait that its population might choose to remain under
Baghdad's rule even after Saddam removed his troops, Israeli

   Iraq has been transferring its citizens into Kuwait steadily
since the invasion, the officials said.
   An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said 50 percent of the emirate's population at the
moment ``are not Kuwaitis.'' He gave no further details.
   ``This phenomena certainly exists, and the longer it goes on,
the more irreversible the annexation becomes,'' said Yossi Olmert,
head of the Government Press Office.
   The replacement of Kuwaitis by Iraqi citizens has been easy for
Iraq because many Kuwaiti citizens were abroad on summer vacations
during Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion and have not returned to the occupied
country, Olmert said.
   Following the population transfer, Saddam ``may offer, at a
certain stage, an arrangement involving elections on the basis of
the population existing in Kuwait,'' Olmert said.
   A similar assessment was made by Housing Minister Ariel Sharon,
who as defense minister led Israel in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
   In a recent television interview, Sharon said one-third of
Kuwaiti residents have been replaced with ``Iraqis and
Palestinians, or Jordanians of Palestinian origin.''
   ``So a day can come and Saddam can offer a political solution: I
withdraw from Kuwait, you withdraw from the Gulf and Saudi Arabia,
and there will be a plebiscite in Kuwait. And we know what this
plebiscite would show,'' Sharon said.
   Olmert said he could not estimate how many Iraqis had been moved
in, whether it ``concerned 40, 50 or 60 percent'' of Kuwait's
population.
   There was no independent confirmation of the Israeli claims.
Even before the invasion less than half the residents of Kuwait
were Kuwaitis.
   Kuwait's population was estimated at 1.7 to 1.8 million at the
time of the Iraqi invasion, including about one million expatriate
workers.
   Of the 800,000 Kuwaitis, about 300,000 are believed still inside
the occupied country. The others fled after the invasion, most to
Saudi Arabia where the ousted emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah,
has set up a government-in-exile.
   The English-language daily Jerusalem Post newspaper, in a Sept.
27 editorial titled ``Palestinizing Kuwait,'' also discussed the
issue.
   ``The Palestinians have expropriated the registration records of
the (Kuwaiti) interior ministry and handed them over to the
Iraqis,'' it said.
   Olmert said Kuwait's Interior Ministry, and all its documents,
was under Iraqi control.
   ``Thousands of Palestinians with their families and belongings
are being resettled in abandoned homes, and whole neighborhoods are
now inhabited exclusively by Iraqis and Palestinians, who carry
Kuwaiti identity papers produced with confiscated Kuwaiti
equipment,'' the Post said.
   ``It will not be long before the only genuine Kuwaitis with
allegiance to the exiled emir will themselves be living in exile
too, if they are living at all.''

<HEAD>Burma Military Rebuffs Calls for Democracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling military council has rebuffed
foreign criticism and announced it will continue martial law in
Burma as long as it sees fit.
   ``It is unacceptable for foreign countries at this delicate and
sensitive stage and time of transition to exert unwarranted and
unjust pressure on the nation,'' said a government statement,
distributed to diplomatic missions Friday and broadcast on state
radio.
   Most Western governments suspended aid to Burma after the
military brutally seized power in September 1988. The military has
refused to transfer power to a democratic coalition that won
elections held in May.
   Government troops raided the West German, British and U.S.
embassies late last month and detained Burmese employees of Western
missions.
   The government on Thursday rejected Frederick Vreeland as the
new U.S. ambassador after he criticized Burmese human rights
conditions and other policies at his confirmation hearings in
Washington.
   ``Whatever external pressure is exerted, the (ruling council)
will continue to shoulder the task that has been set out,'' the
government statement said.``Such pressure by a minority of
countries can only be detrimental to the interests of these
countries.''
   ``Should it be deemed necessary, the (ruling council) will
continue to exercise martial law until such time that a firm,
constitutionally established government has come into being,'' the
statement said.
   The military has said it will make unspecified constitutional
changes before stepping down or allowing democratic rule.

   Gus, a 4-month-old Canada goose, helps
cut the grass, visits the neighbors and sometimes flies after the
school bus.
   ``He's the original party animal,'' says Bill Carson, who
adopted Gus from friends who hatched the goose on their water
heater.
   Gus will accompany anyone on a walk to get the newspaper. He
helps mow the grass by eating clippings sprayed from the mower and
sometimes chases the school bus when his friend Ryan Thigpen, 11,
leaves in the morning.
   Gus flies beside the bus, looking in the window. Carson -
fearful the goose will be hit by a car - is trying to break Gus of
that habit.
   Content to live with humans, Gus ignores a large flock of Canada
geese living in a small lake in Carson's back yard. He also ignores
Dudley, a domestic gray goose who passes the day staring at his
reflection in the shiny chrome bumper of Carson's truck.
   About five months ago, a Doberman pinscher found an egg near the
Harpeth River in Franklin, about 20 miles south of Nashville, said
Diane Frazier.
   ``My uncle's dog, Duchess, was playing with the egg in the yard
for some time,'' Frazier said. ``My uncle thought it was a
baseball.''
   Her husband, Mike Frazier, rescued the egg, put it in a paper
bag and placed it on the water heater, turning it once a day until
Gus hatched.
   The Fraziers, who live in downtown Franklin, soon decided Gus
would be happier in the country and gave him to their friend
Carson, who lives in this small town about 10 miles east of
Franklin.

   On a day when the doors were closed at the
Smithsonian museums and the White House gates were locked, the best
show in town on a sunny Saturday was at the Capitol - and it didn't
cost a dime.
   Tourists who normally would have streamed into the National Air
and Space Museum to see Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis or
stood in long lines to ogle the lower reaches of the White House
instead found all the action was in Congress, where an unusually
bitter budget fight was being waged with President Bush.
   They piled into elevators and rode to the third floor House and
Senate visitor galleries. And then they waited for their chance to
be admitted to hear the verbal jousting over the budget crisis that
had begun to shut down some segments of the government.
   The show was worth it.
   Mouths hung agape in the Senate as Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
exclaimed: ``I'm surprised we have electricity in this room and
anybody attending to this chamber so we can stand here and argue
about this.''
   Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., thought President Bush had gone too
far in vetoing a stopgap spending bill that would have postponed
the government shutdown for a week.
   ``It was a childish act, a temper tantrum,'' Sanford declared.
   People bent forward, craning their necks, as Sen. Wendell Ford,
D-Ky., observed: ``I think everything is closed except this place,
and the admission here is free.''
   ``They're all here because the other zoo is closed,'' said Rep.
Charles Wilson, D-Texas, motioning toward the public galleries in
the House.
   In both the House and Senate, member after member got up to 1)
excoriate the president; 2) assail a colleague; and 3) engage in
public self-flagellation about governmental ineptitude.
   ``Vote! Vote! Vote!'' a large number of lawmakers chanted as
patience wore thin.
   It was something akin to the British House of Commons, where
roars of approval or disapproval are accepted as common practice.
   Through the hallways, in the elevators and behind the counters
in the snack shops, congressional aides groused about working on
Saturday. In the Senate carry-out, visitors opted mostly for coffee
and Cokes, eschewing the day's special - New Orleans-style fish and
pasta.
   Outside, tourists leaving the show backtracked along the East
Front parking lot to get a fuller view of the majestic Capitol
Dome, looming high above the building, magnificently oblivious to
the uproar below.

<HEAD>Romania To Fire Industry Managers, End Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economics Minister Eugen Dijmarescu
said Saturday that the government has decided to fire thousands of
managers of Romania's huge, largely failing state-owned industries.
   He also said most subsidies for consumer goods will be abolished
soon to bring their prices in line with real market values.
   Officials hope that will restore the stocks of state-owned
stores, which have been depleted by speculators reselling the goods
on the black market at higher prices.
   Dijmarescu said the government will try to cushion inflationary
pressures with measures aimed at increasing productivity, which
officials estimate dropped by about 20 percent over the past year.
   Among the measures will be reorganizing and privatizing most
industries on the basis of ``competence and competitiveness,'' he
said. That will include firing thousands of managers elected by
workers' committees following the December revolution that toppled
the Communist dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The minister said most of these managers ``act like union
representatives'' and do not understand that the government no
longer sees itself responsible for providing industry with raw
materials and financing their losses.
   ``Probably 60 to 70 percent of the existing managers will be
replaced . . . by a new leadership named on the basis of competence
. . . people who will make sure the factories produce more, and
enough to pay salaries,'' he said in an interview.
   Dijmarescu said pending laws would link salaries to output. Once
the Romanian currency, the leu, is convertible, ``production will
also be stimulated by the competition from foreign firms,'' he
said.
   The government plans to devalue the leu to achieve
convertibility, he said.
   The official exchange rate is 20 leu to the dollar, but the
black market rate exceeds 100. In Munich, Germany, the leu is
bought at 216 to the dollar.
   Dijmarescu said while the governing National Salvation Front won
the May elections on a platform proposing ``transition through
small steps . . . the government is proposing a program of shock
therapy, and has been approved by Parliament.''
   The government decided last week to halt credit lines to failing
industries and to impose special taxes on industrial use of
electric energy. It will eliminate energy subsidies to most
industries.
   The measures were designed to assure the more than 23 million
Romanians sufficent heating and lighting in the coming winter.
Ceausescu, who was executed Dec. 25, allowed factories to keep
operating even when power was cut off to homes.
   The country's economic problems have been aggravated by a
reduction in energy imports from the Soviet Union and by Iraq's
cutoff of $1.7 billion in debt repayments, which were to be made
partially in the form of cheap gasoline. Iraq announced it would
not pay the debt after Romania supported U.N. economic sanctions
over the invasion of Kuwait.
   On Saturday, about 400 demonstrators marched through the capital
shouting slogans against President Ion Iliescu and demanding the
release of what they said were political prisoners.
   The demonstration was organized by four small opposition parties
- the Free Republican Party, the Christian-Democratic Union, the
Christian National Democratic Party, and the Independent Peasants
Party of Craiova.
   Nica Leon, a leader of the Free Republicans, said, ``We are
expressing our opposition to the abusive arrests and the inhuman
conditions suffered in prison by those who opposed Iliescu.''
   Iliescu and his National Salvation Front came to power after the
revolution and were confirmed in the May elections. The government
has used force to break up some demonstrations since then.

   The accident occurred in clear weather in a wooded area near Bad

   Officials said the balloon lost altitude as a result of the
burner failure, whose cause wasn't known. The gondola grazed
treetops and then flipped over and fell onto a road.
   It was Austria's worst ballooning accident. In July 1968, three

<HEAD>Judge Orders Navy To Temporarily Stop Killing Squirrels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An animal rights group has won a court
order against a Navy program to kill squirrels at a weapons
station. The group claims the chemical bait used also threatens
endangered species.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson on Friday granted a
temporary restraining order to the Contra Costa County chapter of
In Defense of Animals.
   The group sued the Navy in federal court, contending a squirrel
control program was started at the Concord Naval Weapons Station
without an environmental impact report.
   Contra Costa County paid for half the poisoned grain but was not
named in the lawsuit. The county has sponsored an eradication
program for years that has not been challenged in court.
   The Navy began the eradication program Monday because neighbors
of the base complained squirrels were damaging property and
buildings and because the animals burrowed into ammunition bunkers,
said Assistant U.S. Attorney James Coda, respresenting the Navy.
   About five tons of oats containing the anticoagulant
chlorophacinone were spread over 800 acres of the Navy's
12,900-acre station north of Concord before the ban was imposed.
   The animal rights group claims the poison threatens endangered
species that live in in the area east of San Francisco Bay, such as
the San Joaquin kit fox and salt harvest mouse.
   Predatory birds such as owls and golden eagles also could die
after eating the poisoned squirrels, said Maryanne Britten, an
attorney for the group.
   The temporary ban lasts until Oct. 22, when Henderson will hold
another hearing to decide whether to extend it.
   In Defense of Animals also contend the program is cruel because
the poison causes the California ground squirrels to bleed
internally and die slowly, said spokeswoman Jean Bonadio.
   Henderson ordered the group to raise a $10,000 bond by early
next week as a condition of granting the temporary stay. The bond
would cover the Navy's losses if the animals rights group fails to
win its case.
   The Navy paid Contra Costa County $10,000 for the poisoned
grain. Since last May, the county has sold the bait to landowners
at a 50 percent price discount. Before that, it provided the
poisoned grain for free, but began sharing the cost because of
increased requests.
   John Defremery, the county's agricultural commissioner, said
about 35 tons of poisoned oats have been used on about 35,000 acres
of county rangeland this year.

   European and NASA officials exuded joy
Saturday after the shuttle Discovery launched the Ulysses probe
they control from California on ``a great adventure'' to explore
the sun's poles.
   ``I've never enjoyed an experience like I've enjoyed this one.
... Never have I known you could feel so good for so long,'' said
Willis Meeks, Ulysses project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Derek Eaton, Ulysses project manager for the European Space
Agency, declared: ``Welcome to sunny California. It's a sunny day
for me today.''
   Discovery lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., Saturday
morning. Six hours later, Ulysses was deployed from the shuttle's
cargo bay. In the next 83 minutes, three rocket stages boosted
Ulysses out of Earth orbit, starting it on a roundabout, five-year
mission to explore the sun's polar regions at a cost of $750
million.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Deep Space
Network tracking station in Canberra, Australia, picked up Ulysses'
signal at 12:18 p.m. PDT. The spacecraft seemed to be ``in perfect
working order,'' Eaton said.
   Ulysses is a joint project of NASA and ESA. The Europeans will
control Ulysses from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, while NASA
officials will provide tracking and other ground support.
   Ulysses' voyage will take it past Jupiter in February 1992, when
it will use that planet as a ``gravity slingshot'' to become the
first spacecraft to fly a path perpendicular to the plane in which
the planets orbit the sun.
   That will allow Ulysses to pass over the sun's south polar
regions during May-September 1994 and over the north polar
latitudes during May-September 1995.
   ``This is a great adventure in virgin territory,'' said Edgar
Page, ESA's Ulysses science coordinator.
   Yet Ulysses will never get closer to the sun than when it was
launched from the shuttle. At its closest approach, Ulysses will be
120 million miles from the sun. Earth is 93 million miles from the
sun.
   Page said there is no need for Ulysses to get any closer to
achieve its goal of studying the sun's high latitudes.
   To send the spacecraft closer would have raised difficult design
problems since Ulysses would have to withstand intense solar heat
but also survive deep cold near Jupiter.
   Because no spacecraft ever has studied the sun's high latitudes,
``our present understanding of the sun could be compared to trying
to make a map of the Earth by flying an airplane around the
equator,'' ESA said in a news release.
   Ulysses carries nine scientific instruments, and its radio will
conduct two other studies. The experiments will study solar wind,
cosmic rays and dust, gamma rays, X-rays, solar magnetic fields and
a vast array of energetic particles spewed by the sun.
   ESA said: ``There is no body in heaven as important to us as the
sun. Even a tiny change in its health could cause an ice age or
could melt the ice caps, flooding the coasts of the world. ...
Variations in solar cycles have had an impact on the radical
climate changes seen in the past.''
   Willy Brado, ESA's assistant director for operations, said
Saturday's launch will help restore the confidence of European
governments in manned space flights for deploying scientific
spacecraft.
   ``If this had failed, it would have had repercussions at ESA,''
he said.

   Armed men ambushed four Red Cross workers on a
relief mission in northern Somalia on Saturday, the International
Committee of the Red Cross said. It said one worker was killed and
the three others are missing.
   The all-Swiss ICRC said Swiss Red Cross delegate Peter Altwegg
was taken to the town of Hargeisa, mortally wounded, and died
there. It said it had no word on what happened to another Swiss
citizen, Antonella Notari, or to two members of the Somalian Red
Cross, Sahra Ahmed Jama, president of the Hargeisa branch, and
Hassan Arab.
   There was no word on who attacked the group. The rebel Somalia
National Movement has been fighting in the area since 1988 against
the government of Somaila. Plain banditry is also a problem in the
Horn of Africa country.
   The ICRC said both government and rebel representatives had been
told of the relief mission and agreed to it. The relief workers
were ambushed about 18 miles from Hargeisa, it said.

<TEXT>
   Students at the University of the District of
Columbia Saturday relinquished control of an administrative
building and ended a 10-day protest after school officials agreed
to most of their demands.
   Following several all-day negotiation sessions, the board agreed
to 35 of 44 demands, including amnesty for the activists, student
leader Mark Thompson said.
   The students took over a campus services building on Sept. 26 to
press their demands for improvements in academic and athletic
programs and the resignation of the 11 members of the 15-member
board of trustees appointed by Washington Mayor Marion Barry.
   As many as 500 students occupied the building during the
protest, which forced cancellation of classes for several days on
the northwest Washington campus.
   Thompson said students compromised on the final demand that the
11 trustees resign. The trustees had said their resignation would
create confusion at the campus of 12,000 and do more harm than
good.
   A city council committee is expected to consider a bill that
would increase board membership to 21 including two students.
   Barry, who earlier abandoned negotiations with the students
because of the lack of progress, told a gathering of students and
school and city officials Saturday that all sides would benefit
from the strike.
   ``This is a historic and proud moment in the history of UDC. UDC
is and will become an even a greater university because of what our
students did and what they did and stood for,'' said the mayor.
   Both trustees and students pledged they would continue to try to
improve student services and provide a better education at the
city-subsidized institution.
   The pact does not include any immediate changes. Committees of
students and administrators are to be set up to examine such issues
as constructing a student union and creating a computerized music
library.

<HEAD>`20-20' Admits `Buckwheat' Was an Impostor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The executive producer of ABC's ``20-20''
acknowledged Saturday that the television show was duped by an
impostor claiming to be Buckwheat from the classic ``Our Gang''
comedies.
   William ``Billy'' Thomas, the actor who played Buckwheat, died
nearly a decade ago.
   On ``20-20'' Friday night, Hugh Downs narrated a segment in
which the series claimed to have found Buckwheat working as a
grocery bagger in Tempe, Ariz. The impostor, Bill English, said he
had changed his last name from Thomas and refused to sign
autographs because it would interfere with his work.
   ``20-20'' spokeswoman Maurie Perl said Saturday that Thomas'
obituaries proved English was a fake and the show would apologize
during its next broadcast Friday.
   ``(Executive producer Victor Neufeld) feels indeed there was a
lapse in the research done by the production team and we may very
well have made a mistake,'' Ms. Perl said. ``Obviously we are upset
and dismayed with the mistake.''
   Thomas' friends and family said they were angry the impostor
received a national television audience.
   Thomas died Oct. 10, 1980, of a heart attack at age 49, said his
son, William Thomas Jr. of Covina, Calif.
   The elder Thomas appeared in 89 ``Our Gang'' films, starting in
1934 - when he was 3 years old - until the series ended in 1944.
   ``I just can't believe `20-20' didn't investigate this better.
I'm somewhat dumbfounded by the whole thing,'' Bill Thomas said
Saturday.
   ``We did not mean to cause any pain or unpleasantness for any of
Buckwheat's family or friends,'' Ms. Perl said. ``With regard to
the production team, obviously they will be reprimanded and that
will be handled internally.'' Thomas, who runs Buckwheat
Enterprises and makes a living licensing the character, said
impostors threaten his business. He has filed several lawsuits to
protect the name.
   George McFarland, 62, the child star who played Buckwheat's
sidekick Spanky, said he spoke Saturday with Neufeld and the
producer ``was terribly concerned about what had happened.''
McFarland, who lives in Fort Worth, said he too has been dogged by
impostors.
   Richard W. Bann, who co-wrote the 1976 book ``Our Gang, the Life
and Times of the Little Rascals,'' with Leonard Maltin, said the
error hurt the ABC news magazine show's credibility.
   ``What kind of research is this? You would think that at this
level of investigative reporting, you would catch something like
this,'' he said from his Los Angeles home. ``It sort of undermines
anything you'll ever see on that show again. And next week, they'll
find Elvis.''
   A Tempe viewer suggested the profile, said Ms. Perl.
   ``I don't believe in the 12 years of the broadcast we have ever
had such a problem and we will without question tighten all
research and review processes,'' she said.
   The ``Our Gang'' series, which included 221 short films and one
of feature length, began in 1922 with the dual billing: ``Hal Roach
presents his Rascals in their latest Our Gang comedy titled ...''
   The term ``Little'' was added to ``Rascals'' when the films were
broadcast on television beginning in 1955.
   The series starred several child actors, including Robert Blake

<HEAD>First Snow in Rockies; Northeast Basks in Summery Weather</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The first snow of the season fell in the Rockies Saturday, while
a cold front moving across the Plains into the northern Midwest
brought summerlike conditions to the Northeast.
   As much as 7 inches of snow had accumulated Saturday morning in
the northern and western mountains of Wyoming, and snow was
scattered over the mountains of western Montana and northern Idaho.
   In the northern Black Hills in South Dakota, 3 to 6 inches of
snow was expected to accumulate overnight. Snow over the Black
Hills on Saturday morning changed to scattered showers.
   Advisories were posted for freezing temperatures Saturday night
over North Dakota, western and northern South Dakota, Minnesota and
Upper Michigan. Freezing temperatures also were expected Sunday
morning in western Idaho.
   Temperatures dipped into the low 20s in parts of Colorado,
Idaho, Wyoming and Montana.
   Winds up to 35 mph buffeted parts of the California deserts, and
winds gusted to 45 mph in the southeast highlands of Idaho.
   Rain and occasional thunderstorms ranged along the Gulf Coast
from Texas to Florida.
   The cold front moving into the northern Midwest created high
pressure in the Mid-Atlantic region, and the Northeast basked in
temperatures reaching into the mid-80s.
   Hartford, Conn., recorded 86 degrees in the early afternoon,
tying its high for the date set in 1959. Boston reached 86 degrees,
tying a record high for the date set in 1946.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 states was 22 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo., and Kalispell, Mont.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 31
degrees at both Gillette, Wyo., and Livingston, Mont., to 98
degrees at Harlingen, Texas.
   Hurricane Klaus weakened to a tropical storm on Saturday and
drifted into the open waters of the Atlantic.
   The Caribbean island of Martinique was by far the hardest hit by
the storm. Heavy rain since Tuesday spawned landslides and serious
flooding that left at least six people dead and 1,500 homeless.

   Here is the 260-138 roll call Saturday by
which the House, by six votes, fell short of the two-thirds
majority needed to override President Bush's veto of a measure that
would have provided money to reopen shut down government agencies
for one week.
   A ``yes'' vote is a vote to override the veto.
   Voting yes were 235 Democrats and 25 Republicans.
   Voting no were 9 Democrats and 129 Republicans.
   X denotes those not voting.
   Present denotes those who voted they were ``present'' at the
time of the vote but did not vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on the issue.
   There is one vacancy in the 435-member House.

   Mormon Church President Ezra Taft Benson
remained in serious but stable condition Saturday as the church's
faithful met for their 160th semi-annual General Conference.
   An LDS Hospital nursing supervisor said the condition of the
leader of the 7.5 million-member Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints was unchanged.
   Benson underwent surgery last month to remove blood clots from
his brain and from gastrointestinal bleeding discovered last week.
He was hospitalized Sept. 18 after complaining of severe headaches
and difficulty swallowing.
   The 91-year-old Benson's condition had been upgraded to fair and
he was moved out of the intensive care unit and into a hospital
room Sept. 28, but he was moved back into intensive care two days
later when doctors discovered gastrointestinal bleeding.
   This weekend, thousands of church members from throughout the
world met in the Tabernacle on Salt Lake City's historic Temple
Square for the two-day conference.

   A senior British official said
Saturday he foresaw no problems of coordination between U.S.
Marines and a British armored unit soon to be placed under the
Marines' operational control.
   ``We wouldn't anticipate any great trouble there,'' Armed Forces
Minister Archibald Hamilton told a news conference. Compatible
equipment, including communications gear, is ``one advantage of
working with our NATO allies,'' he said.
   Britain's 7th Armored Brigade, with about 7,000 troops and 120
advanced Challenger tanks, is being shifted from its base in
Germany in the biggest movement of British armored forces since
World War II. The unit is named the Desert Rats for its legacy of
battle in North Africa.
   Hamilton, the second-ranking official in the British Defense
Ministry, said he expected the brigade to be in place by early
November, alongside U.S. Marine units that have been in the country
for six weeks.
   U.S. officials here have refused to comment on the arrangement.
   Hamilton said the combining of the two forces has been proposed
by American commanders, who were ``very glad when they heard the
7th Armored Brigade was coming.''
   ``In fact, they said they would like to see 7th Brigade
enhancing the capability of the Marines, and that's where we seem
to fit in most neatly.''
   The Challenger tanks, equipped with 120mm guns and what British
experts claim is the world's best armor, are more modern than the
Marines' M-60 tanks.
   ``It is certainly up to anything that the Iraqis can field. It
is superior to anything the Iraqis have,'' Hamilton said.
   He acknowledged the Challenger had been plagued with
difficulties but said there was no basis for reports that they
would be used only as ``static artillery'' to support Marine
operations.
   The current British deployment, which includes aircraft,
warships and 5,000 personnel, is costing a million pounds ($1.91
million) a day and that will double when the armored brigade
arrives, Hamilton said.
   He said there was ``an argument'' between the Defense Ministry
and the British Treasury on how the costs are to be covered, but
discussions were under way toward getting the Saudi government to
underwrite some of the cost, as it has done with the U.S. forces.

<HEAD>Panic Ends As Gasoline Regulation Starts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NADIA RYBAROVA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities began a form of
gasoline rationing on Saturday to deal with dwindling supplies of
Soviet oil as winter approaches.
   The new regulations, which took effect at midnight Friday, limit
drivers to 25 liters, or about six gallons, of gasoline in October
at the official price of about $3 a gallon. Any amount above the
limit carries about a $1 surcharge per gallon. New limits for
November were to be announced later.
   For three days before the rationing went into effect, drivers
overwhelmed filling stations, trying to buy as much gasoline as
possible. Some slept in their cars overnight waiting for the
stations to open.
   Panic buying started Wednesday night after announcements that
Czechoslovak leaders were seeking urgent talks with Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev and Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov about
Soviet oil supplies.
   The price of gasoline already increased by 50 percent in July
because of dwindling supplies from the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet Union, for years the main supplier of subsidized oil
to Czechoslovakia and its East European neighbors, has been unable
to fulfill quotas. It will begin demanding convertible currency for
the oil starting next year.
   Many of the countries in Eastern Europe also have lost supplies
of Iraqi oil beccause of their support for the U.N. sanctions
against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Their fragile economies are
facing much higher prices on the world market.
   Economics Minister Vladimir Dlouhy estimated last week that
Czechoslovakia would lose about $1.4 billion in extra fuel costs as
a result of the gulf crisis.
   Soviet authorities said earlier they would reduce oil allotments
for Czechoslovakia, originally set at 16.6 million tons for 1990,
by an estimated 2.6 million. But Czechoslovak authorities say the
cuts are even greater.

<HEAD>Researcher: Many Lockerbie Victims May Have Lived Until Impact</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The pilot and at least 147 other victims of
the Lockerbie disaster may have survived the bomb blast that ripped
the plane apart at 31,000 feet and died when they hit the ground, a
forensic pathologist said.
   ``And there's a good possibility they were conscious,'' said Dr.
William G. Eckert, director of the Milton Helpern International
Center of Forensic Sciences at Wichita State University. Eckert has
performed thousands of autopsies and consulted on hundreds of cases
involving medical-legal issues.
   Pan Am Flight 103 was ripped apart by a bomb on Dec. 21, 1988,
over southern Scotland. Whether any of the 259 victims survived the
fall to the ground could be a crucial point in lawsuits seeking
payment for the victims' pain and suffering.
   Eckert said the 148 Lockerbie victims who landed on or near
Tundergoth Hill may have lost consciousness because of lack of
oxygen when the Boeing 747 exploded but would have revived at about
15,000 to 10,000 feet.
   He said the victims would have been aware of what was happening
for the final third of their 36-second fall.
   Eckert said testimony Thursday at a public inquiry in Dumfries,
Scotland, supported his opinions. A rescuer said she found a young
woman who had a weak but regular pulse shortly after the bodies
rained from the sky.
   In a memo to Scottish police investigator John Orr, Eckert said
several of the passengers apparently had prepared for their deaths.
Some clutched crosses or crucifixes and one woman held her baby
tight.
   A woman aboard a Yugoslavian airliner that collided with a
British jetliner in 1976 survived a 38,000-foot fall, Eckert said.
   German plots during World War II who crashed and died at the
controls of their planes suffered injuries similar to those
inflicted on the flight's pilot, he said.
   ``There was a mark on the thumb of the right hand of the pilot
that suggests the pilot was holding the yoke of the plane on impact
and was alive and holding on for dear life,'' Eckert said.
   Eckert's comments came in a Friday interview, the memo he wrote
to Orr and an article he wrote for the American Journal of Forensic
Medicine and Pathology, the professional journal of the National
Association of Medical Examiners. The report was published in the
quarterly's fall issue.
   Eckert toured the crash site and investigation centers about
five months after the crash. He wrote the confidential memo to Orr
shortly after the visit and gave a copy Friday to The Associated
Press.
   Eckert viewed the five main areas where bodies and debris fell,
saw some bodies and talked to pathologists.
   Autopsy records and remains could help determine who survived
the blast, he said.

<TEXT>
   Red Army soldiers stationed in what was
East Germany before last week are pilfering their arsenals and
selling everything from assault rifles to small rockets, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   German officials are worried the weapons might end up in the
hands of terrorists, Welt am Sonntag reported.
   Federal officials report that Soviet soldiers are selling AK-47
assault rifles, ground-to-air rockets, mines, hand-held weapons and
anti-tank weapons. The AK-47s are said to be selling for the
equivalent of $227, the newspaper reported.
   Bernd Wilz, a lawmaker with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing
coalition, urged that a group be set up to investigate the sales.
   ``The Soviet Union cannot have an interest in seeing its weapons
flooding the black market in Germany,'' Wilz was quoted as saying.
   The 370,000 soldiers based in what was East Germany are to be
returned home over the next four years under a Soviet-German
agreement.
   Many of the soldiers, who have lived relatively well in East
Germany, are said to be worried they will not have jobs or housing
when they return home.

   Elections for the body that picks Iran's
spirital leader are threatening to aggravate a simmering feud
between President Hashemi Rafsanjani's government and his radical
rivals.
   The hard-liners accuse the current spiritual leader, Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, of backing Rafsanjani and rigging the elections to
exclude radical candidates from the 83-member Assembly of Experts.
They say Monday's popular vote must be postponed.
   The anti-Western radicals have been on the defensive since the
death of their revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, in June 1989.
   They fear a purge by Rafsanjani, who has tried to mend bridges
with the West after more than a decade of hostility. They suffered
a further blow last week when Tehran resumed relations with Britain
after an 18-month break.
   Radical leaders believe such ties will dilute Khomeini's zealous
1979 revolution, which overthrew the pro-Western Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi and replaced him with the Islamic Republic.
   The tug-of-war between the two factions, though officially
denied, has never been far from the public eye. But it also has
never been as public as it has recently.
   Fistfights erupted in the radical-dominated Parliament, or
Majlis, during a debate on the issue last week, sources in Tehran
said on condition of anonymity.
   The government radio, broadcasting the heated debate live,
abruptly went off the air when the fighting started, the sources
said.
   The radicals reportedly threatened to stage protest rallies in
Tehran on Monday. Diplomatic sources in Tehran said Saturday the
situation was ``tense.''
   Jolted by a warning from Khamenei against allowing the feud to
boil over, Tehran radio said ``hundreds'' of radical organizations
and personalities had pledged their support for the government.
   The Revolutionary Guards, Iran's main fighting force which is
believed dominated by radical sympathizers, warned hard-liners not
to widen the divisions inside the Tehran hierarchy.
   But the Mujahedeen Khalq, an opposition group based in Iraq,
said in a statement Saturday that many of the Revolutionary Guards,
who maintain law and order, are themselves against the elections
because their ideological allies have been dumped.
   The radicals, angered by Khamenei's support for Rafsanjani in
his campaign to ease the government's hold on the economy and move
closer to the West, have aimed their criticism at him.
   Led by former interior minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, the
hard-liners have accused Khamenei of lacking the qualifications for
leadership.
   Khamenei, 51, a middle-ranking cleric, was overwelmingly chosen
by the Assembly of Experts to replace Khomeini. Overnight, he was
promoted to Ayatollah, the highest clerical rank in the Shiite
Moslem hierarchy.
   But sources in Tehran said on condition of anonymity that the
hard-liners were seeking to win enough seats in the Assembly of
Experts to depose Khamenei and replace him with a
radical-controlled leadership council.
   To pre-empt that, Khamenei several weeks ago ordered his allies
on the Council of Guardians to pass a new law requiring candidates
to sit for an examination before they can run for the assembly. The
Council screens parliamentary legislation to ensure it conforms
with Islamic principles.
   Out of 169 candidates who took the exam, 60 failed. Sources said
most were radicals, including Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karrubi.
   Some radicals refused to sit for the examinations. Three
hard-liners who did pass later withdrew their names in protest.
   In a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, Rafsanjani denied any move to
sideline his radical opposition, Tehran radio reported.
   ``There is no such thought either in the mind of the leader, or
the Guardian council, nor do others think like this,'' he said.
   The Mujahedeen statement said that in Wednesday's Parliament
session, Sadegh Khalkhali, a vehement radical, attacked the
Guardian Council and said, ``If it has been decided that we are to
be cast aside, tell us officially.''
   He warned: ``We will stand by our words until the very last drop
of our blood.''

<HEAD>EC Monetary Officials Approve Britain's Decision on Pound</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   European finance chiefs on Saturday
approved Britain's long-awaited decision to enter the pound into
their exchange rate linkage, giving a fresh push to efforts to
unite their nations' economies.
   The finance officials said Britain's surprise move marked ``a
significant advance'' in forging closer economic and monetary links
among the 12 nations of the European Community trading bloc.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sharply reversed
long-standing economic policy to let the pound join the system,
which is heavily influenced by the strong German mark.
   She so far has resisted radical plans that would quickly lead to
a common currency and a central bank for the community nations.
   The economic project would give an added dimension to the
trading bloc's campaign to tear down by the end of 1992 the many
trade barriers preventing the free flow of people, money, goods and
services among the nations. It will create a vast consumer market
of more than 330 million people.
   The move to add the pound to the exchange rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System was unlikely have an impact on the U.S.
dollar, which is not part of the arrangement.
   The exchange rate mechanism seeks to prevent wide shifts in
exchange rates of the member nations and keep inflation and
interest rates under control.
   Central banks are required to prevent their currencies from
falling outside certain ranges by intervening - buying and selling
currencies - in the exchange markets.
   In a statement, the finance chiefs announced acceptance of
Britain's proposal to tie the pound to the mechanism on Monday with
a central rate of 2.95 German marks. It will be allowed to swing 6
percent above or below that figure for an unspecified
``transitional period,'' said the statement.
   The Spanish peseta, the last currency to join the system in June
1989, also swings in a 6 percent range. All the other currencies
move in a narrower band of 2.25 percent. Last January, the Italian
government narrowed the range for the lira from 6 percent to 2.25
percent.
   With the pound's addition, the currencies of 10 community
nations - Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland,
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain - will be linked in
the exchange rate mechanism. Only the currencies of Portugal and
Greece remain outside the link.
   Carlos Tavares, secretary of state at the Portuguese Treasury,
predicted his country's escudo would be the next to join, sometime
before 1993.
   In their statement, the finance ministers and central bank
governors said they considered the British move ``a strengthened
commitment by the British authorities to pursue a firm
anti-inflationary policy.''
   Mrs. Thatcher had said she would not allow the pound to join the
linkage until Britain's inflation rate dropped closer to the
European average of about 5 percent.
   After Friday's announcement, she said she made her decision
because the country's double-digit inflation rate was on the verge
of falling. Being part of the arrangement, she said, ``would
underpin our anti-inflationary stance.''
   The currency linkage is the first stage of a three-part plan for
creating an economic and monetary union. In later stages a single
currency and a European-wide central bank would be created, modeled
after the U.S. Federal Reserve.
   Britain recently has gained support for its go-slow approach to
monetary union because of worries about the economic impact of the
Persian Gulf crisis. The surge in oil prices and inflation could
make it harder to merge the different economies.
   Even so, the community will open a special conference in
mid-December to make changes in its founding treaty so new economic
agencies can be set up.

   There aren't many happy
campers in Yosemite National Park this weekend.
   On a beautiful, Indian summer afternoon Saturday, with the
leaves turning color and the meadows filled with vacationers, the
news that all campsites would be shut down triggered anger and
disappointment.
   Some blamed Congress, some President Bush. But none of the 7,000
campers liked it when National Park Service officials told them
they had to clear out by 1 p.m. Sunday because of the budget crisis
in Washington.
   Bush has ordered non-essential federal government agencies
across the nation closed in the absence of a budget agreement.
   ``I think it's horrible,'' said Becky Vaccarezza of Stockton,
who months ago made reservations for a weeklong vacation with five
other adults and six children.
   ``When you're at home you deal with the bills and everything.
But when you come up here, this is everybody's escape. This is how
you're supposed to get away from budgets,'' she said. ``It's a
major disappointment. We had so many plans for the kids.''
   This was to be the last big weekend of the year at Yosemite -
the final days of its centennial celebration - before rangers start
preparing the campgrounds for winter. Instead of relaxing and
enjoying the magnificent views of Half Dome and El Capitan, many
visitors worried about packing up Sunday morning and finding
somewhere to stay.
   The Ahwahnee Hotel, Yosemite Lodge and other facilities operated
by the Curry Co. will remain open, as will the visitors center with
a reduced staff.
   But the park service canceled nature walks Saturday, sent
interpretive rangers home and closed the centennial exhibit and
Indian cultural museum in this park east of San Francisco near the
Nevada state line.
   Yosemite superintendent Michael Finley said Interior Department
officials in Washington told him to curtail all operations except
emergency services.
   ``There's no authority for me to spend money,'' Finley said.
``The irony of it is that the shutdown is very expensive.''
   Seasonal workers let go would have helped the National Park
Service rangers prepare Yosemite for winter, he said, adding that
it would cost more money in the long run to have rangers do that
work alone.
   Yosemite evacuated 15,000 visitors this summer because of fires,
but this was the first time people have been told to go home
because the U.S. government had run out of money.
   ``This is a real letdown,'' said Tom Figlio, on vacation from
his home in New Jersey. ``I always wanted to see Yosemite. It's
very discouraging.''

   The United Nations, fearing the Persian Gulf crisis might last
through the winter, announced Saturday it will stockpile food for
another 120,000 refugees from Iraq and Kuwait and buy winter tents
for those stranded in camps.
   Saudi Arabia recalled its ambassador to Jordan, diplomatic
sources said, in another reflection of souring relations between
the Arab neighbors since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Saudi Arabia, which requested a U.S.-led multinational force to
help defend it after the Iraqi invasion, expelled Jordanian
diplomats and cut oil and aid to Jordan last month because Amman
had not strongly protested Iraq's actions.
   U.S. officials, meanwhile, said the 2-month-old U.S. troop
buildup in Saudi Arabia is virtually complete. But the officials in
Washington and Saudi Arabia said the U.S. forces still lack the
firepower and supplies necessary to launch a successful ground
offensive against Iraqi troops in Kuwait.
   Britain's armed forces minister, Archibald Hamilton, said in
Dharhran, Saudi Arabia, he expected Britain's 7th Armored Brigade,
with about 7,000 troops and 120 Challenger tanks, to be in place in
the Saudi desert by early November, alongside U.S. Marine uits
already there. The unit won fame as the Desert Rats during World
War II North African campaigns.
   Also Saturday, Italy's remaining two diplomats abandoned its
diplomatic mission in Kuwait and half of Britain's delegation left
the emirate after Iraq cut supplies and power to the compounds.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein reportedly assured a top Soviet
diplomat that Soviets in Iraq may leave the country soon.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported the assurance,
which it said was made by Saddam to Kremlin envoy Yevgeny Primakov.
Primakov left Baghdad Saturday after talking with Saddam and
delivering a message from President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   About 5,000 Soviets have been prevented from leaving Iraq since
the invasion, although they are not among the Westerners being held
as ``guests'' at hotels and strategic sites in an Iraqi effort to
deter Western attack.
   Hundreds of thousands of foreigners have fled Iraq and Kuwait
since the invasion, and U.N. and Jordanian officials fear 80,000
more refugees may arrive in Jordan this week.
   In Amman, U.N. Undersecretary-General Mohammad Essaafi said the
U.N.'s disaster relief agency and Jordanian authorities are
preparing food stockpiles to feed 120,000 more people. Essaafi said
the agency also is buying 7,600 winter tents to replace the summer
tents now set up in refugee camps around the country.
   ``If there's a worsening of the situation in Iraq and Kuwait, we
might expect an increased flow of evacuees, particularly Egyptian
nationals, who might cross in very large numbers,'' he added.
   Some 422,400 refugees, mainly Egyptian and Asians, have been
flown out of Jordan in more than 1,798 flights by military and
civilian aircraft since Aug. 5, Jordanian civil aviation officials
said.
   Another 60,000 have been flown home from Turkey and hundreds of
thousands, mainly Egyptians, have been taken home by sea.
   In other developments:
   -Iraqi radio, monitored in Britain, said Iran and Iraq would
hold talks this week on reopening embassies in Tehran and Baghdad.
An Iraqi delegation will arrive in Iran Tuesday. The two nations
fought a war from 1980-88. Baghdad now seeks to persuade Iran to
help it skirt U.N. economic sanctions on Iraq.
   -Jordan announced an energy rationing program, effective next
Saturday, due to Saudi Arabia's recent cutoff of oil supplies.
   -Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat
arrived in Amman from Baghdad on Saturday, proposing a
U.N.-sponsored solution to the crisis and other regional conflicts.
   -British warships stopped and searched two Indian ships carrying
more than 2,000 Indians from Iraq, then cleared their travel to the
United Arab Emirates. The refugee ships were to arrive Sunday.
   -Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu met with Saudi King Fahd
and affirmed Japanese support for Saudi Arabia in the gulf crisis.
   -Kuwait's crown prince, Sheik Saad, said the emirate's exiled
rulers have invited 450 prominent Kuwaitis to Saudi Arabia discuss
a new type of government if and when Iraq pulls out of Kuwait.
   -An Egyptian state newspaper said authorities have arrested 30
Arabs - 23 Palestinians and seven Iraqis - sent by Iraq to attack
city squares, tourist attractions and other targets to create
disorder.
   -The British Foreign Office said a 46-year-old Scottish man has
died in Kuwait after suffering an undisclosed illness. William
Norrie Atack, a scientist, had worked in Kuwait for eight years as
a scientific officer at the Ministry of Public Health, his family
said.

<HEAD>Pakistani Clerics Say Heaven Closed to Bhutto Supporters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From the pulpits of Islamic mosques,
clerics are warning that the gates of heaven will be closed to
those who vote for ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's party in
Oct. 24 parliamentary elections.
   Abdul Qadir told hundreds of faithful attending prayers on
Friday, the Moslem sabbath, that unless they abandoned Ms. Bhutto's
party their spiritual fate would be sealed.
   ``Anyone who supports the Pakistan People's Party will not enter
heaven,'' he said at Badshahi Mosque in Lahore.
   Pakistan's powerful religious right has criticized Ms. Bhutto
since she became the first woman to rule a modern Moslem nation in
1988. She has been accused of being an infidel or non-believer,
slammed for her Western education and ridiculed for cultivating an
Islamic image by always wearing voluminous shawls and a headscarve.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan used his constitutional authority to
dismiss the 37-year-old Ms. Bhutto on Aug. 6, 20 months after she
took office.
   She, her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, and several former Cabinet
ministers have been charged before special one-judge tribunals with
corruption and abuse of power.
   Ms. Bhutto's supporters say they are victims of political
persecution. Ms. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was driven
out of power in 1977 and tried before similar courts. Bhutto was
executed in 1979.
   Because of the strong emotions on both sides, many fear the Oct.
24 election could be the most violent in the country's 43-year
history.
   In the latest accusation against an official of Ms. Bhutto's
government, former railways minister Farooq Ahmed Leghari has been
charged with murder, according to news reports Saturday.
   A one-paragraph news item distributed by the state-run news
agency said he was charged in connection with the death of a
relative in the village of Dera Ismail Khan, 180 miles south of
Islamabad.
   It gave few details and Leghari could not be immediately reached
for comment.

   President Bush successfully vetoed legislation
Saturday to restore the government's ability to spend money and
presided over the gradual shutdown of non-essential services in a
confrontation spawned by deadlock over the federal deficit.
   Negotiators from the White House and Congress resumed
negotiations on a package of spending cuts and tax increases that
could win approval and end the impasse - but not before Sunday
night at the earliest.
   But in the meantime, the president said he would no longer abide
``business as usual'' by the Democratic-controlled Congress. He
vetoed a bill that would have permitted the government to operate
normally for another week, and a few hours later, the House failed
to override the veto.
   The 260-138 vote override was six short of the two-thirds
majority required. On the vote, 235 Democrats and 25 Republicans
voted to overturn Bush's veto and nine Democrats and 129
Republicans voted to uphold it.
   ``Responsible congressional action to reduce the deficit can be
delayed no longer,'' Bush said in his veto message.
   Democrats denounced the president's decision. ``Unnecessary,
unjustified and harmful,'' said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash.
   But under the eyes of tourists packing the visitors' galleries
because many federal tourist attractions in town were closed, the
House mustered only the 260 votes to override, well short of the
two-thirds vote needed.
   Reflecting the importance of the budget fight and lawmakers'
recent spate of long hours, the debate was unusually acrimonious.
   ``Mr. Speaker, there are snakes loose in the chamber,'' shouted
Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., after Democrats hissed during the
reading of Bush's veto message.
   But Republicans were hissing moments later after Rep. Richard
Durbin, D-Ill., said Bush's veto resulted in ``treating 2 million
federal workers like Saddam Hussein treats his so-called guests in
Iraq.''
   Feelings ran so high that angry conservative Republicans blocked
an effort by leaders of both parties to recess the House for two
hours so lawmakers could have dinner while budget negotiators tried
to work out a compromise.
   At the White House, spokesman Roman Popadiuk said: ``We are
pleased that the House has sustained the veto. It is now time for
the House to get on with dealing with the budget.''
   Both the House and Senate adjourned for the evening after the
House vote, which made any Senate override action moot, but
scheduled Sunday afternoon sessions to be available to consider any
new budget proposals. Bush, meanwhile, motored to Camp David for
the night.
   The federal shutdown presumably would increase pressure on the
negotiators trying to piece together a plan to replace the
five-year, $500 billion package of tax increases and spending cuts
that was defeated in the House after midnight Thursday night.
   House GOP Leader Bob Michel of Illinois said he hoped Congress
and the White House could break the gridlock before the end of the
three-day Columbus Day weekend, when millions of federal workers
face the threat of furloughs.
   There was no immediate word from congressional leaders on their
next move. One possible step was to pass legislation replenishing
the government's coffers, but coupled with across-the-board
spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman anti-deficit law. Bush
hinted he might accept such a measure, which would give negotiators
time to craft a larger deficit-reduction package.
   The earlier deficit-reduction plan went down in a crescendo of
criticism - with Republicans expressing anger over tax hikes and
Democrats rebelling over $60 billion in cuts in the Medicare
program that pays for health care for the elderly.
   Bush and the Democratic leaders of Congress had jointly forged
that agreement - and the president said he still supported it.
   But at the same time, his decision to veto the short-term
funding bill and proceed with the shutdown of non-essential
government services meant a high-stakes political showdown was
unfolding with the Democratic majorities of Congress.
   Asked how long he was willing to keep government doors locked,
he replied:
   ``It's not a question of how long I can take it,'' Bush said.
``It's a question of how long Congress can take it. Congress is
where the action is.''
   The White House last week estimated the fiscal 1991 budget
deficit would be about $294 billion. The budget agreement the House
rejected would have cut the deficit $40 billion this year and $500
billion over five years.
   Bush said he was ``very sorry'' if anyone was inconvenienced by
the shutdown, which was felt first at the Washington Monument,
Lincoln Memorial, Smithsonian museums and popular sites in the
nation's capital.
   In fact, the early disruptions were minimal, confined largely to
government tourist attractions.
   The full impact of the shutdown of non-essential services was
not likely to be felt until after Monday's Columbus Day holiday for
federal workers. And the administration said it had the authority
to maintain essential services such as the military, air traffic
safety control and prison control.
   Despite his criticism aimed at Congress, Bush seemed to offer
the possibility for a fresh compromise on taxes.
   He refused to dismiss reporters' questions that in return for
cuts in the capital gains tax - a 1988 Bush campaign promise - he
might accept Democrats' demands for higher income taxes on the
wealthy.
   ``I remain in a flexible frame of mind,'' the president said.
   Neither item was included in the deficit-reduction package that
Bush agreed to last weekend with congressional leaders.
   The capital gains tax - levied on profits from sales of real
estate and other property - is now the same as for other income,
with a top 33 percent rate. Bush has proposed slashing that rate to
15 percent, arguing it would spur sales and feed cash into the
economy.
   But Democrats, arguing that most of the tax break would be
enjoyed by the wealthy, have insisted that income tax rates on the
rich be raised as a tradeoff.
   Dropping the two tax changes was the last major hurdle the two
sides cleared in their four contentious months of negotiations.
   That plan was soundly rejected by a rebellious House early
Friday as majorities of rank-and-file Republicans and Democrats
turned on their own party leaders.
   The stunning 254-179 defeat came despite the most intense
lobbying campaign of Bush's presidency, and equally all-out efforts
by top lawmakers of both parties.
   Some GOP representatives still had bitter tastes in their mouths
from the White House arm-twisting, accusing Chief of Staff John
Sununu and budget director Richard Darman of particularly gruff
behavior.
   ``Your staff did a lot of insensitive and unnecessary things to
Republican members,'' Rep. Jim Lightfoot, R-Iowa, wrote Saturday in
a letter to Bush. ``Bring Millie, but leave the pit dogs at the
White House.''
   Many lawmakers were alienated by the package's costs to poor and
middle-income people, including Medicare cuts and tax hikes on
home-heating oil and gasoline.

   Iraq has strengthened its forces in southern Iraq and Kuwait and

Saddam toured the streets of Kuwait, which ``appeared flourishing
after its return to the mother homeland.'' Kuwait City `` glittered
with pride'' at Saddam's visit, said the news agency, monitored in
Nicosia.

   Iraq has high-explosive devices that pack the equivalent
destructive power of small nuclear bombs, and military officials
say the United States has no ready defense against them, the Los
Angeles Times reports. The fuel-air explosives create a huge
fireball and shock wave over a concentrated area, but without the
radiation fallout associated with nuclear weapons, the newspaper
says. The explosives have 10 times the power of conventional
explosives and could devastate oil fields, air bases and troops,
the Times reported.

   U.S. military officials said the buildup on the Arabian
peninsula is virtually complete, but American forces still lack the
firepower and supplies necessary to launch a successful ground
offensive against Iraqi troops in Kuwait. Diplomatic sources said
Saudi Arabia recalled its ambassador to Jordan, in another
reflection of souring relations between the Arab neighbors.

<HEAD>Participants Share Goal At `Catalyst' Environmental Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 7,000 people - more than twice the
number organizers expected - turned out for a three-day conference
on improving the environment.
   Jeremy Hays, co-chairman of the Catalyst environmental
conference at the University of Illinois, was delighted and
surprised at the response. He welcomed the crowd Friday night with
a question: ``Where in the heck did you all come from?''
   Most of the participants were college students. They hailed from
big cities and small towns in all 50 states and shared a common
goal: improving the environment.
   Organizers said they hoped the conference would help train a new
generation of environmental leaders.
   Adam Spak and his friends came from Kansas City, Mo., with their
brightly painted Recycling Bus, a converted school bus used to pick
up trash after a curbside recycling bill failed in Kansas City.
   Spak said he hoped to share details of the program with other
activists and to learn from others at the conference how to
persuade Kansas City officials to support recycling.
   Among the speakers Friday night was actor Robert Redford, who
said ``we've messed up the air, the land, the water in our passion
to control things.
   ``I'm not a prophet of gloom and doom,'' Redford said. ``But,
I've always assumed a love of land and a love of country go
together.''
   Jim McGuire, a student at the University of Minnesota, said he
hoped the conference would bring student activists credibility. The
gathering was organized by the Student Environmental Action
Coalition.
   ``There's always statements that students aren't active on
issues from the mainstream press,'' said McGuire. ``It's been my
sense for quite a while that that's not true. I think this shows
that.
   ``But, what's really going to show it in the long run is action
that comes out of this.''

<HEAD>Von Weizsacker: Germany'll Always Remember Holocaust
Responsibility</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Germany's President Richard von Weizsacker, in
a special message to the Israeli people, said Saturday that his
country will always remember its responsibility for the Holocaust
and the six million Jewish victims.
   ``Something terrible has been done in the name of the Germans -
the gravest and the most terrible crime ever committed, the
Holocaust. Its memory lives with us as part of our hope for the
future. And I hope that our obligations towards the past and our
aspirations towards peace in the future will be understood in
Israel too,'' von Weizsacker said.
   His remarks were carried in an Israel Television broadcast. He
said responsibility for the Holocaust would be shared by all in the
new Germany.
   ``As we unite as Germans, something that has been divided is
also reuniting, namely: the bearing of responsibility for the
results of our history,'' von Weizsacker said. ``I am convinced
that the young generation in East Germany, which has now united
with us in the West, is aware of the responsibility for the results
of history.''
   The television said von Weizsacker made the statement in
response to a written appeal from Israel's President Chaim Herzog.
   Israel, founded in 1948 as a Jewish homeland largely in response
to Holocaust, accepted Germany's unification with a heavy heart.
   ``There have been two parts of Germany. One, a democratic state
that has accepted the historic responsibility and historic guilt,
and has been close to Israel in many fields, and East Germany,
which has been hostile towards Israel,'' said Herzog, who also
spoke on the television.
   ``Looking back at the 40 years of experience with West
Germany... I hope and I'm almost certain that the statements of
President von Weizsacker, and Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl, and all the
leadership will guide the united Germany in its relations with
Israel,'' Herzog said.

   -A busload of tourists from Indiana drove six hours to reach the
Great Smoky Mountain National Park, nnly to be turned away by
rangers Saturday at Clingman's Dome, the highest point in the park.
   ``It's really unfair to rub this in the people's face. This is
really not helping relations with the public. I would suspect if
they wanted to get in the good graces of the people, they would
work for free for one day,'' said Bob Davenport, director for the
weekend tour arranged by Wandering Wheels tour company from Upland,
Ind. At the park visitors center, Eddie Christensen of Napa,
Calif., a retired Corps of Engineers employee said: ``I definitely
feel like George Bush is doing this to make Congress see his way. I
don't see why they should make the people suffer for it. It's
politics, no question about it.''
   -In Montana, `closed'' signs went up on the gates at the Custer
Battlefield National Monument and the National Bison Range, but few
other effects of the national budget impasse were immediately
visible. Visitors could still enter both places, as well as Glacier
and Yellowstone national parks, but few or no services were
available.
   -At Yosemite National Park in California, some 7,000 campers
were told they would have to clear out by 1 p.m. Sunday because of
the budget crisis. ``I think it's horrible,'' said Becky Vaccarezza
of Stockton, who months ago had made reservations for a week-long
vacation with five other adults and six children. ``When you're at
home you deal with the bills and everything. But when you come up
here, this is everybody's escape. This is how you're supposed to
get away from budgets. It's a major disappointment. We had so many
plans for the kids.'' Yosemite superintendent Michael Finley said
he was told by Interior Department officials in Washington not to
close the park, but to curtail all operations except emergency
services.
   -Elsewhere in California, the budget crisis also caused a
shutdown of other popular venues in California, including Alcatraz,
Muir Woods and Stinson Beach in the Golden Gate National Recreation
Area in Northern California, and the Joshua Tree and Death Valley
national monuments in Southern California. Odette Zwetzig, acting
superintendent of Death Valley National Monument, said, ``I've been
with the park service for over 15 years. I have seen shutdowns ...
(but) I have not seen quite the hullabaloo that is going on with
this one. ... I've been around long enough to know that eventually
they'll pass a budget. In the meantime ... the (tourists) are very
sad. They've come so far and they've made their plans for a
vacation and there are no services we can offer.''
   -In Michigan, the budget stalemate was having an impact in the
deepest woods, where park rangers and naturalists were among
victims. Layoffs were reported at the Pictured Rocks National
Lakeshore at Munising and at the Sleeping Bear Dunes on Lake
Michigan near Empire. That left some tourists on their own Saturday
in finding the best places to see the fall color display, which is
at its peak in the area. At the Picture Rocks on Lake Superior, the
visitor center was open Saturday, but scheduled to close Sunday and
Monday said Julie Fosbender, an information assistant for the
Munising Ranger District. ``If they want information on the park or
a back country camping permit, there won't be anyone around,'' she
said. ``Then again, there won't be anyone out there anyway to check
and see if they have a permit.''
   -In Texas, visitors were turned away from seashores and mountain
lodges. At Big Bend National Park in West Texas, spokesman Roy
Given had to notify guests on Saturday they were no longer welcome
at the remote wilderness park. The park hotel, restaurant and
stables will remain open, but Big Bend no longer is offering its
guided tours, campground facilities or its back country and river
permits.
   -In Pennsylvania, historic buildings were closed, hikes canceled
and guides absent at National Park Service sites across the state.
``We stopped here especially to see the treasures of Philadelphia,
and they're closed to us,'' said Dee Gilmore, 67, of Riverside,
Calif., who was visiting Independence National Historical Park. ``I
think this is a sad way for President Bush to try to get his own
way.'' Andrea Vogel, 10, of Washington, D.C., who was traveling
with her parents and brother, said, ``We came to see the history of
Philadelphia and I don't think it's fair that they should close
down the tourist sites. Why would people want to come to
Philadelphia anymore?''
   -In Washington state, Olympic National Park was shutting down
and Mount Rainier National Park was closing all but one small
campground.
   -In Arkansas, five national parks were closed.
   -In northern Minnesota's Voyageur's National Park, only
essential workers were overseeing the park's operation, said Raoul
Lufbery, facility manager. One ranger was patrolling the northern
district of the park and one in the southern district, Lufbery
said. Usually, there are four to five rangers patrolling the park
on weekends, he said. The park will remain open, with its trails,
campsites and boat launches still available, he said.
   -In Florida, ticket takers at Everglades National Park were sent
home, allowing motorists to drive in free. Inside, most of the
privately-run concessions remained open. At the opposite end of the
state, Jerry Eubanks, supervisor of the Gulf Islands National
Seashore headquartered in Gulf Breeze, said the park that includes
barrier islands and mainland recreation areas in the Florida
Panhandle and Mississippi will remain open. ``We have looked at
alternatives,'' he said. ``We've just refreshed in our own minds
what are essential health and safety measures, but we have no plans
as of now for shutting down.''
   -In Connecticut, the shutdown and wrangling in Washington had
little effect on services, but forced the state's congressional
leaders to cancel their campaign stops in the state Saturday. For
incumbents trying to get in some campaigning in the final stretch
before the election in November, losing a chance to campaign at
town fairs and parades throughout the state was frustrating. ``I
just can't tell you what it's like to know your opponent is out
there campaigning and you can't do anything,'' said Republican Rep.
Christopher Shays, who faces a challenge from attorney Alfred J.
Smith, a Democrat from Darien.
   -In Iowa, hundreds of visitors were touring the Herbert Hoover
Presidential Library and Museum, most buildings on the 186-acre
grounds were locked up and National Park Service rangers were off
duty, said a clerk at the museum. The library and museum are
operated by the National Archives and Records Administration, while
the grounds - which include Hoover's grave site, his birthplace
cottage and a blacksmith shop - are under the jurisdiction of the
National Park Service. ``As to why we're open today and the
National Park Service is not, I don't know,'' said Chris
Christensen, a sales clerk in the library and museum.
   -In Nebraska, many federal employees nervously enjoyed their
three-day weekend. ``I probably should be worried, but I'm not,''
said Doug Druliner, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey.
``We've gone through this thing in the past, but there was not as
much hype about it. We've had furloughs in the past and been paid
later.'' Jim Kula, a service representative with the Social
Security Department, agreed. ``But this is the first time they were
required to give us a formal 30-day warning that there might be
furloughs,'' he added.
   -In Wyoming, Yellowstone National Park officials began a phased
closure of the park. Spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo said that while the
park was open on Saturday and would remain open through the long
Columbus Day weekend, it was staffed only by emergency and utility
personnel. The Old Faithful Inn and four campgrounds were expected
to remain open through the weekend, Anzelmo said. ``There is a
snowstorm here and we don't want to strand visitors,'' she said.
``Later in the weekend, we may have to start further closures. We
hope we don't have to close down ... completely. ... Because
Yellowstone is so large and has a large visitor population, we just
can't simply shut a gate and walk away.''

<HEAD>Parliament Considers Adoption of Multiparty System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The People's Assembly opened debate on
a new constitution that envisions a multiparty democracy with full
freedom of expression, the national news agency reported Saturday.
   In the document, the ruling FRELIMO party is no longer referred
to as the nation's leading force,AIM reported. FRELIMO led the
guerrilla war to drive the Portuguese from Mozambique and has been
the sole legal party in the southeast African nation since the war
ended in 1975.
   Virtually all members of the People's Assembly, or parliament,
belong to FRELIMO and were expected to back the changes, proposed
by President Joachim Chissano. Debate began Friday.
   On July 31, Chissano announced that Mozambique should have a
multiparty system in place for parliamentary and presidential
elections scheduled for next year. He previously had opposed
multiparty democracy, saying it would encourage tribalism and waste
the country's scarce resources.
   Chissano also has promised to end a 13-year-old civil war with
the Mozambique National Resistance that has claimed 600,000 lives
and left about half the country's 15 million people in need of
donated food.
   The government and the rebels have held a series of peace talks
this year. A multiparty system and new election laws are two key
demands of the rebels.
   The FRELIMO party was Marxist, but has undergone reforms in
recent years and officially dropped its Marxist label last year.
   The draft includes provisions allowing freedom of expression,
freedom of the press and the right to strike. AIM reported the
draft would give the president power to dissolve parliament if it
rejected the government program.
   The Central Committee approved resolutions in August that
suggested any new electoral laws should prohibit parties set up
along racial, ethnic, regional or religious lines.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Organizers of a Columbus Day parade Saturday
allowed American Indian Movement leader Russell Means and about 150
supporters to lead the procession to avoid a threatened
demonstration.
   Means, whose backers carried signs denouncing Christopher
Columbus as a murderer, called the concession by the city's
Federation of Italian-American Organizations ``a historic first.''
   ``One of the most beautiful things ... is that they understand
that we have a political agenda,'' Means said. ``Because of their
belief in the First Amendment, we're more than welcome to lead the
parade.''
   Means' supporters, who included non-Indians, marched a block
ahead of the main parade participants, beating a drum and chanting
Indian ceremonial songs. At the reviewing stand, the group waved to
the parade organizers, who waved back.
   Afterward, the group passed around a eremonial pipe at the
state Capitol and made plans to rally at the Christopher Columbus
statue in Civic Center Park on Monday.
   Means initially had been denied permission to march in the
parade, because he has called Columbus a genocidal killer on a par
with Adolf Hitler. Last year, Means was arrested for pouring fake
blood over the Columbus statue.
   But less than an hour before the parade began Saturday, Bill
Marinella, chairman of the parade committee, said the Indian
activists and their supporters would lead the parade. He said
organizers gave in because they feared a disruption of the parade
could endanger spectators.
   Denver's first Columbus Day parade since 1981 was organized in
anticipation of the 500th anniversary of Columbus' first voyage to
America.
   The 1992 anniversary is a cause for celebration of
Italian-American pride in Columbus, who was born in Genoa, Italy,
in 1451 but sailed under the Spanish flag. The American Indian
Movement sees the anniversary as a chance to educate Americans
about Columbus' involvement in slave trading and the deaths of
natives of the lands he discovered.
   The parade's grand marshal was character actor Vito Scotti, who
is featured locally on Cub Foods commercials.

   Three Arabs suspected of helping Israeli
authorities or dealing drugs were killed in the occupied lands by
fellow Palestinians, according to reports Saturday.
   Israel radio said the body of 27-year-old Samih Khalil Hamad of
Beit Hanoun village in the occupied Gaza Strip was found in an
orange grove Saturday. He had been stabbed and beaten to death,
Arab reporters said. They said Palestinian activists suspected
Hamad of collaboration.
   On Friday, Mustafa Hasan Abu Okel, 30, was found stabbed to
death at his house in Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp, Arab reports
said. Abu Okel was reportedly known as a drug dealer.
   Before dawn Saturday in Beit Umar, in the occupied West Bank,
masked Palestinian enforcers entered the home of Taghrib Abu Ayash,
36, and shot her to death. Arab reports said Mrs. Abu Ayash, a
mother of seven, also was suspected of collaboration.
   The military command confirmed the three deaths, but said Abu
Okel's death was apparently a criminal killing.
   Most of the 280 Palestinians slain by other Arabs in the
34-month uprising against the Israeli occupation were accused of
serving as informants for the military authorities. But they
include drug dealers and prostitutes, who uprising activists see as
corrupting Palestinian morals and as easy prey for Israel's secret
services.
   Israeli soldiers or civilians have killed at least 736
Palestinians during the revolt, which has left 48 Israelis dead.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sanduri said about 500 people at a protest
rally in the village of Isiwiya were dispersed by tear gas. The
Palestine Press Services said two youths were wounded by rubber
bullets.

   A county prosecutor involved in a murder
investigation that apparently led to a witness' death has killed
himself, police said.
   Collier Vale, 39, was found dead in his apartment Friday from a
self-inflicted gunshot wound, a police report said.
   Sgt. Fred Ragghianti said the case remained under investigation.
A preliminary coroner's report indicated no sign of foul play and
an autopsy was to be performed.
   Vale, a Monterey County prosecutor for 10 years who was recently
promoted to assistant district attorney, was the focus of
nationwide media attention stemming from a mix-up that exposed a
murder witness to retaliation.
   Sonjii Johnson, 23, of Seaside, was shot to death in the
driveway of her parents' home in August 1989. Bradley Hardison, 25,
is accused of slaying Ms. Johnson so she could not testify against
him in another case.
   Vale and a police officer had earlier mistakenly telephoned a
woman named Sonya Johnson, who spread the word that Sonjii Johnson
must be helping police.
   The district attorney's office has maintained that the case was
not mishandled. The nationally syndicated television program ``A
Current Affair'' recently broadcast a segment on the phone call and
Ms. Johnson's subsequent death.
   Vale ``was affected deeply by having his name connected'' with
the case, said Superior Court Judge John Phillips.
   ``I guess we didn't know how strongly he was affected,'' he
said.
   Vale joined the county prosecutor's office in 1979 and
``developed into one of the finest, most dedicated prosecutors any
county could ever have,'' said Phillips, who in his former post as
assistant district attorney hired Vale.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Aide Leaves Iraq after Visit to Saddam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet envoy Yevgeny Primakov, a close
associate and aide of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, left Iraq on Saturday
after delivering a message from the Soviet president to President
Saddam Hussein.
   Primakov, a member of the Soviet Presidential Council, said he
``will remain optimistic that a peaceful and political settlement
for this crisis is always possible,'' according to a Baghdad-based
Soviet journalist who met with Primakov before he left.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported that Saddam had assured
Primakov that Soviets in Iraq may leave the country soon.
   About 5,000 Soviet workers, many of them described as oil
industry technicians, have been prevented from leaving Iraq since
the invasion, although they are not among the Westerners held as
``guests'' at hotels and strategic sites in an effort to deter
attacks.
   Primakov told Saddam that the Kremlin ``favors a political
settlement of the gulf crisis, bearing in mind a return to the
situation that existed before Aug. 2,'' the Soviet news agency Tass
reported.
   He repeated Moscow's belief that Saddam should withdraw
immediately from Kuwait, which Iraq invaded on Aug. 2, Tass said.
   Tass quoted Primakov as saying, ``Settlement of the Kuwaiti
crisis on this basis should give an impetus to the settlement of
other conflicts in the region, above all the Arab-Israeli
conflict.''
   During his stay, Primakov met three times with Yasser Arafat,
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, who was also
visiting Baghdad. Primakov agreed that resolving the Iraq-Kuwait
conflict was possible in connection with other Mideast issues, with
priority being given to the Arab-Israeli question, diplomatic
sources in Baghdad said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Primakov did not reveal the message he brought, but Tass said
``On the instruction of the Soviet president, Primakov raised the
issue of the departure from Iraq of Soviet specialists wishing to
go home.''
   Primakov and Igor Belusov, the Soviet first deputy prime
minister, met with Soviet citizens in Baghdad and at a township
being built with Soviet help near the Euphrates River, Tass said.
   ``The two statesmen explained the steps by the Soviet government
to ensure normal living conditions for Soviet people in the
aggravated situation,'' Tass said.
   Belusov also met with Iraq's oil minister, Issam al-Chalabi, to
discuss the stranded Soviet workers.
   State-run Iraqi News Agency reported the meeting but did not
mention the Soviets who wished to return home.

<HEAD>Wife of `Last POW' Dies in Apparent Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dorothy Marian Shelton, who lobbied for
families of missing servicemen as the wife of the last American
still listed as a prisoner of war in Southeast Asia, has died in an
apparent suicide. She was 57.
   Police said Friday that Mrs. Shelton died Thursday night from an
apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Family members
said she left a note at her home professing her love for her five
children, but it did not mention her husband or offer an
explanation for her death.
   Mrs. Shelton's quest to learn her husband's fate took her to the
jungles of Laos and the halls of Congress in the unwavering belief
that Air Force Col. Charles E. Shelton was still alive.
   A friend said it was a terrible burden.
   ``Marian was carrying a very heavy load on her shoulders with
her husband being the last POW. I think she said, `I just can't
take another day of it.''' said Fran Masterson of Upland, whose
husband was listed as missing in action during the Vietnam War.
   ``You go to sleep at night and your husband's not there. It just
goes on and on and on. You ask yourself, `Is this ever going to
end?' ''
   She is to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery outside
Washington.
   Shelton, then a captain, was shot down over Laos on April 23,
1965, and captured a few days later.
   A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Edward Lundquist, was quoted
this summer as saying the military believed Shelton died in the
1960s from malaria or dysentery.
   But the U.S. government made Shelton a symbol, promoting him,
leaving him on the official rolls as a POW and sending an ``active
duty'' pay check to his wife every month.
   The about 2,500 other men unaccounted for in Southeast Asia have
been listed as presumed dead.
   For 25 years, Mrs. Shelton pressured legislators for help,
traveled the world seeking information about her husband and
appeared on numerous radio and television programs urging the
government to provide more answers to families of the missing.
   Family members said she had been depressed recently but believed
in the POW cause ``to her dying breath.''
   ``She knows one way or another now,'' sister-in-law Faye Newcom
said in a telephone interview from Owensboro, Ky. ``Either he's up
there with her or she knows where he's at. Maybe she can do more
good up there.''
   ``She spent a lot of time looking for answers and couldn't find
them,'' said retired Navy Capt. Red McDaniel, a POW for six years.
``But her death will strengthen the resolve of a lot of people.
This issue will not go away.''

   A hot-air balloon taking part in a
balloon festival drifted into power lines and burst into flames
Saturday, killing both men aboard.
   Pilot Steve Falacy, 46, and passenger William Schobel, 32, both
of Albuquerque, died at University Hospital, said hospital
spokeswoman Annie Olson.
   She declined to release details of the men's injuries.
   Several people who witnessed the accident said the men jumped
from the balloon before it burned.
   The Sandoval County Sheriff's Department, which responded to the
10 a.m. accident, said the pilot apparently was attempting to land
in a nearby field when he drifted into the power lines.
   The accident occurred on the opening day of the 19th annual
Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, about a mile south of
Bernalillo, some seven miles from Balloon Fiesta Park on
Albuquerque's northeast side.
   About 150,000 spectators turned out to watch nearly 600 hot-air
balloons launch under sunny and clear skies.
   Balloon Fiesta president Bob Ruppenthal said a memorial service
for the men would be held Sunday morning and the festival would
proceed as scheduled.
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the National
Transportation Safety Board will investigate the accident,
Ruppenthal said.

   Aeroflot, the Soviet national airline, is
negotiating with Eastern Airlines to buy or lease 13 wide-body jets
in a deal that could be worth more than $150 million to the
troubled U.S. carrier.
   If finalized, it would be Aeroflot's first acquisition of
aircraft manufactured in the West, officials said Friday.
   The Soviets are eyeing Lockheed L-1011 jetliners that
Miami-based Eastern values at between $12 million to $14 million
each. They range in age from 13 to 18 years old.
   ``We've offered to either sell them the planes or run the
operation for them, including flying the planes or anything in
between,'' Eastern executive Joseph Leonard said. ``Hopefully, we
can negotiate something.''
   A team of Aeroflot officials led by Alex Timofeev, general
director of the airline's Moscow division, has been in Miami for a
week talking with Eastern executives and test-flying the planes.
   The deal could be worth between $150 million and $200 million,
depending on Eastern's level of shared service, said Allen
Blattner, president of Jetborne International, who brought the two
parties together.
   Any deal is at least 30 to 60 days away, Blattner said. If an
agreement is reached, it would have to be approved by the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York, where Eastern has filed for Chapter
11 protection.

<TEXT>
   A union representing more than 5,000 teachers
and other school employees reached a tentative agreement Saturday
night that could end a three-week strike in Louisiana's largest
public school district.
   Nat LaCour, president of the United Teachers of New Orleans, and
Frank Fudesco, chief negotiator for the Orleans Parish School
Board, said an accord was reached on a three-year contract, but
refused to release details.
   LaCour said he would explain the offer to union members Sunday
night and recommend they vote to approve it in time to return to
work Monday.
   LaCour described the deal as a ``win-win situation.'' But Fudes
said: ``Quite frankly, there will be some cutbacks in some manner,
shape and form.''
   Since the strike began Sept. 17, many teachers in the nation's
27th largest school district have crossed picket lines. District
officials said 41 percent of the teachers were at work Friday,
compared with union estimates that 36 percent had broken the
strike.
   Striking teachers sought support Saturday afternoon near some
polling places as primary elections were being held statewide.
   Voters were asked to sign petitions seeking the recall of school
board president Carl Robinson and three other board members. Union
members accused them of failing to negotiate in good faith.
   The union sought higher salaries and improved health benefits in
a three-year contract. It had asked a federal mediator to join the
talks, but the school board refused his offer to intervene.
   Earlier Saturday, Fudesco said he was ``extremely disappointed''
that the union continued to demand more money, but that the board
would consider the request.
   LaCour said the money was available and union members deserved
it.
   ``The board has indicated that it has $3 million from a recent
bond sale, $3 million saved due to the strike, plus $2 million in
expected sales tax increases. That's $8 million,'' he said. ``I
think our demands can be met and this strike can be over in time
for schools to begin normal operations on Monday.''

   The Cuban Communist Party will allow local
elections by secret, direct ballot, the Cuban government news
agency Prensa Latina said, in an apparent move toward greater
democaracy.
   The party party wants to be more ``flexible to the
characteristics of the territory,'' the daily newspaper Granma
reported. The report Friday was picked up by Prensa Latina,
monitored in Mexico City.
   In elections scheduled for November through February, city and
provincial committees will be elected by secret and direct vote and
there will be 20 to 25 percent more candidates than committee
seats, Prensa Latina said.
   In another development, the Central Committee secretariat
reduced its own membership from seven members to five and the
committee's departments from 19 to nine in what is said was an
attempt to eliminate bureaucratic bloat.
   The agency quoted Granma as saying the committee wants to be an
example of ``the coherent and systematic effort that is required to
overcome the hypertrophy of the state aparatus, the administration
and the political organizations of the masses.''
   President Fidel Castro continues as first secretary of the
secretariat and his brother Raul as second secretary. Other members
are Ramon Machado, Julian Rizo and Carlos Aldana. Jorge Risquet,
who will continue as a member of the Politburo, and Brig. Gen.
Sergio Perez were removed.
   Perez headed the military department, which was replaced by a
military commission under the Politburo.
   Castro has said repeatedly that he will never surrender his
Socialist ideals or allow Socialism to fall as it did in Eastern
Europe. Since reforms began in the Soviet Union in 1985, aid to
Cuba from the Soviet Union and its former allies has fallen
steadily, and Cuba's economy is ailing.
   ``The revolution will face this special period without throwing
anyone into the street, without depriving a single citizen of his
resources, without leaving anyone jobless,'' Castro said late last
month.

   An undercover police drug sting operation
unofficially dubbed ``Operation Al Jolson'' because white
detectives wore blackface makeup netted 30 arrests but was branded
racist by black community leaders.
   Police halted the practice in the mostly black neighborhood of
River Park after news reports brought complaints, but officials
defended its use.
   ``Because the sales are made predominantly by blacks ... there's
no way (detectives) could get out there and sell drugs standing on
the corner looking the way they were,'' Naples Police Capt. Kevin
Rambosk said recently.
   The department in the southwestern Florida city of about 18,000
residents has one black on a force of about 75 officers. The
neighboring Collier County sheriff's department has 10 blacks on a
force of 407 officers.
   The shortage of black officers is no excuse for the racial
masquerade, a black leader said.
   ``The police seemed to be saying, `This is what a drug pusher
would look like,''' said Fran Haugabrook. ``In other words, `A drug
pusher is black.' It is offensive.''
   The Naples Daily News published a package of stories in August
about the controversial police technique. Shortly thereafter, a
group of 249 residents demanded an investigation by the FBI and the
attorneys general for Florida and the United States.
   Recently, Newsweek magazine carried a short but sharply worded
item on the blackface anti-drug tactic they dubbed ``Operation Al
Jolson.''

   Hurricane Klaus weakened to a
tropical storm Saturday and drifted into the open waters of the
Atlantic after leaving at least six dead and 1,500 homeless from
flooding in Martinique.
   Klaus' winds decreased from 75 mph to 65 mph early Saturday and
the National Hurricane Center in Miami said a further decrease in
strength was possible over the next 24 hours.
   The hurricane center lifted all storm warnings and watches that
had been in effect for the islands of the northeastern Caribbean,
but said small craft should avoid venturing into the northeast
Caribbean until winds and seas subside.
   The storm skirted Antigua on Friday, tearing roofs from houses
but causing no major damage.
   The storm moved from the northeastern Caribbean and into open
Atlantic waters, causing rough seas but reducing the threat to
island residents.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Klaus was centered near 19.1 degrees north
latitude and 62.6 degrees west longitude, or about 75 miles
north-northeast of St. Martin, according to the hurricane center.
Tropical storm-force winds extended 115 miles from its center.
   The system was moving northwest at about 5 mph and that general
motion was expected to continue for the next 24 hours.
   It was not known whether the storm would reach the continental
United States.
   Klaus was upgraded to a hurricane from a tropical storm Friday.
Tropical storms become hurricanes when winds reach a sustained
speed of 74 mph. Klaus is the 11th named storm and the sixth
hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season.
   The French island of Martinique south of the Leewards was by far
the hardest hit by the storm. Heavy rain since Tuesday spawned
landslides and serious flooding, blocking many roads and forcing
1,500 people from their homes. Authorities said six people were
killed, including two young sisters swept from a bridge, and two
fishermen were reported missing.
   Wind and flood damage also occurred on Barbados, Dominica and
St. Lucia, but no injuries were reported from those islands.
   St. Lucia's Banana Growers Association said about 15 percent of
this year's crop was destroyed. Damage was estimated at near $1
million.

the foundation said.
   ``The Scripps Howard Visiting Professional Chair will give the
school an infusion of fresh experience, providing students and
faculty another valuable link to the real world of working
journalists,'' said Albert Schottelkotte, foundation president.
   The foundation, established in 1962, gave its first grant of
$1.5 million to the school in 1983. E.W. Scripps Co. is the
Cincinnati-based media company founded by Edward Wyllis Scripps. It
owns newspapers, television and radio stations.

<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded outside the Finance
Department on Sunday hours after a bombing at Defense headquarters,
raising fears of continued unrest after a revolt ended on the
Philippines' second-largest island.
   Both explosions came after the rebel leader, Col. Alexander
Noble, surrendered and gave up his three-day secessionist revolt on
Mindanao island.
   The mutiny was crushed after troops loyal to President Corazon
Aquino bombed an army camp seized by rebels in Butuan city, 500
miles southeast of Manila. Noble, who took over another camp in
neighboring Cagayan de Oro province, 500 miles to the south, gave
up Saturday and was flown to Manila.
   Hours after Nobel surrendered, a bomb destroyed two jeeps and
injured one person outside Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos' office at
Camp Aguinaldo, a few yards where Noble was being detained.
   Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said rebel soldiers may have
set off that blast to get even with the recent blow to renegade
forces.
   The second bombing, on Sunday, hurt no one and destroyed a
cement plant box outside the Finance building.
   Police said both devices were the same type that rebel
right-wing soldiers have been using in a series of bombings in the
capital since mid-August.
   Guards closed the gates at the Camp Aguinaldo and barred anyone
from entering or leaving. The camp has been on alert since the
revolt erupted Thursday on Mindanao island.
   Sunday's blast was the 37th in the Manila area since Aug. 13 in
what the military believes is a terror campaign by rightist rebels.
   The bombs raised fears of more attacks by military dissidents
despite the failure of the seventh military rebellion during Mrs.
Aquino's 4{-year-old administration.
   Earlier Saturday, de Villa said Noble's arrest dealt a severe
blow to elements in the military who aim to topple the struggling
government.
   Mrs. Aquino told Filipinos in a televised address that ``the
constitution will be upheld with force if need be.'' She also asked
Congress to enact legislation increasing the penalty for rebellion
from six to 20 years imprisonment to life.
   Most Filipinos have little sympathy for military rebels. But the
inability of the governmnt to control the dissidents has
discredited a civilian administration that seems unable to deliver
basic services, control prices and guide national development.
   That concern has been reflected in the business community, which
is already alarmed over the prospects of economic decline brought
on by the Persian Gulf crisis and the effects a July earthquake
that killed more than 1,600 people.
   On Thursday, Noble's forces of about 800 soldiers, civilians and
militiamen seized a garrison in Butuan, about 70 miles east of
Cagayan de Oro. They were joined by about 150 elite Scout Rangers
in Iligan, a major industrial center in northern Mindanao.
   They declared independence for the southern island in a move
widely thought to be a prelude to an attack on the central
government in Manila.
   The government crushed the revolt, in part with bombing raids.
The uprising left one person dead, one wounded and one missing,
military officials said.
   Officials said all garrisons were back in government hands
Saturday. Government forces were rounding up Noble's followers, and
hundreds were already in custody, authorities said.
   Noble was escorted to Manila by Brig. Gen. Arturo Enrile,
superintendent of the Philippine Military Academy, and other armed
forces officials.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said Noble's chief civilian ally,
Reuben Canoy, also was arrested in Cagayan de Oro, where he once
served as mayor.
   De Villa blamed Noble's defeat on the failure of his allies to
come to his aid and instigate uprisings elsewhere in Mindanao.
   ``Certainly the surrender of Noble and the suppression of the
pocket rebellion in northern Mindanao will greatly weaken this
movement, which has been continuously bedeviling the country,'' de
Villa said.
   Despite his surrender, Noble claimed he achieved his objectives
of drawing attention to the problems of Mindanao.
   Noble, 42, was formerly chief of staff of Mrs. Aquino's guard
force, but he turned against her and joined the coup attempt in
December. He later fled to the jungles of northern Mindanao.

<TEXT>
   The rebellious republics of Croatia
and Slovenia published a document Saturday demanding that
Yugoslavia's federal system be refashioned into a loose
confederation of sovereign states.
   The document, drafted by the leadership of the two republics,
both of which are politically center-right, was published
simultaneously in Slovenia and Coatia.
   It proposed that the present six republics become
semi-independent states that would cooperate only for common
economic and political interests.
   Each member of this ``union of sovereign states'' would have its
own army and currency and could secede at any time.
   Yugoslavia, formed in 1918, has been a centralized federation
since the Communist takeover in 1945. It is governed by a
collective presidency.
   This Balkan nation of 23 million people has been torn by
traditional rivalries among various religious and ethnic groups.
Heightening the tensions have been recent political conflicts
between republics with democratically elected governments and those
still ruled by Communists.
   The Communist government in the largest republic of Serbia
strongly opposes turning Yugoslavia into a confederation. It
advocates ``a modern federation,'' with central rule remaining in
Belgrade.
   Slovenian President Milan Kucan has said the only alternative to
confederation would be breaking up Yugoslavia. He indicated
Slovenia would otherwise secede or form a confederation with
Croatia.
   Serbia's hardline President Slobodan Milosevic said recently
that if Yugoslavia becomes a confederation, Serbia would demand its
borders be changed to include about 500,000 Serbs now living in
Croatia.
   On Friday, a small national army unit occupied the headquarters
of Slovenia's regional defense forces in Ljubljana, the Slovenian
capital, in a bid to reassert federal authority.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Abortion Clinic Trespassing Charge Against Priest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL MONTE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A trespassing charge against a Roman
Catholic priest accused of blocking abortion clinic doors was
dismissed after a jury was unable to reach a verdict in the case.
   Municipal Court Judge Richard Van Dusen dismissed the charge
against the Rev. George Peter Irving on Friday after a jury
deadlocked 11-1 in favor of conviction.
   ``You're really dealing with a simple trespassing case that has
larger moral issues thrown in,'' Van Dusen said.
   Prosecutors unsuccessfully moved to retry the priest after Van
Dusen declared a mistrial. The judge said another jury was unlikely
to reach a verdict either.
   Irving, 37, was the first anti-abortion activist in Los Angeles
County permitted to use the so-called ``necessity defense,'' which
allows defendants to argue that they broke a law to prevent a
higher evil.
   Irving, associate pastor of Church of the Assumption, was
arrested Dec. 19, when 100 anti-abortion protesters gathered
outside Clinica Eva, a family planning clinic in El Monte.
   In several hundred similar anti-abortion trespassing cases,
prosecutors have successfully barred the ``necessity defense'' on
grounds abortion is legal and therefore does not pose a
``significant evil'' that would warrant breaking the law.
   The mistrial came as the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and parishes
around the country prepared for ``Respect Life Sunday.''
   Los Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahony urged all priests and
deacons to preach special anti-abortion sermons Sunday and
throughout the month.
   Operation Rescue anti-abortion leaders hailed the dismissal of
charges as a ``victory for unborn children,'' but abortion rights
activists said the judge's decision sent the wrong message.
   ``This says it's OK to be easy on a criminal just because he's
wearing a collar,'' said Robin Schneider, executive director of the
California Abortion Rights Action League.

   Tens of thousands of people
gathered in Bratislava, the capital of the Slovak republic,
demanding that Slovak be the only official language in the
republic, according to a news report Saturday.
   The rally by demonstrators from throughout Slovakia seemed
directed against the Hungarian minority of at least 570,000 living
in the Slovak republic, the daily Lidove Noviny reported. It
appeared to have nationalist overtones.
   Hungarian is used in some kindergartens and schools and in a few
teachers' training colleges. Plans exist to set up a
Hungarian-language university in Slovakia.
   Leaders of the separatist Slovak National Party want Slovak to
be the only official language.
   Slovak is similar to Czech, the language of the other republic
of Czechoslovakia.
   Speakers at the Bratislava rally also demanded creation of an
independent and sovereign Slovak state, the daily said.
Czechoslovakia is now a confederation. The only speaker who
supported confederation was jeered.

   Listen up, bachelors! Being single can be
deadly, according to a national study that says unmarried,
middle-aged men are twice as likely to die as those who have
spouses.
   And don't think living together will save your lives.
   ``Even single men who live with someone other than a spouse have
a higher death rate,'' Maradee Davis, primary author of the
university study, said Friday. ``It seems to be the presence of a
spouse that's protective.''
   Twenty-three percent of men ages 45 to 54 who lived without a
spouse died within 10 years, compared to 11 percent of similarly
aged men who lived with their wives, according to the study by
epidemiologists at the University of California at San Francisco.
   The study also found that 7.7 percent of women ages 45 to 54 who
lived without a spouse died within 10 years, compared to 4 percent
of the married women in the same age group.
   But overall, women's risk was linked to low income, not the type
of living arrangement, researchers said.
   The study analyzed data compiled by the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey. The 7,651 subjects from across the
United States ranged in age from 45 to 74 and were studied from
1971 to 1975 and then again from 1982 to 1984.
   Researchers theorize that both middle-aged men and women died
sooner than their married counterparts because of factors such as a
poor diet, alcohol consumption, smoking, a lack of exercise and low
income.
   Marriage apparently breeds better living habits, while the
single life often includes more drinking, smoking and perhaps too
many beer nuts and party snacks and not enough square meals.
   ``For men, the health behavior factors tended to explain the
difference (in death rates),'' said Davis, an associate professor
of epidemiology. ``In our society, men generally are not able to
take care of their everyday needs.
   ``But, for women, a high proportion of those who are single head
households and usually have low incomes.''
   Researchers also said they believe that men don't have as much
life-enhancing social support as women outside of marriage.
   ``Men derive a lot of social support by being married, but women
have a more widespread social support system outside of marriage,''
Davis said.
   Davis said researchers began the study, funded by the National
Institute on Aging, because of a concern about an increasing number
of older adults living alone in the United States.
   In the study group, slightly more than half of women ages 65 to
74 in the study were living alone or with someone other than a
spouse, compared to 19 percent of the men in the same age group.
   ``Because of the high divorce rate in the United States and the
trend toward older adults choosing to live alone if they are
widowed, there is a general concern about the social isolation,
health and well-being of older adults living alone,'' Davis said.
   Davis presented the study Thursday to the 118th annual meeting
of the American Public Health Association in New York City.

   Hundreds of protesters attacked two police
stations, set several government vehicles ablaze and burned down
part of the main market in this West African capital.
   The demonstrators turned violent Friday when soldiers forced
them out of a courtroom during the trial of two people accused of
distributing tracts that were deemed hostile to the military
government of Gen. Gnassingbe Eyadema.
   Eyadema seized power in a coup in 1967 and rules this nation as
a one-party state.
   The content of the tracts was not immediately available, but
many African countries have been hit by a wave of unrest this year
as demonstrators demand multiparty democracy. The protests had not
touched Togo, however.
   Those expelled from the court spread out across town, with two
groups attacking two police stations and others stoning and setting
fire to government vehicles.
   Other protesters set stalls ablaze in the main market.
   Calm returned in the middle of the day after soldiers were
stationed at intersections and othe strategic points in the
capital.

   Murder charges against a son of President
Kenneth Kaunda in the shooting death of a 20-year-old woman were
dropped, court officials said.
   A court in Lusaka instead ordered Kambarage Kaunda, 26, to face
manslaughter charges, a spokesman at the Lusaka magistrate's court
said Friday.
   Rafique Mulla, accused with Kaunda of involvement in the
shooting last year, was acquitted by Lusaka magistrate Peter
Chitengi during a hearing Friday, said the spokesman, who by custom
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Attorneys for Kaunda had asked for a court ruling on whether
police had sufficient evidence to charge him with murder.
   Prosecutors say the woman, Tabeth Mwanza, was a former
girlfriend of Kaunda and that the two quarreled before the shooting
in September 1989.
   Kaunda pleaded innocent during earlier hearings and said he
opened fire in self-defense when a mob hurled stones at his car in
Lusaka. Kaunda, one of the Zambian president's seven children, said
he did not know the dead woman.

   NEUILLY-SUR-MARNE, France (AP) - A man who said he was upset by
a group of noisy youths in a low-rent housing district fired a
rifle shot at them, killing a 19-year-old with a wound to the
heart, police said.
   Khemissi Karar died moments after the Thursday night shooting at
the Cite des Fauvettes, east of Paris, one of numerous high-rise
developments that house low-income residents, often immigrants.
   Police said Friday they found the murder weapon during their
investigation of the apartment tower from where the shot was fired.
They did not identify the suspect.
   Karar, a Frenchman born in Algeria, was talking loudly with two
friends at the foot of the tower when the shot was fired, police
said.
   ``Khemissi was anything but mean,'' said his friend Mustapha,
18, who was with him when the shooting occurred. He said people in
the building often ``threw objects, tomatoes or bear cans'' when
young people gathered below to talk.

   Much of the federal government shut down at
midnight Friday, victim to a deepening budget standoff between the
White House and Congress.
   ``The hour of reckoning is at hand,'' President Bush said in a
statement Friday night. The president refused to sign or veto
11th-hour legislation passed by Congress restoring the government's
power to spend money, choosing instead to let the shutdown
commence.
   ``The president simply feels we ought to quit fooling around,''
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. ``Surely the reality
of a government shutdown will convince everyone a solution should
be found.''
   The budget dispute has prevented Congress from approving any
appropriations bills for the fiscal year that began Monday,
effectively leaving the government with no money.
   The U.S. Constitution states, ``No money shall be drawn from the
Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law.''
   Only those services needed to ``protect life and property'' were
to continue in the absence of a budget, White House budget director
Richard Darman wrote in a memo to agency chiefs.
   With the long holiday weekend about to start, it seemed likely
that the full brunt of the shutdown would not be felt until
Tuesday. But the Park Service was preparing to close the Statue of
Liberty, the Washington Monument and other tourist favorites, at
least for the weekend.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell criticized Bush for his
decision.
   ``I believe it is inflicting needless pain and anguish on
thousands of American families and I do not believe it is creating
the kind of atmosphere that enhances the chances for an
agreement,'' said Mitchell, D-Maine.
   The Senate sent the measure to Bush on a voice vote Friday
night, shortly after Democrats rammed it through the House by a
tally of 300-113. The measure, fully financing the government
through next Friday, even got some Republican support in the House.
   The president has 10 days to sign or veto the bill, but
Fitzwater said Bush hoped to have a budget solution in hand
``before that.''
   ``I don't know what the answer is right now,'' said Rep. Silvio
Conte, R-Mass. ``But I do know one thing. Chaos is not the
answer.''
   Congress planned a Saturday session - and possible sessions
throughout the three-day Columbus Day weekend - because of the
fiscal standoff.
   The specter of federal agencies having no funds to operate arose
after the House early Friday resoundingly defeated a budget
agreeent worked out by Bush and congressional leaders.
   As lawmakers began trying to put together new packages, they
revived talk of perhaps cutting the capital gains tax rate and
raising income tax rates for the rich.
   To boost pressure on budget writers to forge a spending plan for
the five-day-old fiscal year, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Bush would not sign any such temporary financing
bill.
   ``We would close down the government at midnight'' Friday unless
Congress completes a broad budget outline by then, Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said Bush followed the debate in the House on cable
television in the family living quarters at the White House.
   Most of the nation's 2.4 million federal workers were told to
report on Tuesday - after Monday's federal holiday - even if only
to be sent home after they arrived.
   Congressional leaders of both parties met with administration
officials to grope for a deficit-cutting plan that would be
acceptable to lawmakers just a month shy of Election Day.
   Democrats sought support for a new plan with fewer cuts for the
elderly and the poor, but there were no signs that Republicans were
willing to accept it.
   Democrats also said they would be willing to consider cuts in
the capital gains tax rate, a Republican proposal, in exchange for
higher taxes for the rich. Budget negotiators had rejected the
tradeoff last week.
   Earlier, in a Thursday night session that stretched into Friday
morning, a rebellious House overwhelmingly defeated the
$500-billion compromise package of tax boosts and spending slashes
that Bush and congressional leaders preferred.
   That vote was an embarrassment to administration officials and
top lawmakers of both parties, who had waged an all-out lobbying
thrust on behalf of the measure. Uncertainty reigned on Capitol
Hill.
   ``This thing could be - who knows?'' said a confused Rep. Robert
Matsui, D-Calif.
   Democrats hoped that by sending the emergency spending bill to
Bush, the president - and not Congress - would be blamed for the
closure.
   But lawmakers of both parties agreed that all sides looked bad
in light of the seemingly endless budget battle.
   Rep. Jack Buechner, R-Mo., tugged on a tie bearing a Mickey
Mouse pattern and said, ``Everybody ought to have these on today.''
   The House's 254-179 rejection of the budget was driven by
unhappiness among members of all stripes. Conservatives disliked
its $134 billion in taxes and as well as its spending cuts they
considered overly gentle.
   Liberals thought the $60 billion in Medicare reductions,
including cuts in benefits, were too steep. They said the plan's
higher levies on gasoline, heating oil, tobacco and alcohol would
hit the poor too hard.
   And members of both parties said they resented the process by
which the package was written - four months of closed-door summit
talks involving only congressional leaders and administration
officials.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he believed that as
a result, lawmakers should try to write a budget themselves,
perhaps with reduced Medicare cuts and a lesser tax burden for
low-income people.
   ``We will, of course, keep in touch with the White House, but I
do not anticipate ... the resumption of anything that would be
called summit talks,'' he said.
   Foley said he wanted a budget that would be supported by a
majority of Democrats and Republicans. ``I am not of the opinion
that political warfare is of some value at this point,'' he said.
   But not all lawmakers agreed. Conservative Republicans urged
Bush to keep the government shut down until Democrats agreed to
limit federal spending.
   ``A budget plan ought to be put together by the president in
consultation with Republicans,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
``Tell the Democrats to put up their best shot. We'll sustain every
veto he's got.''

   In the early 1970s, Robert Mapplethorpe took his
first photographs with a Polaroid camera. It was the perfect tool
for radical art. What was radical about his work was not so much
the subject matter but the process and materials he applied to a
stagnant form, adding fabric, texture, tone.
   Form and technique, however, are not what spring to mind these
days when considering the late artist. Today, it is the rough
images he immortalized - oral sex, bondage, homosexual fondling -
that give him an important place in 20th-century art.
   Perhaps Mapplethorpe never fully realized his destiny as an
artist. He died in March 1989 at the age of 42 of complications
from acquired immune deficiency syndrome. In death, he has become a
symbol for artistic freedom.
   On Friday, a jury acquitted the Contemporary Arts Center in
Cincinnati, and its director, Dennis Barrie, of pandering obscenity
and using children in nudity-related material.
   The charges were prompted by the exhibit ``Robert Mapplethorpe:
The Perfect Moment,'' which had a seven week-run last spring and
drew more than 80,000 people, an attendance record for an art
exhibit in Cincinnati. The show closes this week in Boston.
   A Mapplethorpe exhibit last year at the Corcoran Gallery of Art
in Washington was canceled after Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., declared
some of the artist's photographs to be obscene. Helms' objections
resulted in a move by Congress to limit federal funds to the arts.
   ``I wasn't starting out to make a statement, that isn't the way
I work,'' Mapplethorpe once said. ``The statement grows out of what
I do.''
   In his 1976-77 work ``Bill,'' Mapplethorpe placed a mirror
between two panels of a man masturbating. The idea is to have the
viewer seehhim or herself flanked by two erect penises.
   He used the same technique in 1979's ``Easter Lilies With
Mirror.'' Here, four panels form a cross around a center mirror.
The lilies are shown in dramatic shadows, a dusting of light
illuminating their inner and almost religious beauty.
   It is a way of engaging the viewer beyond mere voyeurism; the
viewer becomes a part of the work.
   The intense shadow composition of the triptych ``Jim and Tom,
Sausalito'' (1977-78) is obliterated by the action in the picture,
in which one man urinates on another. Around the same time,
Mapplethorpe did a self-portrait, posed partly naked in leather
with the handle of a bullwhip in his rectum.
   They are among his most disturbing photographs, from a period in
which he unraveled a violent homosexual mystique for an
unsuspecting audience. They are terrifying, sadomasochistic
tableaux - chained men, leather-bound men, men prepared for pain in
an aristocratic setting.
   But despite the frightening and sometimes sickening roughness of
these sexual and psychological images, Mapplethorpe succeeded in
crafting a rich tonal range.
   ``He was involved in an incredibly wide variety of life, the
other side of which is death,'' said the artist Lowell Nesbitt, who
first met and befriended Mapplethorpe in 1971-72.
   ``It's very clear that much of his photographs were mirrors of
his personal life. I think that Mapplethorpe really wanted to be
censored. He was pushing for it. He was pushing the artistic
barriers, the way many artists have in the past, to see how far he
could push before he could met a boundary.''
   Back in the early '70s, a time of rainbow drugs and easy sex, of
troubled politics and an unpopular war, Mapplethorpe was into
refashioning jewelry by adding materials to customize a piece for
the owner.
   Mapplethorpe was one of six children born to Joan and Harry
Mapplethorpe. He fled his Catholic childhood in Floral Park,
Queens, for the bohemian earthiness of Brooklyn in the 1960s.
There, he received his art education at Pratt Institute.
   It also was there that he encountered and forged a lasting
friendship with radical poet and musician Patti Smith. He spent his
artistic lifetime photographing her, in pictures ranging from early
Polaroids to the portrait he used on her 1988 LP, ``Dream of
Life.''
   He did portraits of actor Richard Gere, artists Louise Nevelson
and Alice Neel, lawyer Roy Cohn, body builder Lisa Lyon and
transvestite Candy Darling. And they were as varied as his
classically poetic studies of flowers, fruit and vegetables.
   Mapplethorpe's eye consumed more than merely the flat surface of
a photo. He infused light and shadow, certainly, but he also
applied textures and tones, using fabric and paint such as platinum
on linen or mesh wire overlays. His early work utilized collage for
drama and movement.
   In his last years, his work was austere. A 1988 picture titled
``Nipple'' could be a parched desert, the moon's surface or a dried
river bed. But it is a closeup of the human form.

   Here is a chronology of events in the
obscenity case based on photographs by the late Robert
Mapplethorpe:
   -April 1987-Dec. 1988: Mapplethorpe assembles an exhibition
called ``Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment'' in consultation
with Janet Kardon, curator of the Institute for Contemporary Art in
Philadelphia.
   -Oct. 1988: Dennis Barrie, the director of the Contemporary Arts
Center in Cincinnati, decides to display the exhibit, calling it
``the most stunning photographic show I'd seen in years.''
   -March 1989: Mapplethorpe dies at age 42 of AIDS in Boston.
   -June 1989: The Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., cancels a
planned Mapplethorpe exhibition. The gallery director says she
acted to defuse debate over government support to the arts.
   -March 16, 1990: Hamilton County Sheriff Simon L. Leis Jr. says
in an interview that he considers parts of the planned 175-picture
exhibition legally obscene and says he plans to take legal action
if Cincinnati police don't act.
   -March 27: The Contemporary Arts Center files a lawsuit seeking
a court ruling on whether the pictures are obscene before the
exhibition opens.
   -April 2: Cincinnati police vice officers review the
Mapplethorpe exhibition at the gallery's request, but decline to
file charges.
   -April 6: A Hamilton County Municipal Court judge dismisses the
gallery's lawsuit. The exhibition opens with a private showing to
more than 4,000 dues-paying gallery patrons.
   -April 7: The exhibition opens to the public, and more than
8,000 see it the first day. A county grand jury indicts the
Contemporary Arts Center and Barrie on misdemeanor counts of
pandering obscenity and using children in material involving
nudity. The indictment covers five pictures depicting sex acts and
two showing children with their genitals exposed.
   -April 8: U.S. District Judge Carl B. Rubin issues an injunction
barring police from seizing the photographs at the gallery.
   -April 16: Barrie and the Contemporary Arts Center plead
innocent before Judge David J. Albanese in Hamilton County
Municipal Court.
   -April 19: County Prosecutor Arthur M. Ney turns the case over
to city prosecutors, saying his office cannot handle it because it
involves only misdemeanor charges.
   -April 23: The Association of Art Museum Directors, which
represents directors of 176 museum directors in the United States
and Canada, promises to pay any fine imposed on Barrie and the
Contemporary Arts Center.
   -May 26: The exhibition closes after more than 81,000 people pay
to see it, making it the largest arts event in Cincinnati history.
   -June 20: Albanese, rejecting defense arguments that the
artistic quality of two pictures of children make them immune from
child-nudity law, orders Barrie and the gallery to stand trial
Sept. 24 on the child-nudity charge.
   -Aug. 1: The exhibit opens in Boston at the Institute for
Contemporary Art.
   -Sept. 5, 1990: A Municipal Court clerk in Boston refuses a
request by critics of the show to file obscenity charges.
   -Sept. 6: Albanese rules that jurors in Barrie's trial will
consider only the seven photos named in the indictment, saying they
need to find that only one of the pictures is obscene to return a
conviction. The judge orders Barrie and the gallery to stand trial
Sept. 24 on the obscenity charge.
   -Sept. 24, 1990: The trial begins.
   -Oct. 2: Mrs. Kardon testifies that she considered the pictures
to be artistically important. She says she found the pictures of
the two children non-sexual and morally innocent.
   -Oct. 3: Barrie testifies in his own defense, saying he
recognized the controversial nature of the photos before the
exhibition began. But he says Mapplethorpe was an important artist
whose work the public should be able to see.
   -Oct. 4: Judith Reisman, the prosecution's only expert witness,
testifies that the photos of sex acts lack artistic value and that
the photos of the children could encourage child abuse.
   -Oct. 5: Jurors deliberate just two hours before finding Barrie
and the Contemporary Arts Center innocent on all charges. The
exhibit closes in Boston, after 103,000 people paid to see the
photographs.

<HEAD>House OKs Catchall Crime Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tough, election-year crime bill that became
a catchall for House members intent on sending a law-and-order
message to voters is headed to a compromise committee with a veto
threat attached.
   The House passed the bill, 368-55, Friday after first adopting a
lengthy list of amendments.
   Most stiffened penalties and criminal law. But the House also
backed a provision barring execution of prisoners who can show that
their death sentence was imposed because of racial discrimination.
   The administration has strongly opposed that provision, and
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh issued a statement reiterating
that President Bush will veto ``a bill that imposes racial quotas
on our death penalty laws.''
   The bill goes back to the Senate, which has passed its own
version, and then to a conference committee to resolve differences.
   Among other amendments adopted by the House was one allowing the
government to seize the homes of savings and loan executives
convicted of fraud and who were using state homestead laws to keep
their residences - even when they are multimillion-dollar mansions.
   Another established minimum penalties for sale of drugs within
1,000 feet of a truck stop or highway rest area.
   The House voted 216-204 to reject an amendment that would have
removed a racial justice provision for the appeal of death penalty
cases.
   That provision would allow death row inmates to use racial
statistics in their appeals to show the sentencing courts were
biased, and bars execution of prisoners who demonstrate their death
sentence was imposed because of racial discrimination.
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., offered the amendment to
delete the provision, with supporters saying it would dramatically
weaken and perhaps abolish use of the death penalty.
   Backers said there was indisputable evidence that blacks are
more likely to be sentenced to die than are whites.
   Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., cited what he said was an
``incredible fact: never in the history of this country has a white
man been convicted and executed for killing a black man or any
minority.''
   ``As far as I'm concerned that makes the case there has been
discrimination in the imposition of capital punishment,'' Slattery
said.
   Congressional staffers said that assertion covered the more than
125 executions carried out since capital punishment resumed in
1977. The Supreme court approved new state death penalty laws in
1976, replacing those struck down by the court as unconstitutional
in their application in 1972.
   The House adopted another amendment lessening the burden of
proof on the government to counter such evidence.
   The Senate excluded such a provision when it passed its version
of the crime bill. Bush and congressional conservatives have been
highly critical of the racial provision.
   In his statement, Attorney General Thornburgh clled on House
and Senate conferees to ``delete this misguided provision and send
to the president's desk a bill which does not nullify the death
penalty.''
   ``Unfortunately, the House bill as passed would have the effect
of nullifying many state death sentences now in effect and would
threaten future enforcement of the death penalty at both the
federal level and in the 37 states with capital punishment laws,''
Thornburgh said.
   A dozen more crimes would be subject to the federal death
penalty and executions would be carried out more quickly, as a
result of amendments added to the bill.
   ``I hope we never bring up another crime bill a month before an
election,'' said Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J.. He complained during
the debate that campaign considerations were overshadowing all
else.

   President Bush summoned congressional leaders
to the White House and began closing down the government today in
an attempt to pressure lawmakers into reaching a bipartisan budget
compromise.
   ``The president believes they need to get on with the job and
settle this issue right now,'' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said at a Friday night news briefing during which he
blamed the 12:01 a.m. shutdown on Congress.
   ``The president simply feels we ought to quit fooling around,''
Fitzwater said. ``Surely the reality of a government shutdown will
convince everyone a solution should be found.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, returned the
favor. He told reporters that Bush was responsible for the shutdown
because his people insisted on ``the very positions which led to
the defeat'' of the proposed budget.

   CINCINNATI (AP) - Sexually graphic photos by Robert Mapplethorpe
have artistic value, a jury ruled in acquitting an art gallery and
its director of obscenity charges in a closely watched trial.
   A Hamilton County Municipal Court jury Friday cleared
Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis
Barrie, of one count each of pandering obscenity and using children
in nudity-related photos in the exhibit, ``Robert Mapplethorpe: The
Perfect Moment.''
   Barrie said he was grateful at the outcome in the nation's first
obscenity trial of an art gallery, but lamented that battles over
artistic freedom were still being waged.
   ``I'm glad this fight is over in Cincinnati, but it's not over
in the rest of our country,'' he said. ``I will be in a number of
cities speaking about this issue.''

   MANILA, Philippines (AP) - The leader of a military revolt on
the country's second-largest island surrendered today, ending the
latest attempt to overthrow Corazon Aquino's struggling government.
   The military chief of staff, Gen. Renato de Villa, said the
arrest dealt a severe blow to those trying to topple the president.
It was the seventh military rebellion during her 4{-year
administration.
   ``Let me be precise once again in stating that the constitution
will be upheld with force if need be,'' Mrs. Aquino said in a
television address.
   The uprising's leader, Col. Alexander Noble, gave up early today
at a military garrison he seized in Cagayan de Oro, 500 miles south
of Manila.
   ---&equals;
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Iraq told U.N. members that the United
States and its allies are trying to control the world's oil
reserves, but the U.S. ambassador dismissed the charges as lies.
   Other opponents of Iraq, including the Soviet Union and exiled
Kuwaiti leaders, joined Friday in the angry replies to Iraq's
latest accusations, made in a speech at the United Nations. Saudi
Arabia's ambassador said Iraq had committed ``an unforgivable
crime, a crime to shine in the history of crimes'' by invading
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   In Washington, there was renewed worry about Iraq's military
potential. Five senators called for a Pentagon study of how Iraq
might have gained control of technology to make so-called fuel-air
explosives.
   Such bombs carry 10 times the power of conventional explosives
without the fallout of nuclear weapons. Military officials say the
United States has no ready defense against the explosives, which
could devastate oil fields, air bases and troops, the Los Angeles
Times reported.

   AURORA, Colo. (AP) - A housewife constantly racing to keep up
with her active 4-year-old son has found a high-tech way to get him
home in a hurry - she beeps him.
   ``When Jonathan's beeper goes off, he is home, which is nice. He
can't argue; he can't say, `Just a minute,' '' said Pat Hammett.
``It's convenient in that I don't have to stand out and yell for
five minutes and be one of those screaming mothers.''
   The beepers designed for children are the creation of Leslie and
John Gilmore, who founded Kid Konnection in this Denver suburb
about a month ago.
   The pagers come in brightly colored cases that can be worn on a
child's waist. They can be leased for $14 to $18 a month, which
pays for the beeper and the paging service, Mrs. Gilmore said.
