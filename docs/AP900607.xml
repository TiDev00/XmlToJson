   FBI agents arrested a former Army sergeant in
Tampa, Fla., Thursday night on charges he conspired to pass
sensitive information about the defense of Europe to Hungary and
Czechoslovakia, the Justice Department said.
   Roderick James Ramsay, 28, worked in West Germany directly under
Clyde Lee Conrad, a retired U.S. Army sergeant who was convicted of
treason by a West German court and given a life sentence earlier
this week. Ramsay was arrested without incident, the FBI said.
   Ramsay was accused of conspiring to gather and deliver defense
information to a foreign government, the FBI said. The Justice
Department said in a news release that the information included
sensitive plans for the defense of Central Europe and the use of
tactical nuclear weapons by U.S. forces and NATO allies.
   ``We can't give details, but it's fair to say the information
would have been very useful to the Soviet Union,'' U.S. Attorney
Robert W. Genzman said at a late-night news conference in Tampa.
   Ramsay was held at an undisclosed location in the Tampa area and
will appear before a federal magistrate on Friday, Genzman said.
   Neither Guzman nor FBI agents would say how many people overall
were involved in the alleged spy ring, and the Justice Department's
announcement referred to the investigation as ``continuing.''
   Court papers filed in the case in Tampa charge that for $20,000
Ramsay gave Conrad the documents as well as technical manuals about
military communications technology and material about the
coordination of NATO forces.
   The material was passed to the Hungarian and Czechoslovakian
intelligence services, according to the court papers.
   An affidavit filed in court and made available in Washington
noted that in January, 1986, Conrad visited Ramsay and gave him a
cow bell. Conrad told Ramsay that anyone displaying a similar cow
bell was involved in the spy ring, the affidavit said.
   The Justice Department said that several search warrants were
being served by FBI agents in conjunction with Ramsay's arrest.
   Ramsay served from 1983 through 1985 in the 8th Infantry Division
G-3 plans section in Bad Kreuznach as the assistant document
custodian, the Justice Department said in a news release. The G-3
section of a division is in charge of the military operations of the
unit.
   His duties included safeguarding all classified and military
documents and he held a top secret clearance, working directly under
Conrad.
   The affidavit charged that in December, 1985, Ramsay videotaped
hundreds of documents and made them available to Conrad for their
eventual sale to the Czechs and Hungarians.
   The case was an outgrowth of the investigation of Conrad, the FBI
said.
   FBI Director William S. Sessions said the investigation was one
of the most complicated of its kind ever undertaken by the bureau,
and the information passed on was ``extremely sensitive.''
   Conrad was arrested in August 1988. The trial judge in his case
said his offense, passing secrets to Hungary and Czechoslovakia from
1975 through 1985 in return for $1.2 million, ``endangered the
entire defense capability of the West'' and could have led to ``a
breakdown in the defenses of the western alliance,'' and to
``capitulation and the use of nuclear weapons on German territory.''
   In reporting Wednesday night that Ramsay had been targeted by the
FBI, ABC News said the Conrad-Ramsay espionage ring had smuggled
computer parts from the United States to the East Bloc through
Canada.
   But a top official in the chief federal prosecutor's office in
Karlsruhe, Alexander Prechtel, said Thursday that Conrad had turned
over ``defense strategic papers.'' He denied that smuggling of
computer parts was involved.
   The documents concerned NATO and American troops in Germany and
Europe, Prechtel said, but he would not elaborate.
   ``Normally everything goes to the Soviet Union, but we can only
prove the way to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and the rest is
speculation,'' Prechtel said.
   According to court records, Conrad was introduced to the
Hungarian secret service in late autumn 1975 by his supervisor in
the 8th Infantry Division, former U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Zoltan
Szabo.
   Szabo, who was convicted of espionage in Austria in 1989,
received a 10-month suspended sentence. He identified for
investigators some of the documents the court said Conrad sold to
the Hungarians.
   Conviction of espionage conspiracy carries a maximum penalty of
life imprisonment.

<HEAD>War of Words Produces New Climate of Tension in Middle East</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>

   A new climate of tension pervades the Middle
East, and Israeli officials fear an increasingly strident war of
words could escalate into a broader conflict.
   ``I would say the region is entering a dangerous new phase. It's
not simple rhetoric,'' said Gerald Steinberg, a Middle East expert
at Bar Ilan University near Tel Aviv.
   Israel's major worry is President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, who has
threatened to respond to any Israeli attack by using weapons of mass
destruction such as poison gas to destroy ``half of Israel.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has countered with a warning that
Israel will ``defend itself'' if necessary.
   Adding to the tension is a recent Palestinain raid, Israel's long
political crisis, the Likud government's refusal to participate in
peace talks and the furor in Arab countries over immigration of
Soviet Jews to Israel.
   Iraq's potential to produce biological weapons and its alleged
desire for nuclear weapons are especially worrisome when coupled
with its development of long-range missiles and reported plans to
build a giant gun capable of hitting Israel.
   Israeli officials and independent analysts said they did not
expect Iraq or other Arab nations to launch a deliberate attack now.
But they said the atmosphere of tension and escalating rhetoric
could trigger an unintended conflict.
   Yossi Olmert, director of the Government Press Office, said:
``The situation is one in which talk of peace has stopped and talk
of war has started.''
   Iraq has already made moves that Israel considers threatening.
   For example, Israeli officials and analysts said Iraq staged a
ground forces exercise near the border with Jordan, moved missiles
closer to Israel in extreme western Iraq and set up a joint air
squadron with Jordan that brought Iraqi pilots to the Israeli
frontier.
   Sources who spoke on condition of they not be identified said the
new Iraqi threat added to Israel's defense burden, requiring the
military to go on alert when Iraq moved forces in ways that could
endanger Israel.
   Also, the prospect of a new round of Palestinian terrorism has
increased dramatically following a PLO faction's attempted seaborne
raid on May 30 aimed at beachfront hotels on the Jewish holiday of
Shavuot.
   Mohammed Abbas, head of the Palestine Liberation Front which
launched the raid, told the Kuwait daily al-Watan that it was ``the
beginning of a combat effort against the Israeli enemy.''
   Israeli security officials fear Soviet Jewish immigrants may
become the next targets as they travel from Moscow to Israel via
transit points in east Europe such as Bucharest, Romania, and
Budapest, Hungary.
   The foiled terror attack was a reprisal for the May 20 massacre
of seven unarmed Arab laborers by an Israeli who authorities said
was deranged.
   Eighteen Palestinians and two Israelis died in subsequent rioting
and violence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip that gave new
impetus to the 30-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   Shamir's right-wing government has been blamed for provoking
tensions by encouraging new Jewish settlements in occupied areas,
and rejecting U.S. terms for a dialogue with Palestinians in Cairo.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain called on Israel
recently to engage Palestinians in negotiations. ``A tremor of
danger may shake the region and if things drift further, we risk a
damaging escalation of violence,'' he told reporters.
   Aharon Levran, a retired Israeli brigadier general, said that
without assurance of Soviet military and political support the Arabs
were unlikely to risk launching a war. ``I don't see the Arabs going
to war now against Israel when the international circumstances are
not right,'' Levran said.
   Joseph Alpher of the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in Tel
Aviv said, ``One cannot ignore the possibility that rhetoric will
turn into an inter-Arab commitment to genuinely escalate matters.''
   He said Israel's protracted political crisis and Shamir's refusal
to engage in peace talks weakened Israel's relationship with the
United States and made Israel look more vulnerable to radical Arab
states.
   Israel could do much to defuse tensions by starting a dialogue
with Palestinians and assuring the Arabs that Israel would not
subsidize or encourage Soviet Jews to settle on occupied land, he
said.
   ``It's within our power to set things right,'' Alpher said.
   Dore Gold, also an analyst at the Jaffee Center, said too much
attention had been given to the Palestinian problem while the
overall Arab-Israeli arms race was ignored.
   ``I think things can slip out of control unless a strong effort
is made to promote declaratory confidence building measures among
Middle East nations,'' he said.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Searches for Missing British Woman Near Virgin Islands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard has begun searching the waters
near the Virgin Islands for a 77-year-old British noblewoman missing
with the small airplane she was piloting, federal authorities said
Thursday night.
   Mary Pomeroy was flying a Piper 28 aircraft from the Dutch-French
island of St. Martin to St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands when
her plane disappeared Tuesday, said Fred Farrar, a spokesman for the
Federal Aviation Administration.
   A Piper 28 is a single-engine plane, and the distance from St.
Martin to St. Croix is about 100 miles.
   Farrar said details were sketchy but it was believed that Ms.
Pomeroy was countess of Malta or duchess of Malta. In the British
nobility, the name of a place attached to a title does not have to
be in Britain.
   However, reference books on the British nobility list her only as
the sister of Thomas de Vautort Pomeroy, 10th viscount of Harberton.
The reference material gives her home as the Isle of Wight.
   Ms. Pomeroy was alone in the airplane when it left St. Martin
about 3:05 p.m. Tuesday, flying under visual flight rules, Farrar
said. She radioed about seven minutes later that she was in level
flight at about 4,500 feet, and that was the last transmission from
the plane.
   A squall line had been reported between St. Martin and St. Croix
about that time, Farrar said.
   The search for Ms. Pomeroy did not begin until Wednesday because
it was initially reported that she had turned back to St. Martin,
Farrar said.
   Coast Guard helicopters, a C-130 airplane and a cutter searched
an area about 40 miles from St. Martin but found nothing, he said.

<HEAD>Columbia to be Returned to Hangar, Delaying Astro Mission</HEAD>

   Columbia will have to be rolled back
to the hangar next week so NASA can repair a hydrogen leak, a move
that leaves the shuttle's astronomy mission up in the air and
disrupts the year's flight plans.
   ``Safety's the first priority, and we've got an item here which
we absolutely have got to put to bed and we're going to do that,''
launch director Bob Sieck said Wednesday.
   The leak had forced NASA to scrub last week's launch of the
shuttle with the $150 million Astro observatory.
   On Wednesday, a test in which super-cold liquid hydrogen was
pumped into Columbia's big external fuel tank confirmed the leak is
in a tight cavity between two metal plates that connect the orbiter
and the tank, Sieck said.
   To fix the leak, the orbiter will have to be separated from the
tank in the hangar, he said. Even then, it will be hard to pinpoint
the leak because it seems to occur under extremely cold conditions
only, Sieck said.
   Sieck declined to estimate when Columbia might be able to lift
off. NASA officials have said it will take about a month to return
the shuttle to the hangar and perform repairs. The move will take
place sometime next week.
   The Astro mission is one of six remaining shuttle flights
scheduled for 1990. It's virtually certain now one of the missions
will be pushed into next year or later because of Columbia's
problems. But Sieck said preparations for Atlantis' secret military
flight in July will continue.
   Shuttles have been moved from the launch pad back to the hangar
twice because of mechanical failures and once because of payload
problems.
   When last week's launch attempt was scrubbed, Columbia's mission
already was two weeks late because of cooling system repairs.
   ``It's always disappointing when the hardware is bad to you, and
that looks like what we've got here,'' Sieck said. ``But we're
reminded it's a complex system and things don't always go for the
plan.''
   Astro, an on-board observatory consisting of three ultraviolet
telescopes and one X-ray telescope, was to have gone up in 1986. But
the Challenger explosion postponed the mission, depriving NASA of
the chance to see Halley's Comet.
   Comet Austin, discovered last year, is on its way out of the
solar system, and the chances of seeing it grow slimmer every day.

   Debra Gilbert was in her nightgown fixing
breakfast when an ax broke through the front door. As a dozen police
officers waving shotguns swarmed her house, she heard her husband
yell, ``She doesn't know anything. She doesn't know.''
   What she didn't know was that her husband of four years was
connected to the mob. She didn't know he had killed three times. And
she didn't know the shambles her life would become.
   Yet even after she knew, she stood by him when he agreed to
testify against organized crime buddies, living a bizarre life of
fear that included time in a three-room police station apartment.
   She watched as her husband manipulated authorities, serving his
murder sentence while living the high life complete with
thousand-dollar expense accounts and beach house vacations. When
Peter Gilbert died of a heart attack in June 1988, he still was in
custody, but was driving alone to go skydiving, in a Buick stocked
with cocaine.
   ``I know a lot of people out there would say, `Boy, she's the
biggest fool who ever walked this earth,''' Mrs. Gilbert said in an
interview at her Brooksville, Fla., home. But ``how many people can
say they loved someone enough to love them blindly?''
   The case of Peter Gilbert offers an unusual glimpse into the
sometimes peculiar world of crime and punishment, where a man so
skilled in manipulation can take not only his wife for a ride, but
also police and prosecutors.
   His escapade rocked Providence's police department and led Gov.
Edward D. DiPrete to order a state police investigation. Fourteen
officers face disciplinary action for unprofessional conduct, and a
special prosecutor was named April 30 to take the case to a grand
jury for possible criminal indictments.
   A state judge is even considering overturning a conviction that
was based on Peter Gilbert's testimony because of all the lies.
   The ``fiasco,'' as the internal investigation calls it, is
expected to cost nearly $1 million by the time all the probes are
completed.
   ``Then the state of Rhode Island and especially myself will be
able to put pieces together and not feel like there is anything
missing anymore,'' Mrs. Gilbert said.
   A consummate con man, Peter Gilbert made up in charisma what he
lacked in conscience. He told Debra their marriage was his first,
when it was at least his fifth. Standing 5 feet 5 inches, with a
scruffy beard and tattoos, Peter hardly seemed the lady's man. Debra
knew he had children, but she wasn't one to ask a lot of questions.
   When they met in Florida, she was a high school dropout with
three young children. Peter lived next door when the man she had
married at 16 walked out.
   ``He was my hero that came along and loved me and my children,''
she said in her soft Southern lilt.
   She married him in 1981 in the Brooksville courthouse, believing
he was James Harold Cassidy. The charade crumbled a year later when
he was arrested for burglarizing a church and a lumberyard. Police
said he was Peter Gilbert, a man who lived half his life as a
criminal.
   ``I couldn't understand why he lied to me. I left him,'' she said.
   Peter told her he lied only to get away from his past. He said he
stole to pay for the birth of their newborn daughter, Kiya. He wrote
poems from jail to win her forgiveness:
   ``Now that Kiya binds our love there is no yesterday;
   ``Just tomorrow, just for us, our love will show the way.''
   A few months later, Peter escaped from a holding cell by knocking
out another man who was to go before a judge on a minor charge.
Peter took his place, pleaded guilty to the other man's infraction,
and walked free.
   He fled to Rhode Island. Against the advice of family and
friends, Debra quit her waitressing job in Brooksville to join him
after a one-year separation.
   ``I was raising four kids and they missed him,'' she said. ``He
said I was his life and after calling me all the time, I believed
him.''
   In Rhode Island, she wondered why his beeper, supposedly for his
job at an auto body shop, went off at all hours with strange
messages. She asked enough to learn he was ``involved'' with drugs,
but didn't pry.
   ``I didn't want to know, to be honest,'' said Debra, now 30.
   Peter's drug use became so bad he asked her to wake him by
injecting him with cocaine. She refused, but stayed at his side _
telling herself he just needed help.
   When police stormed her Providence home in early 1985, Debra
learned about the murders _ all involving drug users or traffickers.
   ``I tried to imagine him doing something like that,'' she said.
``I couldn't, no matter how hard I tried.''
   Authorities offered Peter an unusual deal in exchange for his
testimony. He would serve his 10-year sentence in Providence police
custody, then be relocated. The dream of starting over helped keep
Debra with her husband. So did Peter's tales of threats against the
family, and prosecutors' pleas he was a more believable witness with
his wife by his side.
   She sent her three older children to her mother in Florida and
she and 2-year-old Kiya were allowed to join Peter in the police
station.
   The three lived together in a cell for a few weeks while a former
matrons' quarters was converted into a three-room air-conditioned
apartment. It had a telephone, television, videocassette recorder
and queen-sized water bed. But it was adjacent to the women's cells,
and the noise and screaming were incessant.
   ``It was definitely our home,'' said Debra. ``But it was like
jail, too. ... I think I always felt like I was breathing germs.''
   Peter passed the time watching TV, sharing a beer with his
guards, fishing with the mayor's chauffeur. He started an
autobiography. He was allowed out, and sometimes stayed away
overnight.
   Debra was immobilied by fear. Afraid to go out, she spent more
time in jail than Peter. She began to fear the food might be
poisoned and made her daughter wait while she tasted some first. The
strain finally proved too much and she moved back to Florida.
   ``I couldn't take it anymore: the women screaming, the officers.
My daughter was not going to be raised in that kind of
environment,'' she said.
   Two years later, in 1988, she went back to Peter at a rural Rhode
Island safe house prosecutors provided. Debra said she told police
that Peter was using cocaine and packaging drugs in the cellar, but
was told to keep quiet. A departmental review supports her
allegation.
   ``It can reasonably be inferred that Gilbert supplemented his
state income with his profits from narcotics sales,'' the review
said.
   She stayed just seven weeks. Two months later, Peter, who had a
history of heart trouble, died of a heart attack following a fight
at a Connecticut gas station, according to a medical examiner's
report.
   Debra continues to wrestle with her husband's lies. Peter told
the children he lived in the police station because he was an
undercover officer. She hasn't yet found a way to tell them the
truth.
   But she is hopeful about the future. She recently remarried and
insists, this time, she is less naive.
   ``I have started a new life with a very good man,'' she said.
``It's just a good feeling.''

   A boxy apartment-office building on
concrete stilts surmounts ruins of the 2,000-year-old Roman Temple
of Jupiter, dramatizing the clash of old and new in this teeming,
ancient city.
   A modern, marble-clad temple of commerce with jewelry shops and
clothing boutiques is next door, opposite the ancient Islamic
Medressah, or School of Nur ed-Din.
   ``It's a bad integration of the old and the new,'' said Nazih
Kawakibi, a professor of architecture at Damascus University who
serves on several restoration committees. ``They could have done it
much better.''
   Like many cities in the Middle East, Damascus is bulging at the
seams, trying to provide housing and services to a population
estimated at 2 million.
   Damascus is considered one of the world's oldest continuously
inhabited cities. The Arameans, nomads from the Arabian peninsula,
settled here in 1200 B.C., eventually building a city that became an
important commercial center.
   Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs and Ottomans have occupied
Damascus. A treasure trove of monuments reflect the cultural tides
that have swept over the city.
   Some ancient sites, like the famed Ummayyad Mosque, were
venerated by all the occupiers.
   The mosque site originally was a temple to Haddad, the Aramean
god of thunder and lightning.
   It later became the Roman Temple of Jupiter. The Byzantines built
a cathedral there, but the Arabs transformed it into the mosque,
named for the Islamic dynasty.
   Only limited resources are available to preserve the the ancient
sites.
   Kawakibi pointed to the Medressah, just on the edge of a
straight, European-style avenue cut through the city by French
colonizers in the 1930s.
   ``They stopped here; they didn't go further, thanks be to God,''
said the architect, who has devoted his life to preserving Old
Damascus.
   A 14th century tomb of the Mamelukes has been rented to a cloth
merchant, who destroyed the original lintel and cut a door through
an ancient wall to allow access to his shop.
   ``Unless we propose a solution to blend those monuments with the
commercial life of the Old City of Damascus, this is the way it all
will go,'' Kawakibi said.
   ``These buildings shouldn't function as commercial buildings, but
as museums or cultural centers. They're all registered as historical
monuments, but the law hasn't been able to prevent them from being
transgressed.''
   In one old mosque, the antique wooden minbar, or preacher's
stand, was ripped out and left in the entrance, to be replaced by a
concrete one.
   An architectural gem, the 11th century Nur ed-Din hospital, is
sandwiched between a modern shop selling shwarma, thinly sliced meat
wrapped in Arabic bread, and a jewelry store. It was restored in the
late 1970s.
   ``Parasitic buildings accumulated around it, but they're now just
part of the ambience,'' said Kawakibi, who was instrumental in the
renovation.
   Only one of the original stone-lattice windows, carved in
intricate geometric designs, had survived. Master craftsment copied
it faithfully.
   A few painted Koranic inscriptions remained on the domed
ceilings. Instead of repainting them, restorers gently penciled in
missing portions of the holy book's text.
   In a display case are ancient herbal medicines, including one
called ``aphrodisiac radish, diuretic, activates the functions of
the genital glands.''
   The hospital and dozens of other old buildings are tranquil
havens in a bustling, noisy city, as are the 11th century baths,
reached through a small door in the midst of the bazaar.
   The baths saw hard times, even becoming a soap factory at one
point.
   Now, men swaddled in towels sip at glasses of boiling-hot tea
after a searing bath and massage. They read their newspapers beneath
a dome painted with complicated flowery designs.
   Renovation is not always popular.
   ``When you're trying to renovate these buildings, there's a lot
of protest because they don't understand what is meant by
renovation,'' Kawakibi said. ``They think you mean destroying the
old buildings and putting up new ones.''
   At the Masjid al-Madrassah al-Umariyah mosque and school complex,
which dates from the time of the First Crusade in the 11th century,
dozens of squatters who built concrete huts on the grounds are being
evicted.
   In deciding how to proceed, restorers rely on old drawings, their
knowledge of the architectural practices of the time, and sometimes
photographs from the 19th and early 20th centuries.
   In the 1960s, the government and experts drew up a master plan
for the city, which included providing modern services and
preserving the old city. It has become hopelessly outdated.
   Even a devoted restorationist like Kawakibi acknowledges that
``attention should be paid to modern problems more than old ones. We
need infrastructure, telephones, transportation.''

<HEAD>Pro-Apartheid Candidate Makes Strong Bid In Special Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pro-apartheid candidate has
made a surprisingly strong showing in a special parliamentary
election widely seen as a referendum on President F.W. de Klerk's
reforms.
   In Wednesday's vote, held to fill a vacant seat in Parliament
from a working-class district in Durban, ruling party candidate Piet
Matthee defeated Francis Hitchcock of the pro-apartheid Conservative
Party.
   But the margin of victory _ 5,762 to 5,215 _ was far smaller than
in last September's white election, when the candidate of the ruling
National Party outpolled the Conservative candidate, 6,149 to 2,429.
   The Conservatives said their performance improved because a
growing number of whites are upset with de Klerk's plans to
dismantle apartheid and negotiate a new constitution with black
opposition groups.
   De Klerk has launched a series of reforms since assuming power in
August. He says he wants the country's 5 million whites to share
power with the 28 million blacks, who currently have no voice in
national affairs.
   The Conservatives oppose all concessions to blacks and want South
Africa divided into several separate states along racial lines.
   They are the official opposition in the dominant white chamber of
Parliament, with 39 seats. The National Party has 93 seats in the
white chamber and the anti-apartheid Democratic Party has 33.
   The tri-cameral Parliament also has houses for Asians and people
of mixed-race. Blacks vote only in local elections in segregated
townships.
   In September's nationwide white elections, the National Party won
48 percent, the Conservatives 31 percent and the Democrats 21
percent.
   Wednesday's election filled the seat vacated by the National
Party's Con Botha, who has been named the administrator of Natal
Province.

<HEAD>Pro-Choice Republicans Chalking Up Victories in States</HEAD>

   Pro-choice Republicans won a trio of platform
victories at recent state party conventions and expect still more
states to part ways with the national GOP's anti-abortion plank this
year.
   Republicans in Maine and New York have adopted pro-choice state
platform provisions, and Wisconsin Republicans voted down an
anti-abortion plank that would have called for legal protection
``for all human beings, from conception on.''
   With the convention season just beginning, more state parties
will be taking up platform language or resolutions in coming weeks
that depart from the national GOP's platform opposition to abortion.
   The actions have the indirect blessing of national Republicans,
as they test Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater's assertion
that the party is a ``big tent'' with room for differing views on
abortion.
   ``The Atwater theory is alive _ those views are being
accommodated,'' said Leslie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Republican
National Committee.
   ``We, of course, are not involved at the state level in what
their platforms look like, but there's no question that abortion is
now an issue that's being handled at the state level,'' she said.
   Colorado Republicans, who meet this Saturday, are scheduled to
face a series of proposed resolutions on abortion, and leaders there
expect some moderately pro-choice language to prevail.
Abortion-rights advocates say they expect pro-choice resolutions
also will be offered at upcoming conventions in New Jersey and other
states.
   ``These are very significant shifts in the party, I think,'' said
Mary Dent Crisp, head of the National Republican Coalition for
Choice, one of three national organizations of Republicans who back
abortion rights.
   ``The big-tent theory was permission for the pro-choice position
and anti-choice position to be side-by-side within the Republican
Party,'' said Crisp, who was RNC co-chairwoman in the late 1970s.
   Ann Stone, a conservative activist who heads the group
Republicans for Choice, said the state actions demonstrate ``the
current party platform is not consistent with the basic philosophy''
of Republicans on abortion.
   In the latest action, Wisconsin Republicans voted down the
proposed anti-abortion plank at their state convention last Saturday
in Milwaukee.
   Both sides claimed victory, however, because after rebuffing the
anti-abortion provision the delegates approved separate resolutions
opposing abortion as a method of birth control or for the mother's
convenience.
   GOP Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, who is seeking re-election, said he
took no part in the platform debate, although he opposes abortion in
most cases.
   ``Pro-choice Republicans won the day,'' Crisp said, claiming a
victory in Wisconsin.
   New York Republicans last week approved an abortion-rights plank
without debate. It says ``state government must not become a `big
brother,' regulating people in their personal affairs and lives.''
Although the measure was opposed by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.,
the convention's keynote speaker, it was approved without debate.
   In Maine, where Republican Gov. John R. McKernan Jr. and other
top elected Republicans support abortion rights, delegates to the
state convention in late April rejected an anti-abortion amendment
to the state platform.
   They approved platform language saying, ``We prefer to trust the
personal integrity of the people of the state in making this very
private decision rather than having it become a divisive political
issue.''
   Darla St. Martin, associate executive director of the National
Right to Life Committee, claimed victory in the Wisconsin
resolutions and said the New York action will backfire on GOP
candidates.
   ``This is very bad for the Republican Party in New York because
that's not what's going on elsewhere,'' St. Martin said.
   Stone's group is striving to have the 1992 GOP national
convention adopt new platform language supporting abortion rights,
or at least drop its current anti-abortion plank.
   The platform adopted at the 1988 Republican National Convention
said ``the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life
which cannot be infringed'' and called for a constitutional
amendment banning abortion.
   Since then, a Supreme Court ruling gave states far greater leeway
to place restrictions on abortion and intensified political debate
over the issue.
   Republicans lost races for governor of Virginia and New Jersey in
1989, when their candidates were attacked for anti-abortion views.
Both sides of the abortion debate have claimed successes in
primaries so far this year, including in Iowa on Tuesday when
Democrats nominated an abortion-rights advocate for governor.

   Commercial bankers beset with souring real
estate loans are seeking the same type of regulatory leniency that
analysts say pushed savings and loan institutions deeper in trouble.
   Meeting in private at a Washington hotel, chief executives of
some of the nation's largest banks asked the Federal Reserve Board
to bend capital standards while they work off losses from sour real
estate loans, according to minutes of the session obtained by The
Associated Press.
   The 12-member Federal Advisory Council, created by law to advise
the central bank, suggested at the May 3 meeting that regulators
permit banks to deduct real estate loan losses from their earnings
over a period of years rather than all at once.
   It also asked for relaxed capital rules to permit banks to hold
and manage repossessed real estate rather than have to sell it into
a depressed market.
   ``It would be constructive to include a more flexible approach to
problem real estate assets,'' the minutes said.
   Analysts denounced the suggestion, pointing out that forbearance
by S&amp;L regulators allowed those institutions to disguise their true
condition and run up their losses.
   ``It's deja vu all over again,'' said Robert Litan of the
Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. ``This was the story
of the 1980s and the thrift crisis.''
   Bert Ely, a financial institutions consultant in Alexandria, Va.,
said forbearance toward agricultural lenders during the farm crisis
of the early 1980s worked out but was a gamble.
   ``Every time you do it, you're taking a risk with the taxpayers'
money. The problem is if it isn't done well, we end up in another
S&amp;L mess,'' Ely said.
   Spreading out losses over a period of years improves the
appearance of a bank's balance sheet, Ely said. ``But the thing is
the losses are there and the earning power of the bank is impaired
as a result. ... Ultimately it's a charade.''
   Litan said extended loss write-offs allow banks to continue to
pay dividends to stockholders. But he added, ``Personally I don't
think that's prudent. When capital weakens, they should husband
every dollar of earnings they have and plow it back into the bank.'''
   The Federal Reserve keeps the minutes of the council's sessions
secret for three years, but the AP obtained a copy after the
discussion was disclosed in Wednesday editions of USA Today. Federal
Reserve spokesmen were reported out of their office Wednesday and
unavailable to respond to questions.
   In a related development Wednesday, federal regulators assured
members of Congress that a government crackdown on bank lending is
not the cause of a credit squeeze in some regions.
   The officials, appearing before the House Small Business
Committee, conceded that some banks are making it more difficult for
businesses to get loans, particularly for commercial real estate
projects.
   But they said that is more a response to a sluggish economy than
a reaction to intensified scrutiny from government examiners. They
said they have cautioned their examiners not to be overzealous in
scrutinizing loans.
   In general, however, the regulators stood firm in the face of
complaints by lawmakers that credit-worthy constituents were having
trouble getting loans.
   ``A slowdown in certain markets seems entirely warranted given
current economic conditions,'' said Federal Reserve Board member
John P. LaWare.
   ``In my view, banks should be applauded for tightening lending
standards,'' said Paul G. Fritts, director of supervision for the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   He said regulators' critics are confusing a normal credit
contraction during a time of economic downturn with a credit crunch
in which legitimate projects cannot attract financing.
   However, Rep. Richard E. Neal, D-Mass., whose state has been
among the hardest hit by a slump in real estate, said, ``Regardless
of what's been stated today, a perception has been created that a
curtain has been dropped over some of the entrepreneurship that
we've witnessed in New England over the last decade.''
   Del. Walter Fauntroy, D-D.C., complained about scarcity of
business loans in the nation's capital.
   ``Some banks throttled their lending down so sharply that some
members of the (House) Banking Committee began to fear a
full-fledged credit crunch,'' he said.

   Two of Jerome Robbins' finest ballets and another
that audiences love made up the delightful, varied program on the
second night of the New York City Ballet's June 5 - 17 ``Festival of
Jerome Robbins' Ballets.''
   ``Dances at a Gathering,'' performed Wednesday at the New York
State Theater, has been highly acclaimed by critics and an audience
favorite since the company premiered it in 1969. To about an hour of
Chopin played by pianist Jerry Zimmerman, 10 dancers take solos,
duets, trios and multiple trios.
   The ballet flows from one scene to another. It's plotless but
relationships can be read into it. The mood of much of it is
friendly but there are also duets of gentle rapture.
   Among the 10 dancers we were most struck by Darci Kistler, who
enlivened scenes she appeared in, and Jock Soto, who has real stage
presence.
   Robbins has dedicated this ballet to the memory of dance and
Broadway lighting designer Jean Rosenthal.
   Lighting is important to Robbins and lighting in ``Dances at a
Gathering'' and ``Glass Pieces'' was superb.
   The 20-minute ``Glass Pieces,'' which Robbins choreographed in
1983 to music by Philip Glass, is a sophisticated gem, one of the
most successful modern ballets.
   The back wall looks like a big piece of graph paper. Forty-three
dancers move in intricate, purposeful, precise formations. It looks
like Wall Street at lunch hour.
   In the second of three pieces of music, Maria Calegari and Adam
Luders dance a duet, center stage, with a spotlight on them. A line
of dancers across the back of the stage, in dim blue light, moves in
repeated, unison figures. We couldn't take our eyes off that linear
movement, as it echoed the hypnotic repeated short phrases of music.
   The evening began with the brief ``Circus Polka.'' Igor
Stravinsky composed the music in 1942 at George Balanchine's
instigation, for the Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey Circus.
   Robbins choreographed it for the New York City Ballet's
Stravinsky Festival in 1972, with 54 baby ballerinas from the School
of American Ballet. He was Ringmaster, snapping a whip to send rows

<HEAD>Investigators Find Problems in Job Training Programs</HEAD>

   The $2.6 million spent by a Toyota auto plant
in Kentucky to train 545 workers who did not qualify as needy is
just one of many questionable expenses within federal job training
programs, Labor Department investigators say.
   Many of the workers at the Scott County, Ky., plant were working
fulltime and therefore ineligible for the Job Training Partnership
Act program, the department's inspector general's office said in
documents submitted to Congress on Wednesday.
   But Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, testifying before the
documents were addressed, said the $3 billion-a-year program has
been ``remarkably free'' of fraud and abuse.
   Loopholes in federal law resulted in such examples as officials
in Portage, Wis., spending $22,000 of federal job training money on
dinner cruises and Christmas parties, Mrs. Dole told the House
Education and Labor Committee.
   In that case, officials put job-training advance funds in the
bank and then spent the interest, she said. The Senate has already
passed a measure to clarify that interest earned on federal job
training funds must be spent on job training, she said.
   Other questionable expenses outlined by the inspector general's
office included:
   _$718,768 spent by the Houston Job Training Partnership Council
for enrolling and training security guards at a cost of $3,000 each.
The contractor billed for nearly 400 hours of training for each
participant, even though Texas only requires 26 hours of training
for registration as an armed security guard, auditors said.
   _$33,801 paid to a subcontractor in Michigan for placing college
students in jobs they had found themselves, or with employers for
whom they had previously worked or in jobs in which the employers
would have hired them without federal assistance.
   _$640,000 spent in Louisiana to install a high-tech training
center at Northwestern State University. Purchases included
television cameras, satellite disks and computers. No dislocated
workers were served, the auditors found.
   _$90,155 for inflated placement claims at the Full Employment
Council of Kansas City, Mo. Another $90,000 was questioned because
employers could not or would not provide payroll records to support
on-the-job-training claims.
   Mrs. Dole said that of the thousands of private businessmen who
have helped administer JTPA funds, there have been only 24
allegations of conflicts of interest.
   ``We believe this is an impressive record,'' she said.
   The overall operation of the program has been ``remarkably free
of instances of fraud, abuse or other wrongdoing,'' the labor
secretary said. However, she said misuse of funds was ``inevitable''
in a program as large as JTPA, which has received $21 billion since
it was created seven years ago.
   Mrs. Dole, who supports tougher record-keeping requirements, also
called on Congress to tighten eligibility requirements so the
neediest cases would benefit from the program.
   She said she backed narrowing the requirements so the program
would be more focused on people who lacked basic skills, those who
are high school dropouts or those with disabilities.
   ``We must target ... the tougher cases, the ones who are not
going to make it without our intervention,'' Mrs. Dole said.

   There are no plans for Jane Pauley to co-anchor
the ``NBC Nightly News'' with Tom Brokaw, NBC News president Michael
Gartner says. But he's not ruling out the possibility.
   ``He specifically said, `We never say never,''' network
spokeswoman Betty Hudson told reporters in a briefing on Gartner's
closed-door presentation at the NBC affiliates' convention Wednesday.
   NBC Television president Pier Mapes emphasized that Pauley's
first priority is a series of prime-time specials. She also will do
special reports for ``Nightly'' and fill in for Brokaw.
   Pauley left NBC's troubled ``Today'' show in December after the
network brought in Deborah Norville.
   In an interview in July's issue of Ladies' Home Journal, Pauley
insisted NBC was not trying to force her out. But she said her
husband, ``Doonesbury'' cartoonist Garry Trudeau, was skeptical.
   ``His initial reaction to NBC's handling of the whole thing was
`slash and burn,''' Pauley said in an interview ``I remember him
telling someone that most people in my position would have left tire
tracks on Deborah's back.''
   But Pauley said she admires the way Norville has handled the
controversy.
   ``If it had been me getting all that criticism, I would not have
been functioning professionally,'' she said. ``I probably wouldn't
have wanted to show my face.''

   Cable TV mogul Ted Turner has promised to
apologize for calling Christianity ``a religion for losers'' when he
speaks at a church luncheon next week, the church pastor says.
   ``He made the statement he wants a chance to apologize to the
world, but would say other things we might not like,'' said the Rev.
Johnny Hunt of the 3,500-member First Baptist Church of Woodstock.
   Hunt said Turner initiated the idea for the June 13 luncheon at
the suburban Atlanta church, where a former girlfriend and a fishing
buddy are members.
   Turner criticized Christians last year and again last month at
the National Convention of the American Humanist Association when he
was named Humanist of the Year.
   Hunt speculated that maybe Turner ``hasn't met the right ones.''

   James Michener wrote a plea to three
young men who pleaded guilty to anti-Semitic vandalism: ``Get off
that doomed train right now.''
   A judge had given the men an unusual sentence: learn about the
Nazi Holocaust. Part of the assignment was to read a chapter from
the author's book ``Poland'' on a concentration camp.
   After learning of the sentence, Michener wrote to the men through
the judge, John Carey, who said Wednesday he was moved by the
author's interest.
   ``Fellows, what you're doing is wrong,'' Michener wrote. ``You
will stain yourselves if you follow that route. Get off that doomed
train right now.''
   Michael Morano, 18, Michael Venturino, 18, and Neville Anthony
Mason, 20, pleaded guilty to defacing a high school a year ago.
   Michener's books include ``Chesapeake,'' ``The Drifters'' and the
Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Tales of the South Pacific.''

of one.
   ``I visualize in my mind, I learned this from my idols of years
ago, that there's only one person listening or watching and you
direct yourself to that person,'' Clark said in an interview.
   ``It's a secret that Arthur Godfrey knew very well, Garry Moore

   Georgia Rae Keithley is
following in the footsteps of her father, punk-rock singer Joey
Keithley _ but into the movies, not the music scene.
   The 8-month-old has been chosen from hundreds of candidates as
one of the two tots who will play Julie in ``Look Who's Talking
Too,'' which starts shooting next week in Vancouver.
   Her father, lead singer of the band DOA, made his movie debut
earlier this year as thuggish Officer Friendly in ``Terminal City
Ricochet.'' He has also appeared in television's ``Secret Lives''
and ``Wiseguy.''
   ``Look Who's Talking Too'' is a sequel to the hit ``Look Who's

   From 3.8 billion miles, the Earth is a blue dot
in an ocean of black.
   ``On that blue dot, that's where everyone you know, everyone you
ever heard of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their
life,'' astronomer Carl Sagan said Wednesday as NASA released an
extraordinary photo taken from a vantage point in deep space.
   Voyager 1, speeding toward the edge of the solar system, looked
back in February and snapped photos of six of the nine planets that
whirl around the sun.
   The photograph, actually a mosaic of 64 images taken in a
four-hour period, was the last from the spacecraft. The pictures
were recorded Feb. 13-14 but were not played back to Earth until
late March because deep-space radio receivers were occupied with
higher priority tasks.
   The camera looked down from 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane _
the track in which most of the planets orbit the sun. It captured
Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Earth and Venus.
   Mars was washed out by the sun, Mercury was too close to the sun
to be photographed and Pluto was too far away and too small to
appear. By happenstance, Earth was within a band of sunlight but
Sagan said it had no special significance.
   The twin spacecraft, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, were launched in
August and September 1977 from Cape Canaveral, Fla. Between them,
they explored all the giant outer planets of the solar system, 48 of
their moons and the systems of rings and magnetic fields of those
planets.
   Edward Stone of the California Institute of Technology, chief
scientist on the Voyager project, said he expected the Voyagers to
leave the solar system and cruise into interstellar space sometime
between the years 2000 and 2010. Voyager 1 is heading outward at a
rate of nearly a million miles a day.
   Sagan was asked what had been learned from the Voyagers that
would change descriptions of the solar system published in
encyclopedias in 1975.
   ``I would say you would simply tear them up,'' he replied. The
knowledge gained from the space probes ``have wholly changed our
knowledge of the solar system.''
   Stone said the greatest discovery was that Io, a moon circling
Jupiter, had active volcanoes _ the first such discovery on another
body in the solar system. The Voyagers together observed nine
volcanic eruptions on Io.
   He showed reporters time-lapse pictures that showed graphically
that other storms meld into Jupiter's Great Red Spot, and that
storms circle the planet moving in opposite directions.
   Voyager showed that Uranus, a planet tipped on its side, also has
a previously undiscovered magnetic field that is tilted 60 degrees
from the planet's axis of rotation.
   Sagan recalled that the first successful planetary mission
occurred when Mariner 2 flew past Venus in 1962.
   ``In 27 years the human species has flown close by or landed on
every planet in the solar system except Pluto,'' he said. Still,
``we have no evidence, not a smidgen of evidence, suggesting life
anywhere else.''

<HEAD>Gentle Revolution Spawns Less Gentle Election Fight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The gentle revolution that
overturned Communist rule in Czechoslovakia has given way to fierce
and devious campaigning for Friday's elections, the country's first
free vote in 44 years.
   Rising nationalism in Slovakia and the shadow cast by the
Communist past have combined to revive the passion and wit that
characterized last fall`s revolt. Election posters are everywhere on
city streets.
   But the gentle camaraderie of that time is less evident, replaced
by intrigue and infighting as politicians and parties battle for
votes and power.
   The Civic Forum movement founded by President Vaclav Havel, and
its Slovak partner in the revolution, Public Against Violence, seem
certain to emerge as the strongest force nationwide.
   But the broad-based movements that have dominated government
since the revolution could fall short of an absolute majority and be
forced to share power in a new coalition.
   The latest pre-election polls gave Civic Forum and the Public
Against Violence 39 to 42 percent of the vote nationwide. Their
strongest rival, the Christian Democrats, showed a distant second
with 13 to 15 percent, although stronger _ about 25 percent _ in
Slovakia, the more rural of Czechoslovakia`s two republics.
   The Christian Democrats' chances were dealt a further blow
Wednesday, an unprecedented public denunciation of one of their top
candidates by the deputy interior minister investigating the now
disbanded Communist secret police.
   Josef Bartoncik, chairman of one of the three parties in the
Christian Democrat coalition, repeatedly has been accused of being a
secret police informer, a charge he denies.
   But deputy interior minister Jan Ruml said on national television
that he had unspecified damaging information on Bartoncik, whom he
accused of breaking a pledge to quit national politics.
   The Communists, who are third in the opinion polls, seem likely
to suffer from Wednesday's well-publicized roundup of at least seven
former party leaders widely blamed for the 21 years of repressive
Communist rule after the 1968 invasion that crushed the ``Prague
Spring'' reforms.
   The roundup appeared well timed by Civic Forum to remind voters
of the horrors of Communist rule and reap the benefit when polls
open Friday at 2 p.m. Some 11.1 million people are entitled to cast
ballots for a new 200-seat, bicameral federal parliament and the two
regional parliaments in the Czech and Slovak republics. Voting will
continue until 11 p.m. Friday, resume early Saturday and end at 2
p.m. that day, with the first predictions expected Saturday
afternoon and final results Sunday.
   Any of the 22 parties contesting the elections will have to get
at least 5 percent of the vote to have a chance of winning seats,
which will be allotted in proportion to the total vote received in
the country's 12 electoral districts.
   Havel, who by tradition is supposed to be non-partisan as
president, has openly campaigned for Civic Forum and its Slovak
allies, drawing fire from Christian Democrats in Slovakia who say he
has exploited his authority, huge popularity and media coverage to
give an unfair advantage to his friends.
   In a nationally televised speech Tuesday, the
playwright-turned-politician appealed to Czechoslovaks to vote for
former dissidents like himself who proved their opposition to
Communism in years of lonely political struggle.
   The current government includes some reformed or former
Communists whose presence is strongly criticized by the Christian
Democrats, who hope to emulate the election success of center-right
parties in East Germany and Hungary.
   Both the Civic Forum and the Christian Democrats have ruled out a
coalition with the Communists, who are predicted to get about 10
percent of the vote. That expected 10 percent is a reflection of the
traditional strength of socialism in Czechoslovakia, and the
reluctance of some to embark on the tough road to a market economy.
   Making that change and dealing with growing separatist tendencies
in Slovakia will be the chief problems facing any new government
   Havel is virtually certain to be confirmed as president by the
new Parliament, whose chief task in its two-year term is to remake
Czechoslovakia's constitution.
   That will confront deputies with the Slovaks' demands for a
loose, federal alliance to replace the current federation of Czech
and Slovak republics created by the Communists in 1968.
   Eventually, many Slovaks would like to see a separate Slovak
state in a united Europe.

<HEAD>Democrats Say Halt to Pesticide Exports Would Aid U.S. Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats on the Senate Agriculture Committee
say legislation to halt export of pesticides that can't be sold in
the United States will help American farmers.
   ``By stopping the export of banned and unregistered pesticides,
we will level the playing field for our producers,'' said Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the committee. ``Both domestic and
foreign farmers will be treated the same.''
   The committee inserted the ban Wednesday in its version of the
1990 farm bill, under protest from ranking Republican Sen. Richard
Lugar of Indiana and other GOP members on the committee.
   Lugar said he didn't think the provision belonged in the
legislation that establishes the government's agricultural policy
for the next five years.
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., said the legislation could lead to
loss of jobs at chemical companies that may decide to do their
manufacturing abroad.
   He also said, ``If we phase companies out, it would take other
companies very little time to gear up.''
   Jay Vroom, president of the National Agricultural Chemicals
Association, said his organization would continue to try to get the
committee to change certain provisions of the bill.
   He said proposed restrictions on experimentation with chemicals
would be detrimental to U.S. scientific discovery.
   ``We could be shooting ourselves in the foot,'' Vroom said.
``Some companies will move research plants to Europe where the
likelihood is better of moving products around the world unfettered
during experimentation on crops.''
   He said many of the unregistered chemicals sold abroad that would
be banned from export are awaiting approval by the Environmental
Protection Agency, which has a backlog. Thus, they could eventually
be registered here, he said.
   Other chemicals don't pass the zero tolerance laws in the United
States for residue, but do pass pesticide regulations in other
countries, Vroom said.
   Leahy said that no part of the farm bill generated more mail to
his office than this one.
   ``At a time when we are toughening our standards at home, we need
to do more about imports with hazardous pesticides,'' he said.
``Because the Food and Drug Administration waives through virtually
all imported food without inspection, these chemicals often end up
on America's dinner tables.''
   About 25 percent of the fruits and vegetables consumed in the
United States come from abroad.
   Many of the chemicals that have been banned for health reasons
were quite effective in eliminating pests and increasing crop yields.
   ``Foreign farmers are able to use made-in-the-USA chemicals that
our farmers cannot,'' said Leahy. ``We effectively penalize U.S.
farmers and growers for using safe pesticides and obeying the law.''

   U.S. food processors and processing-equipment
makers took a few steps closer to converting the Soviet Union to the
capitalistic system during a conference this week.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher signed an agreement Wednesday
with the Soviet Union that promises that federal officials will work
with the Soviets to find ways to adapt the U.S. food making and
distribution system to their country.
   Vladilen Nikitin, the Soviet equivalent to the U.S. agriculture
secretary, said the agreement was a small step, ``but everything
starts with a small step.''
   ``For you, it's a key if you want to participate in the
strengthening of our economy,'' he said through an interpreter.
   The pact was signed on the last day of a three-day conference
sponsored by the Food Processing Machinery &amp; Supplies Association
and the National Food Processors Association.
   Mosbacher said the pact was unprecedented and a start toward
expanding trade between the two superpowers.
   ``We are the two largest industrialized nations in the world,''
said Mosbacher. ``We have one-third of the world's GNP (gross
national product). But we do only a tiny fraction of world trade.''
   John Cady, president of the food processors association, said
barriers are beginning to come down, although Americans are
concerned about getting paid for business with the Soviets.
   Soviet currency is of almost no value in the world market,
leaving those companies doing business in the Soviet Union to either
accept products in exchange or wait for long-term gains after the
economy there improves.
   ``We have to understand when companies invest, it's not going to
be a three-year turnaround, but probably eight to 10 years,'' said
Cady.
   He said Nikitin was a powerful official in the Soviet government
and would smooth the way for American business.
   U.S. businessmen at the conference had complained earlier of
complications in dealing with the Soviet bureaucracy.

   Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., wants to put his
agricultural marketing reform legislation into the 1990 farm bill.
   The measure would modify the Agriculture Department's grading
standards of fruit and vegetables by including flavor, sugar content
and nutritional value as grading criteria.
   The current system of some produce relies solely on its exterior
appearance with no regard for the quality of the fruit or vegetable,
Fowler said.
   Sometimes pesticides are used to enhance the looks of produce
when external appearance is irrelevant, such as in fruits or
vegetables used by juice makers.
   ``Both consumers and farmers will benefit from this amendment,''
Fowler said Wednesday. ``Consumers will be eating healthier food
with less pesticides and farmers will be reducing their costs by
spending less money on pesticides.''

<HEAD>1.3 Billion Pounds of Chemicals Linked to Birth Defects Released</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial plants released more than 1.3
billion pounds of chemicals suspected or known to be linked to birth
defects in 1988, with the largest amount coming from the
petrochemical belt of Texas, an environmental group said today.
   Citizen Action said it analyzed computerized data from the
Environmental Protection Agency to determine what regions of the
country had the most hazardous chemical pollution.
   Industrial facilities emitted more than 4.6 billion pounds of
hazardous chemicals into the air, water and onto the ground in 1988,
about half of it into the air, according to EPA figures released
earlier this year.
   The analysis by Citizen Action, based on the same EPA statistics,
showed that nearly one-third of the chemicals released _ about 1.3
billion pounds _ have either been shown to cause birth defects or
are strongly suspected to have such a link. Most of these releases
were into the air.
   The EPA has cautioned against using the raw data to determine
health risks because the statistics doe not take into account such
factors as dosage and actual exposure. The data, which is required
to be submitted by industry, reflects the amount released from a
factory over a year's period.
   A large percentage of the releases cited by Citizen Action
involved industrial solvents such as tuluene and xylene, which
medical experts say could pose health problems if a person is
chronically exposed or exposed to large amounts.
   According to Citizen Action, about 17 percent of the total
releases linked to birth defects come from 10 companies, many of
which have factories in various parts of the country.
   The 3M Corp., which has been touted by the Bush administration
for having innovative pollution-control measures, ranked as the
company with the most releases of chemicals linked to birth defects.
   Total releases for the company were put at nearly 53 million
pounds, with a 3M plant in Hutchinson, Minn., reporting releases of
16 million pounds, mainly industrial solvents.
   General Motors Corp. ranked second, releasing nearly 41 million
pounds from plants around the country. It was followed by Avtex
Fibers Inc., Front Royal, Va., with 34 million pounds. The Avtex
plant closed last year after a lengthy dispute over pollution with
Virginia state officials.
   Rick Renner, a spokesman for 3M in Minneapolis, said the company
has a program under way aimed at cutting toxic emissions by 90
percent by the end of the decade and that new emission control
equipment is being installed at the Hutchinson plant. ``Our
emissions will be down substantially this year,'' he said.
   After Texas, the states in 1988 with the most releases of
chemicals shown or suspected to cause birth defects were Ohio,
Indiana, Illinois, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Tennessee,
California and New York. With the Avtex plant closed, Virginia no
longer would be among these states.
   The 10 counties in 1988 with the highest releases of chemicals
linked to birth defects were: Warren, (the Virginia location of the
now closed Avtex plant); Los Angeles (California); Cook (Illinois);
Harris (Texas); Hamblen (Tennessee); McLeod (Minnesota); Wayne
(Michigan); Jefferson (Louisiana); Middlesex (New Jersey); and
Jefferson (Texas).
   Citizen Action is a Washington-based federation of consumer and
environmental groups in 27 states and claim more than 2 million
members.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Seeks Repeal of Newspaper Preservation Act</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 1970 law that allows competing newspapers to
merge their business operations is fattening publishers' wallets but
eroding press freedom and the quality of the nation's journalism, a
Republican congressman says.
   ``It seems ironic that some of the very voices which call for
free market forces to work in other industries seek government
protection for creating monopolies in their own,'' said Rep. Carl
Pursell on Michigan.
   Pursell introduced a bill Wednesday to repeal the Newspaper
Preservation Act, which allows newspapers in the same city to
operate as a single business entity while maintaining separate news
and editorial staffs.
   The bill would not affect the partial mergers already in place.
But it would prohibit similar arrangements _ known as joint
operating agreements or JOAs _ in the future.
   Leaders of Citizens for an Independent Press, a national
coalition of small newspaper publishers, business and civic leaders,
endorsed Pursell's bill. They accused the large newspapers that have
entered into JOAs of sacrificing principle for profit.
   ``These crybaby billionaires have for many years enjoyed one of
the biggest and most enduring special-interest giveaways in American
history,'' said Bruce B. Brugmann, editor and publisher of the San
Francisco Bay Guardian, a weekly newspaper.
   Pursell said he once favored the law but changed his mind after
seeing results of last year's JOA between the Detroit Free Press and
The Detroit News. He said he also was bothered by the fact that JOAs
are subject to approval by the U.S. attorney general, since they
grant exemptions to antitrust laws.
   ``Newspapers which seek JOAs are put in a compromising position
of being dependent on the federal government for their survival,''
he said. ``How can such newspapers truly fulfill their watchdog
role?''
   Newspapers in 19 cities were operating under JOAs last year.
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh approved two others _ in Las Vegas
and York, Pa. _ this year.
   Since the Detroit JOA took effect last November, the Free Press
and the News have devoted less space to news and more to
advertisements, Pursell said.
   ``I think they're losing readership,'' he said. ``As I go around
my district, most of the readers I hear feel that the newspapers
have declined in terms of news.''
   Joseph Ungaro, president and chief executive officer of the
Detroit Newspaper Agency, which administers the Detroit JOA, said
the arrangement has been successful despite some early delivery
problems and a circulation decline for The News.
   The Free Press' daily circulation was 629,275 in March 1989 and
rose to 639,767 by March 1990, Ungaro said.
   The News' circulation fell from 693,943 in March 1989 to 526,147
in March 1990, largely because of a decision to scale back
circulation outside the Detroit area and to make the News an
afternoon paper instead of retaining most of the previous morning
editions, Ungaro said.
   ``I'd have to say that the readers are voting with their
pocketbooks every day by buying the product,'' he said.
   Ungaro said the only alternative to JOAs is the loss of some of
the nation's oldest and best newspapers. Knight-Ridder, which owns
the Free Press, had indicated it would close the money-losing
newspaper if the JOA were denied.
   ``Is one paper with a monopoly better than two voices in the
community? I don't think so,'' Ungaro said.
   The Supreme Court upheld former Attorney General Edwin Meese's
approval of the Detroit JOA on a 4-4 vote last year.

<HEAD>Air Force says Soviet Radar Would See B-2 as Insect on Screen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The B-2 stealth bomber is 69 feet long, 17 feet
high and has a wingspan of 172 feet, but on a Soviet radar monitor
the aircraft would appear to be an object no bigger than an insect.
   The Air Force on Wednesday revealed the bomber's radar cross
section as it continued its campaign to bolster diminishing
congressional support for the bat-winged aircraft, priced at $815
million each.
   ``The B-2's significantly reduced radar cross section minimizes
the detectability of the B-2 to the point it can operate with
virtual impunity,'' the Air Force said in one of three detailed
reports.
   In testimony to a Senate Armed Services subcommittee, Air Force
Secretary Donald Rice and Chief of Staff Gen. Larry D. Welch
unveiled the reports to support arguments for the bomber,
manufactured by the Northrop Corp.
   An unclassified page in one report describing typical radar cross
sections compared ships, aircraft, birds and three insects _ the
blue-winged locust, the honeybee and the alfalfa caterpillar
butterfly.
   Pressed to categorize the bomber, Welch responded, ``It's in the
insect category.'' He refused to elaborate.
   The Air Force has repeatedly said the B-2 is not invisible and
there are systems that sometimes can detect the aircraft. But Welch
said the small cross section the aircraft would occupy on a radar
screen would enhance its ability to operate without detection in
Soviet air space.
   Rice assured the Senate panel that if the plane fails low
observability tests, scheduled to begin this fall, he would
reconsider the program.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, citing both a diminished Soviet
threat to the West and budget pressures, proposed on April 27
cutting the planned total B-2 purchase from 132 to 75.
   In the $303 billion defense budget for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1, Cheney cut the number of stealths to be bought from five to
two.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., chairman of the Senate subcommittee on
strategic forces and nuclear deterrence, heralded the testimony from
Welch and Rice as ``crucial to the continuation of the B-2 bomber
program.''
   The Senate panel is expected to begin crafting a fiscal 1991
defense bill later this month.
   But Exon, a B-2 supporter, immediately expressed frustration when
Rice could not provide specific information on the reduced cost of
the program in fiscal 1991 with the reduction in planned purchases.
   ``It's six weeks since the secretary himself indicated the
reduced buy,'' Exon said. ``Just not getting the information up to
us indicates to me that there must be a lot of unanswered questions
on the bottom side of that balance sheet over there.''
   Pressed by other lawmakers, Rice said the program in fiscal 1991
would cost about $4.5 billion, some $900 million less than
originally proposed. He was unable to provide specifics on military
construction costs, spare parts, advanced procurement and research
and development.
   The Air Force secretary added that the overall cost of the B-2
program would likely be slightly higher than the $61.1 billion
Cheney estimated when the planned acquisition was reduced. Rice
estimated $62 billion for a fleet of 75 planes.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department opposes congressional
proposals aimed at eliminating lengthy delays of death penalty
appeals.
   A House plan would have the reverse effect of stringing out the
appeal process, and a Senate plan has technical defects, Deputy
Assistant Attorney General Paul L. Maloney told a House panel
Wednesday.
   The Senate plan, cosponsored by Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., is designed to shorten death penalty delays
by replacing state habeas corpus proceedings with a single federal
court review.
   Habeas corpus proceedings are used by defendants who have been
sentenced to death and are trying to win new trials or sentences.
The Specter-Thurmond amendment was defeated, then passed 12 hours
later on May 24, allowing it to be added to a comprehensive Senate
anti-crime bill.
   The amendment would require federal habeas corpus petitions to be
filed within 60 days after final action by state courts.
   The amendment raises ``interesting possibilities'' for reducing
appeals delays ``through a stronger, more comprehensive system of
time limitation rules,'' Maloney told a House Judiciary subcommittee.
   But he added, ``We do find that there are some defects, some
technical problems if you will.'' Under questioning, he said the
amendment was still under review and that he was not prepared to
specify what the problems were.
   The two proposals are among several under consideration in
Congress to speed up death penalty appeals while ensuring
defendants' rights.
   The House plan, sponsored by Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis.,
would give death row inmates new appeal rights while ensuring that
their attorneys met strict experience and performance standards.
   The bill also aims to end appeals delays by restricting multiple
prisoner petitions, and establishing a one-year limit within for
inmates to file for federal habeas relief.
   But Maloney said the measure ``multiplies the opportunity for
delay and abuse'' in capital cases.
   He quoted retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, who said
recently that a vote for Kastenmeier's bill ``would in practical
effect be a vote to eliminate capital punishment in the United
States.''
   The department would recommend that President Bush veto the bill
if it passed Congress in its present form, Maloney said.
   But the bill was backed during Wednesday's hearing by civil
rights leader Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference. He said a broader supervisory role by the
federal judiciary was needed to stop the ``inexhaustible litany of
racial discrimination cases in the courts in the rural South.''

   Nashua High School seniors have compromised
with their principal on a more ``wholesome'' version of the Beatles
song they picked to sing at commencement.
   ``Everybody wins this way,'' Principal Ronald Jean said after an
hourlong sit-in by about 150 students Wednesday was resolved with
negotiations.
   ``The kids get to sing the song they want, and they also get to
have a wholesome graduation at the same time. I'm happy with this
resolution.''
   Jean vetoed the 1967 Beatles song ``With a Little Help from My
Friends,'' because of the line in the chorus, ``I get high with a
little help from my friends.''
   Jean said the reference is to drugs and alcohol, but students say
it means a spiritual high from close friendship.
   The students agreed instead to repeat the chorus' first line, ``I
get by with a little help from my friends.''

   President Bush is said to be ``very upset''
that a Secret Service agent shoved a top White House adviser as
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev left San Francisco.
   Condoleezza Rice, Bush's senior adviser on Soviet affairs and the
highest ranking black woman at the White House, was among the VIPs
at an airport reception line at Gorbachev's departure when an
unidentified Secret Service agent reportedly ordered her to stay
behind security barricades and then shoved her, even though she
identified herself as a member of the official White House party.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the agent
``pushed Conde Rice. Simple as that.''
   Speaking to a roomful of reporters, Fitzwater added, ``You've all
had it happen to you 100 times.''
   ``The president is aware of it, he's very upset about it _ most
unfortunate,'' Fitzwater said.
   There was no explanation for the incident.
   ``We have no idea what the factors were,'' Fitzwater said.
   Allan Cramer, a Secret Service spokesman, said, ``We're looking

<HEAD>Administration Opposes Move To Re-Regulate Cable TV Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration says it opposes a
Senate bill that would reimpose some local rate regulation on the
cable TV industry.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, in a letter to Sen. Ernest
F. Hollings, D-S.C., and John Danforth, R-Mo., said the
administration believes that competition, not regulation, is the
best way to benefit the public and cable TV companies.
   The letter was made public Wednesday.
   Congress in 1984 essentially lifted all regulation of the cable
TV industry, effective at the beginning of 1986. Since that time,
cable rates have risen sharply amid complaints of poor service.
   The cable industry maintains that it has gone through a period of
``growing pains'' in the wake of deregulation and that rates are
stabilizing and service is improving.
   But members of Congress, stung by constituent complaints,
increasingly have been in a mood to restore regulatory supervision.

<HEAD>Electrocution Problem Solved By Conn., Fla. Firms, CPSC Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two major manufacturers of hair dryers have
eliminated the danger of electrocution when their products fall into
water, says the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   The new hair dryers solve a problem which has plagued the
industry since the early 1980s when an estimated 17 electrocutions
annually were caused by hand-held hair dryers falling into tubs and
other water, the commission said Wednesday.
   Approximately 10 of these deaths were to children under 10 years
of age, the agency said.
   ``You've got people that are drying their hair that have just
come out of the shower who've got wet feet, hands and hair,'' said
Dick Bruno, vice president of marketing for Windmere Corp. of Miami,
the nation's largest hair dryer manufacturer.
   ``We wanted to take a position of providing the technology that
was available,'' he added.
   Windmere's new Guardian ESP hair dryers and curling iron and
brush incorporate the new safety feature. The ``Classics Protection
Plus'' hair dryer made by Conair Corp. of Stamford, Conn. also
includes the new safety feature.
   The new dryers have rectangular-shaped plugs with a reset button
at the end of the cords.
   A device called an appliance leakage current interrupter is built
into the plug. This detects any change in the electric current in
the dryer within a fraction of a second and shuts the appliance off.
   The new products offer protection against electrocution whether
their switches are in the ``on'' or ``off'' position.
   Hair dryers manufactured since Oct. 1, 1987 need only protect
against electrocution if they fall into water with the switch in the
``off'' position. The new dryers meet a new voluntary safety
standard that becomes effective Jan. 1, 1991.

   It took less than a day for a House Republican
to enlist the support of more than 80 colleagues for his drive to
have a special prosecutor appointed to investigate the savings and
loan crisis.
   ``There's a real sense around here that the public deserves some
answers,'' Rep. Peter Smith of Vermont said Wednesday in an
interview. ``This is, far and away, the worst financial scandal in
the history of this country.''
   Smith said response to his proposal from fellow legislators has
been ``very positive on a bipartisan basis,'' although a Justice
Department spokesman called the move unnecessary.
   Smith's resolution, which would have no binding legal effect,
calls on President Bush to instruct Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
to appoint a special prosecutor, known officially as an independent
counsel, ``to investigate the involvement of government officials in
the savings and loan scandal.''
   Eighty-five congressmen from both parties had signed the
resolution by late Wednesday, said Smith's press secretary, Liz
Nicolson.
   Some legislators have charged that federal thrift regulators were
lax in oversight of the industry. Five senators have themselves been
accused of improper conduct in connection with the collapse of
Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif.
   Smith first floated the idea of a special prosecutor for the S&amp;L
crisis in a brief, little-noticed speech on the floor of the House
on May 24.
   His resolution is the first public proposal for an independent
counsel to investigate the debacle, which will cost U.S. taxpayers
around $325 billion to cover losses to depositors of failed thrifts.
   If passed in its present form, the resolution wouldn't trigger
the provisions of the independent counsel law, which requires the
Justice Department to review such requests under certain conditions.
   In order to be mandatory under the law, the request for a special
prosecutor would have to come from a majority of Democrats or
Republicans on the House or Senate Judiciary committees.
   Independent counsels were called in most notably to investigate
the Iran-Contra and Watergate scandals. The most recent appointment
of a special prosecutor was to investigate allegations of fraud and
abuse at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Smith's proposal ``sounds to me like it's a little off the
mark,'' said Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett. He said
special prosecutors, who are separate from the department, normally
investigate high-ranking individuals in the executive branch who are
suspected of wrongdoing.
   In the savings and loan case, the allegations concern members of
Congress and individuals outside Washington, Tillett noted.
   ``I don't think we would have any problems prosecuting those
people,'' he said. ``We ought to be able to pursue those cases
pretty well on our own without calling in'' a special prosecutor.
   Several Democratic legislators have accused the Justice
Department of dragging its feet in prosecuting S&amp;L fraud cases.
About 200 House Democrats recently signed a letter asking Bush to
seek additional money for the department to pursue the cases.

   Vice President Dan Quayle is shrugging off an
incident in which a man shouting ``I have documents'' hurled a small
sheaf of papers at him, knocking him in the head, officials said.
   Quayle, who was getting into his limousine outside a Capitol Hill
office building Wednesday, was not hurt and the papers only grazed
him, said his press secretary, David Beckwith.
   Mwenea Sikuzote, 42, of St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, was arrested
and charged with assaulting the vice president, a felony that
carries the possibility of a $10,000 fine and up to 10 years in
prison upon conviction.
   ``The guy shouted `I have documents' and proceeded to throw
same,'' Beckwith said.
   But the papers were not enough to inflict damage. Quayle was
driven away by his Secret Service agents.
   One of the papers the man threw appeared to be a letter to
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said one
official, but the contents weren't disclosed.
   ``The vice president is fine,'' Beckwith said. ``He inquired
about what the guy's story was. He asked what his problem was but
otherwise shrugged off the incident,'' and returned to his office to
prepare for his afternoon schedule.
   Assaulting the president or vice president is a federal crime, a
felony in the U.S. code.
   The man called to Quayle from about 20 feet away as the vice
president was getting into the limousine outside the Hart Senate
Office Building after a luncheon with senators, Beckwith said.
   Quayle looked up and the flying roll of papers glanced off his
head after first striking the car, Secret Service spokesman Alan
Cramer said.
   The Capitol police assist the Secret Service in blocking
pedestrian traffic in situations involving the vice president's
motorcade near the Capitol, Cramer said.
   ``This guy kind of broke through the ranks,'' he said.

<HEAD>Famed Crossing Point at Berlin Wall To Be Dismantled</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For decades, Checkpoint Charlie has been the
best-known crossing through the now-crumbling Berlin Wall, a site of
demonstrations against hard-line East German Communist leaders and
daring dashes to freedom.
   On Wednesday, the U.S. military announced that the Cold War
symbol _ a small building in the middle of a roadway _ will soon be
dismantled.
   Until last year's peaceful revolution in East Germany, people
seeking the release of relatives barred from joining them in the
West held demonstrations at the checkpoint, some holding up protest
signs for weeks.
   Frequently, East German guards photographed anyone they found
suspicious.
   The checkpoint provided millions of visitors with the feeling
they were witnessing something truly dangerous.
   ``You are leaving the American sector,'' reads a bold sign at
Checkpoint Charlie. The warning is repeated in French and Russian.
   Tourists would simply strode by the checkpoint to the East German
control stations 66 feet across the boundary line.
   In a drab building at the East German outpost, stern-faced guards
would scrutinize passports.
   The clanging, metal doors _ opened by buzzers _ and the
ceiling-mounted mirrors that let Communist guards check right down
to people's feet were a chilling reminder of the differences between
East and West.
   The crossing itself was designed for use by non-Germans.
   Occasionally, brave or foolhardy East Germans tried to flee
through the maze of concrete and steel barriers set up by the
Communists.
   Usually, East German guards or bullets stopped them. Sometimes it
worked.
   In January 1986, East Berlin construction worker Andreas Bratke
made what must have seemed the longest dash of his 23 years,
sprinting through Checkpoint Charlie and into the West.
   Eight months later, Hans-Joachim Pofahl piled his girlfriend and
her infant daughter into the front of a loaded gravel truck and
barreled through the crossing and into the West in a blaze of
Communist gunfire.
   Abutting the western side of the crossing is the Haus am
Checkpoint Charlie museum _ rooms crammed with cars and other means
used in daredevil escapes. Photographs document escapes by East
Germans over the Berlin Wall, which was built in August 1961 to stem
a westward exodus.
   Other crossings existed, but Checkpoint Charlie was No. 1 in the
public's imagination, the crossing that became famous the world over.
   When the Berlin Wall was opened on Nov. 9, ecstatic East Germans
ran, drove and shoved through Checkpoint Charlie on their way to the
West _ for many, the first time in their lives.
   Despite the changes, troops of World War II allies France,
Britain and the United States have continued to man the checkpoint.
   East Germans have also continued to check those entering and
leaving East Berlin, and have not said what they will do with their
buildings.
   But the economic and monetary union of the two Germanys is due on
July 1, and all border checks are to end in less than a month.

<TEXT>
   The state that started the nation's tax revolt
12 years ago is taking down the barricades. Californians have voted
to double their gasoline tax and raise billions for mass transit,
schools and the poor.
   Fearful of ever growing traffic jams and eventual automotive
gridlock, California voters agreed to shoulder an average of $60 a
year per motorist in new taxes and approved Proposition 111 by a
52-to-48 percent margin Tuesday.
   Under the measure, the state gas tax will go from 9 to 18 cents
per gallon, raising $15.5 billion for a 10-year freeway building and
improvement program.
   In total dollars, it's the largest tax increase in California
history.
   The measure came more than a decade after California's
Proposition 13 started the national tax revolt. Conservatives in a
dozen other states tried to copy California, and at least half
succeeded. The tax revolt also was credited with helping establish
the political climate that got Ronald Reagan elected in 1980.
   The chief sponsor of Proposition 111, conservative Republican
Gov. George Deukmejian, insists it was not an assault on the tax
revolt movement because it was a specific tax for a specific purpose
_ relief of traffic congestion.
   ``There is no evidence in these results whatsoever to indicate
that the public will now be supportive of a general tax increase
where the revenues would go into the general fund for the purpose of
expanding the size or scope of government,'' he said Wednesday.
   ``If there's a lesson to be learned from this it's that the
public will support a specific increase in revenues provided they
know exactly where that money is going to go. I don't see any other
lesson to be learned as a result of this vote on Proposition 111.''
   But others see the California vote quite differently.
   ``It really does end the tax revolt in California, and sends a
message to Washington which I dislike intensely,'' said conservative
economist Arthur Laffer, who helped win approval of the twin
foundations of the California tax revolt _ the property tax-slashing
Proposition 13 in 1978 and a lid on government spending the next
year.
   In fact, despite Deukmejian's words, Proposition 111 does far
more than raise taxes for highways and mass transit; it also eases
the spending limit initiatives.
   U.S. Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner said he was
delighted with the vote. He said it validates the Bush
adminstration's argument that voters are willing to raise taxes for
highways and other transportation needs.
   California's gas tax ranks 47th in the nation, well below the
national average of 15.8 cents a gallon. If other states' taxes stay
the same, California will rank 23rd after Proposition 111 goes into
full effect in five years.
   Proposition 111 was extremely popular in freeway-laced cities but
soundly rejected in the most rural regions.
   Supporters said the economy, environment and quality of life were
at stake in the vote, and the campaign played off the dramatic
demonstration of the need for freeway improvements in the wake of
recent California earthquakes.
   Voters also passed two bond measures, one a companion to
Proposition 111 and the other sponsored by environmentalists, that
will together provide nearly $3 billion for mass-transit rail
construction throughout the state.
   The ballot carried five other bond measures _ the most bond
funding for a single election in California history _ and voters
approved them all. They provide $150 million to house the homeless
and $2 billion to build prisons, make government buildings safer and
upgrade schools and universities.
   The impetus for passage of the gasoline tax and rail bonds was
the growing congestion on California's freeways. California's
population has been increasing about 10 times faster than the
capacity of its highways.
   As a result, the average freeway speed during rush hour has
dropped in Los Angeles and other urban areas to about 20 mph.
   Deukmejian maintained that was costing Californians millions of
dollars annually in wasted fuel and million of hours in wasted time.

<TEXT>
   Dr. Jack Kevorkian's suicide machine has
confronted Michigan legal authorities and lawmakers with the
possibility their state will become a haven for death-by-choice.
   Kevorkian, a retired pathologist, said he did nothing illegal
when Janet Adkins used his button-operated device to take her life
Monday in his van 40 miles from Detroit.
   Alexander Capron, professor of law and medicine at the University
of Southern California and chairman of Congress' biomedical ethics
advisory committee, said Wednesday that Michigan may have no legal
means to stop Kevorkian from helping someone else die.
   ``If the state decides that its present law doesn't prohibit
this, the Legislature will have to decide whether they want Michigan
to be the place that people come to get Kevorkianed,'' said Capron.
   Attorney General Frank Kelley acknowledged the laws of his state
left Kevorkian's status unclear but said the doctor could become a
test case.
   Because of where Mrs. Adkins died, the case is in the hands of
Oakland County Prosecutor Richard Thompson, who said a decision on
whether to charge Kevorkian might not be made for up to two months.
   Thompson did, however, request a temporary restraining order
preventing further use of Kevorkian's device in the county. Circuit
Judge Alice Gilbert refused Wednesday to grant that request but set
a hearing for Friday.
   Adkins, a 54-year-old Alzheimer's victim from Portland, Ore.,
died after Kevorkian attached her to his device and she pushed a
button to inject herself with lethal drugs.
   Had Adkins used the device in her home state, Kevorkian could
have gone to prison for 18 months or longer under a 1981 law.
Helping someone commit suicide in Oregon is manslaughter, said Phil
Lemman, spokesman for the state Department of Justice.
   Prosecutors cited two precedents in Michigan that could influence
the Kevorkian case.
   In 1920, the state Supreme Court upheld the murder conviction of
man who placed a bottle of poison within reach of his wife, who
wanted to commit suicide, Thompson said. But the state Court of
Appeals decided in 1983 that a man who gave a gun to a friend who
used it to commit suicide shouldn't have been charged, he said.
   The appeals court said the high court in 1920 had gone too far in
extending responsibility for murder to a second party, said James
Shonkwiler, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys
Association of Michigan.
   ``Murder, by statute, requires that the actor _ the accused _ is
the instrument, the cause, of death,'' he said. ``There's an
intervening step when the victim acts of his own free will.
   ``It is by no means clear that Dr. Kevorkian committed a crime,''
Shonkwiler said. ``You have to reach to get to that. The question
is, whose will prevailed in the case _ his, or the patient's? That's
not clear.''

<HEAD>Former U.S. Soldier Found Guilty of Treason, Gets Life Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KOBLENZ, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the first case of a foreign
resident being tried for espionage in West Germany, a former U.S.
soldier has been sentenced to life in prison for passing NATO
secrets to the East over a decade.
   The Rhineland Palatinate state court convicted former Army Sgt.
1st Class Clyde Lee Conrad, 43, of treason on Wednesday.
   It found that the Sebring, Ohio, native had passed classified
material to the Hungarian and Czechoslovak secret services from 1975
through 1985, and received about $1.2 million for his efforts.
   Chief Judge Ferdinand Schuth said the former sergeant
``endangered the entire defense capability of the West.'' In reading
the judgment, the judge said Conrad's motive for spying was ``pure
greed.''
   He said had war broken out, the information Conrad passed to the
then-Soviet bloc countries ``could have led to a breakdown in the
defenses of the Western alliance,'' and ``to capitulation and the
use of nuclear weapons on German territory.''
   Schuth sentenced Conrad to life imprisoment for spying for the
Hungarians. He said Conrad was also guilty of spying for
Czechoslovakia on a lesser scale, and sentenced him to four years in
prison on that charge.
   Conrad had been in charge of the 8th Infantry's classified
document center. Documents he had access to included NATO strategic
war plans and other highly sensitive information. The prosecution in
the trial, which began Jan. 18, said Conrad planned to continue
spying for the Hungarians even after his discharge.
   Maj. Robin Higgins, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon in Washington,
said she was unaware of the sentence and that the department would
have no immediate comment.
   ABC News reported Wednesday that authorities were investigating
another former U.S. Army sergeant, Roderick Ramsay, in connection
with the Conrad case. It said Conrad had recruited Ramsay into the
spy ring when both were stationed at the 8th Infantry Division in
Bad Krueznach, 50 miles west of Frankfurt.
   The report, which quoted unidentified U.S. sources, said Ramsay
had been talking with the FBI. It said the espionage ring had, among
other things, smuggled computer parts from the United States to the
East bloc via Canada.
   Conrad was arrested Aug. 23, 1988 on suspicion of heading a West
German-based spy ring with Eastern contacts in Sweden and Vienna,
Austria.
   He had spent 20 years in the Army, returing in September 1985,
and had lived in West Germany since his discharge.
   Except for a period from September 1979 to November 1980, when he
was based in the United States, Conrad served with the 8th Infantry
in West Germany from 1975 until his discharge. He was in charge of
the classified document center during the majority of his time with
the unit.
   According to court records, Conrad was introduced to the
Hungarian secret service in late autumn of 1975 by his supervisor in
the 8th Infantry Division, former U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Zoltan
Szabo.
   Szabo, who was convicted of espionage in Austria in 1989,
received a 10-month suspended sentence. He identified for
investigators some of the documents the court said Conrad sold to
the Hungarians.
   Szabo provided the information against Conrad in a sworn
statement to the court and did not come to West Germany for the
trial.
   Two Hungarians, Sandor Kercsik and his brother, Imre, were
described by the court as Conrad's main contacts.
   The two were arrested in 1988 in Sweden and admitted to being
agents of the Hungarian secret police. They were sentenced to 18
months in prison for possessing NATO defense material.
   The Kercsik brothers also provided statements to the Rhineland
Palatinate state court with evidence implicating Conrad.

<HEAD>Thousands of Soviet Immigrants Living on Land Seized in 1967 War</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to RESTORE first reference to survey. Picks

<TEXT>
   Nearly 4,000 Soviet Jews are living on land
Israel seized from Jordan in 1967, despite Israeli statements that
the Soviet Jewish presence on occupied territory is minuscule.
   Still, a survey completed Wednesday indicated that the scope of
the immigration to the occupied West Bank and Arab east Jerusalem is
far short of the mass influx feared by Arab states.
   Movement to those areas constitutes only a small percentage of
the 51,700 Jews who have arrived since the Soviet Union liberalized
its emigration policies in the spring of 1989.
   The Israeli government said this week that just 318 Soviet
immigrants have moved into the West Bank, seized from Jordan in the
1967 Middle East war.
   But the survey by The Associated Press indicated that in addition
to those on the West Bank, more than 3,400 Soviets have moved to
five suburbs of Arab east Jerusalem since 1989.
   Although Israel took east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war,
it annexed it and does not consider the suburbs occupied territory.
   The issue of settling Soviet Jews on land captured in the 1967
war has become critical to the future flow of immigrants, projected
to reach 20,000 a month this year.
   In response to pressure from Arab states, Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev last weekend threatened to limit exit permits
for Soviet Jews if Israel does not heed appeals to keep Jews from
the occupied areas.
   But the Soviet Union appears to have retracted that threat, a
senior U.S. official said on condition of anonymity Wednesday. The
official said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze had
told Secretary of State James A. Baker III that Soviet emigration
policy would not be altered.
   Israel's government says it has no policy of settling Soviet Jews
on occupied territory. But Foreign Minister Moshe Arens told
Parliament on Wednesday that the new immigrants are free to settle
wherever they want, including the occupied lands.
   Arab leaders contend the flood of Soviet immigrants could
ultimately displace the 1.7 million Palestinians who live in east
Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. They say it might undercut
Palestinian efforts to form an independent state.
   To date, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing government
has given only figures for Jews living in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. They say 10 percent have settled in Jerusalem, but refuse to
give figures for how many are moving to annexed areas of the
disputed capital.
   The Israeli Absorption Ministry said this week that 318 Soviet
immigrants have moved to the West Bank, joining the 70,000 Jewish
settlers. No Soviet Jews are known to be living in the Gaza Strip.
   Spot checks of settlements in the West Bank indicated the
government figure was accurate. But the AP survey found 1,140 new
Soviet immigrant families registered and received services at
neighborhood community centers in five suburbs of Arab east
Jerusalem in little more than a year.
   Based on government estimates that there are three to four people
in each Soviet immigrant family, the total in Jerusalem translates
to 3,420 to 4,560 immigrants in annexed areas.
   Absorption Ministry spokeswoman Ida Ben-Shitreet refused to
confirm or deny the estimate. She said the ministry did not
distinguish between immigrants settled in Jewish west Jerusalem or
the Arab eastern sector because government policy is to consider
Jerusalem a united city.
   City spokeswoman Bonnie Boxer said she believed the figure of up
4,560 immigrants in annexed areas of Jerusalem was ``too high.'' But
she did not provide statistics.
   Earlier this year, President Bush upset Israeli officials when he
restated the long-standing but infrequently expressed U.S. policy
that views east Jerusalem as occupied land.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's chief index rose
moderately today, while the dollar dipped after a seven-day rise
against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 239.00 points, or 0.73
percent, closing at 33,192.50. The index rose 31.88 points Wednesday.
   Traders said market players were making arbitrage purchases in
the spot market in an attempt to take profits by selling in the
futures market today, the last day for June futures contracts.
   ``The market was at first very cautious because of the chance of
heavy sales linked to the expiration of June contracts today, but
the index remained strong as the morning gain reassured
participants,'' said Kazuhiro Nomura, a trader with New Japan
Securities Co.
   But trading lacked direction, he added.
   Akihiro Sezaki, a trader with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru Securities
Co., said many investors rolled their June futures over into
September contracts.
   Trading was moderate, with first section volume estimated at 650
million shares, up from Wednesday's 600 million.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 152.55 yen, down 0.05
yen from Wednesday's close of 152.60 yen. It opened at 152.49 yen
and ranged between 152.40 yen and 152.56 yen.
   Before today's dip, the dolar had gained 3.15 yen in seven
trading days.
   ``The currency rates hardly moved in the absence of
market-affecting news,'' said Mamoru Tabata, a dealer with the
Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   He said market players felt no immediate need to change positions
with the dollar in the 152-153 yen range.
   ``Unless there is an announcement of changing U.S. monetary
policies or the resignation of (Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev,
the dollar-yen rate would be stuck at the current level,'' Tabata
said.
   About $2.88 billion changed hands in spot trading, down from
$7.53 billion the previous day.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 87.94 points at 5 p.m. (4 a.m.
EDT) from Wednesday's 87.89-point close. The yield was 6.980
percent, down from 6.990 percent the previous day.

   Michael Jackson apparently bruised
his ribs during a vigorous dance workout in his bedroom, causing the
chest pains that put him in the hospital, his doctor says.
   Tests of Jackson's heart and lungs revealed no abnormalities, Dr.
Mark Zatzkis, a cardiologist, said Wednesday in a statement.
   The singer should be released from St. Johns Hospital and Health
Center this week, said Jackson spokesman Bob Jones.
   Jackson had complained of chest pains when he went to the
hospital Sunday. He suffered costochondritis, or inflammation of the
cartilage in the front part of the ribs, Zatzkis said.
   He apparently hurt himself during a two-hour solo dance session,
his regular Sunday routine, at his Los Angeles home. Jackson demands
to be left alone during the workout, ``and no one dares disturb
him,'' Jones said.
   Later Wednesday, Jackson's brothers Jackie, Marlon and Randy
arrived at the hospital to visit him.
   Security guards handed a man over to police for allegedly making
threats against Jackson. Jacki Lee Adams, 28, was arrested after
saying he was going to kill the singer, said Sgt. John Meile.
   Adams was booked for investigation of giving false information to
police, trespassing and threatening bodily harm.

<HEAD>Shining Path Rebels Have Formed New Urban Front, Garcia Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY LYNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shining Path rebels have formed a new front to
push their insurgency into Lima and other coastal urban areas,
President Alan Garcia said after two powerful car bombs exploded
within blocks of the Government Palace.
   Garcia spoke Wednesday in an atmosphere of stepped up rebel
attacks in Lima and a series of weekend raids around the capital
that resulted in the seizure of five Shining Path safe houses and 31
arrests.
   The president, who leaves office July 28, said the newly formed
People's Defense Revolutionary Movement, is the ``urban,
metropolitan organ of the Shining Path.''
   The Maoist-inspired Shining Path operates in at least half of
Peru, especially in the mountains and jungle, but has had little
success in expanding to coastal cities.
   At least 18,500 people have been killed in political violence
related to the decade-old insurgency, which was launched in the
Andean highlands.
   The Shining Path draws much of its support from indigenous
peoples resentful of the economic and political dominance in the
country of 22 million of descendants of European immigrants.
   The wave of violence comes four days before a presidential runoff
that pits novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, a free-market activist,
against centrist agricultural engineer Alberto Fujimori.
   The Shining Path has called on voters to boycott Sunday's vote
and threatened election day ``armed strikes'' in Andean cities.
   In one of the guerrilla safehouses raided in an upper-class Lima
suburb, police found tons of Shining Path documents and propaganda.
   They also found personal possessions that apparently belonged to
Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman.
   Garcia said he believed the raids proved that ``the chief of
terrorism actively participates'' in Shining Path operations.
   Guzman went underground in 1979 and, over the years, there have
been numerous rumors he was dead.
   The raids also proved that the new urban front has been formed,
Garcia said: ``The people who were captured were essential to the
new movement.''
   Two people were injured in the car bombings near the Government
Palace on Tuesday night and Wednesday and Garcia called the upsurge
in urban violence a ``desperate response'' to the weekend raids.
   In other violence Wednesday in Lima, a city of 6 million, four
rebels armed with machine guns took over a neighborhood electoral
office.
   They forced the electoral workers outside and set fire to the
office. Firefighters said the blaze destroyed most of the documents
in the building, including identification for electoral workers.
   Guerrillas blew up at least three high-tension power pylons
Tuesday night, blacking out parts of the capital and other coastal
cities where most of Peru's 22 million people live.
   In pre-dawn attacks Wednesday, guerrillas threw gasoline bombs at
a city bus and at a stove factory owned by a senator-elect of
Fujimori's Change 90 party, according to police.
   Tuesday's car bomb went off behind Lima's Roman Catholic
cathedral, which faces the main plaza where the Government Palace is
located. Police said the cathedral was not damaged, but one passerby
was wounded.
   Operating out of its stronghold in Ayacucho, the Shining Path has
spread throughout Peru's highlands since it launched its armed
insurgency in May 1980.
   The movement, which seeks to impose a peasant-worker state, also
controls much of Peru's jungle. Efforts to move into Lima's
sprawling shantytowns, however, have been countered by strong police
crackdowns.

<HEAD>Warsaw Pact Gathers to Debate United Germany, Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warsaw Pact leaders gathered in Moscow today to
debate the consequences of a united Germany and address the future
of their military alliance in a Europe where a new security order is
expected to emerge.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said Tuesday that
the Pact would seek a ``transformation'' at the meeting.
   On the eve of the gathering, Hungary's prime minister said he
would tell Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that the Warsaw
Pact is outmoded.
   ``We intend to make it clear that the Warsaw Pact as a political
organization, reflecting confrontation in Europe, is outdated,''
Prime Minister Jozsef Antall said in Budapest.
   Antall has said he wishes to take his country out of the
seven-member Warsaw Pact, but will not make any such move without
the consent of all of the pact countries.
   The alliance was formed in 1955 under Soviet domination, but last
year's democratic upheaval in Poland, Hungary, East Germany,
Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria ended longtime subservience to
Moscow.
   Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have even called for a united
Germany to be a member of the NATO alliance, which the Soviets
oppose.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said the Warsaw Pact
leaders would discuss ``the problems of the all-European structure,
disarmament, and strengthening security on the continent, the
further cooperation of the members of the Warsaw Pact.''
   It added said ``great attention'' would be given to the question
of a united Germany, and the integration of the Warsaw Pact and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization in a new all-European security
structure.
   Tass said Gorbachev would report on his summit with President
Bush and in Washington last week. The Warsaw Pact meeting includes
political and military leaders as well as foreign ministers of the
member countries.
   Gorbachev and Bush did not settle their differences over a united
Germany's military allegiance. The U.S. president _ and Chancellor
Helmut Kohl of West Germany _ want the new Germany to be in the
Western military alliance.
   Continuing efforts to settle the differences, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and Shevardnadze met in Copenhagen just days
after the summit.
   Baker presented a nine-point package aimed at easing Soviet
worries about a united Germany. In turn, he said the Soviet Union
had made a new proposal. He did not elaborate.
   Among the Warsaw Pact leaders attending the conference is East
German Prime Minister Lothar de Maziere, who will then travel to
Washington for talks.

<HEAD>Texas Works Out School-Finance Overhaul</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Legislature gave final approval to a
$528 million school finance package the governor promises to sign,
ending months of wrangling over how to meet a court over to steer
more money to poor districts.
   ``I think it's a great step forward. We made some very
significant changes in the way we're going to do business in public
education in the state of Texas,'' Republican Gov. Bill Clements
said Wednesday.
   In bills passed Tuesday and Wednesday, the House and Senate
approved education reforms, budget cuts, fund transfers and a
quarter-cent boost in the state sales tax, now 6 cents on the
dollar, to help pay for the package.
   Clements killed two previous plans because they relied on a
half-cent increase.
   But he said he agreed to the quarter-cent increase as a
compromise and to fend off the prospect of a court-written funding
plan. A judge had previously assigned a court master to write a plan
if the Legislature failed to do so.
   The governor said he is optimistic the tax increase will be
rescinded in next year's session.
   The overhaul became necessary when the state Supreme Court in
October declared Texas' school-finance system unconstitutional
because of big disparities in spending between rich and poor
districts in the 3.1 million-student system.
   As in most states, schools in Texas are supported primarily by
local property taxes.
   ``I think that what we have passed here and what we have agreed
upon will more than satisfy the courts,'' Clements said. ``I think
this will lay it to rest.''
   Courts have struck down school finance systems in a dozen states
in recent years. The others are Kentucky, New Jersey, Kansas,
Wisconsin, California, Connecticut, Washington, West Virginia,
Wyoming, Arkansas and Montana.
   The Democratic-controlled Legislature has been meeting since
February, holding four special sessions on school-finance reform.
   The $528 million would be pumped into the $13.5 billion-a-year
school finance system in the upcoming academic year.
   Among other things, the package would increase testing of
students and give the governor authority to appoint the state
education commissioner. The commissioner now is appointed by the
state Board of Education.
   Some lawmakers said the legislation does not go far enough to
meet the Supreme Court order. ``Members, we will be back. ... Don't
fool yourself. We haven't resolved the issue,'' said Rep. Gregory
Luna, a Democrat.

   Nursing homes held bake sales and waitresses
donated their tips to help raise the $60,000 ransom demanded by
Colombian kidnappers holding a former Peoria man more than a month.
   Donations to help free Scott Heimdal, 27, came in from across the
country after his parents, Roy and Marge Heimdal, appealed for help.
   ``We sat at the kitchen table last night and cried,'' Mrs.
Heimdal said Wednesday. ``We just couldn't believe the generosity of
total strangers.''
   The captors had demanded $1.2 million for Heimdal's release but
later lowered the figure. They have threatened to kill him unless
the money is delivered to their jungle hideout by Monday.
   Mrs. Heimdal said $17,000 had come in by late Wednesday to a bank
that set up a trust fund, and more than $900 was donated at their
home.
   ``All the waitresses at Jumer's Restaurant donated their tips.
Nursing homes have been holding bake sales. A collection was taken
up at the Peoria Chiefs baseball game last night,'' Mrs. Heimdal
said.
   ``And people have been putting envelopes inside our door with
money. They're trying to help save our son's life.''
   Heimdal, who headed a dredging operation for a gold mining
company in Ecuador, was kidnapped along the Colombian border April
28 by a Maoist guerilla group known as the Popular Liberation Army,
said the U.S. Embassy in Quito, Ecuador.
   State Department spokesman Dave Denny said Wednesday the family
was advised not to pay any ransom, in keeping with U.S. policy,
``but families are free to do what they must do.''
   The Heimdals took their appeal to the public because their life
savings were wiped out seven years ago when Mrs. Heimdal was
seriously injured in an accident with a drunken driver.

<HEAD>De Klerk Expected to End State of Emergency</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Speech scheduled at 8:30 a.m EDT.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SAHM VENTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most leading newspapers today
quoted government officials as saying President F.W. de Klerk would
likely end the four-year-old state of emergency in an address to
Parliament later in the day.
   The emergency laws, which include some of the harshest
restrictions on political activity ever imposed by South Africa's
white rulers, must be renewed by midnight Friday if they are to
remain in effect.
   Beeld, an Afrikaans-language newspaper with strong ties to the
government, said the only decision yet to be made was whether the
emergency would be lifted totally or partially.
   The African National Congress and other leading anti-apartheid
groups have made the repeal of the emergency one of their
preconditions for full-scale negotiations with the government on a
new constitution.
   Most English-language newspapers quoted government sources as
saying the emergency decree would be totally lifted. They said the
government would rely on previous security legislation passed by
Parliament to control unrest and political violence.
   Most papers based their predictions on Wednesday's six-hour
Cabinet meeting, at which the emergency was discussed at length. The
Star, the nation's largest daily, said there were ``strong
indications that the Cabinet decided ... to end the emergency.''
   The Citizen, a pro-government Johannesburg newspaper, said:
   ``Government sources indicated the end of the state of emergency
in its entirety would be more in line with with Mr. De Klerk's moves
to normalize South African society as soon as possible than a
partial lifting of the emergency.''
   Many of the emergency regulations are duplicated in existing
legislation, but the emergency decree allowed the government and
police to bypass the courts in detaining people without trial,
banning political activity, suspending newspapers and censoring
public speech.
   The emergency decree also protected police against prosecution.
   De Klerk has said he would lift the state of emergency if
authorities were confident they could control violence, particularly
in the northeastern province of Natal, where more than 500 blacks
died in factional fighting in the first three months of this year.
   Business Day in Johannesburg said senior government officials
expected de Klerk to announce that violence in Natal would be dealt
with under the existing Public Safety Act. The act enables the
minister of law and order to declare the province an unrest area.
   Some newspapers said that ending the state of emergency at this
time could be seen as an opportunity to undermine ANC leader Nelson
Mandela's calls for continued sanctions against South Africa.
   Mandela is on a six-week trip to Europe, North America and
Africa. He was scheduled to meet with French President Francois
Mitterrand in Paris at about the same time de Klerk was to address
Parliament.
   Business Day quoted Mandela as saying in a French television
interview Monday: ``If France reduces sanctions, then the South
African government will slow down the rhythm of change.''
   Business Day said, ``Mitterrand indicated in talks with De Klerk
last month that he would be willing to call for a reassesment of
(European Community) policy towards South Africa if the emergency
was lifted, political prisoners released and exiles allowed to
return.''
   ``If they lift it the situation will become chaotic,'' said
Moolman Mentz, spokesman for the pro-apartheid Conservative Party.
``They couldn't cope with the violence even with the state of
emergency because they were not applying it. Our view is the
government is trying to appease everybody.''

   Eight anti-nuclear protesters were arrested
for dangling from a bridge in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the
battleship New Jersey from entering the Columbia River.
   The Greenpeace protesters used climbing equipment to attach
themselves to the 205-foot-high, 4{-mile-long bridge Wednesday. Each
held a banner that read ``Nuclear Free Seas.''
   They lowered themselves as much as 50 feet but remained a safe
height above the battleship, police said. They climbed back up and
were charged with criminal trespass, said state police Lt. Bob
Pendleton.
   He said the eight would remain in jail pending federal charges of
violating the safety zone around the ship.
   Greenpeace spokeswoman Cynthia Rust said group succeeded in
getting across its message that nuclear missiles it believes are
aboard the New Jersey are endangering the people of Oregon and
Washington.
   The Navy does not say whether its ships are carrying nuclear
weapons.

   Eleven Japanese fishermen were missing after their
boat collided with a Norwegian freighter and sank today off the
island of Miyake-jima, authorities said.
   A Maritime Safety Agency agency official, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said four Japanese fishermen were rescued after the
ship sank.
   It was not immediately known how many fishermen were on aboard
the ship, the official said.
   He said the two ships, the 10,986-ton Nopal Cherry of Lorentzen
Shipping Co. of Norway and the Yugen-maru, collided about 50 miles
east of Miyake-jima, which is about 100 miles south of Tokyo.
   The official said no other details were immediately available.

   Thunderstorms were over the mid-Mississippi and Ohio valleys
early today, and light rain dampened parts of the East, central
Plains and Pacific Northwest.
   Extreme heat lingered in the desert Southwest and southern
Plains. Temperatures were expected to hit 110 degrees today in
Arizona.
   Thunderstorms Wednesday spawned nine tornadoes in Colorado, five
in Kentucky and three in Indiana, the National Weather Service said.
   Heavy thunderstorms were expected today in eastern Kansas,
northern Arkansas and Missouri. Isolated thunderstorms were likely
in Florida, and thunderstorms, some severe, were expected in parts
of the Midwest.
   Thunderstorms with winds gusting into the high 60s and low 70s
uprooted trees Wednesday in parts of Kentucky and Tenneesse.
   Low atmospheric pressure in the Dakotas was expected to draw
moisture from the central Plains and Mississippi Valley and create
thunderstorms in southern Minnesota and the eastern Dakotas.
   There were showers early today in Philadelphia and the along the
New England coast.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation. Skies were
fair across much of the southwestern and south-central United States.
   The high for the nation Wednesday was 109 degrees at Wink, Texas.

<HEAD>Gold Falls Sharply, Dollar Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold prices fell sharply in Europe this morning,
touching a four-year low in London. The dollar rose in moderate
trading.
   In early London dealings, gold fell briefly to $351.50, its
lowest level since July 1986. The movement was a carry over of Asian
selling after the Sydney market took gold through $355, a key chart
level, dealers said.
   The move below that chart level, which has been anticipated for
weeks, came on the back of Australian producer selling in what was
essentially a thin market, they said.
   Gold's fall, however, continued through Asian dealings and into
early European trading.
   Gold rebounded briefly to $355 on a flurry of Middle East buying
orders at the day's low, dealers said.
   But apparent profit-taking by Middle East investors, along with
fears that large Arab players in the gold market would move to push
bullion lower again, brought fresh selling into the market.
   ``It was just a matter of time before it broke $355,'' a Zurich
dealer said.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $353.50 a troy ounce,
down from $359.50 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $353.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $352.25, down from $358.60 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $5.75 to close at a bid $355.67.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $4.99 a troy ounce from
Wednesday's $5.085.
   Foreign exchange traders said the U.S. currency was in good
demand, though dominated by political considerations rather than new
economic data.
   Traders identified uncertainty about unrest in the Soviet Union
and about the impact of German monetary union as the two major
themes boosting the dollar.
   Investors also were reassured by indications from Federal Reserve
officials that U.S. interest rates would probably maintain current
levels, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins, the
dollar fell 0.05 yen to a closing 152.55 yen. Later, in London, it
was quoted at a higher rate of 152.67 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.6935 West German marks, up from 1.6870
   _1.4381 Swiss francs, up from 1.4280
   _5.7088 French francs, up from 5.6870
   _1.9005 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8980
   _1,245.50 Italian lire, up from 1,241.00
   _$1.1700 Canadian, down from $1.1723
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, which was
quoted at $1.6860, compared with $1.6880 late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Explorers Reach World War II Bomber Buried in Greenland Icecap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM E. SCHULZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHAMBLEE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Explorers bored a 250-foot shaft through the
Greenland icecap to a B-17 bomber buried since World War II, said a
sponsor who was awaiting word today of their findings.
   ``They're going to try to enlarge the hole to get into a hatch,''
Pat Epps, president of the Greenland Expedition Society, said
Wednesday.
   One plan was to use hot water from the thermal borer that cut
through the Arctic ice to enlarge the bottom of the shaft. If that
doesn't work, ``somebody has to go down there with electric chain
saws and carve around the airplane,'' Epps said.
   Epps, who had been on the icecap with the expedition until last
week, heard by radio from Greenland on Wednesday morning that the
expedition succeeded in reaching the plane.
   The bomber is one of two B-17s and six twin-engine, P-38
Lightning fighters that crash-landed when they ran out of fuel after
being decoyed by false radio transmissions from German submarines
while en route to Europe in 1942.
   Epps and Atlanta architect Richard Taylor formed an expedition to
find and salvage the planes.
   This year, the third consecutive year the men flew to the icecap,
a team led by Taylor used a thermal borer to drill the 42-inch
diameter shaft to the B-17 named Big Stoop.
   A second team, led by Angelo Pizzagalli of Burlington, Vt., used
a huge auger to bore a hole 16 feet in diameter toward a P-38.
   Epps, who hopes to fly one of the P-38s off the icecap, said
plans call for getting all six fighters out by Sept. 1.
   The eight planes crash-landed July 15, 1942. Their crews camped
in one of the B-17s for nine days until rescuers arrived on dog
sleds.
   In the early 1970s, Col. Carl Rudder, one of the P-38 pilots,
mentioned the planes to Roy Degan, a commercial airline pilot who
brought the idea of an Arctic expedition to Epps.
   The explorers eventually obtained search and salvage rights from
Denmark, which administers Greenland.
   In 1988, the society found the aircraft using low-frequency
subsurface radar. Last year, expedition members drilled down to the
B-17 and brought back poker chip-size pieces of its skin.
   Epps estimated his group will have spent $800,000 to $1 million
by Sept. 1, financed by fund raising and Rolls Ltd., Pizzagalli's
non-profit corporation in Vermont.

   The prophet Isaiah spoke of beating swords

   The Air Force is cutting up 443 land-based cruise missiles, many
of which have been deployed in Europe, as part of the Intermediate
Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The treaty lets Soviet inspectors
verify the destruction, which they were doing Wednesday at
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.
   ``And lo and behold, in one of the transporter erector launchers
a bird had built a nest and was sitting on its eggs,'' said Air
Force Lt. Col. Robert Yablonski, who headed the American On-Site
Inspection Agency team escorting the Soviets.
   ``And I think that's a good sign for us, it's a good sign for
peace, it's a good sign of the cooperative effort between our two
sides in building strategic stability in a world that will be
peaceful.''
   In all, 268 Air Force missiles and 83 launchers have been
eliminated, all at Davis-Monthan, since October 1988.

<TEXT>
   State medical regulators have joined prosecutors
in investigating Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the suicide-machine inventor
treading the line separating outsider from outlaw.
   The Department of Licensing and Regulation launched a probe
Wednesday of the 62-year-old retired pathologist who hooked an
Alzheimer's victim to the drug-injecting apparatus and let her take
her life with the press of a button.
   ``Our role is to gather the facts and evidence and determine what
occurred,'' said Mary MacDowell, director of the department's Health
Investigation Division.
   Evidence of a violation of regulations would be referred to the
state Board of Medicine, which could reprimand Kevorkian or lift his
license, MacDowell said.
   Meanwhile, Oakland County Prosecutor Richard Thompson has not
decided whether to charge Kevorkian with a crime in the death Monday
of Janet Adkins. Attorney General Frank Kelley acknowledged the
state has no clear-cut law against assisting in a suicide.
   State Police impounded the suicide machine, but Circuit Judge
Alice Gilbert on Wednesday denied Thompson's request for an order
barring further use of the device. The judge set another hearing for
Friday.
   Kevorkian, who scorns the medical mainstream as too timid,
defended the machine amid the fierce legal and ethical debate its
use has stirred. He said a duplicate device could be built within
days, but he did not say whether he has arranged other suicides.
   ``What I'm doing is absolutely ethical,'' Kevorkian said
Wednesday on ABC's ``Nightline.'' ``Of course it's audacious, but
somebody has to do it. Doctors weren't going to tell anybody, and
patients out there want it.''
   Mrs. Adkins, 54, had been diagnosed a year ago with Alzheimer's,
an incurable disease that leads to progressive deterioration of the
brain, and had traveled 2,000 miles from her home in Portland, Ore.,
to die through the use of Kevorkian's machine.
   Having read about the device, ``She thought that sounded like a
very, very humane and painless way to end her life,'' her husband,
Ronald Adkins, said on ``Nightline.''
   Kevorkian drove with Mrs. Adkins to a park and attached her to
the electric-powered device in the back of his van. Mrs. Adkins
pressed a button that delivered chemicals that stopped her heart.
Death came within minutes, Kevorkian said.
   Kevorkian said he offered his device at no cost and would do so
for anyone else wanting him to help them die.
   ``Everyone says to me, `Hey, you're taking on yourself like God.'
Well, then, come on and do something,'' he said in an interview on a
plaza bench outside city hall in the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak.
``If it's legal, let me do it. If it's illegal, stop me.''
   The state Medical Board never has disciplined Kevorkian,
MacDowell said. But his support of doctor-assisted euthanasia is
only one aspect of a medical career that has placed him well outside
the mainstream of his profession.
   He has advocated medical experimentation on death-row inmates and
the use of cadavers' blood in transfusions. Known to friends as
``Dr. Death,'' he scorns the medical community, which he said is
cowed by the influence of religion.
   In 1988, Kevorkian asked the Hemlock Society, which advocates the
right to death on demand, to refer terminally ill members to a
center he wanted to open in California, founder and executive
director Derek Humphry said.
   ``I persuaded him not to take up in California,'' Humphry said
from the Netherlands, where he was presiding over an international
convention on right-to-die issues. ``We didn't want to be involved
in lawbreaking.''
   The Pontiac native received his medical degree in 1952 from the
University of Michigan. Colleagues said he was a medical maverick by
the time he completed his residency in 1958.
   ``He's a loner,'' said Dr. Murray Levin, an internal medicine
specialist in Bloomfield Hills. ``He's dropped out of medical
circles as far as I know. It bothers me why a guy so competent ...
is retired.''
   ``He's always been a free thinker,'' said Dr. Gerald Abrams, a
former classmate of Kevorkian's and now a professor of pathology at
the University of Michigan medical school. ``He always impressed us
as being very bright, very sincere. His aren't exactly mainstream
ideas.''
   Kevorkian worked from 1959 to 1966 at Pontiac General Hospital,
then operated a diagnostic clinic in Southfield for three years.
From 1969 to 1976, he was laboratory director at Saratoga General
Hospital in Detroit, then worked at several small hospitals in the
Los Angeles area before returning to Michigan.
   Unable to find work within a medical community hostile to his
views, Kevorkian said, he retired in 1982 to study ethics, write
articles for European medical and law journals. His friends recalled
the surrealistic oil paintings he produced about 15 years ago with
medical themes _ and titles like ``Nausea,'' ``Fever'' and ``Coma.''
   ``They're pretty powerful,'' Kevorkian said. ``They're not great
art, but they've got a lot of impact. I like to shake people up.''

   Food service workers with AIDS would be denied
the full protection of civil rights legislation for the disabled
under an amendment endorsed by both houses of Congress.
   By a voice vote Wednesday, the Senate agreed to instruct its
negotiators reconciling House and Senate versions of the Americans
with Disabilities Act to accept the amendment in the House-passed
version of the bill.
   The Senate passed the bill last September by a 76-8 vote. The
House passed it, 403-20, last month.
   Although non-binding, the motion by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
reflected the Senate's attitude toward the amendment. Backed by the
restaurant industry, the amendment provides the only exemption for
any group of disabled people.
   Under the amendment, employers in food industries such as
restaurants and supermarkets could reassign workers infected with
the AIDS virus to areas where they would not be near food.
   The only other group exempted from the protections of the bill is
people _ such as pedophiles or pyromaniacs _ whose mental condition
leads to criminal behavior.
   The Americans with Disabilities Act would grant the same rights
to the estimated 43 million disabled Americans that the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 gave to blacks and other minorities.
   Opponents of the AIDS amendment argued that it flies in the face
of medical evidence about how the fatal disease is spread.
Supporters said restaurants would lose customers if they found out a
chef or other employee had AIDS.
   ``It sets us back in our fight against ignorance, it slows our
fight against discrimination, and it undercuts our fight against
AIDS,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
   AIDS is spread by intimate sexual contact, use of contaminated
hypodermic needles, and use of contaminated blood products,
according to medical authorities. Homosexual men and intravenous
drug users have been the main victims.
   Helms called the belief that AIDS is spread in limited ways
``conventional wisdom,'' and added: ``You try telling that to John
Q. Public.''
   The bill does not protect homosexuals or active drug users. Even
without the amendment, it doesn't protect anyone whose disease poses
a serious risk of contagion.
   The chief sponsors of the bill, Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., and
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said the amendment had been the only
serious difference between the House and Senate versions of the bill.
   Although the voice vote means no individual senator's vote is
known, the Senate had voted 53-40 to reject an earlier motion by
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, to kill Helms' motion.

   The death of a 6-year-old boy whose
disappearance spurred a citywide search has been ruled an accident.
   Matthew Roberts suffocated after he locked himself in the storage
compartment of a station wagon, officials said Wednesday. The
medical examiner's office said the boy likely climbed into the
18-by-18-by-12-inch compartment the day he disappeared, said Police
Chief Caleb Chandler.
   Matthew disappeared from his home May 8. His body was found May
23 when someone noticed a strong odor coming from the station wagon
parked in the family's driveway.
   About 10,000 people of Clovis' 25,000 residents joined the search
for the boy.
   ``We accept the results from the medical examiner's office,''
Geoff Roberts, Matthew's father, said Wednesday. ``We know our
little boy just fell asleep without suffering. It doesn't bring him
back, but it eases our mind.''
   General Motors Corp. recalled the cars in 1979 because the
self-latching compartment was considered dangerous to children. The
owner of the vehicle, a friend of the Roberts, has said he didn't
know the car had been recalled.

<HEAD>List of Major Emergency Regulations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The police and some Cabinet
ministers have had wide restrictive powers under the 4-year-old
national state of emergency. But many of the regulations have not
uniformly been enforced since President F.W. de Klerk came to power
in August.
   Many of the powers granted to police under the emergency
regulations already existed in security laws. However, the emergency
decree bypassed the courts, and granted police indemnity from
prosecution for any action they took ``in good faith'' under the
emergency.
   Here are some of the actions police and government ministers have
taken under the national emergency declared by former President P.W.
Botha on June 12, 1986:
   _More than 30,000 people, most of them black, were detained for
varying lengths of time without being charged with a crime. Some
were held for nearly three years. Some were as young as 11 years old.
   _Police did not have to tell inquiring relatives or lawyers
whether they had a missing person in detention, or give any
information about a detainee to anyone.
   _Newspapers were prohibited from reporting the names of detainees
without police permission, and it was illegal for anyone, including
freed detainees, to describe the circumstances of detention.
   _When they were released, the government could restrict former
detainees to their homes, prohibit them from working, meeting with
other people or participating in political activity, although they
had never been charged or convicted of a crime.
   _Police, without warrants, could search any person, building or
vehicle and seize anything they wanted.
   _Security officers could prohibit anyone from carrying out ``any
activities or acts whatsoever.''
   _More than 20 organizations were banned.
   _Several newspapers were temporarily suspended from publication.
   _Journalists were prohibited from being within sight of any
political unrest and were immediately arrested if spotted by police.
Tape recordings and film were seized without warrants.
   _Journalists were prohibited from reporting about any police
activity in connection with unrest unless police gave their
permission. Local newspapers were prohibited from indicating whether
news articles had been censored by the emergency regulations.
   _Certain T-shirts with slogans were made illegal. Police
confiscated political banners, flags and pamphlets under the
emergency regulations even though they were not prohibited under any
law passed by Parliament.
   _All outdoor political rallies and demonstrations were banned at
one time.
   _Police issued regulations for funerals, limiting the number of
mourners, designating who could speak, setting the time and place
for the burials.
   _The government banned ``subversive statements'' from being
uttered or reported. Calls for boycotts, strikes of foreign
sanctions; statements which might undermine the morale of the
military; and at one time, any call for the release of detainees,
were defined as subversive.

   The layers of mud on the floors, bathroom
fixtures and walls are not the only legacy of a week of record
flooding along the Trinity River. There are the snakes, fire ants
and huge furry spiders.
   And there's the oppressive odor of mold and dead fish.
   ``I used to be fussy, but now ...,'' Janet Messenger said, her
voice trailing off as she surveyed the damp floor, buckled walls and
ripped tile of her home on aptly named Mud Street. ``We've had a lot
of good times here. It's kind of sad. I don't think we're going to
stay.''
   Her husband, Charles, gets so upset about their plight he won't
even talk about it.
   Residents are trying to put their lives back together almost two
weeks after the water began receding on the Trinity just below the
Lake Livingston Dam in southeastern Texas. When torrential rain in
early May filled Lake Livingston to record levels, the dam gates
were opened wider than ever, flooding bottom land downstream.
   The river crested 30 feet above flood stage at nearby Liberty on
May 25. On Wednesday, the river was still 4 feet above the flood
mark at Liberty, which is about 70 miles northeast of Houston.
   Thirteen deaths were blamed on storms and flooding in northern
Texas that also extended into Louisiana and Oklahoma. No deaths or
injuries were blamed on the floods along the lower Trinity. But
lives were uprooted.
   ``It's a mess,'' said Dorothy Harrington, who measured more than
6{ feet of water in her house. ``A lot of people are selling out.
But we can't afford to and nobody's going to buy it anyway.''
   Her husband, Tom, used a scraper to remove inches of mud caked in
their garage. She scrubbed sinks and bathtubs in a race against
fuzzy green splotches of mold that thrive in the steamy climate.
   In their front yard, a picnic table, a fence, a squirrel feeder
high off the ground and a sign with their name and address were
covered with grass, leaves and dirt left behind when the water
receded.
   The retired couple rescued the dangling sign, wiped it off and
hung it properly.
   ``I start one place and end up doing something else,'' Mrs.
Harrington said during a break in her cleaning.
   Water was in the homes of the Camilla Twin Harbors subdivision,
adjacent to the dam, for seven days.
   What many residents wait for now is a visit from someone from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, which doles out government aid.
   John Pencavage, a FEMA agent who verifies claims, said he has
been in Texas since early May and expects to remain for several more
weeks. He says he wore out a camera taking pictures of damage and
hasn't had time to replace it.
   ``This is home for me _ all I've got left,'' Henry Prlka told
Pencavage.
   Eight feet of water left Prlka's air conditioner broken, his
telephone packed with mud and the white ceiling of his mobile home
green with mold.
   ``I'm leaving this time,'' he said. ``It's terrible what's
happened to us.''
   As of this week, FEMA had received 4,848 applications for aid
from Texas families and businesses, spokesman George Burgess said.
FEMA also had provided 2,168 families with more than $1.5 million in
temporary housing money and 538 families with $1.68 million in
grants for emergency aid or repairs not otherwise covered by the Red
Cross or insurance.
   Lonnie Trotti promised to remain and ``float out another one.''
   ``It's funny, sad, aggravating, heartbreaking,'' said Trotti, who
put his house on stilts after a flood a year ago and still got water
this time. ``But I do have a trailer. I can rebuild. And I've still
got a place to go fishing.''

<HEAD>Ailing High School Graduate Dies Hours After Ceremony</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Even during the last hours of his life,
Aaron Shoreys didn't give up on his goal of walking across an
auditorium stage to claim the high school diploma that meant so much.
   But in the end, the heart disease he fought all his life made him
too weak and he had to go home, where he later died in his mother's
arms.
   ``He wanted that diploma, he wanted to graduate so bad and he was
so sick,'' said Jane Shoreys, who had watched and waited with her
son for 15 months for a heart-lung transplant that never came.
   ``He never really said anything but I knew in my heart that it
was close to the end _ he was just so weak _ and I think he knew it,
too,'' she said.
   Mrs. Shoreys said her son's determination to graduate never
wavered, even though he was too ill to attend graduation rehearsal
Monday morning.
   ``In the afternoon, he said he had to go. He was in line ready to
get his diploma when the music started and he just became too weak
and we had to take him home.''
   The 18-year-old's death was tempered for his family by the
fulfillment of his dream to finish high school.
   ``It was a huge achievement to be able to get his four years done
in high school. He did finish on time and he was a good student,''
Mrs. Shoreys said. ``He had a lousy body, but a really good mind.''
   ``I'm glad that we got 18 years,'' said his sister, Michelle.
``We were happy about (the graduation). Unfortunately, we weren't
able to see him walk down the aisle.''
   The flag at Doherty High School was at half-staff Wednesday. Two
days earlier, Principal Pasquale Quitadamo had expected to hand
Shoreys his diploma.
   The principal said few in the audience realized why Shoreys
didn't show up. ``He was a fighter. He tried his best,'' the
principal said. ``If this was what was meant to be, he certainly had
to be happy about completing his four years.''
   Mrs. Shoreys said her son opened his graduation presents Monday
night. At about 2 a.m. Tuesday, ``He called me and I went in and he
died,'' she said.
   Born with a congenital heart defect that also affected his lungs,
Shoreys had been on a waiting list for a heart-lung transplant, said
his physician, Dr. Allan Goldblatt.
   ``If there's some sense to his tragic death, it is to bring to
the people of this country an understanding that there must be so
many Aaron Shoreys who are missing out on the opportunity for a
potential future and that opportunity is not going to be available
without more organ donors,'' Goldblatt said.
   Mrs. Shoreys said she and her husband, Peter, agreed to donate
any of their son's usable organs. His corneas have been
transplanted, she said.
   ``It would make Aaron very happy,'' she said.

   The Census has counted 91 percent of American
households, the bureau reported today.
   The national head count is now entering the home stretch, said
bureau director Barbara Bryant.
   Census takers are still going door-to-door seeking those people
who have not yet been counted.
   The effort is expected to continue at least through the end of
June and mop-up activities are likely to continue through August.
   The first official report on the nation's population is due Dec.
31.
   The census is mandated by the Constitution every 10 years. The
numbers are used to reapportion seats in Congress and to distribute
billions of dollars in federal money.
   Here is a state-by-state list of the percentage of households
that have been counted:

<HEAD>Summit Meeting Most Closely Followed News of Month</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's summit meeting with Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev was the most closely followed news story
of the month, but not among Americans under 30, the Times Mirror
Center for People &amp; the Press reported today.
   The center, which makes monthly studies of how much attention
people pay to events in the news, said the Bush-Gorbachev summit was
followed ``very closely'' by 38 percent of the American people,
making it the top story among those included in the survey.
   Among persons under age 30, however, only 26 percent paid
particular attention to the summit news. The favored story among
that group was the flooding in Texas and other Southwestern states,
which was followed ``very closely'' by 29 percent.
   In the overall ratings, the Washington summit far outdrew the
Bush-Gorbachev meeting off the coast of Malta in December, which was
followed very closely by 21 percent.
   The Washington summit drew very close attention from 35 percent
of people aged 30 to 49. Among those 50 and older, it held the
attention of 49 percent.
   Overall, 34 percent said they followed the Southwestern floods
very closely, putting it second to the summit in news interest.
   Next came the tensions between Moscow and the Baltic republics,
at 21 percent; news of the budget summit and the savings and loan
scandal, each at 18 percent; racial tensions in New York City, 17
percent; renewed Palestinian rioting, 11 percent; and the elections
in Romania, 6 percent.
   The survey results are based on telephone interviews conducted
under the direction of Princeton Survey Research Associates among
1,231 adults from June 1-4. Times Mirror said the results are
subject to an error of plus or minus 3 percentage points because of
sampling and other random effects.
   The center is a research arm of Times Mirror, which publishes the
Los Angeles Times and other newspapers and has other publishing and
broadcasting interests.

   Thousands of people armed with spears, stones and
guns are massing along the border between the Central Asian
republics of Kirghizia and Uzbekistan, seeking to avenge the 48
people who have died in ethnic warfare, a top Soviet official said
today.
   Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin told lawmakers in Moscow that the
violence, which began three days ago in one town in Kirghizia, had
spilled over to Uzbekistan and spread to five regions in Kirghizia.
   A state of emergency was declared today in Frunze, the capital of
Kirghizia, where one person died from a beating, cars were destroyed
and thousands of people surrounded Communist Party and government
buildings, an official said. They demanded the resignation of the
republic's leaders and urged Kirghiz to unite and strike back at
Uzbeks, the Tass news agency said. ``Kirghiz, unite!'' and ``Kirghiz
to Osh!'' they chanted, referring to the frontier town 195 miles to
the south, where the fighting flared Monday over a land dispute,
Tass reported.
   The unrest has been the latest in a series of ethnic outbreaks
fueled by poverty or political conflict that have occurred in the
more permissive political climate of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's 5-year tenure.
   The conflicts, especially a bitter feud between Armenia and
Azerbaijan in the Caucusus, have claimed hundreds of lives and
forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes in the face
of attacks by rival ethnic groups.
   An estimated 2,000 Uzbeks tried to cross the border from their
republic to fight in Osh, but security forces stopped them and
sealed all roads between Uzbekistan and Kirghizia, the unofficial
Interfax news agency reported.
   A state of emergency and curfew are in effect in Osh, with troops
patrolling the streets and sealing off the city.
   Overnight in Frunze, security forces fired warning shots to
disperse groups of students who ``committed acts of hooliganism,''
damaging a children's hospital, a cloth factory and a market, Tass
reported.
   A state of emergency and curfew were declared in Frunze, where
more than 4,000 angry students rallied in the center of the city and
demanded a chance to fight Uzbeks, said Ivan V. Pavlov, a department
head on the city's party executive committee.
   Participants at the rally also gave leaders of the republic three
days to resign, Tass said. Militia units held back the crowds.
   A shopkeeper from the bazaar died today from a beating he
received the day before, said Pavlov, the city party official. He
said no further deaths were reported today but that angry crowds had
destroyed 34 cars and several buses.
   Bakatin, the top Soviet law enforcement official, told parliament
that thousands of ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks were ``standing at the
ready, striving to avenge wrongdoings.'' He said violence had been
reported in Uzbekistan and had spread to five regions in Kirghizia,
but he did not identify the sites.
   Bakatin said the ``local clashes may develop into conflict
between the two republics,'' Tass said.
   ``The militia cannot handle inter-ethnic conflicts, particularly
in the kindling of cave-dwelling and medieval nationalism,'' Bakatin
said in a speech to the Soviet of Nationalities, one of two houses
of the Soviet parliament.
   Tass's English-language service left out Bakatin's reference to
``cave-dwelling and medieval,'' which were carried on its Russian
wires.
   The Uzbeks and the Kirghiz are predominantly Sunni Moslem ethnic
groups that speak different Turkic dialects.
   Soviet Central Asia, with high levels of poverty and
unemployment, has been hit repeatedly by violence since Gorbachev
began to relax central controls. The country's worsening economic
crisis has hit the region particularly hard.
   In the fighting at Osh since Saturday, 48 people have been
killed, 11 of them in the previous 24 hours, and 333 injured,
including 42 ``law and order personnel'' _ 39 militiamen and three
soldiers, Bakatin said.
   Security forces ``stood between the warring bands of Kirghiz and
Uzbeks,'' said Bakatin, adding that 1,500 regular army soldiers, 900
Interior Ministry militia and troops, and 450 troops under the KGB
border guard were trying to keep order in Osh.
   The fighting was triggered by the distribution of land for
individual houses in Osh, a heavily populated area along the
twisting border between Uzbekistan and Kirghizia, Bakatin said.
   He blamed the dispute on ``folly, self-conceit and a bureaucratic
approach to the division of land where the interests of one
nationality were ignored,'' but gave no further details.
   The area is closed to Western correspondents and official
accounts of the unrest and the death toll have been sketchy.

<HEAD>Pay Phones Take Technical Step Back To Combat Drug Deals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pay phones in an inner-city park are going
low-tech to combat drug dealers who rely on push-button models.
   Modern telephones in MacArthur Park will be replaced with rotary
dial phones under a City Council plan adopted unanimously Wednesday.
The older style phones cannot activate most pagers used by the
dealers.
   Similar steps were taken in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in
April.
   The Police Department was charged with overseeing the plan that
includes asking pay telephone companies to install lighting and bar
incoming calls at phones in high-crime areas.
   Drug dealers like beepers because they can be used on the street
and because some fear telephone taps, police say.
   Customers call dealers and can leave phone numbers anonymously.
Dealers often send suppliers numbers of the pay phones where they
are or use pre-arranged number codes to set up drug deliveries.
   MacArthur Park is a sprawling landmark west of downtown where
tourists can rent paddle boats. In recent years, it has attracted
homeless people and the dealers.
   Representatives of Pacific Bell and Pacific Coin have pledged
cooperation in the effort to disconnect drug dealers.

<HEAD>New Cabinet Will Take Tougher Measures Against Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has agreed to take
tougher measures against the Palestinian uprising in an effort to
draw key far-right factions into a coalition government, a
right-wing party official said today.
   Shamir, who heads the right-wing Likud bloc, also has promised
his new coalition would allocate more money for enlarging the Jewish
settlements in the occupied lands, the daily Maariv reported.
   The reports came amid feverish attempts by Likud to overcome
feuds among eight potential coalition partners by a deadline of
Friday, when Shamir's mandate to form a government expires.
   Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, declined to comment on the
reports of tougher steps against the uprising or more money for
settlements.
   ``When we announce the government tomorrow, we will aso announce
the policy guidelines,'' he said.
   Pazner described Shamir as being close to forming a right-wing
coalition. The prime minister's confidence was bolstered today when
Labor member Efraim Gur announced he would defect to the Likud.
   That would give Shamir 62 votes, if he gets all eight religious
and right-wing parties. If he fails to form a government, Israel
could be forced to hold early national elections.
   Ultra-Orthodox religious parties that would be key to forming the
Cabinet reportedly were demanding more government jobs before
agreeing to back a Likud-led coalition.
   The uncertainty prompted President Chaim Herzog to intervene
Wednesday and ask Shamir and Shimon Peres, leader of the
left-of-center Labor Party, to meet and consider building another
joint coalition like the one that collapsed March 15. By this
morning Peres had agreed to the meeting but Shamir failed to
respond, said Herzog's spokesman, Giora Pordes.
   Israel Television said Herzog's call for another unity coalition
had been prompted by a flood of letters he received in the last week
from Israeli citizens worried about the continuing political void.
   The collapse of the government in March came in a parliamentary
vote of no confidence after Likud refused to go along with Labor
demands that Israel agree to a U.S.-proposed first meeting with
Palestinian representatives.
   Peres then failed in a 35-day bid to form a left-leaning
coalition. Herzog subsequently gave Shamir a mandate to try on April
27. His time runs out on Friday evening.
   Danny Dayan, secretary-general of the far-right Tehiya Party,
said that to meet the deadline, Shamir agreed to hard-line action
against the intefadeh, the 30-month-old Palestinian uprising, and to
steps to increase the population of the 130 Jewish settlements in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Dayan denied there was an agreement on giving more money to
settlements. But he said his party would insist on that once a
government was installed.
   Dayan, reached by telephone, also said ``the policy guidelines
will say that measures will be taken to end the intefadeh,'' but
that the agreement did not detail what measures were involved.
   Untra-right leaders have been demanding such steps as expelling
Arab stone-throwers from the occupied territories and destroying
more homes of terror suspects.
   Such steps could further strain ties with the United States,
which already has complained about the harsh moves taken by Israel
to put down the revolt against occupation.

<HEAD>Major Developments During the 1986-90 National State of Emergency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a list of the major
political developments in South Africa during the 4-year-old state
of emergency that was lifted in three of the country's four
provinces Thursday:
   _June 12, 1986: President P.W. Botha imposes the emergency amid
growing black unrest that has left hundreds dead. Thousands of
activists are detained without trial within days. The African
National Congress begins an urban bombing campaign.
   _July 1, 1986: The government repeals the Pass Laws, which
required blacks to have an identity document and permission to be in
white areas.
   _Nov. 5, 1987: The government frees African National Congress
leader Govan Mbeki after 23 years in prison. The government says his
release is trial run for the freeing of other anti-apartheid leaders
such as Nelson Mandela. One month later the government places tight
restrictions on the 77-year-old Mbeki.
   _Feb. 24, 1988: The government effectively bans 17 opposition
groups, including the United Democratic Front, the largest legal
anti-apartheid organization at the time.
   _January 1989: Some 1,000 detainees go on a hunger strike
demanding to be put on trial or released. Hundreds are released over
a period of several weeks.
   _Jan. 18, 1989: Botha suffers a stroke. He returns to work
several weeks later, but gives up his post as leader of the
governing National Party. F.W. de Klerk becomes party leader and
heir apparent to Botha.
   _July 5, 1989: Botha meets with Mandela, the jailed African
National Congress leader, for a brief talk.
   _Aug. 14, 1989: After disputes with his Cabinet, Botha resigns.
De Klerk assumes power.
   _Sept. 6, 1989: De Klerk's National Party wins white
parliamentary elections. Some 20 blacks are killed in clashes with
security forces the same day. De Klerk launches a series of reforms
such as allowing peaceful demonstrations and opening segregated
beaches to all races.
   _Oct. 15, 1989: Six African National Congress leaders imprisoned
for more than 25 years, including Walter Sisulu, are released. Two
weeks later, the first legal ANC rally in 30 years draws 70,000
blacks in the Soweto township outside Johannesburg.
   _Feb. 2, 1990: De Klerk legalizes the ANC and more than 60
additional opposition groups, suspends the death penalty, eases
emergency restrictions, announces Mandela will be released shortly.
   _Feb. 11: Mandela is freed after more than 27 years in prison,
receives tumultuous welcomes in rallies in the country's major
cities.
   _May 2-4: The ANC and the government hold their first talks. They
agree to work together to end violence and negotiate a new
constitution that would end white domination and bring blacks into
the national government.
   _June 7: President F.W. de Klerk ends the national state of
emergency, but keeps emergency rules in effect in violence-torn
Natal province.

<HEAD>Engineer Leaves Engine Running, Train Taken on 2-Mile Joyride</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A train engineer figured it was safe to leave
his engine running while stopped in a railyard, but returned to find
empty tracks. Someone took the train on a two-mile joyride.
   The ride ended when the train ran out of track Wednesday. The
culprit escaped; no injuries or damage were reported.
   Engineer C.L. Keibaugh left the CSX freight train engine running,
but hid controls needed to get it going again, police said. The
train-taker apparently found the controls.
   ``I imagine whoever left it felt it was perfectly secure,'' said
county police Sgt. Daniel Nowack.
   The train never got going very fast and came to rest when track
ran out, with the engine's two front wheels coming to rest in
gravel, he said.
   Whoever rolled off with the train jumped off somewhere along the
line, police said.
   Andrea Just, a CSX spokeswoman, said she was unaware of any
company policies prohibiting crews from leaving trains in rail yards
with the engines running.
   ``I think it's more a matter of common sense prevailing,'' she
said.
   The engine and cars were valued in police reports at $2 million,
but most were empty, Nowack said.

   Manuel H. Johnson, who as vice chairman of the
Federal Reserve helped steer the nation's monetary policy for the
past 3{ years, announced his resignation today to return to academic
life.
   Johnson, 41, was appointed to the Fed by President Reagan on Feb.
7, 1986, and became vice chairman on Aug. 4 of that year. He said
his resignation would be effective Aug. 3 at the end of his term as
vice chairman. His term on the central bank would have ended Aug.
21, 2000.
   There was no immediate comment from the White House on a
successor.
   As Fed vice chairman, Johnson helped steer monetary policy
through the last half of the nation's longest peacetime economic
expansion.
   For more than a year, the central bank has sought to stem
inflation by keeping a tight grip on credit without tipping the
economy into a recession. The result _ continued, but slow economic
growth _ has become known as the ``soft landing.''
   ``I am extremely proud to have played a part in the unprecedented
period of sustained economic growth and low inflation that has
characterized the decade of the 1980s and continues into the
1990s,'' Johnson said in his letter of resignation to President Bush.
   ``Although there are still major issues to be addressed as this
country moves ahead, I feel optimistic about our future. Indeed,
part of my reasoning for leaving at this time is the confidence I
have in my colleagues at the Federal Reserve and in the economic
team you have assembled in your administration,'' he continued.
   Johnson said he plans to return to George Mason University in
Washington's Virginia suburbs and assume the Koch Chair in
international economics and become director of the Center for Global
Market Studies.
   ``I deeply regret, but understand, Manley Johnson's decision,''
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said in a statement. ``The vice chairman
and I have been an effective team. I'll miss him.''
   The Fed is the nation's central bank whose primary responsibility
is monetary policy. Its Federal Open Market Committee actually makes
the key decisions affecting the cost and availability of money and
credit.
   The Fed is run by a seven-member board of governors,
headquartered in Washington, and a nationwide network of 12 district
banks. The governors are appointed by the president and confirmed by
the Senate to serve 14-year terms.
   The newest member, former assistant Treasury secretary David
Mullins, was confirmed by the Senate last month, bringing the board
to full strength.
   Johnson, 41, served as an assistant secretary and deputy
assistant secretary of the Treasury prior to his Fed appointment. As
a Treasury official, Johnson was responsible for formulating
economic policy initiatives and developing the administration's
economic forecast for the budget.
   He also was instrumental in designing the Economic Recovery Tax
Act of 1981 and the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
   Born in Troy, Ala., Johnson was a graduate of Troy State
University and received masters and doctoral degrees in economics
from Florida State University.
   From 1977 to 1981, Johnson taught graduate economics at George
Mason University in suburban Fairfax, Va., where he holds a full
professorship. He and his wife have two children.

<HEAD>Blood Demand Falls During 1980s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. doctors cut back their use of donated blood
for transfusions during the 1980s, apparently because of fear of
passing on AIDS, according to a study released today.
   The study found that transfusions of whole blood and red cells
totaled 9.9 million pints in 1980, reached a peak of 12.2 million
pints in 1986 and have declined since then. During the same period,
people have sharply increased the practice of setting aside their
own blood for use during operations.
   The study, directed by Dr. Douglas M. Surgenor of the Center for
Blood Research in Boston, was based on a survey of about 5,800
hospitals and blood centers. It was published in today's issue of
the New England Journal of Medicine.
   Among the findings:
   _Transfusions of whole blood and red cells fell to 11.6 million
pints in 1987 and continued to decline in 1988, the last year of the
survey.
   _Transfusions of blood plasma dropped almost 9 percent during the
decade.
   _Donations of autologous blood _ the practice of setting aside
blood for one's own use _ increased from 30,000 pints in 1982 to
397,000 pints in 1987.
   _The supply of blood donated for others was unchanged between
1986 and 1988.
   The researchers attributed the changes to fear of passing on the
AIDS virus through transfusions. The chance of catching the disease
from a transfusion has been slight since blood banks began screening
for the virus in 1985.

<TEXT>
   Fire heavily damaged a guest bedroom
today in the 118-room Mar-a-Lago mansion owned by real estate tycoon
Donald Trump in this tony resort town, the fire chief said.
   A member of the household staff called the 911 emergency line at
8:08 a.m. to report the fire in a two-story guest wing attached to
the main building at the historic oceanfront estate, said Fire Chief
Ken Elmore.
   About 15 firefighters put the fire out in about 15 minutes,
before flames could spread beyond the bedroom and attached bathroom,
Elmore said. No one was injured.
   The fire caused no structural damage, but smoke spread to several
other bedrooms in the wing, Elmore said. He had no estimate of the
dollar loss.
   Elmore said he didn't know whether any Trumps were home, but said
no one had been staying in the guest bedroom.
   ``The cause of the fire is undetermined,'' he said. ``We don't
have any reason to believe that it's suspicious at this time.''
   The 58-bedroom mansion is located on a 17-acre strip of land
between the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway.
   Trump bought the 64-year-old Mar-a-Lago, Spanish for sea to lake,
in 1985 for $7 million. The coral-colored home is one of about 130
in this island community bearing a historical designation.

   Thousands of students rallied in front of
Parliament today, and workers blocked a main street leading to the
city as East German lawmakers debated ways to head off widespread
unemployment.
   University students demanded that the stipends they receive for
attending school be increased as the nation merges its economy with
West Germany's as part of the process of German unification.
   The group marched around the Parliament building and staged a
sit-in at its entrance, but there were no major incidents.
   Education Minister Hans Joachim Meyer came outside to speak to
the group of several thousands students and said the government
would consider their demands.
   But he also referred to East Germany's ``difficult financial
situation.''
   About 10 students got inside the Parliament building while
lawmakers were meeting, unfurled a banner from the spectator gallery
and threw leaflets to the floor below. They were led away without
incident.
   About 3,000 students and teachers in the southern city of
Chemnitz also staged a demonstration, the government news agency ADN
said.
   The broad agreement merging the German economies and social
institutions contains no details about the stipends that students
received for attending school.
   Meanwhile, electronics industry workers from the outlying city of
Teltow blocked for about an hour a main thoroughfare connecting
Berlin with the city of Potsdam, ADN said.
   The workers were demanding protection from unemployment. The
electronics industry is expected to be among those that suffer the
most from competition from the West.
   Many East Germans already are buying radios and other
sophisiticated electronics appliances from Western manufacturers.
   Experts estimate that up to 4 million East Germans may lose their
jobs as the nation's industries are forced to compete with more
efficient Western companies.
   Lawmakers debated measures to ease the transition to a free
market, including a government plan to set up retraining centers for
workers likely to lose their jobs.
   Economics Minister Gerhard Pohl said the government will discuss
the possibility of closing down large sections of industies to
conduct massive retraining programs.
   But he said this would be done against the backdrop of the
``hopeless situation'' in the microelectronics, auto, and shoe
industries in the industrial cities of the South, where many giant,
outmoded industries are expected to fail.
   In the West German capital, Bonn, an opposition lawmaker warned
of serious problems this autumn with East Germany's system of
vocational and technical schools.
   Social Democrat Gert Weisskirchen said industries in East Germany
may have to cancel between 20,000 and 30,000 training contracts for
students being groomed for skilled jobs in factories.
   He said up to 60,000 students may not be able to find work in
their fields after their training is complete this year.

   Jesse Jackson is injecting himself into Mayor
Marion Barry's battle over drug charges, saying prosecutors should
revive plea bargain talks to ``spare all of us the pain'' of a
racially divisive trial.
   Barry is ``open to a negotiated process,'' Jackson said. He urged
Barry to promise he won't seek re-election and urged prosecutors to
spare the mayor a prison sentence.
   Talk of a possible plea bargain dominated public discussion of
Barry's cocaine and perjury trial as the process of selecting a jury
went into a fourth day today. Sixteen people were added Wednesday to
bring the jury pool to 25. Four more prospective jurors were
questioned this morning.
   The mayor and prosecutors are at an impasse over the
prosecution's insistence that he plead guilty to one of the three
felony charges against him, said a source close to the Barry camp
who insisted on anonymity.
   If he pleaded guilty to a felony, Barry might face prison and
would have to resign his office.
   ``The mayor obviously does not want to resign. The mayor
obviously does not want to go to jail,'' Jackson said in an
interview.
   Various reports have said Barry may be willing to plead guilty to
misdemeanor drug possession charges if he could finish out the last
few months of his term.
   But Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, told reporters during a
break in Wednesday's court proceedings: ``Are there talks ongoing
now? No.''
   Mundy disclosed he had spoken with Jackson about the trial, but
wouldn't comment on those discussions.
   Jackson and Walter Fauntroy, the District of Columbia's delegate
to Congress, apparently had not succeeded in persuading prosecutors
to reopen plea bargain talks.
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said Tuesday it would be inappropriate
to meet with a third party on a criminal matter and had no comment
on Jackson's latest remarks.
   Sources close to the prosecution, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said it would be extremely unlikely that Stephens would
meet with Jackson.
   Barry is facing three felony charges of perjury, 10 misdemeanor
cocaine possession charges and one count of conspiracy. He's accused
of smoking crack cocaine in an FBI sting Jan. 18 and possessing
cocaine at other times and lying about it to a federal grand jury.
   Fauntroy, himself a mayoral candidate, called a news conference
to remind reporters he had earlier appealed to Barry and prosecutors
to ``spare the city and the nation the agony of a trial.''
   Jackson, who until now has not spoken extensively about the drug
charges, urged Barry to declare he won't run again and prosecutors
to seek a settlement.
   ``I would hope that both of them could work out an agreement
honorably and within the law short of a full-blown, long, nasty,
divisive trial, to spare all of us that pain,'' Jackson said.
   In a separate television interview, Jackson said the debate over
Barry's troubles has become ``very Republican-Democrat, very
black-white; it's very nasty.''
   ``I would hope that the mayor would determine he would not run
again ... and would really challenge the Justice Department to work
out some settlement process,'' he told WUSA-TV.
   Most of the 16 jurors added to the pool Wednesday said they were
somewhat familiar with the case. They included one man who worried
his family could face threats if his name was made public and a
woman who said race ``had a lot to do with'' the investigation of
the black mayor.

   A man shot in the back during a pellet-gun
shooting spree says his attackers would have faced harsher penalties
if they lived by frontier rules.
   ``In the old days, in the West, people like you would have been
hung,'' Clyde Lehman said Wednesday in a face-to-face meeting with
his attackers called by Judge John Bozza.
   Four men pleaded guilty in the string of drive-by shootings with
pellet guns that wounded 19 people last year.
   Kevin Trost, 19; Thomas K. Craig, 19; and Mark Smith, 20; face a
maximum 112 years in prison at their sentencing Friday.
   William Peyton, 18, faces a 30-year term in connection with one
shooting. He will be sentenced later this month.
   The judge called victims and the four men together to hear from
both sides before determining the attackers' sentences. Three
apologized and asked for mercy, but Peyton remained silent.
   One of the attackers said the shootings were ``a prank that went
too far.''
   Victim Frank Polenta said the four couldn't be charged with
discrimination.
   ``You shot at men and women, young and old, black and white. You
hit all neighborhoods,'' he said. ``You caused needless and
senseless pain, not only to your victims but to your parents.''
   Helen Howell said her hand swelled to twice its normal size after
the drive-by shooting and told the judge how her wedding band had to
be cut from her finger in a hospital emergency room.
   ``What you did changed my life emotionally and physically,'' she
told her attacker. ``I'm sorry for your parents and your teachers,
but I'm not sorry for you.''

   An oil tanker ran aground in a waterway
between New York and New Jersey early today, rupturing its hull and
leaking about 260,000 gallons of heavy oil into the shipping
channel, the Coast Guard said.
   The waterway was closed to marine traffic and oil was washing
ashore.
   The 811-foot tanker Nautilus ran aground at about 5:15 a.m. and
began leaking No. 6 heating oil into the Kill Van Kull waterway,
said Petty Officer Jim McGranachan.
   Oil was pumped out of the leaking tank, and the leak stopped by
midmorning when the remaining oil fell below the rupture, said Lt.
Cmdr. Paul A. Milligan.
   Officials said they didn't know how much oil was aboard the
tanker, which is owned by the British Nautilus Motor Tanker Co. of
London. The ruptured tank has a capacity of 1.2 million gallons.
   Absorbent booms were set out to contain the spill and other
cleanup crews were called in, McGranachan said.
   The Kill Van Kull and the Arthur Kill, a second shipping channel
between New Jersey and Staten Island, N.Y., have been the scenes of
several major oil spills this year.
   On Jan. 1-2, 567,000 gallons of oil leaked into the Arthur Kill
from a ruptured Exxon underwater pipeline.
   On Feb. 28, 30,000 gallons of heating oil spilled into the Kill
Van Kull from a barge anchored in Bayonne. A day later, nearly 4,000
gallons of heavy crude oil spilled into the Arthur Kill at Exxon's
refinery in Linden.
   About a week later, more than 100,000 gallons of heating oil was
dumped in the Arthur Kill near Linden from a barge that exploded and
caught fire.

   A mentally disabled man was seriously
injured when pranksters paid him a few dollars to do push-ups in the
middle of a street and a car struck him, police said.
   The Erie County district attorney's office was determining
whether it could file charges against the pranksters, said Sheriff
Thomas F. Higgins, uncle of the victim, Michael Gilliland.
   Gilliland, 29, suffered two broken legs, a collapsed lung,
serious head injuries and a possibly ruptured spleen, said his
mother, Joan Archer. He may be hospitalized up to six months as a
result of Sunday's accident, she said.
   ``It just shocks me. He would never do this to himself,'' Mrs.
Archer said. ``He's the most likable person, and he's very naive and
gullible, and he takes everything in good faith.''
   Higgins said the pranksters, whose names have not been released,
had been taunting Gilliland.
   ``They just mocked him and made a fool out of him,'' the sheriff
said. ``Those two individuals have to be the two biggest lowlifes.
They didn't even warn him. They must have seen the car coming.''

   Acts of violence, vandalism and harassment
against gay people were widespread again last year, but new
anti-hate-crime laws offer hope the trend can be reversed, according
to a report released today.
   The report was presented at a news conference by the National Gay
&amp; Lesbian Task Force, along with civil rights, law enforcement and
congressional leaders.
   ``Hate crimes exist because the narrow-minded and mean-spirited
among us have judged some of their fellow citizens to be less
deserving of respect than themselves,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif. ``The more that we bring these crimes to light, the less
tolerable they will be.''
   The fifth annual survey of anti-gay violence in the United
States, recounts 7,031 such incidents in 1989. They ranged from
verbal harassment to homicide, and were documented by 119
organizations and individuals in 40 states and the District of
Columbia.
   ``Last year, the nation's lesbian and gay community celebrated
the 20th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, which sparked the
modern gay rights movement,'' said Kevin Berrill, author of the
report. ``Although we have made remarkable strides toward freedom
since Stonewall, we remain a community under siege, battling an
epidemic of bigotry and violence.''
   In June 1968, patrons rioted at the Stonewall, a gay bar in New
York's Greenwich Village, when police tried to raid it.
   The data for the survey came from questionnaires sent to 650 gay
activists and organizations nationwide. The task force acknowledged
its methods were unscientific, and noted that more than half the
groups that responded in 1988 did not do so in 1989. However, the
survey gives a broad look at the prevalence of anti-gay harassment
and violence.
   Of the total incidents reported last year, approximately
two-thirds, were acts of verbal harassment, the report said. Of the
remaining 2,322 incidents, 34 percent were physical assaults; 31
percent were threats of violence; 17 percent were acts of vandalism;
14 percent were police abuse; 3 percent were homicides; and 1
percent were arson or other victimization.
   Nineteen percent occurred on college campuses, revealing
``dangerous intolerance and prejudice that threatens an academic
environment of enlightenment,'' Berrill said.
   Fifteen percent were classified by local groups as AIDS-related,
indicating that some people continue to use the disease as a
justification for anti-gay prejudice and violence, the report said.
   But the report pointed to laws passed in 1989 and 1990 aimed at
curbing bias crimes, including those against gay people.
   On April 23, 1990, President Bush signed the Hate Crimes
Statistics Act, which requires the federal government to collect
data on crimes based on race, religion, sexual orientation and
ethnicity. The report called this ``an historic victory for the
nation's gay and lesbian community.''
   Hate crimes laws with anti-gay provisions also recently passed
in: California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Iowa,
Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oregon, Vermont, Atlanta, Burlington,
Iowa; Montgomery County, Md.; and St. Louis, according to the report.
   For the most part, states reporting the highest number of
anti-gay incidents were those without hate crime laws that included
homosexuals, the report found.
   States with the highest number of documented episodes were: North
Carolina, 1,204; Texas, 997; California, 563; Illinois, 529; and
Ohio, 387.
   Overall, 1989's total of 7,031 episodes is slightly lower than
the 7,248 reported in 1988, the report noted.
   It added, however, ``Given the many factors that affect annual
totals and the relatively minor difference between 1989 and 1988
figures, it is not possible to accurately gauge whether the problem
increased or decreased last year.''

<HEAD>Baker Said To Be More Optimistic on Germany Issue</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Baker briefing NATO allies on
Soviet position, Thatcher saying NATO needs new role. No pickup.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has shifted to a more
encouraging stand on NATO membership for a unified Germany, U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III was quoted as telling Western
allies today.
   Baker privately briefed NATO foreign ministers who began a
two-day meeting at this resort on Scotland's rugged west coast. The
ministers are seeking a new strategy for the western military
alliance as the Cold War draws to an end.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said nuclear weapons and U.S.
forces remain essential in Europe. She also told the meeting of the
16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization at a luxury hotel in
Turnberry that the Western military alliance should assume a more
political role.
   The meeting is the third in a series held this spring to try to
map out a new strategy for NATO in an era of reduced East-West
tensions. Leaders of the 16 nations meet in London next month to
formally begin work on NATO's future.
   West Germany is a member of NATO, but East Germany is part of the
crumbling Warsaw Pact led by Moscow. NATO wants the new Central
European state to remain in the Western alliance, but the Kremlin
has balked at the idea.
   U.S. officials said Baker reported on his recent talks with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in the Danish capital,
Copenhagen.
   A senior official of a NATO delegation, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Baker indicated to the allies that ``the Soviets
were much more encouraging than at the summit'' last week in
Washington between Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``They have many concerns, but they are looking at more things to
do'' to make NATO membership for a unified Germany more acceptable,
the official said. ``It's more of a change in spirit.''
   Baker brought with him to the current meeting a Soviet proposal
for an accord that would help ease Moscow's concerns about a unified
Germany belonging to NATO, but he told reporters Wednesday that he
was ``not at liberty to get into the details'' of the Soviet plan.
   Baker and his West German counterpart, Hans-Dietrich Genscher,
were reported to be optimistic that the West would reach agreement
with the Kremlin on the military status of the new German state.
   ``Both indicated optimism ... that the Soviets would ultimately
come along with this,'' said a British official who also requested
anonymity.
   Mrs. Thatcher said NATO ``needs to be more imaginative and work
on a bigger canvas... Politically, NATO no longer has a clear
front-line in Europe.''
   ``With the spread of sophisticated weapons and military
technology to areas like the Middle East, potential threats to NATO
may originate from outside Europe,'' she said, calling for U.S.
forces and nuclear weapons to stay put.
   Mrs. Thatcher reiterated her vision of a ``grand alliance''
across Europe, based on a strengthened role for the 35-nation
East-West Conference on European Security and Cooperation. It
comprises all European nations except Albania, as well as the United
States and Canada.
   ``This is the time to create a new European order, an order for a
Europe which is undivided, free and at peace,'' NATO
Secretary-General Manfred Woerner told the NATO meeting. He said the
alliance must adapt to last year's fall of hard-line Communist
governments in Eastern Europe. ``If we want to be able to meet the
challenge of change, we have to change ourselves,'' he said.
   The Warsaw Pact has been unraveling since the political upheavals
in Eastern Europe. Hungary and Czechoslovakia, once staunch members,
have demanded the removal of Red Army troops from their soil.

<HEAD>Some Changes in Legal Situation With The Lifting of Emergency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Without the national state of
emergency, the government still has wide powers under its security
laws to restrict political activity.
   By using the law and the courts, government ministers and the
police force can take most of the actions which the 4-year-old
emergency regulations allowed. But there are some changes in the
three provinces where President F.W. de Klerk ordered the emergency
ended:
   _People detained without trial, or whose freedom of activity is
restricted, can challenge the action in court. Under the emergency,
judges' discretion was generally limited to determining whether a
particular action was covered by the emergency decree. The decree
said police were empowered to take ``any action'' and to tell anyone
to do anything.
   _Police no longer have automatic immunity from prosecution for
actions they take ``in good faith'' in an unrest situation.
   _The power of the police to conduct warrantless searches and
seizures is reduced but not eliminated.
   _Police commissioners can no longer make sweeping bans on all
rallies, marches or public gatherings in their region. They have to
obtain a magistrate's order to halt specific activities. However,
the minister of law and order still has power under the law to
declare any region an ``unrest area'' and impose emergency
regulations within it.
   _Police lose their power to place restrictions on funerals in
black townships and to prohibit the display of certain slogans.
   _Government ministers can no longer seize newspapers or suspend
them at will. They can still halt newspaper publication, but must go
through legal procedures and their action can be challenged in court.
   _Police cannot order journalists or community workers away from
an unrest area merely by invoking ``emergency regulations.'' They
can still issue such orders but must have a legal reason.

   The superpowers may complete a treaty on 30
percent cuts in long-range nuclear weapons as early as November, a
senior U.S. negotiator said today.
   Linton Brooks, deputy head of the U.S. delegation to the Geneva
negotiations, told reporters he was confident the treaty would be
finished by the end of the year, a target affirmed at last week's
summit by President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``I think it's possible to do it ... as early as sometime in
November,'' Brooks said.
   The three major areas of disagreement are on limits to Soviet
modernization of the SS-18 ballistic missile, constraints on the
Soviet Backfire bomber and ways of limiting sales of long-range
missiles to third countries.
   Brooks said the negotiators, who return to the bargaining table
in Geneva on Monday, also have a lot of work left on details of an
inspection regime for the treaty.
   Even as the superpowers are approaching the end of eight years of
negotiations on this landmark treaty, some critics are saying the
U.S.-Soviet approach to reducing offensive nuclear weapons is
becoming outdated.
   On Wednesday, U.S. and Soviet scientists released a jointly
published book that said future nuclear arms accords should provide
for the destruction of warheads, not just the missiles or other
vehicles that deliver them.
   The book, ``Reversing the Arms Race,'' by the Federation of
American Scientists and the Committee of Soviet Scientists for
Global Security, also said the superpowers could cut the number of
strategic nuclear weapons to less than 2,000 on each side without
creating an incentive to launch a preemptive first strike.
   The U.S.-Soviet treaty nearing completion at the Strategic Arms
Reduction Talks in Geneva calls for a 30 percent reduction in
strategic, or long-range, nuclear weapons, to 6,000 on each side.
   The START treaty as drafted would not require the elimination of
any warheads, nor was there any such requirement in the 1987
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty that banned all U.S. and
Soviet land-based missiles of medium range.
   The START and INF treaties require destruction of missiles and
missile launchers, but put no restrictions on removing the
fissionable material from the warheads and reusing it in other
weapons not covered by the treaties.
   Allowing warheads from treaty-prohibited weapons to be reused has
not been a major drawback during an era in which both superpowers
have tens of thousands of nuclear weapons, the scientists said. But
it will become a problem in guarding against treaty cheating if
future arms deals cut arsenals to minimal levels.
   The scientist groups also said that for warhead dismantlement to
be effective, the superpowers should agree to halt production of new
fissionable materials, including plutonium, tritium and enriched
uranium, used in warheads.
   Congress is increasingly interested in pursuing a U.S.-Soviet
agreement to halt nuclear materials production, but the Bush
administration is opposed.
   The scientist groups noted that both Moscow and Washington
already have had to reduce their nuclear materials production
because of safety problems in manufacturing. Just this week new
evidence emerged to indicate that problems at a key U.S. weapons
plant are more serious than previously believed.

<HEAD>One of West Germany's Most Wanted Terrorist Suspects is Captured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of West Germany's most wanted terrorist
suspects, linked to the slayings of a prominent banker and a wealthy
industrialist, has been captured, officials said today.
   Susanne Albrecht, 39, a member of the notorious Red Army Faction
terrorist group, was captured Wednesday afternoon in front of her
apartment in East Berlin, East Germany's interior minister said.
   The minister, Peter-Michael Diestel, said Albrecht had been
living in East Berlin for the past 10 years under an assumed name
and was married to an East German.
   Albrecht is accused of killing Juergen Ponto, former head of West
Germany's Dresdner Bank, outside his home in July 1977 in the West
German city of Oberursel, just north of Frankfurt. Albrecht was an
acquaintance of the Ponto family.
   She is also wanted in connection with the kidnapping and killing
of West German industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer.
   Schleyer, the president of West Germany's Employers and Trade
Association, was kidnapped on Sept. 5 1977, when two of his
bodyguards were cut down in a hail of bullets on a Cologne street.
   He was held by the Red Army Faction for six weeks before being
slain.
   The Red Army Faction, a spinoff of the Baader-Meinhof gang, got
its start with a series of arson and bombing attacks, mainly against
U.S. military targets, in what it said was retaliation for the war
in Vietnam.
   It later broadened its attacks, staging bombings and slayings of
West German industrial and banking leaders.
   About 25 Red Army Faction members are still being sought. The
West German Interior Ministry says there are also about 250
sympathizers who provide hideouts and other support for gang members.
   The latest attack claimed by the Red Army Faction was bombing
death of banker Alfred Herrhausen on Nov. 30. Herrhausen, 59, was
head of Deutsche Bank, West Germany's largest commercial bank. He
was killed when a bomb was detonated under his armored car as he was
being driven to work from his home in Bad Homburg, 12 miles north of
Frankfurt.
   In October 1977, a group of Palestinian terrorists hijacked a
Lufthansa plane to Mogadishu, Somalia, and demanded the release of
jailed terrorists belonging to the Baader-Meinhof group.
   The hijackers were overpowered by a West German anti-terrorist
unit on Oct. 18, 1977, after the plane landed in Mogadishu.
   The pilot of the plane was shot and killed, but 89 passengers and
crew were freed safely. Of the terrorists, four were shot and killed
and a fifth terrorist was wounded.
   A Palestinian, Soraya Ansari, was later tried and sentenced to 20
years in prison.
   Hours after the raid on the plane, convicted terrorists Andreas
Baader, Gudrin Ensslin and Jan-Carl Raspe were found shot to death
in their prison cells in Stammheim prison in Stuttgart. Officials
said they had committed suicide.
   Schleyer was found shot to death in the trunk of a car in
Mulhausen, France, near the border with West Germany, a short time
later.
   Ulrike Meinhof, who along with Andreas Baader led the
Baader-Meinhof gang of the late 1960s, had hanged herself a year
earlier in prison.

<HEAD>Michigan Census Takers Take a Hike Over Pay Dispute</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   On-schedule census workers staged a
sickout today to protest a $2-an-hour raise given to census takers
in other parts of the country where the head count is lagging.
   Seventy-five of about 100 day-shift office workers called in sick
with the flu, but most said they will be better by Friday, said
Arlin Violetta, district census manager.
   ``They're calling it the $2-bill blue flu,'' he said. The sickout
affected only Michigan's Upper Peninsula, where the census count is
on schedule.
   ``I'm sure it was in protest to wage increases across the country
that we did not get,'' Violetta said. ``I think it's just showing a
point that if you're doing a rotten job with the census, you'll get
a raise. If you do a good job, you get a slap in the face.''
   Many of the office workers who called in sick earn $4.50 an hour,
compared with clerks in some districts who earn $7 an hour.
   Violetta said the raises went only to field workers. Though
office workers were not affected, the ones in the Upper Peninsula
decided to protest anyway.
   The raises went to regions that are farthest behind in taking the
national population count, where recruiting and retaining workers
has been troublesome.
   ``Our people went in on skis and snowshoes,'' he said. ``We had a
snowstorm May 10, and yet we got our job done.''
   Anger over the raises might prompt some sickout participants to
quit altogether, he said.
   His workers have completed their first door-to-door survey and
were scheduled to begin followup field work within two weeks.
Violetta said he needs to hire 400 new field workers; the sickout
was likely to slow that process.
   ``I feel bad for my people and I'll stand behind them to the end.
I don't think they're being treated fairly,'' he said.
   The census bureau on Wednesday announced pay hikes from between
50 cents and $2 an hour in locations where it has had problems
attracting staff.
   Before the pay hikes, census workers were paid between $5 and $8
an hour depending on local wage rates and staff needs.
   The raises went to workers in New York, Boston, Atlanta, the
Washington, D.C., suburbs, Kansas City, San Diego, Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Charlotte, N.C., and Arizona.

   Like other immigrant groups before them,
America's Hispanics are clustering in cities in a few states and
tend to marry one another, a Census Bureau report released Thursday
shows.
   More than 90 percent of the nation's 20 million Hispanics live in
urban areas, and nearly nine of 10 reside in just nine states, the
bureau said.
   The study of the nation's Hispanics found that they seek each
other out to form families. Some 85 percent of Hispanic husbands
married Latino women and 82 percent of Hispanic wives wed Latin men.
   The report, ``The Hispanic Population in the United States,''
found:
   _There were 20,076,000 Hispanics in the United States as of March
1989. That's up 38.9 percent since 1980. In the same period, the

   _About 92 percent of Hispanic households were in urban areas,
compared with 73 percent of non-Hispanics.
   _The poverty rate among Hispanics was 23.7 percent; it was 9.4

   _Only 42 percent of Hispanic households live in homes they own or

   Democrats on the Senate Agriculture Committee
say legislation to halt export of pesticides that can't be sold in
the United States will help American farmers.
   ``By stopping the export of banned and unregistered pesticides,
we will level the playing field for our producers,'' said Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the committee. ``Both domestic and
foreign farmers will be treated the same.''
   The committee inserted the ban Wednesday in its version of the
1990 farm bill, under protest from ranking Republican Sen. Richard
Lugar of Indiana and other GOP members on the committee.
   Lugar said he didn't think the provision belonged in the
legislation that establishes the government's agricultural policy
for the next five years.
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., said the legislation could lead to
loss of jobs at chemical companies that may decide to do their
manufacturing abroad.
   He also said, ``If we phase companies out, it would take other
companies very little time to gear up.''
   Jay Vroom, president of the National Agricultural Chemicals
Association, said his organization would continue to try to get the
committee to change certain provisions of the bill.
   He said proposed restrictions on experimentation with chemicals
would be detrimental to U.S. scientific discovery.
   ``We could be shooting ourselves in the foot,'' Vroom said.
``Some companies will move research plants to Europe where the
likelihood is better of moving products around the world unfettered
during experimentation on crops.''
   He said many of the unregistered chemicals sold abroad that would
be banned from export are awaiting approval by the Environmental
Protection Agency, which has a backlog. Thus, they could eventually
be registered here, he said.
   Other chemicals don't pass the zero tolerance laws in the United
States for residue, but do pass pesticide regulations in other
countries, Vroom said.
   Leahy said that no part of the farm bill generated more mail to
his office than this one.
   ``At a time when we are toughening our standards at home, we need
to do more about imports with hazardous pesticides,'' he said.
``Because the Food and Drug Administration waives through virtually
all imported food without inspection, these chemicals often end up
on America's dinner tables.''
   About 25 percent of the fruits and vegetables consumed in the
United States come from abroad.
   Many of the chemicals that have been banned for health reasons
were quite effective in eliminating pests and increasing crop yields.
   ``Foreign farmers are able to use made-in-the-USA chemicals that
our farmers cannot,'' said Leahy. ``We effectively penalize U.S.
farmers and growers for using safe pesticides and obeying the law.''

   U.S. food processors and processing-equipment
makers took a few steps closer to converting the Soviet Union to the
capitalistic system during a conference this week.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher signed an agreement Wednesday
with the Soviet Union that promises that federal officials will work
with the Soviets to find ways to adapt the U.S. food making and
distribution system to their country.
   Vladilen Nikitin, the Soviet equivalent to the U.S. agriculture
secretary, said the agreement was a small step, ``but everything
starts with a small step.''
   ``For you, it's a key if you want to participate in the
strengthening of our economy,'' he said through an interpreter.
   The pact was signed on the last day of a three-day conference
sponsored by the Food Processing Machinery &amp; Supplies Association
and the National Food Processors Association.
   Mosbacher said the pact was unprecedented and a start toward
expanding trade between the two superpowers.
   ``We are the two largest industrialized nations in the world,''
said Mosbacher. ``We have one-third of the world's GNP (gross
national product). But we do only a tiny fraction of world trade.''
   John Cady, president of the food processors association, said
barriers are beginning to come down, although Americans are
concerned about getting paid for business with the Soviets.
   Soviet currency is of almost no value in the world market,
leaving those companies doing business in the Soviet Union to either
accept products in exchange or wait for long-term gains after the
economy there improves.
   ``We have to understand when companies invest, it's not going to
be a three-year turnaround, but probably eight to 10 years,'' said
Cady.
   He said Nikitin was a powerful official in the Soviet government
and would smooth the way for American business.
   U.S. businessmen at the conference had complained earlier of
complications in dealing with the Soviet bureaucracy.

   Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., wants to put his
agricultural marketing reform legislation into the 1990 farm bill.
   The measure would modify the Agriculture Department's grading
standards of fruit and vegetables by including flavor, sugar content
and nutritional value as grading criteria.
   The current system of some produce relies solely on its exterior
appearance with no regard for the quality of the fruit or vegetable,
Fowler said.
   Sometimes pesticides are used to enhance the looks of produce
when external appearance is irrelevant, such as in fruits or
vegetables used by juice makers.
   ``Both consumers and farmers will benefit from this amendment,''
Fowler said Wednesday. ``Consumers will be eating healthier food
with less pesticides and farmers will be reducing their costs by
spending less money on pesticides.''

   A New York woman's trip to this arts center has
led to the arrest of her church's former treasurer who was accused
of embezzling $267,000 after he vanished eight years ago.
   Clyde Womer, 67, was in Taos County Jail today, awaiting his
return to New York where he faces six counts of grand larceny. Womer
waived extradtion during an appearance Wednesday before Magistrate
Betty Gonzales.
   After Womer disappeared in 1982, $267,000 was discovered missing
from the treasury of Christ Episcopal Church in Suffern, northwest
of New York City.
   Rockland County District Attorney Kenneth Gribetz in New York
said Womer had persuaded members of the church to invest money in
liquid accounts, which he controlled. Womer then looted the church
accounts, depositing the money in his own bank account, Gribetz said.
   Investigators were unable to trace Womer until last month, when a
church member told police she had seen him in a store and spoken to
him in Taos, where she attended a crafts fair.
   The woman said that she did not let on she suspected the man was
Womer, but that he had volunteered he knew people in Rockland County.
   ``The odds of finding him in Taos, New Mexico, are one in a
million or one in a billion,'' said Gribetz.
   Suffern detective Sgt. Leo J. Costa and a priest from the church
identified Womer, who had taken a new name, Gribetz said. Womer was
arrested Monday night.
   ``I didn't steal any money,'' Womer said as he left court.
   ``I didn't know I was a fugitive from justice 'til Monday,'' he
said. ``I didn't know there were warrants for my arrest. I want to
get back to New York as quickly as possible to clear my name.''
   Womer said he changed his name for ``personal reasons.''
   He moved to Taos in 1983 and in 1984 married Betty Sutton, who
manages a J.C. Penney store. He was retired. Gribetz said Womer left
his wife, Harriet, and five children in New York.
   Sutton said Womer told her his former wife had died of cancer.
   ``This is the last thing I would have thought,'' she said. ``You
never think something like this will happen to you.''
   Harriet Womer, according to Costa, lives in Colorado Springs,
Colo., about 200 miles north of Taos. He said she was in the process
of filing papers to declare her husband dead so she could receive
Social Security payments.
   Womer's assets were seized, Gribetz said, adding that he could
not list them.

<HEAD>Year-Old Cease-fire Violated in Sri Lanka</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year-old cease-fire between the
government and Tamil rebels was violated Thursday when insurgents
opened fire on army trucks in the northeast, police and residents
said.
   One corporal was killed and at least 10 soldiers were injured in
the gunfight at Nedunkeri village, about 160 miles northeast of
Colombo, said police in the area.
   At least six rebels were injured when the army returned fire,
according to the officials who were contacted by telephone and spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   It was the most serious confrontation since the Tamil Tigers
accepted a government invitation to start talks and declared a
unilateral cease-fire in May 1989.
   A military commander of the Tamil Tiger rebels said members of
his group opened fire when the army convoy refused to stop at a
checkpoint manned by the rebels.
   Suresh, the commander, said in a telephone interview that the
Tigers did not suffer any casualties. He uses only one name.
   The Tamil Tigers have been at the forefront of the Tamils'
7-year-old war for an independent nation in northern and eastern Sri
Lanka. After last year's cease-fire, they started negotiating with
the government for autonomy in the predominantly Tamil region.
   At least 11,000 people have died in the war, including 1,100
Indian soldiers who were sent to the country to put down the Tamil
rebellion.
   The last Indian soldiers left Sri Lanka in March, and the Tigers
began sharing law and order duties with Sri Lankan soldiers and
policemen.
   But there have been strains in the relationship. Newspapers
accuse the rebels of assaulting policemen, levying illegal taxes and
blocking roads.
   The Tigers say the government has stepped up military movement
and may be gearing up for another bout of fighting.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
claim they are discriminated against by Sinhalese, who form 75
percent of the population and dominate the army and government.

<HEAD>Older Americans More Closely Follow Summit News</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The older you are the more attention you
probably paid to the Bush-Gorbachev summit last week, judging from a
report released Thursday.
   The Times Mirror Center for The People &amp; The Press said President
Bush's meetings with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in
Washington and at Camp David were followed ``very closely'' by 38
percent of Americans. The center makes monthly reports of how
closely people follow news events.
   Among persons under age 30, however, only 26 percent paid
especially close attention to summit news. More younger people _ 29
percent of them _ followed the flooding in Texas and other
Southwestern states very closely.
   The summit drew very close attention from 35 percent of those age
30 to 49. Among those 50 and older, it held the attention of 49
percent.
   Overall, the summit far out drew the Bush-Gorbachev meeting off
the coast of Malta in December, which 21 percent followed very
closely.
   It was the most closely followed story of the month, with the
Southwestern floods in second place at 34 percent.
   Next came the tensions between Moscow and the Soviet Union's
Baltic republics, at 21 percent; news of the budget summit and the
savings and loan scandal, each at 18 percent; racial tensions in New
York City, 17 percent; renewed Palestinian rioting, 11 percent; and
the elections in Romania, 6 percent.
   The survey results are based on telephone interviews with 1,231
adults conducted from June 1-4 under the direction of Princeton
Survey Research Associates. Times Mirror said the results are
subject to an error of plus or minus 3 percent because of sampling
and other random effects.
   The center is a research arm of Times Mirror, which publishes the
Los Angeles Times and other newspapers and has other publishing and
broadcasting interests.

   Unidentified men stabbed an elderly
American to death in his home in the central Philippines, U.S.
officials said Thursday.
   Kathleen Manalo, a spokeswoman for the U.S. consulate office in
Cebu, identified the victim as Joseph Barber, 72, a longtime
resident of the Philippines. Barber was killed June 1 in his home in
Palo, 360 miles southeast of Manila, Ms. Manalo said.
   Ms. Manalo said she received the report on the killing from
military authorities and that there were no further details. Barber
was married to a Filipino.
   It was unknown who may have been behind the slaying of Barber,
the seventh American killed this year in the Philippines.
   One day after Barber's murder, a U.S. sailor was stabbed to death
in an apparent robbery in his home outside the U.S.-run Subic Bay
naval station, northwest of Manila.
   Five other American servicemen and civilians have been killed
this year. Their slayings have been blamed on the communist New
People's Army, which opposes the U.S. military presence in the
Philippines.

   Two American educators, Robert Polhill and Frank Reed, were

   The two worked for the Red Cross orthopedic center in Sidon,
which provided people with artificial limbs.

<TEXT>
   The White House today called the
lifting of the state of emergency in most of South Africa a sign of
``the remarkable progress'' made in recent months in the
white-minority-ruled country.
   It said the move by South African President F.W. de Klerk to lift
the 4-year-old state of emergency removes a major obstacle to talks
with the opposition African National Congress aimed at ending
apartheid.
   ``We look forward to the early beginning of a negotiating
process,'' deputy White House press secretary Alixe Glen told
reporters flying aboard Air Force One with President Bush to a
speaking engagement in Milwaukee.
   ``We welcome the announcement of the ending of the state of
emergency in South Africa, except in Natal. This is another
significant step toward creating a climate conducive to negotiations
that will lead to a democratic, non-racial South Africa,'' she said.
   The announcement ``builds on earlier decisions by President de
Klerk to release Nelson Mandela and certain other political
prisoners, to unban the ANC and other organizations and to permit
free political debate to take place in South Africa,'' she said.
   ``Much work remains to be done by all sides. The issue of the
remaining political prisoners needs to be resolved. The continuing
climate of violence and intimidation must be transformed. The
senseless killings in Natal Province must end.
   ``However, we are encouraged by the remarkable progress that has
been made in recent months. With this latest move, the government
has moved to meet almost all of the opposition's requirements to
enter into negotiations.''
   Mandela, the deputy president of the ANC who was freed from
prison after 27 years last February, is scheduled to visit the White
House on June 25.
   Bush has also invited de Klerk to Washington. He is expected to
come at a later date that has not yet been set.

   Seventy-two times they voted. And 72 times
the result was the same: Frustrated city councilors wound up
deadlocked in their attempt to elect a fellow council member in a
special election.
   Each vote to choose between Selden Hannah and Bernard Veno was
followed by a familiar refrain:
   ``Veno 6, Hannah 6.''
   The councilors tried unsuccessfully into the wee hours Wednesday
to fill a seat vacated by Councilor Ronald Laurion's death.
   Hannah and Veno beat a third candidate in the first vote, but
choosing between the two left the council stymied until the meeting
was recessed at 2 a.m.
   The first portent of problems came when the council decided,
after four fruitless secret ballots, to take care of the rest of the
agenda before picking their new colleague. They returned to the
voting at 11 p.m. Tuesday.
   After the 15th ballot, Councilor Chuck Grassie commended his
fellow members for helping the city's recycling effort as soda cans
began lining up on the table.
   After the 20th ballot, City Solicitor Danford Wensley suggested a
sure-fire way to break the deadlock _ a duel.
   After the 27th ballot, a motion was made to send a newspaper
reporter to get doughnuts. The motion failed.
   Later tallies ran into trouble as one weary councilor turned in a
blank ballot and another count turned up too many votes.
   Councilor Dan Moynihan said the record for the greatest number of
ballots cast was 104, set in the 1920s. The council will have
another chance to break the record June 12, when it plans to resume
voting on Veno and Hannah.
   The first order of business that evening, however, is a review of
the entire city budget.

<HEAD>Millionaire Polo Player Gets Three Months for Tax Violations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A millionaire polo player who once
entertained the Duke and Duchess of York was sentenced today to
three months in federal prison and ordered to pay a $200,000 fine
for tax violations.
   Peter M. Brant, 43, pleaded guilty in April to misdemeanor
charges of putting his household servants on his company payroll and
using company credit cards to buy jewelry, clothing and antiques for
his family.
   ``I accept the responsibility for the mess that occurred,'' a
contrite Brant told U.S. District Judge T.F. Gilroy Daly, who
imposed a sentence of one year in prison suspended after 90 days.
Brant also received five years probation, during which he must
perform at least 500 hours of community service.
   Brant rushed from the courtroom with his wife after sentencing
and refused to talked with reporters. He must surrender by July 16.
   Federal prosecutors alleged that Brant and members of his family
charged more than $1.5 million in personal expenses to his newsprint
companies from 1981 to 1984.
   Brant's cousin and business partner, Joseph Allen of New York,
and their two newsprint companies, The Bato Co. Inc. and its
subsidiary, Riviere du Loup Newsprint Ltd., also pleaded guilty to
tax charges.
   Daly fined each company a total of $1 million, the maximum.
   Brant, who owns a 1,500-acre estate and is an avid horseman, is a
top-rated polo player and established the Greenwich Polo Club Inc.
in 1983. In 1987, he played host there to Prince Andrew and Sarah
Ferguson, the Duke and Duchess of York, in their first trip to
America after their wedding.
   As part of a plea agreement, Brant had already agreed to pay
$250,000 in taxes owed the federal government and a $125,000 civil
fraud penalty. U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr. said the
government believes Brant may owe still more in taxes.
   Allen, 48, pleaded guilty to the same criminal charges as Brant,
misdemeanor charges of willful failure to maintain records and
conspiracy.
   The government alleged Allen and family members charged more than
$500,000 in personal expenses to Bato and RDL from 1981 to 1984.
   The Bato Co. and RDL Newsprint also pleaded guilty to two felony
charges of filing false tax returns in 1983 to 1984. Bato claimed
more than $1 million in improper business deductions and RDL claimed
more than $200,000 in improper deductions, the government said.
   Brant and his wife also have other business interests, including
Brant Publications, which publishes Antiques, Art In America,
Interview and The Thoroughbred Record.

<HEAD>Yeutter Sees Shift Away From Production Priorities On National
Forests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shift from timber production will mean a
higher priority over the next five years for recreation and wildlife
habitats in national forest management, Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yuetter said Thursday.
   Yeutter and U.S. Forest Service Chief F. Dale Robertson unveiled
a long-term plan for forest and range land resources, calling for
greater environmental sensitivity and a better balance among
multiple uses of public lands.
   The secretary said production levels will be reduced in areas
where timber and mineral production and livestock grazing cannot be
accomplished in an ``environmentally acceptable manner.''
   ``We are looking at multiple-use management from a new
perspective,'' Yeutter said during a news conference at the
Agriculture Department.
   ``This plan calls for some reductions in timber harvests and
livestock range grazing in order to enhance and protect the
ecological balances there,'' he said.
   President Bush, in a formal statement to Congress, called the
blueprint an ``ambitious program'' that ``strongly renews my
commitment to multiple-use management.''
   The plan, which the Agriculture Department is required to present
to Congress every five years under the Resources Planning Act of
1974, was hailed by at least one environmental group for placing
greater emphasis on fishing and wildlife habitats.
   ``In the past they had a telescope on trees period. Much of the
emphasis has been on timber and forest products,'' Trout Unlimited
Executive Director Robert L. Herbst said.
   Leaders of the timber industry condemned the report during a
Tuesday news conference, saying the projections are worthless
because they ignore such critical factors as the anticipated listing
of the rare northern spotted owl as a threatened species.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is to decide by June 23
whether to declare the owl as threatened, a move congressmen in the
Pacific Northwest say would result logging bans across large
sections of the region.
   Yeutter acknowledged the industry's concern that the RPA proposal
will have to be altered to take the owl into consideration if it is
listed under the Endangered Species Act, but he said that will not
be done until a formal announcement is made on the owl's status.
   ``We're not going to do an RPA on the basis of hypotheticals,''
he said.
   Robertson added that timber-based communities should understand
also that the owl listing could carry significant impacts not
accounted for in the RPA report.
   ``There's no question we're going to have to provide more
protection for the spotted owl... even if it's not listed,''
Robertson said.
   Timber harvests on national forest lands, which averaged 12.2
billion board feet from 1983-88, will fall to about 10.8 billion
board feet by 1995 then begin to grow slowly again to about 12
billion board feet by 2040, the report said.

   A 127-pound orangutan escaped from its
cage by unscrewing four large bolts.
   Visitors at Kansas City Zoo's Great Ape House screamed, but no
one was hurt during the animal's brief dash to freedom Wednesday,
zoo officials said.
   ``You've got all these women pushing kids in strollers trying to
get out of there,'' said Beth Cooper, who was in the building with
her husband and two toddlers. ``It was kind of funny.''
   The zoo's public relations director, Jori Glazer, said no one was
injured and the female orangutan, named Cheyenne, was only out of
her glass cage about 20 minutes. The 18-year-old ape, who's been
caged since 1983, was tranquilized by a veterinarian and back in her
cage Wednesday evening.
   Mrs. Cooper said about a dozen people were in the ape house when
they noticed Cheyenne prodding at the window of her cage.
   ``She unscrewed the bolts and just pushed the glass away,'' Mrs.
Cooper said. ``She must have been working on it quite awhile to get
them out. They are huge bolts.''
   Mrs. Glazer such an escape had never occurred before at the
30-year-old circular ape house. She said Cheyenne was never out of
zoo keepers' sights and no one was in danger, adding:
   ``Of course, we moved all the people to the other side of the
zoo. With any wild animal, you never know.''

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk today
lifted the 4-year-old state of emergency in most of the country and
challenged black nationalist leaders to respond to his government's
reforms.
   De Klerk's decision to end repressive emergency measures removes
a major obstacle to negotiations with the African National Congress
on ending apartheid and giving the black majority a voice in the
government.
   ``I have decided to announce there will no longer be a general
countrywide state of emergency, but that henceforth it will exist in
Natal (province) only'' de Klerk said in a speech to Parliament.
   Black factional fighting in the southeastern province of Natal
has left about 500 people dead since the first of the year.
   The president also announced that as a goodwill gesture he was
releasing 48 prisoners convicted of politically motivated crimes.
   Members of the pro-apartheid Conservative Party burst into
laughter when de Klerk began his speech to Parliament by saying he
had received a mandate from white voters for reform.
   ``We are on the threshold of the real negotiation process and the
time has come for other important role players to do their bit,'' de
Klerk said. ``In particular, the ANC must now stop vacillating.''
   Many of the emergency regulations are duplicated in existing
legislation. However, without the regulations, police will no longer
have immunity from prosecution for any action they take in an unrest
situation. Police commissioners lose their power to impose sweeping
bans on public gatherings. They will have to prove the necessity of
each restriction in court.
   Police will lose their control over funerals in black townships.
Government will not be able to suspend or seize newspapers at will.
Police once again will need warrants for most searches and seizures.
   The African National Congress has said the lifting of the
emergency, the release of prisoners and the return of exiles are the
main obstacles to full negotiation on a new constitution.
   The White House called the lifting of the state of emergency in
most of South Africa a sign of ``the remarkable progress.''
   ``We look forward to the early beginning of a negotiating
process,'' deputy White House press secretary Alixe Glen told
reporters flying aboard Air Force One with President Bush to a
speaking engagement in Milwaukee. ``This is another significant step
toward creating a climate conducive to negotiations that will lead
to a democratic, non-racial South Africa.''
   De Klerk said his government has accepted a joint program on
those major issues worked out last month by mid-level officials on
both sides. He said he is ready to implement it, but the ANC has
said it will not have a response until July 10.
   De Klerk says he wants the new constitution to allow the
country's 28 million blacks to share power with the 5 million whites.
   The president today reiterated his call for an end to
international sanctions against his government.
   In Paris, ANC leader Nelson Mandela called de Klerk's move ``a
victory for the people,'' but he urged the West to maintain the
economic sanctions.
   Some South African newspapers have said that by ending the
emergency now de Klerk could be trying to undermine Mandela as he
tours the world calling for continued sanctions.
   The emergency laws, which included some of the harshest
restrictions on political activity ever imposed by South Africa's
white rulers, had to be renewed by midnight Friday if they were to
remain in effect for another year.
   More than 30,000 activists, almost all of them black, have been
detained without trial for varying lengths of time during the
emergency. Others went into hiding. About 300 remain in detention
now.
   Most of the country's leading newspapers had predicted de Klerk
would lift the decree during his speech to lawmakers. A six-hour
Cabinet meeting was held Wednesday at which the emergency was
discussed at length.
   De Klerk's predecessor, P.W. Botha, declared the nationwide
emergency on June 12, 1986, in a bid to quell mounting black unrest.
   De Klerk had nullified some of the emergency restrictions as part
of a series of reforms implemented since he assumed power in August.
He also has released scores of detainees and long-term political
prisoners.
   But de Klerk said today the violence in Natal province ``cannot
be countered with the ordinary laws of the land.''
   The ANC has acknowledged that the violence there is worse than in
other parts of the country. While he has not called for a continued
state of emergency there, Mandela has suggested that the government
use the full force of its military and police to stop the killing.
   The main combatants in Natal are supporters of the African
National Congress and members of the conservative Zulu organization,
Inkatha.
   An estimated 6,000 blacks have died in the past four years, 4,000
of them in black-on-black violence in Natal. But scores have been
killed in clashes with police, including more than 30 deaths in
recent months.
   Mandela, on a six-week trip to Europe, North America and Africa,
conferred with French officials today.
   The lifting of the emergency decree ``is what we have fought for
since the emergency was declared (in June 1986),'' Mandela told
journalists. ``But it doesn't change my mind'' regarding the need
for sanctions.
   In pressuring for an end to apartheid, the United States and
other countries have restricted trade with and investment in South
Africa.
   Mandela was freed in February after more than 27 years in South
African prisons. He and de Klerk have held preliminary negotiations
aimed at clearing away obstacles for formal talks.
   In his speech today, de Klerk again challenged Mandela to stop
advocating continued guerrilla activity. De Klerk criticized
Mandela's statement in Botswana earlier this week that the ANC
approves of ``organized, disciplined violence'' against chosen
targets.
   On two other major issues, de Klerk held out the prospect of
reforms soon. He said the government is considering changing
security legislation that ``could possibly inhibit the free conduct
of peaceful politics.''
   He also said the government has ``started to act'' on allowing
thousands of exiles to return home. The ANC says it has more than
15,000 exiled members.
   Anticipating de Klerk's announcement, Conservative spokesman
Moolman Metnz said beforehand that lifting the emergency would cause
chaos. ``They couldn't cope with the violence even with the state of
emergency because they were not applying it. Our view is the
government is trying to appease everybody.''

<HEAD>House Votes To Override Bush Amtrak Veto</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The House voted 294-123 today to override
President Bush's veto of a bill authorizing $2 billion for Amtrak
and increasing government power over freight railroad acquisitions.
   The override measure went to the Senate, where the vote was
expected to be closer. A two-thirds vote of both houses is required
to turn back a presidential veto. Congress has failed to override
all 10 previous Bush vetoes.
   Bush has said he would support Amtrak funding, unlike former
President Reagan, but objected to increased power to be given the
Interstate Commerce Commission, calling it ``a step backward for the
entire rail industry.''
   Democrats argued that the ICC already has power over sale of a
portion of a railroad or sale of more than one railroad to investors
outside the industry but has decided it cannot scrutinize sale of a
whole railroad.
   House GOP Leader Bob Michel of Illinois introduced a bill today
before the veto vote that contained all of the provisions of the
Amtrak legislation except for the ICC section.
   ``The president is committed to an adequate passenger rail
service,'' Michel told the House, adding that Bush would not veto
the new measure.
   The veto has had affected daily train operations because the
railroad is working with money that Congress already had
appropriated. The bill envisions more than $2 billion going to
Amtrak through Sept. 30, 1992. Actual amounts will be determined
when Congress appropriates the money.
   The veto had threatened plans for a commuter line between
Washington, D.C., and its Northern Virginia suburbs. It contained
technical provisions necessary for the project to begin.
   The measure also contained a provision that would save Amtrak $16
million over two years in unemployment insurance payments for
railroad workers.

<HEAD>Transit Authority to Relax Ban on Baby Strollers in Subways</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First came love. Then came marriage. Then came
the couple with a baby carriage, only transit officials wouldn't let
them on the subway with it.
   After parents threw a tantrum, the ban was lifted Wednesday.
   ``The TA loves children,'' Transit Authority President Alan
Kiepper said in announcing that strollers will be allowed in the
system starting Monday.
   ``Hurrah, hurrah,'' said Andy Breslau, a spokesman for Manhattan
Borough President Ruth Messinger, who lead a ``stroll-in'' with
parents to protest the ban.
   Strollers have been a no-no in the subway system for some time,
but officials began enforcing it recently.
   ``We applaud the president's reconsideration and urge him to
remove whatever barriers there are to parents and their children
using and enjoying public transportation,'' Breslau said.
   Ed Barbini, a spokesman for state Attorney General Robert Abrams,
said Kiepper's office had asked to meet with Abrams on Monday after
the attorney general threatened to sue.
   ``We never met,'' Barbini said. ``That's probably the most
successful type meeting you can have in government: when the issue
is resolved before you sit down at the table.''
   Kiepper said he had not been influenced by the threat or
stroll-in.
   ``I don't feel pressured in all of this. We made a calm
reassessment,'' Kiepper said.
   He added that because of ramps and stairways in the subway, ``If
strollers do come onto the system, they need to be handled with
great care.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two top Senate Ethics Committee members
said today there has been no plea bargaining with Sen. Dave
Durenberger in his financial misconduct case and declared the panel
is ready to begin public hearings next week.
   About 200 potential witnesses have been contacted for the panel's
first trial-like hearings since 1981, but not all are likely to
testify in the proceedings that begin Tuesday, according to
Committee Chairman Howell Heflin, D-Ala. and Vice Chairman Warren B.
Rudman, R-N.H.
   Durenberger, R-Minn. has refused in recent weeks to comment on
the case, which will determine whether his actions broke Senate
rules. The senator has appeared before the committee twice in closed
session, but ``there has been no plea bargaining,'' Heflin told a
news conference.
   ``There's been no plea bargaining here whatsoever,'' Rudman
added. ``We're not in the nature of trading.''
   Durenberger had touched off speculation of plea bargaining when
he said last month that he had been talking informally with the
committee and that the hearing date served as a deadline for
reaching a settlement in the case.
   The committee previously announced it found ``substantial
credible evidence'' of financial wrongdoing by Durenberger, who
previously admitted mistakes in judgment.
   Some of the allegations cover transactions from 1983 to 1989,
relating to a Minneapolis condominium that Durenberger partly owned
_ and for which he received Senate reimbursements.
   Other charges are connected to money collected by Durenberger in
promoting two books he wrote and his acceptance of free limousine
rides. These alleged violations took place in 1985 and 1986.
   A number of facts in the case are not in dispute, and Heflin said
``the issue of intent is one issue that may be involved, among
many.''
   The senators said Durenberger and his attorney, Jim Hamilton _
and committee special counsel Robert Bennett _ could file an
agreement that certain events took place, thus negating the need for
some testimony.
   ``This is not an easy case,'' Rudman said, adding, ``There is not
the kind of tension that you may think.''
   When the hearings are completed, the special counsel will make a
report to the panel, and the committee would then make
recommendations to the Senate. If there's a conviction for breaking
the rules, the committee could recommend punishment ranging from a
reprimand to expulsion _ although the latter is not likely.

   The son of late President Gamal Abdel Nasser
pleaded innocent Thursday to a series of terrorist attacks that
killed two Israeli diplomats and wounded six Israelis and two
Americans.
   Khaled Abdel Nasser, 40, was freed on bail following the court
hearing. He wore a dark gray suit and white shirt and sat calmly
inside a barred defendant's cage during most of the session.
   Nasser, who could be hanged if convicted, returned Wednesday
night from abroad. Judge Emad el-Din Ismail of the state security
court set bail at $1,858 and ordered him not to leave Egypt until
his trial ends.
   ``I trust the justice of the Egyptian judiciary,'' Nasser said
afterward, refusing further comment.
   The court session was adjourned until Saturday.
   Nasser and 19 others are accused of four attacks against Israeli
and American diplomats, one a year between 1984 and 1987.
   Prosecutors are demanding death sentences for the late
president's son and 10 others.
   The other nine, charged with complicity, face prison terms of up
to 25 years. One is Nasser's cousin and the late president's nephew,
a physician accused of treating a wounded gunman without informing
authorities.
   In Egypt, defendants are listed according to the seriousness of
their alleged crimes, and Khaled Abdel Nasser is the second accused
in this case.
   He and the others facing possible capital punishment are charged
with forming a terrorist group called ``Egypt's Revolution'' and
financing it with money and military support from Libya.
   Nasser fled Egypt on Sept. 11, 1987, and made his way to
Yugoslavia by the time the indictment was announced in February 1988.
   Nasser was arrested immediately upon his return to Cairo on
Wednesday night. He told police at Cairo International Airport he
returned ``to prove my innocence.''
   Nasser's charismatic father headed a military group that seized
power and ousted King Farouk in July 1952. His ideas on Arab unity
and nationhood became immensely popular throughout the Arab world.
   He died of a heart attack in 1970.
   Nasser's lawyer, Ahmed el-Khawaga, said the prosecution's main
evidence against Nasser is a confession made by another defendant.
   The prosecutor, Abdel-Meguid Mahmoud, objected to bail, citing
Nasser's flight from prosecution for so many months. Bail is not
generally granted when such serious charges are involved.
   Defense lawyer el-Khawaga denied any deal had been made prior to
Nasser's return. He said Nasser made the decision on his own.

   Lawmakers on Thursday praised Chinese
demonstrators for inspiring East Germany's own peaceful revolution
and apologized for a resolution supporting last year's violent
crackdown in Beijing.
   East Germany's Parliament, which was elected March 18 in the
nation's first free elections, passed by a voice vote a declaration
meant to erase the former Communist government's support of the
Chinese crackdown.
   ``The first freely elected Parliament ... regrets the former
declaration. The Parliament members remember the victims with
profound sorrow,'' the declaration said.
   The former Communist-controlled Parliament pasng a declaration
June 8, 1989, that expressed support for the Chinese government's
military attack on protesters in Beijing.
   The old resolution was passed four days after troops rolled
through Beijing and into the capital's Tiananmen Square, killing
hundreds and perhaps thousands of people.
   The declaration approved Thursday drew parallels to China's
thwarted democracy movement and East Germany's own revolt, which
began with protests in the middle of last year and grew to mass
demonstrations by the fall.
   The unrest toppled the government of Erich Honecker in October
and forced open the Berlin Wall in November.
   Several German news reports since then have said East Germany's
hard-liners had considered a ``Chinese solution'' to the mass
demonstrations.
   ``In awareness that the courageous beginning of the Beijing
demonstrators bestowed in the GDR the essential impulses for the
young democracy movement ... and in knowledge that in October 1989
there was a danger of a similar fate, the members of Parliament
express hope that also in China there will be democratic
developments,'' the Parliament declaration said.

<TEXT>
   An American nurse on Thursday
asked Washington to fly in supplies for a hospital she built in My
Lai, the village where U.S. troops committed their worst atrocity of
the Vietnam War.
   Three weeks ago, Cherie Clark and her private International
Mission of Hope inaugurated the two-story hospital at My Lai, where
soldiers of Charlie Company shot hundreds of villagers to death in
1968.
   But the hospital remains an empty building. The $300,000 of
medical supplies needed to open it are in Atlanta and Portland, and
the cost of privately transporting them to Vietnam is too high, said
Ms. Clark, of Denver.
   Ms. Clark, a volunteer nurse in Vietnam during the war, said
Washington has agreed in principle to take the supplies along when
space is available on its aircraft going to Hanoi, Vietnam's
capital. But it gave no commitment and no supplies have gone thus
far, she said.
   The U.S. government has embargoed all trade and official aid to
Vietnam since the war ended in 1975.
   ``We're saying to the U.S. government: Give us a break this time.
Fly the supplies here. The people are suffering all sorts of
ailments,'' Ms. Clark said in an interview in Ho Chi Minh City,
where she has an office.
   Ms. Clark said more than half the children in the My Lai area,
about 340 miles northeast of Ho Chi Minh City, are malnourished.
   She said villagers wept at the inauguration of the hospital,
built by about 100 local laborers on the spot where the U.S.
helicopters landed on the bloody day in March 1968. The handful of
survivors recalled how they lay under heaps of bodies, she said.
   ``The old men were looking at us, and the kids were holding me
and they wouldn't let go,'' Ms. Clark said.
   ``We wanted to bring health care to them,'' she said. ``We wanted
them to know that there were different kinds of Americans, that some
care even though it was 20 years ago.
   ``They say they cannot forgive, but they love the new Americans
who have come back,'' she said.
   On March 16, 1968, Charlie Company's first platoon led by Lt.
William L. Calley Jr. killed at least 175 Vietnamese men, women and
children at My Lai, according to the 1970 report of a U.S. Army
inquiry.
   A plaque in the village is inscribed with the names of 504 men,
women and children Vietnamese officials say died there.
   Calley was the only soldier convicted for the massacre at a
court-martial in March 1971. He was sentenced to life imprisonment.
   Following a public outcry, then-President Richard Nixon reduced
his sentence to 20 years, and Calley actually served just three
years under house arrest before his conviction was overturned by a
federal judge.
   The United States withdrew from Vietnam in 1973. In April 1975,
the South Vietnam government it backed fell to Communist forces from
the north.
   After Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978, Washington
reaffirmed the embargo and the withholding of diplomatic relations
with Hanoi. It says that will change only with a political
resolution of the continuing Cambodian war.
   The work of Ms. Clark and other private citizens was eased after
the United States in 1987 pledged to facilitate non-government
humanitarian aid to Vietnam, in exchange for cooperation on
resolving the status of about 1,800 missing U.S. soldiers.

   State Rep. Nyla Murphy today filed for the
GOP gubernatorial nomination, saying she believed Republicans should
have a choice in the primary.
   The field of Republican candidates has dwindled from more than
half a dozen to just rancher Mary Mead. That brought accusations
that GOP ``power brokers'' were behind Mead's campaign and had
successfully discouraged all other contenders for the nomination.
   ``I call them king makers. I guess I should say queen makers,''
said Murphy. ``... I think there are some money powers, money
brokers, behind the opponent's candidacy.''
   A 12-year member of the House of Representatives, the 59-year-old
Murphy from Casper said she was approached about two weeks ago to
oppose Mead, and that after mulling the idea for about a week
decided to enter the race.
   The state representative refrained from directly attacking Mead,
saying she knew little about her. Mead, 54, was an unsuccessful
candidate for state senator in the 1970s and is a former president
of the Wyoming Heritage Society. She is the daughter of Cliff
Hansen, a former Wyoming governor and U.S. senator in the 1970s.
   Democratic Gov. Mike Sullivan is seeking a second term, and is
opposed by Ron Suds Clingman, a first-time gubernatorial candidate.

<TEXT>
   The Senate failed today to break a filibuster
against an anti-crime bill that included curbs on semiautomatic
weapons, and sponsors called for negotiations to save the measure
from being scuttled.
   The vote was 57-37 in favor of imposing a time limit on debate _
six short of the 60 votes needed.
   ``The only way we're really likely to get a bill is if we can
enter into negotiations,'' Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., told
the Senate.
   The action represented a victory for the National Rifle
Association, which opposed the measure's gun provisions.
   The bill also includes provisions instituting the death penalty
for 30 federal crimes and is designed to end delays of up to a
decade in carrying out executions.
   It also would allow courts to consider evidence gathered with
flawed warrants in some cases.
   Democratic leaders said debating each of 300 amendments waiting
in the hopper would fuel a filibuster with endless delays. They said
in advance of the vote that failure to impose a 30-hour time limit
would kill the bill.
   Biden, chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the measure's
floor manager, took the floor minutes after the vote and declared
that it had been ``do or die time for the crime bill and it just
died.''
   Within two hours, however, Biden returned to say he was
``confident our staffs can literally in a matter of an hour or so
bring to a resolution all the remaining issues.''
   ``I feel we can reach an agreement on one or two other provisions
and pass this bill,'' said Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., one of the
measure's handful of Republican supporters. `` ... I think we can
work it out.''
   On the roll call, 11 Republicans joined 46 Democrats in voting
for a time limit. Seven Democrats and 30 Republicans opposed it.
   Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas urged the Senate to push
ahead with action on the bill even without a limit on debate. ``This
is an important bill,'' he declared. ``... If we want a crime bill,
the majority can have one.''
   Biden blamed the National Rifle Association for the surge of
amendments. The gun group had been widely expected to win a Senate
battle two weeks ago to drop restrictions on semiautomatic assault
weapons.
   In a surprise move, the Senate rejected a move to drop the curbs.
   Biden said the NRA hoped to block final action on the bill by
encouraging lawmakers to let debate flow on indefinitely.
   The campaign to curb such weapons began in January 1989 after a
deranged man with an assault rifle opened fire on a Stockton,
Calif., school yard, leaving five youngsters dead and 30 other
persons hurt.
   The NRA as well as federal firearms experts say, however, that
the so-called assault weapons differ only in their military styling
from normal semiautomatic hunting rifles with their traditional
brown wooden stocks.
   NRA lobbyist David Conover said Wednesday the group sent out
``targeted alerts to half a dozen to eight states, to a portion of
our membership in each state,'' urging them to press senators to
vote against shutting off debate.
   He stressed the political dividends lawmakers see in keeping
alive a death penalty measure with voters aroused over the issue.

   Johnson, 41, said he planned to return to an academic career.
   The Aug. 3 departure will give President Bush the chance to make
another appointment to the seven-member board that directs the
nation's monetary policy.
   The administration at various times in past months has been
openly critical of the Fed's efforts to restrain inflation by
keeping interest rates high.
   There was a published report in March quoting an unnamed Bush
adviser as saying the president was ``mad as hell'' with Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and would not reappoint him as
chairman.
   Bush later insisted there was ``no bubbling war'' with Greenspan,
but left the clear impression he would like to see more aggressive
action on the part of the Fed to lower interest rates.
   Analysts said it was likely that Bush would appoint someone to
the Fed who would be more amenable to the administration's pleas for
lower interest rates.
   ``This administration has been jawboning the Fed on and off for
some time for a looser monetary policy,'' said Kenneth Guenther of
the Independent Bankers Association of America. ``They want lower
interest rates because they don't want the economy moving into a
recession.''
   Fed officials have been pursuing a ``soft-landing'' approach for
the economy in which interest rates are used to slow growth enough
to ease inflationary pressures but not enough to tip the country
into a recession.
   Many analysts believe that approach is working and that the Fed
is unlikely to change course even with a new vice chairman appointed
by Bush.
   ``The Fed isn't closely divided now where one vote in either
direction would make much of a difference,'' said Lyle Gramley, a
former Fed governor and now chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers
Association.
   The administration had no immediate comment on Johnson's
departure. The president will have the opportunity to either name
someone new to the board and designate that person as vice chairman
or select one of the other governors as vice chairman while
appointing someone else to fill Johnson's board term, which runs
until Aug. 21, 2000.
   There was speculation that David Mullins, appointed to the Fed
earlier this year, might be considered for the vice chairman's job.
   Mullins, one of the authors of the savings and loan bailout
legislation, had been a top assistant to Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady.
   Johnson was appointed to the Fed by President Reagan on Feb. 7,
1986, and was elevated to vice chairman six months later.
   He said his resignation would be effective at the end of his
four-year term as vice chairman.
   ``I am extremely proud to have played a part in the unprecedented
period of sustained economic growth and low inflation that has
characterized the decade of the 1980s and continues into the
1990s,'' Johnson said in his letter of resignation.
   Johnson said he planned to return to George Mason University in
Washington's Virginia suburbs and assume the Koch Chair in
international economics and become director of the Center for Global
Market Studies.
   He was a professor at the school in 1981 when he was selected to
join the economics team assembled by then-Treasury Secretary Donald
Regan in Reagan's first term.
   ``I deeply regret, but understand, Manley Johnson's decision,''
Greenspan said in a statement. ``The vice chairman and I have been
an effective team. I'll miss him.''
   The Fed, the nation's central bank headquartered in Washington,
is run by the board of governors and a nationwide network of 12
district banks. The governors are appointed by the president and
confirmed by the Senate to serve 14-year terms.

   A Japanese fishing boat collided with a Norwegian

missing, authorities said.
   Fumio Ichinosawa, an official of the Maritime Safety Agency,
Japan's coast guard, said four Japanese fishermen were rescued by
the Norwegian ship Nopal Cherry.
   He said 15 fishermen were aboard the Yugen-maru when it collided
with the Nopal Cherry about 50 miles east of the island of

   He said the Nopal Cherry suffered no major damage and none of its

<TEXT>
   President Bush, in his first speech since the
superpower summit, today praised President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as
``a remarkable man'' helping to usher in a new era in U.S.-Soviet
relations.
   Bush made the remarks at a Republican luncheon here for Gov.
Tommy Thompson on the first stop of a four-state Midwestern swing by
the president to raise money for GOP candidates.
   En route to Milwaukee on Air Force One, a White House statement
welcomed the lifting of the 4-year-old state of emergency in most of
South Africa.
   ``We welcome the announcement,'' said deputy press secretary
Alixe Glen. ``This is another significant step toward creating a
climate conducive to negotiations that will lead to a democratic,
non-racial South Africa.''
   But even as Bush shifted his attention to domestic politics, he
was looking back at what he called ``a very productive Washington
summit.''
   Bush ran down a list of arms and trade agreements that he and
Gorbachev signed. He said even on the tough issues that the summit
did not solve, such as German membership in NATO and the future of
the Baltic states, they made progress with the candor of their
discussions.
   ``Of course we have differences ... I want to see Lithuania have
its freedom. We are committed to self-determfination for the Baltic
states. Although I ... am pleased that the emigration of Soviet Jews
is at an all-time high, I want to see unfettered emigration,'' he
said.
   ``We have differences on Cuba and, for now, on a united Germany
in NATO and on many other issues as well,'' added Bush.
   ``But as I chatted informally with President Gorbachev at Camp
David, I kept thinking that this new Soviet leader, committed to
reform and openness, is indeed a remarkable man,'' he said.
   He praised the Soviet leader ``for the forthright spirit in which
he addressed every issue on the table, and I take it as proof that
we have indeed entered a new era in our relations with the Soviet
Union.''
   Bush also had stops planned in Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska today
and Friday to campaign for U.S. Senate and gubernatorial contenders.
   In both Wisconsin and Iowa, the thorny issue of abortion promises
to figure prominently in the November campaigns.
   Thompson is considered in strong shape in a well-funded
re-election bid against four-term Democratic Assembly Speaker Thomas
Loftus.
   After the Milwaukee luncheon, Bush was heading to Chicago to put
his prestige behind one of the GOP's top-priority governor's races _
Secretary of State Jim Edgar's bid against Democratic state Attorney
General Neil Hartigan to succeed outgoing Republican Gov. James R.
Thompson.
   The party hopes the president's campaign efforts in Illinois also
will provide a boost to Rep. Lynn Martin's tough battle against
incumbent Democratic Sen. Paul Simon.
   As is the White House custom of combining public events with
political trips _ with the taxpayers paying for the presidential
events and the Republican Party sharing costs for political portions
_ Bush also had a series of education and other policy-oriented
appearances.
   The White House is planning increasingly frequent campaign trips
for Bush as the November election nears.
   ``This is the type of thing the president will do a lot of,''
said a national party official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``The best thing the president can do now is to provide material
resources for these candidates,'' by appearing at high-priced
fund-raisers.
   On Wednesday, the president met with South Korean President Roh
Tae-woo to discuss Roh's talks in San Francisco with Gorbachev after
the Soviet leader left Washington on Sunday.
   When he returns to Washington on Friday night, Bush will host
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for further post-summit
consultations.
   On Friday, Bush will be in Des Moines for incumbent Gov. Terry
Branstad, who will be feted at a $150-a-ticket breakfast, and also
benefit from a $2,000-per-person private gathering with Bush.
   Abortion has emerged as an issue in Branstad's forthcoming race
against House Speaker Don Avenson, selected by Democrats on Tuesday
as their nominee, as well as in the state's Senate contest.
Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin is pro-choice, and his Republican
challenger, Rep. Tom Tauke, is anti-abortion.
   Avenson credited his pro-choice position for his victory over an
anti-abortion primary opponent and said he will campaign on the
issue against Branstad as well.
   In Wisconsin, Democrat Loftus said he also plans to make abortion
an issue against Thompson. Loftus claims Thompson has been
unsympathetic to feminist causes.
   Thompson endorses abortion in cases of incest, rape and when the
mother's life is threatened. He also supported a proposal that would
have required unemancipated girls under 18 to have the consent of at
least one parent or a judge before obtaining an abortion.
   Bush has made a point as president of opening the doors of the
GOP to both pro-choice and anti-abortion backers. He opposes
abortion except in cases of rape, incest or threat to the mother's
life.
   From Iowa, Bush goes to Nebraska for an Omaha luncheon for Senate
contender Hal Daub, recruited by the Republicans to take on two-term
incumbent James Exon. Daub, a former congressman, lost his bid for
the GOP nomination against former Sen. David Karnes in the state's
last Senate election.

<HEAD>Rebels Claim to Have Killed 1,870 Government Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethiopian rebels claimed Thursday they had
killed 1,870 government troops in two days of fighting early this
week near a strategic town north of the capital.
   The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, in a
clandestine broadcast, said 1,990 soldiers were wounded in the
battles south of Dessie, the heavily defended capital of Wollo
province.
   The front is a combined force of the Tigre People's Liberation
Front and the Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement, a much smaller
group.
   The broadcast, monitored in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, said the
fighting took place Sunday and Monday about 90 miles north of Addis
Ababa.
   Both the rebels and President Mengistu Haile Mariam's government
claimed victories in the same area last week.
   It was impossible to verify either claim because the war zone is
generally inaccessible to journalists and other independent
witnesses.
   If the rebels' claim Thursday is true, the insurgents would be
only six miles south of Dessie. The town is at the junction of a
major road northeast to Ethiopia's Red Sea port of Assab.
   Dessie is also the main depot for emergency food being
distributed to famine victims in Wollo and Tigre provinces.
   The food is trucked from Assab, the only port in government hands
since rebels captured Massawa in February.
   The Eritreans are fighting a three-decade war for the
independence of Ethiopia's northermost province of Eritrea.
   The Tigreans have been fighting for 15 years seeking Mengistu's
ouster and the establishment of a hard-line Marxist state. They took
control of Tigre province early last year.

<HEAD>Group Says Homemaking a `High-Risk' Job</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Displaced homemakers often face poverty and
limited job opportunities, a private group said Thursday.
   ``If you choose homemaking, you're choosing a very high-risk
occupation,'' said Jill Miller, executive director of the National
Displaced Homemakers Network.
   Women forced to seek jobs outside the home after spending years
as full-time homemakers often lack training and have to take
part-time, seasonal jobs, Miller said.
   The number of displaced homemakers rose 12 percent over the past
decade, from 13.9 million in 1980 to 15.6 million in 1989, according
to a report by the Washington-based group based on Census Bureau
figures.
   Displaced homemakers are women whose main job was homemaking, but
who lost their key source of income through widowhood, divorce,
separation or because a spouse suffered disability or long-term
unemployment.
   ``We are penalizing (homemakers) and leaving them high and dry
when they make that choice,'' she said, noting that other workers
are eligible for unemployment benefits.
   Nearly three in five displaced homemakers were living near or
below the poverty level, the report said. About one in five, or 3
million American women, are living in households with other
families, it said.
   The group said there were 22 million American married women in
1989 who were full-time homemakers.

<HEAD>Official Foresees Accord on `Wide Window' to Space Defense Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union and United States may agree
this year on an experimental program for increasing each side's
observation of the other's anti-missile defense work, a senior U.S.
negotiator said Thursday.
   David Smith, chief U.S. delegate to the Geneva negotiations on
defense and space, told reporters such an accord was possible as
early as this year. But he saw little likelihood of completing a
formal treaty on the use of space-based defenses against strategic
ballistic missiles within the next two years.
   He said there was no official target date for completing the
Defense and Space Treaty, which, in the U.S. view, would govern a
gradual transition by both countries from offensive to defensive
means of deterring nuclear war. But the Soviets don't accept that
concept, saying it would lead to a new, more expensive, more
dangerous and unpredictable arms race in space.
   Smith said the experimental program, as proposed by the United
States, would be an important sign of progress in the Geneva talks,
which have been bogged down lately.
   The United States has proposed an executive agreement on
``predictability measures'' designed to build confidence in both
Washington and Moscow that neither side is trying to conceal its
intentions in researching space-based dcist running hard in Arkansas and
a charismatic ex-Klan
leader seeking to represent Louisiana in the U.S. Senate.
   While mainstream candidates denounce the extremist views, some
civil rights officials voice concern.
   They see a fearful trend in the candidacies of J.B. Stoner and
Ralph Forbes, who seek nominations for lieutenant governor in
Georgia and Arkansas, and are especially troubled by David Duke's
run for the Senate in Louisiana.
   ``This is part of a new strategy that the white supremacists have
developed ... to work within the electoral system while at the same
time building their underground operation,'' says Eva Sears of the
Center for Democratic Renewal, an Atlanta-based organization that
monitors the Ku Klux Klan and similar groups.
   The Klan has elected members to Congress and to many state
offices in the past, but those who watch white supremacists say
their strategies have evolved and the stakes have gone up.
   ``What's new is the extent of the support that they're getting,''
says Irwin Suall of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in
New York.
   ``Financial support, votes,'' Suall continues, ``the amount seems
to be sufficient to take them out of the category of fringe
candidate.''
   Duke, who left the Klan to lead the National Association for the
Advancement of White People, has reported receiving nearly $600,000
in donations to his campaign for the GOP nomination for the seat now
held by Sen. Bennett Johnston. Duke insists he's now merely a
champion of whites' civil rights, not a white supremacist.
   Forbes, a former American Nazi leader, won 46 percent of the vote
in last month's primary for the GOP nomination for Arkansas
lieutenant governor. A runoff is set for Tuesday.
   ``The numbers that Ralph Forbes polled ... will be used time and
time and time again to show that people do sympathize with the views
of white supremacists,'' says Pat Clark, who heads Klanwatch, a
monitoring group in Montgomery, Ala.
   The balloting figures will become ``a recruiting tool,'' she
says. ``It's not necessary always to have a definite victory, in the
sense of being elected.''
   Indeed, victory often has been elusive since the Klan's electoral
successes of the 1920s, when, as University of Florida history
professor David Chalmers puts it, ``the Ku Klux Klan elected
senators and governors literally from Maine to California.''
   Even President Warren Harding agreed to be sworn in as a KKK
member in a White House ceremony, according to another scholar, Wyn
Craig Wade, in his Klan history, ``The Fiery Cross.''
   But at that time, the Klan was at its height, with an estimated 5
million members. Now, monitoring groups say, there are perhaps 5,000
KKK members and 17,000 or so Americans who belong to other racist
organizations.
   That's part of the reason why some thought Duke's 1989 victory on
his third try for a seat in the Louisiana Legislature was
significant.
   It ``propelled people to think, `OK, now we've seen it be
successful; let's try it once more.' We've definitely seen more
people jump on the bandwagon,'' says Ms. Clark.
   ``It was the first time they've been able to successfully elect
people to office since the demise of Jim Crow in the 1960s,'' says
Leonard Zeskind, research director of the Center for Democratic
Renewal.
   ``These guys ran for office before ... but they never had this
kind of strategy _ of being a hardcore white supremacist and passing
yourself off as a right-to-lifer ... or anti-affirmative action.''
   Duke, in a telephone inteview from Baton Rouge, says he's been
misunderstood and maligned, but he agrees with civil rights
officials that a victory in the U.S. Senate race Oct. 6 would
reverberate far beyond Louisiana.
   ``I think a Senate victory would send a message to elected
officials across America that they've got to start listening to the
majority,'' Duke says.``When I'm elected with my admittedly
controversial background, it's going to make it easier for other
people to begin to talk about the issues that I'm speaking about.''
   Asked about photos of himself in Nazi garb, Duke dismisses them
as part of a ``college stunt'' when he picketed a left-wing campus
speaker.
   Asked about statements attributed to him in his own NAAWP News _
such as, ``The media is dominated by Jews ... not good Americans''
and ``North Americans and Europeans are like islands of light in a
hungry and backward Third World Sea.'' _ Duke says now, ``I believe
in freedom. ... I don't believe in forced integration and I also
don't believe in forced segregation. ... I believe in less
government.''
   Asked about his leadership of a Klan group, he notes that was 12
years ago.
   ``I think I have a right to change and develop just like anybody
else,'' he says.
   He adds that many of his views differ from those of Forbes, who
was once his campaign manager, and of Stoner.
   Forbes, running against a black candidate in the runoff, recently
reiterated his belief that ``racial separation is ultimately the
right answer.''
   A minister, Forbes cites the Bible in support of his views.
   His runoff opponent, Kenneth ``Muskie'' Harris, speculates that
Forbes might have placed first in the primary because, although he
wasn't well-known, he had better name recognition than his two
opponents and his name was listed first on the ballot. His former
membership in the Nazi Party also was not widely known among voters.
   As for Stoner, who served a prison term for bombing a black
church in Alabama in 1958, his anti-black and anti-Semitic campaign
rhetoric has prompted some fellow Democratic candidates to threaten
to boycott joint appearances.
   Analysts give Stoner no chance of winning in the July 17 primary,
but say racist candidates may tap into a backlash among some white
voters.
   Wayne Parent, a professor of political science at Louisiana State
University who has followed Duke's career, says he and other
candidates represent ``the remnants of George Wallace-ism'' and hope
to take advantage of voter resentment of changes in society brought
on by the civil rights movement.
   Duke has been denied official Republican sanction, ``but as far
as making those Republicans turn to the right, he seems to have had
some success,'' Parent says, ``because his message is selling better
than people thought.''
   Jane Hardisty, director of the Cambridge, Mass.-based Political
Research Associates, which studies the political right wing, says
white supremacists have devoted themselves to politics more
seriously since a series of arrests in the 1980s ``effectively set
back the violent approach as the medium for the message.''
   Voiced by politicians who carry no guns and wear no robes, the
message still has a waiting audience, she says.
   ``If you're in a position where your standard of living is
falling, you have job insecurity that you didn't use to have, you're
looking for an explanation for that,'' Ms. Hardisty says.
   ``And they're providing a fairly simple, easy scapegoat _ blame
it on some specific group, the Jews or the blacks, whoever.''
   Resentment among the electorate and the increasing sophistication
of white supremacist candidates make a formidable combination that
is hard to disentangle, says Ms. Sears of the Center for Democratic
Renewal:
   ``If you had a big fire, how much of it was the dry wood and how
much was the gasoline?''

   Crews using bulldozers, dump trucks and
front-end loaders today began clearing away the debris left by a
tornado that devastated this farming community's commercial strip
and a trailer park.
   Twelve people were injured, but warning sirens apparently averted
more serious casualties.
   Lincoln County sheriff's deputies and other public safety
employees conducted a house-to-house search today; afterward, they
said they believed every resident was accounted for.
   Officials estimated that the twister damaged 90 percent of the
downtown district and more than half the residences of this eastern
Colorado plains town.
   One grain silo was flattened like a beer can. Most of the town's
structures were twisted masses of metal and wood, and several
railroad cars were overturned.
   The sirens wailed for 10 minutes before the twister struck
Wednesday night, giving residents time to take shelter, officials
and survivors said.
   Gov. Roy Romer, who flew to the shattered town on a National
Guard helicopter early today, said he would seek a federal disaster
declaration.
   ``The business district is 50 to 75 percent destroyed,'' he said,
adding that damage was likely to run into the tens of millions.
   The town, 80 miles east of Denver, is known for helping
blizzard-stranded travelers forced off Interstate 70.
   It was without water, but limited electricity and telephone
service were reported restored by late morning, officials said.
   National Guardsmen brought bedding, food and other supplies.
   The town hall, a bank, a supermarket, a video store and a
nightclub were destroyed along Main Street.
   Most of the businesses were closed at the time; 10 people in the
nightclub were saved by taking refuge in the bar's cooler, a witness
said.
   Three guests at the Lariat Hotel piled into their bathtub and
pulled a mattress over themselves after the sirens went off.
   ``We were doing a lot of praying in that bathtub,'' said David
Thomas, 27.
   The tornado tore their room apart. ``It felt like somebody just
reached down and squeezed your whole body. My eardrums were coming
out,'' Thomas said.
   Most of the 20 to 25 homes at a trailer park on the edge of town
were damaged or destroyed, resident Bernard Goetz said.
   ``It's a lot of havoc, a lot of destruction, a lot of homes gone
out there,'' Goetz said.
   Two people were hospitalized; one was reported in serious but
stable condition with a fractured pelvis.
   The tornado spun out of thunderstorms that swept the plains east
of Denver with heavy rain and baseball-size hail. The National
Weather Service said nine other tornadoes touched down on the plains.
   In eastern El Paso County, two people were trapped in a mobile
home for about two hours after it was hit by a tornado late
Wednesday, Sgt. Dean Kelsey said. Both were hospitalized in Colorado
Springs.

   Where were the crime-fighting,
pepperoni pizza-munching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles when Domino's
delivery man Troy Brewer really needed them?
   After all, they may have known his alleged hard-shelled attacker.
   Brewer said he was at a pay phone when he was robbbed by a pair
of thieves armed with a snapping turtle.
   ``That sucker was going to bite me,'' he said. ``They put him
right up to my face.''
   The toothsome turtle didn't nip the flustered pizza delivery man,
but those wielding the turtle got away with his money pouch
containing about $50, he said.
   ```Don't move or you're gonna get bit,''' Brewer said robbers
told him.
   Brewer, a college student who works in Balch Springs, filed a
police complaint in Dallas because he said Tuesday night's robbery
occurred just inside the city limits.
   Balch Springs Assistant Police Chief B.W. Smith said it was first
robbery at turtle-point he's ever heard of.
   ``I suppose if he said it happened, I guess it did. Personally, I
just can't see somebody holding somebody up with a turtle,'' he said.
   Brewer said he was still shaken a day later: ``It was a big,
huge, ugly turtle.''

   Swashbuckling leading man Harrison Ford is donating
the bullwhip he used in his ``Indiana Jones'' movies to help raise
funds for a new archaeology studies building, organizers said
Thursday.
   ``He brought archaeology alive for the general public,'' said
Cathy Giangrande, organizer of the Institute of Archaeology's
fund-raising drive.
   Ford has made three films playing the role of adventurous
archaeology professor Indiana Jones for director Steven Spielberg.
   Ford's bullwhip will be sold with other film and entertainment
memorabilia at Christie's auction house in December.
   ``We don't know what it will fetch. Christie's said the price
depends on who goes to the sale and how badly two or more bidders
might want it,'' Ms. Giangrande said.
   The fund-raising effort is to raise $6.7 million for the new
building at the archaeology institute located at University College,

   Rep. John Conyers got hitched this week in a
wedding so private that his chief of staff claimed to know nothing
about it.
   According to the marriage license, his wife was born in 1964 _
the same year the 61-year-old Conyers won his first congressional
election, the Detroit Free Press reported Thursday.
   Records at the Wayne County Clerk's Office show he married Monica
Ann Esters, 25, of Detroit. Records also indicated the marriage
Monday was Conyers' first.
   ``Why would he have gotten married? What are people saying?
What's the scuttlebutt?'' Julian Epstein, Conyers' chief of staff in
Washington, asked Wednesday when queried about the wedding.
   Conyers spokeswoman Leslie Kaufman said Thursday she would not
confirm or deny the reported marriage.
   ``It's his personal life. He's not discussing it,'' she said.

   Actor Robby Benson, whose six-figure
earnings at the University of South Carolina stirred controversy, is
being wooed to remain in the Palmetto State.
   The State Development Board and Columbia College are working on a
package deal to keep the actor and filmmaker in the state.
   The board that works to attract business and industry into the
state, unanimously approved contract negotiations with Benson on
Wednesday.
   But Isabel M. Hill, head of the Development Board's film office,
said talks with Benson had not moved past ``very cursory initial
contact.''
   Officials asked Benson and his wife, singer-actress Karla DeVito,
if they would consider staying in South Carolina, possibly to teach
at Columbia College and help bring movie producers to the state, she
said.
   Benson was caught up in negative publicity surrounding University
of South Carolina President James B. Holderman, who resigned last
week amid reports of lavish spending.
   Among spending criticized was the $158,367 in salary and living
expenses the school paid Benson over the past two years. Benson
taught filmmaking there and made the movie ``Modern Love'' in
Columbia, using students and local professionals.
   The actor of such films as ``Tribute,'' ``One on One'' and ``The
Chosen'' could not be reached for comment, but he said last week he
resigned ``the second Dr. Holderman did'' and that he would be
moving to Los Angeles this month.

   Onetime New York City limousine king William
Fugazy was ordered to pay billionaire John Kluge $46.6 million for
lying about the car company's worth before selling it.
   A Manhattan jury decided Wednesday in favor of Kluge and awarded
him more than $15.5 million in damages. Under the state's civil
racketeering law, the award was tripled by U.S. District Judge
Robert Carter.
   Kluge, owner of Metromedia Co., bought Fugazy Express car service
in 1985 and sued two years later, claiming Fugazy lied about the
company's finances.
   Fugazy, who said he would appeal, accused Kluge of mismanaging
the company into bankruptcy. He said he remained mystified by the
suit.
   ``He and I were friends,'' Fugazy said. ``I guess that's the way
it goes. I don't know what he was mad at.''
   Metromedia attorney Arnold Wadler called the verdict ``fabulous''
and said Kluge was ``very satisfied.''
   Kluge already has been awarded $4 million in damages from other
lawsuits stemming from the sale.

   Whoever coined the phrase ``It's a dog's
life'' probably had no idea just how good it could be.
   Max Felberbaum, a tuxedo-clad bichon frise, certainly does. The
dog was one of an elite group of party animals who gathered
Wednesday for a lawn party in this upscale suburb.
   Unruffled by his trip from Manhattan, Max joined Sparky
Duberstein, Bibi Walker and several other close friends _ all the
same breed _ at the first birthday party of Bonnie and Clyde Frankel.
   While their masters sipped champaign and nibbled turkey
sandwiches, the dogs savored meatball-shaped morsels on baked
biscuits and heart-shaped cookies. A cake resembling a bone took a
few wallops from a hammer to convert into bite-sized portions.
   President Bush's Aunt Mary Walker, who accompanied her dog, Bibi,
pronounced the event a success.
   ``Well, it was just perfectly lovely. I've never been to a party
like this before,'' she said. ``It's a really wonderful idea. It's
so adorable.''
   Some dogs arrived in limousines, and at least one wore what
appeared to be a diamond-studded collar.
   ``Of course it's real,'' a guest remarked.
   Barbara Frankel, the hostess, admitted that some might find the
gathering odd. ``You can imagine my friends think I'm certifiable,
but it makes me happy,'' she said.
   As for next year's party, Bambi Felberbaum, Max's master, said:
``I think for the second anniversary we'll have to fly them to
Paris. It's very chic to bring your dog to a restaurant in Europe.''

<HEAD>Study: Electrical Stimulation Devices No Better for Back Pain Than
Placebo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM KLAHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lower back pain is better remedied by a good
stretch than expensive electronic gadgetry, according to a study
published Thursday
   The results of the study indicate that widely used transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation, or TENS, appears to be no more
effective than a placebo, said Dr. Richard A. Deyo, lead author of
the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   ``It appeared to do nothing in our study. It was a resounding
negative result,'' the University of Washington researcher told
reporters Wednesday.
   A major manufacturer of the devices, Empi Corp. of St. Paul,
Minn., criticized the study, saying the 30-day length was not long
enough.
   ``Other studies done over a longer time frame have reinforced our
belief that TENS devices are an effective, low-cost alternative to
narcotic drug therapy and surgery for many pain sufferers,'' Donald
Maurer, Empi chairman, said.
   TENS units _ about the size of a personal cassette player _ are
carried on the belt. They include wires with electrodes placed on
the skin in the area of pain. Deyo said they cost about $500 and
have been used for about 20 years.
   He said use of TENS resulted from the belief that
counterstimulation of the nervous system could modify perception of
pain, like rubbing a bump on the head.
   It was later believed that TENS' low-frequency, high-amplitude
electrical stimulation could raise the level of opiatelike
substances, endorphins, in the spinal fluid.
   But little clinical evidence existed on the machines'
effectiveness. The researchers, who also included doctors at the
University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, ran
clinical tests using 145 patients with chronic back pain from 1985
to 1987 in San Antonio.
   They were broken into four groups: TENS plus exercise, TENS
alone, exercise with sham TENS, and sham TENS alone.
   All four groups reported significant improvement after two and
four weeks of participation, but had relapsed by the two-month
follow-up.
   ``There were no clinically important or statistically significant
differences in any outcome between the subjects receiving true TENS
and those receiving sham TENS,'' the study concluded.
   ``By contrast, the analysis of the effects of exercise showed an
advantage of exercise in several outcomes,'' including reduction in
reported frequency of pain.
   Deyo's advice: ``Try exercise first, and be persistent.'' He said
those working at exercise to help chronic back pain should expect no
quick fixes but should see improvements over time.
   He also advised against surgery for muscle-oriented pain, and
against powerful medications.
   He said TENS may be effective for acute pain or pain in other
parts of the body. But he said he hoped the research would prompt
others to study the TENS' effectiveness.
   The study said Americans spend $13 billion each year on lower
back pain treatments. Athough no estimate of national expenditures
for TENS is available, Deyo said the Veterans Administration in 1986
spent $2 million to purchase them.
   Deyo is director of health services research and development at
the Seattle Veterans Affairs Medical Center as well as a University
of Washington associate professor of medicine and health services.
   He said he expected a ``public relations-type'' assault against
the study, adding that a half-dozen manufacturers of TENS devices do
business in the United States.
   Others involved in the study included Dr. Nicholas Walsh,
chairman of the Department of Physical Medicine Rehabilitation at
the University of Texas; Dr. Donald Martin at the University of
Washington; and Drs. Lawrence Schoenfeld and Somayaji Ramamurthy at
the University of Texas.

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk's
lifting of the national state of emergency was welcomed Thursday by
world leaders but drew some domestic criticism for going too far _
or not far enough.
   The African National Congress, the black nationalist group that
has spearheaded the anti-apartheid movement, called the government
actions ``half measures.''
   Right-wing whites, on the other hand, intensified their
criticisms of de Klerk.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar called de Klerk's
move a ``positive development,'' and the White House hailed the move
as a sign of ``the remarkable progress'' being made in South Africa.
   De Klerk lifted the 4-year-old emergency in most of the country
but retained the rules in violence-torn Natal province and the Zulu
homeland.
   ANC leader Walter Sisulu said the state of emergency had done
nothing to stop the fighting in Natal. Sisulu told a news conference
that if de Klerk wants to create the right climate for negotiations
on ending apartheid, the emergency should be lifted in the troubled
eastern province as well.
   ``We are not asking for half measures,'' Sisulu said. ``What we
have asked for is to clear the atmosphere to negotiations. That was
not done.''
   Sisulu said Natal violence could be eased with the lifting of the
state of emergency and ``by the government taking positive steps to
prevent police brutality in the area.''
   In Paris, ANC leader Nelson Mandela also criticized the decision
to retain the state of emergency in Natal. He also said it was still
too early to end international sanctions against South Africa.
   Still, he called the lifting of the state of emergency a
``victory for the people ... both black and white.''
   About 4,000 blacks have died in violence in Natal during the past
four years. The main combatants are supporters of the ANC and
members of Inkatha, a relatively conservative Zulu organization.
   Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who heads the Zulu homeland
government, said it was ``lamentably tragic'' that the emergency
remained in force in Natal.
   ``I find it politically altogether unacceptable that I ... who
was among the first to declare his readiness to negotiate, now finds
himself locked into an emergency-ridden region,'' Buthelezi said.
   The ANC also wants the government to repeal security laws that
still allow detention without trial even though the emergency decree
has been lifted.
   ``Anyone of us in this room can be detained now,'' said ANC
official Mohammed Valli Moosa, who was detained three times during
the emergency. ``The de facto situation on the ground, in the
townships doesn't really change.''
   Meanwhile, the pro-apartheid Conservative Party said the end of
the emergency would lead to chaos elsewhere in the country.
   ``They (the government) couldn't cope with the violence even with
the state of emergency because they were not applying it,'' said
Moolman Mentz, a spokesman for the Conservatives. ``Our view is the
government is trying to appease everybody.''
   The South African Chamber of Business praised de Klerk's action,
calling it ``an important step toward national reconciliation.'' It
said stability was essential for business and investment in South
Africa.
   De Klerk wants to work out a new constitution with opposition
groups that will lead to power-sharing between the 5 million whites
and 28 million blacks, who currently have no voice in national
affairs.

   North Carolina led the nation in acts of
violence, vandalism and harassment against homosexuals in 1989, a
year during which such episodes were prevalent nationwide, according
to a survey of gay organizations.
   A total of 7,031 incidents of anti-gay violence or harassment
occurred last year in 40 states and the District of Columbia,
according to the report, ``Anti-Gay Violence, Victimization &amp;
Defamation in 1989.'' Of those, 1,204 took place in North Carolina,
the survey found.
   ``These attacks occurred in a context of widespread violence
against Jews, people of color and women,'' said Kevin Berrill, the
report's author and director of the anti-violence project at the
National Gay &amp; Lesbian Task Force.
   He cited the death of Yusuf Hawkins, a black youth killed by
whites in Brooklyn, N.Y.; the firebombing of the San Diego Jewish
Times; the beating death of an Asian in Raleigh, N.C.; and racist
bombings in Birmingham, Ala., and Savannah, Ga., that killed a
federal judge and a civil rights lawyer.
   ``Hate crimes exist because the narrow-minded and mean-spirited
among us have judged some of their fellow citizens to be less
deserving of respect than themselves,'' Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., said at a news conference to release the report. ``The
more that we bring these crimes to light, the less tolerable they
will be.''
   Berrill said anti-gay violence remains largely hidden. He said
gay people should report such crimes. He also called on more states
to pass hate crimes laws similar to the federal Hate Crimes
Statistics Act, signed in April by President Bush.
   The report said hate crime laws with anti-gay provisions recently
passed in California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Iowa,
Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oregon and Vermont. They also were adopted
in Atlanta, Burlington, Iowa; Montgomery County, Md.; and St. Louis,
the report said.
   In Durham, N.C., Jill Duvall, executive director of Gay &amp; Lesbian
Health Project, said she believed anti-gay incidents were on the
rise in part because of AIDS backlash. Nevertheless, she said, many
of the crimes go unreported in North Carolina because of the state's
sodomy law.
   ``Gay people are afraid to go to local police because of
treatment in the past. There have been people that have gone to
police stations that have been told they are breaking a felony''
statute, she said.
   The data for the survey came from questionnaires sent to 650 gay
activists and organizations nationwide. The task force acknowledged
its methods were unscientific, and noted that more than half the
groups that responded in 1988 did not do so in 1989. However, the
survey is designed to give a broad look at the prevalence of
anti-gay incidents.

<HEAD>Mandela Urges Continued Sanctions Despite End of State of Emergency</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Black leader Nelson Mandela said Thursday that
easing sanctions as a reward for the near-total lifting of South
Africa's state of emergency would be ``a stab in the back'' for the
anti-apartheid movement.
   Mandela, in Paris on the first stop of a six-week international
trip, said President F.W. de Klerk's decision to lift the emergency
in all but one province was ``a victory for all the people, black
and white.''
   But asked at a news conference if South Africa's government
should be rewarded by an easing of economic sanctions, Mandela
replied: ``That would be a grave mistake. It would be regarded by
the people of South Africa as a stab in back.''
   Mandela also expressed regret that the emergency remained in
force in Natal province, where black political factions have been
battling.
   One of the main purposes of Mandela's trip to Europe, the United
States and Canada is to urge Western leaders to maintain sanctions
despite de Klerk's reforms.
   The 71-year-old African National Congress leader, freed in
February after more than 27 years in prison, said French President
Francois Mitterrand assured him during private talks that France
would keep its sanctions in place.
   ``He made an unequivocal statement that the French government
supports sanctions until fundamental, irreversible changes take
place'' in South Africa, Mandela told scores of journalists covering
his first visit to France.
   According to French officials, Mandela urged Mitterrand during
their 30-minute meeting to lobby other European leaders to keep
existing sanctions in effect.
   Mandela and de Klerk have held preliminary negotiations aimed at
clearing away obstacles, including the state of emergency, so that
formal talks can begin on a new constitution that would extend
political rights to the black majority.
   During a meeting with Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac, a former
premier, Mandela said a new South African Constitution should not
entrench special legal protection for the white minority.
   ``Nowhere in Europe does one find this idea that the rights of a
particular minority must be safeguarded,'' Mandela said. ``Our
position is that what's good for Europe is good for us.''
   Mandela also met Thursday with Georges Marchais,
secretary-general of the French Communist Party, and with Premier
Michel Rocard.
   On Wednesday evening, Mitterrand and his wife, Danielle, joined
Mandela and his wife, Winnie, at an outdoor concert held in
Mandela's honor at the Place du Trocadero, across the Seine River
from the Eiffel Tower.
   The two couples stood shoulder to shoulder in the rain as an
ensemble of 100 white-jacketed violinists played ``God Bless
Africa,'' the anthem of the anti-apartheid movement.
   Mandela _ making his third and most extensive foreign trip since
his release from prison _ visits Switzerland next, followed by West
Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, Ireland and Great
Britain, as well as several African countries. He returns home July
18, his 72nd birthday.
   De Klerk, since taking office in August, has moved to dismantle
several segregation laws, lifted a 30-year ban on the African
National Congress and freed dozens of jailed ANC members, including
48 on Thursday.
   Mandela, however, contends that foreign pressure should be
maintained because de Klerk's government has not yet addressed the
black majority's basic demand of a one-person, one-vote political
system.
   De Klerk visted Mitterrand and other Western Euorpean leaders
during a nine-nation, 18-day trip last month. Mitterrand told de
Klerk the status of sanctions would be discussed at a European
Community summit meeting in Dublin, Ireland on June 25-26.

   Ivana Trump contributed her two cents Thursday to
save her husband's beleaguered empire.
   ``Hopefully it will bring us good luck,'' Mrs. Trump said with a
smile as she tossed her pennies into the newly restored fountain
outside the Plaza Hotel, which Trump owns and she runs. ``It can't
get much worse.''
   The Donald was one of the leading contributors to the privately
financed restoration of the Pulitzer Fountain and Grand Army Plaza
at the southeast corner of Central Park.
   Mrs. Trump appeared unannounced at the dedication ceremony to
accept a small plaque on her husband's behalf.
   Asked how her husband was doing in light of his highly publicized
cash-flow problems, Mrs. Trump replied, ``I don't know. You'll have
to ask him.''
   On Wednesday, she released a statement saying that despite their
recent marital problems, she planned to ``stand beside him through
thick or thin and for better or worse.''
   A few blocks down Fifth Avenue on Thursday, Trump almost managed
to slip by photographers staking out Trump Tower after someone
called news organizations saying he would offer to buy the Trump
Shuttle for $1.
   Trump got into a limousine and sped off.

<HEAD>Cheney Study of 25 Percent Force Cut Not A Budget Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney next week will
give budget negotiators a ``thumbnail sketch'' showing the effect
various defense cut proposals will have on the armed services, his
spokesman said Thursday.
   ``It's to help them focus ... on the budget debate,'' said
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams. ``It is not a budget offer, it's
not a recipe, it's not a plan'' for reductions in the nation's armed
forces.
   Cheney's study will begin with a look at a possible 25 percent
reduction in the armed forces over the next five fiscal years,
Williams said. He also will outline the effects of the far deeper
defense spending cuts sought by the House and Senate.
   The 25 percent force cut, Williams said, would be the kind of
``ballpark reduction'' that Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have been speaking about over the long
term as the defense budget is reduced.
   The Pentagon ``may well end up making those reductions in the
force'' over the years given the current drive to reduce spending,
Williams said, adding that such decisions had not been made.
   Defense experts on Capitol Hill have complained for months about
``blanks'' in Cheney's fiscal 1991 budget, pressing him to come up
with long-term spending needs so lawmakers can make decisions about
the administration's $303.3 billion spending proposal.
   Cheney met Wednesday with White House and congressional budget
negotiators who are trying to limit next year's budget deficit. They
said later that the report would produce figures to be used for
bargaining _ but was not an indication that such a cut was
inevitable.
   After that session, Cheney said he was sticking to the
administration's proposal to spend $303.3 billion for the military
in fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1. That's a slight increase over
the 1990 budget.
   Under the House-passed budget, defense spending would be limited
to $295.4 billion, while the Senate Budget Committee has approved a
$293.9 billion level.
   Cheney's report will examine a 25 percent reduction in forces,
``not a 25 percent reduction in budget,'' Williams said.
   ``It's intended to be a kind of a thumbnail sketch of the
possible outcome of the department's current six-year defense plan
reviews,'' he said.
   Budget negotiators want to limit next year's budget deficit to
$64 billion, the target set by the Gramm-Rudman law. The sessions so
far have focused on technical issues, and actual bargaining is at
least a week away.
   The administration says that unless steps are taken, that
shortfall could be as high as $206 billion this year. Failure to
come within $10 billion of the Gramm-Rudman target will trigger
automatic, across-the-board spending cuts in defense and most
domestic programs.

<HEAD>Red Army Terrorist Suspect Captured in East Berlin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities caught one of the most notorious
terrorist suspects in West German history and said Thursday she
lived for years as a homemaker in East Germany, perhaps with the
approval of the old Communist regime.
   East German authorities arrested Susanne Albrecht, 39, in front
of her apartment in East Berlin on Wednesday, ending a 13-year hunt
for a woman believed to be a key member of the leftist Red Army
Faction.
   The Red Army Faction is blamed for assassinations and arson and
bombing attacks in West Germany since the 1970s. The latest attack
in November killed the country's leading banker.
   Miss Albrecht has been accused in the 1977 slaying of Juergen
Ponto, the head of Dresdner Bank _ West Germany's second-largest.
She also has been linked to the kidnapping and murder that year of
wealthy industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer.
   Miss Albrecht did not resist arrest and was unarmed, Interior
Minister Peter-Michael Diestel said. She produced her
identification, which had the phony name of Ingrid Jaeger, he said.
   She also had a special travel visa that allowed her more travel
freedom than other East Germans under the former Communist regime,
he said.
   Diestel said Miss Albrecht had been a resident of East Berlin for
the past 10 years and was married to an East German man. He said she
had a child who apparently was born in East Berlin.
   She had been employed for the last two years as a laboratory
worker in another country but maintained a residence in East Berlin,
Diestel said.
   Chief Detective Wolfgang Pauleit told reporters he presumed that
she was on vacation from her job and returned because she wanted to
be in East Germany for the economic union with West Germany.
   Diestel would not give the age or gender of Miss Albrecht's child
or details about her husband, nor would he identify the country in
which she had been working.
   The West German tabloid Bild, in a report made available in
advance of publication Friday, said Miss Albrecht had been in the
Soviet Union and was an operative for East Germany's former secret
police. The newspaper gave no attribution.
   It said she was exposed when the vast files of the former secret
police network were examined by the country's new democratic
government.
   There has been much speculation about the wealth of information
in the 6 million secret police files, and whether there is proof
that the former Communist government sponsored leftist terrorism.
   Diestel said there was no evidence Miss Albrecht worked for the
secret police.
   But he said he could not rule out the possibility that she was
living in East Germany with the approval or knowledge of the
hard-line Communist government, which was ousted amid massive
pro-democracy protests in October.
   The Red Army Faction got its start with a series of arson and
bombing attacks in the early 1970s. Most were aimed at the U.S.
military for American involvement in Vietnam.
   About 25 Red Army Faction members were still being sought up to
the time of Albrecht's arrest.
   The latest attack claimed by the Red Army Faction was the Nov. 30
bombing death of Alfred Herrhausen, head of Deutsche Bank, West
Germany's largest commercial bank. He was killed when a bomb was
detonated under his armored car as he was being driven to work.

<TEXT>
   The nation's top health official portrayed
animal rights activists Thursday as ``terrorists'' and said their
tactics jeopardize the future of disease-curing experiments.
   ``Animal research has saved millions of human lives,'' said
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan. ``It is an
integral part of mankind's striving for the betterment of humanity.''
   ``I am saddened and a bit angry that we have to put up with major
disruptions to science by so-called animal activists who are, in
fact, nothing more than animal rights terrorists,'' he said.
   Animal rights activists, who plan to march Sunday in the nation's
capital, responded that Sullivan's remarks were ``appalling.'' They
said he was ignoring the continuing exploitation of laboratory
animals that suffer needlessly while alternative, non animal testing
methods are available.
   Sullivan was joined at a news conference by officials from the
Association of American Medical Colleges; actor David Birney, who is
a national spokesman for the American Diabetes Association; Rep. Vin
Weber, R-Minn.; and parents of children who have benefited from
medical procedures that evolved from animal experiments. Also
participating were representatives of the beef, dairy, poultry and
other industries dependent on animals.
   Sullivan said that ``virtually everyone agrees that unnecessary
animal research or the cruel use of animals is wrong.''
   He added, however, that the federal government has in place
regulations that ensure that research animals are treated humanely
``and that we do everything possible to reduce any pain or
discomfort'' that results from experiments. He said cruel treatment
of animals by research scientists was ``very rare.''
   Birney, who played the role of a doctor on the television series
``St. Elsewhere,'' ticked off a list of medical advances that have
resulted from animal research, including insulin for diabetics,
antibiotics, organ transplants, drug therapies and skin grafts.
   ``Without animal research, many of us in this room would be
dead,'' he said.
   Len Koch, chairman of the Incurably Ill for Animal research, said
the activists used ``lies, distortion and misinformation,'' to wage
a sophisticated campaign that is costing taxpayers millions of
dollars.
   Medical schools are spending about $6 million a year for damage
to labs attacked by animal rights protesters and additional security
to prevent further disruption of their experiments, said Dr. L.
Thompson Bowles, an official of the Association of American Medical
Colleges.
   The annual cost to the federal government is about $12 million,
said Dr. Frederick Goodwin, administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse
and Mental Health Administration.
   Rep. Weber said the issue is not about cruelty to animals but
about abuse and harassment of scientists conducting lifesaving
experiments.
   Animal rights groups constitute ``a strong, growing, powerful
political movement,'' he said. ``There is no political movement in
my judgment that more directly threatens the health and quality of
life of the American people in the 1990s than the animal rights
movement.''
   But Ingrid Newkirk, national director of the People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals, said statements by Sullivan the others
were ``appalling ... an attempt to gloss over all the exposes of
terrible cruelties, fraud and unnecessary use of animals'' in
research.
   ``I am morally opposed to the exploitation of any individual or
group of individuals who cannot fight for themselves,'' she said.
``And so I believe there is always a way if you look to get
information without using animals.''
   Neal Barnard, president of the Physicians Committee for
Responsible Medicine, said Sullivan was wrong in claiming animal
abuse in labs was rare. He pointed as an example to a $2.1 million
Army study in which 700 cats were shot in the head with bullets, and
a surgical company's practice of killing dogs to train its
salespeople how to use surgical staples.
   ``We are still dealing with the outer crust of cruelty and
waste,'' Barnard said. ``I would encourage (Sullivan) to deal with
the ugly cases that are still there.''
   Barnard said that among the alternatives to animal testing are
experiments in which cultures of human cells are grown in the
laboratory. Tests on these cells, though still imperfect, are faster
and more appropriate than testing with animals, he said.
   ``I'm concerned that Dr. Sullivan isn't thinking,'' he said. ``I
don't think he's looked at the opportunities for improvement.''

<HEAD>Some High-Tech Trade Restrictions Being Lifted for Eastern Europe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials from 17 Western nations agreed Thursday to
lift export restrictions on some high-technology products and opened
the way for preferential treatment for East European nations
previously denied access to Western technology.
   The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls _
known as COCOM _ agreed to delete 30 of 116 items from its
restricted list effective July 1, U.S. officials said. This will
make the items available to all nations, including the Soviet Union.
   COCOM will seek to eliminate eight more items by mid-August and
reduce restricted items to a ``core list'' of highly strategic items
by the end of the year.
   Delegates at the two-day meeting also agreed that East European
countries that adopt ``appropriate safeguards'' could become
eligible for preferential treatment.
   ``We believe these countries are future candidates for deletion
from the COCOM list of proscribed destinations,'' a U.S. statement
said.
   Allan Wendt, senior State Department representative for strategic
technology policy, said Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia would
likely be the first to benefit from a preferred status with the
group.
   East Germany, pending full political unification with West
Germany, will benefit from a ``greatly reduced list'' of export
controls and improved licensing protections, officials said.
   West Germany's Economics Ministry said the COCOM decisions
amounted to freeing ``all essential technologies for East Germany.''
   ``What we are doing is rewriting the COCOM controls from
scratch,'' said Wendt, who headed the U.S. delegation. ``It's a
tabla rasa approach.''
   The moves effectively modernize COCOM, which sets and oversees
export restrictions on Western technology with possible military
application. They also give a boost to the effort by East European
nations to modernize their economies.
   The decisions ``basically allow Eastern Europe to engage in
modernization across the board,'' said Dennis Kloske, undersecretary
of commerce for export administration and a member of the U.S.
delegation.
   Machine tools, telecommunications and computer equipment _ which
account for the bulk of COCOM cases _ are the ``bricks and mortars''
of modern economic society, Kloske said.
   The move to free access to a higher level of telecommunications
equipment came at the initiative of the United States, U.S.
officials said.
   Members of the U.S. delegation estimated that in reducing COCOM's
list of controlled items about $45 billion of U.S. exports alone
were eliminated from the licensing process.
   Among the safeguards required for nations like Poland, Hungary or
Czechoslovakia are guarantees the technology will be limited to
civilian use and that there will be no intelligence cooperation with
the Soviet Union aimed at diverting the technology in question,
Wendt said.
   Kloske said the moves amounted to a ``basic removal of 50 percent
of our licensing caseload.''
   President Bush called May 2 for modernization of COCOM following
the dramatic moves toward democratization in Eastern Europe.
   All COCOM members _ the NATO alliance minus Iceland, plus
Australia and Japan _ were pressing for decontrols.

<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from
President F.W. de Klerk's speech Thursday to Parliament, in which he
announced the lifting of the state of emergency in three of the
country's four provinces:
   There are today few or no restrictions on political activities in
our country ... Many organizations including the ANC, have now been
stripped of the mythological status which they previously enjoyed.
They now have to defend their policies in the open marketplace of
ideas. ...
   I announced (in April) a number of practical steps which the
government would take to strengthen the maintenance of law and
order, particularly in Natal. Those steps are, generally speaking,
indicating positive results. ...
   I have decided to announce that there will no longer be a general
countrywide state of emergency, but that henceforth it will exist in
Natal only. ... The increasing phenomenon in Natal of violence among
blacks, which has led to the destruction of human life and property
and has assumed shocking proportions, as well as the exceptionally
high level of intimidation that exists there, must still be
countered by the strongest means available. ...
   The government's decision (to lift the emergency) has nothing to
do with pressure from any quarter or with any wish to gain political
capital. We do not, and have never, regarded the state of emergency
as a political pawn. Nonetheless, the net result of the lifting of
the state of emergency is that one of the main stumbling blocks has
been removed. ...
   The government is already looking at aspects of security
legislation which could possibly inhibit the free conduct of
peaceful politics and which, because of the reduction in the violent
onslaught on the existing order, might no longer be necessary. ...
   Communication lines between the South African police and ANC
leaders have in the meantime also been established so that violence
and intimidation could be monitored and countered right down to
local level. ...
   We are not only talking. We are actually implementing in rapid
succession the steps we have envisaged. The process of building a
new South Africa has become irreversible. We are on the threshhold
of the real negotiation process and the time has come for other
important role players to do their bit. In particular, the ANC must
now stop vacillating. ...
   How can (ANC calls for peace) be reconciled with Mr. (Nelson)
Mandela's statement June 2 that: `The only sort of violence which we
accept is organized violence in the form of armed activity which is
properly controlled and where the target is carefully selected.' ...
   Exactly what targets has the ANC in mind? The same police force
which protected him and his colleagues during their recent visit to
Cape Town? The departments of the ministers with whom he and his
colleagues were discussing in the need for peaceful solutions? Their
political opponents in the homelands? ...
   Let bygones be bygones. Let us forget real or imagined injustices
of the past and create a new future for our children, free from
mistrust, prejudice and hatred and domination. ...

   The wife of U.S. hostage Thomas
Sutherland, who marks his fifth year in captivity Saturday, said she
does not bear a grudge against his Shiite Moslem kidnappers.
   ``I don't feel bitter. It doesn't do you any good ... to feel
bitter,'' Jean Sutherland said in an interview at her office on the
campus of the American University of Beirut.
   Mrs. Sutherland, 56, lives and works at the campus in Moslem west
Beirut, continuing the work she and her husband were doing before he
was kidnapped June 9, 1985.
   ``Tom and I are just ordinary people who came here to do a job.
The job is still there and we're still doing it and we just have to
hang tough as long as we have to,'' she said.
   ``I was just determined that the continuity should go ahead, that
there shouldn't be changes,'' she added. ``This has been
tremendously rewarding for me.''
   Scottish-born Sutherland, 59, of Fort Collins, Colo., is the
second longest-held hostage in Lebanon. He was dean of agriculture
at the university when he was kidnapped on the airport highway a few
minutes after he returned from a visit to the United States.
   In addition to Sutherland, 15 other Westerners are missing in
Lebanon, including five Americans.
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, is the longest held. Anderson was kidnapped in Beirut on
March 16, 1985.
   Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, the pro-Iranian Shiite group
that holds Sutherland, has never issued a photo of him. The only
word on his welfare has come from former hostages who had been held
with him.
   Mrs. Sutherland, a tall woman with short, dark gray hair, never
loses her smile even when she talks about the pain of her husband's
captivity.
   She is known among her colleagues as a strong, determined woman
who spends most of her time at work, teaching English for beginners.
In her free time she jogs, plays tennis and walks.
   Mrs. Sutherland said she has not changed anything in her house
since her husband was abducted.
   ``If Tom walked through the door today, the house would look just
as though he left yesterday. Maybe that's part of what you do to
make do and keep going. In our situation, I never count days or
hours or weeks or years,'' she said.
   Mrs. Sutherland described the house, on campus and overlooking
the Mediterranean, as ``very welcoming. It's something that
refreshes the spirit.
   ``There's so much activity on the campus green that even if I'm
at home on my own I never feel alone,'' she said.
   The Sutherlands have three daughters, Ann, 32; Kit, 30; and Joan,
26. They all live and work in the United States.
   Sutherland has never seen his only granddaughter, Simone, 3. She
was born to Ann after his abduction.
   Mrs. Sutherland has a gardener _ ``one of my luxuries'' _ who
tends the flowering trees, jasmin and gardenias.
   She moves freely around Beirut, doing her shopping and going out
to dinner without feeling afraid.
   ``People are really nice to me. Nobody has ever threatened me. I
never feel it,'' she said.
   ``People live under such awful conditions here and you're really
at essence, you're down to the basics. What you find is that people
come together and interact.
   ``Human relationships become the most precious thing you've got.''

   Federal investigators who found 15,000
violations of child labor laws during a three-day nationwide sweep
in March followed with a surprise one-day effort this week, the
Labor Department said Thursday.
   The nearly 1,000 enforcement officials who fanned out across the
country Wednesday did not immediately report the number of
violations they uncovered at nearly 1,900 businesses, the department
said.
   During the March sweep, agents visited mostly fast-food
restaurants, grocery stores and other service businesses that employ
large numbers of youngsters.
   This week's effort was broadened to include agriculture workers
and the garment industry, officials said.
   ``We're trying to see if the problem is pervasive or if it is
just in the metropolitan areas,'' said Johanna Schneider, a Labor
Department spokesman.
   The majority of the alleged violations uncovered in March
involved firms in which 14- and 15-year-olds worked more hours or
later at night during the school week than allowed under federal law.
   But there were also hundreds of youngsters, mostly 16- and
17-year-olds, who were performing dangerous tasks or using hazardous
equipment such as power-driven meat-slicing machinery, dough mixers
and paper-balers.
   Of the 3,900 businesses visited in March, nearly half were in
apparent violation of child labor laws, officials said.
   After the March blitz, investigators first reported 7,000
violations, but the total rose to 15,500 after further reviews of
payroll records, the Labor Department said.
   Fines stemming from the March sweep are expected to total $5
million, up from the original estimate of $1.8 million in fines, the
agency said.
   Last year, the Labor Department's wage and hour division, which
enforces child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act,
found 22,508 minors to be illegally employed, an all-time high.
Fines totaling $2.7 million were assessed during all of 1989.
   On Friday, a House panel will continue hearings into child labor
violations. Those scheduled to testify include parents of youngsters
killed on the job. Officials from Burger King, McDonald's and
Domino's pizza are also scheduled to appear.
   Federal law forbids 14- and 15-year-olds from working more than
three hours on a school day or 18 hours in a week during the school
year. Eight hours is permitted on weekend days and 40-hour weeks are
permitted in summer and during vacations.
   Youngsters under 14 are prohibited from working in all but a few
exempt jobs, such as newspaper delivery workers.

   Americans took out just $584 million more in
consumer credit than they paid off in April, a sharp slowdown
resulting from slackened demand for new automobiles, the government
said Thursday.
   The Federal Reserve said consumer credit increased at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.0 percent, down from a 4.0
percent growth rate the previous month.
   Consumers, who account for about two-thirds of all economic
activity, have been selective in their buying recently as the
economy slowed because of the Fed's tight-credit policy designed to
stem inflation.
   Spending on services generally continues to be brisk, but
expenditures for big-ticket goods that are purchased with loans have
flagged.
   Gilbert Benz, an economist with the Swiss Bank Corp. in New York,
said consumers are becoming less interested in taking on new debt
both because of the amount they already hold and because of high
interest rates.
   In a possible reflection of future spending, the Conference Board
reported on Monday that its index of consumer confidence dropped to
106.7 in May from 107.3 in April.
   Some analysts question whether the Fed report accurately reflects
the amount of consumer debt since people have other ways of
borrowing, such as home equity loans, that are not included in the
survey.
   Automobile loans in April fell $2.5 billion, a 10.3 percent
annual rate of decline, after gaining 7.5 percent in March.
   Automakers had reported a sharp drop in sales in April, a trend
that began in the final quarter of last year and continued in May.
   Credit card debt increased by a brisk $2.4 billion, an annual
rate of 14.0 percent, after rising 10.2 percent the previous month.
   But Benz said much of the gain was due to Easter sales and does
not represent a trend.
   ``You'll probably see it pull back down the road,'' he said.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose $735
million, a 4.3 percent annual rate, after falling 6.9 percent in
March.
   Borrowing for mobile homes was off $8 million, a 0.4 percent
annual rate of decline, after gaining 4.1 percent a month earlier.
   ``This supports what we were looking for in terms of the
construction sector, that there is a lot of weakness not only in the
commercial but in the residential sector as well,'' Benz said.
   Manufacturing and housing have been the sectors of the economy
hardest hit by the Fed's tight-money policy.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at the end of April
at $720.9 billion.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Votes to Slash Additional Funds for Moscow Embassy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A Senate panel voted Thursday to slash an
administration request for additional money to tear down and rebuild
the new U.S. Embassy in Moscow, which is riddled with electronic
listening devices.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 15-0 for an
amendment offered by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to cut
the $270 million figure the State Department had asked for the
coming year to $50 million.
   The vote was largely symbolic because it came on legislation that
is unlikely to be enacted into law.
   However, it illustrated the continuing controversy over what to
do with the eight-story structure, suffused with Soviet listening
technology, on which the government already has spent $60 million.
   Both Democrats and Republicans on the panel, arguing in support
of Moynihan's move, said it would be a waste to tear down an nearly
completed building that could be used for other purposes for which
Soviet eavesdropping would not be a problem.
   Moynihan argued that the $50 million he left in the bill would be
enough to complete the compromised chancery building and construct a
smaller building elsewhere in the Embassy compound to house
sensitive intelligence and other secret operations.
   That idea is vigorously opposed by the State Department, which
wants to tear the chancery down to its foundation and rebuild it for
its originally planned use as the primary office building for the
complex.
   Intelligence experts, including the Senate Intelligence
Committee, have endorsed that approach as the only secure one.
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee, in a separate version of the
legislation, has included the full $270 million but left open the
question of whether it would be spent on a new building or
reconstructing the present one.
   The skirmish over the Embassy building came on a measure sought
by the administration that also would authorize spending $474
million to pay past-due dues to the United Nations.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., signaled that if the measure comes to
the Senate floor he would seek to delete that money from the bill.
   In addition, the measure included a series of add-ons, most from
Democrats, to address pet concerns. The provisions included $7.4
million sought by Moynihan to control sea lampreys and zebra mussels
in the Great Lakes.

   A top State Department official met Thursday
with China's ambassador amid reports that China has helped Libya
develop chemical weapons.
   Richard Boucher, the department's spokesman, said he didn't know
whether Lawrence Eagleburger, the deputy secretary of state, planned
to bring up the issue of chemical weapons in his talks with Chinese
Ambassador Zhu Qizhen.
   However, Boucher said, ``We have met with the Chinese recently on
the subject of chemical weapons proliferation.''
   Eagleburger, who is the State Department's No. 2 man and runs the
agency in Baker's absence, traveled twice to China last year on
secret missions in the aftermath of China's crackdown on
pro-democracy dissidents. Eagleburger accompanied National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft on the trips.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Solomon said on Capitol Hill
Wednesday that ``there have been some indications'' the Chinese are
involved with chemical weapons.
   ``We have expressed our concerns to the Chinese at a very high
level,'' he said.
   Boucher refused to elaborate on the reports, but a congressional
source, who spoke only on condition that he not be identified, said
there were reports that China may be selling chemicals to Libya.

   A toddler ripped from his mother's arms by a
tornado was laid to rest Thursday with his teddy bear sharing his
blue metal coffin.
   ``Today we are in grief, we are in sorrow, we are in a comforting
state to the family because this child left us in the morning hours
of life,'' the Rev. Elliott Perry said in his eulogy for
15-month-old Benjamin R. Ray.
   ``But God is not in the business of sorrow. God is in the
business of comfort.''
   Tim and Donna Ray were trying to carry their four children into
the back bedroom of their mobile home when the tornado hit Saturday
night. The twister demolished the trailer and ripped Benjamin and
his sisters from their parents' grasp.
   Benjamin was the only Bedford resident among 10 Indiana residents
killed during weekend storms that swept through Indiana.
   Before the service began, Ray stood before the casket on crutches
with his sister, Kelli Jaggers. He suffered a broken left leg in the
storm. Mrs. Ray, her face still gashed and bruised, was nearby.
   The Rays' oldest child, Jenny, 7, remained in stable condition at
Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, where she was being treated for
severe head injuries.
   At the funeral were 6-year-old Abby, who was released from the
hospital Thursday, and 3-year-old Melissa, who was released earlier
in the week.
   Along with the teddy bear, a white handkerchief on little
Benjamin's body was embroidered with the words, ``Thank heaven for
little boys.'' A blue satin pillow on top of the casket read,
``Brother.''
   After having three daughters, the Rays continued to have children
because they wanted a son, said the children's great aunt, Geneva
Speer.
   ``They had three girls and wanted a boy so bad,'' she said.
``They really couldn't afford to have all them kids, but they kept
having them until they got them a boy.''

   Britain's foreign secretary, Douglas
Hurd, said Thursday ``a tremor of danger'' was running through the
Middle East and urged the United States to try to bring peace to the
troubled region.
   Hurd said he discussed his anxieties about the Middle East with
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III at a meeting of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization in Turnberry, about 50 miles southwest
of Glasgow.
   The foreign secretary said he urged Baker to maintain his
interest in the peace process and ``found he remained actively
interested, which is crucial.''
   Hurd termed an attempt by Palestinian gunmen on May 30 to
infiltrate a Tel Aviv beach ``clearly a reverse for the
Palestinians.''
   He told reporters, ``The tremor of danger running through the
area is clear.''
   ``The peace process has taken a step backwards in the last few
weeks. It is important it should not be lost.''
   The United States has denounced the raid, which Israel foiled.
Baker has not said whether U.S. talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which began in December 1988 after PLO chief Yasser
Arafat renounced terrorism, would be continued.
   Hurd recently returned from a trip to the Middle East.

<HEAD>Bipartisan Aviation Funding Bill Introduced In House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of a House committee introduced a
bipartisan bill Thursday to pay for improvements in the nation's air
travel system without tax increases or fees proposed by the Bush
administration.
   The plan by the Democratic and Republican leadership of the House
Public Works and Transportation Committee calls for spending $17.7
billion over the next two fiscal years, which is close to what
President Bush has requested.
   But a large share of the money would come from the Aviation Trust
Fund, which has accumulated $7.6 billion from passenger fees and
other tax revenue. Bush wants new airport passenger fees and
increased federal ticket taxes and taxes on aviation fuel.
   The House aviation subcommittee is scheduled to take up the bill
June 14.
   ``We are proposing to authorize this funding that will benefit
all airline passengers without a federal tax increase,'' said Rep.
Glenn M. Anderson, D-Calif., committee chairman.
   Other bill sponsors include the committee's ranking Republican,
Rep. Paul Hammerschmidt of Arkansas, along with the chairman and
ranking minority member of the aviation subcommittee, Reps. James L.
Oberstar, D-Minn., and William F. Clinger Jr., R-Pa.
   Oberstar said the measure would reduce money in the trust fund to
$1.2 billion by fiscal 1995.
   ``We see no ned for a federal tax increase for aviation while we
have a $7.6 billion surplus in the trust fund,'' Oberstar said.
   He said the committee's plan envisions expansion of the nation's
aviation capacity through ``airport development, modernization of
the air traffic control system and improved system operations.''
   The bill would authorize $1.8 billion in fiscal 1991 and $1.9
billion in fiscal 1992 for the airport improvement program and $2.5
billion in 1991 and $3 billion in 1992 for aviation facilities and
equipment. It also would authorize $4.1 billion for operation in
1991, about half of which would come from the trust fund. In fiscal
1992, that would increase to $4.4 billion.
   The bill would eliminate penalty clauses applying to the trust
fund that are designed to ensure that the greater share of the fund
be spent for capital improvements rather than operation of the
Federal Aviation Administration. The clauses limit the proportion of
funding that can go to operations.

<HEAD>U.S. Companies Join Soviets to Improve Health Care</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of U.S. health-care companies have
joined Soviet officials to create a program that will share
technology and research to improve care for children in both
countries.
   Officials of Children's Health System Inc., based in Norfolk,
Va., said Thursday the agreement with the Soviet Ministry of Health
would help meet that country's needs for medical supplies, drugs,
technology and advanced training.
   The agreement was signed last month in Moscow, where two Eastern
Virginia Medical School pediatricians who represented Children's
Health System toured Moscow's leading pediatric hospitals.
   Drs. Raymond D. Adelman and Rebecca L. Byrd said the Soviet
facilities were 10 to 15 years out of date and in urgent need of
medical supplies, equipment and drugs.
   U.S. physicians, Adelman said, will benefit by learning about
some of the new techniques and procedures the Soviets have perfected.
   About 90 percent of the patients in Soviet pediatric hospitals
would be treated as outpatients in the U.S. health care system.
   However, because of a shortage of medical specialists and
services in many areas of the Soviet Union, children must travel
hundreds of miles for appropriate care.
   One public health problem facing the Soviets is that many
families refuse to have their children immunized because of the
possibility they will contract AIDS, Byrd said.
   Unlike the United States where disposable syringes are used,
Soviet physicians use reusable syringes, which if not sterilized can
transmit blood-borne diseases, she said.
   The exchange, to be funded with donations from corporations and
foundations, will begin in September and will start with a few
physicians and other health care professionals in each country,
Adelman said.
   He said the Soviet health care system cannot improve dramatically
without adequate supplies of medical equipment and improvement in
basic technology.
   The exchange program, called the US-USSR Children's Health
Center, will work with Soviet authorities to facilitate the sale of
American medical supplies, drugs and technologies, he said.
   The Children's Health System network is anchored by Children's
Hospital of The King's Daughters, a non-profit, specialized
pediatric hospital in Norfolk.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Playboy Model Guilty of Tax Evasion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former Playboy model was convicted Thursday of
failing to pay taxes on almost $400,000 she got from an elderly
millionaire who allegedly paid her and her twin sister for
companionship or sex.
   The jury deliberated about 3{ hours before finding Leigh Ann
Conley, 35, guilty on four misdemeanor counts of failing to file
federal income tax returns on about $398,000.
   The conviction came a month after her twin, Lynnette Harris, was
found guilty of evading taxes on $686,000 she received from the same
suburban Milwaukee businessman, the late David Kritzik of Shorewood.
   The identical blonde twins appeared nude in Playboy magazine and
in two films, ``I, the Jury,'' and ``Sorceress'' before joining
three other young women in befriending Kritzik, who died last summer
at age 89.
   In Ms. Harris' trial, the government alleged the money she
received from Kritzik was in exchange for sex. In Ms. Conley's case,
prosecutors charged she accepted the money in exchange for her
companionship rather than for sex.
   Ms. Conley, who could be sentenced to four years in prison and
fined $325,000, said she believed the jury in her trial was
``totally biased because of my sister's case. I couldn't get a fair
trial.''
   Defense attorney Aaron Starobin said Thursday's verdict would be
appealed. ``My feeling is the hype this case received made it very
difficult for the jury to separate the law and facts from the
emotion,'' Starobin said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mel Johnson, the prosecutor in both
cases, said he was satisfied with the verdicts.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Curran scheduled sentencing for Ms.
Conley for Aug. 29.
   Ms. Harris, who is to be sentenced July 25, could receive a
maximum of 12 years in prison and fines totaling $625,000. The
guilty verdict in her case also will be appealed, her lawyer said.
   In closing arguments, Johnson described Kritzik as a millionaire
who ``craved the company of young women and was willing to pay for
it. He wanted a relationship with Ms. Conley, he paid for it and he
got it.''
   ``There isn't one single witness the government brought that said
they could show there was a service contract,'' Starobin said.
``There was a good relationship, a happy relationship for both of
them. He wanted her to be happy, and he had the ability.''
   He argued the money was given as a gift and did not constitute
income. The prosecution countered that Kritzik never designated the
money as a gift on his tax forms.
   Kritzik founded General Merchandise Co. in the 1930s. The company
grew to become one of the largest mail order companies in the world.
   He sold the company to J.C. Penny Co. in 1962 for $11 million.

<HEAD>Witnesses Say Veterans Waiting Too Long for Assistance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veterans are waiting months for wheelchairs,
artificial limbs or even eyeglasses because veterans hospitals must
borrow money from medical device accounts to meet other costs,
according to congressional testimony Thursday.
   The diversion is necessary because of chronic funding shortages
in VA hospitals, witnesses told the Senate Veterans Affairs
Committee.
   The committee has been examining the Veterans Affairs
Department's prosthetics and rehabilitation programs for months,
conducting its own investigation.
   Prosthetics is the term for a wide range of medical devices,
including artificial limbs, wheelchairs, bathtub grab bars, canes
for the blind, glasses and hearing aids, and such basic items as
stump socks.
   Close to 1 million of the nation's 28 million veterans receive
prosthetic devices from the VA at a cost of $100 million each year.
Veterans receive them because of injuries received during military
service. Poor veterans may receive them even though the disability
wasn't acquired as a result of service.
   According to Thursday's testimony, management of the program is
fragmented. One of the problems is that the directors of the VA's
172 medical centers control local spending.
   Witnesses inside and outside of the VA pointed to a lack of
centralized funding, a lack of cost accounting, overpayments of up
to $1,000 for local purchases, and a lack of inventory control at
local hospitals as well as the VA's central supply depot in Denver.
   Local medical directors ``are trying to make everything happen''
with limited funds, forcing them to juggle accounts, said Frederick
Downs Jr., VA's director of prosthetics and sensory aids services.
   Local veterans tend not to complain too loudly for fear of
getting even less service, so they resort to making small purchases
on their own, he said. ``They just want to get by.''
   But veterans groups said there are real problems:
   _The blind rehabilitation center at Westhaven, Conn., has more
than 200 veterans on its waiting list;
   _The Minneapolis medical center has only $36,000 in its
prosthetics account for the rest of the fiscal year because $276,000
was diverted for operating shortfalls;
   _Veterans are waiting up to three months for hearing aids and
wheelchairs, 60 days for a simple pair of eyeglasses, the American
Legion says.
   The VA's Inspector General, Renald P. Morani, said the District
of Columbia medical center spent $2,300 for a brace that could have
been obtained for less than $1,400.
   Morani's office has conducted numerous audits of the prosthetics
programs and is currently undertaking a new one. Deputy VA Secretary
Anthony J. Principi acknowledged problems and said the VA would
undertake immediate steps to correct problems outlined by a
management task force. He also plans to form an advisory committee.

   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole has met with
both sides in the three-month-old Greyhound strike but has no plans
to intervene in the dispute, now tied up in bankruptcy courts, a
Labor Department spokeswoman said Thursday.
   Mrs. Dole met Thursday with Edward M. Strait, president of the
Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions.
   Last week, the labor secretary met with Fred Currey, chairman of
Greyhound Lines Inc., at Currey's request, said Dale Tate, a
spokeswoman for Mrs. Dole.
   ``It was basically a courtesy call,'' Ms. Tate said of Currey's
meeting with Mrs. Dole.
   Union leaders representing the 6,300 striking drivers were
invited following the Currey visit, Ms. Tate said. It was an
informational session like the Currey meeting, she said.
   Mrs. Dole does not plan to intervene but is keeping on top of any
progress being made by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service, Ms. Tate said. Bargaining talks have not been held since
early May.
   Last year, Mrs. Dole won praise from organized labor when she
appointed a ``super mediator'' to help settle the bitter Pittston
coal strike affecting Appalachia miners.
   Greyhound, which lost $56 million in the first three months of
1990, filed for court protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
the federal bankruptcy laws on Monday so that buses can continue
operating through the peak summer season.
   On Thursday in Brownsville, Texas, a bankruptcy judge gave the
bus line permission to keep paying operating expenses so buses could
keep rolling. He also ordered the establishment of a creditors'
committee in time for a second hearing June 28.

<DATELINE>ROANOKE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A father accused of sexual abuse in one of
the nation's longest and most highly publicized child custody
battles said Thursday he should have ``backed away'' from the bitter
fight years ago.
   ``I would frankly like nothing more than to de-escalate the
fight,'' Eric Foretich said in an interview on radio station WFIR.
   Foretich, speaking from his office in Falls Church, Va., said he
opposes his former wife Elizabeth Morgan's attempt to gain custody
of their daughter, but has filed no formal custody request for the
girl himself.
   Ms. Morgan spent more than two years in prison in Washington
rather than surrender their daughter, Hilary, for court-ordered
visits with Foretich.
   Ms. Morgan accused Foretich of sexually abusing the girl.
Foretich denies the charge in the custody battle that began when the
girl, now 7, was a toddler.
   ``Sexual abuse has become the nuclear bomb in child custody
cases,'' Foretich said in the radio interview. ``When allegations
are made against a man, some fathers will back away and give up just
because the allegation is enough to taint their life and livlihood.''
   ``I wish I had backed away a long time ago, because it has not
really helped my practice or my daughter, either,'' said Foretich,
who is an oral surgeon.
   Hilary lives in New Zealand with her maternal grandparents. Ms.
Morgan has filed for permanent residency and custody there.
   ``I am not going to subject my daughter to another media
go-around, to litigation in New Zealand that would be purposeless,''
Foretich said.
   Foretich has said he would continue to fight his wife's custody
petition in the New Zealand courts because it would deny him access
to the girl.
   ``I would like nothing more than for her to have the chance to be
a child again. If that means I see less of her I can accept that
very painful decision on my part,'' Foretich said. ``I just don't
see how it's in her interests to have her whole life encumbered by
this.''

<TEXT>
   A young beauty queen charged with strangling
a woman in a jealous rage plotted the killing because she was
obsessed by her love for a dairy farmer, a prosecutor told jurors
Thursday.
   In opening arguments, District Attorney Greg Grau said he'll
prove Lori Esker planned a ``mission of secrecy'' when she left her
college campus to confront a former classmate who she thought had
stolen her boyfriend.
   Ms. Esker, a 20-year-old student at University of Wisconsin-River
Falls, is on trial on a murder charge in the death of Lisa Cihaski.
If convicted, she faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison.
   Grau contends that Ms. Esker strangled Ms. Cihaski with a belt on
Sept. 20 in a motel parking lot near Wausau.
   Ms. Esker, who was named Marathon County Dairy Princess in June
1989, resigned her title after she was charged in October.
   Grau said the plot was based on Ms. Esker's love for 25-year-old
Bill Buss, an Eland dairy farmer. The two dated for about a year
before Buss ended the relationship last summer, Grau said.
   Buss then began dating Ms. Cihaski, 21, of Birnamwood, and
friends said the couple were soon to become engaged.
   Grau said he would prove Ms. Esker ``had a near obsession with
trying to get Bill Buss back,'' including making repeated sexual
advances, in the months before Ms. Cihaski was slain.
   ``He (Buss) is going to tell you he resisted those advances
despite her persistence,'' the prosecutor said. ``Ladies and
gentlemen I think the evidence will show that on September 20 Lori
Esker left River Falls, Wisconsin, on a mission of secrecy.''
   Jurors were selected from Forest County, about 100 miles from
Wasau, because of pretrial publicity.
   According to court records, Ms. Esker told investigators she
grabbed a belt and strangled Ms. Cihaski as the two argued in a car
about Buss. She said she was acting in self-defense.
   Ms. Esker, a junior at the university majoring in agricultural
journalism, was free and staying at her parents' dairy farm after
the family put up $100,000 in property as bail.

   Romania must spend more than $25
million for emergency repairs from last week's earthquake that
killed 14 people and injured about 1,000 across central and eastern
Europe, an official said Thursday.
   The government also appealed for foreign help in making this
earthquake-prone country better equipped to handle temblors.
   Mihai Grigoriu, a top official in the Economy Ministry, said last
week's quake carved a trail of damage through 14 of Romania's 40
counties, including the capital city of Bucharest.
   Grigoriu said experts started examining the damaged buildings in
Romania and noticed most older structures that were damaged in major
quakes in 1977 and 1986 were also battered by the latest temblor.
   The earthquake and its aftershocks May 30-31 did major damage at
400 schools, 200 hospitals, as well as many city halls in Bucharest
and other communities across this Balkan nation of 23 million
people, Grigoriu said.
   The Uppsala Seismological Center in Sweden said the quake was
centered about 63 miles under the Earth, causing tremors to be felt
in Bulgaria, Soviet Moldavia, Yugoslavia and Turkey. It registered
up to 6.8 on the Richter scale.
   Apart from damage to buildings, Romania's $25 million loss also
includes export goods such as tons of wood, glass and tiles,
Grigoriu told The Associated Press.
   ``We could have well exported these materials to the West or to
Asia for hard currency,'' he said.
   Officials have given no estimate for costs other than urgently
needed repairs.
   Although no buildings collapsed, chunks of concrete fell from
high-rise buildings on virtually every street in the capital.
   In the city above the earthquake's epicenter, Focsani, about 190
miles northeast of Bucharest, 500 apartments were damaged, and
people were evacuated from four blocks of apartment buildings,
Grigoriu said.
   Eugen Ionescu, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
told a news conference Thursday the Romanian government would accept
offers from other governments or international groups on improving
its ability to handle earthquakes.
   Romania has a long history of damaging earthquakes, with three or
four major quakes a century, according to official statistics. More
than 1,500 Romanians died in the 1977 quake.
   The government has asked local groups in Romania to make up a
list of pre-World War II buildings at high risk of collapsing in the
next major quake.
   Officials will then decide on the demolition of those buildings
that ``are not worth any more money invested or are not worth being
repaired,'' Grigoriu said.

<HEAD>ConAgra To Buy Beatrice Co.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ConAgra Inc. has agreed to buy Beatrice Co.
for $1.34 billion in cash and stock, the two food giants announced
Thursday.
   The deal completes the breakup and sale of Beatrice _ owner of
such brand names as Hunt's, Wesson and and Reddi-Wip _ by the
investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   Kohlberg Kravis, bought Beatrice, then a major part of a huge
foods and consumer products conglomerate, in 1986 for $6.1 billion
in what was then the biggest leveraged buyout ever. The term
leveraged buyout refers to purchasing a company with borrowed cash;
corporations bought in this way often are broken up and sold to
repay the loan and make a profit.
   Since the buyout, Beatrice has sold off most of its businesses,
but still retains such well-known food brands as Hunt's, Wesson,
Manwich, Peter Pan, Snack Pak, Swiss Miss, La Choy, Swift Premium,
Butterball, Eckrich, and Reddi-Wip.
   ConAgra, an Omaha-based diversified food company with annual
sales of more than $15 billion, sells fozen foods with such labels
as Healthy Choice, Banquet, Morton, and Chun King, as well as Armour
processed meats and Country Pride chicken products. ConAgra also
sells fertilizer, animal feed and farm chemicals.
   ConAgra last year lost a bidding war for poultry processor Holly
Farms Corp. to Tyson Foods Inc.
   The Beatrice sale will be completed after federal government
review.
   The deal calls for ConAgra to buy Beatrice for $11.50 per share
from Kohlberg Kravis partnerships and management investors. Beatrice
would have 123.44 million shares outstanding, assuming all
outstanding warrants for purchase of Beatrice shares are exercised.
   The transaction would include approximately $626 million in cash
and $710 million in ConAgra stock.
   Henry Kravis, a founding partner of Kohlberg Kravis, said: ``Four
years ago, together with new management of Beatrice, we began the
process of reshaping Beatrice from a diverse conglomerate into a
focused and more profitable food company. ... Today's announcement
marks the successful completion of this process.''
   Beatrice formerly was one of the nation's biggest food and
consumer products conglomerates, owning product lines that included
Coca-Cola bottlers, Hunt-Wesson foods, Swift-Eckrich meats, Stiffel
lamps, Samsonite luggage, Tropicana juices, Max Factor cosmetics and
the Avis car rental agency.
   After the buyout, Beatrice began selling most of its businesses
in order to pay off the buyout debt and generate a return for
investors who put up money for the deal.
   For example, Avis was sold to a group led by its employees;
Tropicana to Seagram Co. Ltd.; Beatrice's international food
businesses to the investment firm TLC International; and a score of
other companies to a group led by former Beatrice Chairman Donald P.
Kelly.

<HEAD>Prison for Poindexter Would Be `Fundamentally Wrong,' Lawyer Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It ``would be fundamentally unjust'' to
imprison John M. Poindexter for lying about the Iran-Contra affair,
the former national security adviser's lawyer argued in court papers
filed Thursday.
   Defense attorney Richard Beckler, responding to a prosecution
request that Poindexter receive a prison term, urged U.S. District
Judge Harold H. Greene to consider Poindexter's lengthy service as a
Navy officer and ``the suffering he has endured'' since the
Iran-Contra affair became public 3{ years ago.
   Poindexter, 53, a retired Navy rear admiral, is scheduled to be
sentenced Monday on five felony convictions of conspiracy, making
false statements to Congress and obstructing congressional inquiries
into the Iran-Contra affair.
   He was found guilty of lying to Congress by denying the existence
of a covert operation to arm the Nicaraguan Contras and to conceal
U.S. involvement in an Israeli shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran in
1985.
   Poindexter, who served as President Reagan's national security
adviser from late 1985 until revelations about the Iran-Contra
affair forced his resignation in November 1986, faces up to 25 years
in prison and as much as $1.25 million in fines.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh's request for imprisonment
was ``made without the slightest reference to John Poindexter's
lifelong career of service to his country and to his community,''
said the sentencing memo bearing Beckler's signature.
   ``It is made without consideration of the heavy punishment that
the more than three-year `Iran-Contra' investigation has already
visited upon John Poindexter and his family,'' Beckler said.
   Iran-Contra prosecutors earlier this week told Greene that the
sentence ``must include a period of incarceration'' because the
``diet of lies'' Poindexter fed Congress ``did violence to this
nation's fundamental principles of government.''
   Prosecutors said imprisoning Poindexter would ``warn other
high-ranking public officials that criminal violations of the public
trust will result in more than mere loss of public employment.''
   But Beckler said the prosecution ``well knows that John
Poindexter has suffered far more than `mere loss of public
employment.'''
   ``He has lost a bright and promising career in the United States
Navy, he has endured the public ridicule of the Congress and the
media, and he has suffered financial hardship.''
   ``Most painful of all, he has been convicted,'' Beckler said.
   The sentencing memo quoted from letters to the court attesting to
Poindexter's moral character from Admiral James L. Holloway III,
former chief of Naval Operations, as well as Ronald H. Haines,
acting Episcopal bishop of Washington.

<HEAD>Trouble Erupts for Perpich Only Two Days After Gorbachev Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE LAHAMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Rudy Perpich had only two days to
savor the euphoria of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit.
   Now he's facing accusations from the Bush Administration of
behaving ``very badly'' because the state's two Republican senators
were barred from a luncheon for the Soviet president. On top of
that, he's grappling with questions about sexual harassment lawsuits
against his former chief of staff.
   Perpich faces a tough endorsement fight at the state
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party convention on Saturday, but his
campaign is predicting victory over his challenger, former Commerce
Commissioner Mike Hatch.
   ``The (Gorbachev) visit went well and the governor did a nice job
and that's what people are going to remember,'' campaign Chairman
John Stanoch said Thursday.
   A 60 percent majority is required for endorsement, and it's
widely expected that several ballots will be needed to determine a
winner.
   Perpich, who's seeking an unprecedented fourth term, and Hatch
say they will run in the Sept. 11 primary regardless of who's
endorsed.
   Perpich moved quickly to make the most of Gorbachev's Sunday
visit, which the governor said provided the greatest day of his
political career. Film of the visit will be used in campaign
commercials, Stanoch said Monday.
   But mid-week, Perpich was confronted with the news that one of
his former secretaries and another woman had filed lawsuits alleging
sexual harassment by Terry Montgomery, Perpich's former right-hand
man.
   The suits filed in Hennepin County District Court say Karen
Ehrisman and Gayle Treloar left their jobs at the state-funded
Greater Minnesota Corp., a rural development agency, because of the
alleged sexual harassment.
   Ehrisman, a secretary to Perpich for nearly five years, alleges
harassment by Montgomery at the agency and while she was the
governor's secretary.
   Montgomery was Perpich's chief of staff in 1977 and 1978 and from
1983 through August 1987, when he became head of the rural
development agency. He resigned as agency president in December
after a 22-year-old woman seeking an internship accused him of
making sexual advances. Those charges were dropped in March after
the agency paid the woman $130,000.
   The Bush Administration's complaint that Sens. Rudy Boschwitz and
Dave Durenberger were left out of the Gorbachev luncheon was raised
Wednesday by White House protocol chief Joseph Reed.
   ``It was my understanding with Governor Perpich that they were to
be invited. As far as I'm concerned he reneged on that
understanding,'' Reed told reporters at he White House.
   Perpich said he had never agreed to invite the senators and
complained the Gorbachev visit was now being marred by ``petty
politics.''
   The governor accused Boschwitz of working to sabotage the visit,
an allegation the senator denied.
   Stanoch said Wednesday's developments are no concern heading into
the party convention.
   ``I think that any delegate who is concerned about either issue
is going to have an opportunity to discuss it with the governor,''
he said Thursday.
   Still, Hatch pointed to the sexual harassment lawsuit as a
potential issue.
   ``These are very serious charges and fairness dictates that the
courts determine if they are justified,'' he said. ``However,
clearly, if they are justified, the governor has a tremendous
accountability problem.''
   Despite this week's ups and downs, Hatch expressed concern about
the lingering effects of Gorbachev's visit.
   ``There's no doubt about it. This Gorbachev visit threw a hand
grenade into events,'' Hatch said. ``We don't know what the outcome
of that will be. We do know that up until two, three weeks ago ...
we were substantially ahead.''
   No new campaign ads appeared this week, and both campaigns said
they were devoting their attention in the last days before the
convention to working with delegates individually.
   Hatch, 42, was appointed state commerce commissioner in 1983 by
Perpich after a two-year stint as party chairman. He has maintained
close relations with party regulars, while Perpich, 61, regularly
ignores party affairs.
   Hatch said he has 53 percent of the committed delegates, but 110
uncommitted delegates hold the key. There are 1,383 delegates who
will cast 1,261 votes because some delegates have a half-vote and
some a two-thirds vote.

   U.S. officials and political activists praised
the end of the state of emergency in South Africa on Thursday but
said the action doesn't warrant the removal of U.S. sanctions.
   The White House said the move by South African President F.W. de
Klerk was a sign of ``the remarkable progress'' made by the
white-minority government.
   De Klerk ended a 4-year-old national state of emergency in all
but the nation's Natal Province. The policy imposed some of the
government's harshest political restrictions on the country's
black-majority population.
   ``This is another significant step toward creating a climate
conducive to negotiations that will lead to a democratic, non-racial
South Africa,'' said Deputy White House Press Secretary Alixe Glen.
   It ``is a long overdue and important step which will help pave
the way to end the brutal system of apartheid,'' said Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., the prime sponsor of the 1986 Anti-Apartheid Act.
   The legislation barred landing rights in the United States to
South African Airways, banned U.S. import of South African uranium
and coal and prohibited new U.S. investments and bank loans in the
racially segregated country.
   ``Apartheid is still in place,'' Kennedy said, adding, ``This is
no time for the United States or any other nation to lift any
sanctions.''
   ``It's an important step forward but it clearly does not meet the
requirements of the lifting of sanctions,'' echoed Rep. Ronald
Dellums, D-Calif, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus.
   At the State Department, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher noted
that the Bush administration cannot legally modify U.S. sanctions
against South Africa until certain conditions are met.
   The law says the restrictions would be lifted automatically if
President Bush reported to Congress that the South African
government satisfied specific conditions for ending them.
   The law requires the South African government to repeal the state
of emergency nationwide and free black nationalist leader Nelson
Mandela as it did last February. Additionally, the government must
release all other political prisoners, legalize opposition political
parties and their activities and enter into good-faith negotiation
with representative black leaders without preconditions.
   The South African government also must repeal the Group Areas Act
and the Population Registration Act which restrict the movement and
residence of non-whites to comply U.S. preconditions.
   Randall Robinson, executive director of TransAfrica, a group that
lobbies on concerns of Africa and the Caribbean, commended the
action but called it ``a tiny measure.''
   ``It is a little late and all too small considering the distance
that must be traveled in a very short space of time,'' he added.
   Robinson said the move was conspicuously timed to coincide with a
13-nation trip by Mandela that will include a meeting with Bush in
Washington on June 25 and ``designed to purchase relief from the
painful Western sanctions.''
   De Klerk also is expected meet with Bush at a later date that has
not yet been set.

   President Bush, here to boost Republican
candidates, stopped at Farnsworth Elementary School, where he read
to a group of children and told them afterward, ``If you want to be
president, learn to read.''
   As for his time in the White House, Bush told the children:
   ``I like it a lot. They've got good food there,''
   He said being president is ``not all hard work'' and told the
students he and his wife, Barbara, like to play with their dog,
Millie, after he finishes work.
   One child asked how many rooms are in the White House.
   ``That's a good question,'' Bush answered, quessing that the
Executive Mansion has about 10 bedrooms.
   He told the children to have their parents and grandparents read
to them. After he read to the youngsters, they applauded. Bush then
asked:
   ``You really like it or are you just saying that?''

   A guest bedroom in billionaire Donald
Trump's mansion was gutted by fire Thursday, but there was no
structural damage to the oceanside estate, fire officials said.
   ``The cause of the fire is undetermined,'' said Fire Chief Ken
Elmore. ``We don't have any reason to believe that it's suspicious
at this time.''
   A member of the household staff at the 118-room Mar-a-Lago
mansion called the 911 emergency line shortly after 8 a.m. to report
the fire in a two-story guest wing attached to the main building,
said Elmore.
   About 15 firefighters put the fire out in about 15 minutes,
before flames could spread beyond the bedroom and attached bathroom,
Elmore said. No one was injured.
   Elmore said no one had been staying in the guest bedroom. Smoke
spread to several other bedrooms in the wing, Elmore said. He had no
estimate of the dollar loss.
   The 58-bedroom mansion is on a 17-acre strip of land between the
Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway.
   Trump bought the 64-year-old Mar-a-Lago, Spanish for ``sea to
lake,'' in 1985 for $7 million from the Post Foundation. The
coral-colored home is one of about 130 in this island community
bearing a historical designation.

<TEXT>
   Up to a half-million opposition backers
Thursday staged the capital's largest rally ever, chanting and
singing three days before the country's first free elections in
nearly 60 years.
   The ruling Socialist Party, formerly the Communists, mounted a
nearby election rally in downtown Sofia that attracted at least
300,000 people, rally organizers said.
   A police cordon prevented any clashes between the two groups.
   During the opposition rally by the Union of Democratic Forces,
people thronged along one mile of Lenin Boulevard, where four stages
were set up for speakers, singers and other performers. The crowd
also spilled into many side streets in a sea of swaying blue
opposition pennants and banners.
   ``I have been born in Sofia, I have lived in Sofia, but I have
never seen the like,'' said one demonstrator.
   Participants in a crowd estimated at 400,000 to 500,000 shouted
``Victory, Victory!'' and ``Down with the CP,'' the initials of the
now-renamed Communist Party, throughout the nearly five-hour rally.
   Messages of support from foreign leaders, including Polish
Solidarity chief Lech Walesa and U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
were greeted with loud clapping and cheering.
   ``The UDF must win, otherwise there will be no real life, because
otherwise we would find ourselves even deeper in the morass,'' said
Nina Galobova, a student in her early 20s, using the initials of the
opposition alliance.
   ``What we are still lacking is democracy and a system that will
show to the world that we are worthy of its respect,'' UDF chairman
Zhelju Zhelev told the cheering crowd.
   He said Sunday's election ``will decide whether Bulgaria will
join Europe and the world or will remain stifled in its own narrow
confines.'' It will be this country's first free polling since 1932.
   East Germany, Hungary, and Romania have held free national
elections in recent months after last year's wave of democratic
revolutions.
   During the Socialist rally, demonstrators shouted ``We are
many!'' and ``We shall win!''
   Party chief Alexander Lilov, Premier Andrei Lukanov and Defense
Minister Dobri Dzhurov all spoke to the crowd.
   Those leaders, along with President Petar Mladenov, are believed
to have played a leading role in ousting longtime Communist leader
Todor Zhivkov last year.
   Lilov claimed the Socialist Party has built back up to 1 million
members after new people were admitted the last few weeks.
   ``The elections will confirm the party as the most influential
political force in the country,'' he declared.
   All three speakers attacked the opposition alliance, saying it
had tried to negate everything ``that has been created in the last
45 years'' under Communism.
   At a late-night news conference, Lukanov said that even if his
party wins more than 50 percent of Sunday's vote, ``I refuse to head
a one-party government.''
   Socialist officials have said a coalition government is needed to
lead Bulgaria.

<HEAD>Moynihan Presents Social Security Plan at Budget Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., tried to
sell his plan to cut Social Security taxes to high-level budget
negotiators Thursday but got a mixed reaction, participants said.
   Moynihan visited the sixth session of private budget talks
between Bush administration officials and congressional leaders. The
bargainers spent most of the day discussing the possibility of
cutting federal benefit programs in order to reduce the budget
deficit, with their discussions focusing on technical issues. No
offers were exchanged.
   Moynihan has proposed rolling back the 7.65 percent levy workers
pay to the retirement system. He argues that Social Security builds
a surplus of tens of billions of dollars every year, money that is
used to shrink the apparent size of the deficit.
   The plan has attracted the attention of tax-conscious
politicians. Some Democrats say it would be wise for the party to
support a tax cut, while others, joined by Republicans, say it would
drive the government's red ink even deeper.
   Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the ranking Republican on the
Senate Budget Committee, said there was ``not as much positive
support'' for Moynihan's plan among negotiators as he had thought
there might be. He predicted the plan ``has little chance of
passing'' Congress.
   But Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said
he believed the proposal could be approved by lawmakers.
   ``We have to factor that in. The Moynihan proposal could be a
reality,'' Sasser said.
   Participants said that the negotiators expressed little
enthusiasm for cutting benefit programs, which include Social
Security, Medicare and payments to farmers.
   White House budget director Richard Darman said that the chairmen
of congressional committees who oversee those programs attended
Thursday's session and opposed spending cuts.
   ``If we were to come to a consensus around what they were
suggesting, we'd be moving in the wrong direction,'' Darman said.

<HEAD>Library of Congress to Resume Poetry Awards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Library of Congress announced Friday it
will award a national poetry prize in October, resuming a tradition
halted more than 40 years ago in a controversy over the library's
award of a prize to interned American poet Ezra Pound.
   The new Rebekah Johnson Bobbit National Prize for Poetry is named
after President Lyndon B. Johnson's sister, who met her future
husband while working in the library's cataloguing department in the
1930s.
   The $10,000 prize will honor the best book of American poetry
published in the preceding two years. The funds will come from a
trust created by Mrs. Bobbitt's family in her memory.
   A three-member jury will select the 1990 winner in mid-September
from nominations submitted by publishers.
   The Bobbitt Prize will be the first poetry prize given by the
library since it awarded the 1948 Bollingen Prize to Pound for his
``Pisan Cantos.'' Afterward, Congress prohibited the library from
granting awards or prizes.
   Pound was an admirer of the late Italian dictator Benito
Mussolini and broadcast Fascist propaganda to the United States
during World War II. He was arrested for treason after the war and
was judged insane in 1946.
   He spent 12 years in a Washington mental hospital until he was
released in 1958 and returned to Italy. He died in 1972.
   At the request of Librarian of Congress James H. Billington,
Congress reversed its ban two years ago.
   ``With this award, the United States once again joins Great
Britain, France and other countries in honoring poetry by presenting
a prize on behalf of the nation,'' a library statement said.

<TEXT>
   Three Democratic members of the Senate Banking
Committee introduced legislation Thursday that would create a
Justice Department strike force to attack fraud at savings and loans
and other financial institutions.
   The bill, written by Sens. Alan Dixon of Illinois, Tim Wirth of
Colorado and Bob Graham of Florida, would establish a Financial
Services Crime Division, headed by an assistant attorney general
   As part of S&amp;L legislation enacted in August, the Bush
administration earmarked an additional $50 million to pursue S&amp;L
fraud. It's hiring 368 new employees, including 202 FBI agents and
120 prosecutors, to staff teams in 27 cities.
   Doug Tillett, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said the
strike force proposal ``on the face of it, appears to be a
duplication of effort.''
   However, Democrats point to a backlog of 2,300 uninvestigated
cases of suspected fraud, each involving a loss of more than
$100,000, as evidence the administration needs to intensify its
effort.
   ``These numbers are astounding and cannot be ignored,'' Wirth said
   Democrats also fault the administration for not seeking the full
$75 million in anti-fraud money authorized by the S&amp;L bill.
   ``This country is being robbed blind and the thieves are getting
away scot-free,'' Dixon said.
   Tillett said in the past two years Justice has obtained 51
convictions of S&amp;L executives from its Dallas office, adding: ``I
think it's wrong to suggest the department is doing nothing. We're
working very hard.''
   He said the department would not shy from asking Congress for
more money, if needed.
   On April 30, the Senate, by a 50-48 vote, rejected a proposal to
divert $30 million from promoting tourism in Panama to fighting S&amp;L
fraud.
   Cosponsors of the strike force bill, all Democrats, are Sens.
Paul Simon of Illinois, Richard Bryan of Nevada, John Kerry of
Massachusetts, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Claiborne Pell of Rhode
Island.

   An Alzheimer's disease diagnosis is absolute only
after an autopsy, experts said Thursday in the wake of the
doctor-assisted suicide of a woman who had been told she had the
incurable illness.
   ``The difficulty in some cases is that it may be misdiagnosed,''
said Michelle Manning, deputy director of the Alzheimer's
Association's Detroit-area chapter.
   As many as 80 diseases can appear to be Alzheimer's, which
affects up to 4 million people, most of them elderly, Manning said.
Alzheimer's is a degenerative brain and nerve disorder that robs
people of their memories, abilities to function and eventually their
lives.
   A new spotlight has focused on Alzheimer's since Monday, when Dr.
Jack Kevorkian of suburban Royal Oak hooked Janet Adkins, 54, to a
machine and watched her die as she pressed a button that pumped
heart-stopping chemicals into her system.
   Kevorkian had driven with Mrs. Adkins, of Portland, Ore., to a
park outside Detroit and attached her to the electric-powered device
in the back of his van. Kevorkian said she was dead within minutes
after she pressed the button.
   Mrs. Adkins, who had despaired after being told a year ago she
had Alzheimer's, had read of Kevorkian's device and ``thought that
sounded like a very, very humane and painless way to end her life,''
said her husband, Ronald.
   Michigan State Police seized Kevorkian's van and suicide device
after he reported Mrs. Adkins' death Monday. Prosecutors planned to
seek an injunction to stop Kevorkian from using the device again at
a Friday hearing in Oakland County Circuit Court.
   The Medical Examiner's Office refused to release results of Mrs.
Adkins' autopsy Thursday. The prosecutor's office did not return
several calls. Ronald Adkins said Thursday that the autopsy, which
his wife had requested, had not been completed.
   Medical experts said extensive tests must be conducted when a
person is suspected of having Alzheimer's. But the diagnosis isn't
definite until brain tissue is examined under a microscope, they
said.
   ``It's always called probable Alzheimer's disease. That's
probable in capital letters,'' said Dr. Creighton Phelps, vice
president of medical and scientific affairs for the Chicago-based
Alzheimer's Association.
   ``The criteria fordefinite diagnosis is after death,'' he said.
   A probable diagnosis is usually between 80 percent and 90 percent
accurate, he said. A possible diagnosis is about 70 percent accurate.
   Tests include memory checks, brain scans and spinal taps.
Physicians also interview the patient's family about changes in
behavior, Phelps said.
   Symptoms include memory loss, confusion, difficulty in judgment,
changes in mood and personality and loss of bodily functions. In the
final stages, a patient may be as helpless as a newborn, unable to
recognize relatives.
   Dr. Norman Foster, professor of neurology at the University of
Michigan, base for the Michigan Alzheimer's Disease Research Center,
said it takes at least a week, and often a month, to check brain
tissue under a microscope for the tangled clumps of cells common in
Alzheimer's patients.
   Foster said physicians usually call on counselors in Alzheimer's
cases.
   ``The physicians are not really prepared to handle all the legal,
social and economic ramifications by this illness,'' Foster said.
   Alzheimer's support groups were shaken at the news of Kevorkian's
machine.
   ``We have a number of services available that would hopefully
prevent this kind of decision from taking place,'' said Manning of
the support group here. ``We would hope that they explore other
avenues.''
   Foster said: ``People with Alzheimer's shouldn't feel so
hopeless. ... There's lots of things they can do. We don't promise
an instant cure but we're attacking this disease.''
   Advances in testing are encouraging, said Robert P. Lisak, Wayne
State University neurology chairman and chief neurologist at Detroit
Medical Center and Harper Hospital.
   The newest test measures a protein believed associated with
Alzheimer's. A study in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association said the protein can be used as a model for a diagnostic
test in spinal fluid.
   ``Breakthroughs don't come like a bolt out of the blue,'' Lisak
said. ``No one person is going to make a sudden discovery. Modern
science builds on it.
   ``At this point, you want to make sure it's not something
treatable and then you can kind of say it's probably Alzheimer's.''

<HEAD>Jury Absolves Soldier in Journalist Slaying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury has absolved an army
private in the killing of a TV journalist, but colleagues of the
slain soundman on Thursday accused troops of pressuring frightened
jurors to find the soldier innocent.
   Others called it another failure of the Salvadoran judicial
system to punish the military, which has been blamed for thousands
of summary executions, kidnappings and torture of suspected
government opponents the past decade.
   President Alfredo Cristiani acknowledged Thursday the presence of
30 soldiers at the brief deliberations Wednesday might have swayed
the jury in what high-ranking military authorities had called an
``open and shut case'' against Pvt. Jose Orellana.
   The members of Orellana's unit, the elite Arce battalion, entered
the courthouse in the eastern provincial capital of San Miguel as
the jury began deliberating.
   The five-member jury then found Orellana innocent of murdering
Channel 12 soundman Mauricio Pineda at a military roadblock during
1989 elections.
   Marcos Antonio Guevara, who covered the trial for Channel 12,
said the jurors were afraid of the soldiers.
   ``They were telling the jury in so many words that if they
delivered a guilty verdict, they would have to contend with the Arce
battalion,'' he said. ``The jurors live there. They leave the court
alone and have their skins to think about.''
   Referring to the soldiers' presence, Cristiani told a news
confernce: ``It could have had an effect. Certainly, in many cases,
the reaching of a decision completely free from outside influence is
difficult.''
   The prosecution said it would appeal.
   Channel 12 news director Narciso Castillo said the absence of the
defendant at the trial and the intimidating presence of soldiers at
the courthouse was grounds for overturning the verdict.
   Pineda was shot at a military roadblock March 19, 1989. He was
part of a crew in a pickup truck covering that day's nationwide
presidential and legislative elections.
   Two other journalists were killed and another was seriously
wounded during the election weekend.
   One died in a cross-fire during combat between leftist rebels and
government troops. The other was killed by air force paratroopers at
a roadblock near the capital. His colleague was seriously wounded in
the same incident. The paratroopers have yet to go to trial.
   El Salvador's highest ranking military authorities admitted
Orellana fired on the Channel 12 pickup without provocation or
justification. They said the case was the most open-and-shut of the
slayings of the journalists during the elections.
   Raul Beltran, a Salvadoran journalist next to Pineda when he was
shot, said of the verdict, ``This kind of justice is disappointing.''
   Though the armed forces have been blamed for thousands of
executions, kidnappings and torture in the 10-year-old civil war
against leftist guerrillas, no officer has been convicted _ or even
tried _ for a crime of human rights abuse.
   Four officers, including a colonel, are among eight army men
charged with murder in the Nov. 16 slaying of six Jesuit priests,
their housekeeper and her daughter.
   According to testimony from those charged, the priests were
killed by a unit of the elite U.S.-trained Atlacatl battalion.
   Atlacatl's commander, Col. Oscar Leon Linares, on Wednesday bade
farewell to his troops before leaving for a new post. Leon was
promoted June 1 to military commander of Morazan Province.
   According to testimony, the Jesuits _ widely respected academics
_ were killed because many high-ranking army officers considered
them guerrilla ideologues.
   Far from mentioning the Jesuit massacre as a black mark on the
Atlacatl record and cautioning his troops against repetition of such
action, Leon told them in his speech:
   ``You must remember that in front of us we have a terrorist
combatant ... but behind that combatant there are intelligent
sectors that use any kind of calumny and other tricks to gain
ground.''

<HEAD>President Gets Plan to Trim Nicaraguan Army</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Army chief Humberto Ortega on Thursday
presented President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro with a plan to trim
and reorganize Nicaragua's armed forces, the largest in Central
America.
   Mrs. Chamorro's campaign pledge to cut the armed forces helped
her defeat Gen. Ortega's brother, former President Daniel Ortega, in
an election Feb. 25.
   Although Ortega's Sandinista government never gave official
figures on the size of the military, it was acknowledged to be the
largest in the region. After Mrs. Chamorro banned reserve duty and
ended the draft, about 50,000 soldiers were left on active duty.
   A one-paragraph army communique gave no details of the plan, but
government sources who demanded anonymity said it outlined the
eventual reduction of 20,000 soldiers from the armed forces.
   Presidential spokesman Danilo Lacayo said Mrs. Chamorro had no
comment on the proposal.
   The army communique said Gen. Ortega presented Mrs. Chamorro with
``the document that contains the general plan of reduction and
restructuring of the Sandinista People's Army.''
   The communique said Gen. Ortega has fulfilled ``her instructions
of April 25 in her speech to the nation.''
   Mrs. Chamorro said in the inaugural speech that she would order
Gen. Ortega to devise a plan to trim the fighting machine he had
spent a decade building with Soviet help. She also announced she was
taking over Gen. Ortega's post as defense minister.
   Although the army still bears the name of the revolutionary party
Mrs. Chamorro ousted in the election, a transition protocol with the
Sandinistas obliged the officer corps to give up party positions. In
return, Mrs. Chamorro promised to respect ``the integrity and
professionalism'' of the army.
   Ortega gave up his post as one of the nine members of the
Sandinista National Directorate, which had run Nicaragua since 1979.
   But Mrs. Chamorro's decision to let him remain as armed forces
commander drove a wedge between her and the 14-party United National
Opposition coalition that helped bring her to power.
   The United States backed Mrs. Chamorro and the Contra rebels that
fought the Sandinistas.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ignalnia nuclear power plant in
northeastern Lithuania was shut down by its automatic safety system
for unknown reasons Thursday, the Washington office of the
Lithuanian Information Center said.
   The plant uses the same reactor design as used at Chernobyl which
exploded in the world's worst nuclear accident four years ago.
   The center, quoting a statement issued by the Lithuanian Supreme
Council in Vilnius, said operations of the plant will be halted for
at least two days while the reasons for the shutdown are
investigated.
   The information center said the incident throws a new burden on
Lithuania's energy production facilities already strained by a
partial Soviet fuel embargo.
   The statement by the Lithuanian Supreme Council said the Ignalina
plant lost power at 10:52 a.m. local time and added: ``During the
course of normal functioning of the second reactor, for reasons
unapparent for the time being, the shutdown system of the reactor
became activated.''
   ``Now the entire workload of electrical energy must be transfered
to the regional electrical plant which is almost completely depleted
of emergency fuel resources,'' the statement said.
   The statement quoted Lithuanian Energy Minister Leonas Asmantas
as saying sabotage was not suspected.
   The partial fuel embargo was imposed by the Kremlin to pressure
the Lithuanian parliament to suspend its March 11 declaration of
independence.
   The Lithuanian Information Center said that as of May 28 the
embargo had caused a 25 percent reduction in electrical power
production in the Baltic republic.
   The Ignalia site has two 1,500-megawatt reactors, and it was not
clear from the statement if both were in operation when the plant
was shut down.
   The reactors are the graphite-moderated, water-cooled designed
designated ``RBMK'' in the Soviet union, one of which ran out of
control and exploded at Chernobyl on April 26, 1986, killing 31
people and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people
because of the dispersion of highly radioactive material over
thousands of square miles.
   The safety systems at Chernobyl were disconnected at the time for
unauthorized experiments.

<HEAD>Thatcher Urges NATO to Keep Its A-Weapons</HEAD>

`The allies...'</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   NATO on Thursday took a fresh look at
its future in a Europe of receding East-West tensions, and British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher urged members to hold onto
``sufficient nuclear weapons and the means of delivering them.''
   Yet Mrs. Thatcher, on her way to Moscow to see President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, concluded Europe faces a ``new situation created by
Soviet troop withdrawals'' and the prospect of a new agreement to
reduce U.S. and Soviet conventional forces.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III reported he found the
Soviet attitude about enrolling a unified Germany in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization ``much more encouraging'' since
Gorbachev held summit talks in Washington last week with President
Bush.
   He told foreign ministers from 15 Western nations that the shift
was ``more of a change of spirit'' than anything Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said to him specifically at their
meeting Tuesday night in Copenhagen, Denmark.
   Baker made his comments during a private session. They were
disclosed by a senior official.
   As the allies met, leaders of the Warsaw Pact indicated they
would reshape their own alliance from a military to a political body
and declared the ``enemy image'' of the East and West a thing of the
past.
   In Moscow, the Warsaw Pact leaders announced their ``readiness
for constructive cooperation'' with NATO and said they favored the
creation of a new ``all-European security system and the creation of
a single Europe of peace and cooperation,'' without artificial
barriers and ``ideological hostility.''
   Despite earlier reports that Hungary might want to pull out of
the alliance, Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Kvitsinsky of the Soviet
Union said ``there wasn't a single statement made relating to a wish
to quit the Warsaw Treaty Organization.''
   No agreement was reported at the Moscow session on Western
proposals for making a united Germany part of NATO.
   The allies reaffirmed their commitment to NATO membership for the
unified Germany and also to ``try to meet the legitimate needs of
the Soviet government so they don't feel isolated,'' a senior U.S.
official said later Wednesday.
   ``The Soviet Union has to get over the idea of seeing NATO as an
enemy and see NATO as a partner,'' said the official, who briefed
American reporters under rules guaranteeing he would not be
identified.
   Earlier, a British official said his government had
``difficulties'' with the idea of exchanges with a faltering
Soviet-led alliance. It would be ``life after death'' for the Warsaw
Pact, he said.
   The allies said the changes in Europe required a strategic review
of troop levels, weaponry and the conditions for using them,
according to the U.S. official.
   A more upbeat account came from the Italian foreign minister,
Gianni de Michelis.
   He said Baker and West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, who also met with Shevardnadze in Copenhagen, ``told us
they are optimistic, that the role of a unified Germany in NATO will
not be a problem in negotiations with the Soviet Union.''
   But, he said, Moscow wanted to know ``what kind of NATO will
Germany belong to?''
   The two-day meeting at a resort in Turnberry, on Scotland's
rugged west coast, is the third in a series held this spring to try
to map out a new strategy for NATO. The members meet in London next
month to formally begin work on NATO's future.
   Mrs. Thatcher, in her speech, insisted on the allies keeping
nuclear weapons.
   ``We must retain sufficient nuclear weapons, and the means of
delivering them, to meet our long-term security needs,'' she said.
``Our job, as ministers responsible for our countries' defense and
security, is to take the long view.''
   However, in an apparent ad lib at the end of her speech, Mrs.
Thatcher assured Moscow that NATO did not threaten the Soviet Union.
   ``NATO has never attacked anyone,'' she said.
   Baker told the allies, in a statement made public later, that
``we can and should be prepared to meet reasonable Soviet concerns.''
   But, Baker said, ``we cannot acquiesce in an effort to block a
full return to German sovereignty or to use ostensible security
concerns over Germany as a surrogate for weakening the alliance.''
   Baker told the allies that the defense of Europe primarily will
remain in NATO's hands.
   ``NATO will remain an important contributor to the legitimacy and
stability of the new Europe, although its functions and capabilities
will evolve with the new times of changing challenges,'' he said.
   The Soviets have been resisting the U.S. demand for NATO
membership for a unified Germany, suggesting instead their powerful
neighbor be in the Warsaw Pact as well. Shevardnadze, meanwhile,
proposed to Baker that the two alliances adopt some measures to
guard against a revival of German militarism.
   Baker offered the Soviet official a nine-point package of
assurances, including a promise that the merger of East Germany with
West Germany would not lead to demands to recover territory lost at
the end of World War II.
   He also assured Shevardnadze that NATO would revise its strategy
to reflect the lessening of East-West tensions and take on more of a
political mission.
   West Germany's Genscher said the Soviets were interested in NATO
changing into more of a political structure and engaging the Warsaw
Pact in ``confidence-building measures and cooperation,'' West
German sources said.
   Genscher informed the allies West Germany may not hold elections
scheduled for December. A senior official of another NATO delegation
said unification is moving so quickly that combined elections may be
held in East and West Germany by mid-January.

   An ethnic Estonian considered a strong backer of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms was elected the new
Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church and its following of tens
of millions on Thursday.
   Metropolitan Alexi of Leningrad and Novgorod won election in a
secret ballot, said Anna Generalova, a church spokeswoman.
   Alexi, 61, takes the helm of the church at a time when decades of
Soviet government repression are being lifted and interest in
religion is growing.
   A church council of 330 members chose him as successor to
Patriarch Pimen, who died May 3 at age 79.
   He won despite predictions that many would consider him an
inappropriate leader because he is of Baltic, rather than Russian,
descent.
   In his pre-election program published by a church journal, he
backed traditional church positions and spoke out in support of
Gorbachev's reforms, saying they could improve both the material and
spiritual lives of believers.
   He also pledged to work to solve ecological problems, according
to Keston College, a British-based organization that closely follows
events in the Russian Orthodox Church.
   Alexi runs the prestigious Leningrad diocese and has been
responsible for the Russian Orthodox Church in Estonia as well. He
was one of several clergymen elected last year as a deputy to the
Soviet Congress of People's Deputies.
   The meeting of the Local Council, which includes clergymen, monks
and some laymen, was held at the Trinity-St. Sergius Monastery in
Zagorsk, northeast of Moscow.
   It was closed to the press, but Soviet TV showed scores of
bearded bishops in their flat-topped black or white mitres and
flowing robes gathered at rows of flower-bedecked tables as the
meeting began.
   In choosing Alexi, the council passed over a top cleric in the
forefront of a bitter dispute with Ukrainian Catholics and another
candidate considered a probable compromise candidate.
   He comes to power when Russian Orthodoxy is being virtually
reborn in the Soviet Union.
   So many churches have been returned to religious authorities to
be restored and reopened that observers say the church is strapped
for money.
   A law guaranteeing freedom of conscience is slowly working its
way throughout the Soviet legislature, raising hopes that decades of
the officially atheist state's repression of religion are coming to
an end.
   After the Bolsheviks took power in 1917, they deprived the church
of all legal rights and imprisoned or executed thousands of priests.
   The church leadership decided to conform to the state, and it
survived despite savage persecution under Stalin and suppression
under subsequent governments.
   The number of Russian Orthodox worshipers is estimated at 20
million to 45 million.

   Thunderstorms again pounded the central Plains and the middle
Mississippi Valley, producing locally heavy rains and some severe
weather Thursday, while skies were partly sunny to sunny across much
of the West and Southeast.
   Around Louisville, thunderstorms produced four tornadoes, and in
southern Indiana and northern Kentucky golf ball-size hail fell.
   Thunderstorms in the lower Missouri Valley created a tornado near
Riverton, Iowa, and produced dime-size hail at Frankfort, Kan., and
golf ball-size hail at Omaha, Neb.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended through parts of Nebraska,
Iowa, Missouri, Illinois Oklahoma, Missouri, Tennessee and North
Carolina on Thursday afternoon.
   Thunderstorms in the nation's midsection soaked some areas,
particularly in northern Missouri which was deluged with more than
six inches of rain. The Spirit of Saint Louis Airport in St. Louis
reported 2.94 inches of in a six-hour period, and Mexico, Mo., was
doused with more than three inches in a two-hour period Thursday
morning.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms formed over New England,
Florida and along the central Gulf coast. A few showers fell in the
northern Rockies and the northern Plains.
   Strong southerly winds prevailed across the southern Plains and
lower Mississippi Valley, and strong northwesterly winds ushered
cooler air into the Northeast.
   Temperatures were in the 80s and 90s in the Southeast and
south-central parts of the country, with readings approaching the
100-degree mark in the southern Plains; 60s and 70s across the
north-central and northeastern states; 50s and 60s in the Pacific
Northwest and the northern Rockies.
   Readings soared into the 90s and above 100 degrees in the desert
Southwest.
   The nation's low Thursday was 33 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.

   Rebels and government troops battled
with rockets, mortars and automatic weapons in heavy fighting
Thursday on the huge Firestone rubber plantation 25 miles outside
Monrovia, refugees and diplomats reported.
   Fighting was also reported at Robertsfield International Airport,
which adjoins the 120,000-acre, U.S.-managed plantation.
   The diplomats and refugees said the government forces appeared to
be mounting an offensive to retake the rubber plantation, the
world's largest, captured by the rebels earlier this week.
   People who fled the fighting reported seeing at least one unit of
50 government reinforcements moving toward the battle site.
   President Samuel Doe dug in at his oceanside executive mansion
and was quoted as telling a U.S. diplomat on Thursday that the
rebels would take this capital city of 400,000 people ``over my dead
body.''
   In Washington, the State Department said Thursday that ``due to
the potential threat to lives, all Americans are strongly advised to
depart Liberia immediately.'' It said U.S. officials had arranged
special commercial flights.
   The department put the total number of Americans still in Liberia
as nearly 2,000.
   U.S. and British naval ships are off Liberia to assist in any
evacuation.
   West Germany was preparing to evacuate about 100 German citizens
and 100 other West Europeans, the Foreign Ministry in Bonn said
Thursday.
   There was shooting and the sound of shells falling near
Robertsfield Airport, residents of the area and diplomats said. The
plantation is operated by Bridgestone-Firestone, Inc., an Akron,
Ohio-based subsidiary of Japan's Bridgestone company.
   A Nigerian government official said in Lagos, the Nigerian
capital, on Thursday that Doe would be welcome if he wished to go to
Nigeria.
   Doe denied in a statement he was seeking asylum.
   He said he asked no one to seek asylum on his behalf and has ``no
intention to leave or abandon the country in the face of the
crisis.''
   Doe took power in this West African nation of 2.5 million in a
bloody coup in 1980. The rebels, led by former Doe aide Charles
Taylor, accuse his administration of corruption, economic
mismanagement and human rights abuses.
   American officials said Washington had been quietly asking
several African countries whether they would be willing to provide
Doe with a safe haven if he is forced to flee.
   In London, Amnesty International, the international human rights
organization, said the two warring sides were killing non-combatants
and prisoners and asked them to stop.
   Hundreds of rebel and government supporters have been killed in
Liberia in nearly six months since the rebel forces began their
march toward Monrovia.
   Most of the 1,000 Liberians known to have died were killed by
government troops.
   Ethnic differences complicate the uprising. The civil war has
pitted Mandingos and Krahns, who support Doe, against the Gio and
Mano.
   About half the Liberian soldiers have deserted since the fighting
began Dec. 24, reducing the army to 3,000 to 4,000 men _ about the
same size as rebel forces, according to diplomats.
   Official sources said that in recent fighting, rebels ambushed an
army checkpoint less than 10 miles from Monrovia and wounded three
soldiers.
   At least four Cabinet ministers live in that area, said the
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   It was the closest yet to Monrovia that any fighting has been
reported.
   Doe was quoted by a European diplomat as telling a U.S. diplomat
the rebels would have to go ``over my dead body'' to take Monrovia.
   A Doe request for U.S. military aid was turned down.
   On Wednesday, Information Minister Emmanuel Bouwier and rebel
forces reported that U.S.-trained rebel commander Elmer Johnson was
killed in combat, but gave no details.
   Johnson, 31, had a Massachusetts driver's license with an address
at an apartment complex in Quincy, just south of Boston, a newspaper
reported. The Patriot Ledger of Quincy quoted neighbors as saying
they were surprised Johnson, whom they considered mild-mannered,
would be involved in violence.
   Refugees reaching Monrovia said rebels killed dozens of Krahn and
Mandingo civilians in their advance toward Monrovia, which is
suffering from widespread food shortages.
   A Mandingo woman said rebels burst into a mosque in her town and
opened fire on people who spoke the Mandingo dialect. ``They just
shot the people,'' she said.

<HEAD>Likud Appears on Verge of Forming Israeli Government</HEAD>

   Likud officials announced Thursday they were
close to forming a right-wing coalition government but conceded that
a key ultra-Orthodox religious party was still holding out.
   Their statements came after a party official said caretaker Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir had agreed to take tougher measures against
the Palestinian uprising in an effort to draw important far-right
factions into a coalition.
   Shamir, who heads the rightist Likud bloc, also has promised his
new coalition would allocate more money for enlarging the Jewish
settlements in the occupied lands, the daily Maariv reported. The
United States opposes new settlements, saying they are an obstacle
to peace.
   Ariel Sharon, chairman of the Likud Central Committee, said
Thursday that Likud had succeeded in garnering a 62-vote majority
coalition in the 120-member parliament. He said he would convene the
Likud's governing committee on Sunday to approve the new coalition.
   Shamir was expected to tell President Chaim Herzog on Friday
morning he succeeded in mustering enough seats for a majority
coalition, just hours before his deadline to form a government
expires, Likud officials said.
   However, the officials conceded they had not received a final
pledge of support from the Shas party, an ultra-Orthodox group.
   David Magen, a Likud minister, told Israel television they were
waiting to receive a positive answer from Shas but said he was
optimistic it would agree to participate in the government.
   In a related development, protesters demanding electoral reform
clashed with police outside the prime minister's office, shouting
they wanted an end to what they called ``political extortion.'' No
injured were reported.
   Feverish attempts to overcome feuds lasted into the night, with
Likud offering more government jobs to ultra-Orthodox religious
parties whose support is crucial for forming the Cabinet.
   Labor Party officials greeted the likelihood of a Likud-led
coalition government with caution, but one Labor leader said such a
right-wing government would reduce world support for the Jewish
state.
   ``This will be a right-wing extremist government, a tragic
government for Israel,'' Labor Party Chairman Micha Harish said on
Israel TV.
   Head of the Government Press and a member of Likud, Yossi Olmert,
told The Associated Press ``it is very, very likely'' Shamir will
tell the president he has formed a government. He added it was
``almost certain'' Shas would join.
   The Shas Party was instrumental in bringing down Shamir's unity
government on March 15, when it abstained from a Labor-led vote of
no confidence over Likud's refusal to agree to a U.S.-proposed
meeting with Palestinian representatives.
   Labor leader Shimon Peres then failed in a 35-day bid to form a
left-of-center coalition. On April 27, Herzog gave Shamir a mandate
to try to form a government.
   Danny Dayan, secretary-general of the far-right Tehiya Party,
said earlier Thursday that Shamir had agreed to hard-line action
against the 30-month-old Palestinian uprising to meet his deadline
for shaping a government.
   Dayan, reached by telephone, said ``the policy guidelines will
say that measures will be taken to end the intefadeh,'' or uprising.
However, he said the agreement did not detail what measures were
involved.
   Untra-right leaders have been demanding such steps as expelling
Arab stone-throwers from the occupied territories and destroying
more homes of terror suspects.
   Across the street from the coalition dealings in Shamir's office,
police used force to disperse about 200 protesters calling for an
end to the use of political posts and public funds to lure defectors
to cross party lines and woo religious factions. No injuries or
arrests were reported.

<HEAD>Haiti To Hold General Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti will hold its first free
elections in 186 years by October and the voting will be supervised
by international observers, the electoral council said Thursday.
   Council President Jean-Robert Sabalat told a news conference the
exact date will be announced next week after a new electoral bill is
submitted to President Ertha-Pascal Trouillot, Haiti's provisional
leader.
   Balloting will be held for local office, seats in parliament, and
for the presidency, he added.
   The news conference marked the first public appearance of the
nine-member independent electoral body since it was formed May 2.
   Sabalat said the elections had the president's total support and
the ``collaboration'' of the army.
   Seventeen candidates have announced for the presidency.
   The United States granted this impoverished Caribbean island
nation $5.4 million in electoral assistance last month.
   Sabalat said Haiti was also counting on financial aid from the
Caribbean Economic Community, the United Nations and the
Organization of American States.
   Ms. Pascal-Trouillot was sworn in March 13 after Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril fled to exile amid widespread protests against his military
government in this nation of about 5.3 million.
   Haiti, the first republic of former slaves, gained independence
from France in 1804 and has since been governed mostly by repressive
military rulers.
   On Nov. 29, 1987, Haiti's first free general elections were
canceled after thugs in collusion with the army killed at least 34
voters at the polls.

<HEAD>Pakistan's Bhutto Rules Out Martial Law in Sind Province</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on
Thursday ruled out martial law in her home province in southern
Pakistan, where more than 400 people have died in ethnic violence in
the past month.
   She also accused opposition parties of trying to stir up trouble
in Sindh province for their own selfish interests.
   Her government is under pressure to declare martial law to halt
bloodshed between native Sindhis and Moslem Indian immigrants known
as Mohajirs.
   Pakistan has spent 25 years of its 43-year history under military
rule.
   Ms. Bhutto, whose father was overthrown in a military coup in
1977 and executed two years later, said Thursday, ``No patriot could
talk of martial law in the country. Only those elements who had
benefited directly or indirectly are talking of martial law. They
are trying in vain.''
   Last week she called out the army to help the Sindh government
restore peace. But critics and supporters agree the problem must be
solved politically, not militarily.
   The Mohajirs make up the better-educated middle-class in the
province's cities. Sindhis complain the Mohajirs monopolize the best
jobs and take the most valuable land.
   The Mohajir Qami Movement blames Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's
Party, the party in power in the province, for the chaos.
   The movement is vital to any settlement. It represents Moslem
Indians who immigrated to Pakistan following the 1947 partition of
the subcontinent.

   Block after devastated block of this farming
town told Thursday of the visit by a tornado. But siren blasts gave
the 1,800 residents here precious minutes to take shelter, and none
was killed.
   Three guests at the Lariat Hotel piled into a bathtub and pulled
a mattress over them when the tornado siren sounded at dusk
Wednesday.
   ``We were doing a lot of praying in that bathtub,'' said David
Thomas, who shared the cramped quarters with Arley Boston and Carl
Riley.
   The tornado tore their room apart.
   ``It felt like somebody just reached down and squeezed your whole
body. My eardrums were coming out,'' Thomas said.
   Town Clerk Teresa O'Dwyer said she ran to Town Hall when the
siren sounded and put the town records in the vault.
   Minutes later, the tornado ripped the front off the building.
   As residents began picking up the pieces Thursday, officials
toured this town about 80 miles southeast of Denver.
   Streets were cluttered with metal, wood and other debris left by
the tornado that hopscotched down Main Street shortly after 8 p.m.,
yanking down walls and roofs, overturning rail cars and smashing a
grain silo as if it were a soda can.
   Business owners stood guard against looters, and dozens of police
patrolled.
   Among the devastation, people marveled that no one died.
   ``We're lucky to be alive,'' said Angie Spencer, cradling her cat
in her arms as she surveyed what was left of her house.
   ``We went underneath the house and under a crawlspace and it
sounded like an earthquake. We just heard everything rumbling and
ripping and when we got out, everything was gone.''
   Gov. Roy Romer estimated damage between $20 million and $40
million. He said about 90 percent of the businesses and government
offices were damaged or destroyed, and about half the town's 750
homes.
   Romer said he would seek federal disaster aid for the town.
   At least 12 people were injured, but just two remained
hospitalized Thursday, one in fair condition and one listed as
stable.
   Lincoln County Sheriff Leroy Yowell was driving down Main Street
when he saw the tornado looming behind him.
   ``It was huge,'' he said. ``We drove to the east edge of town and
hid behind a building until it passed.''
   Yowell and other residents alerted the Colorado State Patrol,
which sounded the civil defense siren, giving people five to six
minutes' warning the tornado was headed their way.
   The tornado moved through town from south to northeast in a wide
``S.''
   While some residents complained the siren was drowned out by
hail, many credited the warning system with saving lives.
   Some said they hadn't even needed it.
   ``You could hear it coming and when the glass started tinkling,
we all ran for the basement. I don't know why somebody didn't get
killed,'' said Russ Covington, a Lincoln County commissioner.
   The tornado halted water, electricity and telephones, but crews
restored at least limited supplies of all three services Thursday.
   Relief efforts were launched by state and federal agencies. A
makeshift grocery store was set up in the high school.
   Len Boulas, an operations officer with the state Division of
Emergency Services, said a final damage assessment would take two to
three days.
   The American Red Cross fed about 2,000 storm victims, volunteers
and cleanup workers Thursday, and helped concerned relatives find
loved ones.
   The Limon tornado was one of at least nine reported to the
National Weather Service Wednesday.

Compromise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Senate supporters of a wide-ranging crime bill
with curbs on semiautomatic assault weapons scrambled to save the
measure Thursday after efforts to stop a filibuster fell short.
   ``I think we can work it out,'' Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said
after senators of both parties called for a compromise version shorn
of a number of the troublesome provisions.
   Republicans were weighing a plan to retain the bill's provisions
to put curbs on nine semiautomatic assault weapons, overhaul the
criminal appeals system, establish the death penalty for 30 federal
offenses and fine-tune money laundering laws.
   Under the plan, the bill would be stripped of provisions to allow
courts to consider evidence gathered with flawed warrants and to set
up an organized crime and drug division in the Justice Department.
   After caucusing on the scheme _ which also would allow 12
amendments on each side _ Republican leaders walked down the hall
and met with their Democratic counterparts but emerged without any
commitments. The two sides did agree to explore the proposal next
week.
   Democratic leaders blamed pressure from the National Rifle
Association for the Senate's refusal to limit debate on the current
version.
   They first pronounced the bill dead after the Senate voted 57-37
in favor of limiting debate, three votes short of the number needed.
   But then after an overture from Thurmond they called for talks
aimed at reaching such a compromise.
   ``The only way we're really likely to get a bill is if we can
enter into negotiations,'' said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.
   Much of the discussion of the bill has focused on its ban on the
manufacture or importation of nine kinds of semiautomatic assault
rifles, but it contains other significant provisions as well.
   The legislation contains remnants of President Bush's crime
program, sent to Capitol Hill a year ago, but has been largely
rewritten since then and few of its provisions now find favor with
the administration.
   Under various provisions:
   _ The death penalty would be established for 30 specific federal
crimes.
   _ Courts would be able to consider evidence gathered with flawed
warrants in some case.
   _ An end would be sought to long delays _ up to a decade in some
cases _ in carrying out executions.
   Democratic leaders said they needed to limit debate because of
300 pending amendments that could delay passage indefinitely. The
time limit sought by Democratic leaders would have squeezed action
on all amendments and the overall bill into 30 hours.
   On the roll call, 11 Republicans joined 46 Democrats in voting
for a time limit. Seven Democrats and 30 Republicans opposed it.
   That gave bill sponsors three more votes than they gained Tuesday
when they made their first run at a time limit but still not enough.
   Biden blamed the NRA for the proliferation of amendments. ``The
NRA says this bill they want to kill because it contains guns,'' he
declared.
   Indeed, in the days before the vote the NRA sent messages from
Executive Director Wayne LaPierre to gun owners in eight states,
urging them to put pressure on their senators.
   One mailed to South Dakota ripped into Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D.,
saying the gun provisions had survived in an earlier skirmish by one
vote.
   ``Tom Daschle betrayed every honest gun owner in South Dakota by
voting for it ... because Daschle bought the big anti-gun media lie
that gun control equals crime control'' and ``has now joined Ted
Kennedy and the national gun ban crowd ...''
   It urged gun owners to call Daschle's offices in Aberdeen, Rapid
City and Sioux Falls and provided the phone numbers. Messages with
the names of other senators and similar accusations were mailed into
a number of other states.
   Daschle responded by telling South Dakotans that ``as a hunter
and a gun owner, I am against gun control period.''
   ``Let's be realistic,'' he said. ``Taking a couple of very small
steps to try to deal with the drug killers who use these assault
weapons is not going to hurt a single, law abiding South Dakota
sportsman.''
   Also, Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell said he had
received phone calls because of a letter sent to Maine gun owners by
the NRA. ``They have certainly been critical of me in the past,'' he
said, though he added that he has generally supported their stands.
   ``Many of their statements have been false and misleading,'' he
said.
   However, some lawmakers who voted against cutting short debate
scoffed at the notion that fear of NRA retaliation at re-election
time was the reason. ``It wasn't in my case _ I'm leaving here,''
said retiring Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.
   He said was against the measure because its ``habeas corpus''
provisions designed to end delays in carrying out executions were
not written properly.
   NRA lobbyist David Conover said in an interview Wednesday that
``we weren't out in the halls ... but we had mail out, which I think
most people would say is our most effective way of communicating.''
   He said the gun group's members may have grown complacent prior
to a vote two weeks ago in which the Senate narrowly rejected a move
to strip gun curbs out of the bill. He said that action created
``renewed energy among NRA members and gun owners.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush, on a political tour of the
Midwest Thursday, called Mikhail Gorbachev a ``remarkable man'' and
said the Soviet president's forthright summit manner proves there is
a ``new era'' in U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``Of course, we have differences,'' said Bush, specifying
Lithuanian self-determination, the emigration rights of Soviet Jews,
a unified Germany as a NATO member and the continued totalitarian
regime in Cuba.
   ``These aren't questions that can be solved simply, or in a
single summit,'' Bush told a fundraising luncheon for Wisconsin Gov.
Tommy Thompson.
   Bush summarized the outcome of a ``very productive summit'' as he
began a two-day speaking trip on behalf of GOP Senate and
gubernatorial candidates.
   He later flew to Illinois, and from there was headed to Iowa and
Nebraska.
   In Chicago, Bush told a Republican fundraising event, ``I believe
last week's summit can alter history.''
   Of the long-term grain agreement that he and Gorbachev signed,
which should increase U.S. grain sales to the Soviet Union by one
million tons annually, Bush said, ``It will bring bread to Soviet
consumers and business to the farmers of Illinois.''
   Several hundred people carrying Lithuanian and other Baltic
states flags demonstrated outside the Chicago hotel where Bush
spoke. The president took note of the demonstrators in his speech,
telling his audience the protesters were ``all decent and honorable
people.''
   The president said he, too, supports the self-determination
rights of citizens of the Baltic republics. ``There's no difference
between us at all on that,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the White House hailed the decision by South African
President F.W. de Klerk to lift a four-year-old state of emergency,
calling the move ``another significant step toward creating a
climate conducive to negotiations that will lead to a democratic,
non-racial South Africa.''
   The statement, issued by deputy White House press secretary Alixe
Glen aboard Air Force One en route to Milwaukee, said the
announcement ``builds on earlier decisions by President de Klerk''
toward more open and free political debate.
   Bush has invited both de Klerk and freed black nationalist leader
Nelson Mandela to the White House. Mandela will visit on June 25, de
Klerk at a later, yet to-be-announced date.
   ``Much work remains to be done by all sides,'' the White House
statement continued. ``However, we are encouraged by the remarkable
progress that has been made in recent months. ... We look forward to
the early beginning of a negotiating process,'' it added.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher noted
that the administration cannot legally modify U.S. sanctions against
South Africa until certain conditions are met.
   Boucher said U.S. law requires that the state of emergency be
lifted, among other measures, before the sanctions can be eased.
Left unanswered for the time being, he said, is the impact on the
legislation of the de Klerk's decision to lift the state of
emergency in all but one province, Natal.
   Boucher added that the lifting of the sanctions must also await
the release of all political prisoners in South Africa. ``This has
not yet happened,'' he said.
   Bush, in his first speech since the superpower summit that ended
Sunday, told his Milwaukee audience, ``As I chatted informally with
President Gorbachev at Camp David, I kept thinking that this new
Soviet leader, committed to reform and openness, is indeed a
remarkable man.''
   ``I'm grateful to Mr. Gorbachev for the forthright spirit in
which he addressed every issue on the table,'' Bush said. ``And I
take it as proof that we have indeed entered a new era in our
relations with the USSR.''
   Bush listed progress toward an agreement to limit nuclear
missiles, a cutback in chemical weapons stockpiles, an agreement on
nuclear testing and pacts on trade and grain sales as the key
accomplishments of last week's meetings.
   Overall, Bush said, ``It was a good summit.''
   Bush said his administration's top trade priority is to conclude
international trade talks by year's end.
   The United States is seeking the removal of European farm export
subsidies over 10 years at the talks, which have been underway in
Geneva for nearly two years.
   ``And let me tell you: any trade agreement we sign will be an
agreement that's good for the American farmer,'' he said.
   Gov. Thompson, an early supporter of Bush's 1988 presidential
campaign, is waging a well-funded re-election bid against four-term
Democratic Assembly Speaker Thomas Loftus.
   After Milwaukee, Bush was travelling to Chicago to lend support
to the Illinois gubernatorial candidacy of Republican Secretary of
State Jim Edgar, who is battling Democratic state Attorney General
Neil Hartigan to succeed outgoing Gov. James R. Thompson, a
Republican.
   The party hopes the president's campaign efforts in Illinois also
will help Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., in her battle against incumbent
Democratic Sen. Paul Simon.
   Bush also was to speak to a group of students at a Chicago
elementary school and participate in a National Literacy Week
program.
   On Friday, Bush will be in Des Moines for incumbent Iowa Gov.
Terry Branstad. He will also appear at an Omaha luncheon for GOP
Senate contender Hal Daub, who is challenging Democratic incumbent
Sen. James Exon, R-Neb.

   Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have
shown that a candidate vaccine produced by genetic engineering
fights the virus that produces AIDS, according to a report published
Thursday.
   The vaccine uses gene-splicing techniques to produce a chain of
proteins mimicking a portion of the surface of the the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS.
   Vaccines against viruses usually are made of the whole virus,
crippled so that it cannot cause the disease in question, or killed
virus.
   Writing in Science, the journal of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science, the Johns Hopkins team said, ``although
the induction of virus-specific ... (virus-fighting) responses is
traditionally associated with attenuated live-virus vaccines, our
results demonstrate that envelope protein subunit vaccines, which
have greater inherent simplicity and safety, may also induce'' the
desired activity.
   The candidate vaccine was injected into eight volunteers four
times over 18 months _ an initial injection followed by three
boosters.
   At the end of 18 months, three of the eight had developed a
response in which the cells of their immune systems attacked the HIV
virus and the cells it infected.
   They did so without attacking the so-called ``innocent
bystander'' uninfected cells of the immune system, a major problem
in AIDS research.
   The test vaccine is a long way from being shown to be a possible
weapon against AIDS. Further clinical tests, which could take years
to complete, must be conducted before the vaccine could be used.
   Other vaccines also are being tested at other labs in which
portions of the AIDS virus proteins are being used to try to trigger
an immune response.
   The Johns Hopkins team was led by Rimas J. Orentas of the
Baltimore institution's department of pharmacology and molecular
sciences and included James E.K. Hildreth, Eugene Obah, Michael
Polydefkis, Gale E. Smith, Mary Lou Clements and Robert F. Siliciano.

   The National Rifle Association opens its
annual convention in an unfriendly state Friday, hoping to restore
its influence after losses in membership and legislative defeats
across the country.
   An estimated 20,000 members will attend the convention in
California, which last year bucked the gun lobby and passed
legislation banning more than 50 types of military-style assault
rifles.
   The organization _ which also has suffered legislative defeats in
California, New Jersey, Maryland and Florida _ won at least a
temporary victory Thursday when the U.S. Senate failed to stop a
filibuster on a broad anti-crime bill with new restrictions on
semiautomatic weapons.
   Democratic leaders, blaming the NRA for their failure, at first
decided the bill was dead, then sought a compromise to revive the
measure.
   NRA lobbyist James J. Baker claimed the Senate action showed the
NRA retains some legislative clout.
   ``We've lost some battles. The war is far from over,'' Baker
said. ``You look at the votes in the United States Senate this
morning and I think that gives you the proof that you need based on
the fact that they decided a crime bill that contains a
semiautomatic firearms bill would not go forward.''
   NRA leaders expect to hear complaints about about the
organization's legislative defeats, and have scheduled a meeting
Saturday to field questions from the rank and file about them.
   ``I think there's a great deal of frustration among the
membership based on a very tough year,'' Baker said. ``...I think
that you're going to see that frustration played out at the annual
membership meeting.''
   The convention comes at a crucial time in the history of the 2.8
million-member organization. Along with legislative defeats, the NRA
has lost support among law enforcement and has lost 240,000 members
in four years.
   Baker attributed some of the membership loss to a $10 increase in
dues in recent years. Opponents of the NRA see a badly damaged
organization.
   ``The National Rifle Association has suffered enormous losses,''
said Luis Tolley, western director of Handgun Control Inc. ``Over
the last 12 months you're looking at the worst period in the NRA's
existence.''
   The NRA faces divisions in its own ranks between members who feel
the group has gone too far and members who want the NRA to push
harder against gun control.
   One of the NRA's biggest losses was in the California Legislature
last year when lawmakers passed and Republican Gov. George
Deukmejian signed a bill banning many kinds of assault rifles.
   The bill was introduced after five children were slain and 29
others were wounded in a schoolyard by a man with an assault rifle.
The man, Patrick Purdy, killed himself at the end of the Jan. 17,
1989, attack in Stockton.
   California also now requires a 15-day waiting period for the
purchase of rifles and shotguns.
   Elsewhere, Maryland voters approved a referendum in 1988 that
bans sale and manufacture of cheap handguns known as Saturday night
specials.
   This year in New Jersey, Gov. James Florio signed what he called
the nation's strongest ban on sale and possession of assault weapons.
   One NRA problem in fighting gun controls has been loss of support
among police. Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and Los
Angeles Police Chief Darryl Gates speak in favor of legislation
banning assault weapons.
   Gun control advocates say the NRA has gone too far in its
lobbying.
   ``Five or 10 years ago you wouldn't have seen the police doing
what they're doing now,'' said Tolley. ``The NRA has gone off the
deep end.''
   Baker acknowledged that loss of law enforcement groups hurt but
he contends the NRA has only lost support among police leadership
groups.
   ``By and large, the rank and file law enforcement officers, the
officer that walks the beat, that comes into contact with the
criminal element in this country, supports the position that gun
control laws do not do anything to deter criminals,'' he said.
   The convention features vendors pushing shotguns, handguns,
bullets, crossbows, bulletproof vests, air guns, boots and
camouflage jackets.

<HEAD>U.S. Major Says Chief Salvadoran Investigator Impeded Jesuit
Inquiry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Army major testified the
Salvadoran colonel heading the inquiry into the murder of six Jesuit
priests knew who was responsible weeks before he told senior
authorities, the Supreme Court reported Thursday.
   The court also confirmed that military log books considered key
evidence in the case were burned by one of the defendants, on orders
from a higher officer.
   A court communique said that Judge Ricardo Zamora, who is
investigating the Jesuit slayings, formally included as evidence a
sworn declaration from the major. It did not name the major, but he
has been identified as Eric Buckland, who until January was part of
the U.S. Military Group here.
   Buckland told the same thing to a U.S. congressional commission
studying the Jesuit slayings. The commission's report was released
April 30.
   Buckland's testimony gained significance for being formally
included as evidence.
   He testified that Col. Carlos Aviles told him Dec. 20 of the
involvement of Col. Guillermo Benavides in the massacre of the
Jesuits, their housekeeper and her daughter. The eight were killed
before dawn Nov. 16 on the campus of Central American University,
where the Jesuits taught.
   Buckland said Aviles based his assertion on a conversation with
another Salvadoran colonel, Ivan Lopez y Lopez.
   Lopez y Lopez had been told by Col. Manuel Rivas, the head of the
U.S.-funded Special Investigative Unit investigating the massacre,
said Buckland in his statement.
   According to this version, Benavides admitted his involvement to
Rivas, asking the investigating colonel, ``What can you do to help
me?''
   According to Buckland's version of events, at least three
Salvadoran colonels _ Aviles, Lopez y Lopez and Rivas _ lied to U.S.
and Salvadoran authorities looking into the killing of the Jesuits.
   Aviles has denied telling Buckland about any conversation between
Benavides and Rivas and has been called by Zamora to provide sworn
testimony.
   Both Aviles and Buckland took lie detector tests in January.
According to the U.S. congressional commission, ``The polygraph
results indicated some deception in both cases.''
   In conversations with members of the congressional commission,
Rivas and Lopez y Lopez denied Buckland's allegations. Both refused
to take lie detector tests.
   After being briefed by Rivas' investigative unit, President
Alfredo Cristiani announced Jan. 7 that military personnel were
involved in the Jesuits' massacre. On Jan. 13, he said Benavides,
three lieutenants and five other soldiers had been charged in the
crime.
   One, a private, is a fugitive.
   The Supreme Court confirmed the 1989 log books of the Military
College, where the unit that killed the Jesuits was temporarily
based, were burned by Lt. Rene Mendoza in mid-December.
   Mendoza is a defendant in the murder case.
   The court communique said Mendoza testified he burned the books
on orders from then-Maj. Camilo Hernandez, who then was subdirector
of the Military College .

   Barbara Bush, on the eve of her 65th birthday,
said Thursday that she ``couldn't care less'' about the milestone.
   ``I had a very good week, and I plan to have a great week next
week, too,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   ``I felt all of America had a great week last week,'' she said,
reflecting on the recent superpower summit.
   Mrs. Bush spent part of Thursday in a salute to 25 local children
who read hundreds of books to raise money for the March of Dimes. As
she left the event at The Washington Post, a reporter asked her
feelings on turning 65.
   ``Ohhhhhh!'' she groaned, as if hammered by a verbal blow. But
she quickly added with a laugh: ``I couldn't care less. No, I have
no feelings about it.''
   Mrs. Bush is coming off the most celebrated event of her 14-plus
months in the White House: last Friday's nationally televised
address to the Wellesley graduates, some of whom had questioned the
wisdom of honoring the president's homemaker wife.
   But her witty address, a mixture of disarming humor and candid
advice about not letting careers crowd out family, charmed the women
graduates, who gave a tumultuous welcome to both Mrs. Bush and Raisa
Gorbachev.
   Afterward, they were cheered by crowds in the town of Wellesley
and a park in Boston, as Mrs. Bush took her guest arm-in-arm on a
quick sightseeing tour of the city.
   ``I was really proud of the Wellesley girls and Boston,'' she
said. ``I was really proud that we could show Raisa that kind of
(welcome). The only problem was she wanted to thank each one
personally.''
   President Bush, in a fund-raising speech in Chicago, let everyone
know Thursday night he had not forgotten his wife's birthday. He
said he was just on the phone ``to tomorrow's birthday girl, the one
who did so well at Wellesley.''
   He said he had called British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to
discuss last week's summit conference with Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev: ``But she didn't want to talk about the Gorbachev summit.
She wanted to talk _ because she'd seen live on television over
there, she'd seen Barbara Bush speaking at Wellesley. So I was very
proud of her assessment of what went on.''
   Mrs. Bush draped ribbons around the necks of the schoolchildren
dubbed the local March of Dimes' ``reading champions.'' The top
reader was Nicholas Daly, 9, of Beltsville, Md., who read 435 books
in a single month.
   Nicholas said the reading marathon left him little time for video
games or television. The 4th grader said his favorite book was ``The
Paper Crane.''
   The 25 youngsters read more than 6,000 books and raised $1,200
for the March of Dimes fight against birth defects.
   Overall, 800 children taking part in the contest raised more than
$14,000, which will be used for a campaign to encourage women to
avoid drugs, alcohol and cigarettes during pregnancy.
   Friday is not only Mrs. Bush's birthday, but also National Read
Aloud Day.
   Mrs. Bush will mark that event by reading aloud to children on
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' and later by reading to
second-graders at a library in suburban District Heights, Md.
   President Bush 66 turns Tuesday. He will return Friday evening to
the White House, where the Bushes plan a private dinner for West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

   A man accused of absconding eight years ago
with $267,000 from his New York church said Thursday he left because
of ``industrial espionage,'' and hadn't stolen anything.
   ``I didn't know I was a fugitive until Monday night,'' said Clyde
M. Womer, 67, in a rambling interview at the Taos County Jail.
   Womer disappeared from Rockland County north of New York City in
January 1982, leaving behind a wife and five children. A few days
later, $267,000 was discovered missing from the Christ Episcopalian
Church of Ramapo, N.Y., of which he was treasurer. He was arrested
Monday.
   He has lived in Taos since 1983, known as Lawrence Howard
``Howie'' Krantz, a quiet, friendly retired man who sometimes helped
build fixtures in the local J.C. Penney store managed by the woman
he married in 1984.
   Womer acknowledged having transferred money from church accounts
to his own bank accounts in New York.
   But he said the transfers were not theft, and said he had had
reasons for making them, which he could not discuss.
   He told a story that he acknowledged ``sounds screwy,'' about a
chemical manufacturing process he developed and sold _ he wouldn't
say to whom.
   He referred to ``industrial espionage'' and said he had been
advised to leave Suffern and change his name _ he wouldn't say by
whom. He said Lawrence Krantz is the name of his son-in-law from his
first marriage.
   He said he came to New Mexico with around $300,000 in cash from
selling the chemical process.
   Womer said he felt all right about leaving his first wife and
children because after years of commuting into New York City, he had
become estranged from them.
   He said he committed only two crimes: applying for a New Mexico
driver's license under a name that wasn't his own, and marrying
again.
   He called it ``plain, pure stupidity'' not to have told his
second wife, Betty Sutton, who he really was.
   ``I'm sorry for the hurt that I've caused other people,'' he said.
   Sutton refused to be interviewed Thursday, saying only, ``I've
had a bomb dropped this week.''
   She said Wednesday she was aware the man she knew as Krantz had
been married before and had five children, but said she was told his
first wife died of cancer.
   ``This is the last thing I would have thought,'' she said. ``You
never think something like this will happen to you.''
   The Rev. John Andrews, rector of the New York church, said he had
had personality conflicts with Womer and wanted him relieved as
treasurer, but hadn't known money was missing. Andrews, who came
here to identify Womer, said he tried to talk with him but Womer
turned his back.
   Suffern police detective Sgt. Leo Costa, who also came here to
identify Womer, said Wednesday that Womer's first wife, Harriet, now
lives in Colorado Springs, Colo., and that their children are grown.
He said she was ``pretty upset when she learned he was married in
New Mexico.''
   Costa said Mrs. Womer had been filing papers to declare her
husband dead so she could get Social Security payments.
   Andrews said Mrs. Womer was in the Taos J.C. Penney store a year
ago while on vacation but hadn't knowingly seen her husband.
   Last month, a vacationing member of the New York church spotted
Womer in the store and tipped authorities.
   Womer waived extradition to New York, where he faces three counts
each of second- and third-degree grand larceny. He is to be escorted
there Friday and arraigned Monday.
   Rockland County District Attorney Kenneth Gribetz said Womer, an
investment adviser and small business entrepreneur, persuaded church
members to put funds into liquid accounts which he controlled. Womer
then ``systematically looted'' the church accounts, depositing the
money in his own account, Gribetz said.
   He said Womer withdrew the money $5,000 at a time from New York
City banks and transferred it to banks in Albuquerque.
   He said Womer's assets were seized, but could not list them.

<HEAD>More Names of Alleged Nazi War Criminals Submitted to Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nazi hunters on Thursday submitted the names of
nine more alleged war criminals living in Britain to the government
and protested a House of Lords vote that killed a bill to prosecute
such suspects.
   Efraim Zuroff, coordinator of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Nazi
War Crimes Center in Jerusalem, said he ``emphasized our sense of
frustration and disappointment with what has happened to the bill''
when he provided the latest names to the Home Office.
   ``We talked about the possibilities of deportation,
denaturalization and extradition,'' said Zuroff, who came to London
to see the House of Lords vote Tuesday.
   He said the Wiesenthal Center, which is based in Los Angeles,
wants to make sure if the bill is not reintroduced, ``there will be
some alternative so these people are not granted a safe haven in
Britain.''
   Britain is the only World War II ally without laws to prosecute
suspected war criminals.
   The government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had backed the
bill, which was also passed by a large majority in the lower,
elected House of Commons. Government officials could force the
proposal through the unelected House of Lords by reintroducing it in
the fall, but they have not yet announced their decision.
   The nine new names bring the total number of alleged war
criminals living in Britain to 136.
   The failed bill followed an inquiry by a government-appointed
commission that said there was enough evidence to prosecute three
suspects for murder and investigate 124 others.
   A Home Office spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Thursday the latest names were received, but the government can
investigate no further without a law allowing prosecution.
   Zuroff said names of alleged war criminals came from testimony of
survivors in Lithuanian Jewish communities where nearly 250,000 Jews
were killed during World War II. He added that more names were
likely to result from further research in Israel.
   About 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust.

   A middle-aged woman with a wad of dollar
bills in her hand hesitated Thursday before knocking on the door of
a white-frame bungalow adorned with yellow ribbons and balloons.
   Inside, Roy and Marge Heimdal huddled with their two daughters as
friends and strangers alike scrambled to gather the $60,000 ransom
they hope will save the Heimdal's 27-year-old son, Scott, from South
American kidnappers.
   ``This is for your son,'' the woman said as she quickly the money.
   ``Can I get your name?'' Heimdal, 52, asked the woman.
   ``It doesn't matter,'' she responded.
   The Heimdals hoped to wire the money to Ecuador by Friday in
order to make the kidnapper's Monday deadline. The money will be
given to an unidentified intermediary who will carry it into the
jungles along the Ecuador-Colombia border, where their son, Scott,
disappeared April 28.
   Scott Heimdal, an engineer for a gold-mining company near Quito,
Ecuador, was traveling by boat when it was ambushed by Maoist
insurgents who killed the boat pilot, wounded a passenger, and
kidnapped Heimdal and an Ecuadoran student.
   The kidnappers subsequently released the student with two letters
written by Heimdal, one to his family and the other to his company
Iminco Co. The letters' contents were not revealed.
   The kidnappers have several several photographs of Heimdal to
prove he was alive.
   One of them, shown to reporters Thursday by Jeffrey Fino, manager
of the mining company that employs Heimdal, shows the captive
sitting down, encircled by several armed men.
   The elder Heimdal said the photo appeared similar to pictures the
family had seen previously.
   U.S. and Ecuadoran officials refused to comment on negotiations
between the kidnappers and family.
   A U.S. diplomatic source said Heimdal was in Colombian territory.
``We assume that his life is in danger,'' said the source, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Mrs. Heimdal, 47, said the kidnappers, reportedly members of a
Colombian guerrilla group known as the Popular Liberation Army, have
threatened to ``show us where his body is'' unless they get paid.
   ``It's not easy to strip your soul in front of the whole
country,'' Mrs. Heimdal said. ``We're trying to keep our dignity.
But we had no other way to save our son than to go public like this.
Our fear is so big right now.''
   On Wednesday, State Department spokesman Dave Denny said the
family was advised not to pay any ransom, in keeping with U.S.
policy, ``but families are free to do what they must do.''
   Since the Heimdals went public, the people of Peoria and
elsewhere have been offering help.
   ``I've been following their story in the paper,'' said Oscar
Boehl, who delivered a few dollars in his pickup truck. ``This is
the kind of story that gets anybody. Or it should. I'm not wealthy,
but everyone can kick in a few bucks. Every little bit helps.''
   Steakhouses, taverns and sandwich shops have joined the cause to
raise ransom money. Nursing homes have held bake sales and
waitresses have donated their tips.
   About $35,000 had been raised by Thursday night, the missing
man's father said.
   For the Heimdals, the kidnapping is just the most recent in a
string of personal problems.
   In 1981, when Peoria's economy plunged into deep recession,
Heimdal was forced to leave the real estate business, his line of
work since 1969. The family moved to Chetek, Wis., opening a cabinet
business and flower shop.
   Then in 1983 Mrs. Heimdal was critically injured in a wreck with
a drunken driver. She suffered head and back injuries, and memory
loss. Her injuries required her to be hospitalized for most of two
years.
   Medical bills surpassed $300,000 and when their insurance ran
out, the family was forced to sell everything to pay the bills.
   ``I can't remember my kids as babies and my speech was
affected,'' Mrs. Heimdal said. ``We sold everything and moved back
to Peoria in 1988.''
   Heimdal still works in the cabinet business and Mrs. Heimdal is
active in Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
   The family maintains faith that their son will return home safely.
   ``My dream is coming home on a plane with Scott and being met at
the Peoria airport by hundreds of people and all of them holding
yellow ribbons,'' Mrs. Heimdal said. ``Scott belongs to this
community now. They are fighting for his life, just like we are.''

<TEXT>
   About 100 fake pictographs were removed
from the fragile limestone walls of a Mojave Desert cavern once used
by American Indians for religious ceremonies, authorities said.
   ``The work has been completed and there is no damage,'' said
Larry Cermak, chief of the Mojave District of the state Department
of Parks and Recreation, which manages the Mitchell Caverns Natural
Preserve.
   An artist working with film director Oliver Stone painted the
fake pictographs for a scene in ``The Doors,'' an upcoming movie
about rock legend Jim Morrison.
   Actor Val Kilmer, portraying Morrison, wanders about the
250-foot-long Tecopa Cave in a hallucinatory state and meets a holy
man. The scene called for Morrison to study Indian pictographs.
   State parks officials required the artist to use a powdery
substance that could be vacuumed off afterward. But someone
apparently used water in the process, causing the substance to seep
into the limestone, authorities said.
   Mitchell Caverns, about 35 miles west of Needles, is known for
its spectacular stalagmite, stalactite and other mineral formations
created several million years ago. About 10,000 people visit the
caves each year.
   For 500 years, the caves were used by the Chemehuevi Indians for
shelter and ceremonial purposes.
   Needles is near the California-Arizona border, about 225 miles
east of downtown Los Angeles.

   Mrs. Watson said her pregnancy wouldn't affect her ability to act

<HEAD>France Announces Nuclear Test in South Pacific</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Ministry announced Thursday that France
exploded its second nuclear device in a week at the testing site
under Mururoa atoll in the South Pacific.
   The explosion, early Friday South Pacific time, drew immediate
fire from Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer of New Zealand, who said
France seemed determined to continue testing no matter what it cost
in terms of relations with the South Pacific.
   The blast released a force of less than 12 kilotons, the ministry
said in a communique. That is slightly more than half the power of
the World War II bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
   A kiloton is equal to the explosive force of 1,000 tons of TNT.
   On Saturday, France made its first announcement of a nuclear
explosion in 15 years after detonating a 15-kiloton device.
President Francois Mitterrand pledged a new policy of openness last
month during a visit to French Polynesia.
   The world previously learned of French tests from New Zealand,
which has monitored France's nuclear program from an observation
station in the Cook Islands.
   Palmer commented on Friday, ``From New Zealand's point of view,
the only announcement we want to hear is that they are stopping
testing.''
   He said, ``They already know that their nuclear tests are
rejected by all countries of the region. However, we will continue
to make this point unmistakably clear every time they explode one of
their nuclear devices.''
   Premier Michel Rocard said recently France would reduce the
number of nuclear tests each year at Mururoa from eight to six.

   Jesse Jackson met with Marion Barry Thursday
and said later the embattled mayor was ``open to talks'' on a plea
bargain agreement on his drug and perjury charges.
   Meanwhile, jury selection dragged on for a fourth day in U.S.
District Court, and it is expected to continue well into next week.
   Jackson, in a televised interview, said of Barry, ``He is open to
talks as opposed to a drawing-the-line situation. ... I am rather
convinced the mayor is inclined to ... do something to break the
cycle and break the tension.''
   At the same time, Barry's spokeswoman, Lurma Rackley, said the
mayor had no intention of announcing in the next day or two that he
would not seek re-election. She said she asked Barry about reports
to that effect, and he told her, ``If you hold your breath, you'll
die.''
   Negotiations leading to a guilty plea on one or more of the 14
charges Barry faces have stalled, according to sources close to
Barry's legal team.
   ``We're nowhere right now,'' said one source familiar with the
negotiations between Barry attorney R. Kenneth Mundy and U.S.
Attorney Jay B. Stephens. ``It's increasingly unlikely that we will
have any agreement soon,'' said the source, who commented only on
condition of anonymity.
   Talk of a possible plea bargain dominated attention at the trial
Wednesday after Jackson publicly urged Barry to announce he would
not run for a fourth term. Jackson suggested such a statement would
nudge prosecutors toward allowing Barry to plead guilty to a
drug-possession misdemeanor rather than one of the three perjury
felony counts he faces.
   Pleading guilty to a felony would bar Barry from holding office
or running for re-election and would make a jail sentence more
likely.
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor charges of
cocaine possession, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge, and
three felony counts of lying to a federal grand jury about his
alleged drug use.
   Meanwhile, Jackson associates said the civil rights leader and
former Democratic presidential hopeful has been urging Barry
privately for six weeks to abandon his re-election plans and seek a
plea bargain agreement.
   According to sources close to both men, Barry wants Jackson to
run for mayor if he steps aside, and Jackson does not want to do so.
   However, Barry's spokeswoman later denied that the mayor was
urging Jackson to succeed him. ``That's totally, totally untrue,''
Ms. Rackley said.
   Jackson, who moved to Washington last year, flirted with a
candidacy before announcing in February he would not run for mayor.
   Mundy would not comment on the plea bargain issue during a lunch
break from the jury selection process of the trial.
   In court, questioning of prospective jurors continued slowly.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is going
alphabetically through a list of more than 200 people who have
filled out questionnaires for the Barry case. Jackson plans to
review all 200-plus applications and have lawyers for the two sides
question them rather than stopping with a pool of 40 to 45 people as
is more customary.
   The shorter approach for picking a jury pool _ from which a panel
of 12 jurors and six alternates would be chosen _ was used in the
recent high-profile trials of Oliver North and John Poindexter.
Jackson himself used such an approach in the case of former White
House aide Michael Deaver.
   In the Barry case, 37 people have been sent into the jury pool so
far.
   Also on Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union said it will
file a brief with the judge asking him to reject any plea bargain
that includes Barry's resignation.

   FBI agents arrested a former soldier in Tampa,
Fla. Thursday on spying charges, FBI headquarters said Thursday
night.
   The arrested man, Roderick James Ramsay, was accused of supplying
military secrets of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to a
foreign country while serving in 8th Infantry Division headquarters
at Bad Kreuznach, West Germany, said the FBI announcement.
   The case was an outgrowth of the invesigation of Clyde Lee
Conrad, a retired U.S. Army sergeant convicted of treason by a West
German court earlier this week and sentenced to life in prison, the
FBI said.

   Demonstrators, some dressed as trees,
launched Redwood Summer on Thursday with a protest at a
lumber-export company, promising to ``put their bodies on the line''
to block cutting of virgin timber.
   The 50 demonstrators were matched one-for-one by police who are
on edge because of a bombing that injured two members of Earth
First!, the group organizing the summer of protest.
   The demonstrators gathered at the Port of Sacramento outside Gene
West Inc., which exports logs to China, Korea, and Japan.
   Speakers, some in tree garb, decried what they said is
over-harvesting of timber and cutting of old-growth redwoods. They
said logging companies are racing deadlines, including environmental
protection measures on California's November ballot and possiblity
that logging of redwoods could be curtailed by an endangered-species
designation for the spotted owl, which lives among the big trees.
   ``Over 150 acres of old-growth timber a day are being cut. It's
time for us to stop asking and start demanding that they stop it,''
said David Orr, 32, a University of California at Davis employee.
``Earth First! participants are willing to put their bodies on the
line to stop the devastation.''
   Protesters' varied ranks stretched from students to housewives,
and from perennial activists to environmental demonstration
newcomers.
   ``I am not a liberal. I have a job. I am a mainstream American
and I am equally concerned about our resources,'' said Edwin Reidel,
a 21-year-old college student with trim hair and wearing a suit.
``This is no joke. The time has come for everyone to express their
concern.''
   Between speakers, demonstrators waved a large American flag and
chanted such slogans as, ``Save our forests,'' and, ``No more
exports.'' They held hand-fashioned signs that said: ``Logs are
jobs. Keep 'em here,'' ``Stop log exports,'' and ``Support
sustainable yield.''
   A spokesman for the port said Gene West Inc. exports only
low-quality white fir and diseased trees, taken from the Sierra
Nevada, that would not normally be milled in the United States
anyway.
   Protesters had planned to interfere with loading of logs aboard a
ship bound for Japan, but the vessel left Wednesday, port officials
said.
   The environmentalists are planning widespread protests in coming
months called Redwood Summer.
   The Earth First! organizers said they hope to reproduce the
environmental equivalent of Freedom Summer, the 1964 voter
registration campaign centered in Mississippi that ld to the 1965
Voting Rights Act. That summer was marked by violence, including the
murder of three civil rights workers near Philadelphia, Miss.

   Kidnappers have released a photograph of an
American mining engineer, surrounded in the jungle by armed guards,
and are demanding $60,000 ransom for his safe return.
   Scott Heimdal, 27, was abducted April 28 in a boat near the
Colombian border and is believed held in Colombian territory.
Members of his family in Peoria, Ill., say the kidnappers,
reportedly leftist Colombian guerrillas, are demanding the money by
Monday.
   The manager of the mining company where Heimdal worked said
Thursday that the kidnappers and representatives from Heimdal's
family have met five times, and he said without elaboration that
negotiations were going well.
   The manager, Jeffrey Fino, showed a color photograph of Heimdal
sent by the kidnappers to show he is alive. In the photo, Heimdal is
sitting down, encircled by several armed men. He appears relaxed,
and in the foreground is a carton of cigarettes and a can of food.
   U.S. and Ecuadoran officials would not comment on negotiations
between the kidnappers and family representatives.
   In Illinois, his father, Roy Heimdal, said Thursday night the
family had received 10 photographs of his son recently, and he
speculated that the photo released in Ecuador could have been from
the same roll of film.
   He said about $35,000 of the $60,000 ransom had been raised after
the family made a televised plea for help to obtain the money.
   His wife, Marge Heimdal, said the kidnappers, reportedly members
of the pro-Cuban Popular Liberation Army guerrillas, have threatened
to ``show us where his body is'' unless they are paid before their
Monday deadline.
   The family said the money will be given to an unidentified
intermediary, who will carry the money into the jungles along the
Ecuador-Colombia border where their son was kidnapped.
   ``This has been like a nightmare,'' Mrs. Heimdal said in her
home. ``It's not easy to strip your soul in front of the whole
country. We're trying to keep our dignity. But we had no other way
to save our son than to go public like this.''
   A U.S. diplomatic source said Heimdal was in Colombian territory.
``We assume that his life is in danger,'' the source said on
condition of anonymity.
   A senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said: ``We must to be very careful. We are talking about a very
difficult case.
   ``Remember that Mr. Heimdal was abducted in Ecuador, near the
Ecuadoran-Colombian border, but he was immediately taken into
Colombian territory by his captors,'' the official added.
   Heimdal and four others were traveling by motorboat on the
Bermeja River, about six miles from the border, when they were
ambushed by armed guerrillas. The guerrillas killed the pilot,
injured another in the party and kidnapped Heimdal.
   Heimdal has worked the past two years at a dredging operation for
Iminco Co., a gold-mining company near the border.

   An oil tanker ran aground Thursday, spilling
260,000 gallons of heating oil into a busy shipping channel between
New Jersey and New York, and the first mate was arrested for
substance abuse.
   It was the fifth major oil spill in the area since January.
   Football-size globs of oil washed ashore on both sides of the
Kill Van Kull waterway, which was closed to ships after the tanker
BT Nautilus hit bottom while docking Thursday morning. Bathing
beaches on New Jersey's Atlantic shore weren't expected to be
affected, officials said.
   The first mate, identified in court documents as Gregory
Frederick Geoffrey, 52, of Merkse, England, pleaded innocent
Thursday night to charges of operating a vessel under the influence
of alcohol or drugs and negligent discharge of a pollutant without a
permit.
   His attorney, Richard F. X. Regan, said after the evening
arraignment, ``It appears that my client is really a scapegoat, at
this point in time, for what appears to be an accident.''
   Christopher Florentz, a spokesman for Attorney General Robert J.
Del Tufo, said he didn't know if Geoffrey was accused of using
alcohol or drugs. Officials didn't immediately disclose what role
Geoffrey had in guiding the tanker.
   Bayonne Municipal Court Judge Frank T. Carpenter III set bail at
$50,000 and ordered the ship to surrender Geoffrey's passport.
   Drug tests were ordered for other ship workers and the harbor
pilot who was on board to help steer the ship to dock.
   Oil leaked for almost five hours from the ship, which was
carrying 12 million gallons of heating fuel, said Coast Guard Rear
Adm. Richard Rybacki in Boston.
   Divers found a gash about 30 feet long and 12 to 16 inches wide
in one of the ship's tanks, Rybacki said. The tank holds 1.2 million
gallons.
   New York Lt. Gov. Stan Lundine, after a helicopter tour of the
area with New York Environmental Conservation Commissioner Thomas
Jorling, called the spill serious.
   ``There are areas on beaches and in coves which are clearly
contaminated with this very heavy oil,'' he said.
   The recent rash of spills in Kill Van Kull and connecting Arthur
Kill have brought harsh criticism of the oil industry from
environmentalists and state officials. The waterways separate New
Jersey from New York's Staten Island, and lie along a heavily
industrialized area.
   New York Attorney General Robert Abrams said his office was
conducting civil and criminal investigations into the spill.
   Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Gene Hoff said booms were strung
around the ship to contain the floating oil. Vacuum and skimming
equipment were being used to clean up the slick, and up to 300
workers were expected to use rakes, shovels and absorbent material
to clean the shoreline.
   ``It looks like mud, really disgusting,'' said Margaret Capuana
of Jersey City, who went to a park at the southern tip of Bayonne to
see the crippled tanker.
   The tanker is owned by Nautilus Motor Tanker of Gibraltar, and
operated by Bulk Tanker Management of London. The vessel is
registered in Hong Kong.
   Richard Bartha, a Rutgers University microbiology professor, said
the waterways have suffered such environmental destruction in recent
months that only birds were likely to suffer serious harm.
   ``There is little living in the water anymore, because the water
quality is so bad,'' he said.
   Thursday's spill prompted New York and New Jersey members of
Congress to ask that House Speaker Thomas Foley add a proposal to
require double hulls on oil tankers into an oil spill bill being
considered by a House-Senate committee.
   The waterways have been plagued with major oil spills this year.
   On Jan. 1-2, 567,000 gallons of oil leaked into the Arthur Kill
from a ruptured Exxon underwater pipeline.
   On Feb. 28, 30,000 gallons of heating oil spilled into the Kill
Van Kull from a barge anchored in Bayonne. A day later, nearly 4,000
gallons of heavy crude oil spilled into the Arthur Kill at Exxon's
refinery in Linden.
   About a week later, more than 100,000 gallons of heating oil was
dumped in the Arthur Kill near Linden from a barge that exploded and
caught fire.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials, newspapers and businessmen on
Thursday protested a U.S. decision to keep Colombia out of an
international trade agreement.
   The decision by Washington came one day after President Bush
promised to help the country fight its drug war.
   The United States on Wednesday decided not to give Colombia
preferential treatment under the Subsidies Code of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT. Colombia sends 40 percent of
its exports to the United States.
   Angry Colombians called the decision hostile, since the United
States had said it would help the country defeat its violent drug
traffickers.
   On Tuesday, Bush met with President Virgilio Barco in Washington
and reiterated the U.S. pledge to aid Colombia economically.
   The President of the National Association of Exporters, Ricardo
Sala Gaitan, on Thursday called the U.S. rejection a ``a slap in the
face.''
   ``There is a contradiction that can only be called spectacular
between the smiles of President Bush in the photographs with
President Barco and the attitude of his own government,'' he said in
an interview with the RCN radio network.
   The Subsidies Code would require U.S. companies to prove they had
been damaged by Colombian exports before any trade sanctions could
be applied.
   Under the current arrangement, if U.S. companies claim injury,
the burden rests on Colombia to prove otherwise.
   A U.S. embassy spokesman told The Associated Press that U.S.
policy is not to admit countries into the Subsidies Code unless
there exists a bilateral agreement governing subsidies.
   ``Every new country has to have a bilateral agreement with us in
which they agree to phase out their own export subsidies,'' the
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Colombian Development Minister Maria Mercedes de Martinez said in
a news conference that 30 countries approved Colombia's request in
Geneva to join the Subsidies Code, but that the United States
rejected it.
   Martinez was quoted in the Bogota daily El Espectador as saying,
``the decision cannot be justified when our country is going through
serious difficulties which the rest of the world is well aware of.''
   El Espectador itself condemned the decision.
   ``The North American attitude is a real slight by President Bush,
who says he supports Colombia's war against the drug cartels, but
makes no effort to demonstrate the sincerity of his words,'' it said.
   Colombian drug lords have been blamed for killing about 300
people since August, when Barco began a U.S.-backed anti-drug
crackdown.
   Colombia has complained that the United States discriminates
against its legal exports such as coffee and flowers, without
providing enough support to erradicate drugs.
   During a February anti-drug summit in Cartagena, Colombia, Bush
promised the leaders of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru to help reduce
their peoples' dependence on the lucrative cocaine trade. Bush
agreed this could only happen through building stronger economies.

   Leaders of the Warsaw Pact on Thursday began
transforming their 35-year-old alliance from a military to a
political body, declaring the ``enemy image'' of East and West to be
a thing of the past.
   Members of the Kremlin-led alliance also discussed various roles
for a united Germany in Europe, said Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli
Kvitsinsky, but he indicated there was no agreement.
   The leaders also declared their ``readiness for constructive
cooperation'' with archrival NATO.
   They said they favor the formation of a new, ``all-European
security system and the creation of a single Europe of peace and
cooperation,'' without artificial barriers and ``ideological
hostility.''
   To do this, it has become necessary ``to reconsider the character
and functions of the Warsaw Treaty,'' its members said in a
declaration adopted at the meeting. New proposals on such a
transformation will be drawn up before the end of October.
   ``The prevailing view was that we have to emphasize the political
component in the Warsaw Treaty Organization activities,'' Kvitsinsky
said at a news conference.
   Soviet and East European sources familiar with the thinking of
government leaders have said that the envisioned new political
structure of the Warsaw Pact would be patterned roughly after the
NATO secretariat and council in Brussels, although no firm plans
have been disclosed.
   ``We have to broaden the consultative basis of the Warsaw Treaty
Organization activities, and perhaps we should go in the direction
of curtailing the military structures,'' Kvitsinsky said.
   Warsaw Pact members include Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East
Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia
and Albania are no longer members of the pact, which has been
criticized by some of its members as outdated, given the
pro-democratic reforms in Eastern Europe since 1989.
   Romanian President Ion Iliescu said the view was unanimous at the
meeting to move away from military aspects and focus on the
political nature of the organization, founded 35 years ago.
   ``All the participants spoke in favor of developing and adapting
the Treaty on the line of the processes under way in Europe now, so
that the development of the political character of the Treaty could
be emphasized,'' Iliescu told Soviet television.
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel, arriving in Prague, said the
meeting was ``probably the most important in the history of this
body'' because it paved the way for the Warsaw Pact to proceed with
the transformation of the security order in Europe.
   Havel said Czechoslovakia presented the draft of the new order
for the Warsaw Pact to its members last week and deputy foreign
ministers from the nations worked on it through the night Wednesday
and Thursday.
   ``Participants in the meeting are unanimous in their opinion that
the ideological enemy image has been overcome by mutual efforts of
the East and the West, while the notions of East and West are again
acquiring their purely geographical meaning,'' the declaration said.
   ``Confrontation elements contained in documents of the Warsaw
Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, that were adopted
in the past, are no longer in line with the spirit of the times,''
it said.
   A provisional commission of government representatives of the
member nations will work out proposals on transforming the alliance
before the end of October, and the Political Consultative Committee
_ the group that met in Moscow on Thursday _ will examine them
before the end of November, the declaration said.
   Havel said he proposed that the committee's plans on a new
security order in Europe be put before a 35-nation summit in Paris
in December. The Conference on European Security and Cooperation is
the successor to the one that issued the 1975 Helsinki Final Act.
   It also called for the ``full implementation of the basic human
rights and freedoms.''
   Despite statements before the meeting by Hungarian Prime Minister
Joszsef Antall that he wants to remove his country from the
alliance, Kvitsinsky said ``there wasn't a single statement made
relating to a wish to quit the Warsaw Treaty Organization.''
   Havel, too, said he stressed that Czechoslovakia remain in the
pact in order to oversee its transformation.
   Kvitsinsky said that all participants said the Warsaw Pact ``has
to be adapted to new circumstances.''
   He added that the topic of reorganizing the Warsaw Pact's
integrated military command also was brought up. The complex
structure places Soviet commanders over member armies in the event
of war.
   The Warsaw Pact members also heard a detailed report by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on his Washington summit last week
with President Bush.
   The possibility of a united Germany being a member of both
alliances was raised, Kvitsinsky said, along with other scenarios of
its political and military status.
   Havel and Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier also
indicated there was no agreement on future security arrangements for
a united Germany. The Soviets oppose NATO membership for a united
Germany, and Gorbachev and Bush failed to resolve their differences
over the issue last week.

   A former U.S. soldier convicted of
spying for the East bloc leaked documents on NATO and American
troops in Europe, the chief federal prosecutor's office said
Thursday.
   Former Army Sgt. 1st Class Clyde Lee Conrad was found guilty of
high treason and sentenced to life in prison in West Germany on
Wednesday after a court in Koblenz found he had passed classified
secrets to Hungary and Czechoslovakia for a decade.
   Late Thursday, the FBI announced that its agents had arrested
another former soldier on spying charges in an outgrowth of the
Conrad case.
   A court in the West German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, in
which the spying occurred, found the 43-year-old Conrad guilty of
providing classified material to the Hungarian and Czechoslovak
secret services from 1975 through 1985.
   It was the first time a foreign resident living in West Germany
had been tried for espionage.
   It estimated he received $1.2 million for his efforts.
   The native of Sebring, Ohio, had been in charge of the classified
document center at the army's 8th Infantry Division in Bad
Krueznach, 50 miles west of Frankfurt, during the majority of his
time with the unit.
   A top official in the chief federal prosecutor's office in
Karlsruhe, Alexander Prechtel, said Thursday that Conrad had turned
over ``defense strategic papers'' to the Hungarian and Czechoslovak
secret services.
   The documents concerned NATO and American troops in Germany and
Europe, Prechtel said, but he would not elaborate.
   Of the classified documents Conrad leaked, Prechtel said:
``Normally everything goes to the Soviet Union, but we can only
prove the way to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and the rest is
speculation.''
   Prechtel said authorities in Czechoslovakia and Hungary had not
cooperated in the investigation.
   ``But that's quite normal. Those countries who are involved in
the case, they are not asked to cooperate,'' he said.
   In Tampa, the FBI arrested another soldier in Conrad's unit,
Roderick James Ramsey, and accused him of violating espionage laws
against gathering or delivering defense information for a foreign
government.
   FBI Director William S. Sessions said the investigation was one
of the most complicated of its kind ever undertaken by the bureau,
and the information passed on was ``extremely sensitive.''
   In reporting Wednesday night that Ramsay had been targeted by the
FBI, ABC News said the espionage ring had smuggled computer parts
from the United States to the East Bloc through Canada.
   Prechtel denied that Conrad was involved in smuggling computer
parts.
   He said West Germans had no other investigation pending in
connection with the Conrad case but pointed out that the United
States had given West Germany the information for Conrad's
prosecution.
   Because Conrad had retired in West Germany with his German wife
and son, he had to be prosecuted by German authorities.
   U.S. authorities in West Germany referred all questions regarding
Conrad and possible other investigations to Washington.
   Conrad's Bonn-based lawyer, Klaus Huemmerich, said he would
appeal the judgment.
   Chief Judge Ferdinand Schuth said Conrad ``endangered the entire
defense capability of the West'' and that the former sergeant was
motivated by ``pure greed.''
   Had war broken out, the judge said, the information passed by
Conrad ``could have led to a breakdown in the defenses of the
Western Alliance,'' and ``to capitulation and the use of nuclear
weapons on German territory.''
   Schuth sentenced Conrad to life imprisonment for spying for the
Hungarians. He said Conrad was also guilty of spying for
Czechoslovakia on a lesser scale, and he sentenced him to four years
in prison on that charge.
   Conrad was arrested Aug. 23, 1988, on suspicion of heading a West
German-based international spy ring with Eastern contacts in Sweden
and Vienna, Austria.
   Conrad, who retired after 20 years in the military, served with
the Army from 1965 to September 1985 and had lived in West Germany
since his discharge.
   According to court records, Conrad was introduced to the
Hungarian secret service in late autumn 1975 by his supervisor in
the 8th Infantry Division, former U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Zoltan
Szabo.
   Szabo, who was convicted of espionage in Austria in 1989,
received a 10-month suspended sentence. He identified for
investigators some of the documents the court said Conrad sold to
the Hungarians.
   Two Hungarians, Sandor Kercsik and his brother, Imre, were
described by the court as Conrad's main contacts.
   The two were arrested in 1988 in Sweden and admitted being agents
of the Hungarian secret police. They were sentenced to 18 months in
prison for possessing NATO defense material.
   The Kercsik brothers also provided statements to the Rhineland
Palatinate state court with evidence implicating Conrad.

   Universal Studios Florida held a glitzy
Hollywood-style inaugural Thursday in a $630 million gamble that it
can compete with entertainment giant Walt Disney World on its own
turf.
   The combination film production center and tourist park also is
an important test of whether its parent company, MCA Inc., and
partner Rank Organization PLC of London can export the same concept
to Europe and Japan _ again following in Disney's footsteps.
   ``We think there's a terrific market out there'' for high-tech
theme parks, said MCA Vice President Jay Stein. ``The foreign
prospects are excellent.''
   Success here would set the pace for a breakout from MCA's basic
business of filmmaking into tourist parks, in this country and
overseas.
   Universal Studio Tour in Los Angeles opened in 1964. But the
444-acre Florida complex is a bigger, more sophisticated version,
considered a prototype for the future by company officials.
   Besides the formidable competition posed by Walt Disney World's
three attractions just a few miles down the road from Universal,
Disney's also got the jump on foreign shores.
   Euro Disneyland is scheduled to open outside Paris in 1992 and
Tokyo Disneyland has been in operation since 1983. MCA has announced
plans for a theme park in Japan, in partnership with Nippon Steel.
   Stein, who headed the creative team that built the Florida park,
said an announcement of a site for MCA-Rank's European enterprise
could come within a month. Locations near Paris and London are under
consideration, MCA officials say.
   But much depends on whether Universal can get a healthy portion
of the 13 million annual visitors to Central Florida.
   With a daily capacity of 40,000 to 50,000, MCA expects to host
from 5 million to 6 million people its first year.
   Richard P. Simon, an entertainment analyst for Goldman Sachs in
New York, said MCA probably needs only about 3{ million visitors a
year to break even.
   ``I think they'll be profitable in the first full year,'' he
said. ``Initially the market will not be large enough to accomodate
the large jump in capacity. But I think in time it will be.''
   The Disney-MGM Studios, which celebrated its first anniversary
May 1, racked up 8 million ``visits'' in its first year. Disney
records turnstile counts, meaning some guests can be counted more
than once during a visit.
   Disney has been luring tourists to Central Florida for almost two
decades and is one of the industry's top merchandising experts. The
Magic Kingdom opened in 1971 and Epcot Center began operating in
1982.
   The two companies have been caught up in a promotional frenzy in
recent weeks, spending money lavishly on radio, television and
newspaper advertising as well in the travel-trade press.
   Universal Studios President Steven Lew said Wednesday that
MCA-Rank and its partners in the Orlando attraction will spend a
total of $150 million this year in advertising and merchandising the
$630 million park.
   Entertainment analysts say Disney is spending at least $50
million to market all three of the Florida parks this fiscal year.

<HEAD>`Prin' Opens Starring Eileen Atkins</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs Planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wonderful actress named Eileen Atkins is
playing the title role in ``Prin,'' which is more an interesting
character study than a play.
   ``Prin,'' by Andrew Davies, opened at off-Broadway's Manhattan
Theater Club on Wednesday. Davies' ``Rose'' starred Glenda Jackson
on Broadway nearly a decade ago and also was about a teacher.
   ``Prin'' upgrades its title character to principal of an English
teacher-training college specializing in science, dance and physical
education.
   It is to Davies' credit that he maintains suspense in the midst
of several different situations.
   The play starts slowly, in the principal's office, with Prin
urging vice principal Dorothy Dibs, played with wan charm by Amy
Wright, to mimicry and flights of fancy. It's clear, though they
don't say so untill later, that they're lovers. Prin had chosen the
younger woman from a dance class.
   Dorothy would still like to be called Dorothy, but Prin, who
plows through life ignoring other people's desires _ even those of
someone she loves _ calls Dorothy ``Little Dibs.''
   It's clear that Dorothy isn't a committed lesbian and probably is
about to leave Prin for a man.
   It's also clear that the college will go under, merging with
either a university or a technical school. Prin might have a
formidable personality that could intimidate a board of directors
but she doesn't rely on that. It's inconceivable to Prin that the
college will fold. Living largely in her imagination and without a
single ace in her hand, she simply believes that she'll win through.
   Early in Act 1, Prin speaks to graduates. ``You are, all of you,
excellent.'' She tells them that teachers can show children how to
be extraordinary and change the world. It's clear she has devoted
her life to that belief.
   Less admirably, Prin is elitist, really interested only in people
with superior minds, the ``prima donnas'' as opposed to the ``job
lots.''
   Prin's life does crash and crumble, and Atkins brilliantly puts
her heartbreak in her face.
   But Prin's blunt approach to life and her beliefs sustain her.
Out of a job, she is seen at the end lecturing to a group whose name
she doesn't know. ``You look a pretty rum bunch,'' she tells them.
Then, as fervently as she had with the college graduates, she
lectures them about the holiness of the heart's affections, the
truth of the imagination and the pursuit of the extraordinary.
   John Curless and John Christopher Jones were good as teachers.
Wendy Makkena squirmed nicely as a promiscuous student with low
self-esteem. Remak Ramsay played the merger sponsor. He seemed
uncomfortable telling Prin he'd always hated her, possibly one too
many emotions from the author.
   John Lee Beatty designed the set. John Tillinger directed.

   Lawmakers are threatening to block exports of
U.S. high technology to the Soviet Union until it ends its economic
blockade of Lithuania.
   By a 390-24 vote Thursday, the House voted to bar the sale of
U.S. computers and telecommunications gear needed to modernize the
Soviet economy until Moscow begins negotiating Lithuania's
independence ``without economic coercion.''
   On a voice vote, the House also agreed to ban high-tech sales to
the Soviet Union if it continues to restrict Jewish emigration.
   ``While the Soviet president put out one hand in requesting aid
from the United States, the other hand is wrapped tightly around the
neck of Lithuania,'' said Rep. William Broomfield of Michigan, the
senior Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

   Pro-choice Republicans won a trio of platform
victories at recent state party conventions and expect still more
states to part ways with the national GOP's anti-abortion plank this
year.
   Republicans in Maine and New York have adopted pro-choice state
platform provisions, and Wisconsin Republicans voted down an
anti-abortion plank that would have called for legal protection
``for all human beings, from conception on.''
   With the convention season just beginning, more state parties
will be taking up platform language or resolutions in coming weeks
that depart from the national GOP's platform opposition to abortion.
   The actions have the indirect blessing of national Republicans,
as they test Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater's assertion
that the party is a ``big tent'' with room for differing views on
abortion.

   State medical regulators have joined prosecutors
in investigating Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the suicide-machine inventor
treading the line separating outsider from outlaw.
   The Department of Licensing and Regulation launched a probe
Wednesday of the 62-year-old retired pathologist who hooked an
Alzheimer's victim to the drug-injecting apparatus and let her take
her life with the press of a button.
   ``Our role is to gather the facts and evidence and determine what
occurred,'' said Mary MacDowell, director of the department's Health
Investigation Division.
   Evidence of a violation of regulations would be referred to the
state Board of Medicine, which could reprimand Kevorkian or lift his
license, MacDowell said.

   Tens of thousands of immigrants paid millions of
dollars to Panamanian officials led by Manuel Noriega to use that
nation as an illegal gateway to the United States and Canada, U.S.
immigration officials allege.
   ``They ran the most sophisticated organization we have ever seen.
Nobody ever operated an alien-smuggling operation to the extent of
Panama,'' said Robert Harris, chief criminal investigator for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service in Miami.
   INS officials have enough evidence against Noriega to indict him,
but they and federal prosecutors don't want to interfere with the
drug trafficking case against him, Harris said.
   The office of U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen acknowledged it is
investigating the alien-smuggling allegations. But in a statement
Wednesday, Lehtinen denied any indictment is now contemplated
against the former dictator.

   From 3.8 billion miles, the Earth is a blue dot
in an ocean of black.
   ``On that blue dot, that's where everyone you know, everyone you
ever heard of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their
life,'' astronomer Carl Sagan said Wednesday as NASA released an
extraordinary photo taken from a vantage point in deep space.
   Voyager 1, speeding toward the edge of the solar system, looked
back in February and snapped photos of six of the nine planets that
whirl around the sun.
   The photograph, actually a mosaic of 64 images taken in a
four-hour period, was the last from the spacecraft. The pictures
were recorded Feb. 13-14 but were not played back to Earth until
late March because deep-space radio receivers were occupied with
higher priority tasks.

<HEAD>Beirut's Criminal Justice System Has a Backlog</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Because of the shelling, judges seldom
hold people in jail awaiting trial, but artillery fire also keeps
judges and lawyers away from work, so an accused can wait a long
time for his day in court.
   Murder, burglary and other crimes still are against the law after
15 years of ruinous civil war, but the battle often overruns what
remains of the criminal justice system.
   Months of fighting trapped about 420 prisoners being held on
charges of murder, theft and drug trafficking. The showdown between
Christian factions led by Gen. Michel Aoun and Samir Geagea has
taken nearly 1,000 lives and wounded more than 2,500 people since
Jan. 30.
   A lawyer who fled to Moslem west Beirut said judicial authorities
were unable to meet to consider dozens of cases of people awaiting
prosecution for common crimes.
   ``They were arrested and jailed, and now their fate depends on
the situation,'' said the lawyer.
   The Palace of Justice, where the meetings normally are held, is
on the confrontation line between Geagea's areas of influence and
Aoun's terrain. It is subject to constant sniper fire and shelling.
   ``We have been trying to form a committee, to meet anywhere, in
order to take a decision to release the prisoners on bail pending a
trial when security conditions permit,'' said the judge, who
demanded anonymity like the others interviewed.
   ``I switched on the TV one night and saw gunmen sniping from my
office at the Palace of Justice. We obviously cannot meet there.''
   According to the lawyer, some colleagues paid quick visits to the
Palace of Justice to hide or remove files, ``but it is not possible
to operate normally from there.''
   The jails are in the most heavily shelled areas of Roumieh,
Baabda and Furn el-Shubbak, all held by Aoun, the judge said.
   Roumieh prison is the biggest. Aoun's main howitzer batteries are
deployed in a wooded valley around it, partially protected from
Geagea's fire.
   ``The prisons are so crowded and in such dangerous areas that,
whenever we can meet, we try to release most of the detainees who
have committed minor offenses on bail set at a minimal amount,'' the
judge said.
   ``We also have no wards to treat drug addicts, so again we tend
to set them free on bail because if we place them in prison, they'll
be more corrupted by other prisoners.''
   Few jails have bomb shelters and the guards generally flee when
shelling starts.
   About fifty inmates escaped from a prison in Moslem west Beirut
last year when artillery fire knocked down cell walls during Aoun's
six-month battle with Syrian soldiers and their Moslem allies. Only
about 30 were caught.
   The Christian feud has stopped family visits to prisoners, and
telephones went dead months ago.
   ``The lack of security also means prisoners could receive
visitors only during lulls in the fighting,'' the judge said.
``Those who have family and friends in Geagea-controlled areas
haven't had visitors since the clashes began.''
   The judge said some prisoners who finished their terms might be
safer in jail, but were not allowed to stay.
   ``If they are known to have been Geagea supporters before they
were imprisoned, they're in trouble, for the prisons are in an area
under Aoun's control,'' he said.

   Open the wallet of Louis B. Jones and you'll find
a California driver's license, a slip of yellow paper, scribbled
messages and a counterfeit $20 bill.
   The bill is printed on typing paper, stained by tea. It's dated
1985 and has the signature of then Secretary of the Treasury James
A. Baker III on the lower right-hand side. You can tell it's fake by
scratching it against a hard surface and watching the ink run off.
Also, the green is much paler than real currency.
   No, Jones is not a crook, and he's not playing a board game.
Jones is a writer. The fake bill was part of research for his first
novel, ``Ordinary Money'' ($18.95, Viking), in which the author
imagines the serious conseqences of a little funny money.
   ``A catalyst was Andre Gide's novel, `The Counterfeiters,''' said
the author, a native of Chicago who now lives in Mill Valley, Calif.
   ``It's about a bunch of children, one of whom runs away from
home. Gide seems to think money is the devil. It's about modern,
sensible people who don't think the devil exists even though it
passes through his fingers every day.''
   ``Ordinary Money'' is a morality play complete with fake limbs,
real love, near adultery and ever present federal agents. The real,
the unreal and the surreal mix like coins in a piggy bank.
   Wayne Paschke is trying to be sensible, but it's not easy. He
knows about bills, real bills, the kind that arrive at the first of
the month. A resident of California's Marin County, Wayne's has a
wife, a teen-age daughter, another kid on the way and a
less-than-promising career painting houses. He's willing to take
some chances to make money, even try something a little silly, like
selling coins over the telephone.
   In this practical man's garage sits a wooden crate crammed with
$20 bills, printed on paper so authentic that even the Feds think
it's real. It's a gift from his best friend Randy Potts, ``a
government unto himself'' looking to get rich with the speed of his
ill-gotten red Ferrari.
   The author makes a cameo appearance. Randy has received the money
from his boss, a mysterious man who meets with him in parking lots
of fast-food restaurants and offers instructions on how to pass the
bucks.
   Jones named the boss ``Auctor.''
   ```The Latin name for author is auctor,'' Jones explained. ``The
fact that we're both in the business of inventing images was very
much on my mind. When I go in a bookstore and see my book next to
Thomas Pynchon's, I feel like a counterfeiter.''
   Like Wayne, Jones has stumbled a few times himself, writing
several unpublished novels, heading for New York to become an author
and leaving ``scared, defeated, brokenhearted about my
possibilities.''
   In ``Ordinary Money,'' Jones writes:
   ``The old Wayne Paschke would have found Marketrend ridiculous.
But exactly when things seemed most absurd, that was the moment when
the successful man plunges forward without admitting the possibility
of defeat, almost irrationally.''
   Jones admits he's also taken some awkward plunges.
   ``When I was 17 or 18, I got involved with something called
`Bestline,' which is something like Amway. Bestline is soap. You
studied this book about self-esteem, and go to these meeting and
stir a lot of enthusiasm.
   ``What you're competing for is the Cadillac, a bonus Cadillac. If
you get enough points you get a pink Cadillac. I really kind of
believed it for two months, like Wayne. It was a happy mistake. I
learned by becoming someone else, living with different values. It
was a kind of schizophrenic experience.''
   Research for ``Ordinary Money'' began in 1985 when Jones set up
various bleaches on his kitchen counter, printed specimens on typing
paper and trimmed them with a paper cutter.
   Two years later, he took another plunge. Jones headed for the
Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington, enduring the
occasional eviction by angry security guards as he sought official
advice on how to break the bank.
   On paper, at least, Jones succeeds, writing of computer-driven
lasers, argon lasers and flying spot scanners, making the process of
counterfeiting seem as simple as selling detergent.
   In real life, however, the author reports that he can do no
better than invent the perfect crime.
   ``It's unhappy. I hate to be the man who says there's no Mary
Poppins,'' said Jones, holding a real bill in his hands. ``But the
perfect counterfeit bill is not yet a technological possibility. It
almost is.''

<HEAD>Twisting The FHA Insurance Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One reason why the government's mortgage
insurance program could go broke is that in some respects it has
been skewed to reward those who don't need it and deny those who do.
   It is just one of many defects in the nation's public housing
program, many of which developed during the tenure of Samuel Pierce
Jr., the former secretary of housing and urban development.
   It is also another chapter in a big book, of how another
well-intended government program, one that theoretically could make
home-ownership more possible for the poor, becomes twisted in the
practical application.
   That twist has helped produce some incredible losses in the
single-family home-mortgage program. The Federal Housing
Administration's single-family mortgage programs, for example, lost
more than $1 billion in 1988.
   Critics, to be found everywhere _ in Congress, in the FHA itself,
among lenders and among neighborhood action groups _ fear that by
the end of the decade the government insurance program could become
another S&amp;L debacle.
   That financial disaster, for those who need reminding, could cost
American taxpayers as much as a half-trillion dollars, and some
blame for it can be attributed to poor government supervision and
regulation.
   The FHA mortgage insurance program, like government guarantees on
deposits in now insolvent savings and loan associations, is also
victimized by some lax regulation, bad loans and favoritism toward
certain borrowers.
   Designed with middle-income and low-income homebuyers in mind, it
has in some instances become a financing tool for yuppies who, it
often turns out, may be poorer risks than the poor. That, at least,
is what the figures show.
   ``Providing 100 percent insurance on loans to yuppies in
speculative housing markets is a sure-fire recipe for a new federal
bailout, this time of the FHA,'' says Gale Cincotta, chairman of
National People's Action.
   To Cincotta, an authority on community reinvestment and housing _
she was appointed by HUD Secretary Jack Kemp to a commission on
affordable housing _ this is but one of many distortions of the
Federal Housing Administration program, but a very significant one.
   Why should 100 percent government-insured loans be going to
yuppies with good incomes, and who have the option of obtaining a
variety of other loans, rather than to the more needy, who have
little or no other choice?
   That, however, is the situation, and that situation has still
another dimension: The bigger loans, such as those that Cincotta
says go to the yuppies, often have the highest foreclosure rate.
   She refers to studies, one by the Mortgage Insurance Companies of
American in 1989 and another just completed by the United Guaranty
Residential Insurance Corp., that demonstrate this correlation on
privately insured mortgages.
   She maintains that much the same pattern applies to FHA loans,
that is, the larger they are the stronger becomes the correlation
with foreclosure. And the reverse: The smaller the loan, the smaller
the foreclosure ratio.
   But why should FHA-insured loans go to the more rather than less
affluent? Because, she says, while the federal government might lose
on them, the lenders and brokers who originate the loans find them
more profitable.
   Many mortgage companies imposed minimum loan amounts on FHA
loans, even in violation of the law. They do it simply by refusing
to make loans under $25,000 and by adding on points to loans under a
certain amount, such as $40,000.
   NPA demonstrated this by calling the top five Veterans
Administration and FHA mortgage lenders in Chicago, Philadelphia,
Cleveland and Milwaukee. All employed minimum loan amounts or points
for the smallest loans.
   The reason why is understandable if not defendable: Every
origination fee a mortgage banker receives is a percentage of the
size of the loan. The larger the loan, the bigger the fee.
   The FHA sought to encourage smaller loans, such as those to
poorer people most in need of FHA help, by raising the annual
servicing fee on the smaller loans, but it apparently wasn't enough
to turn the tide.
   ``It's outrageous that federal programs like FHA are being used
to discriminate against and rip off lower income and minority home
buyers,'' says Cincotta.
   Cincotta's Chicago-based organization is a foundation-supported
coalition of more than 200 housing groups. It is allied with the
National Training and Information Center, which develops and teaches
ways to preserve neighborhoods.

<HEAD>Cold War Thaw Topic of `Other Summit'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, back at the other summit, the thawed
Cold War is a factor, too. Budget negotiators have their sights on
military spending, and want to know how much more it can be cut
because of what the diplomats have done.
   The link between the budget summit and the superpower summit _
said to have marked the end of the Cold War era _ is not as clear
and direct as Democratic leaders want to make it, so as to press the
case for sharp Pentagon spending cuts.
   At the budget talks Bush convened with a White House sendoff a
month ago, there's no sign of a breakthrough any time soon. Those
discussions have settled into a routine that may keep the
negotiators at it most of the summer.
   They haven't yet started bargaining on specific steps to save or
raise funds in order to reach the legal limit on this year's
deficit, and avoid an election-time slash in federal programs across
the board. Such automatic spending cuts have happened before, but
this time, the administration says the cuts would be so drastic that
voters would feel the impact _ and congressional election candidates
might, too.
   The deficit limit is $64 billion. The budget summit is seeking
agreement on steps to get close to that target, with deficit
estimates now ranging over $200 billion. So far, most of their time
has been spent on technical questions _ basically, on starting
points for negotiation. The negotiating teams for Congress and the
White House have agreed to meet daily from now on, instead of
convening twice a week.
   They have yet to determine how much money has to be saved and
raised in order to meet the legal limit and avoid punishing cuts
next fall.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the Joint Economic
Committee, has just issued a Democratic study contending that overly
optimistic administration forecasts mask the real size of deficits
over the next five years.
   ``If the budget agreement is not based on realistic and prudent
assumptions, the result will be an empty declaration of victory,''
Hamilton said.
   Any declaration of victory, hollow or otherwise, is a long way
away.
   This summit and the superpower summit reached something of a
common denominator when Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Brent
Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, talked with
the budget bargainers last week.
   That prompted the question of whether the diplomatic summit had
produced accords that would prompt defense spending moves at the
budget summit, but the White House wasn't answering. ``We aren't
willing to discuss any specifics of the budget negotiations,'' said
Marlin Fitzwater, the president's press secretary.
   Cheney wasn't bargaining on the administration's $303.3 billion
defense budget, which Democratic critics say is too high for a time
of easing international tensions. But he did agree to produce a
Pentagon study of what would happen to the defense budget should
military force levels be cut by 25 percent over the next five years.
   He said the Pentagon already is analyzing that option.
   That study doesn't mean the administration would sign off on such
cuts and again, as on the overall question of deficit projections,
the starting point for negotiation is not yet settled.
   Cheney and his Pentagon planners contend that ebbing Cold War
tensions and steadily reduced defense spending already are factored
in to their budget projections.
   ``The military budget has declined in real terms since 1985,''
Secretary of the Air Force Donald B. Rice told the Detroit Economic
Club last month. ``Based on the president's budget ... defense has
already been cut 12 to 13 percent in purchasing power.
   ``Our internal planning, under Secretary Cheney's guidance, will
bring the Department of Defense to a total real decline of 22
percent by 1997,'' he said.
   Defense outlays at that point would account for their lowest
share of federal spending since before Pearl Harbor, even without
the cuts Congress is certain to make.
   By Pentagon count, over the 10 years beginning in 1985, defense
budget reductions will total $515 billion.
   Rice said Pentagon planners began factoring a peace dividend into
their projections five years ago.
   Those arguments don't take with Democratic leaders and with some
Republicans in Congress; they think there's much more to be cut out
of military spending in the quest for a long-term budget and deficit
settlement.

<HEAD>In Barry Case, Say Some Blacks, `Selective Prosecution' Is at Play</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ever since Adam Clayton Powell, the flamboyant
playboy-preacher from Harlem, was driven from his House seat in
1967, black leaders have seen a conspiracy at work.
   For years they've said that the white power structure singles out
any black politician who threatens the status quo _ and some who
don't _ for relentless investigation and costly prosecution.
   Washington Mayor Marion Barry Jr., on trial on drug and perjury
charges after an elaborate FBI sting, they say, is just the latest
victim of ``selective prosecution.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh denies that government
prosecutors targeted Barry or that they go after black politicians.
   ``We follow the evidence wherever it leads, regardless of
position, race, party affiliation or other identifying factors,''
Thornburgh said in January. He was responding to Benjamin Hooks,
executive director of the NAACP, who pictured Barry as a victim of
selective law enforcement.
   Hooks remains unconvinced. In an interview, he estimated that 80
percent of the black people in Washington share the perception that
Barry has been singled out.
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens suggested that the government paid
extraordinary attention to the Barry case _ after years of rumors
that he was using drugs _ because, as mayor, Barry was a role model
for the black youth of Washington.
   In court, Stephens called Barry's arrest ``a personal tragedy for
the defendant'' but added: ``Narcotics abuse is also a tragedy for
this city. Narcotics abuse is not a victimless crime.''
   The issue of whether Barry had been singled out because of his
race came to dominate the jury selection process last week at his
trial.
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson asked prospective jurors if they
believe the law is selectively enforced. Many of the blacks said
they did.
   ``It seems like some people are made to go through a little more
than others,'' said one, a gospel singer. ``They televised this too
much, talked about it too much. ... I think race had a lot to do
with it, as far as giving him a hard time.''
   The judge asked if a white mayor would have been spared
prosecution under similar circumstances.
   ``Exactly,'' she said.
   ``The masses of the people out there understand what is going
on,'' says Clarence Mitchell III, former Maryland state legislator
and one-time colleague with Barry in the 1960s civil rights
organization, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
   ``The media can say Barry's lifestyle is not appropriate but the
masses of people perceive that if Marion Barry were white we would
not be reading anything about him,'' says Mitchell.
   Mitchell says he, too, became a victim of selective prosecution
as he was running in a primary for the nomination to a congressional
seat vacated by his uncle, Parren Mitchell.
   Mitchell lost the nomination. He and his brother, Michael _
scions of a prominent black family and son of civil rights leader
Clarence Mitchell Jr. _ were subsequently convicted of taking a
bribe to block an investigation by Parren Mitchell's House Small
Business Committee.
   At the sentencing, their mother, Juanita Jackson Mitchell,
alluded to their claim that they were victims of an FBI vendetta
against black leaders.
   ``My sons are casualties on the road to freedom,'' she said.
   Thus, say black leaders, the Mitchells joined a long list of
black politicians who had been singled out.
   On the list: Mayors Maynard Jackson of Atlanta, Coleman Young of
Detroit, and Richard Arrington of Birmingham, Ala.; former Mayors
Carl Stokes of Cleveland, Kenneth Gibson of Newark, N.J., and
Charles Evers of Fayette, Miss.; Reps. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.,
Harold Ford, D-Tenn., and Louis Stokes, D-Ohio; and former Reps.
Shirley Chisholm, D-N.Y. and Charles Diggs, D-Mich.
   Hooks says, ``If they had accused Barry of stealing millions,
creating a slush fund, awarding corrupt contracts, that would be one
thing. But a personal habit that is bad, dangerous, lethal, that
makes him a bad role model? There are 4 million people out there
doing it. If there are 4 million, why did they pick out one and
stick on his case for eight years?''
   Hooks is careful to say he is not passing judgment on Barry's
guilt or innocence. Instead, he draws an analogy: ``If everyone is
going 80 miles an hour on the highway, and you're doing 70 and the
cops stop you, you've got to wonder.''
   ``What I'm trying to say is the perception is there,'' he says,
``and the government has a right to dispel the perception if it
isn't true.''
   Adds Joann Watson, who heads the National YWCA's Office of Racial
Justice: ``We are not supporting _ quote _ `corrupt' politicians.''
   Joseph Agne, consultant to the National Council of Churches, says
he sees a motive behind selective prosecution: ``This is one way to
get around the gains from the Voting Rights Act,'' whose enactment
raised the number of black elected officials from the scores to the
thousands.
   But lawyer Richard A. Samp, chief counsel for the conservative
Washington Legal Foundation, says prosecutors lack the resources to
bring charges against every lawbreaker. He says it makes sense for
them to focus first on officeholders.
   Blacks aren't singled out, he says, but since there is likely to
be more corruption at the local level, and ``given that much of the
black electoral success to date has been at the local level, it is
perhaps not surprising that blacks have been included among the
targets of these corruption probes.''
   And Louis Michael Seidman, law professor at Georgetown
University, points to a 19th century Supreme Court decision that
selective prosecution _ of prominent wealthy people on tax charges,
for example _ is permissible, as long as it is not based on such
things as race or religion.
   Now that Barry has admitted he used crack cocaine at the Vista
Hotel on Jan. 18, his only recourse is to persuade a jury that he
was unfairly singled out, says Seidman.
   ``In reality, that is his defense,'' says Seidman.
   Barry seemed to be saying as much when he told The Washington
Post on May 28, ``I think the prosecutors know that in this town all
it takes is one juror saying: `I'm not going to convict Marion
Barry, I don't care what you say.'''
   Mary R. Sawyer, assistant professor of religious studies at Iowa
State University in Ames, has been studying the question of
selective prosecution for years.
   ``What is happening to black elected officials today is only
marginally different from what happened to black activists in the
black power and black civil right eras and to what happened to
blacks during Jim Crow segregation days and what happened to blacks
during slavery,'' Ms. Sawyer said.
   ``In each instance, the leaders were singled out, there was a
double standard, there were steps taken to intimidate and terminate
effective strategies for social change.''

<HEAD>Plan To Escalate Drug War Provokes Debate in Bolivia</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhotos</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plans to involve the army in fighting
drugs, which the United States supports, have many Bolivians worried
that a largely peaceful law-enforcement effort will become a bloody
war like the one in Colombia.
   Proponents say only the military can control the vast, lawless
areas where cocaine traffickers now operate with impunity.
   Few shots have been fired in Bolivia's campaign against
narcotics, and bloodshed is rare.
   A specially trained 600-man police unit, called the Leopards,
works closely with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in
pursuing processors and traffickers. Growers of coca, the base of
cocaine, are urged to switch crops voluntarily.
   During a trip to Washington in May, however, President Jaime Paz
Zamora agreed to commit about 900 soldiers in two army battalions to
the effort, and to increase air force and navy involvement.
   In return, Bolivia will get $75 million worth of U.S. military
equipment and training during 1990-91.
   Paz Zamora kept the agreement quiet, preferring to emphasize $127
million in economic aid pledged by the United States in the same
two-year period, but it was leaked to the La Paz newspaper
Presencia. Publication inspired protests from opposition politicians
and labor unions.
   Presencia quoted Jorge Alderrete, a former undersecretary of the
interior, as saying: ``The government has put at risk all the
country's chances to achieve a peaceful solution to the drug
trafficking problem. It will do nothing more than prove an old
axiom: Violence begets violence.''
   Alderrete is a prominent member of the Revolutionary Nationalist
Movement, the main political opposition.
   Bolivia's army is better known for coups d'etat and corruption
than combat skills. A military government that took power in 1980
even worked closely with cocaine traffickers.
   The army also has a reputation for heavy-handedness. When it is
called in to put down strikes, for instance, bloodshed often results.
   Coca-growing peasants, militant and well organized, have sworn
they will resist any any military crackdown.
   Leading officers of the Leopards also question the switch to a
military approach.
   Maj. Carlos Barriga, Leopard commander for the Beni region, said
he would accept whatever help he could get, but that army
involvement ``can create big social problems. ... We've had some
experiences in the past.''
   ``The armed forces is an institution created to defend
sovereignty from an exterior threat,'' Barriga said in an interview
in Trinidad, capital of the Beni. ``I think the situation is being
basically controlled now, without violence.''
   The Beni is an expanse of jungles and grasslands about the size
of Texas, loaded with clandestine cocaine laboratories.
   Barriga said Leopard and DEA operations there had ``done a lot of
damage'' to the traffickers. He cited the discovery of 18 labs and
10 important drug caches during 1989.
   Don Ferrarone, DEA attache for Bolivia, said the most pressing
need was additional transport and communications equipment so more
Leopards could take part in raids. He said only about two dozen
could be deployed for an operation by air because of shortages of
planes and helicopters.
   ``The first thing we need to attend to is fully applying the
people we have out here,'' he told The Associated Press in Trinidad,
where he was directing helicopter and boat raids. ``We're not in a
declared war and we have to take a step-by-step approach to applying
the military.''
   Those who favor military involvement, including U.S. Ambassador
Robert Gelbard, say army action is needed ``if Bolivia is going to
nip in the bud what is developing into a real national threat.''
   Cocaine traffickers operate beyond the law's reach in eastern and
northern Bolivia. They are believed to control entire towns that
police and U.S. drug agents won't enter for fear of attack by
townspeople.
   ``We have to find ways to cover these areas,'' Gelbard said in an
interview in La Paz. ``Bolivia is no longer just a producer of
(coca) leaf and paste. It is now is a major producer of cocaine
hydrochloride. If the problem is ignored, I'm afraid it really could
become another Colombia.''
   Gelbard noted that some air force units have been involved in the
anti-drug effort for years, flying a dozen Vietnam-era Huey
helicopters supplied by the United States. The navy also interdicts
drugs on jungle rivers.
   Some Bolivian critics draw parallels between escalating the drug
war and the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, expressing concern about
the increasing number of U.S. advisers and trainers in Bolivia.
   To that argument, Gelbard responds: ``You need advisers and
trainers to avoid the problems other countries have had, where
charred carcasses of U.S. helicopters lie in the valleys.''
   He said U.S. training had produced a corps of Bolivian air force
helicopter pilots that was ``the best in Latin America.''
   More than 100 U.S. civilian and military officials are involved
in the anti-narcotics campaign.
   Green Beret trainers run a base in the Chapare coca-growing
region.
   U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force advisers work with DEA agents and
the Leopards. U.S. border patrol agents and a special Coast Guard
unit carry out interdiction operations on roads and rivers.
   Some U.S. civilian personnel, such as DEA, Coast Guard and border
patrol agents, are allowed to take part in raids, but American
military personnel are limited to training and advising.

   Coca farmers who agreed to switch crops
waited hours to sign up for the government eradication program, two
months for officials to certify their coca plants had been destroyed
and several weeks to be paid.
   Samuel Zambrana, 61 with seven children, said he was going along
with the plan, but ``I have no income now and I cannot get my banana
and orange crop out because of bad roads. If the government is going
to take coca away from us, we need profitable alternative crops,
good roads and a market.''
   Since Dec. 1, farmers have destroyed a record 4,500 hectares of
coca, more than one-tenth of the 38,250 devoted to growing the crop
from which cocaine is made, according to U.S. government figures. A
hectare is about 2{ acres.
   ``We continue to be very pleased with voluntary eradication
programs and the commitment which the Bolivian government continues
to demonstrate,'' the U.S. Embassy said.
   Tens of thousands of farmers have left the Chapare coca-producing
region because of a sharp drop in prices for the leaf. Farmers
receive $2,000 from the Bolivian government for every hectare
destroyed.
   Voluntary eradication was spurred late last year, when Colombia's
drug war and increased interdiction in Bolivia disrupted cocaine
production and reduced the demand for coca leaves.
   A 100-pound sack of coca costs about $30 to produce and brought
only $10 at the beginning of May, compared with $100 five years ago,
but had risen to about $20 by the end of the month. The increase
caused concern that cocaine processing operations were resuming in
Colombia.
   Nearly one-third of the world's coca leaves are produced in the
Chapare, a lush, tropical region in the heart of Bolivia.
   At least 300,000 farmers depend on coca cultivation and cocaine
production for a livelihood. The government says the industry brings
about $600 million a year into the economy.
   Leaves of the coca bush, which resemble bay leaves, are harvested
four times a year, dried and then macerated into paste with kerosene
in plastic-covered pits. The paste is refined into cocaine in labs
in the Bolivian lowlands, Colombia and Brazil.
   Bolivia, which has a population of 7.1 million, is South
America's poorest country and its largest recipient of U.S. aid.

   Aweil is a place where everything is in
desperately short supply: food, money, medicine, hope.
   Especially hope, when survival can depend on whether the train
from Muglad arrives.
   As recently as December, 4,750 families waited in Aweil's refugee
camps _ about 30,000 people driven into the town by a seemingly
endless civil war. Despair drove most of them back to the
countryside, to the risk of death from war, lawlessness or famine.
   Only a few hundred women, children and old men are in the camps
now.
   ``Most of the families who left had been waiting for six to seven
months for the relief train,'' said Mohamed Ali of the local relief
committee. ``They saw no ray of hope so they moved out to the
villages, where they might find something to eat.''
   There is food at Muglad, a relief-distribution center 160 miles
north of Aweil at the northern terminus of a rail line. Goods
shipped from Khartoum, the capital 450 miles to the northeast, are
stockpiled there under Operation Lifeline-Sudan, a relief program
coordinated by the United Nations.
   Operation Lifeline was created after the famine of 1988, which
took between 250,000 and 500,000 lives and resulted from a civil war
that has raged in the southern part of Africa's largest nation since
1983.
   Black rebels in the south, which is predominantly Christian and
animist, demand greater autonomy from the Arab, Moslem north.
   The relief project was credited with preventing a recurrence of
the 1988 disaster last year, but getting supplies into the area has
been difficult.
   Trains often are weeks or months late in making the 160-mile
journey from Muglad to Aweil. Reasons range from the dilapidated
track and the danger of land mines or attacks by rebels, renegade
soldiers or bandits to bad weather, bureaucracy, inadequate
equipment and the reluctance of crews to risk the trip.
   At the end of May, a 150-car train with 1,500 tons of grain had
been waiting at Muglad for six months.
   ``We have only 400 gallons of edible oil and nothing else,'' said
the Rev. Akili Malweth, the local Roman Catholic bishop. ``Our
stores are as empty as a hungry man's stomach.''
   Four trains have brought supplies to Aweil since Operation
Lifeline began in 1989. On the return trip north, each carried
thousands of people trying to escape and survive.
   ``Those who could not move out of the town are the poor, the old,
the tuberculosis victims and the children,'' said Mohamed Ali, who
also is the local representative of the Sudanese Commission on
Relief and Rehabilitation.
   Nearly all those remaining are women, children and old men. They
are housed in two makeshift camps and few have money to buy anything.
   One camp has nine large huts that accommodate 20 families each
and the other is in the school. Alino Kolong, Aweil's education
commissioner, said those who lived in the school cleaned it each
morning before classes began.
   The women, and many of the children, try to find work.
   Refugee women till other people's gardens and carry firewood and
water from the center of town to outlying houses in Aweil, which has
a normal population of 11,000.
   ``Women here work in all sorts of jobs,'' said Majack Khawaja, a
resident of the town. ``Even building houses, which traditionally
has been a man's job, is now being done by women.''
   Even if the refugee women can find work, they seldom make enough
money to buy food.
   A cup of tea costs 10 Sudanese pounds, nearly 85 cents, double
the daily wage for the best-paying jobs available.
   ``They cannot afford to buy one sack of sorghum at the
unimaginable price of 900 pounds,'' or $75, for the 88-pound bag,
Kolong said. Sorghum is the staple food in Sudan.
   On a recent inspection tour, officials of the U.N. agencies
running Operation Lifeline found the refugee families had no
materials for cooking and were grinding peanuts in large bowls,
making paste so the nuts would go farther.
   ``All the people here eat is peanuts,'' Mohamed Ali said. ``It's
not because they like them; it's because they're cheaper.'' Peanuts
sell at one-third the price of sorghum.
   Although the people of Aweil looked relatively healthy, relief
officials said most had chronic tuberculosis or suffered from
malaria or other water-borne diseases.
   Aweil's drugstore had been empty for months.
   Dr. Samuel Deng, the area's only physician, said the medical
charity Doctors Without Borders brought enough supplies for a year
in February 1989, but no more had come. The group left Sudan after
some of its workers were killed.
   ``What medicine we have left cannot last for one week, let alone
until supplies come in no one knows how long,'' Deng said.

<HEAD>Feeding Center a Tenuous Lifeline for Sudanese Orphans</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Aweil-Camp Despair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AWEIL, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relief workers call the two mud-and-grass
huts a feeding center, but for 150 Sudanese war orphans, the
lifeline is increasingly tenuous.
   The children, whose parents and relatives were among hundreds of
thousands of civilian victims of civil war and famine, live with
hundreds of other refugee women, children and old men at Aweil, in
the embattled Bahr el-Ghazal region of southern Sudan.
   Each orphan has a tag attached to an arm or leg showing when he
or she entered the center and detailing medical care. Each has been
given a name, a nurse said, because ``everybody has to have a name,
you know.''
   All the children are members of the predominant southern Dinka
tribe. They have nothing outside the feeding center's two crude
huts, and inside they sleep on the earth floor.
   They have food _ cookies, high-protien gruel and milk provided by
the Roman Catholic charity Sudanaid _ and most are in relatively
good health.
   Considering the limited expectations of Aweil's children, that
makes the orphans of the feeding center luckier than many of their
famished and impoverished fellows, at least for now.
   The Rev. Akili Malweth, the local Catholic bishop, said the
center's food was being exhausted rapidly, and ``after that, we will
be at the mercy of the train.''
   His reference was to a relief train that had been waiting for six
months in Muglad, 160 miles away, to bring 1,500 tons of grain.
   Caretakers like Bishop Malweth try to maintain a semblance of
normality for the children of Aweil's camps, but it is difficult.
   Alino Kolong, the town's education commissioner, said fewer
children were attending school.
   ``Not all families can afford to buy school materials, and many
of the children here are orphans,'' he said.
   A notebook costs 25 Sudanese pounds, about $2, and a pencil 10
pounds, or 85 cents. There is little work for the refugees and none
that pays more than 5 pounds a day.
   Many pupils also stay away from school because ``some of the
families cannot afford to buy clothes for their children,'' Kolong
said, and ``we can't leave a naked child in the classroom with the
others.''
   Aweil has a hospital and a doctor. The hospital has only 75 beds
in a capacity of 150, and often is virtually empty because many
Dinka people prefer witch doctors.
   ``Sometimes a child is brought here and we hospitalize it,'' Dr.
Samuel Deng said. ``After 10 to 12 hours we discover that the child
has vanished,'' taken to a traditional healer by its mother.
   Most of those children die, he said.

<TEXT>
   Long before he met Oliver Hardy, Stan Laurel made
people laugh all by himself.
   He was the disaster-prone, stage-struck Lancashire boy, born
Stanley Jefferson, who set the stage on fire on the opening night of
a home theater.
   The first time he performed in a real theater, he squashed his
father's top hat, then ripped his best frock coat for an encore.
   Those were the little mishaps on the road to Hollywood, where
Stanley Jefferson in 1918 became Stan Laurel, star of 75 movies on
his own and co-star with Oliver Hardy 105 more.
   For Laurel's 100th birthday on June 16, however, all roads lead
to 3 Argyle St. in Ulverston, the northern town where Stanley
Jefferson was born.
   The attractions include the birthplace, the balcony in Coronation
Hall where Laurel and Hardy greeted townspeople in 1947, the Laurel
and Hardy Museum and the companionship of the Sons of the Desert,
members of the international Laurel and Hardy fan club.
   And what will they learn of their hero?
   ``A difficult one, that,'' said Bill Cubin, curator of the Laurel
and Hardy Museum. ``I don't think the surroundings could tell you
anything about Stan. His grandfather and grandmother were simple
Ulverstonian people.''
   Letters written by Laurel and now in the museum's collection
reflect happy memories of fishing in the canal, rolling Easter eggs
or shopping with Grandma Metcalfe. ``That was a big event for me,''
Laurel recalled in one letter. ``She used to buy me Beer's Treacle
Toffee. It sure was good.''
   The day after the birthday, a plaque will be dedicated at a more
significant spot: North Shields, near the mouth of the River Tyne
and clear across the country from Ulverston.
   In the attic of the family home in North Shields, A.J. Jefferson
built a theater for plays written, produced, directed and starring
his 9-year-old son, Stanley.
   John McCabe, an American actor and author of ``The Comedy World
of Stan Laurel,'' found much of the story of Laurel's early days in
an article written in 1939 by the father, a small-time impresario
who operated theaters here and there in Britain.
   As the senior Jefferson told the tale, Stanley cast himself as
the hero in the first of the attic productions and recruited for the
villain a boy named Harold, whose principal asset was a bulldog sort
of face _ and temperment.
   On opening night, the boys played a fight scene so intensely that
a lamp was knocked over and both boys were burned. One imagines poor
Harold spluttering, ``This is a fine mess!''
   Harold apparently wrote to Stanley about his disenchantment, and
it's unlikely that he was appeased by this reply:
   ``The fire was all your fault; if you had let go of my throat
when you saw my face going all red, we shouldn't have rolled over as
far as the lamps. You have lost nothing over the accident. I have
lost my theater. ... I am sorry about your eyebrows being burned
off, of course, but they will grow again.''
   The house is no longer standing, Cubin said, but Laurel devotees
can travel north to see the derelict Pickard's Theater in Glasgow,
Scotland, where 16-year-old Stanley Jefferson made his professional
debut.
   He was then working for his father at the Metropole Theater, on
the business side, but he fibbed to his father about wanting to
attend a party and sneaked off to appear at Pickard's.
   A.J. Jefferson was out strolling that night, wandered into
Pickard's and was surprised to find several pieces of his clothing
there, and his son performing in them. Stanley didn't notice his
father until he was taking his bows, and A.J. recalled the scene:
   ``Giving a subdued yell of horrified astonishment, he dropped my
topper which thereupon rolled toward the footlights. Stan pursued
it, tried to grab it and in so doing kicked it accidentally into the
orchestra where one of the musicians made a rush to retrieve it and
stepped on it, squashing it thoroughly!
   ``Then Stan made a dash for the exit but his luck was out. As he
ran off he came in contact with a steel hook fixed in the wings for
a trapeze act and the hook ripped off half the skirt of my beautiful
frock coat. Exit ... loud applause!''
   Stanley came back for more, playing the vaudeville circuit, and
his big break came with Fred Karno's comedy troupe.
   Soon after young Jefferson joined the troupe, they were
rehearsing a show called ``Jimmy the Fearless'' in London. The
troupe's star, Charlie Chaplin, decided the show wouldn't work and
refused to appear, so Jefferson got the part.
   The show was a hit, and within a week Chaplin consented to star _
but Jefferson stayed on as Chaplin's understudy and second banana.
   One of the treasures of the museum in Ulverston is a poster
advertising the Karno's troupe's appearance at the William Morris
American Music Hall in New York in 1911. Jefferson and Chaplin had
star billing.
   In 1912, the troupe returned to America where Chaplin resigned to
make movies for Mack Sennett. Stanley Jefferson became the principal
comedian, but the troupe folded a short time later in Philadelphia.
   Stanley Jefferson decided to stay. In 1917, he signed a contract
with Universal Studios and that same year appeared in a short film
titled ``Lucky Dog'' with Oliver Hardy.
   It wasn't until 1926, however, that they became a team in ``45
Minutes From Hollywood.'' It was the birth of one of the greatest
comedy teams in film history _ the reedy, hair-scratching Laurel
with his childish innocence and mischief, and the tubby tie-twirling
Hardy whose cherubic face belied a short temper when his partner got
them into ``another fine mess.''
   Laurel died in 1965. Hardy, whose 100th birthday is in 1992, died
in 1957.
   Laurel's solo films were highlighted this month in programs in
London and New York.
   The National Film Theater in London has already screened ``Just
Rambling Along,'' ``Somewhere in Wrong,'' ``Dr. Pyckle and Mr.
Pride'' and ``When Knights Were Cold.''
   Another program at the National Film Theater illustrated how
Laurel's comedy ideas were recycled in Laurel and Hardy films.
``Smithy,'' a Laurel solo in 1924 about a man who is mistaken for a
building contractor and builds a collapsible house, became Laurel
and Hardy's ``The Finishing Touch'' four years later.
   The National Film Theater had advertised a first showing of a
recently discovered Laurel and Hardy film _ it would be No. 106 _
but it is still not ready for showing, a theater spokeswoman said.
   On the birthday, the American Museum of the Moving Image in New
York will show five short silents made by Laurel before Hardy:
``Pick and Shovel,'' ``Collars and Cuffs,'' ``West of Hot Dog,''
``On the Front Page'' and ``Eve's Love Letters.''

<HEAD>Frogs, Salamanders Disappearing Worldwide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frogs, toads and salamanders are vanishing around
the world in a trend biologists say appears linked to the planet's
deteriorating environment.
   From the United States to India, to Japan and Australia,
scientists report whole amphibian populations have disappeared or
are declining, even in protected reserves.
   ``There is no consistent pattern,'' says University of Miami
biologist Marc Hayes. ``There doesn't seem to be any obvious global
cause _ except that almost all seem to be man-made.''
   Hayes, who heads the new national Committee on Declining
Amphibians, says humans should worry not only because of the loss of
animal species, but because amphibians' highly sensitive biology
make them the ``canary in the coal mine'' _ an environmental early
warning system.
   Amphibians _ including frogs, toads and salamanders _ were the
first land vertebrates. They appeared 400 million years ago, long
before dinosaurs, and about 200 million years ago evolved into
species similar to present-day varieties.
   That longevity now seems imperiled. Studies presented at an
international conference in February documented a sharp drop
worldwide in amphibian populations.
   Leopard frogs are no longer sighted in Canada. The common
European toad has disappeared from regions in Norway. Three species
of miniature frogs vanished from Puerto Rico. Salamander populations
are shrinking in the Western United States, and Japan reports
several frog species are in decline.
   A recently discovered Australian frog that fascinated biologists
because it hatched its young in its stomach apparently went extinct
in only one season. The Monte Verde nature reserve in Costa Rica
reports all of its amphibian populations have declined, and the
golden toad that once carpeted its forests may be extinct.
   Some causes of the phemomenon are known, and vary from country to
country. But cases such as the loss of frogs in Australia or U.S.
preserves leave biologists puzzled.
   ``In some of the areas that are the most protected, frogs are
disappearing, and we have no explanation for it,'' Hayes says.
``There are a whole suite of species that have disappeared from very
wide ranges in the United States.''
   David Wake, a University of California at Berkeley zoologist who
chaired the conference in February, says acid raid could be one of
the culprits killing off salamanders in the Colorado Rockies.
   Hayes says ultraviolet light is a known threat to frog's eggs,
and increased amounts of the harmful radiation entering through the
thinning ozone layer could be destructive. Another hazard for frogs
is stocking ponds with bass and other predator fish, especially in
areas where the animals evolved with no such enemies, and have no
ability to escape them.
   In the Everglades, Hayes notes, pig frogs were hunted for food
almost to extinction in the 1930s, and have never fully recovered.
That pattern is being repeated in India and Indonesia. The Monte
Verde disappearance could be due to changing weather patterns caused
by global warming, he says, or because frogs need many
interconnected habitats, and become isolated by roads and other
development.
   Wake says amphibians, which absorb large amounts of water through
their skins, are highly susceptible to heavy metals and other toxic
material often exhuasted into the air and water.
   Add widespread pesticide use, logging, dams, habitat destruction
and other local factors, and the amphibian population is in trouble.
   ``They are bio-indicators,'' Wake warns. ``It may not be
something that will hurt us directly, but they are telling us about
the loss of resiliance of our ecosystem, the loss of diversity.''
   The loss of amphibians also has some immediate noticeable effects
on man, the scientists say.
   The poison dart frog has a toxin in its skin that, when refined,
has been used successfully on an experimental basis for treating
heart conditions, says Hayes. In addition, frogs are a source of
food in many parts of the world.
   Wake says amphibians also are a key part of nature's ecological
balance.
   ``Frog tadpoles consume an enormous about of algae,'' says Wake.
``They keep our streams flowing clear and clean.''
   As adults, frogs move onto land, and become the top local
predators, consuming enormous amounts of small insects, including
mosquitoes.
   The demise of pig frogs in the Everglades could have a bearing on
the unexplained drop in wading birds, which have decreased by up to
90 percent since the beginning of the century, says Hayes.
   The variety of explanations and theories makes it clear there is
no panacea to solve the problem, says Wake.
   And he adds that no government agency is working on the problem
in any case. He has been in contact with several U.S. senators on a
project to create a National Institute for the Environment to
protect the nation's biological wealth, but says so far, the
amphibian problem in the United States is in the hands of
over-worked, under-funded state game commissions.
   Until there is more attention, biologists can only watch the
disappearance of amphibian species with alarm.
   ``When the canary died, the miner left,'' says Wake. ``Now the
canary is dying, but we've got to sit here _ where are we going to
go?''

<HEAD>Revered Archaeologist Still Under Attack 100 Years After Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLAIRE SPRINGETT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heinrich Schliemann, the 19th-century
German archaeologist credited with discovering the legendary city of
Troy, has come under fresh attack a century after his death.
   More than 200 archaeologists, historians and classicists gathered
in Athens to mark Schliemann's death and debate the legacy of the
man considered the father of prehistoric Greek archaeology.
   Schliemann, a grocer's son who became a millionaire, is famous
for excavating the ancient cities of Troy and Mycenae, and finding
Bronze Age civilizations at the sites whose existence previously was
unknown.
   But some experts have doubted Schliemann's integrity and the
reliability of the historical data he left his successors.
   ``My findings seem to show that Schliemann was a pathological
liar,'' David A. Taill, a classics professor at the University of
California at Davis, said in an interview.
   Controversy has surrounded Schliemann's findings since their
publication in 1874. His methods, primitive by today's standards,
have often been criticized.
   Still, many historians regard him as a pioneer in archaeological
discovery and say purported inaccuracies may be due to hasty
documentation.
   Taill, who spoke at the conference held last month, spent 10
years scouring records of Schliemann's excavations as well as his
diaries and letters.
   The professor said the value of an archaeological find depended
on knowing where particular pieces were discovered. Placement often
indicates age.
   ``Once it has been established Schliemann falsified some of his
finds, the question is how great is the damage,'' he said.
   The implications of any faking could be great. For example, his
data on the existence of settlements and the position of objects at
Troy have helped to determine the age of ruins throughout the
Anatolia region in Turkey. Troy is in modern-day Hissarlik, Turkey.
   Taill and others have challenged Schliemann's most dramatic
discovery _ a gold hoard he said was the treasure of legendary King
Priam.
   ``I'm fairly convinced he found some of the items separately and
put them together for a big bang at the end,'' Taill said. Taill
claimed that Schliemann, in different accounts, changed his
description of where he found Priam's treasure.
   Schliemann's account of finding the treasure with his wife,
Sophia, was false, because letters showed she was in Athens at the
time, Taill said.
   Taill's research added new fuel to a debate that has raged for
years. Schliemann's excavating techniques have long been debated,
with some people saying he destroyed valuable data by working too
quickly.
   Another expert, Edmund F. Bloedow, professor of ancient history
at Ottawa University, told conference delegates that differences in
Schliemann's accounts could be attributed to ``the inevitable haste
in making initial notes and sketches, and transcribing them.''
   Professor Manfred Korfmann of Tubingen University in West Germany
said Schliemann may have enlarged the King Priam trove with items he
bought. But Korfmann, who is excavating at Troy, nonetheless
emphasized Schliemann's pioneering of archaeological techniques.
   Questions about King Priam's hoard may never be resolved.
Schliemann said he found the gold, silver and bronze trove in 1873.
He gave it to Germany and during World War II it was stored in a
Berlin vault. It later vanished.
   Schliemann is esteemed for using archaeology as a means to
reconstruct historical periods.
   Before him, archaeologists generally dug to find sculptures to
enrich private and museum collections. Schliemann's attention to
small finds at different levels of the earth resulted in a more
accurate method of determining chronologies.
   ``With the publication of Schliemann's first reports on Troy,
archaeology, and prehistoric field archaeology in particular, began
to move ahead toward something entirely new,'' Korfmann told the
delegates.
   Taill, to underline his contention that Schliemann's integrity
was dubious, listed examples of how the archaeologist had allegedly
lied in his personal life.
   He claimed that Schliemann gained U.S. citizenship in 1869 by
lying about the length of his stay in the country.
   Schliemann also apparently falsified his diary, Taill said. A
June 1851 entry gives his graphic, eyewitness account of a major
fire in San Francisco. However, the fire was in May, when Schliemann
was in Sacramento, Taill said.
   ``Why would he lie in his own diary?'' he asked.
   Despite attacks on Schliemann's credibility, scholars admired his
skills.
   Schliemann, who died Dec. 26, 1890, at 68, immersed himself in
the poet Homer. Schliemann said he found Troy by following Homer's
descriptions of its location.
   However, historians point out that Hissarlik had already been
suggested as the likely site of pre-historic Troy.

<HEAD>New, Safer Breast Implants Being Studied</HEAD>

   A breast implant filled with peanut oil could
mean safer breast enlargements for thousands of women who have the
surgery each year, a radiologist says.
   Because the oil is transparent, the new implants do not interfere
with X-ray mammography for breast cancer the way silicone breast
implants can, said Judy Destouet, head of the mammography unit at
Washington University's Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology.
   ``They appear like the fat in the breast _ you can see through
it,'' Destouet said.
   Destouet and Leroy Young, associate professor of plastic and
reconstructive surgery at Washington University School of Medicine,
are heading the development of the new implant.
   The most common implant now is filled with silicone gel, which
appears as dense as bone in X-rays and therefore can hamper early
detection of breast cancer, Destouet said. Others are filled with
saline, or a combination of silicone and saline.
   ``I think many women need (breast augmentation) for self esteem,
and I think that we should have the freedom to do what we want for
our bodies,'' Destouet said.
   ``We hoped to develop a better product that would allow women to
augment their breasts but won't take away the benefits of
state-of-the-art mammography. We feel that we have something that
really can be a safe alternative.''
   Breast augmentation is one of the most popular cosmetic surgery
procedures available, according to the American Society of Plastic
and Reconstructive Surgeons Inc. in Arlington Heights, Ill. Some
72,000 women undergo breast augmentation each year, said spokeswoman
Cathleen Coyne.
   But some doctors disagree that implants interfere with early
cancer detection.
   Studies by Dr. Garry Brody at the University of Southern
California followed 3,000 women in the Los Angeles area who have had
breast augmentation.
   ``Thus far, the delay is theoretic only. It's certainly a
possibility, but when we look at the statistics, we can't find the
delay. Their cancer seems to be picked up at the same stage as the
unaugmented population.''
   The American Cancer Society estimates that one in 10 women will
develop breast cancer in her lifetime.
   Carolyn Cline, a plastic surgeon and psychologist in San
Francisco, said she discourages women with a family history of
breast cancer from having the surgery. ``But the average women, I
don't feel _ given the improvements in radiological techniques _
that it is a major issue,'' she said.
   The Washington University researchers have spent the last year or
so conducting tests on rats and rabbits to make sure their implants
have no adverse effects, such as allergic reactions or extreme scar
tissue formation.
   ``So far our animal studies are very favorable,'' Destouet said.
``There really are no side effects.''
   Once the researchers get U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approval, the implants will be tested in women. They could be
available commercially in about two years.
   Destouet said the researchers came upon peanut oil as a safe
implant filler when they turned to their chemistry books to find
which substances would allow X-ray penetration, and which of those
substances were not carcinogenic.
   The implants still use a thin silicone shell to hold the peanut
oil.
   ``We need a better envelope too,'' Destouet said. ``You can't
invent everything at the same time.''

<HEAD>Legionnaire's Disease Bacteria Survive By Hiding Inside Amoebas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists discovered how deadly Legionnaire's
disease bacteria can survive in chlorinated water, especially hot
water tanks in hospitals and other large buildings: The microbes
hide inside amoebas.
   ``Anywhere you have water that is tepid, you may have a
problem,'' said John Kuchta, chief microbiologist for the city water
department in Pittsburgh.
   The problem is unlikely in residential hot water tanks, which
usually are heated from the bottom, where heat kills the
sediment-dwelling microorganisms known as amoebas, Kuchta said
recently during the American Society for Microbiology's annual
meeting in Anaheim.
   But Kuchta and fellow microbiologist Jeannine Navratil found both
the disease-causing Legionella pneumophila bacteria and the amoebas
that hide them when they examined hot water reservoirs at hospitals
and universities. Those recirculating-water tanks weren't heated
from the bottom, but from the sides.
   Kuchta said the problem can be solved by superchlorinating water
for short periods of time and by increasing water temperature to 150
degrees Fahrenheit, which he acknowledged contradicts efforts to
conserve energy and prevent scalding burns.
   Legionnaire's disease was named after it killed 34 guests staying
at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia during a state
American Legion convention in 1976. An additional 221 people became
ill. The disease subsequently was recognized as a leading cause of
pneumonia among hospital patients.
   It is believed to be spread by inhalation of contaminated water
vapor, such as from tainted air conditioning units or, in a recent
case, from mist sprayed on produce in a grocery store. The disease
apparently isn't transmitted from one person to another.
   Scientists already knew Legionnaire's bacteria could multiply
only after they are engulfed by amoebas, members of a group of
single-celled organisms called protozoa.
   In laboratory studies, the Pittsburgh scientists found the same
process allows the bacteria to survive chlorination 10 times
stronger than is generally accepted as safe for disinfection of
drinking water.
   In addition to being physically sheltered from chlorine,
Legionnaire's bacteria also undergo biochemical changes when growing
inside amoebas, making the bacteria even more resistant to
chlorination.
   ``It may be difficult if not impossible to completely prevent
legionellae (Legionnaire's and related bacteria) and perhaps other
protozoan-borne pathogens from colonizing potable water'' tanks,
which can be disinfected only by superchlorination or high
temperatures, the scientists wrote.
   Kuchta said he is mainly concerned about hospitals, where hot
water often is 130 degrees or less ``for fear of scalding patients.
The bottom line is to make sure it is 150 degrees, at least for a
time,'' he said.

   The of Agriculture has issued
two publications to help consumers eat well.
   The fifth and sixth publications in the USDA's ``E U.S. Departmentating
Right''
campaign are ``Good Sources of Nutrients'' and ``Calories &amp; Weight:
The USDA Pocket Guide.''
   The pocket guide includes calorie values for nearly 400 foods,
and is a new version of one of the department's most popular
publications.
   ``Good Sources'' is a series of fact sheets that give the top
food sources of 16 vitamins and minerals and of fiber. A food is
considered a good source of a nutrient if it contributes at least 10
percent of the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance of the nutrient per
serving.
   Only foods containing moderate amounts of fat and sugar are
included, said Sue Ann Ritchko, administrator of the UDSA's Human
Nutrition Information Service.

<HEAD>House Ties High-Tech Exports to End of Lithuania Blockade</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: CORRECTS day of week in 2nd graf; also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers are threatening to block exports of
U.S. high technology to the Soviet Union until it ends its economic
blockade of Lithuania.
   By a 390-24 vote Wednesday, the House voted to bar the sale of
U.S. computers and telecommunications gear needed to modernize the
Soviet economy until Moscow begins negotiating Lithuania's
independence ``without economic coercion.''
   On a voice vote, the House also agreed to ban high-tech sales to
the Soviet Union if it continues to restrict Jewish emigration.
   ``While the Soviet president put out one hand in requesting aid
from the United States, the other hand is wrapped tightly around the
neck of Lithuania,'' said Rep. William Broomfield of Michigan, the
senior Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., who sought the Jewish emigration
provision, said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had ``played
into the hands of Arab extremists'' in remarks at a news conference
ending last week's superpower summit.
   Gorbachev said he was under pressure from Egypt and Syria to
start denying exit visas to Soviet Jews if Israel continues to allow
them settle in Israeli-occupied territories on the West Bank.
   Meanwhile Wednesday, the United States and the Soviet Union
signed another agreement on sharing food-processing information,
particularly how U.S. technology and methods can be incorporated by
the Soviets.
   And Yuri N. Chumakov, the deputy Soviet minister of foreign
economic relations, told a gathering of U.S. businessmen that his
country will be looking for U.S. loans under a new tentative trade
agreement.
   ``The United States is our greatest food supplier (and) we have
been paying with cash,'' Chumakov said. ``We have the right to
expect in this hard period to receive certain credits in order to
withstand the pressure.''
   The House votes on amendments to an administration-opposed bill
easing controls on high-tech U.S. exports was the first
congressional reaction to the trade accord signed by Bush and
Gorbachev last Friday.
   Moscow is particularly interested in acquiring U.S.
telecommunications and computer technology. During last week's
summit, for example, the Soviets signed an agreement with
International Business Machines Corp. to buy school computers.
   The Bush-Gorbachev agreement would lower 40-year-old trade
barriers between the two countries, but only upon the Supreme
Soviet's approval of a law to make it easier for Soviet citizens to
emigrate to or visit the West.
   However, many members of Congress want to condition any change in
trade relations with Moscow to its treatment of Lithuania and other
breakaway movements within the faltering Soviet empire.
   Since April 18, the Soviets have cut off supplies of oil, natural
gas, other raw materials and medical supplies to Lithuania in
response to its declaration of independence a month earlier.
   ``Although the Soviet Union is moving toward peace and openness,
it is not quite there,'' said Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., the
author of the measure to forbid high-tech sales to Moscow. ``The
Iron Curtain is still present when it comes to Lithuania and other
Baltic countries.''
   Through other amendments, House members also expressed
dissatisfaction with Bush's decision last month to extend Most
Favored Nation trade status to China despite the government's
violent reaction to the Tiananmen Square uprising a year ago.
   On a 393-15 vote, the House approved an amendment by Rep. Gerald
Solomon, R-N.Y., that would forbid Bush from approving any more
exports of U.S.-built or U.S.-owned satellites to China. The
amendment would not affect the export of three such satellites
approved last December by Bush.
   All of the votes were on amendments to a bill reauthorizing U.S.
participation in the 17-nation Coordinating Committee for
Multilateral Security Controls, which determines which Western
high-tech goods are too militarily sensitive to be sold to potential
enemies.
   The overall bill passed 312-86 despite administration veto
threats. Similar legislation is pending in the Senate Banking
Committee.
   ``The thrust of the bill is that business is more important than
national security,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. ``There are
military and intelligence aspects to some of these
telecommunications exports. We're crazy to hand that stuff to the
Soviet Union.''
   Supporters, however, maintained that ``cold warrior'' attitudes
should no longer dominate U.S. export policies.
   Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., said: ``We should accept our victory.
Eastern Europeans are going to spend upwards of $140 billion in the
next decade on telecommunications and we should get a chunk of it.''
   Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., cited a study by the National Academy
of Sciences estimating that the existing controls denied U.S.
companies $9.2 billion in exports in 1987 ``with no perceptible
increase in national security.''
   The bill basically eases export controls on telecommunications
equipment, computers and machine tools to the newly democratizing
countries of Eastern Europe and, to a lesser extent, the Soviets.
   U.S. manufacturers have repeatedly complained that the U.S.
export controls are effectively shutting out their participation in
Eastern Europe's developing economy while Japan, West Germany and
South Korea establish toeholds in it.

   Frank Lorenzo, acknowledging that he controls only
one airline today, said his Texas Air Corp. would change its name to
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.
   Although Texas Air technically still owns Eastern Airlines as
well as Continental, a bankruptcy judge in April ordered Lorenzo out
of the Eastern cockpit and appointed a trustee to run the
strike-bound airline.
   ``The name change was made to reflect the fact that the principal
business of the company is Continental,'' Lorenzo told shareholders
at the company's annual meeting Wednesday. The change takes effect
Monday.
   He told reporters later that the change doesn't mean Texas Air
has given up completely on Eastern, but he declined to comment when
asked whether he believed he would regain control of the carrier.
   The atmosphere at the shareholder meeting was a stark contrast to
the gathering last September, when Eastern was seven months into a
bitter labor dispute with its striking unions.
   Then, about 100 Eastern strikers picketed outside and chanted
anti-Lorenzo slogans, while those attending the meeting had to pass
through metal detectors.
   The protestors and detectors were absent this year, and even
Lorenzo couldn't resist mentioning that the quiet crowd of more than
200 was unusual for a Texas Air shareholders' meeting.
   Lorenzo admitted that the ``Eastern Airlines situation has been
very difficult for us.''
   On April 18, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland acted at the
request of Eastern's creditors and turned control of the airline
over to trustee Martin Shugrue, a former Continental boss and
Lorenzo associate. The move had been sought by the airline's unions
since the strike began.
   ``We don't believe that a trustee was warranted,'' Lorenzo said.
   But he said he remains concerned about the future of Eastern
employees, adding: ``We wish them and the trustee well.''
   Lorenzo said negotiations were continuing to determine how much
Texas Air and Continental will contribute to bolster Eastern's
pension plans.
   He said he had ``every reason to believe that these negotiations
will result in a settlement that is manageable and will not have an
adverse impact on our company, its financial health and its future.''
   The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a federal agency, has
estimated Eastern has about $830 million in unfunded pension
liabilities.
   Lorenzo brushed aside talk about the possibility of selling
Continental, telling shareholders that wasn't a ``priority.''
   He said there have been recent financial and operational
improvements at Continental. ``We're well-positioned to compete in
the service-driven marketplace of today,'' he said.
   Lorenzo announced at the meeting that shareholders had approved
the management-proposed slate of 14 directors, including four new
directors representing preferred shareholders.
   Texas Air had to expand its board after failing to pay dividends
to three classes of preferred shareholders for the past 1{ years.
The four directors elected to represent the preferred classes are
Lindsay E. Fox, Robert Garrett, James A. Lawrence and Gerald Tsai Jr.

   Stocks prices were higher at midday Thursday,
helped by a steady pound and weaker gold prices.
   The market moved from early lows to peaks at midday.
   Dealers pointed to a firmer pound against a basket of currencies
while gold touched $351.50 an ounce, its lowest level in four years.
   The brighter tone to the British equities market attracted more
institutional buying, which also has helped the market rise, one
dealer said.
   Shortly after midday in London, the Financial Times-Stock

   The stock market edged upward today in a sluggish
bid to recover from a two-session setback.

   Volume on the Big Board came to 53.74 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said the pullback in prices Tuesday and Wednesday
appeared to have attracted some ``catch-up'' buyers who had been
awaiting a chance to add to their stockholdings.
   Investors got some mild encouragement from the bond market, where
prices edged upward, putting yields on long-term Treasury bonds in
the 8.42 percent-8.46 percent range.
   Over the past several weeks government bonds have recovered about
half the ground they lost as interest rates rose earlier in the year.
   That has evidently prompted money managers at investing

<HEAD>Argentina Resumes Payments On Foreign Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentina has made a $40 million
payment to foreign creditors, the first since foreign debt payments
were suspended more than two years ago, government officials said
Thursday.
   Carlos Carballo, undersecretary of economy, confirmed that
payments had been renewed following ``arduous'' discussions in New
York between Central Bank Vice President Javier Gonzalez Fraga and
individual creditor banks.
   The payment, ministry sources said, is considered ``a gesture of
good will'' aimed at aiding Gonzalez Fraga in talks scheduled to
began this week with a consortium of private creditors.
   Argentina, the developing world's third largest debtor, owes a
total of $60 billion in loans plus unpaid interest that could reach
$8.5 billion by the end of the year.
   Ministry sources said the government hopes to negotiate an
agreement to pay $300 million in overdue interest by the end of the
year. The creditors reportedly have sought payment of $500 million.
   In the event negotiators reach agreement, Argentina would make
another interest payment of between $70 million and $80 million,
ministry sources said.
   The 11-month-old government of President Carlos Menem is seeking
debt forgiveness, approval for debt capitalization and new loans.
   Negotiations with a steering committee that represents private
banks, which are owed a total of $40 billion, are likely to be
difficult. Citibank, for example, reportedly has written off 40
percent of its loans to Argentina as uncollectable and resents
having done so.
   Nevertheless, the International Monetary Fund has indicated it
approves of Menem's policy of budget austerity and privatizations,
and recently unblocked payment of a $1.7 billion loan granted last
October and suspended five months later.
   Carballo said $240 million of the unblocked funds ``have already
entered the country'' and that a new installment of the same amount
would be disbursed by early August.
   Argentina is emerging from two bouts of hyperinflation and is
mired in recession. Inflation, which hit 96 percent in March,
dropped to 11 percent in April but is expected to be slightly higher
for May.

<HEAD>GM, Soviet Automaker Sign Joint Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. and Volga Auto Works, the
largest U.S. and Soviet automakers, signed a $1 billion deal
involving the purchase of GM-designed engine parts, the U.S. company
said today.
   The seven-year agreement marks the first automotive deal between
a U.S. and a Soviet company since the Great Depression. Ford Motor
Co. last year pulled out of joint venture talks with Soviet
companies, and Chrysler Corp. has no dealings with Soviet companies.
   GM will supply fuel injection, emissions control subsystems and
other engine components to VAZ for two of its cars sold under the
Lada nameplate. The program may be extended to other cars later, the
company said.
   Shipments of the GM parts to VAZ may begin as early as 1992 and
will continue through 1997. The first batches of components will be
made by GM in the United States and Europe, the company said.
   U.S. automakers have been looking for business in Eastern Europe
as political and economic changes occur. GM already has announced
vehicle manufacturing deals in Hungary and East Germany.
   Last February, GM's Allison Gas Turbine Division announced it had
signed a deal to supply up to 100 helicopter engines to the Soviet
Union beginning in 1992. The agreement could be worth $50 million to
$100 million during the 1990s, officials have said.

   The $630 million home-away-from-home for
E.T., Ghostbusters, Jaws and King Kong made its official debut today
with dozens of Hollywood stars joining Steven Spielberg to ``ride
the movies'' at Universal Studios Florida.
   The combination theme park and film production center features
high-tech entertainment on a big scale _ showing visitors how movies
are made while letting them in on the action.
   James Stewart, Charlton Heston, Bill Cosby and Michael J. Fox
were among the 50 or so top names parading down a replica of
Hollywood Boulevard in limousines to open the festivities.
   Sidney Sheinberg, president of the park's co-owner, MCA Inc.,
today called the 444-acre site ``a swampland turned into a
dreamland.''
   But the park wasn't totally up and running. Technical glitches
prevented some of the major rides from operating at a special party
for some 4,500 delegates to a travel industry convention Wednesday
night.
   Sheinberg and studio technical officials said ``most everything
would be in operation'' today but that problems and delays were
expected because of the complexity of the equipment.
   The park, owned by California-based MCA and London's Rank
Organisation PLC, features classic movie-themed rides and
``participatory adventures,'' many of which were conceived and
designed by film director Spielberg, Universal's creative consultant.
   Visitors go soaring with E.T., the Extraterrestrial, survive the
1906 San Francisco earthquake, agonize over an encounter with the
great white shark from ``Jaws,'' get buffetted in an aerial tramway
by a 3-story-tall King Kong and lose themselves in the live-action
Ghostbusters haunting.
   Universal also has the largest movie and TV sound stage area
outside Hollywood, Calif. Production has been under way since 1988,
and 13 feature films and 500 television episodes are to go before
the cameras this year.
   Universal is also the new home to Nickelodeon, the children's
television network, and the first Hard Rock Cafe in Florida.
   MCA is trying to grab a share of Florida's booming theme-park
industry, a business dominated by entertainment giant Walt Disney
World.
   The Disney-MGM Studios, based on the same concept but about half
the size of Universal Studios, completed its first year of operation
May 1. It recorded about 8 million visits in its first year, but the
turnstile count inflates actual attendance.
   Universal has a daily capacity of more than 40,000 and expects to
draw at least 5 million visitors its first year.
   MCA Vice President Jay Stein, who headed designing and building
of the Florida park, said he was confident of its success in the
face of the formidable competition a few miles down the interstate.
   ``It's a must-see attraction ... I don't think we're going to
eclipse Disney overnight. But we are going to bring lots of new
business to the area, and lots of repeat business to the area,'' he
said.
   Stein, a tough-talking taskmaster who started in the mailroom at
MCA 30 years ago, and his boss, Sheinberg, have had a running feud
with Disney Chairman Michael Eisner for years.
   They claim Eisner copied their idea for a movie-theme park and
rushed to build the Disney-MGM Studios before Universal could get
its act together. Eisner and other Disney executives downplay any
talk of a rivalry and instead tout the benefits of competition.
   Universal Studios Florida is also an important test of whether
MCA and Rank can export the same concept to Europe and Japan.
   ``We think there's a terrific market out there'' for high-tech
theme parks, Stein says.
   An announcement is expected soon on a similar enterprise to be
built either near London or Paris. MCA also has announced plans for
a theme park in Japan in partnership with Nippon Steel.

   Grain and soybean futures were higher in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Weather was key to the market once again as corn futures were
strongly higher over concerns about the size of the corn crop. Rain
in the southern Midwest could further delay planting, which has been
lagging because of soggy fields.
   ``People are nervous about the weather and what it will do to the
size of crops this summer,'' said Jerry Zusel, an analyst with
Balfour Maclaine Corp. in Chicago.
   Soybeans were being helped by the strength of corn.
   Wheat futures also were higher. Prices were boosted by news the
U.S. Agriculture Department has offered the Soviet Union two million
metric tons of wheat under the export bonus program.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents to 1} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.33\; corn was 2\ cents to 6\
cents higher with July at $2.83{ a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 2
cents higher with July at $1.47{ bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 4{
cents higher with July at $5.97} a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were mostly lower in trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle prices were pushed lower by professional and commercial
selling.
   Pork futures were lower on weak cash prices.
   Live cattle were .17 cent lower to .10 cent higher with June at
75.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent lower to .10 cent
higher with August at 85.45 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .43
cent lower with June at 65.62 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .15 cent lower to .70 cent higher with July at 66.75 cents a
pound.
   Livestock futures settled higher and pork futures lower in
Wednesday's trading.

<TEXT>
   Donald Trump's top executive in this
casino city today flatly denied the New York developer planned to
sell any of his gaming halls in the wake of reports of cash flow
problems.
   ``Let me tell you today there is no `For Sale' sign on the Trump
properties,'' said Ed Tracy, president of Trump's three casino
complexes and luxury hotel here. ``The properties are not for sale _
not Trump Plaza, Trump Castle or Taj Mahal.''
   Trump also operates the Trump Regency, formerly the Atlantis
Casino Hotel, as a hotel only.
   Tracy told a crowded news conference that the Taj Mahal Casino
Hotel, the $1 billion complex that opened with much fanfare in
April, will reduce its workforce of 7,200 by about 10 percent.
   But he cautioned that layoffs were routine following the opening
of a new gaming hall, and the Boardwalk complex would probably have
from 6,000 to 6,200 workers when it completes what is known in the
industry as its ``shakedown'' period.
   ``There's nothing new about this, '' Tracy said, noting that
Trump Plaza cut its workforce by 12 percent when it opened in 1985
under Harrah's management.
   Tracy refused to discuss any legal action involving Trump
himself. Bondholders for Trump Plaza and Trump Castle have sued the
Manhattan developer in U.S. District Court, contending his promotion
of the Taj Mahal has weakened the values of their bonds in the other
gaming halls.
   Tracy also rejected rumors that the properties are for sale
because bankers are pressuring Trump to cut back costs and because
the bonds used to finance the casinos are plummeting.

   U.S. businesses plan to boost plant and
equipment investment in 1990 at the slowest rate in three years, the
government said Thursday. The report reflected a sluggish economy
and weak product demand.
   The Commerce Department said a survey completed in May found
businesses planning to boost spending on expansion and modernization
by 5.5 percent to $500.4 billion. It would be the fourth consecutive
yearly increase.
   But while the spending projection would top the record $474.3
billion set last year, the rate of increase would be the slowest
since a 4.2 percent gain in 1987. Investments rose 8.9 percent last
year and 9.4 percent in 1988.
   ``It shows the manufacturing sector is responding negatively to
the sluggishness in that area,'' said Robert G. Dederick, chief
economist for the Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
   ``All one is looking for here is that it not be a drag on the
economy,'' he added. ``If it were a drag, it would be a heavy burden
on the economy given the other negatives such as defense spending
and housing.''
   Manufacturing and housing have been the sectors of the economy
hardest hit by the Federal Reserve's tight-money policy. Also, the
federal government has cut back on military spending because of
budget constraints.
   The new estimate is down from the 7.9 percent spending increase
in a previous survey completed in March. A survey completed in
November indicated a 4.9 percent investment gain this year.
   All of the figures have been adjusted for inflation.
   Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser for the WEFA Group in
Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said three factors were dampening investment plans
_ a soft economy and subsequent sluggish demand, weak profits and
cash flows, and high interest rates and tighter restrictions on
credit.
   ``The only thing keeping capital spending going now is the fact a
lot of companies realize if they don't modernize and improve
productivity and improve the quality of their products, they'll be
out of business eventually.'' he said.
   Replacing aging plants and equipment and expanding facilities
helps to boost U.S. productivity, an increasingly important factor
in view of the stiff competition American companies face from
overseas.
   The Labor Department reported Monday that American worker
productivity had plunged at a 2.7 percent annual rate so far this
year, the poorest showing since the 1981-82 recession.
   Any growth in business spending would help stimulate the economy,
now in its eighth year of expansion, and pick up some of the slack
from diminished consumer spending.
   Before adjusting for inflation, the department survey projected a
6.7 percent increase for all businesses this year to $507.2 billion
after gains of 10.4 percent last year and 10.5 percent in 1988.
   It said the investment increase for all industries includes a 3.4
percent gain for manufacturing firms and an 8.7 percent advance for
companies engaged in mining, transportation and other
non-manufacturing activities.
   Manufacturers are projecting investment spending this year of
$190.9 billion. The anticipated rate of increase is lower than the
average for all industries and down from the 4.9 percent projection
in April.
   The manufacturing gain includes a 2.4 percent hike in durable
goods _ big-ticket items expected to last at least three years _ and
a 4.3 percent increase in non-durables.

<HEAD>Corn Leads Surge in Grain, Soybean Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were higher
Thursday in trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Corn futures led the advance, as adverse weather conditions
continue to influence the market.
   There was more rain in the southern Midwest crop areas,
increasing the prospects for a smaller than anticipated U.S. corn
crop this year, said Susan Leighty, an analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   There was talk on the floor that as much as 3 to 5 percent of
intented corn acreage may not get planted, analysts said.
   Soybean prices were boosted by the strength of corn futures and
concern about planting delays. However, the jump in soybean futures
was limited by speculation that should the southern Midwest dry out
by mid-June, some of the intended corn acres will be switched to
soybeans.
   Corn needs longer to mature than soybeans.
   Wheat futures gained on concerns the wet weather has lowered the
quality and quantity of the winter crop and is delaying harvesting,
Ms. Leighty said.
   Wheat prices also received a boost from word the U.S. Agriculture
Department has targeted the Soviet Union for 2 million metric tons
of export bonus wheat.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 3{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.35 a bushel; corn was 4} cents
to 9{ cents higher with July at $2.85\ a bushel; oats were 2} cents

   Manuel H. Johnson unexpectedly announced his
resignation Thursday from the No. 2 job at the Federal Reserve,
creating a key opening at an agency often criticized by the Bush
administration for keeping interest rates too high.
   Johnson, 41, said he planned to return to an academic career.
   The Aug. 3 departure will give President Bush the chance to make
another appointment to the seven-member board that directs the
nation's monetary policy.
   The administration at various times in past months has been
openly critical of the Fed's efforts to restrain inflation by
keeping interest rates high.
   There was a published report in March quoting an unnamed Bush
adviser as saying the president was ``mad as hell'' with Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and would not reappoint him as
chairman.
   Bush later insisted there was ``no bubbling war'' with Greenspan,
but left the clear impression he would like to see more aggressive
action on the part of the Fed to lower interest rates.
   Analysts said it was likely that Bush would appoint someone to
the Fed who would be more amenable to the administration's pleas for
lower interest rates.
   ``This administration has been jawboning the Fed on and off for
some time for a looser monetary policy,'' said Kenneth Guenther of
the Independent Bankers Association of America. ``They want lower
interest rates because they don't want the economy moving into a
recession.''
   Fed officials have been pursuing a ``soft-landing'' approach for
the economy in which interest rates are used to slow growth enough
to ease inflationary pressures but not enough to tip the country
into a recession.
   Many analysts believe that approach is working and that the Fed
is unlikely to change course even with a new vice chairman appointed
by Bush.
   ``The Fed isn't closely divided now where one vote in either
direction would make much of a difference,'' said Lyle Gramley, a
former Fed governor and now chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers
Association.
   The White House would not discuss possible successors, but Deputy
White House press secretary Alixe Glen said the administration
believed Johnson had ``done a terrific job.''
   Bush will may either name someone new to the board and designate
that person vice chairman or select one of the other governors as
vice chairman while appointing someone to fill Johnson's board term,
which runs until Aug. 21, 2000.
   There was speculation that David Mullins, appointed to the Fed
earlier this year, might be considered for the vice chairman's job.
Mullins, one of the authors of the savings and loan bailout
legislation, had been a top assistant to Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady.
   Others mentioned as possible candidates for appointment were
Wendy Gramm, head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and
wife of Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas; John Taylor, a member of the
president's Council of Economic Advisers; and Treasury Under
Secretary Robert Glauber.
   ``The administration is likely to choose someone out of the same
mold as Mullins,'' said David Jones, author of a book on the Federal
Reserve and chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. ``He will be
a pro-administration Republican with an academic background.''
   Johnson had once been considered a top candidate to become Fed
chairman if the administration chose not to reappoint Greenspan next
year.
   Johnson said at a news conference that he fully backed the
reappointment of Greenspan and that policy disagreements were not a
factor in his decision to step down.
   While past Fed governors have cited the low pay as a reason for
resigning, Johnson said his $82,500 salary was not a factor in his
decision.
   ``The main reason I decided to step down is that I have spent 10
consecutive years in public service,'' he said. ``Ten years is long
enough.''
   Johnson was appointed to the Fed by President Reagan on Feb. 7,
1986, and was elevated to vice chairman six months later.
   He said his resignation would be effective at the end of his
four-year term as vice chairman.
   ``I am extremely proud to have played a part in the unprecedented
period of sustained economic growth and low inflation that has
characterized the decade of the 1980s and continues into the
1990s,'' Johnson said in his letter of resignation.
   Johnson said he planned to return to George Mason University in
Washington's Virginia suburbs and assume the Koch Chair in
international economics and become director of the Center for Global
Market Studies.
   He was a professor at the school in 1981 when he was selected to
join the economics team assembled by then-Treasury Secretary Donald
Regan in Reagan's first term.
   ``I deeply regret, but understand, Manley Johnson's decision,''
Greenspan said in a statement. ``The vice chairman and I have been
an effective team. I'll miss him.''
   The Fed, the nation's central bank headquartered in Washington,
is run by the board of governors and a nationwide network of 12
district banks. The governors are appointed by the president and
confirmed by the Senate to serve 14-year terms.

<HEAD>Iacocca Staying as Chairman; But for How Long is a Question</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca will stay on
as head of the financially struggling automaker after his contract
expires in 1991, the company said Thursday.
   ``There's a battle raging and I'm not going to leave my troops in
the field,'' he said in a statement after Chrysler's board meeting
in New York.
   It was unclear how long he would remain as Chrysler's chairman
and chief executive officer or how much it would cost the nation's
third-biggest automaker to keep him, company spokesman A.C. Liebler
said.
   Keeping Iacocca, 65, appears to be a stopgap move inspired by
last week's resignation of Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald, Iacocca's
hand-picked successor.
   ``He has just said that until he and the board determine together
that the company can continue to be equally effective without his
personal day-to-day involvement, he will stay around,'' Liebler said.
   ``One other thing is to put a succession plan in place,'' he
added.
   A year ago, Iacocca told Greenwald that the chairmanship ``was
yours to lose.'' But on May 31, it was announced Greenwald had
resigned to spearhead a three-union bid to buy United Airlines for
$4.54 billion.
   Iacocca, who loves the limelight, has waffled recently on whether
he would step down as chairman in December 1991 when his contract
expires.
   Unlike other auto company chairmen, Iacocca regularly appears in
television commercials and in print advertising, unabashedly touting
Chrysler and the United States.
   He has written two books, ``Iacocca: An Autobiography,'' of which
millions of copies were sold, and ``Talking Straight.'' He once made
a guest appearance on the television show ``Miami Vice,'' and
markets wine produced at his Italian estate.
   Even if Greenwald had taken over as chairman, Iacocca had been
expected to remain on the company's board of directors and play a
large role in the company's future. Some analysts speculated that
Iacocca's continued presence might be one reason Greenwald quit.
   Less than 24 hours after Greenwald's resignation, Chrysler
announced that Robert S. Miller, the company's chief financial
officer, would take over Greenwald's title and most of his duties.
Chrysler Motors President Robert Lutz got the rest of the duties,
but no new title.
   The changes prompted immediate speculation that Iacocca might
seek a new contract after 1991, since neither Miller, 48, nor Lutz,
58, appeared ready to become chairman in 18 months.
   The extension of Iacocca's tenure as chairman buys time for
Chrysler to groom one of them or find another heir for Iacocca.
   Greenwald was the highest-ranking of three executives who
announced in May they would quit Chrysler. Michael Hammes resigned
as vice president for international operations to head up hand tool
operations at Black &amp; Decker Corp., the Towson, Md.-based household
products manufacturer, and Treasurer Frederick Zuckerman said he
will quit sometime this summer.
   The drain on Chrysler's executive force began last October when
the company started a $1.5 billion cost-cutting program that will
result in a white-collar work force reduction of more than 2,500
people.
   Chrysler reported its first-quarter earnings were down 80 percent
from last year to $71 million, and analysts have predicted there
won't be any upturn until at least the fourth quarter.
   Chrysler's sales also have taken a dive. Through the first five
months of this year, Chrysler's car and truck sales were down nearly
13 percent compared with last year.
   Iacocca signed a four-year contract with the automaker in 1987.
He joined Chrysler in 1979 after being fired as president of Ford
Motor Co. by the late Henry Ford II.
   Iacocca's most lucrative year as chairman was in 1986 when he
received $20.5 million in compensation. His average annual
compensation since 1985 was $11.5 million. He received $4 million
for last year.
   The company's 1990 proxy statement says Iacocca will receive
191,250 shares of Chrysler stock this coming Nov. 2 and another
63,750 shares after Dec. 8, 1991. At recent prices, the stock would
have a combined value of $4.1 million.
   Iacocca's colossal compensation wasn't the only thing that put
the son of Italian immigrants into the news during the last decade.
   His name has popped up occasionally as a potential Democratic
presidential candidate, and he made news when he collided with the
Reagan administration over funding for the Statue of Liberty
restoration.
   He is engaged to be married for a third time after a stormy
divorce that ended an 18-month marriage to his second wife, Peggy
Johnson.
   Mary Iacocca, his first wife of 26 years, died in 1983.

<HEAD>Rally Runs Out of Energy in Oil Pits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Renewed selling stalled a rally in energy futures
Thursday and oil prices closed lower.
   Energy analysts said buyers flocked to oil futures in the early
going, building on the momentum begun in Wednesday's session. The
recent steep price slide encouraged buyers looking for bargains. But
the technical rally ran out steam in later trading once sellers
resumed unloading contracts.
   The contract July delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, closed at $16.67 a 42-gallon
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, losing 25 cents. That
more than wiped out Wednesday's 24-cent gain. Later months also
posted declines.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for July delivery, which moved 0.54
cent higher on Wednesday, fell 0.75 cent a gallon to 57.61 cents.
Contracts for later delivery ended lower also.
   The July contract for home heating oil dropped 0.41 cent to 46.90
cents a gallon after gaining 0.20 cent Wednesday. Subsequent months
also skidded.
   James R. Fiedler, an energy broker at E.D.&amp;F. Man International
Futures Inc., said the technical buying lacked any fundamental
support so the rally fizzled. He said an abundance of crude oil
continues to weigh on the market.
   In natural gas trading, the July contract increased to $1.573 per
1,000 cubic feet from $1.560 on Wednesday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 504 money market mutual
funds fell $804.8 million in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $380.73 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $121.1 million increase in the funds' assets
the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund
trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $392.14 billion in the week
ended March 21, 1990.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 241 general purpose funds increased $1.01 billion to
$130.30 billion, assets of 102 broker-dealer funds dropped $1.34
billion to $158.28 billion, and assets of 161 institutional funds
fell $475.3 million to $92.14 billion.
   ``Short term interest rates were stable last week, but buoyant
stock and bond markets drained some assets out of money market funds
and into long-term funds,'' said Jacob Dreyer, chief economist at
the institute.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.67 percent from 7.68 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 7.69 percent from 7.68 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 44
days, up from 43 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts was 6.20 percent as of Wednesday,
unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, remained unchanged at 5.06 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.94
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.96 percent
the previous week. Yields were 8.14 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
8.16 percent; 8.15 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.18 percent;
and 8.22 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.24 percent.

<HEAD>Icahn Plans to Sell 20 TWA Jets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl Icahn has
disclosed plans to sell 20 Boeing 727s in what union officials
called another scare tactic in his bid to gain concessions from
pilots.
   Icahn has promised to modernize TWA's fleet if pilots take 10
percent pay cuts and agree to other concessions that would save $80
million a year. He has threatened to shrink or dismantle the
troubled carrier if they refuse.
   Kent Scott, chairman of the TWA branch of the Air Line Pilots
Association, said Wednesday that Icahn may only be trying to get rid
of the old, relatively inefficient jets to make room for more modern
ones such as European-made Airbuses.
   ``Of course, he wouldn't let us in on that,'' Scott said. ``He'd
make it look like a liquidation to put more pressure on us.''
   Thomas Albrecht, an analyst for A.G. Edwards, said he also
doubted that the sale of the planes was the beginning of a
dismantling of the airline. He said Icahn would probably make no
drastic changes as long as he still saw a chance of selling the
entire airline to employees or an outside buyer.
   ``I've got to believe that if he was going to shrink the airline,
he wouldn't be doing it now,'' Albrecht said. ``He still wants to
keep it attractive.''
   The plan to sell the jets was disclosed this week when Icahn sent
out solicitations for bids to Avmark, an airline marketing and
consulting company.
   The current plan is different from earlier sales, analysts say.
TWA has sold 21 other jets since December in deals that generated
about $580 million in proceeds. All but two of those jets were
leased back to the airline, however.
   The current sale of jets is apparently an attempt to eliminate
the 727s from the carrier's 210-jet fleet.
   ``It does not look like a sale-lease-back type of arrangement,''
said Paul Turk, an analyst for Avmark.
   TWA and other airlines have been selling and leasing back jets to
capitalize on a strong market for used aircraft. Used 727s of the
type that TWA is selling have been bringing anywhere from $6.5
million to $12 million, Turk said.
   TWA could replace the 727s by leasing or buying some of the 100
Airbus A320s once destined for Braniff Inc., which went bankrupt
last fall.

<HEAD>Greyhound Given Permission to Pay Salaries, Expenses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge Thursday
authorized Greyhound Lines Inc. to pay salaries and operating
expenses after union attorneys made sure the strike-bound bus
company's executives would not receive ``golden parachute'' bonuses.
   A top Greyhound executive said after Thursday's hearing that
``illegal strike-related violence'' forced the company to file
Monday for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
   At the hearing, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Richard S. Schmidt ordered
the U.S. Trustee's office to start setting up a single committee of
unsecured creditors. He set the next hearing for June 28 in McAllen.
   Dallas-based Greyhound, the nation's largest bus transportation
company, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Monday to keep
buses operating through the peak summer travel season.
   The company has been hurt financially since a walkout three
months ago by its 6,300 bus drivers.
   ``We have been given the ability to use cash to continue to
operate our business in the ordinary course,'' George W. Hanthorn,
vice president and general counsel for Greyhound, said after the
hearing.
   He said the judge's order on operating expenses and an order
Monday allowing pre-bankruptcy tickets to be honored would keep the
buses rolling. Greyhound will have about 3,800 buses on the road at
any given time, he said.
   ``Our customers will not see any change in the business as we
have been operating,'' Hanthorn told reporters.
   Hanthorn blamed strike-related violence for the bankruptcy filing.
   ``Greyhound has spent literally millions of dollars in legal
fees, excess security costs, etcetera, to try to combat the illegal
violence that we face during the strike and I attribute it exactly
to that,'' he said.
   Smith Williamson, secretary-treasurer of the Amalgamated Council
of Greyhound Locals, rejected Hanthorn's contention.
   ``There's been a comedy of errors by (Greyhound chairman) Fred
Currey. He figured the strike would be over in three days and it
didn't work,'' Williamson said Thursday.
   ``Currey has to manufacture some reason why he's in this position
now, so he's laying the blame at the feet of the union.''
   Since the strike began, there have been dozens of incidents of
shooting and rock-throwing at buses. Early in the strike, a picketer
was crushed by a bus in California.
   Attorneys for Greyhound and the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound
Locals spent part of Thursday morning negotiating how Greyhound
intended to pay $2.5 million in salaries and up to $27 million in
other employee vacation, medical and workers' compensation benefits.
   The main sticking point was the $2.5 million in pre-bankruptcy
wages and salaries, including paychecks issued but not yet cashed.
Negotiators agreed to limit pre-filing wage payments to $2,000 per
employee.
   ``I just didn't want any golden parachutes adopted that would be
weighted in favor of Greyhound executives and against the wage
earner,'' said union attorney Shelby Jordan. Golden parachutes are
contract provisions that grant severance payments to top executives
if they lose their jobs in a change of control at their company.
   Asked whether he intended to seek a trustee to manage Greyhound,
Jordan said he had no ``plots or plans'' to ask the bankruptcy court
to take any drastic steps, and was waiting to see how Greyhound
handled the bankruptcy.
   Left unresolved is whether the company will have to pay back
wages to striking workers in an unfair labor practices claim set to
be litigated before the National Labor Relations Board in Washington
this fall.
   Judge Schmidt approved Greyhound's requests to pay $2 million in
accumulated COD payments owed to various shipping customers, and to
honor pre-filing deposits for charter trips.
   Court documents indicate Greyhound's largest unsecured creditors
are financial services and insurance companies. But a list of debt
holders stretches out over 1,800 pages, ranging from junk bond
holders to parts and tire suppliers.
   Schmidt also allowed the company to file a single disclosure
statement for all six Greyhound entities involved in the bankruptcy.
   The courtroom was packed with 18 attorneys for various parties in
the case, including Greyhound, the union and creditors.
   The preliminary order allowing operating expenses lasts until the
June 28 hearing.
   Schmidt also allowed the company to hire the Houston law firm of
Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges as its lead counsel.
   An hour before the hearing, Greyhound announced it was
withdrawing a tender offer for junk bonds.
   ``We have withdrawn our tender offer so that we can focus on
mapping out a sound debt restructuring plan for the court,'' said J.
Michael Doyle, senior vice president and financial officer.
   On May 21, Greyhound asked holders of $225 million of its junk
bonds to sell them back at steep discounts, totaling about $90
million. The company said the move was crucial to avoid the
bankruptcy filing.
   The offer was to expire June 18.
   Greyhound attorneys said they filed in Brownsville because its
Eagle Bus Manufacturing Inc. subsidiary is based in the South Texas
city.

   Stock prices gave ground in a sluggish session
Thursday, posting their third straight loss since the market reached
a record high at the start of the week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 14.32 to
2,897.33, extending its decline over the last three sessions to
37.86 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
638 up, 852 down and 528 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 160.42 million
shares, against 164.02 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 193.35 million shares.
   Stock traders appeared to drew cautious conclusions from activity
in the bond market, where prices were little changed to slightly
higher. Yields on long-term Treasury bonds hovered in the 8.43
percent-8.46 percent range.
   Over the past several weeks government bonds have recovered about
half the ground they lost as interest rates rose earlier in the
year. That has evidently prompted money managers at investing
institutions to pump some of their large cash reserves into stocks.
   But over the past couple of days uncertainty has evidently
increased over whether rates can keep going down.
   Brokers also say misgivings persist over the chances for a
recovery any time soon in profits of companies whose fortunes are
closely linked to the domestic economy.
   The Federal Reserve has indicated its reluctance to shift to a
more stimulative credit policy even though the latest statistics
show slower-than-expected growth in business activity.
   Precious-metals stocks were broadly lower, extending their recent
slide as the price of gold remained under pressure. ASA Ltd. fell 1~
to 44|; American Barrick Resources ~ to 16{; Homestake Mining 1 to
16}; Battle Mountain Gold } to 11{, and Newmont Gold 1| to 39}.
   USX dropped &rsqb; to 33|. The company said a vote count showed that
shareholders rejected a proposal from Carl Icahn, a major investor
in the company, that it spin off at least 80 percent of its steel
operations.
   Other losers among the blue chips included Coca-Cola, down | at
44}; General Motors, down { at 49&rsqb;; International Paper, down | at
51|, and Exxon, down \ at 47|.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $14.24 billion, or 0.41
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .94 to 198.21.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.88 to 422.73, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down 1.81 at 363.15.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market dipped
.87 to 464.09. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 363.57, down .62.

   Gold prices fell Thursday, briefly reaching their
lowest levels in four years as traders lost interest in buying the
metal.
   Meanwhile, the dollar was mostly higher against other major
currencies in uninspired trading.
   Gold, which has slumped in recent months, has become increasingly
unattractive to investors. Producer selling also contributed to
Tuesday's decline, said David Ryan, chief bullion trader for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Bullion fell $2.80 to $354.60 a troy ounce on the New York
Commodity Exchange. Republic National Bank of New York later quoted
a bid of $353.60 a troy ounce, down $3.15 from late Wednesday.
   Earlier, prices tumbled overseas with gold falling to a low of
about $351.50 in mid-morning London trading. That was the lowest
level for the metal in nearly four years.
   Prices recovered somewhat in Europe as Middle Eastern buyers
began to buy heavily as gold reached its lows for the day.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $354.15 a troy ounce
from $359.50 late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing
bid of $353 from $358.60 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $5.75 to close at a bid $355.67.
   Silver fell in London to a late bid price of $5.01 a troy ounce,
down from $5.085 late Wednesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver slipped 1.7 cents
to close at $5.013 a troy ounce.
   The dollar was mixed in lackluster trading. Ronald Holzer, chief
foreign exchange dealer, Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago, said the
market was waiting to see what fallout there might be from the
upcoming German monetary unification, and was also waiting to see
whether the Federal Reserve would adjust its credit policy.
   The dollar began its day in Tokyo, falling 0.05 yen to a closing
152.55 yen. Later, in London, it also was quoted at 152.55 yen, and
in New York, it fell to 152.55 yen from 152.68 late Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound held steady at $1.6880, but it
gained ground against the dollar in New York, rising to $1.6895 from
$1.6875 on Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
late prices, included: 1.6930 West German marks, up from 1.6885;
1.4445 Swiss francs, up from 1.4365; 5.7035 French francs, up from
5.6905; 1,244.75 Italian lire, up from 1,242.00; and 1.16975
Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's
prices, included: 1.6913 West German marks, up from 1.6870; 1.4385
Swiss francs, up from 1.4280; 5.6993 French francs, up from 5.6870;
1.9028 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8980; 1,244.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,241.00; and 1.1678 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1723.

   Precious metal futures prices fell Thursday on New York's
Commodity Exchange, with gold prices approaching four-year lows.
   On other markets, energy futures resumed a slide; grain and
soybean futures were higher; and livestock and pork futures were
mixed.
   Gold traders reacted to overnight selling by the Japanese and
traders in the Middle East by selling. Traders said gold prices
approached their lowest levels since mid-1986.
   ``This is the third time in as many months that the Arabs have
sold gold,'' said Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst Jim Steel.
   Steel said Middle East investors are shifting portfolios out of
gold into other financial instruments, including sterling and U.S.
treasury bonds, because of rising interest rates.
   Adding to pressure on gold were fears the Soviet Union again will
enter the market and sell gold to pay for imports.
   Gold settled $2.80 to $3.40 lower with the contract for delivery
in June at $354.60 a troy ounce; silver was 1.7 cents to 2.3 cents
lower with June at $5.013 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures, after trading higher for most of the day,
finished lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The market rose at the start of trading as investors continued to
take advantage of low prices, said Randolph Donney, an energy
analyst with Merrill Lynch.
   Reports that Exxon Corp.'s Bayway, N.J., refinery was back in
business after a maintenance shutdown triggered a sell-off, he said.
Exxon later announced it was resuming product shipments from the
plant, but production of finished products would not resume until
the end of June.
   Analysts attributed market nervousness to overproduction by
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and to
a large build-up of gasoline, distillate and crude oil stocks.
   West Texas Intermediate crude was 19 cents to 26 cents lower with
July at $16.67 a barrel; heating oil was .21 cent to .41 cent lower
with July at 46.90 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .60 cent to
1.25 cent lower with July aat 57.61 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures were higher on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Corn futures led the advance, as adverse weather conditions
continue to influence the market.
   There was more rain in the southern Midwest crop areas,
increasing the prospects for a smaller than anticipated U.S. corn
crop this year, said Susan Leighty, an analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   Soybean prices were boosted by strong corn futures and concern
about planting delays. But the jump in soybean futures was limited
by speculation that some intended corn acreage will be switched to
soybeans if the southern Midwest dries out by mid-June. Corn takes
longer to mature than soybeans.
   Wheat futures gained on concerns the wet weather has lowered the
quality and quantity of the winter crop and is delaying harvesting,
Leighty said.
   Wheat prices also received a boost from word the U.S. Agriculture
Department has targeted the Soviet Union for 2 million metric tons
of export bonus wheat.
   Wheat was 1\ cents to 3\ cents higher with July at $3.34} a
bushel; corn was 4} cents to 9{ cents higher with July at $2.85{ a
bushel; oats were 2\ cents to 3 cents higher with July at $1.49\ a
bushel; soybeans were 8} cents to 11{ cents higher with July at
$6.02} a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Live cattle were .03 cent to .10 cent higher with June at 75.32
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .53 cent lower with
August at 85.10 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to 1.23 cents
lower with June at 64.82 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
unchanged to 1.35 cents higher with July at 67.40 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Government Investigating Norton Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government will investigate whether the
proposed merger between Norton Co., a U.S. manufacturer with defense
contracts, and a French company raises national security concerns,
it was announced Thursday.
   Executives announced the $1.8 billion merger between Norton and
France's Compagnie de Saint Gobain this spring, thwarting a hostile
bid made by a British company, BTR PLC, for Worcester-based Norton.
   When BTR was fighting for control of Norton, Massachusetts
politicians said they would try to block the bid because Norton's
technology should be protected.
   But when Saint Gobain, one of the world's leading glass makers,
came forward to rescue Norton with a friendly tender offer,
government officials said the deal might have to come under the same
review.
   With the news of the investigation Thursday, Norton's stock
dropped $1.50 a share to $87.87{ in fairly active trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Norton is a leading manufacturer of abrasives and engineering
materials that has defense contracts with the U.S. government. The
company, with 1989 sales of $1.5 billion, employs 16,000 people and
operates 113 plants worldwide.
   Tom Ryan, a spokesman for Saint Gobain, said the company learned
of the decision to proceed with the investigation from the Committee
on Foreign Investment in the United States.
   ``We certainly knew it was a possibility,'' Ryan said. ``Our
position is there should not be any problems.''
   The investigation is scheduled to last 45 days.
   The $90-per-share tender offer was scheduled to expire Friday,
but Saint Gobain has extended it to June 27.
   So far, 41.4 percent of Norton's outstanding shares of common
stock have been tendered. Ryan said many shareholders appear to be
waiting a decision from the federal government.

<HEAD>Two Measures Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended May 28, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,258.6 billion from $3,266.4 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,052.6 billion from $4,063.4 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $803.7 billion from $806.9 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 3.5 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 was 1.1 percent, below the Fed's target
range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent. The Fed has not set a target
for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,268.0 billion, a 4.4
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $4,065.2 billion, up 1.6 percent, while M1 rose
4.6 percent to an average of $805.7 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $172 million,
compared with a decline of $1.157 billion a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $442 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$924 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $401 million
in the two weeks ended May 30, down from $645 million in the
previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $305.0 billion in the two-week period ended May 30, down from
$306.0 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Report: Louisiana, Texas Plants Release Most Toxic Chemicals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plants in the petrochemical and industrial
belts of Louisiana and Texas release the most toxic industrial
chemicals, but pockets of significant toxic pollution exist across
the nation, a private group said Thursday.
   ``Nearly every state in the nation has become a dumping ground
for toxic chemicals by the nation's largest manufacturers,'' said
Robert Brandon, vice president of Citizen Action.
   Citizen Action, a Washington-based environmental and consumer
group, said that Jefferson Parish and St. Charles Parish in
Louisiana and Sedgwick County in Kansas had the largest releases of
toxic industrial chemicals in 1988.
   All three areas have major chemical companies and industrial
plants that use large amounts of solvents.
   The organization used statistics published earlier this year by
the Environmental Protection Agency, compiled from annual reports by
industrial plants to the agency.
   According to the EPA, 4.6 billion pounds of toxic chemicals were
released by industry into the air, water and into the ground in
1988, the latest year for which data were available. The EPA has
said it could not estimate the resulting health risks because it has
no information on the extent of human exposure to the chemicals.
   Citizen Action gave the total as 6.2 billion pounds. The group
included 1.6 billion pounds sent away for disposal or to municipal
treatment facilities. The EPA does not consider the 1.6 billion
pounds to have been released into the environment.
   Of the total releases cited by Citizen Action, about half of the
chemicals were released in 10 states: Louisana, Texas, Ohio,
Indiana, Illinois, Tennessee, Michigan, California, Pennsylvania and
Florida.
   Major toxic polluters, however, were found in many parts of the
country.
   The Eastman Kodak Co., was the second largest source of
cancer-causing emissions, the group said. Its complex of plants in
Rochester, N.Y., released more than 9.7 million pounds of
cancer-causing chemicals. The company in the past has said the
releases are not a health hazard.
   The 3M Corp., a Minneapolis-based manufacturer of a variety of
products such as recording tape and sandpaper, led the list of
companies releasing chemicals that may be linked to birth defects.
It released 53 million pounds of such chemicals, including 16
million pounds from a plant in Hutchinson, Minn., the group said.
   Rick Renner, a 3M Corp. spokesman, said the company has an
extensive pollution control effort underway and the 1988 figures do
not reflect new controls as some of the company's factories. ``Our
emissions will be down substantially this year,'' he said.
   Sedgwick County in Kansas, containing Wichita, was the third most
polluted county on the list largely because of Vulcan Chemicals,
which has a plant there, and the widespread use of solvents at a
Boeing Co. plant.
   Vulcan's releases are mostly through the injection of chemical
wastes into deep wells. Industry says such releases are a safe
disposal method, but environmentalists say they could threaten
groundwater.
   Southern California ranked high on emissions largely because of a
concentration of petrochemical, plastics, aerospace and other
industrial plants, the environmental group said.
   Citizen Action is a Washington-based federation of consumer and
environmental groups in 27 states and claims more than 2 million
members.
   Spokesmen for the Chemical Manufacturers Association simply noted
that the Citizen Action report was based on data that had been made
public previously. The industry group in the past has acknowledged
that toxic releases from chemical plants are too high and says its
member companies are working to reduce them.

<HEAD>Government Spends More Than Double To Fight Dollar Rise In
Feb.-April Period</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government boosted its efforts to stem the
dollar's rise against the Japanese yen from February through April,
but by the end of the quarter it was market sentiment that actually
stopped the climb, the Federal Reserve said Thursday.
   The Fed and the U.S. Treasury sold $1.78 million in the three
months ended April 30, nearly 90 percent of it to buy yen, the Fed
said in its quarterly foreign exchange report. The remaining $200
million was used to buy West German marks.
   In the previous three months, October through January, the
government spent $750 million intervening in currency markets, all
of it to buy yen.
   Although purchases more than doubled in the latest quarter, it
was ``far, far lower than the earlier three-month period last
year,'' Sam Y. Cross, a Fed executive vice president who released
the report at a press conference.
   The government's purchases last year included a record $11.92
billion in yen and marks during the three months ended July 31 and
$5.871 billion in the following three months.
   The dollar rose 10 percent against the yen during the
February-April period this year while declining by less than 0.5
percent against the mark.
   The dollar saw its steepest climb of the period against the yen
from late February through early April. The climb subsided as the
market awaited the April 7 meeting of financial officials from
governments of the so-called Group of Seven leading industrial
nations, the Fed said.
   Also, in April, the market came to view the Bank of Japan's 1
percent increase in its discount rate as sufficient to lessen
downward pressure on the yen. Then, the Japanese stock and bond
markets began to recoup some of their losses, according to the
report.
   The dollar hit a low for the period of 143.6 yen on Feb. 19, but
began to rally after election victories for the Liberal Democratic
Party in Japan and predictions that interest rates outside Japan
could rise, further weakening the yen. The government sold $650
million to buy yen between February 23 and March 2.
   Also, fears that German inflation would accelerate due to the
pending currency union between East and West Germany strengthened
the dollar against the mark. It reached 1.7237 marks on March 1.
   Between March 5 and March 27, the Treasury sold $830 million to
buy yen and sold $200 million for marks. The purchases were made by
the U.S. Treasury as the Fed temporarily put its intervention
program on hold. The Fed and Treasury normally split the funds used
for intervention.
   The temporary halt in intervention came after some Fed officials
said they were concerned that high amounts of purchases like those
in 1989 could cause doubts about the Fed's commitment to curbing
inflation, according to the report.
   The government's currency-intervention programs can have the
unintended effect of increasing the supply of dollars and some
feared inflation could result.
   Furthermore, the Fed's holdings of foreign currencies were
approaching the $21 billion authorized by the Federal Open Market
Committee. The Fed decided to stop making purchases until the
committee's March 27, meeting where an additional $4 billion in
holdings were authorized. Also, the FOMC decided to retain
tight-money policies.
   The government intervened twice more, on March 28 and April 9,
selling $50 million for yen each time.

<HEAD>Hollywood Stars Make Up for Glitches at New Florida Park</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jaws failed to terrify boaters and King Kong
swung from a bridge only sporadically, but Universal Studios opened
its $630 million attraction Thursday to an enthusiastic crowd with
50 Hollywood stars in their eyes.
   ``Isn't he cute, isn't he short and cute,'' teen-ager Marla
Working said of Michael J.Fox, one of the stars brought in for
inaugural ceremonies at the combination theme park and
film-production center.
   Even as Universal Studios Florida was being inaugurated,
executives of parent companies MCA Inc. and Rank Organisation PLC,
were announcing plans for similar theme parks in Europe and Japan
and for a second gated attraction on the 444-acre property in
Orlando.
   But few details were available on the future projects.
   Universal, which will compete with the nearby Disney-MGM Studios
for some 13 million annual visitors to Central Florida, experienced
opening day glitches with some of its major rides.
   The six-story tall Kongfrontation sound stage was closed to the
general public because the six-ton steel-and-fur monster was able to
go through his computer-activated terror routines only in stages. A
program that melds all the segments into one smooth, hopefully
frightening performance was inoperative, a company spokesman said.
   A similar problem afflicted the 24-foot killer shark Jaws.
   Technicians temporarily placed off limits a boat ride across the
Amity Lagoon during which passengers are attacked by the
computerized razor-toothed shark.
   A re-creation of a San Francisco earthquake for passengers aboard
a subway train was only in partial operation, and actor Charlton
Heston _ who starred in the movie ``Earthquake'' _ became the main
attraction at that site.
   ``I think most of our visitors saw all the movie stars as a
trade-off for the problems with the rides,'' said company spokesman
Joe Curley. ``But we offered full refunds to anyone who was really
put out by some of the rides being closed... We had only a few
takers.''
   Fox and Heston were joined by Bill Cosby, Linda Blair, Jimmy
Stewart, Ernest Borgnine, Sissy Spacek and dozens of other stars.
   MCA President Sid Sheinberg praised park creator Jay Stein for
turning ``swampland into dreamland'' and took note of the company's
competitor down the road.
   ``Universal Studios Florida is the beginning of the symbiotic
process of filmmaking and tourism in Florida,'' Sheinberg told some
1,500 invited guests to the inaugural ceremonies.
   Stein said there would be an announcement later this year about
the new park's expansion plans, including a second gated attraction,
for which tickets could be purchased separately.
   Sheinberg, who just returned from Europe, said he hoped an
announcement could be made in two or three months about the
selection of a new theme park site either in Paris or London.
   ``Personally, I'd like to see it in Britain,'' said Sir Patrick
Meaney, Chairman of the Rank Organisation of London. But, he said,
``We are equally supported by both governments.''
   Universal also plans a park in Japan with Nippon Steel.
   Universal Studios Florida has a capacity of about 40,000, but
officials have said attendance would be held below 20,000, if
necessary, for the first few weeks until the shakedown process for
both personnel and the high-tech equipment is completed.
   Universal hopes to attract about 5 million visitors in its first
year, and Stein told reporters that ``somewhere between 3 or 4
million people would put us in the black.''

<HEAD>Wasserstein Perrella To Buy Maybelline Cosmetics From
Schering-Plough</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schering-Plough Corp. has agreed to sell its
Maybelline cosmetics business for $300 million to an affiliate of
the buyout specialists Wasserstein Perella, the companies said
Thursday.
   At the same time, the pharmaceutical giant said it had terminated
an earlier agreement to sell Maybelline for the same price to a
group made up of Playtex Family Products Corp. and executives from
Playtex and Maybelline.
   Wasserstein's announced purchase of Maybelline, the leading
cosmetics manufacturer in the U.S. and Canada, came the same day it
completed buying Yardley-Lentheric, a British cosmetics and
toiletries business, for $185.4 million.
   Wasserstein executives characterized the two acquisitions as
long-term investments, and said they planned to set up a holding
company that would own and run both businesses.
   ``These companies are absolutely not'' for sale, said Robert B.
McKeon, co-president of Wasserstein Perella Management Partners, Inc.
   An affiliate of its merchant banking arm, Wasserstein Perella
Partners LP, made the purchase.
   A spokesman for MBP Acquisition Corp., the Playtex affiliate,
refused to comment on why its April agreement to buy Maybelline fell
apart.
   ``Playtex tried to get a price reduction on the April deal, so
Schering-Plough turned to Wasserstein,'' who had earlier expressed
an interest in Maybelline, said an executive who declined to be
identified.
   Wasserstein said it is financing the deal without high-yield
``junk'' bonds.
   ``We're doing this with strictly a healthy dose of equity and
bank debt,'' McKeon said.
   The final details of the financing have yet to be ironed out, but
the mix would be about 30 percent equity and 70 percent bank debt,
McKeon said.
   Wasserstein's purchase of Maybelline is contingent on routine
government approval of all sales of companies over $100 million.
   Most of Schering's $300 million in cosmetics sales in 1989 were
generated by Maybelline, a Schering spokesman said.

<HEAD>Paramount Chairman Testifies About Boesky Pursuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Martin S. Davis, chairman of Paramount
Communications Inc., testified Thursday that Ivan Boesky in 1985
doggedly pursued a leveraged buyout of Paramount's predecessor, Gulf
&amp; Western Industries Inc., and threatened a takeover fight.
   Despite repeated rejections, Boesky ``did not accept no as an
answer,'' Davis said at the federal securities fraud trial of former
Boesky associate John A. Mulheren Jr.
   ``The more we said no, the more he asked us to think about it, so
in order to facilitate his leaving, we said we'd think about it,''
Davis testified under questioning from Assistant U.S. Attorney E.
Scott Gilbert.
   Mulheren, 40, is accused of inflating the stock price of Gulf &amp;
Western to $45 in October 1985 by purchasing 75,000 shares to help
Boesky make more money in selling his stake back to the company.
   Boesky, who previously testified at the trial, paid $100 million
in penalties and pleaded guilty to one felony to settle the biggest
insider trading case ever. In exchange, he gave government
investigators incriminating information about several associates,
including Mulheren.
   Davis said he first met with Boesky on Sept. 5, 1985, amid rumors
and media reports that Boesky and others were contemplating a
takeover of Gulf &amp; Western after it sold off its manufacturing and
textile holdings for $1 billion in cash.
   At the meeting, attended and arranged by investor Carl Icahn,
Davis said Boesky told him he held 4.9 percent of Gulf &amp; Western's
stock and proposed that Davis agree to a leveraged buyout at $50 per
share.
   When Davis rejected the proposal as ``ridiculously low,'' Boesky
said he would increase his holdings to 9.9 percent and then demand
two seats on the company's board.
   Davis, then chairman of Gulf &amp; Western, said his response to
Boeksy's proposal was ``an emphatic no.''
   He said Icahn also held 4.9 percent of the company's stock, but
told him he was not a party to Boesky's proposal.
   At a second meeting, on Oct. 1, 1985, Davis said Boesky continued
to persist in his leveraged buyout proposal, telling Davis he could
personally earn $100 million to $200 million.
   Davis testified he told Boesky he had no interest in doing
business with him, especially in a plan that he thought would
disenfranchise shareholders.
   Boesky then offered to sell back his holdings in Gulf &amp; Western
at $45 per share, which was higher than its trading price on the New
York Stock Exchange, Davis said. David testified that he said he
would only buy back the stock at the market price.
   Davis said he had a telephone conversation with Boesky on Oct.
16, 1985, the night before Gulf &amp; Western bought back all 6.7
million of Boesky's and Icahn's shares in the company.
   He said that during that conversation, Boesky reiterated his
buyback offer of $45 per share, but that Davis rejected it because
the stock closed that day at just above $44.
   The buyback took place on Oct. 17, when the price of the shares
rose to $45, Davis said.
   Prosecutors claim Mulheren aided Boesky in boosting the price of
the stock by purchasing 75,000 shares on Oct. 17.
   Davis also testified that Mulheren, at an Oct. 3, 1985, meeting,
offered help in monitoring Boesky's activities in connection with
Gulf &amp; Western.
   Davis said he made some uncomplimentary statements about Boesky
and that Mulheren ``certainly didn't disagree.''
   In a later telephone conversation that took place before the
buyback, Davis said Mulheren told him he didn't believe Boesky owned
any Gulf &amp; Western Securities. Davis said Mulheren never told him
about his own purchase of the Gulf &amp; Western stock.
   In addition to stock manipulation, Mulheren is charged with
concealing ownership of other stocks to help Boesky cheat on taxes
and evade federal securities laws.

   ConAgra Inc. has agreed to buy Beatrice Co.
for $1.34 billion in cash and stock in a deal that puts several of
the nation's leading food brands on the same corporate shelf, the
two companies announced Thursday.
   ``This is a major league acquisition,'' said Stephen Carnes, an
analyst with Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood in Minneapolis.
   The deal completes the divestiture of Beatrice by the investment
firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which bought the company _ then
a huge foods and consumer products conglomerate _ in a $6.1 billion
leveraged buyout in 1986.
   Since then, Beatrice has sold off most of its businesses but
still retains such well-known food brands as Hunt's, Wesson,
Manwich, Peter Pan, Snack Pak, Swiss Miss, La Choy, Swift Premium,
Butterball, Eckrich, and Reddi-Wip.
   ConAgra, an Omaha-based company with annual sales of more than
$15 billion, has a stable of brand names in the frozen food market
as well as selling unbranded products such as animal feed and
fertilizer.
   ``This is clearly a major strategic opportunity for ConAgra,''
said Charles M. Harper, ConAgra chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``One of ConAgra's most important long-term objectives has been
to establish a strong sales and distribution system to the
shelf-stable section of the grocery store,'' he said. ``Beatrice
will fulfill that objective.''
   Expansion-minded ConAgra last year lost a bidding war for poultry
processor Holly Farms Corp., which was acquired by Tyson Foods Inc.
in a $1.4 billion deal. ConAgra did pocket $50 million in
termination fees and other expenses.
   The company sells food products under such brands as Healthy
Choice, Banquet, Armour Classics, Morton, Chun King and Kid's
Cuisine frozen foods; Armour processed meats and Country Pride
chicken products.
   Under terms of the ConAgra-Beatrice agreement, ConAgra would buy
Beatrice for $11.50 a share from Kohlberg Kravis partnerships and
management investors. Beatrice would have 123.44 million shares
outstanding assuming the exercise of warrants for its shares.
   The purchase transaction consists of approximately $626 million
in cash, net of warrant proceeds, $355 million in ConAgra common
stock and $355 million in two series of ConAgra preferred stock _ a
total of $1.34 billion, the companies said.
   The deal, which is subject to approval by federal regulators, was
announced after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
where ConAgra's stock rose 75 cents to $32 a share.
   ``We believe Beatrice offers long-term value to ConAgra and our
stockholders,'' Harper said. ``We are also optimistic about
near-term earnings prospects.''
   Henry Kravis, a founding partner of Kohlberg Kravis, ``We are
very excited about the combination of ConAgra Inc. and Beatrice
Company.
   ``Four years ago, together with new management of Beatrice, we
began the process of reshaping Beatrice from a diverse conglomerate
into a focused and more profitable food company,'' he said.
``Today's announcement marks the successful completion of this
process.''
   KKR said investors who put $420 million of equity into the
Beatrice buyout reaped a total of about $2.2 billion from the
selloff of its businesses, representing a compound annual rate of
return of more than 50 percent.
   For the fiscal year ending Feb. 28, Beatrice reported earnings of
$12 million on sales of $4.26 billion. The company reported it had
trimmed its long-term debt to $987 million from $1.252 billion a
year earlier.
   ConAgra had sales in excess of $15 billion for the fiscal year
that ended May 27. Its earnings statement is expected to be released
later this month.
   Beatrice was one of the nation's biggest food and consumer
products conglomerates, owning product lines that included Coca-Cola
bottlers, Hunt-Wesson foods, Swift-Eckrich meats, Stiffel lamps,
Samsonite luggage, Tropicana juices, Max Factor cosmetics and the
Avis car rental agency.
   The 1986 buyout led by Kohlberg Kravis at the time was the
biggest leveraged buyout ever, and one of the largest non-oil
company takeovers of all time.
   After the deal, Beatrice began selling most of its businesses to
pay off the buyout debt and generate a return for investors who put
up money for the deal.
   Avis was sold to a group led by its employees; Tropicana to
Seagram Co. Ltd.; Beatrice's international food businesses to the
investment firm TLC International; and a score of other companies to
a group led by former Beatrice Chairman Donald P. Kelly.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hitachi Ltd., a leading Japanese electric machinery
maker, said it has produced the first prototype of a 64-megabit
memory chip.
   The company said the development of the dynamic random access
memory chip puts it in the lead in the race to produce future
generations of memory chips, which are used in products ranging from
computers to compact disc players.
   The tiny circuits etched in the semiconductor chip are only 0.3
microns, or millionths of a meter, wide. The chip can hold about 64
million binary units of information, enough to hold the equivalent
of 512 English newspaper pages or one hour of music recorded on
compact discs, Hitachi spokesman Takafumi Ichinose said Thursday.
   ``That should lead to the development of a variety of new
products,'' he said.
   Hitachi expects to begin marketing the chip in 1995, he said.
Each generation of memory chips is generally replaced by a new
generation with four times as much capacity every three years.
   The most advanced DRAM chips currently being marketed have a
capacity of four megabits.

   Defendants in the securities case against American
Continental Corp. and its Lincoln Savings and Loan unit have until
next April 1 to decide if they will testify at the trial, a federal
judge ruled Thursday.
   The ruling came despite the protests of a lawyer for New York
financier Michael R. Milken, who claimed Milken's own legal
situation would make it impossible for him to decide whether to
testify in that time frame.
   U.S. District Judge Richard M. Bilby, chief judge for the Arizona
District, also set a Sept. 30, 1991, trial date and said he would
hear the case in Tucson.
   The judge disposed of a series of motions, heard an update on the
case's 32 million-document depository, and ordered an attorney for
the federal Office of Thrift Supervision to ferret out OTS employees
who may have abused attorney-client privilege in denying documents
to American Continental lawyers.
   American Continental, which bought Lincoln in February 1984,
triggered a rash of suits and countersuits when it filed for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of federal Bankruptcy Code on April
13, 1989. The next day, the forerunner of the OTS took control of
Lincoln.
   Not long after, about 23,000 investors claimed that officers of
the holding company or Lincoln misled them into buying more than
$200 million in junk bonds by passing them off as sound investments.
   The class action was filed in federal court in Los Angeles. It
has been transferred to Bilby's court and combined with the
bankruptcy filing and a Resolution Trust Corp. racketeering suit
against American Continental chairman Charles Keating Jr. and other
American Continental insiders under the blanket term of Multi
District Litigation.
   In addition, Keating, who has maintained that federal regulators
caused the $2 billion Lincoln failure by taking over a healthy
thrift, has filed two suits in U.S. District Court in Washington.
One seeks to set aside the conservatorship of Lincoln; the other is
a $300 million personal-damages suit against federal officials.
   Bilby said he would investigate the allegation of Michael
Kennedy, an American Continental attorney, that the OTS had withheld
documents that the company needs in its suit by claiming the files
were privileged.
   Kennedy said non-lawyers, who do not have the right to claim a
professional privilege, have classified the documents as privileged.
   ``I want you to tell me, sooner rather than later, who did it,''
Bilby told OTS attorney Donald Wall.
   Bilby set an April 1 deadline for defendants to decide if they
will invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination. He said anyone indicted from now until
mid-February would have 45 days after indictment to make the same
decision.
   Milken is a defendant in the class-action suit through his
defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert investment-banking firm, which
underwrote many of American Continental's and Lincoln's securities.
   Milken pleaded guilty in April to six felony counts and paid a
record $600 million fine. He is to be sentenced Oct. 1.
   Because of his legal problems, Milken is not in a position to
meet the April 1 deadline to decide if he will testify at the trial,
argued David L. Kornblau, a New York lawyer for Milken.
   Kornblau also argued that Milken was a peripheral figure in the
Keating case, prompting Bilby to quip, ``If he has such a small part
in this case, this (decision) can't be any problem.''

   Motorola Inc. has signed a $5 million contract to
provide cellular telephones to Hungary, the company said.
   Motorola said Wednesday the deal makes it the first company to
supply mobile phones in Eastern Europe.
   Motorola's British subsidiary said it would deliver the phone
equipment over the next two years to Hungarian Radiotelephone Ltd.,
a joint venture between Hungarian Telecommunications, previously
Magyar Posta, and U S West International.
   The joint venture currently is installing a cellular network in
Hungary.

<HEAD>Japan Reportedly Chooses Motorola Design for New Cellular System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Japanese government has chosen American
technology as the technical standard for a new generation of digital
cellular telephones, a newspaper reported.
   The decision, made Wednesday but due to be announced formally on
Thursday, may make it easier for American companies to supply
equipment in Japan, The New York Times said in an early edition of
Thursday's paper. Current Japanese equipment isn't compatible with
U.S. equipment, the newspaper said.
   Japan's Ministry of Post and Telecommunications selected a key
digital cellular phone component designed by Motorola Inc., the
company's vice president for digital product operations, Morton
Stern, was quoted as saying.
   Motorola was selected in a close contest over competing designs
offered by Japanese, European and American companies, a Japanese
embassy official in Washington, who asked not to be identified, was
quoted as saying.
   Although Motorola's standard was chosen, the design must be
published and licensed to other companies free of charge under
Japan's rules of competition, the newspaper said.
   The equipment will be used to convert Japan's cellular telephone
system from analog transmission to digital transmission, which is
capable of carrying a greater number of calls.
