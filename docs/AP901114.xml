<HEAD>New Governor Not Alarmed At Budget Deficit</HEAD>

   Gov.-elect Lowell P. Weicker Jr. said
Wednesday Connecticut's budget problems may get worse and he is
weighing all options, including tax increases, to deal with a $2.1
billion shortfall.
   ``I'll have to study it,'' said Weicker, a former three-term
U.S. senator.
   ``We'll get whatever job has to be done, done,'' Weicker said.
``I think it's clear to anybody that sacrifice is going to be
required in some form and I don't want to go ahead and state what
the sacrifice is going to be until I understand the full dimensions
of the problems.''
   The $2.1 billion gap between spending necessary to maintain
current services and income from existing taxes represents 30
percent of the current $7.05 billion budget.
   Retiring Gov. William A. O'Neill, who decided not to seek
re-election this year, had said he could not see how the next
governor could balance the budget without raising taxes. He
reiterated that stance after a meeting with Weicker Wednesday.
   ``I think that's going to be very difficult if not impossible,''
O'Neill said of avoiding tax increases.
   Weicker was to be provided budget details Thursday. State law
requires that the governor present a balance budget each year and
the Legislature approve a balanced spending plan.
   Weicker said he was ``not taken aback'' by the size of the
deficit estimate.
   ``The recession we're in has accelerated at a rate far exceeding
any predictions,'' he said. ``It could very well get even worse.''
   Weicker will be inaugurated Jan. 9.

<HEAD>Arts Endowment Panelists Resign to Protest `Decency' Standard</HEAD>

   Nine members of a literary panel of the
National Endowment for the Arts resigned to protest a new
congressional edict that federally subsidized works must meet
``general standards of decency.''
   ``We deplore the implied threat of censure and attempt to
constrict freedom of artistic expression and the rights grantd by
the First Amendment,'' they wrote in a joint letter Monday to NEA
Chairman John E. Frohnmayer.
   The nine resigned from an 11-member NEA panel of outside experts
that judges grant applications from small, independent presses,
literary magazines and non-profit organizations that distribute
contemporary literary works.
   Last year, on the basis of the literary publishing panel's
recommendations, Frohnmayer approved 99 grants totaling $1.4
million.
   Frohnmayer said resignations were ``premature'' and
``unfortunate.'' He predicted the endowment would find a way to
implement the new law in good faith without stifling artistic
creativity.
   The protest seemed largely symbolic. NEA spokesman Josh Dare
said the panel was effectively dissolved when it completed its work
on 1989-90 grant proposals last December. A new panel - minus the
nine protesters - will convene Nov. 26 to review next year's
grants.
   The nine said they resigned over a new congressional requirement
that the NEA chairman ``shall ensure'' that grants are made
``taking into consideration general standards of decency and
respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American
public.''
   Congress tacked those restrictions onto the endowment's current
$174 million budget shortly before it adjourned Oct. 28. The curbs
replaced a much stricter obscenity ban that covered NEA grants last
year.
   This year, Congress said only that obscenity ``shall not be
funded'' by the NEA and that obscenity judgments should be left to
the courts.
   Even though the new curbs are milder than the former ban, they
nevertheless set ``a very scary precedent,'' said Jennifer Moyer,
former chairwoman of the NEA's literary publishing panel. ``If
there are any restrictions on freedom of expression, it's
unacceptable.''
   Ms. Moyer, a poet and literary publisher from Mt. Kisco, N.Y.,
resigned along with eight others representing writers, editors,
publishers, booksellers and arts administrators on the panel.
   In a separate letter informing Frohnmayer of her resignation,
panelist Helaine Harris, a bookseller from Hyattsville, Md., asked
how the endowment can distinguish between ``decent or indecent
art'' under the new law.
   ``I feel that I can be a judge of artistic merit, but I don't
feel that I should pass judgment on decency,'' she wrote. ``I
refuse to be a part of this self-censorship process.''
   The other panelists who resigned were Michael Anania, a poet,
fiction writer and teacher from Chicago; Denise Chavez, a Houston
writer; Katharine Harer of Berkeley, Calif., director of a
distributing company for small literary presses; Brooks Haxton, a
poet and teacher from White Plains, N.Y.; poet Susan Howe of
Guilford, Conn.; Peter Meinke, a writer and director of a literary
workshop at Eckard College in St. Petersburg, Fla.; and E.
Ethelbert Miller, a poet and teacher at Howard University in
Washington D.C.
   The two panelists who did not resign were Anne Bourget of the
California Arts Council in Sacramento and Beverly Jarrett, editor
in chief of the University of Missouri Press at Columbia, Mo.
   Ms. Jarrett, who will serve on the newly formed literary
publishing panel, said she refused to resign because it ``seemed
like throwing the baby out with the bath water'' at a time when the
NEA deserves support for helping the arts survive.
   Ms. Bourget did not return repeated telephone calls seeking her
comment.

<HEAD>National Geographic Unveils Massive New Atlas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``If you don't know where you are, you're
nowhere.''
   That's the word from National Geographic Society President
Gilbert M. Grosvenor who unveiled a massive new book Tuesday that
shows where everywhere is.
   The $18 million, 405-page, sixth National Geographic Atlas
arrives in a world undergoing change.
   And that change made compiling the new book exciting, confusing,
taxing and costly, say its editors.
   ``Producing this new atlas was like covering a breaking news
story ... It's been a scramble,'' said William Graves, editor of
National Geographic magazine.
   Changes such as the merger of East and West Germany and North
and South Yemen - and the potential for other changes - nearly
delayed publication and resulted in some unexpected costs.
   For example, on Sept. 21 the German embassy called to inform the
society that the new united Germany had chosen Berlin as its sole
capital. That call cost the Geographic $100,000.
   Officials thought they had taken every precaution. They printed
all the physical maps first, then the less controversial political
maps.
   Germany, in the process of merging two nations into one, was
left for last. But finally the Geographic had to go ahead.
   The editors took a chance and designated two capitals: Bonn and
Berlin. But the Germans outfoxed them by choosing to have just one.
   The presses ground to a halt. The map of Germany and some of the
text was changed.
   And on Tuesday, when the society unveiled the result, its newest
world atlas showed only Berlin as the German capital.
   Wary of further potential changes, in the Soviet Union for
example, Grosvenor said buyers of the $74.95 book will be entitled
to two updates over the next three years. Those would be
supplements, but Grosvenor said the exact form they take will
depend on what changes they reflect.
   In addition to the traditional maps, the new volume has a number
of satellite images, including an unusual world map showing all
land areas virtually cloud-free.
   That map was compiled from thousands of pictures collected over
several years by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
satellites. Then the best cloud-free images of each part of the
world were pieced together to form a giant world mosaic.
   ``It's an image of the Earth as we've never seen it before,''
said Grosvenor.

<HEAD>Latest Postal Contract Offer Divisive, Union Leader Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service is trying to ``pit worker
against worker'' by offering cash bonuses but no hourly wage
increases, the president of the largest postal union contends.
   ``It's just a massage piece designed to divide us,'' Moe Biller,
president of the American Postal Workers Union, said Tuesday as
thousands of unionized postal employees held a rally at a
Washington hotel.
   The Postal Service and its four largest unions, which together
represent 660,000 workers, are in the midst of negotiations to
replace contracts that expire Nov. 20.
   Biller called management's latest offer, which has not been
publicly outlined by the Postal Service, ``a piece of garbage
designed to pit worker against worker.''
   Postal Service spokesman Michael West said: ``We have negotiated
at the table and not in the press. ... At least for now, we prefer
to leave the specifics on the table.''
   Biller said management had offered the 234,000-member National
Association of Letter Carriers a separate pay incentive plan aimed
at dividing the two unions, which bargain together although for
separate contracts. Biller's union represents 334,000 postal
clerks, maintenance employees, drivers and special delivery
messengers.
   Assistant Postmaster General David Charters said the
pay-incentive plan was part of the Postal Service's goal of holding
the rate of postage increases below the rate of inflation.
   ``We think incentives to support (that) plan are in order,''
Charters said.
   Because the agency, no longer subsidized by taxpayers, must
break even over time, its board of governors has proposed raising
the cost of mailing a letter from 25 cents to 30 cents next spring.
   The unions have not made a counter offer. Biller declined to say
how big a pay increases the unions were proposing or when the
proposals would be presented. Letter carriers and clerks now
receive a starting salary of around $24,000 and can earn a maximum
of about $31,500. Employees receive an additional $8,560 in
benefits and premium pay.
   Tuesday's ``solidarity rally,'' attended by both letter carriers
and clerks, was aimed at showing the Postal Service that the two
unions would stand together, Biller said.
   Two other unions also negotiating with the Postal Service are
the National Postal Mail Handlers Union, which represents 50,000
mail handlers, and the National Rural Letter Carriers Association,
with about 42,000 members.
   Biller said little progress had been made since the talks began
in August. He said he was not optimistic that a deal could be
struck by next week.
   ``Right now, I don't see anything on the horizon,'' he said.
   But Postal Service officials ``still have hope that an agreement
will be reached by deadline,'' West said.
   Under federal law, it is illegl for postal workers to strike.
If a contract isn't reached by midnight Nov. 20, both sides could
extend the current contract to give themselves more time to settle
the dispute.

   Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood was hit by a
vehicle and broke his legs while directing traffic around an
accident involving his car.
   Wood, 43, spent the night in Princess Margaret Hospital in
Swindon after the accident Monday. On Tuesday he said he was ``fine
and dandy.''
   After Wood's wife crashed the family car west of London, the
guitarist stepped out to direct traffic and was struck by another
vehicle, police said. Police gave no cause for the crash of the
Woods' car.
   Jo Wood and the couple's children Leah, 12, and Tyrone, 7,
suffered minor injuries, police said.

   PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) - Sonny Bono says he is exploring a
run for U.S. Senate.
   The pop singer-turned-mayor of this desert community said
Tuesday he is contemplating a run in 1992 for the seat held by
Democrat Alan Cranston. Cranston, who is battling prostate cancer,
has said he won't run again.
   Bono, a Republican, was the ``I Got You, Babe'' teenybopper idol
of the '60s and the butt of former wife Cher's gibes on their TV
show in the '70s.
   ``I'm sure there's going to be some staunch Republican
conservatives who ... may view me as a rock 'n' roller,'' Bono
said. ``I'm going to have some things to confront that may be
difficult from an image viewpoint.
   ``Hopefully, we can flip the coin on that.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Linda Ellerbee, who left NBC in 1986 after it
canceled her ``NBC News Overnight,'' may return in a daytime
information series.
   She has taped a pilot for the show, she said Tuesday. She

   After leaving NBC, she was co-anchor of ABC News' ``Our World.''
The show was dropped after one season.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Delta Burke is again accusing the producers
of ``Designing Women'' of picking on her.
   In an interview with Barbara Walters to be broadcast on ABC
tonight, a tearful Miss Burke reopened the feud with Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason and husband Harry Thomason that flared over the
summer.
   Miss Burke said the producers of the CBS series were upset with
her weight gain and threatened to replace her as the shallow,
sharp-tongued Suzanne Sugarbaker.
   ``I do not want to be squashed down on the floor like I don't
matter, or have no brains and nothing I say means anything,'' she
said.
   The Thomasons did not respond to repeated calls Tuesday but
denied Miss Burke's allegations of mistreatment earlier this year.
   Despite the furor, Miss Burke said she wants to stay on the
show.
   ``I would like it to work better with everyone, but I have to be
recognized and I have to be acknowledged,'' she said.

   NEW YORK (AP) - President Bush, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter,
Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon will be among recipients of the Ellis
Island Medal of Honor.
   The medals honoring representatives from various ethnic
backgrounds will be presented Dec. 9 at Ellis Island in New York
Harbor.
   The winners are selected by the National Ethnic Coalition of
Organizations. The medals were last awarded in 1986.
   Other recipients announced Tuesday included Frank Sinatra,
songwriter Paul Simon, former congresswoman Barbara Jordan,
Cincinnati Reds manager Lou Pinella and sportscaster Phil Rizzuto.

   HOUSTON (AP) - Paul McCartney's birth certificate is for sale
and could fetch $20,000, the auctioneer says.
   Auction house owner Ray Simpson said Tuesday he examined the
paper, stamps and certification language and concluded it's the
real thing. The birth certificate was sold to an American investor
by the former Beatle's stepmother, he said.
   ``I have no doubt about it at all. It is absolutely
unconditionally guaranteed,'' he said.
   The certificate shows that on June 18, 1942, at 107 Rice Lane,
James Paul McCartney was born to James McCartney, a ``centre lathe
turner (aircraft factory),'' and Mary Patricia McCartney of 10
Sunbury Road, Liverpool.

   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Little Richard says he'd like Michael
Jackson to play him in the movies. Eddie Murphy, he says, isn't
good looking enough.
   The 57-year-old piano-pounding rock 'n' roller will be in
Atlantic City on Saturday for a one-time appearance at Trump Taj
Mahal.
   He said he is looking for a record deal and negotiating to
create a syndicated variety show. He also is planning an
autobiographical movie.
   ``I want to see Michael Jackson as me,'' he said. ``There was
talk that Eddie Murphy would do it, but I think he would talk too
nasty, say things that don't need to be said. And he's not good
looking enough to be Little Richard.''
   Little Richard, whose hits include ``Long Tall Sally,'' ``Tutti
Frutti,'' and ``Lucille,'' doesn't jump around the stage as he once
did, nor does he indulge in the drugs, liquor and frequent sex with
both men and women that twice led him to leave rock 'n' roll for
gospel, in 1959 and in the mid-1970s.
   ``I think everything is under control at this age,'' he said in
a telephone interview. ``We don't have to pay tolls, we just sing
with a lot of soul, but we are still bold. ''

<HEAD>Panel Recommends Splitting Budget Office Due to HUD Failures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House and Congress share blame for
allowing scandal and mismanagement to go unchecked at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Reagan
administration, a Senate panel concludes.
   In a report Tuesday, the investigative panel recommended a
series of reforms, including splitting up the White House's Office
of Management and Budget to create a separate office to monitor
management of federal agencies.
   ``HUD mismanaged programs either because it opposed the program
itself ... or because it lacked the capacity or leadership to
operate them free from abuse,'' the investigative subcommittee of
the Senate Banking Committee said. ``Unfortunately, the various
parties responsible for oversight were all negligent, including HUD
itself, OMB and the Congress.''
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., chairman of the panel appointed to
handle the Senate's inquiry into the $2 billion HUD scandals, said
the White House budget office under President Reagan gave little
scrutiny to required management reports and acted on none.
   ``There's a need for more emphasis on the management side of
OMB,'' Graham said in an interview. ``OMB has become essentially a
budget office. ... They completely collapsed. They became a filing
agency - not hardly reading and certainly not acting on the
reports.''
   ``Almost every safety net ripped and let HUD crash to the
ground,'' he said.
   The report blamed Samuel Pierce, HUD secretary for all eight
years of Reagan's term, for a hands-off management that fostered
abuse. It blamed Congress for ignoring warnings of management
problems and for holding no oversight hearings on the troubled
department.
   It said the Senate failed in its confirmation responsibilities
by allowing the Reagan administration to fill the agency's top
ranks with political appointees who had little interest in housing.
Only two people nominated for HUD positions during the 1980s failed
to gain confirmation, it said.
   The panel recommended creation of a federal advisory panel to
evaluate future HUD political appointees and report to the Senate
on their worthiness. Graham compared it to the American Bar
Association's review of judicial nominees, which the Senate
considers before confirming judges and justices.
   The Senate panel focused on structural flaws that permitted the
scandals. A separate House investigation focused on personalities
in the scandal and received far more public notice.
   Most of the subcommittee's findings were approved unanimously.
The ranking Republican, Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., disagreed on
splitting OMB. He also opposed creating the confirmation advisory
board and the panel's recommendation that HUD's staffing be
increased.
   Graham said he would sponsor bills to implement the report.
Congress created the White House budget office and could change it
by law, or the president could take executive action on his own, he
said.
   Among the panel's other recommendations:
   -HUD's assistant secretary for administration should be a career
employee, not a political appointee. HUD should report to Congress
on other positions that should be reserved for career staff.
   -Senate hearings should be held to receive each report of the
HUD inspector general, the secretary's semiannual report and other
required HUD management reports.
   -HUD should increase its monitoring of subsidy programs to
eliminate excess subsidies for specific projects, which were
revealed in the HUD scandals. It should overhaul its calculation of
fair market rents.
   Graham said he concluded the HUD scandals were in part due to a
deliberate effort by the Reagan administration to fill the agency
with people who weren't competent and had antipathy for the
department's mission, resulting in failure and discredit falling
upon housing programs.
   The panel did not allege illegality, but Graham said he believed
there ``may be some examples of perjury'' in reports Pierce made to
the president and Congress on management capability as required by
law.
   The report cited a 1987 HUD document stating that its financial
management controls were adequate. ``At the same time,'' the report
said, ``HUD management knew that serious problems existed with
HUD's accounting systems'' and that the Federal Housing
Administration's accounting systems failed to meet accepted
standards and were deemed unauditable.
   Pierce, who is under investigation by the special prosecutor,
has denied any wrongdoing.

   A former civilian clerk at the Quantico
Marine Base will be sentenced Jan. 9 for killing a Marine corporal
in an attempt to hide her role in an alleged embezzlement scheme
involving the helicopter squadron that serves President Bush.
   Markeithia R. Reeves, 24, of Suitland, Md., on Tuesday entered a
so-called Alford plea, in which a defendant does not admit guilt
but acknowledges that the state has enough evidence to convict. She
faces a maximum sentence of 20 years to life in prison.
   The plea was accepted just before Reeves was to begin her
first-degree murder trial in the death of Cpl. Estella Pearson.
   Pearson, 26, a Quantico clerk whose responsibilities included
reviewing travel vouchers, was found shot to death March 5 in her
car in a shopping center parking lot.
   A second defendant, Tania T. Morton, 23, of Arlington, Va., a
former Navy civilian clerk, is scheduled to go on trial Tuesday.
   Following Reeves' plea in Prince William County Circuit Court,
prosecutors called two witnesses to the stand to substantiate the
case against her.
   According to testimony, Pearson was killed shortly after it
became apparent that travel vouchers were being falsified involving
members of the Quantico-based Helicopter Squadron One, which
transports the president and other government officials.
   Secret Service agent Robert Turner testified that 44 U.S.
Treasury checks totaling $33,000 with endorsements that had been
forged had been traced to Reeves and Morton.
   Reeves worked in the same department as Pearson and was
responsible for preparing travel vouchers for employees going on
temporary assignments.
   Turner said Pearson's supervisor asked her to verify several
suspicious travel vouchers. ``Markeithia saw this,'' the agent told
The Washington Post outside the courtroom. ``Then she started to
realize they had caught on.''

   A Senate employee had a warning for Paul
Wellstone when he walked into the Capitol for the first time since
unseating Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.
   ``Senator, this place changes people,'' the worker told him.
   ``Remind me some time, if I'm changing,'' Wellstone replied.
   Wellstone, who has never held public office, arrived for two
days of orientation sessions Tuesday, intending to live up to his
advance billing as an aggressive, articulate spokesman for liberal
causes.
   ``He didn't seem to be intimidated at all,'' Sen. Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., said after an organizational meeting that was the first
chance for many senators to see and hear Wellstone.
   ``I'm going to roll up my sleeves,'' Wellstone said. ``I'm very
serious about public policy. I also have a mandate to be outspoken.
That's the way I am. I want to enjoy myself here. I don't want to
change.''
   Wellstone, the lone Democrat in the 1990 class, was the only
Senate candidate in the country this year to defeat an incumbent.
The other senators-elect - Republican Reps. Hank Brown of Colorado,
Larry Craig of Idaho and Robert Smith of New Hampshire - won open
seats.
   Wellstone is a short, balding 46-year-old, a former state
campaign manager for Jesse Jackson and a political science
professor on leave from Carleton College in Northfield, Minn.
   Boschwitz aides dismissed him as an ``Abbie Hoffman-type
character'' and the incumbent outspent him 7-1 in the campaign.
   But Wellstone crisscrossed the state in a rickety converted
school bus and captivated Minnesotans with his high-energy style,
self-deprecating humor and infectious enthusiasm.
   He also drew attention for a series of offbeat TV ads that
exploited his underdog status. One was a breakneck parody of a
candidate's day in which he said he had to talk fast because he had
little money. Another followed the frustrated Wellstone trying to
find Boschwitz at offices all over.
   He called for national health insurance, universal health care,
deep cuts in military spending and big increases in education and
nutrition aid.
   ``Because of the deficit we've built up, the kind of agenda I
believe in, which is kind of a human capital-people agenda, can't
happen right away,'' he said Tuesday.
   Wellstone, however, can't wait forever. His promised after the
Nov. 6 election to serve only two terms.
   ``I think I can make a difference,'' he said. ``I really believe
there will be big changes in our country in the '90s. I think that
people are ready for change. If that's the case I'll be a strong
force for it.''
   Wellstone introduced himself at the Democratic Senate caucus
Tuesday.
   ``He talked about how he hopes the Democrats will stand up for
the things they believe in,'' said Daschle. ``I think he's going to
be a welcome addition to the caucus.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Wellstone
``will be a valuable, productive and contributing member of the
Senate and will represent the people of his state fairly and
effectively and vigorously.''
   But first, more mundane matters beckoned, such as getting into
the Capitol, bidding for committee assignments and learning who
people are.
   ``What I'm most nervous about is that I hope everybody has name
tags,'' Wellstone said. ``Otherwise I'm going to go up to somebody
who I should know and say, what is your name? And it turns out to
be the Senate majority leader or something like that.''

   In a tiny seaside village, police on
Wednesday fatally wounded a gunman they said killed at least 11
people in a shooting rampage that was New Zealand's worst massacre,
officials said.
   Police said 33-year-old David Malcolm Gray, who had fled to a
house on the village's northern edge after being driven from his
own, had been shot in the chest and ankle, and also suffered a head
wound.
   At about 5:45 p.m., police lobbed smoke grenades into the house
and stormed it, ending a 21-hour ordeal that wiped out nearly half
the population of the village of Aramoana.
   Black-clad officers, some with ski masks, had stormed Gray's
house nearly two hours earlier but found it empty and began a
search.
   Police originally said Gray was being airlifted by army
helicopter to nearby Dunedin. Later, they said he had died of his
injuries.
   Aramoana, which had a population of 25 before the rampage, is
about 17 miles north of Dunedin in rugged country on New Zealand's
South Island.
   Victims of the massacre included a 6-year-old boy who had rode
his bicycle up to the gunman's house to see what was happening, and
a police sergeant from nearby Port Chalmers whose body was found in
dunes outside of town.
   Bodies lay strewn about outside Gray's house and a neighboring
home that he had set on fire when the rampage began Tuesday night,
said Dunedin police Sgt. Bill O'Brien.
   Police had been unable to check if the victims were still alive
for fear the gunman might open fire. Gray had been holed up inside
his home for much of Wednesday, firing indiscriminately, they said.
   About 140 police, including an anti-terrorism squad, had poured
into remote Aramoana after the shooting began.
   Police spokeswoman Kaye Calder said police found a .22-caliber
rifle, an air rifle and 9mm ammunition inside Gray's home.
   Residents who had been trapped in their homes since the
onslaught began were finally evacuated aboard a navy training
vessel, the HMNZS Moa.
   They had spent a terrifying night huddled on the floors of their
homes as gunfire punctuated the silence.
   The worst previous worst massacre in New Zealand occurred in
1941 when Eric Stanley Graham killed six police officers before
being shot dead.
   The rampage started Tuesday evening when Gray, who apparently
lived alone, set his neighbor's house on fire and began shooting at
firemen and residents who approached to put it out, according to
neighbors.
   O'Brien said police were mystified as to what sparked the
incident.
   ``We don't know why he has done this,'' he said.
   Aramoana is among cliffs and sandy marshes in an isolated area
across Otago Harbor from Taiaroa Head, a famous albatross colony
that attracts birders from around the world.
   Dorothy Crimp, 74, who lives across from Gray's house, described
him as ``a very quiet chap, a real loner.''
   ``I have met him on the beach - he never spoke to anyone.''

   The U.S. troop buildup in the Persian Gulf
poses a ``difficult legal question,'' says a federal judge in
refusing to bar the Army from sending a reservist to Saudi Arabia
without a formal declaration of war.
   U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth rejected a bid Tuesday by
Army National Guard Sgt. Michael R. Ange for a temporary
restraining order to stop his deployment to the Persian Gulf.
   ``If I gave your soldier a TRO, I would have a few others in
here tomorrow,'' Lamberth told Ange's lawyer, Michael Ratner. The
judge scheduled a Dec. 10 hearing on Ange's request for a permanent
injunction.
   The case ``does pose a difficult legal question'' about
President Bush's power to send troops to a combat zone without a
congressional declaration of war, the judge said.
   Ange's lawsuit was filed as two key Republican lawmakers, Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and Richard Lugar of Indiana,
former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, urged Bush to
seek congressional authorization for the U.S. military mission in
the Middle East.
   Ange contends that Bush has not gotten the authorization from
Congress that is required by the Constitution. Ratner, an attorney
for the Center for Constitutional Rights, also argued that the
order to deploy Ange violates the 1973 War Powers Act.
   ``There has not been sufficient congressional consent, or any
consent, to the military activities at issue,'' Ratner argued.
   The Constitution makes the president commander-in-chief of the
armed forces, including National Guard troops called into federal
service, and gives Congress the power to declare war.
   The War Powers Act requires the president to notify Congress of
any substantial new deployment of forces overseas, and requires him
to win congressional approval or withdraw troops within 60 days if
he sends them into combat or into situations where hostilities are
imminent.
   Ratner said the buildup of 230,000 U.S. troops in the Middle
East - plus Bush's order to send up to another 200,000 - creates
the likelihood of war, which must be declared by Congress.
   ``How does a court decide that hostilities are imminent?''
Lamberth asked. ``The record here is nothing has happened since
August, except a few minor incidents.''
   Ratner said the suit also seeks Ange's return from the Middle
East if he is sent there, the lawyer said.
   Ange is a former Beaufort County, N.C., police officer now
studying criminal justice at Appalachian State University in Boone,
N.C. He was ordered to active duty Oct. 10 with other members of
the 1450th Transportation Company.
   ``When we volunteered we swore to defend our country and our
constitution,'' Ange told reporters at Fort Lee, Va. ``We did not
swear or agree to fight ... to defend economic interests of major
oil companies.''
   At Tuesday's court hearing, Justice Department attorney John
Tyler urged Lamberth to stay out of the growing political dispute
between Congress and the president.
   ``Congress is not without power. This is a political debate. It
belongs in the political arena,'' Tyler said.
   Courts have been extremely reluctant, on the grounds they lack
jurisdiction, to uphold lawsuits challenging troop deployments.

   A nickel will get you a loaf of bread this
week in North Dakota, where farmers are demonstrating against wheat
prices they say are forcing them out of business.
   Members of North Dakota's Farmers Union are selling 5-cent
loaves in every county, usually outside the courthouse where farm
foreclosures take place.
   Some customers are needy and come to buy bargain bread. But most
just want to show they support the farmers.
   ``It appears the crisis in agriculture is getting to be a pretty
severe problem, and as a banker I see more severe problems in the
future if they don't get their point across,'' said James Helgeson,
who was among the customers Tuesday.
   Wheat prices have plummeted because of a worldwide glut.
   A nickel is roughly the price farmers get for the wheat in a
1{-pound loaf of white bread that sells for $1 to $1.25 in stores,
farmers say. They receive slightly more than $2 per bushel for that
wheat - about $1 less than last year and the lowest price in nearly
five years.
   To dramatize the problem, the farmers are selling store-bought
loaves by the score.
   ``We're discovering that there are some really hungry people in
our major cities,'' said Karl Limvere, a Farmers Union spokesman.
``It shows the irony, that farmers can't make any money from their
production and yet we have hungry people.''
   In Benson County, the farmers bought 100 loaves from the rural
county's only bakery and sold them under gray skies that some
called ``foreclosure weather.''
   ``I think perhaps it should have served as an eye-opener to a
lot of people, as far as the disparity of prices,'' said James
Wang, a county state's attorney who bought a loaf.
   Farmers took a blow under the new farm bill sent to President
Bush, which cuts $13.6 billion from farm programs.
   The Farmers Union wants price guarantees for family farmers and
an increase in the amount farmers can borrow from the government to
pay their bills.
   Albert Maruggi, a U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesman in
Washington, said Tuesday, ``We're doing what we can to continue to
push U.S. wheat sales.'' He said USDA has favored a market-based
policy that promotes wheat exports.
   Gov. George Sinner proclaimed this Farm Income-Rural Crisis
Awareness Week.
   The state has struggled through drought the past three years and
has lost 6,500 farmers in the past 10, he said. ``In North Dakota,
net farm income has fallen by 60 percent during the past decade,''
the governor said.
   Farmers reeled off other statistics: In 1980, 172 bushels of
wheat paid for a refrigerator that cost $809. Ten years later, they
said, the cost of that refrigerator has dropped to $712, but 282
bushels are needed to pay for it.

   Hundreds of American communities get drinking
water from wells that contain unhealthy levels of pesticides and
nitrates, the Environmental Protection Agency says.
   A survey of 1,347 wells in 50 states indicates that fewer than 1
percent are contaminated from pesticides to levels that are of
concern, the EPA said Tuesday. About 2.5 percent of the wells have
nitrate levels considered worrisome, the agency said.
   Nevertheless, those wells provide drinking water for millions of
people, EPA officials said.
   While the ``vast majority'' of the country's drinking water
wells don't pose a risk to public health, the findings provide an
``early warning sign that this needs to be taken seriously,'' said
Henry Habicht, the EPA's deputy administrator.
   Environmentalists cited the survey as further proof that the
nation's groundwater is being contaminated by chemical runoffs from
agriculture and other sources. Nitrates come largely from
fertilizer and sewage.
   Ron Phillips, a spokesman for the Fertilizer Institute, said the
survey confirms that ``at least 96 percent of our groundwater is
perfectly safe.'' He disputed that the levels of nitrates found in
some of the well water should be of concern.
   The EPA survey covered both private wells and wells that feed
community water systems.
   From the results of the survey, the agency estimated that about
10.4 percent of all community wells nationwide and 4.2 percent of
private wells likely contain at least some pesticides. The survey
also indicated that more than half of the nation's wells have water
contaminated with nitrates from fertilizer, sewage sludge or septic
tanks.
   Although in most cases the contamination was at levels too low
to be a health concern, the EPA said as many as 750 community water
systems may have wells that have pesticide or nitrate contamination
exceeding federal health guidelines. It estimated that nearly
80,000 private wells in rural areas also likely have unhealthy
levels of contamination.
   Many of the pesticides found in the drinking water are suspected
of causing cancer or damage to vital organs if consumed at
significant levels over a long period. High levels of exposure to
nitrates can cause ``blue baby'' syndrome in very young infants as
well as other illnesses.
   ``The EPA survey reinforces existing strong evidence that
nitrates are contaminating groundwater,'' said Justin Ward of the
Natural Resources Defense Council, a Washington-based environmental
group.
   The NRDC and other environmentalists, however, said the EPA
findings may understate the seriousness of the problem in some
regions of the country where pesticides and nitrogen fertilizers
are heavily used.
   They criticized the EPA's use of national contamination
estimates that include parts of the country where there are few
pesticides or nitrates to contaminate wells.
   The EPA's Habicht said there likely are regional ``hot spots''
where a significantly higher percentage of wells are contaminated.
He said the EPA planned to further examine the overall findings to
focus on regional problem areas. The agency provided no estimates
on water contamination by regions or states.
   The community water systems included in the survey ranged from
those that provide drinking water to very small towns to others
that serve densely populated urban areas, including mid-size and
large cities.
   Many of the country's largest cities rely on surface water for
drinking rather than groundwater from wells.
   The two most frequently detected pesticides found in the well
water were dacthal, a broadleaf weed killer used primarily on
lawns; and atrazine, a widely used weed killer used in agriculture,
especially on corn and sorghum, the EPA said.
   Dacthal and nine other pesticides were found at low levels not
considered a health threat. But atrazine and five other pesticides,
including some that have been banned by the EPA, were found at
levels considered a health concern.

   Restive Republicans elected conservatives to
second-echelon Senate leadership posts in secret balloting that
signaled more combative GOP dealings with majority Democrats in the
next Congress.
   In their organizational caucus Tuesday, the GOP senators
re-elected Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and his chief deputy,
Alan Simpson of Wyoming. But in contests for four second-tier party
leadership posts, conservatives held sway over more moderate
colleagues.
   Dumped from the Republican Party's No3 leadership job was Sen.
John Chafee of Rhode Island, the most liberal Republican in the
Senate. Republicans voted 22-21 to replace him with conservative
Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi.
   Democrats, meanwhile, re-elected Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell of Maine and chose Sen. Wendell Ford of Kentucky to
succeed Alan Cranston of California as assistant majority leader in
a caucus that produced no surprises. Ford had been assured of
election when Sen. David Pryor of Arkansas decided not to challenge
him.
   The move to the right among Republicans held throughout the
closed-door voting on three other open posts in which no incumbents
were seeking new terms.
   Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma defeated Sen. Pete V. Domenici of
New Mexico for the chairmanship of the Republican Policy Committee.
Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas beat out Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky
for the job of campaign chairman. And Sen. Robert Kasten of
Wisconsin was elected secretary of the Republican conference over
Sen. Christopher Bond of Missouri.
   ``I don't think you should read into the election any kind of
statement about ideology or statement that we are tilting one way
or the other,'' Cochran told reporters. ``It may be they just
wanted a change,'' Chafee suggested.
   But Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., who backed Cochran, said, ``It
was just more Republican.''
   This year, Chafee voted to override President Bush's veto of the
civil rights bill, voted against a constitutional amendment to ban
flag burning, voted with liberals on restricting aid to El Salvador
and voted to cut funds for the Strategic Defense Initiative, or
Star Wars.
   The party caucuses came a week after a disappointing GOP
performance in the off-year elections. The party lost a Senate seat
when it had hoped to pick up a couple and position itself to retake
the chamber in 1992. The Democrats picked up a net of nine seats in
the House.
   Many congressional Republicans also were angered when Bush
reversed his no-new-taxes pledge and agreed with Democrats on a
deficit-reduction package that included major new taxes.
   Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar with the private
American Enterprise Institute, said the GOP leadership election was
a signal to Dole and Simpson ``that it's time to get tougher with
the president. They (rank-and-file Republicans) wanted high-energy,
rock-the-boat leaders.''
   He said Chafee and Domenici were ``two extraordinarily
well-liked and well-respected moderates, but they were defeated by
more conservative and more junior upstarts.''
   Conservative fund-raiser Richard Viguerie compared the Senate
elections to the atmosphere that caused Georgia Rep. Newt
Gingrich's rise to House Republican whip two years ago.
   Cochran is a mild-mannered conservative who in 1978 became
Mississippi's first Republican to win election to the Senate since
Reconstruction.
   ``He's like a fire ant,'' said state GOP chairwoman Evelyn
MacPhail. ``He never goes into anything unprepared. He does his
work quietly.''
   Gramm was likely preferred over McConnell because the Texas
senator is more combative and more likely to succeed in
money-raising efforts, GOP officials said.
   The Democrats, who will hold a 56-44 majority in the 102nd
Congress, emerged from their closed-door caucus with a show of
unity. All of the top jobs were filled without contention, Mitchell
said.
   Mitchell, who first won the majority leader's job two years ago
in a spirited three-way race, won his second term by acclamation.
Health care and campaign finance reform are tops on his list of
legislative objectives for the new Congress, he said.
   Cranston, 76, has served since 1977 as the assistant majority
leader, or whip. He announced last week he was stepping down from
the post, and would leave the Senate at the end of the next
Congress, because of prostate cancer.
   Cranston is one of five senators under investigation by the
Senate Ethics Committee for their involvement with former savings
and loan operator Charles F. Keating.

<HEAD>Prospects Uncertain for Regulatory Action on S&amp;L Favoritism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newly released report alleges favoritism in
the government's past handling of some shaky savings and loans, but
regulators haven't decided whether to pursue the matter.
   The document indicates that federal regulators gave preferential
treatment as far back as the mid-1980s to some ailing S&amp;Ls whose
executives sat on a regional regulatory board.
   The report, made public Tuesday at a hearing by the House Budget
Committee's Task Force on Urgent Fiscal Issues, names several S&amp;L
executives who allegedly received favorable treatment from the
Federal Home Loan Bank in Dallas.
   But regulators said they haven't decided if they will take
action against those executives or the federal S&amp;L examiners who
allegedly favored them.
   ``This has come to us off the wall,'' Thomas Mason, a spokesman
for the Office of Thrift Supervision, said of the new revelations.
   Mason said the OTS, the agency that took over S&amp;L regulation
from the Federal Home Loan Bank system, has ``no idea'' at this
point whether it will pursue action against the people involved.
   At the hearing, Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said the
favoritism indicated by a 1988 government review of the Dallas Home
Loan Bank discouraged bank examiners and slowed recognition of the
magnitude of the S&amp;L crisis.
   ``Sirens were sounding in the basement of the (Federal Home Loan
Bank Board) throughout 1988, but the regulators just plugged their
ears,'' said Schumer, who chairs the Budget Committee task force.
   The task force released a summary of the 1988 review of the
Dallas bank board, which was responsible for regulating S&amp;Ls in
Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and New Mexico.
   Like home loan banks in other regions of the country, the Dallas
institution was controlled by S&amp;Ls that it both supervised and
loaned money to.
   The review of the Dallas bank by an outside ``peer review team''
of government examiners indicated that senior federal S&amp;L
regulators knew losses were deliberately concealed by the thrifts
with the approval of local examiners.
   It also found conflicts of interest that resulted in
preferential treatment for some S&amp;L executives who also were
directors of the Dallas bank.
   In one case, local examiners removed an auditor who questioned
the chairman of an Arkansas S&amp;L who was a director of the Dallas
bank, according to the task force document. M.R. Godwin, chairman
of First Federal Savings of Arkansas, had been accused of
defrauding shareholders.
   The Dallas bank board ``had been more interested in helping a
fellow director'' than in removing Godwin from his First Federal
post to protect shareholders, the document said.
   It said preferential treatment also apparently was given to:
Allan D. Myers, chairman of Olney Savings Association and a
director of the Dallas bank; Shelby Smith, a director and former
employee of the Dallas bank; Robert Mettlen, a director of Lamar
Savings Association and a former director of the Dallas bank; and
James Ward, chairman of Commercial Federal Savings Bank of
Louisiana and a director of the Dallas bank.
   The review found that the Dallas bank failed to do financial
examinations of nearly 200 S&amp;Ls in a timely manner. It said the
Dallas regulators delayed taking some supervisory actions and
failed completely to take others.
   It also accused the Dallas bank board of:
   -``Terrible'' monitoring of S&amp;Ls' financial condition.
   -Approving excessive pay and bonuses for S&amp;L executives.
   -Weak supervision and inflated financial ratings of S&amp;Ls in the
face of ``tremendous growth, high-risk lending, poor capital and
insider abuse.''
   -An overly bureaucratic, multilayered decision process that
slowed proper supervision.
   Another spokesman for the Office of Thrift Supervision, William
Fulwider, declined to comment directly on those findings but said
the system has improved greatly since S&amp;L bailout legislation was
enacted last year.
   ``There has been a decided move to improve examination and
supervision'' of S&amp;Ls, Fulwider said. He cited stricter capital
requirements for S&amp;Ls, regulatory action against conflicts of
interest, and an increased number of federal examiners.
   Bailout legislation passed by Congress last year to rescue the
S&amp;L industry could ultimately cost taxpayers $500 billion,
according to some estimates. The legislation transferred regulation
of S&amp;Ls from the Federal Home Loan Bank system to the OTS, a new
unit of the Treasury Department.

   President Bush and European Community leaders
say they'll intensify the search for a solution to a farm subsidy
battle that threatens to derail four years of talks on a new global
trade agreement.
   Bush met Tuesday with Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti,
head of the community's council of ministers, and with EC President
Jacques Delors.
   Delors planned to continue the talks with other administration
officials today, but there was no hint that a breakthrough was
imminent.
   The United States is seeking to eliminate 75 percent of current
domestic farm supports and import barriers and to reduce export
subsidies by 90 percent.
   The European Community, with its network of heavily subsidized
small family farms, has labeled the Bush proposal politically
unrealistic. The EC wants to trim 30 percent of 1986 farm supports
- which the United States says would be only a 15 percent cut from
current subsidies - while leaving the import barriers and export
subsidies untouched.
   The farm issue is considered central to completion of the
current round of global trade talks, which involve 105 nations
under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Thousands of farmers from France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland
demonstrated Tuesday in front of GATT headquarters in Geneva,
contending that the U.S. proposal threatened their livelihoods.
   Bush has made GATT reform his top trade priority in a belief
that lowering trade barriers offers the best chance of expanding
U.S. exports to reduce America's huge trade deficit, which has
topped $100 billion for the past six years.
   Without agreement to cut farm subsidies, Third World countries
say they will not go along with U.S. proposals to tighten copyright
protections for American companies and reduce barriers keeping U.S.
service companies - such as banks and insurance firms - from
expanding their overseas operations.
   Bush, addressing Andreotti during a White House departure
ceremony, said both sides had expressed a ``strong conviction that
we must succeed in substantial trade liberalization.''
   Bush said he and the EC leaders had agreed to ``make every
effort to insure the round concludes in the coming weeks.''
   Andreotti said failure to conclude the trade talks would ``bring
about serious damages'' to the global trading system, especially to
Third World nations.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills told reporters Tuesday the
administration remained committed to achieving a comprehensive
trade agreement during a final round of bargaining scheduled for
Dec. 3-7 in Brussels, less than three weeks away.
   ``The problem is not time. The problem is political will,'' she
said. ``We could solve this in three days if we had the political
will.''
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, whose committee
would have jurisdiction over whatever agreement is produced, said a
recent trip to Europe convinced him that the talks were in
``serious trouble'' with only about a 50-50 chance for success.
   He said there was significant opposition in Congress as well,
noting that 37 senators were sponsoring legislation to remove the
fast-track authority that would speed the measure's passage in
Congress.
   ``Any Uruguay Round agreement can be sold to Congress only if
the administration shows they have achieved a balanced package that
gives Americans greater access to markets abroad,'' Bentsen said.

<HEAD>Anonymous Buyer Snap up Mustang Ranch for $1.49 Million</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MUSTANG, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service let go of
Nevada's oldest legal bordello for $1.49 million at a bankruptcy
sale where most of the 1,000 bidders were more interested in nude
paintings and other kitsch.
   The future of the Mustang Ranch remained as clouded Tuesday as
the identity of its buyer.
   Storey County commissioners last month revoked the bordello's
permit, vowing never again to endure the ``circus'' that surrounded
the place for 35 years.
   During bidding on the 330-acre property Tuesday, there were no
takers at the asking price of $10 million. The winning bid was made
by Reno lawyer Victor Perry, who refused to identity the new owner.
   Perry's brother, Peter, is the lawyer of former Mustang owner
Joe Conforte. But Conforte denied he was secretly bidding.
   ``How can I?'' he asked. ``They've got me handcuffed
financially.''
   People had expressed interest in the property as a nursing home,
halfway house or home for wayward girls, said Dierdre Pagni, IRS
manager. She said even a religious group inquired about the
property, but she refused to give details.
   IRS agents padlocked the 104-room bordello Sept. 21, three days
after the property owned by Conforte and his wife, Sally, was
forced into liquidation.
   The government planned to apply the proceeds from the sale to
the $13 million in back taxes owed by the Confortes.
   ``My personal feeling is I hate to see this carnival happen,''
Conforte said of the auction. But he took part in the activities,
autographing items for buyers.
   He signed a painting of a partially clad woman bought for $190
by Mary Kay Walker and Bill Davis of San Diego. On vacation at
nearby Lake Tahoe, they said they came out of curiosity. ``This is
Nevada history,'' Ms. Walker said.
   A box of six T-shirts bearing a Mustang Ranch logo fetched $105,
while a case of pocket-sized ceramic liquor bottles adorned with
naked ladies sold for $260. Some of the larger paintings sold for
around $2,000
   A Reno-area couple purchased a nude portrait for $80.
   ``I liked it,'' said Marietta Shaw of Stead.
   ``It was cheaper than the T-shirts,'' said her husband, Michael
Shaw.
   Also on the auction block were boxed condoms and framed posters
pointing out the locations of Nevada's legal bordellos.
   Ray Grimm of Reno offered a successful bid of $395,000 for a
58-acre trailer park in nearby Lockwood. He said he planned to keep
the property as is.
   The Confortes founded the Mustang Ranch illegally in the 1950s.
In 1960, local authorities proclaimed it a public nuisance and
burned it to the ground.
   But a decade later Conforte won approval to operate legally,
paving the way for legalized prostitution in Nevada.

   For the first time in its 202-year history,
the Senate will have a woman sergeant-at-arms.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, following his party's
organizational caucus Tuesday, announced the appointment of Martha
Pope to succeed Henry Giugni in the powerful job.
   The sergeant-at-arms oversees a vast pool of patronage jobs, the
Senate's doorkeepers, police and support services for staff. In
rare instances, the sergeant-at-arms also is required to arrest
senators who fail to respond to roll calls in the Senate chamber,
and bring them to the floor to vote.
   Ms. Pope had been Mitchell's chief of staff.
   ``Martha Pope's understanding of the legislative process and of
the Senate as an institution makes her the most qualified person
for this office,'' he said.
   Mitchell nominated her to the post and she was elected by
acclamation by the Democratic caucus. Ms. Pope must still be
elected by a resolution by the full Senate in January.
   Giugni, a former member of the staff of Sen. Daniel Inouye,
D-Hawaii, has been sergeant-at-arms since 1987. He is leaving to
form his own consulting business.

<TEXT>
   Cells from a middle-aged man with terminal
cancer are being genetically altered at the National Institutes of
Health in preparation for the first use of gene therapy in the
treatment of cancer.
   An NIH team led by Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg received approval
Tuesday from the Food and Drug Administration to use the
experimental gene therapy in patients critically ill with advanced
melanoma, a deadly skin cancer.
   Rosenberg said his team had been poised for the approval and had
already been culturing cells from the first patient's tumors.
   ``Now that we've got approval we will go full speed ahead,'' he
said.
   The still-experimental therapy amplifies the body's own
cancer-fighting ability. It uses a type of white blood cells,
called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TIL, that naturally
invade and attack tumor tissue. A gene inserted into the TIL cell
adds a second natural anti-cancer protein.
   In the new therapy, TIL cells are removed from a patient's tumor
and placed into a culture. The scientists then add to the TIL cells
two new genes, one of which makes a powerful cancer fighter called
tumor necrosis factor, or TNF. The cells are further cultured until
they number in the billions and then are returned to the patient's
blood stream.
   The TIL cells, now carrying the TNF gene, migrate back to the
tumor sites. Doctors hope the treatment will bring powerful doses
of the natural tumor fighters directly against cells in the
melanoma tumors.
   Rosenberg said the first patient to receive the therapy will be
a middle-aged man who is in an advanced stage of melanoma with only
weeks to live. Two other patients are standing by and culturing of
their cells should start soon. He declined to further identify the
patients.
   The FDA gave the Rosenberg team permission to treat up to 50
melanoma patients using the new gene technique. Once the process is
started, the NIH scientists expect to add about one patient a week
to the treatment group.
   ``These are all patients with very limited life expectancy -
about three months,'' Rosenberg said.
   Rosenberg, Dr. R. Michael Blaese and Dr. W. French Anderson have
been seeking approval for more than a year to use the gene therapy
on patients. The technique was considered by six committees
organized by the NIH before the FDA approved it for limited use.
   Another form of gene therapy was approved Sept. 14 for the
treatment of an extremely rare inherited immune system disorder
called adenosine deaminase deficiency disease. That study's first
patient, a 4-year-old girl, received a transfusion of her own white
blood cells after a gene to correct the disorder had been inserted
into the cells.
   Rosenberg has been using unaltered TIL cells to treat melanoma
since 1987. But he said the cells seemed to help only about half of
the patients and the rest died of the disease.
   To strengthen the treatment, Rosenberg and his team turned to
genetic engineering techniques with the aim of arming the TIL cells
with the more powerful tumor necrosis factor. As a marker to
monitor treatment, the scientists also put into the TIL cells a
gene that is resistant to myacin antibiotics.
   Laboratory experiments in mice showed that the TIL-TNF cells
were very powerful against cancer in mice, Rosenberg said. ``In
rodents, the TNF made the tumors go away within hours,'' he said.
   But the laboratory animals are able to tolerate 40 times more of
the TNF than are humans. And, Rosenberg said, it takes a high dose
for the substance to kill tumors.
   The body naturally produces TNF in response to infection. The
protein also plays a role in regulation of inflammation and in
repairing injuries. However, if TNF is active throughout the body
for too long, it can cause shock and wasting.
   Melanoma is a skin cancer that usually cannot be successfully
treated once it becomes widespread. It is thought to be caused by
excessive exposure to the sun, particularly at a young age.
   The disease has been on the rise in the United States in recent
years, now striking about 10 of every 100,000 people.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Slightly, Tokyo Stocks Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar erased some of its gains but held its
ground against the Japanese yen Wednesday in Tokyo. Share prices
narrowed earlier losses but ended lower.
   The dollar closed at 129.05 yen, up 0.28 yen from Tuesday's
128.77-yen finish. It opened higher at 129.67 yen and ranged
between 129.02 yen and 129.80 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 36.23 points, or 0.15
percent, to end the day at 23,937.44. The index, which surged
1,041.87 points or 4.54 percent Tuesday, was a 148.47-point loser
at the end of the morning session before shrinking the losses in
the afternoon.
   The dollar opened higher against the yen after speculation that
the U.S. Federal Reserve Board would lower interest rates Tuesday
failed to materialize, dealers said.
   But the dollar gradually narrowed its gains as some investors
sold back the currency following its initial rise, they said.
   Toru Kanai, a currency analyst with New Japan Securities Co.,
said trading was thin because many investors remained on the
sidelines in continuing anticipation of the U.S. Federal Reserve
lowering interest rates.
   Lower U.S. interest rates tend to weaken the dollar.
   Shigeto Yanase, foreign exchange section manager at the Dai-ichi
Kangyo Bank, said market players avoided buying yen in part because
of rumors linking senior politicians with a stock insider trading
case currently under investigation.
   On the stock market, traders said index-linked large-scale
purchase by institutional investors supported the index in the
afternoon, traders said.
   They said the Nikkei's earlier decline was mainly because of
profit-taking after Tuesday's sharp advance.
   The index was unexpectedly well-supported considering the amount
of Tuesday's gain, which could have prompted more active selling
Wednesday, traders said.

Attack</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 2 million Americans unknowingly suffer from
a breathing disorder that doubles their risk of dying from a heart
attack, researchers say.
   The disorder, in which people stop breathing for 30 to 60
seconds or longer during sleep, is most common in people who snore,
said Dr. Bernard Burack, a cardiologist at the Montefiore Medical
Center's Sleep-Wake Center in New York.
   ``That doesn't mean everyone who snores is going to drop dead,''
Burack said. But patients with the snoring-related disorder have a
risk of heart-related death 2.1 times the national average, Burack
reported Tuesday at the annual scientific meeting of the American
Heart Association.
   The disorder is called obstructive sleep apnea. It occurs most
often in men, but when it occurs in women it is even more lethal,
Burack said.
   It tends to occur in people who are overweight, have high blood
pressure and heart arrhythmias, or rhythm disturbances, Burack
said. Daytme sleepiness is another indicator of the disorder,
because it often disrupts sleep.
   The disease is particularly dangerous in people who have
atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, Burack said.
   In a study of 223 patients, Burack and his colleagues found that
the patients died at a median age of 61, compared to the national
median of 78. Twenty of 35 deaths in the group occurred between 11
p.m. and 8 a.m.
   During an episode of sleep apnea, the amount of oxygen in the
bloodstream plummets. The heart may beat slowly or even stop
beating. The heart, already stressed by the lack of oxygen, is
further stressed by the abnormal rhythms.
   Efforts to breathe then produce an overdrive, often triggering
rapid heart rhythms. ``That can kick off, in somebody who's
vulnerable, a fatal rhythm,'' Burack said.
   Weight loss can help alleviate the condition in some people,
Burack said. Patients can also be fitted with a mask and air pump
that will force air into their mouths and keep the airways open
during sleep.
   ``The problem is people don't want to sleep with a mask over
their faces for the rest of their lives,'' Burack said.
   Surgery to remove excess tissue in the throat can sometimes
help. In extreme cases, an incision is made in patients' throats
that can be fitted with a plug meant to be removed at night.
   Burack said people who suspect they suffer from sleep apnea
should seek treatment in a sleep disorders clinic.

<HEAD>Widely Available Heart-Shock Devices Could Save Thousands</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Almost two-thirds of the 300,000 Americans who
drop dead suddenly each year from cardiac arrest might be saved if
automatic shocking machines were made as common as fire
extinguishers, heart specialists say.
   Catastrophic disturbances in the heart's normal rhythm - what
doctors call sudden death - account for about half of all heart
disease fatalities.
   Shocking the heart with a machine called a defibrillator can
restore normal beating. But the shock must be delivered within five
minutes, or the victim will die or suffer brain damage.
   ``This is an immense problem,'' said Dr. Douglas P. Zipes of the
University of Indiana. ``In terms of numbers, it far outstrips
everything else, but it's a solvable problem.''
   Zipes and other experts outlined the need for better and faster
care of cardiac arrest Tuesday at the annual scientific meeting of
the American Heart Association.
   Defibrillators have long been standard equipment in hospitals
for reviving patients whose hearts stop beating. But since most
such attacks occur outside the hospital and without warning, highly
automated devices have been developed that can be used by people
with relatively little training.
   Dr. James Atkins of the University of Texas in Dallas said only
5 percent to 15 percent of ambulances across the country carry
these devices. The machines can sense whether the victim's heart is
in fibrillation - quivering, disorganized beating that fails to
pump blood throughout the body. And if it finds this condition, it
delivers a shock that can restore normal beating.
   Even when ambulances and fire trucks carry the machines, getting
them to the victim in time is extremely difficult.
   Atkins said that in the best of cases, ambulances often need
five minutes to drive to the emergency, and they lose an additional
minute or two setting up the defibrillator. By that time, it is
probably too late to save the patient.
   Dr. W. Douglas Weaver of the University of Washington said that
even if all ambulances carried the machines and they responded
quickly, at best they might save one-quarter of patients in cardiac
arrest.
   Several experts agreed the best solution is easy-to-use
defibrillators that are stored in office buildings, stores, sports
arenas or wherever large numbers of people gather.
   ``We need to make devices that are cheap and idiot-proof,'' said
Zipes. ``They need to be as common as fire extinguishers wherever
there is a congregation of people. They could be snatched off the
wall, patches applied and then let the device do the work.''
   Current devices, while relatively simple, still require some
training to operate, and they cost between $4,000 and $7,000. He
said the technology already exists to mass-produce machines that
would cost between $500 and $1,000 and could be operated by
virtually anyone.
   A variety of research has shown that the faster the shock is
delivered, the better the chances of saving the victim.
   ``If you shock them in the first minute, virtually everyone
survives,'' said Atkins. ``It's all time.''
   Dr. Richard E. Kerber of the University of Iowa said nearly
two-thirds of victims of cardiac arrest have fibrillation, while
the rest have other rhythm disturbances that cannot be corrected
with electric shocks.
   ``This means that 60 percent of the 300,000 people who die have
a good chance of being revived'' if defibrillators became widely
available, he said.

<HEAD>Aspirin Taken With a Cocktail Will Get You Drunker, Rsearchers
Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taking a couple aspirins with a cocktail can get
you drunker, doctors warned today.
   Aspirin blocks the action of a stomach enzyme that breaks down
alcohol before it reaches the bloodstream, researchers reported in
the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``It's important that people be warned not to mix those two -
not to take aspirin before they drink, or rather, not to drink
after they take aspirin,'' Dr. Charles S. Lieber, director of the
Alcohol Research Center at the Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical
Center in New York, said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
   He and his colleagues studied aspirin and alcohol absorption in
five healthy men ages 30 to 45 years.
   Each man was given a standard breakfast, then an hour later, a
glass of juice containing three grams of alcohol per kilogram of
body weight - about a drink and a half for an average-size man,
Lieber said.
   The men underwent the procedure again, but first took one gram
of aspirin - the equivalent of two extra-strength tablets - with
breakfast.
   ``There was a 34 percent increase in the blood level of
alcohol,'' Lieber said.
   The same effect could occur on an empty stomach, but previous
studies have failed to show it, possibly because alcohol remains in
an empty stomach so briefly, the researchers said.
   Women would probably be more susceptible, said Lieber, who has
reported previously that women produce proportionally less of the
enzyme in their stomachs.
   Dr. Ernest P. Noble, director of the Alcohol Research Center at
the University of California in Los Angeles, said the findings are
important because many people consider aspirin a ``magic drug''
that can protect against heart attacks.
   ``If they're going to do their drinking, they should do it with
a full stomach, and not taking aspirin,'' said Noble, former
director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
   Lieber said people who take aspirin daily should do so in the
morning if they plan to drink at night. The findings do not mean
drinkers need to abandon the time-honored strategy of taking
aspirin before going to sleep to try to avert a hangover, he said.
   ``If they just go to bed, the alcohol will wear off,'' he said.
   More danger lies in going out to dinner, taking aspirin, having
a drink and driving home, he said. Another dangerous scenario he
cited included taking an an aspirin and having a beer or two at
lunch, returning to work and using machinery.
   Lieber said heavier drinking was not studied for ethical reasons
but that the effect would most likely be the same. Blood-alcohol
levels in the study's subjects ranged from 0.025 percent to 0.037
percent, well below the strictest standard of any state for
drunkenness in motorists - 0.08 percent, he said.
   ``We're not talking about drunkenness here,'' he said. But
``these are levels that impair one's capacity to drive or to
operate some sophisticated machinery.''

   Typhoon Mike roared into the South
China Sea on Wednesday after killing more than 40 people across the
central Philippines. First reports indicated severe devastation in
a major industrial center.
   About 100 people were missing and 320,000 jammed schools,
offices and makeshift evacuation centers. President Corazon Aquino,
who returned Wednesday from Japan, declared 30 of the country's 73
provinces disaster areas.
   Unconfirmed radio reports put the death toll at about 30 in
Cebu, a city of more than a half million people and the country's
second most important transport and industrial center after Manila.
   Telephone lines to the city were cut and residents reached by
radio from Manila, 350 miles to the north, said hundreds of
buildings were damaged and the city was without electricity.
   Nineteen ships sank in the storm, including 17 in Cebu harbor.
   Radio station DYHP in Cebu, which reported the 40 deaths, said
about 90 percent of all houses built of wood were damaged or
destroyed.
   Crisologo Enriquez, the Manila weather bureau's chief
forecaster, said the typhoon, which roared into the country early
Tuesday with peak winds of 150 mph, had weakened to 94 mph and was
continuing west at 14 mph.
   The Philippine coast guard said 25 crew members were missing
after the ship Dona Roberta sank near Cagayan de Oro, about 500
miles south of Manila. Three sailors also were missing after their
navy craft sank in Cebu harbor.
   On Negros Island, officials said 32 people were killed and 61
were missing. Twenty-seven of the dead perished in a landslide in
Isabela town, officials said. Five others drowned on the island.
   Relief agencies said at least 4,200 houses had either been
destroyed or damaged by the typhoon.
   The typhoon, which roared into the Philippines on Tuesday, was
the 14th to hit the country this year and struck the Leyte Island
first.
   Six people were killed either by drowning or crushed by falling
trees on the island, the Office of Civil Defense said.
   To the west on Panay Island, at least three people died,
including a 10-year-old boy hit by a tree, officials said.
   Three other bodies were recovered from the surf off Mindanao,
second largest of the 7,100 Philippine islands, officials said.

<HEAD>Cancer Treatments Will Keep Cranston From Keating Hearing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cancer treatments in California will prevent
Sen. Alan Cranston from attending much of the Senate Ethics
Committee's hearings int the ``Keating Five'' case.
   But the California Democrat who already has announced his
intention to retire in 1992 said Tuesday he will make an opening
statement once the hearings begin Thursday.
   One of the five senators under investigation, Cranston said he
will be unavailable next Monday and Tuesday, when his radiation
treatment for prostate cancer is to begin, and after Dec. 7, when
it is likely to have a weakening effect.
   In a letter to Ethics Committee Chairman Howell Heflin, D-Ala.,
and Vice Chairman Warren Rudman, R-N.H., Cranston said he could
appear before the committee this week, when opening statements are
expected. After then, he said, his answers would most likely have
to be in writing.
   The hearings will focus on five senators who received $1.3
million from Phoenix financier Charles H. Keating Jr. and also
intervened with regulators on behalf of Keating's failed Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association.
   The other senators targeted by the probe are John McCain,
R-Ariz.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and Donald
W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.
   The committee is trying to determine whether the contributions
influenced the actions of the senators in violation of the
chamber's rules.
   Cranston did not run Tuesday for re-election as Senate majority
whip. He said he would begin a seven-week course of radiation
therapy Monday at Stanford University School of Medicine. Dr.
Malcolm Bagshaw, professor and chairman of radiation oncology at
Stanford, will supervise the treatment.
   ``I naturally want to cooperate fully with the committee so that
the hearing proceedings may be carried out as expeditiously with as
little interruption as possible,'' Cranston wrote.
   ``I have been advised by Dr. Bagshaw that because of the side
effects of my treatment, deposition by written questions will be
the most appropriate way for me to adhere to the hearing
procedure.''
   The senator said he will ``put myself at the committee's
disposal in California between my daily radiation treatments.''

   Veronica Iversen was an expert on how to stop
smoking. She'd done it a half-dozen times.
   But after a few days, or the end of Lent, or her sister's
hospitalization, she always lit up again, despite her vows and
prayers.
   Finally, she sought help from a source to which a small but
growing number of heavy smokers are turning: a doctor.
   She chose Elliot Wineburg, a psychiatrist at Mount Sinai Medical
School who specializes in treatment of stress. About a third of his
practice consists of heavy smokers who want to quit.
   Public education and anti-smoking classes ``have filtered out
most of the people who can easily stop,'' he said. ``Now we're
seeing the hard core ... people who are desperate and ashamed.''
   And who need medical attention.
   ``A smoking problem is more than just a problem of will, it's an
illness,'' Wineburg said. ``Curing it takes more than `Just say
no.' You can't say that to an addict.''
   Attention must be individual, he argued, since, ``If you have a
sore throat your internist doesn't say, `Come to my lecture on
penicillin along with 20 other people.'''
   Depending on the patient, Wineburg may prescribe three types of
medicine: nicotine gum; antidepressant drugs, or clonidine, a drug
usually used to control blood pressure.
   In addition, he uses techniques such as hypnosis, biofeedback
and cognitive therapy to help smokers relieve their underlying
psychological problems.
   Within five weeks, Wineburg reports, 68 percent of his patients
stop smoking - compared to a rate of 20 percent for many programs
and courses.
   Wineburg treated Iversen, a single, 68-year-old retired
secretary from Brooklyn who was smoking a pack a day, for $750. The
fee was not covered by insurance because she was not suffering from
an ailment caused by smoking.
   On her first visit, Iversen insisted she didn't know why she
smokes - it was a bad habit with no purpose. But after prodding,
she admitted to a very good reason: ``If I'm tired it picks me up.
If I'm upset, it calms me down.''
   Iversen used nicotine to cope with everything from the drudgery
of housekeeping to the illness of her sister, who has Alzheimer's
disease.
   ``Nothing is more difficult than being worried about someone and
not being able to do anything about it,'' she said.
   At the beginning of her second visit, Iversen announced that
she'd smoked her last cigarette two hours earlier.
   Since nicotine is highly addictive, Wineburg needed to determine
how much Iversen had been ingesting. Told that she smoked a pack of
True Kings a day, Wineburg calculated that she consumed about eight
milligrams daily.
   He prescribed a daily dosage of four pieces of nicotine gum to
ease the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal and showed Iversen how to
chew the gum - slowly, not swallowing the saliva until the nicotine
could be absorbed through the cheek membrane.
   During her third visit, Wineburg tested Iversen and decided she
would not be a good candidate for deep hypnosis. He then showed her
a way to relax her body from the toes up. As he did so, he tried to
shore up her self-confidence, insisting, ``You are a very strong
person.'' He concluded by saying, ``I'm going home with you'' - and
handing her a cassette recording of their session.
   The following week Iversen talked about the times she is tempted
to smoke, and things she associates with smoking, such as an
occasional whiskey sour before dinner. ``You'll always want to
smoke,'' Wineburg told her. ``You can't get it out of your head.''
The trick, he said, is to know how to resist.
   On her fifth visit a therapist attached Iversen to a machine
that recorded the tension in her forehead muscles. As she watched a
video screen, she learned ways to relax those muscles in moments of
stress and tension. She also learned a technique of deep breathing
that reduces stress.
   That was April 19, 1989. Since then Veronica Iversen has not
smoked. She no longer gets scowls from other members of her church
group. She has taken up oil painting to occupy her hands and mind.
   And sometimes she would just love a cigarette.

   A federal panel waited five months before
announcing its finding that steroids can halve the death rate from
the pneumonia that is the leading killer of people with AIDS, The

   The panel withheld the announcement until Oct. 10 because

   Part of the reason they could not agree, said panel vice
chairman Dr. Paul Meier, was that the findings had not yet been
accepted at a prestigious medical journal, and they feared an early
announcement would jeopardize publication.
   Many medical journals have a policy of not publishing studies
that have been reported in the popular press. The journals say the
policy is aimed at ensuring that studies are subjected to scrutiny
by disinterested scientists.
   AIDS activists have attacked the policy as a barrier to the
release of life-saving information.
   The panel of 16 AIDS specialists and statisticians convened by
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases had
concluded on May 15 that a steroid hormone treatment can be
effective against pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
   The finding, and the delay in releasing it, came to light in the
Nov. 2 issue of AIDS Treatment News, a San Francisco-based
newsletter.
   The delay has angered members of the AIDS treatment and research
communities.
   ``When the lives of people are in the balance, it is totally
unethical not to release information immediately,'' said Dr.
Mathilde Krim, a founder of the American Foundation for AIDS
Research, a non-profit group in New York.
   Dr. Jerome Groopman, an AIDS researcher at the New England
Deaconess Hospital in Boston, said it is time to set new ground
rules for the release of potentially life-saving information.
   ``One of the things we're learning from AIDS is that the
situation has to change and adapt to all life-saving situations,''
Groopman said.

   Three outdoor disk-tossing games have been
recalled by their manufacturers in the wake of facial injuries to
children.
   The voluntary recalls announced Tuesday by the Consumer Product
Safety Commission involve the Yard Spinner, Style 3209, made by
Franklin Sports Industries of Stoughton, Mass.; the Lawn Discus,
made by Regent Sports Corp. of Hauppauge, N.Y., and the Pro Sport
Lawn Spinner, marketed by Service Merchandise Company, Inc., of
Brentwood, Tenn.
   Each of the games involve plastic disks shaped like flat fan
blades, nine inches in diameter. The disks have seven fins each,
with multiple holes in them.
   The commission said that Regent had learned of 12 facial and eye
injuries suffered by children struck by the disks and that Franklin
Sports knows of six similar cases involving its game.
   Consumers can identify the Franklin Sports disks by the words
``FRANKLIN'' and ``Yard Spinner,'' imprinted on the disks. The
Regent Sports disks have the words ``Regent'' and ``Lawn Discus''
imprinted and the Service Merchandise model has the word ``TAIWAN''
molded into the disks.

<HEAD>Air Force Withholds $240 Million Payment to Boeing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Air Force says the Boeing Co. has failed
to make satisfactory headway on an air defense network for Saudi
Arabia and is withholding $240 million in progress payments to the
aerospace company.
   Jack Rankin, a spokesman for the Air Force's Electronic Systems
Division at Hanscom Air Force Base, Mass., said Tuesday the primary
complaint was Boeing's failure to meet a Sept. 30 deadline for
software testing.
   The Washington-based publication Defense Week, quoting a
government documents, said the Air Force had told Boeing it was
considering terminating the $3.7 billion contract for the ``Peace
Shield'' program. Rankin said he could not confirm this.
   In Seattle, Boeing spokesman Don Brannon conceded that progress
payments had been withheld and that the Air Force was unhappy with
the company's failure to meet the Sept. 30 test date.
   ``We are behind schedule as far as the program is concerned
because of the difficulties that we experienced in the software
development,'' Brannon said. But he said tests of the software have
begun and ``are proceeding better than anticipated.''
   The Boeing spokesman said the company has completed design and
development of the system and has completed half of its work on 17
radar sites being built in Saudi Arabia as part of the network.

<HEAD>Vaccine Compensation Claims Deadline Extended,</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is extending until Jan. 31,
1991, the deadline for victims of vaccine-related injuries to file
claims under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.
   The deadline for claimants injured on or prior to Oct. 1, 1988,
had been Oct. 1, 1990, but Congress extended it another four
months. Those who miss the deadline can still pursue claims in
civil courts.
   The federal program was set up as a faster, less expensive
procedure to get compensation for vaccine-related injuries. Under
it, petitioners have to prove only that injuries are related to a
vaccine, not that the manufacturer of the vaccine was at fault.
   Covered by the program are diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis
vaccines; the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine; the oral polio
vaccine; and the inactivated polio vaccine.
   Claims for injuries after Oct. 1, 1988, must be filed by
deadlines stipulated in the National Childhood Injury Act.
   The amount of compensation is determined by a U.S. Claims Court,
based on the needs of the injured person and the extent of the
injury. The maximum death benefit is $250,000.
   Information on how to file a claim may be obtained from the U.S.
Claims Court, 717 Madison Place NW, Washington, D.C. 20005. The
Department of Health and Human Services' Health Resources and
Services Administration also offers a toll-free hotline,
800-338-2382.

<TEXT>
   Police have unearthed the remains of two
people and believe up to three more are buried in a cornfield near
the boyhood home of a man charged with murder in one of the deaths.
   Guided by tips and anonymous letters, authorities Tuesday combed
220 acres near Highland, about 30 miles from St. Joseph, Mo., for
more bodies.
   Hunters on Sunday came across a skull and bones in the field,
and officers on Monday unearthed a body.
   The skeletal remains have not been identified, but the body was
identified Tuesday as that of Crystal Simmons, 33, who vanished
from St. Joseph on Oct. 29. An autopsy showed she died of blows to
the head, investigators said.
   Marvin Irvin, 41, was charged Thursday with murdering Ms.
Simmons. He was one of the last people seen with her, and blood was
found in his truck, authorities said.
   Police said her body and the skeletal remains were found about
100 yards apart near land formerly owned by Irvin's family.
   Irvin, a former St. Joseph police officer, had been on parole
the past year for assault on an Iowa woman, police said. He is
being held in a Missouri jail.
   Sgt. Jim Connors, a St. Joseph police spokesman, said recent
tips and anonymous letters received in the past four years by
police and reporters lead police believe at least five people have
been buried on the property.
   They include 19-year-old woman who vanished in 1979 and a
31-year-old woman who has been missing since Sept. 17, authorities
said. Both were from St. Joseph.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Tokyo Stocks Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained against the Japanese yen today,
while share prices fell slightly in profit-taking and uncertainty
over U.S. interest rates, traders said.
   The dollar closed at 129.05 yen, up 0.28 yen from Tuesday's
128.77-yen finish. It opened at 129.67 yen and ranged between
129.02 yen and 129.80 yen in quiet trading that totaled some $8.18.
   The dollar started strong after gaining overnight on overseas
markets. An expected lowering of the interest rate by the U.S.
Federal Reserve Board, which would have made the dollar less
attractive, did not materialize, dealers said.
   But dollars were being sold again Wednesday afternoon in Tokyo,
said Masato Hayashi, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``The dollar's afternoon slip resulted from position adjustments
because investors still expect that the (U.S.) Fed will lower
interest rates today,'' he added.
   Hayashi said the dollar's afternoon slide against the yen also
was prompted by its weakness against the major European currencies,
especially the German mark.
   Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities
Co., said trading was thin because many investors remained on the
sidelines in continuing anticipation of lower U.S. interest rates.
   Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank's Shigeto Yanase said market players
avoided buying yen in part because of rumors linking senior
politicians with a stock insider-trading case currently under
investigation.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost
36.23 points, or 0.15 percent, closing at 23,937.44. The index,
which surged 1,041.87 points, or 4.54 percent Tuesday, was down
148.47 points at the end of the morning session before rebounding
somewhat.
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 350
million shares, down from Tuesday's 400 million.
   Traders said profit-taking following Tuesday's sharp advance and
uncertainty about U.S. interest rates pushed down large-capital
issues, such as steel.
   Institutional investors' index-linked large-scale buying
supported the index in the afternoon but continuing profit-taking
by other investors dampened a recovery, they said.
   The index was unexpectedly well supported considering the amount
of Tuesday's gain, which could have prompted more active selling
today, traders said.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 84.69 points by 5 p.m. (3 a.m.
EST) from Tuesday's 84.55-point finish. Their yield fell to 7.780
percent from 7.810 percent.

<HEAD>Desert Shield Soldiers Shipped to Germany With Broken Bones,
Snakebite</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>

<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,400 U.S. troops assigned
to Operation Desert Shield have been airlifted to Germany for
treatment of broken bones, depression, snake bites and other
afflictions, military officials say.
   But the Army is treating fewer GIs than anticipated for a
population of 230,000 people, ``based on health risk assessments
for that region of the world,'' said Barbara Slifer, spokeswoman
for the Army's 7th Medical Command in Heidelberg.
   Forty-three soldiers have died in the deployment, mostly in
accidents.
   Officials say two Army hospitals in Germany had received 926
evacuated patients as of Tuesday afternoon, and the Air Force
hospital in Wiesbaden had received 515 since Aug. 11, when U.S.
troops were sent to Saudi Arabia.
   The figures mean that of the 230,000 GIs sent to the Persian
Gulf region, about one soldier in every 166 has had a medical
problem.
   Some have been treated and returned to the Persian Gulf region,
and others with more serious conditions have been transferred to
the United States, said Ms. Slifer.
   She said 88 remained hospitalized at the Army's regional
hospital in Frankfurt and 53 in the regional hospital at Landsthul.
Capt. Robert Lenahan of the Air Force's hospital in Wiesbaden said
39 Desert Shield patients were still there as of Tuesday.
   Military medical officials have said that facilities newly set
up in the gulf region can care for most casualties as well as
hospitals anywhere. But evacuating patients to Germany keep beds
free in the gulf in case of hostilities.
   The medical problems ``run the gamut,'' Ms. Slifer said.
   ``The predominant area of care that we've been providing is
orthopedic, broken bones. We've had one snakebite case, we've had
gallbladder attacks,'' she said.
   She said a few soldiers were also sent back for psychological
care.
   ``I think the psychological ailments are pretty much what you
would expect in any type of military-type environment.''
   Most of the patients coming through Wiesbaden are sent back to
the United States, unless they can be treated in ``a fairly short
timeframe,'' Lenahan said.
   ``But we have people coming back with kidney stones, torn knee
ligaments, things that take more than just a couple of weeks to
repair,'' Lenahan said.
   He said that long-term patients requiring treatment of more than
three to four weeks are sent back to the United States ``so that we
still have enough empty beds here for other patients that may come
up.''
   In addition to injuries, patients needed treatment for
allergies, asthma and dermatological problems, he said.
   He said that the allergies and asthma are apparently due to the
very dry climate in Saudi Arabia. ``People who wouldn't normally
have asthma problems are experiencing that.''

<TEXT>
   Poor Milwaukee youngsters can continue to
attend private schools at taxpayer expense while the state drafts
an appeal of a ruling that the program was unconstitutionally
enacted, officials say.
   A state appeals court Tuesday struck down on a legal
technicality the law establishing Milwaukee's first-in-the-nation
School Choice program.
   It said the program was passed in violation of the Wisconsin
Constitution, which forbids sneaking through ``local'' programs in
state budget bills.
   The court did not address the program's merits.
   Roger Sundby, an executive assistant to the state schools
superintendent, said his agency will let it continue for at least
30 days, the period allowed for lawyers to appeal to the state
Supreme Court.
   The program has been praised by the Bush administration for
creating a healthy competition between public and private schools.
   Critics sued to block the program, arguing it undermined state
efforts to ensure that educational standards are met at private
schools and ignored the majority of students left behind in public
schools.
   A judge rejected those arguments in August, ruling the program
served a legitimate public purpose. The case went to the appeals
court.
   ``I'm sad they did not make a decision on merits, just on the
process,'' said Gov. Tommy G. Thompson.
   ``Parental choice is a model program that holds great promise
for disadvantaged children in Milwaukee's poorest neighborhoods,''
he said. ``It must be given an opportunity to prove its
potential.''
   The program, passed by the Legislature in the spring, was
authorized to provide $2,500 each for as many as 1,000 students
this year, but only about 400 were able to enroll in about 10
eligible private schools because of space limitations.
   The money is deducted from the state aid provided to the
Milwaukee public school system, which has about 97,000 students.
   The ruling implies that lawmakers can rewrite the law and
salvage the program. Senate Majority Leader Dave Helbach said such
an effort will be undertaken when lawmakers reconvene in January.

<TEXT>
   An Indian relief official bitterly
withdrew his name from consideration for the post of U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees after charging Western officials with a
``demeaning'' bias against non-Europeans.
   The United States and other Western countries had strongly
objected to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar's choice of
Virenda Dayal, his chief of staff, for the post.
   Dayal, a former Indian civil servant, sent a letter to Perez de
Cuellar withdrawing from consideration, U.N. spokesman Francois
Giuliani said Tuesday. Giuliani said it was ``accepted with
regret.''
   ``Given the present controversy as to whether a non-European can
be worthy of the post, which I find demeaning, I would appreciate
it if my name could be withdrawn from consideration,'' Dayal wrote.
   ``There is no way in which I can develop the attributes of a
Western-European politician, whether in or out of office. And I
would not wish UNHCR or the refugees of the world to be deprived of
funding on that account,'' he said.
   The U.N. High Commissioner serves a three-year term and oversees
programs for an estimated 15 million refugees. Both Western and
Third World nations are seeking a strong and independent candidate
who can appeal for more funds and public support for refugees.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Tuesday that the
Bush administration was ``extremely concerned over reports that we
heard last week that the secretary-general intended to appoint the
next high commissioner without consulting concerned governments.''
   The United States is the single largest donor to the refugee
program, providing $117 million of its $550 million budget, Boucher
said.
   Cnada, Britain, France, Austria, Belgium and New Zealand have
all put forth their own candidates; they are expected to confer
with the United States and agree on a nominee who is a Westerner.
   The director of the State Department's office of refugee
programs, Princeton Lyman, was leaving today on a foreign trip to
interview candidates.
   On Monday, a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the Bush administration was ``outraged'' that Perez de Cuellar
insisted last week that either the commissioner or deputy
commissioner be from the Third World.
   Washington took that as a threat to fire the deputy, American
Douglas Stafford, if Dayal didn't get the top post.
   U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes denied there had been a suggestion
Stafford would be eliminated. She also denied there had been no
consultations with the U.S. Mission on Dayal's candidacy.
   Dayal was a senior official in the refugees program from
1965-1979, serving as regional representative to U.N. headquarters
and as executive assistant to the high commissioner.
   The previous commissioner, Thorvald Stoltenberg, resigned two
weeks ago to become deputy prime minister of Norway.
   Stoltenberg had replaced Jean-Pierre Hocke, who resigned in
October 1989 when it was disclosed he used a special education fund
to upgrade his airline travel to first class, at a cost of about
$300,000.
   The secretary-general appoints the commissioner, and the General
Assembly approves the candidate in a vote.
   Perez de Cuellar, who was traveling in Japan and Europe and was
to return to New York next week, will have to see who emerges as
the Western candidate, or propose another himself.

   A jury asked for death by injection for
a 69-year-old farm wife convicted of murdering five drifters in an
alleged attempt to cover up a cattle-rustling scheme.
   If a judge accepts the recommendation, Fay Copeland will become
the oldest person in Missouri to receive the death penalty since it
was reinstated in 1977.
   She was convicted Saturday of five counts of murder. The jury
Tuesday recommended death on four of the charges and life in prison
on the fifth.
   Under the law, Judge E. Richard Webber may accept the jury's
decision or give her life without parole. No sentencing date was
set.
   Defense attorney David Miller said he will appeal.
   Mrs. Copeland wept quietly and held the hands of Miller and a
son, Al Copeland, as the jury's decision was read.
   Authorities said the victims were unwitting participants in a
cattle-buying scheme orchestrated by Mrs. Copeland's 75-year-old
husband, Ray.
   Four bodies were found in shallow graves and the fifth was found
in a well. All had been shot in the head. Prosecutor Doug Roberts
called it ``one of the worst, if not the worst, cases of serial
murder in the state's history.''
   Prosecutors charged that Copeland hired the drifters at
missions, promising them $50 a day plus room and board to act as
cattle buyers. Copeland had the men buy livestock with bad checks
and then killed them to conceal the thefts, they said.
   Authorities said Mrs. Copeland was his partner in the scheme,
which netted the couple $32,000 from 1986 to 1989. The defense
contended she was dominated by her husband and did not know of his
business dealings.
   Copeland's murder trial begins Jan. 24. His attorneys contend he
is senile and incompetent to stand trial.
   A drifter who once worked for the couple told authorities last
year that bodies were buried at their small farm about 90 miles
from Kansas City.
   No bodies were found on the farm, but police unearthed victims
at area farms where Copeland performed odd jobs over the years.
   A list in Mrs. Copeland's handwriting with an ``X'' marked next
to the names of several of the victims was a key piece of evidence.

   A Renoir portrait of his nephew sold for $7.04
million at an auction of the artworks with which Greta Garbo was
alone in her final years.
   The auction at Sotheby's on Tuesday night attested to the
public's enduring fascination with the reclusive actress and gave
the otherwise slumping art market a glamorous boost.
   While one of Garbo's Renoirs failed to sell, three other
paintings from her apartment on Manhattan's East Side sold for
$15.9 million, near or above the level expected by the auction
house.
   ``People like to own things that have been owned by famous
people,'' said auctioneer John Marion.
   Surprisingly to some, the paintings from the actress' sanctuary
depict intimate human scenes in brilliant colors.
   The Renoir that brought the highest price was ``Portrait of
Edmund Renoir Jr.,'' which went to an anonymous buyer. The 1889 oil
is a portrait of the son of Renoir's brother. The child has
waist-length blond hair and a dark blue coat.
   The painting's pre-sale estimate was $4 million to $6 million.
   The contents of Garbos's apartment being auctioned off this week
are estimated to be worth at least $20 million. Much of the value
is attributed to Garbo's ownership of the works.
   Also the auction block this week are hundreds of other items
from Garbo's apartment, including a carpet estimated to be worth
$50,000, upholstered chairs for $10,000 each, and a perfume bottle
in the shape of a wizard worth $600.
   The actress lived alone for 37 years in the building. She filled
the place with paintings and porcelain that she bought at Manhattan
galleries, where she was known as G.G. or ``Ms. Brown.''
   Renoir's ``Leontine and Coco'' brought $5.7 million. It also
went to an anonymous buyer. The 1909 oil depicts the artist's young
son, Coco, reading in the company of a young nursemaid.
   A third Renoir, ``Secret,'' did not sell. The highest bid was
$1.5 million, and did not meet the pre-sale estimate of $2 million
to $3 million. The 1897 painting shows an unidentified model and
composer Claude Terrasse.
   Pierre Bonnard's ``The Corn Poppies'' brought $3.19 million from
an anonymous buyer. It was painted circa 1914-15 and shows a
graceful white pitcher with a falling cherry design, and a small
dog in a chair.
   Also auctioned Tuesday was a collection of other Impressionist
and modern paintings.
   The highest price went for Monet's ``Water Lillies,'' which
brought $9.45 million against a pre-sale estimate of $7 million to
$9 million. It was bought by a Japanese dealer.

   President Bush has extended the state of
emergency with Iran stemming from its 1979 seizure of the U.S.
Embassy and American hostages in Tehran.
   ``Because our relations with Iran have not yet returned to
normal ... the national emergency declared on Nov. 14, 1979, must
continue in effect,'' Bush said in the annual renewal notice to
Congress published Tuesday in the Federal Register.
   Iran seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4, 1979. Former
President Jimmy Carter declared a state of national emergency with
Iran 10 days later, allowing the U.S. government to freeze Iranian
assets and impose other economic sanctions.
   The last of the remaining 52 hostages were released by Iran on
Jan 20, 1981, just after President Reagan was inaugurated into
office. A state of emergency must be renewed every year prior to
its anniversary date or the economic and diplomatic sanctions it
imposes would otherwise expire.

   The steel industry is working to remove
the dirtiest ingredient in its 378-year-old steel recipe - coke.
   The $44 million, four-year experiment in this Pittsburgh suburb
to make steel in a cleaner, more efficient way could clear the air
near coke ovens and help steelmakers meet federal pollution
standards, but could also mean layoffs.
   The American Iron and Steel Institute and U.S. Department of
Energy unveiled their research on Tuesday.
   ``What you have is steel without all the stink,'' said Carnegie
Mellon University professor R.J. Fruehan, a researcher on the
project.
   An American company will be selling steel made with the new
cokeless process by 2005, said Ian Hughes, technology vice
president at Inland Steel Corp.
   At least one environmental activist is sketical the changes
will come anytime soon.
   ``Coke will be around for a long time, and it's certainly going
to be another generation of our children before these changes are
in place,'' said David Jasnow, a board member of the Group Against
Smog and Pollution.
   In the method first used in blast furnaces in 1612 in England,
steel is made by melting iron ore to remove oxygen, then mixing the
liquid iron with limestone and coke. Coke is almost pure carbon
made by baking impurities from coal.
   The iron-coke-limestone mixture then must go through two
furnaces before it is finished into steel.
   The experimental process mixes coal, iron ore and limestone to
make liquid steel in one step.
   Hughes said the new technology, combined with other advances in
steel finishing and rolling, would cut the current 1,000-hour
method of making steel to 10 hours while demanding the same amount
of coal from American mines.
   The steel industry's work force would be halved ``if all of this
eventually works out,'' said project director Egil Aukrist.
   The one-step process will cut energy costs by 20 percent, saving
$10 to $25 per ton of steel, AISI said.
   The process should help big steelmakers such as USX, Bethlehem
Steel Corp and LTV Steel Co. regain market share lost to imports,
said Joe Goodwin, director of the Center for Materials Research at
Carnegie Mellon University.
   Japanese steelmakers are developing technology similar to AISI's
cokeless production, officials said.

   Israel launched a new crackdown on the nearly
3-year-old Palestinian uprising today, imposing widespread curfews
and announcing plans to halve the Arab work force from the occupied
lands.
   The curfews were to prevent demonstrations on the eve of the
second anniversary of the Palestinian state declared by the
Palestine Liberation Organization's parliament in exile on Nov. 15,
1988.
   The measures also came a day after two key pro-PLO Palestinian
activists were ordered jailed for six months without trial for
alleged involvement in inciting a wave of attacks against Israelis
in the past month.
   Israeli left-wingers protested the detentions of Radwan Abu
Ayyash, 40, of Ramallah in the West Bank and Ziad Abu Ziad, 50 of
Jerusalem.
   Abu Ayyash heads the Arab Journalists' Union and Abu Ziad edits
a Hebrew-language Palestinian weekly.
   ``The message of the Israeli government to the Palestinian
leadership is clear: there is no point in being a moderate,'' said
Dedi Zucker of the Citizens' Rights Movement.
   Yossi Beilin of the left-of-center Labor Party warned that ``the
price is liable to be more unnecessary bloodshed.''
   The curfews in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip confined
roughly 420,000 people indoors. Schools were also shut in the West
Bank, keeping 300,000 Arab pupils away from classrooms.
   Holiday celebrations were launched Tuesday night in Gaza and the
West Bank in anticipation of the curfews. Activists set off
firecrackers, draped outlawed Palestinian flags over electric wires
and marched in the streets, Arab reports said.
   Demonstrations persisted today before the curfews. In Gaza
City's commercial district, school girls marched chanting pro-PLO
and pro-Iraqi slogans, Arab reports said.
   One chant was: ``Saddam, fire the chemical weapons!''
   In Israel, authorities rounded up 1,350 Palestinians working
without security permits, Army radio said. The sweep was part of a
campaign launched last month in the wake of a spate of stabbing
attacks in Israel.
   Labor Minister David Magen said the government would institute
new policies that he expected to cut by more than half the number
of Palestinians working in Israel.
   ``The government will discuss new labor laws. The significance
will be a serious reduction in the number of workers from the
territories,'' Magen said on Israel radio.
   Magen added he expected 60,000 of about 108,000 Palestinians
employed in Israel to lose their jobs. The slack would be taken up
by Soviet immigrants and discharged soldiers, he said.
   The so-called administrative detentions of Abu Ayyash and Abu
Ziad were announced several hours after an infiltrator from Jordan
shot and killed an Israeli soldier Tuesday.
   Security officials blamed the attack on the PLO's mainstream
Fatah movement and the Moslem fundamentalist group Islamic Jihad.
It was the seventh infiltration this year along the previously
quiet Jordan frontier.
   Right-wing legislators voiced concern that Jordan's support for
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was encouraging the attacks. The
army stepped up patrols along the frontier today, Israel radio
said.
   Also Tuesday, two policemen were wounded in a stabbing in
Jerusalem's old walled city, only four days after another policeman
was attacked near the same site.
   Both Abu Ayyash and Abu Ziad were accused of being senior
figures in Fatah and in the underground leadership of the uprising.
A Defense Ministry statement said both were either involved in
writing leaflets calling for attacks on Israelis or directing
``strike forces'' to conduct violence.
   Israeli reports said a physician in Gaza, Ahmed Al-Yaziji, was
also placed under administrative detention for one year on
allegations of involvement with Fatah.
   The imprisonment of the three Palestinians without trial was
ordered under emergency regulations adopted by the British in 1945,
when they ruled Palestine, and kept on the law books by Israel.
   Israelis have killed more than 770 Palestinians in the uprising
that began Dec. 8, 1987 against Israel's occupation of lands seized
in the 1967 Middle East war. More than 290 Arabs have been killed
as collaborators by other Arabs, and more than 50 Israelis and
foreigners have died.

   A high-pressure system moved east from the Plains today, chasing
away the chilly weather that had gripped the East Coast and leaving
clear skies across the eastern two-thirds of the nation.
   A winter storm moved across the Pacific Northwest and into
California's Northern Sierra, however, bringing lower temperatures
and the threat of heavy snow in the mountains. The Sierra was
expected to get a foot by tonight.
   Fair weather was forecast for the East Coast, Midwest and South.
Highs were expected to range from the 40s in the North to the 60s
and 70s in the middle regions and the 80s in the South.
   Highs along the West Coast ranged from the 50s in the north to
the 60s and 70s in California.
   The high temperature for the nation Tuesday was 94 degrees at
Borrego Springs, Calif.

<DATELINE>IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A chill wind blew dust into every
pore. At times, visibility on the desert plain dropped to about 100
yards. But there was no morale problem for a U.S. Special Forces
team preparing Kuwaitis for war.
   American troops elsewhere in Saudi Arabia may be clamoring to go
home, but in the shrubless, stony desert wasteland of eastern Saudi
Arabia on Tuesday, 10 hardened U.S. soldiers were embarked on a
mission that stirred their emotions.
   ``You have a cause worth fighting for,'' said the officer
commanding the team, which includes both Special Forces and regular
Army experts. ``Talking with the Kuwaitis you seen their concern
for their families ... for their country. Being a family man, I
cannot help being moved.''
   Staff Sgt. Barry D. Sparlin, 29, of Houston, said it was time to
stop Iraqi President Saddam Hussein before he gets nuclear weapons.
   ``We're here ... to prevent our children from having to do the
same thing we're here for right now,'' he said.
   Part of Kuwait's 20,000-man army escaped to Saudi Arabia with
their tanks after the Iraqis overran their country on Aug. 2. They
have been camping in the desert for several months.
   For soldiers like Capt. Ali, a 34-year-old tank commander,
waiting for the order to attack has become almost an obsession.
   ``We want revenge,'' said Ali, who didn't identify himself
further because his wife and four children are still in Kuwait.
``We didn't have a chance that day when they surprised us. But now
we are ready.''
   The chief U.S. adviser, speaking on condition he not be
identified, agreed that all the Kuwaitis need is some equipment:
``They're as good as any brigade anywhere in the world, in any
army.''
   The Kuwaitis could use more tanks, spare parts and ammunition
for the existing Martyrs Brigade. A second brigade being formed has
manpower but no armor. A brigade normally has from 4,500 to 5,000
soldiers, about the number of regular Kuwaiti forces who escaped to
Saudi Arabia, and more than 100 tanks.
   The U.S. team arrived in the Kuwaiti camp only about two weeks
ago, just before the Americans and Saudis agreed on a joint command
for operations inside the country and U.S. command of any
operations outside Saudi Arabia.
   Some 145,000 Arab troops, under Saudi command, are part of the
more than 350,000-strong multinational force confronting Iraq.
   The U.S. officer said he didn't know why it had taken so long to
get American advisers into the field.
   But he said ``the time has been put to good use'' and the
confusing command structure among the Arab forces had been
straightened out.
   The American team leader said he assumed other U.S. advisers
were also based with Syrian troops.
   His men had an unscheduled meeting with the Syrians one night:
They got lost and drove into the Syrian camp where they were
stopped by an alert sentry who checked them out and sent them back
to the Kuwaiti camp.
   Sgt. Paul Evans, 28, of Vista, Calif., said relations with the
Kuwaitis were so good that team members were invited to dinner
almost every night. That meant lamb or chicken with rice and
potatoes instead of pre-packaged Army meals.
   The Americans refused to discuss their role, saying only that
they were coordinating activity between U.S. units and the Kuwaiti
brigade.
   ``The Americans are training us on many things we need to face
Iraq,'' said Capt. Ali. ``They are very good soldiers - they just
want to help.''
   Ali said Americans were training Kuwaitis to deal with chemical
weapons, to communicate with U.S. aerial command posts to call in
air strikes, and to use TOW anti-tank missiles more effectively.
   ``They teach us Iraqi doctrines. They teach us about Iraqi
minefields and they teach us how to handle prisoners,'' he said.
   A Kuwaiti captain in intelligence, speaking anonymously, said
the Americans were also teaching the Kuwaitis house-to-house
warfare, which would be essential in liberating Kuwait City.
   The chief U.S. adviser said winds gusting between 20 and 30 mph
were churning up dust Tuesday and curtailed training. But the
colder weather was welcome, he said, because it meant fewer flies.
   The location of the camp could not be revealed under military
rules.

<DATELINE>ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia said today
that it won't take part in a proposed Arab summit until Iraq
pledges to pull out of Kuwait.
   ``Any Arab meetings will bear no fruit or results'' unless Iraq
promises to adhere to the resolutions of the emergency Arab summit
held in August and of the United Nations, said the foreign
minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal.
   Prince Saud's statements were distributed by the official
Emirates news agency, WAM, following his arrival and a meeting with
President Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al Nahyan.
   Saud's was the first Saudi comment on the proposal by King
Hassan II of Morocco for an emergency Arab summit to work out an
Arab solution to the Persian Gulf crisis and avert war over Iraq's
refusal to quit Kuwait, which it seized Aug. 2.
   The comment came as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
second-in-command and first deputy prime minister, Taha Yassin
Ramadan, returned to Baghdad from a meeting with Hassan in Morocco.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said Ramadan stressed to Hassan
``the need to provide a positive atmosphere and to make mature
ideas available for discussion at the level of an Arab summit.''
   The Iraqis have said Saddam would consider attending such a
summit if it first consulted on the time and place - and if the
Palestinian issue is on the agenda.
   INA said Ramadan said an Arab summit would ``erase the infamous
Cairo summit resolutions, which created divisions in the Arab
stance toward the dangers and the collusion against the Arab nation
created by its enemies, led by the United States and its allies.''
   At the August emergency summit in Cairo, 14 of the Arab League's
21 members voted to condemn the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and
demand Iraq's withdrawal, while six either abstained or voted
against the measure.
   The six were Sudan, Palestine, Jordan, Mauritania, Iraq and
Yemen. Libya was not represented at the meeting.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the
United States and abroad.

   Nov. 13
   Birmingham (Ala.) Post-Herald on the Persian Gulf crisis:
   Whatever lies ahead in the Persian Gulf, the large new
deployment of forces ordered by President Bush is justified. ...
   The magnitude of the force being built up in the gulf sends a
necessary message, too, to all Americans: This commitment is
irrevocable - and may be costly.
   War against Iraq would be no quick-fix intervention on the order
of Grenada or Panama. It could be long and bloody.
   President Bush, who has handled many aspects of the gulf crisis
with skill, has yet to level with the public about the possible
sacrifice ahead.
   ---
   Nov. 11
   Grand Forks (N.D.) Herald on the Persian Gulf:
   It would be reassuring if Bush toned down the rhetoric while he
built up the armies, as well. There may yet be a diplomatic
solution to this crisis.
   There have been suggestions that Iraq might be satisifed with
better access to the sea, control of an uninhabited sandbar and an
indemnity for Kuwait's well-documented theft of oil and its
shenanigans in the oil cartels. With these conditions, Kuwait could
be restore as an independent nation, perhaps with a U.N.
peace-keeping force stationed there.
   If such a settlement is possible, it ought to be sought.
   It is far more attractive than the war.
   Saddam may yet reject it, of course. Then the consequences are
on his shoulders. If it is not offered before thousands of lives
are lost, the president will need to explain his failure as a
diplomat to his people and to history.

   Nov. 13
   The Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette on the Persian Gulf:
   Is President Bush preparing to invade Iraq and Kuwait, without
asking Congress for a declaration of war, just as he invaded Panama
without Congress' approval? Would he do it without a United Nations
decision authorizing warfare?
   Questions like these hang in the air as Bush continues his
bellicose tone and his military buildup in the Middle East. ...
   Bush contends that he is acting to deter aggression, to undo
Iraq's seizure of tiny Kuwait. But that's window-dressing. ... No,
America and other nations are acting strictly to protect the
Mideast oil supply that sustains the industrialized world - an
understandable goal.
   The nagging question is: does one man have the right, all by
himself, to plunge America into a major war? ...
   We would feel less uneasy if he would promise not to send
400,000 young Americans into a blood bath without asking Congress
first.

   Delaware County Daily Times, Primos, Pa., on the death of
Stormie Jones:
   Doctors are vigorously trying to find out what exactly killed
Stormie Jones, the 13-year-old Texas girl who underwent a historic
heart-liver transplant in 1984. ...
   But all forensic medical technology in the world is useless in
telling us what kept Stormie going and her chin up the past 6{
years.
   Stormie battled her way through hell - a living hell. She
survived a war in which many of us would have been mentally
conquered. ...
   This courageous little girl captured the hearts of America -
time and time again as she showed us all how to manhandle adversity
and what it really means to live. ...

   The Marietta (Ohio) Times on the U.S. elections:
   An expert, as most people know, is someone who offers an opinion
from far away. ``Pork barrel'' is used to describe government money
that funds a project in somebody else's neighborhood. Now,
Tuesday's national election figures have given us a new definition:
``Bum'' is somebody else's congressman.
   ``Throw the bums out!'' supposedly was the cry of the land, at
least according to media prophets before the election.
   Wednesday morning, however, America woke up to find Congress
almost exactly as it was before the vote - before the budget-tax
debacle, before the savings and loan bailout, before the pay raise
issue, before ethics inquiries, before any of the other decisions
that supposedly inflamed right-thinking patriots ...
   So, basically, on election day, we got what we asked for. We
apparently are being duly represented.

   Nov. 12
   The New Mexican, Santa Fe, N.M., on the elections:
   What the voters did on Nov. 6 should give neither the
Republicans nor the Democrats much comfort.
   Neither major party really won or lost much. Although the
returns gave a few members reason to worry because of the closeness
of the tally, they set the U.S. on no new course. The state of the
economy and events in the Persian Gulf will probably do more to
shape politics in the next two years than did Election Day, 1990. .
..
   If messages were sent to Congress they were that taxes are
unpopular, perhaps even more unpopular than the Democrats believed.
   Despite the difficulty of this year's tax fight, and the votes'
reaction to it, taxes will probably be an issue both in 1991 and
1992. The sour taste of the 1990 tax debate likely sets the stage
for harder fights over budget cutting in 1991 and 1992. ...

   The Dallas Morning News on William Bennett's legacy:
   The resignation of William Bennett as director of the Office of
National Drug Control Strategy should have the Bush administration
thinking seriously about where it wishes to go from here. Is the
nation to stay the course in aggressively confronting the challenge
of illegal drugs, or is a new approach called for?
   The chorus of voices calling for drug legalization should not
obscure the fact that the nation does appear to have achieved some
success in reducing certain kinds of drug use among certain
segments of the population. Moreover, the price of cocaine is
reportedly down, and the product being sold on the street is said
to be unusually diluted. No one is claiming victory. And whether
Mr. Bennett can take credit for even these limited successes is
open to question. But to shirk from our commitment to an aggressive
two-track policy based on education and law enforcement could
reverse even these few favorable signs.
   The fact is that Mr. Bennett's strength has reposed in his
ability to move national debates forward. ...

   The Times, Trenton, N.J., on the Bush administration's gag order
on abortion information:
   Late last month the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments on a
case in which the verdict ought to be a foregone conclusion.
   At its heart is the Reagan-Bush administration's gag order that
bars government subsidized family planning clinics from giving any
information about abortion to their clients, even in answer to
direct questions.
   It is the Bush administration's intent to block the option (of
abortion) by trampling upon the priceless right of free speech and
the priceless obligation of professional responsibility.
   The court won't find many easier cases than this one. It should
throw those regulations into the Potomac River.

   The Plain Dealer, Cleveland, on the S&amp;L bailout:
   Grim as it is, regulators and taxpayers should keep an eye on
the intricate S&amp;L cleanup process.
   Timely action - including closing down reckless thrifts, selling
off RTC (Resolution Trust Corporation) assets, strengthening the
Bank Insurance Fund and reforming federal deposit insurance - will
save taxpayers money in the long run.
   The voters are already hopping mad about the thrift fiasco.
There is no excuse for Washington's further delay in speeding the
inevitable S&amp;L salvage operation.

   The Atlanta Constitution on the Noriega tapes:
   What poses the real threat to Manuel Antonio Noriega's right to
a fair trial?
   Is it the airing by Cable News Network of a few leaked
recordings of privileged conversations between the ousted
Panamanian dictator and his legal defense team?
   Or is it the bald fact that federal agents taped an unknown
nubmer of telephone discussions involving Noriega and his attorney
and legal staff, and thus may possess important clues as to the
direction his defense strategists will take, clues that a
prosecutor could use, if he were so minded, to parry effectively
his adversary's courtroom thrusts?
   The latter possibility seems a far more plausible menace to a
fair hearing for the accused drug trafficker Noriega than the
off-chance that potential jurors might be swayed by his
conversations as broadcast by CNN. (By the way, one has to wonder
why some official made the tapes available to CNN.)
   The case against Noriega is already burdened with constitutional
issues: the circumstances of his capture and the gathering of
evidence; the release of sensitive documents to the defense; and,
until recently, the freezing of Noriega assets needed to pay for
his defense.
   And now this - the feds poking their noses into a supposedly
inviolate legal communication. It's hard to imagine anything they
might have learned in these conversations that would be worth
taking a gamble with his trial.
   The proceeding, after all, was meant to be a culmination of one
of the objectives President Bush set for the country in invading
Panama last December. It is vital that the case be won. It is no
less vital that the trial be perceived around the world as fair.
   Alas, it's not likely to work out that way. The feds could
hardly have done a better job of jeopardizing the case if they
tried.

   The Houston Post on ocean dumping:
   A quick glance at the globe shows most of the Earth is covered
by water. There seems to be so much of it that it's hard to imagine
that mere humans could make a difference in the vast seas. But
we've been giving it the old college try. ...
   It's time to stop and think about the future and consider the
oceans aren't as limitless as previously thought. Fortunately, the
world's largest industrial nations have reached agreement on a
global ban on dumping industrial waste at sea and moved toward
restricting marine pollution discharged on land.
   At a meeting of the 43 signatory nations to the London Dumping
Convention, a consensus was reached to phase out industrial waste
dumping at sea by 1995. It is legally binding on all the nations
that signed the 20-year-old London treaty, including the United
States, Britain, Germany, France, the Soviet Union and almost all
other industrialized nations. ...
   The international agreement calls for dumping to stop without
increasing pollution in other parts of the environment. Nations are
encouraged to promote cleaner industrial processes, recycling,
treatment of waste on land and more research and development on
environmentally sound means of waste disposal.
   These goals are to be applauded ... the seas must not be turned
into sewers.

   The Independent, London, on the U.S. elections:
   ... American voters ... are against the budget deficit, but do
not want to pay higher taxes. They are against the rich, but not
eager to spend money on the poor. They dislike incumbent
politicians, but are unimpressed by their rivals. They want to be
strong abroad, but are - understandably - hesitant about war.
   If the president could offer clear policies he might get a clear
verdict from the voters. As it is, his indecision has been
reflected in the indecision of the voters. He emerges with less
authority in Congress and therefore in the world.

   Neue Zuercher Zeitung, Zurich, Switzerland, on Iraq's holding of
Western hostages:
   Undoubtedly the Iraqi regime, through a masterfully staged
operation to soften hearts, is intent on diverting the western
public from an initially generally accepted insight and the
resulting willingness for resolute containment of Iraqi arrogance.
   By now every diplomatic step conveying to Saddam the illusion
that his strategy can succeed is a mistake. The Iraqi dictator's
room for maneuver for withdrawing from Kuwait out of political
insight is getting tight now that even Moscow is not explicitly
ruling out the ``force option'' anymore. And for the American
President Bush and the United Nations a military resolution of the
Gulf crisis is becoming increasingly unavoidable as diplomatic

   The Times of India, New Delhi, on Israel and the Palestinians:
   How long can the global community, whose will is expressed
through the U.N., tolerate Israel's adamant refusal to even
consider any move designed to guarantee the security of
Palestinians living in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip?
   ... the U.S. and its Western allies are working to have Iraq
charged with ``war crimes'' in Kuwait. Yet, what Israel is doing to
the Palestinians in the occupied territories is scarcely less
reprehensible. How can the West, much less the U.N., allow double
standards to be applied, to put Iraq in the dock but let Israel go
scot-free?

   Financial Times, London, on world trade talks:
   The Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations stands on
the brink of failure, following the breakdown of talks on farm
reform over the weekend. As expected, proposals by the European
Community, which imply further cuts in support of only some 15
percent between now and 1996, have been roundly rejected by its
partners in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Developing countries, many of which have spent the last decade
liberalizing their own economies at the self-righteous behest of
the industrial world, have a right to feel cruelly deceived by the
EC's grudging attitude ... It would be understandable if farm
exporters such as Argentina concluded there was no further benefit
in carrying on ...
   Washington and Brussels must back away from the self-serving
approach that has nearly brought the Round to disaster. This is not
only dangerous ... It also risks fuelling political instability in
the developing world and Eastern Europe just when global
cooperation is needed to overcome the crisis in the (Persian) gulf.

   The Guardian, Lagos, Nigeria, on France's tying $1.5 billion in
development grants to Africa to democratic reforms:
   This is because, in the view of the French government, democracy
and development are inseparable. In other words, African countries
are being told this: If you want aid for development prepare for
true democracy.
   Fortunately, the values of democracy, such as equality, freedom
and popular participation, are values we should all cherish. And
whoever wants to promote these values cannot be an enemy of the
people. There is indeed some good reason for linking democracy and
development.
   As long as African countries remain minority authoritarian
regimes, aid flowing to them is easily converted into means for
enriching their invariably corrupt elite that exploits the people
and diverts the aid into building up arms with which to suppress
them.

   The Daily Telegraph, London, on the enthronement of Emperor
Akihito of Japan:
   The enthronement ceremony itself, which transforms the emperor
into a living god, marks a partial regression to the era before
Gen. MacArthur compelled Emperor Hirohito to divest himself of the
divine status in the name of which terrible things were done half a
century ago. Greater sensitivity toward the feelings, in
particular, of the countries occupied during Japan's militarist
phase is in order.
   The West, though, should also take these into account when
pressing Japan to send military forces to the (Persian) Gulf. While
a much greater financial contribution toward the Gulf effort is
desirable - as Japan is more dependent on the region for its oil
than any major Western nation - the rejection last week of a
proposal to authorize the deployment of its forces is probably a
healthy acknowledgment of external opinion by Japan's postwar
political system.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev says he fears
bloody social upheaval if he fails in his efforts to reach a
power-sharing agreement with Russian republic President Boris
Yeltsin.
   Gorbachev met Sunday with Yeltsin and pressed him to sign a new
union treaty as a means of preserving the federation of 15
republics, to be renamed ``The Union of Sovereign Republics.''
   ``The Union of Sovereign Republics, to use the military idiom,
is the last trench line,'' Gorbachev told senior military officers
at a Kremlin meeting on Tuesday.
   ``The disintegration of the state begins beyond,'' he said in
remarks quoted by the official news agency Tass. Dissolution of the
Soviet Union ``could turn into a bloodbath,'' Tass paraphrased him
as saying.
   ``A situation may arise that will be worse than during the
Cultural Revolution in China,'' Gorbachev said, referring to the
tumultuous final decade of Mao Tse-tung in China from 1966-76,
according to Tass.
   Mao's attempt to revive revolutionary fervor in China sparked a
violent struggle for power. An estimated 1 million people died.
   
   Gorbachev made a similar comment in March, grappling with a
crisis over Baltic separatism and facing a Russian parliamentary
election that eventually put Yeltsin in power of the country's
largest and most populous republic.
   Gorbachev and Yeltsin met for five hours on Sunday in a major
initiative to end the paralysis of power in the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev confirmed Yeltsin's statement that the two had set up
commissions to decide how to divide authority between the central
Soviet government and the Russian government, which has emerged as
an independent force since Yeltsin was elected its president in
June.
   The Soviet and Russian commissions will work while
representatives of the 15 republics try to negotiate a new union
treaty to replace the 1924 charter that forms the basis of the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
   Despite the agreement between Gorbachev and Yeltsin on the need
to compromise, the two leaders seem to differ on whether to first
conclude the union treaty or to define the respective powers of
their rival governments.
   Yeltsin, addressing the Russian legislature on Tuesday, said
that during Sunday's meeting, the Soviet leader ``insisted on
rushing quickly through'' completion of a union treaty, ``and that
Russia should play a great consolidating role in the process of
signing a new union treaty.
   But Yeltsin said he insisted that Gorbachev respect the
sovereignty of the Russian republic. He said he would sign such a
treaty only after the central government and republics had
carefully defined their powers.
   Russia, which contains more than half the Soviet Union's 287
million people and is rich in natural resources, holds a de facto
veto over many of Gorbachev's decisions.
   In recent months, Gorbachev and Yeltsin and their respective
parliaments have issued conflicting decrees and laws that have
complicated even simple transactions. That in turn has worsened an
already dire shortage of food and consumer goods at the outset of
winter.
   Yeltsin said the commissions appointed by the two leaders ``must
clearly define the functions of the governments.''
   He said the panels will cover ``division of property, the use of
the natural wealth, (use of) foreign currency, debts, financial
resources, tax policies, the banking system, on the role of the
banks, and the independence of foreign economic trade by Russia,
preparation and implementation of convertibility of the ruble, the
budget of 1991.''
   He said Gorbachev agreed to cede to Russia some elements of the
KGB security police, to give the Russian government a voice in
military reforms, and to share millions of dollars the German
government is paying Moscow to aid the repatriation of Soviet
troops.

<TEXT>
   After nearly five years out of office, former
Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine is a more dominant national
figure now than when he stormed out of Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet.
   That reflects both a flair for the dramatic and the patience to
wait for the prime minister to stumble.
   Tall and handsome with flowing blond hair and piercing blue
eyes, the 57-year-old Heseltine is a self-made millionaire who
doesn't quite fit any faction of the governing Conservative Party.
   To admirers in the party, Heseltine looks like a savior.
   Critics accuse him of volatility and showmanship. As his
challenge to her leadership loomed, Thatcher aides commented, ``all
glamour and no substance.''
   He has carried the nickname of ``Tarzan'' since 1976 when he
grabbed the heavy ceremonial mace in the House of Commons and swung
it over his head at Labor Party left-wingers who were singing their
anthem, ``The Red Flag.''
   As defense secretary from 1983 to 1986 at the height of the
propaganda battle over the deployment of U.S. nuclear missiles in
Britain, Heseltine donned a flak jacket for a confrontation with
anti-nuclear protesters at a missile base.
   Politically, he's dead center in the party while Mrs. Thatcher
stands well to the right. But many on the Tory left distrust him
for views that include enthusiasm for a program in the United
States that requires unemployed to work for welfare.
   He calls his political philosophy ``caring capitalism'' that
contrasts with the free-market stance of Thatcherism.
   ``For any democratic government, the challenge is to take people
a little further than they can go by themselves,'' he once wrote.
``And when need be, to show that compassion for which the
marketplace makes no allowance.''
   Michael Jones, political editor of London's conservative Sunday
Times, wrote of Heseltine: ``He has the trick of making Tory
supporters feel good about themselves, of making them feel that
capitalism can have a moral base.''
   While a member of Mrs. Thatcher's government, Heseltine was the
golden boy and seemed destined for bigger things.
   The rift came in 1986 in a dispute over the buy-out of the
financially troubled British helicopter manufacturer Westland PLC.
Heseltine, always pro-Europe, favored a European consortium while
Mrs. Thatcher favored the U.S. corporation Sikorsky.
   To the surprise of nearly everyone, Heseltine stood up in the
middle of a Cabinet meeting in January 1986 and walked out.
   ``Of course I miss it hugely,'' he mused earlier this year of
his long exile from government. ``I regretted profoundly the need
to leave the Cabinet, but I have never had any doubts that it was
the right thing to do.''
   Most other casualties of the Thatcher Cabinets have fallen into
political obscurity.
   But Heseltine conducted a patient campaign of a leader in
waiting. He has swept around the country addressing party meetings
- an average of five a week -opening fetes, spreading goodwill and
glamour and assiduously avoiding direct criticism of Mrs. Thatcher.
   Subtle criticisms, however, were always there, particularly
about her combative stance against the European Community and a
controversial new local government tax, the so-called poll tax.
   Michael Ray Dibdin Heseltine was born March 21, 1933, into a
middle-class Welsh family. His father was a structural engineer and
part-time army colonel.
   As an undergraduate at Oxford, Heseltine mapped out his
ambitions: to make a fortune in business and become prime minister.
   Starting with a 1,000-pound legacy from his grandfather, he made
one fortune in property and then another in magazine publishing.
   He and his wife, Anne, who have two daughters and a son, live in
considerable style: a magnificent period house in London's
Belgravia district and a country mansion where he has planted 2,500
species of trees and shrubs. It also has a lake for his lifelong
hobby of bird-watching.
   ``I haven't been driven by money,'' Heseltine once said. ``I saw
money as an important part of the process of being independent -
and in enabling me to pursue a political career.''
   After two unsuccessful attempts, he was elected to Parliament in
1966. He got his first government job as minister of aerospace in
1972 in Edward Heath's Conservative government.
   Mrs. Thatcher appointed him to her first Cabinet as environment
secretary when she won power in 1979 and then defense secretary.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland and Germany today formally settled
one of the last disputes of World War II, signing a treaty
confirming their long-questioned border on the Oder and Neisse
rivers.
   In the pact, Germany abandons claim to 40,000 square miles of
its former territory in East Prussia, Pomerania and Silesia that
was added to Poland after the war. The land Poland gained from
Germany made up for a much greater expanse of land in the east
taken from Poland by the Soviet Union.
   The formerly German lands account for about one-third of Poland
today.
   The treaty commits the countries to building ``a peaceful
European order, in which borders will not divide and which ... will
ensure permanent peace, freedom and stability.''
   The pact was signed by Foreign Ministers Hans-Dietrich Genscher
of Germany and Krzysztof Skubiszewski of Poland at the Council of
Ministers building, seat of the Polish government.
   Skubiszewski said ``both nations should congratulate
themselves'' for closing a difficult chapter in their histories.
   Genscher said the loss of German lands confirmed by the pact was
the fault of the ``criminal system'' in Germany during World War
II.
   In a speech after the signing, he called the treaty ``a decisive
step between both our countries and for the future of Europe, a
step of historical dimension.''
   He said the pact shows the newly united Germany's will to
establish a firm basis of friendship with Poland.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and his assembled Cabinet
stood by as the two-page document was signed. Final agreement on
the treaty was reached at a border meeting Thursday between
Mazowiecki and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Mazowiecki made what appeared to be Poland's strongest statement
of apology to the Germans for the loss of their lands.
   ``We ask for forgiveness,'' he said. ``The suffering of the
German nation must be spoken about. ... Every harm remains a harm,
every tragedy remains a tragedy, irrespective of the harms and
tragedies that we ourselves experienced.''
   Winning unequivocal German acceptance of the border has been one
of Poland's chief foreign policy goals.
   Genscher expressed sympathy for the millions of Germans who lost
homes that fell within the new Polish borders after the war.
   ``The decision we have made ... is not an easy one for us
Germans, for none of us, for me neither. And for those who have
lost their home lands, who suffered expulsion, it is an especially
painful one,'' he said.
   The treaty signing is seen as a boost for Mazowiecki, engaged in
an uphill campaign for president against Solidarity Chairman Lech
Walesa.
   Genscher was to meet with both Mazowiecki and Walesa during his
one-day visit, as well as with outgoing President Wojciech
Jaruzelski and Cardinal Jozef Glemp, leader of Poland's powerful
Roman Catholic Church.
   Stalin urged the border on the Oder and Neisse rivers at Potsdam
in 1945, and Britain and the United States accepted. By that time,
the Soviets had installed an obedient government in Poland and were
occupying eastern Germany.
   As a result, millions of Germans fled or were roughly expelled
from lands that had been home to German speakers for centuries. In
their stead came millions more Poles from the east, whose former
homes had fallen within the expanded borders of the Soviet Union.
   By insisting the border be moved so deeply into former German
territory, Stalin partly compensated the Poles for his own land
seizures, punished Germany for the war and bound Poland to Moscow
as the ultimate guarantor of its western frontier.
   Communist East Germany recognized the Oder-Neisse line in 1950
and West Germany disavowed any territorial claims in 1970, but
conservatives and politically influential associations of those
expelled from German land pressed for decades to regain all or part
of Germany's lost territories.
   Under the timetable agreed to by Kohl and Mazowiecki, the border
treaty will be ratified by the end of February by parliaments of
both countries.
   At the same time, a broader friendship treaty is to be ready for
ratification too. Among other things, that pact will contain
assurances of minority rights for the up to 1 million ethnic
Germans still living in Poland.

<HEAD>ANC Urges Land Redistribution, Compensation to Dispossessed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TINA SUSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The African National Congress
today called for urgent land redistribution to end the white
domination of property and to restore land that blacks lost under
apartheid laws.
   In its first comprehensive report on a future land policy, the
group said that nationalizing property was one of several options
for reaching a more equitable distribution of land.
   ``In the context of a mixed economy, there would only be
selective nationalization, and ... the distribution of this land
would be based on land-use needs,'' the report said.
   It said landowners in those cases would be compensated in cash
and bonds.
   But the report also said compensation would be ``due from
present owners on the basis of the benefits they have received
(from the land) to those (blacks) who were dispossessed.''
   The 20-page report was based on discussions last month of the
ANC's Land Commission Workshop.
   Whites make up about 16 percent of the population of South
Africa but own 87 percent of the land. The imbalance in land
ownership is becoming a major issue as the government and black
opposition groups move closer to negotiations on a new constitution
to give blacks a share of power.
   President F.W. de Klerk has promised to end apartheid and repeal
decades-old land laws that forced millions of blacks into
designated townships and rural tribal homelands. Blacks are able to
own property in the townships and homelands.
   White landowners, and farmers in particular, have expressed
fears that they could lose their property under a black government.
   According to the ANC report, workshop delegates envisioned a
system of ``one person, one farm'' in a future South Africa and
agreed that the state should play the principal role in
redistribution of land.
   A land commission is needed to oversee land claims, and an
affirmative action program is needed to help blacks once they have
acquired property, the report said.
   Priority would be given to acquiring land claimed by entire
communities, it said, and factors to be considered would include
whether the land had been neglected or underutilized.
   Those people who lose their land under such a plan should be
paid 25 percent cash; 25 percent in 10-year government bonds; and
50 percent in industrial bonds, it said.

<HEAD>Policeman Says He Grabbed Gunman's Rifle As He Aimed At Leaders</HEAD>

   A policeman said today he grabbed the barrel of a
hunting rifle as a marcher in a parade aimed it in the direction of
Soviet leaders watching Revolution Day ceremonies in Red Square
earlier this month.
   Up until now, official reports on the Nov. 7 incident had not
said what the gunman's target was.
   But the policeman, Sgt. Andrei Mylnikov, said the gunman was
aiming at the reviewing stand atop the Lenin Mausoleum where Soviet
leaders, including President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, were standing.
   Mylnikov said he was three yards away when the man pulled the
rifle from under his coat.
   He rushed the gunman and forced the gun barrel into the air just
before he fired, the official Tass news agency quoted the policeman
as telling a news conference.
   ``I ran up to him and, snatching the hunting gun barrel with
both hands, sharply raised it upwards,'' Mylnikov said. ``At that
time, the first shot was fired.''
   Although he said the gun was aimed at the reviewing stand, he
did not say whether the gunman seemed to be trying to hit a
specific leader.
   Mylinkov said a second shot was fired over the heads of police
guarding the square, but by then they had enough warning from the
commotion to ``bend down or fall to the ground,'' he said.
   ``After that, the gunman was apprehended,'' he said. ``I
snatched the gun from his hands.''
   About 20 plainclothes police seized Alexander A. Shmonov, 38, an
unemployed worker from Leningrad, and bundled him off to the GUM
department store across the square from Gorbachev.
   He has been charged with ``attempted terrorism,'' and Tass said
today he was being held in a KGB ``investigating isolation ward.''
   Tass quoted KGB investigator Pyotr Sokolov as saying Shmonov's
actions amounted to ``an attempt to commit a terrorist act.''
   The gunman had been standing about 80 yards from the official
reviewing stand. He was marching in a delegation from the Bauman
region of Moscow during a pro-Communist demonstration.
   No one was hurt in the shootings, which came during an otherwise
peaceful marking of the 73rd anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik
Revolution.
   The shooting occurred five minutes after Gorbachev, Russian
Federation President Boris Yeltsin and other officials returned to
the mausoleum after marching with the demonstrators.

<HEAD>Police Drive Leftists From Mainzer Strasse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three thousand police fired tear gas and water
cannons today during a successful five-hour battle to drive
hundreds of leftist radicals from a dozen rundown tenements in
eastern Berlin.
   Police and a special paramilitary unit used armored personnel
carriers and bulldozers to break down barricades erected by the
leftists. Hundreds of squatters living on Mainzer Strasse responded
with firebombs and rocks.
   It was the third consecutive day of clashes on the street this
week.
   ZDF television said several police officers were injured, but
there was no immediate word on injuries among the squatters. ZDF
said 135 people were arrested.
   Police raided Mainzer Strasse and adjoining blocks at 7 a.m. and
battled for control for about five hours before driving the
squatters from the ramshackle tenements splashed wtih slogans and
signs, including ``Eat the rich.''
   Berlin Interior Minister Erich Paetzold said today's clash was
marked by ``unbelievable brutality'' from the radicals.
   Late Monday night and Tuesday morning, leftists battled with
police for nearly 10 hours on Mainzer Strasse. About 137 police
were injured and 20 people were arrested in those clashes.
   Fighting began Monday on Mainzer Strasse after police began
evicting leftist radicals from houses in other parts of the city.
The leftists say they have a right to the abandoned homes and have
mobilized their supporters to resist police action.
   Police spokesman Werner Thronicker said Mainzer Strasse is
headquarters for people responsible for ``serious criminal acts.''
   Anarchists from the former West Berlin have taken over about 12
tenement buildings on the block in recent months and several houses
elsewhere in eastern Berlin.
   While East Germany's democratic government did little to evict
the squatters, officials have begun cracking down since German
unification Oct. 3.
   The clashes have drawn new attention to the shortage of
affordable housing in Berlin and other German cities. The situation
is expected to be particularly acute in eastern Berlin, where many
residents still pay relatively low rents.
   Under the former Communist system, rents were heavily subsidized
by the government. They are to begin rising in January.

<HEAD>Australian Company to Test Koala Springs Product</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The manufacturer of Koala Springs
juice-flavored mineral water is testing its domestic product after
small traces of benzene were found in its U.S. stocks.
   Koala Springs International has recalled its drinks from stores
in the United States and eastern Canada following the discovery of
traces of the toxic chemical, the same substance that forced
Perrier to recall millions of bottles in February.
   Koala Springs said laboratory tests are being conducted in
Australia on fruit concentrate used in its American-bottled
product, and on locally bottled fruit mineral water.
   Tested as recently as June, Australian-bottled mineral water
supplies had shown no traces of benzene, but further tests are
being verified by the Australian Government Analytical
Laboratories, the company said.
   Benzene is a naturally occurring chemical used in solvents.
   ``We have no thoughts of withdrawing our product until the
results of the Australian tests are known,'' a company spokesman
said today.
   The results of the government test would not be known for at
least a week.
   Containers used to ship concentrates to the United States would
also be tested, the company said.
   Benzene forced a recall this year for French mineral water giant
Perrier. The company withdrew 160 million bottles worldwide,
includine 72 million bottles in the United States and Canada.
   Perrier officials said benzene entered their water in trace
amounts when workers failed to change a pipe filter at the
company's natural spring at Vergeze in southern France.
   Koala Springs was originally exported bottled to the United
States. But as its market grew it established links with contract
bottling plants.
   John Chatham, president of Koala Springs International, said the
company had recalled hundreds of thousands of bottles and cans of
its product in the United States.
   ``We are taking this action willingly and voluntarily to protect
our product and its good name,'' he said from the company's U.S.
headquarters in Fremont, Calif.
   The move came after the Florida Health Department found samples
with 11 to 18 parts per billion of benzene. That level does not
pose a significant health risk but it exceeds the one part per
billion allowed for bottled water under Florida law, a state health
officer said.
   Last year, the company reported $152 million in worldwide sales,
including $60 million in the United States.

scholarly retrospective of Boston barroom comedy, got the highest
ratings of any prime-time show this season.
   The hourlong NBC special, moderated by talk show host John
McLaughlin, was seen in nearly 27.5 million homes last week,
receiving a 29.5 rating and a 44 share, the A.C. Nielsen Co.
reported Tuesday.
   A rating point equals 931,000 households with television. A
share is the percentage of TV sets in use that are tuned to a show
in its time period.
   ``One fourth of all women 25 to 54 in the country watched the
show,'' said David Marans, a senior analyst for the J. Walter
Thompson advertising agency.
   ``To put that in perspective, the No. 2 show for that group was
`Roseanne,' which got a 17.0 (rating), - or one out of every seven
women.''
   Overall, NBC led with a 13.7 average rating and a 22 share. ABC
edged CBS for second place by eight-tenths of a rating point, or
about 745,000 TV homes, with a 12.8 rating and a 21 share; CBS had
a 12.0 rating and a 20 share.
   NBC said ``Cheers'' has been the No. 1 show for six of the
season's eight weeks. Thursday's rating also was the highest for
any comedy series since ``The Cosby Show'' hit a 29.8 rating and 45
share on Jan. 12, 1989, the network said.
   The all-time ratings champ is CBS' last episode of ``M-A-S-H''
in 1983. Seen in nearly 50.5 million homes, it averaged a 77
percent share of the auidence in its time period, compared to 44
percent for ``Cheers'' on Thursday.
   ABC's ``Twin Peaks,'' the eccentric nighttime soap opera about
the murky goings-on in a Pacific Northwest logging town, also got a
boost in the ratings by at last revealing the killer of troubled
homecoming queen Laura Palmer.
   ``Twin Peaks'' got a 10.4 rating and a 20 share by revealing
that Leland Palmer, Laura's father, apparently killed her while
possessed by the shadowy, demonic killer known only as ``Bob.'' The
week before, ``Twin Peaks'' had a 7.9 rating and a 16 share.
   In the evening news ratings, ABC won for the 44th consecutive
week with an 11.6 rating; CBS had a 10.1, NBC a 9.7.
   Following ``Cheers'' in prime time's top 10 were CBS' ``60
Minutes,'' with a 21.5 rating; ``A Different World,'' NBC, 20.0;
and ``Designing Women'' on CBS tied CBS' ``Murphy Brown'' for
fourth place with an 18.9.
   ``Empty Nest'' on NBC was sixth with an 18.6; ABC's ``America's
Funniest Home Videos'' and ``Roseanne'' tied for seventh with an
18.5; No. 9 was CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote'' with an 18.4, and NBC's
``Unsolved Mysteries'' was 10th with a 16.2.

   U.S. intelligence recruited hundreds of
guerrillas and laid weapons caches across Western Europe during the
early days of Cold War as part of preparations for a feared Soviet
invasion, a newspaper reported today.
   Only recently was the would-be resistance network disbanded, and
several former high-ranking European officials say some of its
hidden stockpiles of arms and explosives still existed just two
months ago.
   The top secret organization, brought to light last month in
Italy and codenamed Gladio there after the short swords used by
Roman gladiators, is now under investigation for possible links to
right-wing terrorism.
   The network is said to have had branches in Italy, Germany,
France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Austria, Spain,
Greece and Portugal. The respected German newspaper Die Welt said
today that even neutral Sweden and Switzerland took part.
   Sweden's TT news agency today quoted former CIA Director William
Colby as saying that he organized an armed anti-Communist movement
in a Scandinavian country during the 1950s, when he was based in
Sweden.
   ``It cannot surprise anyone that such movements, networks, were
organized in Western Europe to attack Communist occupation
forces,'' Colby was quoted as telling TT.
   He was interviewed by phone at his Pebble Beach, Calif. home. He
refused to name the Scandinavian country in which he organized a
resistance movement.
   Die Welt said that soon after World War II, U.S. agents worked
with intelligence agencies of ``various European countries'' in
setting up the network and training natives as guerrilla fighters.
The newspaper did not name its sources.
   ``Training centers sprang up'' in forests in the U.S.-occupied
part of Germany, said Die Welt.
   At the centers, said the newspaper, ``former prisoners of war,
men who had done civilian work for the occupying powers, and young
men acquired by chance were trained in pistol-shooting, radio
operations and tactics.''
   Pistols, grenade-launchers, explosives and radios were stored in
secret caches to be used by the guerrillas, said Die Welt.
   ``The network was expanded to all of Western Europe by 1959,''
said Die Welt. ``Money was provided by intelligence agencies.''
   The operation was designed to be an underground resistance
network in case of a Soviet invasion in Western Europe. It mostly
prepared communication networks, escape routes and sabotage plans,
officials have said.
   Die Welt said the network's controlling body still exists in
Belgium, thought only as a ``shell.''
   In 1951, said Die Welt, allied intelligence agencies and each
participating nation - Germany, Italy and France being among the
first - agreed to set up a Clandestine Committee for Planning to
oversee the network.
   Headquarters were initially in France, said the newspaper.
   The controlling body's name was changed to Allied Clandestine
Committee in 1964, said Die Welt.
   The newspaper said that in the 1950s the network began
``systematic cooperation'' with the Brussels-based Supreme
Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, which worked with the group in
maneuvers.
   The network was independent of NATO's control, said Die Welt.
   German officials were not immediately available for comment.
   In Paris, French President Francois Mitterrand on Tuesday
confirmed that he had dissolved the French arm of the group but did
not say when. He was first elected in 1981.
   ``I didn't have much left to dissolve,'' Mitterrand said.
``There only remained a few remnants, of which I learned the
existence with some surprise because everyone had forgotten about
them.''
   The Paris newspaper Liberation said the French arm of the
network was disbanded only after disclosures of the Italian
operation had created a political controversy.
   Henk Vredeling, the Dutch defense minister from 1973-77, said he
had been told about the existence of Gladio weapons caches on Dutch
soil.
   One dump discovered in 1980 could supply a force of up to 150
men and enough explosives to destroy buildings and bridges, reports
said.
   In Belgium, a former Gladio member and former Belgian army
intelligence official, Andre Moyen, told the leftist newspaper Le
Drapeau Rouge he knew of ``at least six arms caches'' hidden in
Belgium up to two months ago.
   A former Belgian defense minister, Francois-Xavier de Donnea,
said Gladio ``exercises were scrapped, perhaps as long as one or
two years ago.'' During his 1985-1988 tenure, he said he was
briefed on Gladio operations.
   Belgium is investigating links between the local branch and
indiscriminate killings in supermarkets during the early 1980s that
left at least 28 people dead. The murders have been linked by
authorities to right-wing terrorism.
   Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti last month revealed the
existence of Gladio, which he said had more than 600 members in his
country.
   The operation caused controversy in Italy because of unconfirmed
statements that the network might have been behind right-wing
terrorist attacks in the early 1970s to keep Communists out of
power.
   Venice Investigating Magistrate Felice Casson, a specialist in
terrorism, discovered the existence of Gladio during a probe of a
right-wing terrorist attack and has asked President Francesco
Cossiga to testify about the group.
   In Greece, where the anti-Communist network was known as
Sheepskin, caches with arms, ammunition, torches and other
equipment were dug up between 1985 and 1988, when the network was
dismantled.

   The leading man of ``Shogun'' was injured by a
large piece of falling scenery as he was about to sing ``Death
Walk'' at a preview performance of the new Broadway musical.
   Philip Casnoff was listed in stable condition today at St.
Vincent's Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Gina Gabriel.
   Tuesday's performance was canceled as actors, crew members and a
doctor in the audience rushed to aid the injured actor.
   It was not known this morning if a preview peformance would be
held tonight, or if the show would open on Thursday, as scheduled.
   Casnoff, 33, was about to sing a song called ``Death Walk,'' in
the second act when an electric spark flashed and a prop, a large
overhead screen, came crashing down, said Sam Rudy, a spokesman for
the show.
   The screen struck Casnoff on the side of the head and then it
tumbled into the orchestra pit. Casnoff was the only person
injured.
   The actor suffered minor injuries to the face and neck, said
Emergency Medical Service spokesman Capt. Edward Gabriel.
   ``He's going to be all right,'' Rudy said.
   The show is a musical rendition of James Clavell's best-selling
novel and television miniseries. Casnoff plays a 17th century
English sailor shipwrecked in Japan.

   A small bag of white powder found
under a desk in the space shuttle hangar was not cocaine as
originally believed, NASA said today.
   An initial analysis by NASA indicated the substance found in the
building where shuttles are prepared for launch was cocaine.
   An investigation was opened by security officers from NASA and
the contractors responsible for shuttle preparations and security
at the Kennedy Space Center.
   But a subsequent test by state officials proved it was not
cocaine, said NASA spokesman Karl Kristofferson. NASA conducted
another test that identified the substance as calcium hydrogen
phosphate, which is used in high school chemistry kits.
   Kristofferson said officials did not know how the bag got into
the hangar.

<HEAD>First City Elections Called in 11 Years in Punjab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Punjab state government said today
that municipal elections will be held there next month for the
first time since 1979, when they were halted because of militarism
by Sikhs.
   The elections could be a first step toward restoring local
control over the wealthy farming state bordering Pakistan, where
some Sikhs have been fighting for independence.
   Also today, police said Moslems and Sikhs rampaged through a
predominantly Hindu neighborhood of New Delhi, setting fire to
shops, homes and vehicles and killing two Hindu men.
   Santosh K. Kain, a police commissioner, said at least 17 people
were hospitalized. He said two Hindus were stabbed to death, three
Hindu-owned shops and homes were set ablaze, and about 10 vehicles
were set on fire. Police used gunfire, tear gas and truncheons to
put down the riot, Kain said.
   More than 380 people, mostly Moslems, have been killed in riots
across India in the past three weeks. The violence was caused by a
Hindu campaign to replace a mosque with a temple in Ayodhya in
northeastern India.
   Punjab state governor Virendra Verma, who was appointed by
federal authorities, said elections would be held in three cities
and 95 towns on Dec. 22 and 23, Press Trust of India reported from
Chandigarh, the state capital.
   Chandra Shekhar, India's new prime minister, has said he expects
to hold state government elections within five months.
   Punjab's state assembly was dismissed in 1986 when it lost
control of Sikh militants, and the federal government took direct
control. Federal control has been extended every six months and can
remain in force until May.
   No municipal elections have been held in Punjab since 1979. All
the city councils were dismissed in 1985.
   The announcement of elections came in spite of increased
violence this year. More than 2,750 people have been killed by
militants.
   Hindus comprise 82 percent of India's 880 million people.
Moslems make up 12 percent, while Sikhs are 2 percent. Sikhs are in
the majority in Punjab.

<HEAD>Burma's Leader Says Dissident Committed Suicide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRUNNSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burma's military leader said in a
speech broadcast today that a dissident who died in custody last
week committed suicide, and was not tortured to death.
   Maung Ko, 52, an influential organizer of the opposition
National League for Democracy, died in military custody on Friday
while a U.N. human rights investigator was visiting the country.
   Political sources contacted in Rangoon said Tuesday on condition
of anonymity that Maung Ko's relatives believe he died of torture.
   ``We did make necessary interrogations, but there was no reason
for us to kill him,'' the head of the military government, Gen. Saw
Maung, said in a speech broadcast on Burmese state television. He
spoke on Tuesday.
   Maung Ko's death coincided with a visit to Burma by Sadako
Ogata, a Japanese human rights expert who was looking into
allegations of widespread abuse by the government. She left Burma
on Sunday and is to report back to the U.N. Human Rights Commission
in Geneva.
   Saw Maung denied his government used torture. He said a report
he had received from the head of the military intelligence, Maj.
Gen. Khin Nyunt, said Maung Ko, ``after confessing what they did
and what their plans were, made use of a blanket there and hanged
himself.''
   ``This happened because of his own problems. Let me say it here
today it did not happen because of our doing,'' he said.
   Khin Nyunt's Directorate of Defense Services Intelligence was
cited by Amnesty International last week as the agency most widely
blamed for torturing dissidents.
   The political sources said Maung Ko was arrested late last month
and detained at a military intelligence center near Rangoon
airport, where he died.
   Relatives and colleagues who attended Maung Ko's funeral in
Rangoon on Sunday said his body was heavily bruised around the
face, neck and body and there was blood around the mouth and
ankles. They did not believe the suicide report, the sources said.
   ``On sheer personality grounds they found it difficult to
believe. He was not the sort of person who would give up,'' one of
the sources said.
   Maung Ko headed the league's workers wing and was a close
associate of its general secretary, Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been
under house arrest since July 1989.
   The league won the May 27 elections by a landslide but the
government has refused to hand over power.
   The government came to power in 1988 after troops killed
thousands of people to crush a mass movement for democracy.
   The political sources said death in detention from torture was
not uncommon and often the government did not return victims'
bodies to their relatives. It was unclear why they did so this
time, they said.
   ``It may be because he was such a senior person, or that they
felt they had nothing to hide. Or they may have done it to make an
example of him,'' one said.
   The sources said the government had arrested at least 50 senior
league members in its latest clampdown that began with raids on
Buddhist monasteries last month. They said up to 200 monks also
were detained.

<HEAD>Day After Rod Removed From Heart, 8-Year-Old Asks to Play Nintendo</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, `Justin was...', to explain that other veins

<TEXT>
   Surgeons unscrewed a steel rod from a brave
8-year-old impaled through the heart in a fall from a roof.
   Justin Stiner asked for some ice and wanted to play Nintendo on
Tuesday after waking up from surgery, doctors said.
   ``He probably just thinks this is kind of a slight inconvenience
in his life,'' said trauma surgeon Dr. Michael Esser.
   The 4-foot-long, {-inch-thick threaded bar used to reinforce
concrete was literally unscrewed from the boy's neck and torso
Monday in a 2{-hour operation at University Medical Center.
Eighteen inches of the rod had penetrated his body.
   Justin was listed in critical condition. Esser said the heart
wounds should heal fully, and although the boy's severed jugular
vein was tied off, other veins can provide the needed circulation.
The jugular vein carries blood back from the head to the heart.
   The 4-foot-10, 86-pound third-grader from Sierra Vista fell onto
the rod while playing with friends on the roof of a house Monday
morning.
   He was suspended two feet off the ground for about 20 minutes,
alert the whole time, while paramedics cut the rod, which pierced
him just below the breastbone.
   Justin, who was taken the 80 miles from Sierra Vista to Tucson
by helicopter, neither panicked or screamed, and on arrival
``wanted to know if I was going to remove it. He was very
cooperative,'' Dr. Phillip Richemont said.
   Esser and Richemont said the rod went through the right side of
the heart, which has about one-third the pressure of the left side.
   ``He would have bled to death'' if it had been on the left side,
Esser said. ``He's one lucky kid. It just didn't hit any arterial
structures.''
   Richemont said surgeons were stunned to find that the rod had
pierced the heart in two places and divided the jugular vein. ``But
yet it didn't bleed. It's amazing,'' Richemont said, calling it a
one-in-a-million occurrence.
   During the operation, the heart seemingly ``contracted down
between the threads,'' cutting off bleeding, Richemont said.
   The outcome, Esser said, ``makes us feel good. We have a lot
that don't make it.''

<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) - A jury today convicted a woman in the
arsenic-poisoning death of a former boyfriend. She is also accused
of poisoning her first husband and trying to kill her present
spouse.
   Blanche Taylor Moore, 57, showed no visible reaction when the
murder verdict was read. The sons of victim Raymond Reid, who died
in 1986, hugged and one cried.
   A sentencing hearing for Mrs. Moore was scheduled Thursday and
prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty.
   Prosecutors said during the four-week trial that Mrs. Moore was
driven by a need for money and that she killed Reid to gain part of
his estate.
   The jury began deliberations Tuesday and the verdict was
returned shortly after 10 a.m. today.
   Mrs. Moore also is charged with murder in the poisoning of her
first husband, James Taylor, in 1973, and with assault for
allegedly trying to kill her estranged husband, the Rev. Dwight
Moore, after their honeymoon last year. No trial dates have been
set on those charges.
   Mrs. Moore testified last week that she is innocent and she
lovingly cared for the three men.
   ``I know arsenic was found in these three people, but I know
that I didn't do it,'' she testified last week. ``I've never
physically harmed other people. To physically harm a person, no, I
did not do that.''
   Officials exhumed five bodies while investigating the case,
including those of Mrs. Moore's father, Taylor's mother and a
former co-worker of Mrs. Moore's. They found arsenic in the remains
of Mrs. Moore's father, Parker D. Kiser Sr., but she was not
charged in connection with his death.
   Officials began investigating Reid's death after Moore's arsenic
poisoning was discovered by doctors last year.
   Prosecutor Janet Branch said 53 witnesses supported the state's
contention that Mrs. Moore fed home-cooked food to Reid while he
was hospitalized at North Carolina Baptist Hospital in
Winston-Salem. Prosecution witnesses also testified that Mrs. Moore
sought to buy Anti-Ant, an insect poison.
   Mrs. Moore testified that she never sought the poison, never
owned any of it and never fed Reid home-cooked food in the
hospital.
   Defense attorneys tried to lay the blame for the deaths upon an
acquaintance of Mrs. Moore's, Garvin Thomas. They produced a
rambling, five-page letter in which he allegedly confessed to the
crimes. Thomas died before the letter arrived at Mrs. Moore's jail
cell.
   Handwriting experts differed on whether Mrs. Moore or Thomas
could have penned the letter.

   Seven new cases of St. Louis
encephalitis have brought the state's number of confirmed cases to
101, but a state official said an end to the outbreak is in sight.
   An additional 45 people are on a ``presumptive'' list, meaning
they've tested positive in the first of two tests necessary to
verify that they have the mosquito-borne viral illness.
   ``We're on that trail where we're going to reach the end of this
thing,'' said David Adams, a spokesman for the state Department of
Health and Rehabilitative Services.
   Counts are down in mosquito traps in many counties and colder
weather next month should reduce the numbers further, Adams said
Tuesday.
   So far, six deaths have been attributed to the flu-like illness,
which can turn fatal with brain inflammation. The youngest to die
was 58.
   The typical death rate in an outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis
is 7 percent. Eight deaths were reported in the last major
outbreak, in 1977. Confirmed and presumptive cases then totaled
only 110, significantly below the 146 combined cases reported this
year since mid-August.
   Florida typically has one to five cases of St. Louis
encephalitis each year and an outbreak every 10 years or so, Adams
said.

   Challenged by congressional leaders over its new war footing,
the Bush administration has begun to emphasize that American jobs
could be at risk if Saddam Hussein is allowed to maintain his grip
on Kuwait.
   Iraq today stepped up its accusations that the United States is
preparing to attack. It denounced a plan by U.S. Marines to hold
amphibious assault exercises in Saudi Arabia, calling it a ``clear
act of provocation.''
   Meanwhile, President Bush told Congress today he was extending
for an additional 90 days the 90-day call-up for reservists already
serving in the Persian Gulf region, and the United States pressed
Japan to toughen its stance in the gulf crisis.
   In a setback for Arab diplomatic efforts, Saudi Arabia suggested
it would probably not take part in a proposed Arab summit until
Iraq pledged to pull out of Kuwait.
   The Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, said any Arab
meetings ``will bear no fruit'' unless Iraq promises to adhere to
the resolutions of the emergency Arab summit held in August and of
the United Nations.
   King Hassan II of Morocco has proposed an emergency Arab summit
to work out an Arab solution to the Persian Gulf crisis and avert
war over Iraq's refusal to quit Kuwait, which it seized Aug. 2.
   The Saudi foreign minister's statement came on his arrival today
in the United Arab Emirates, where he met with President Sheik
Zayed bin Sultan al Nahyan. The remarks were distributed by the
official Emirates news agency, WAM.
   The Iraqis say Saddam would consider attending the summit if he
was consulted on the time and place and if the Palestinian issue is
on the agenda.
   Bush was meeting at the White House today with a select group of
lawmakers to try to bolster support for his gulf policy. Secretary
of State James A. Baker III set the stage with comments a day
earlier linking the economy and the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``The economic lifeline of the industrial world runs from the
gulf, and we cannot permit a dictator such as this to sit astride
that economic lifeline,'' he said. ``To bring it down to the level
of the average American citizen, let me say that means jobs.''
   Baker suggested that a worldwide economic recession could result
if Saddam is not checked and the security of gulf oil reserves
ensured.
   He spoke after meeting in Bermuda with Canada's external affairs
minister, Joe Clark, who voiced support for a U.S.-sponsored United
Nations resolution authorizing the use of military force to drive
Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
   The call for greater Japanese support for the anti-Iraq
coalition came from Vice President Dan Quayle, who met in Tokyo
with Japanese Prime Minsiter Toshiki Kaifu. Quayle said he told
Kaifu Washington would like a Japanese presence in the gulf in
addition to the billions of dollars Tokyo has committed there.
   Kaifu had proposed sending Japanese soldiers to be the gulf for
non-combat duty, but the measure failed to win enough support in
Parliament. The government and the opposition have now agreed to
draft a new measure calling for the dispatch of Japanese civilians
as part of peacekeeping efforts.
   Still, more allied soldiers and hardware may be on their way to
join the U.S. expeditionary force that has gathered in the Saudi
desert as the chief challenger to Saddam.
   The Times of London reported today that Britain is expected to
send an additional 6,000 troops and more than 100 additional tanks
to the gulf, increasing its ground forces there to 15,500 and its
tanks to more than 220.
   The Bush administration has indicated that its readiness to
attack Iraqi forces to dislodge them from Kuwait, if a U.N.-ordered
embargo on trade with Iraq and saber-rattling fail.
   That position is encountering resistance from some allies abroad
and some leading members of Congress who accuse the president of
showing too much of an inclination to resort quickly to the
military option.
   Bush last week decided to send 200,000 more troops to the
Persian Gulf to bolster the 230,000 American GIs already there,
putting U.S. forces on an offensive footing.
   On Tuesday, key Democratic and Republican senators asked him to
convene an emergency session of Congress to discuss the
administration's gulf policy.
   The White House quickly called such a session unnecessary. Said
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater: ``There is no war.''
   Iraq's harsh criticism of the U.S. plan for an amphibious
assault exercise in Saudi Arabia came a day after the Pentagon
announced it. Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams would not say when
or exactly where the exercise would be held.
   The Washington Times said it would be held 10 miles from Kuwait.
   ``This behaviour constitutes a clear act of provocation that
exposes, along with other evidence, America's aggressive intentions
against Iraq,'' the official Iraqi News Agency quoted an
unidentified Iraqi government source as saying.
   Iraq also criticized the U.S. buildup in the region in a letter
to the Security Council today. Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said the
United States was looking for an excuse to ``unleash aggression
under a smoke screen by sowing confusion and organizing a campaign
to mislead the American people, the United States Congress and
world public opinion.''

   Retail sales inched up 0.1 percent in October,
fueled for the third straight month by the high cost of gasoline,
the government said today. Excluding gasoline, sales fell 0.1
percent amid continuing signs of fading consumer confidence.
   The Commerce Department said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted
$152.3 billion, up from $152.1 billion in September.
   The revised 1.3 percent gain in September was a bit stronger
than the 1.1 percent increase originally reported. But excluding
the gasoline impact, sales were up only 0.9 percent.
   Many analysts now believe the U.S. economy is in a recession
which could be intensified by a drop in personal consumption.
Retail sales represent about a half of all consumer spending, which
itself accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
   The department said retail sales since August have been
artificially inflated by gasoline prices that surged after Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and disrupted world petroleum markets -
not by increased sales volume.
   Some of the other details in the report were suggested in
advance last Thursday when the nation's biggest retailers reported
dismal sales in October.
   Analysts have said consumers have become cautious in their
spending in recent months after fears of war in the Persian Gulf
added to their anxiety over the weakening economy.
   The Conference Board, a New York business research organization,
has reported that consumer confidence in the economy plunged in
October to the lowest level since 1981-82 recession.
   Sales at department stores, a key barometer of consumer
sentiment, were off 0.6 percent after falling 1.1 percent in
September.
   Automobile sales, which have been choppy through much of the
year, slowed to a 0.7 percent gain from a 2.9 percent advance the
previous month. Analysts have attributed much of the October sales
to fleet purchases by rental car companies.
   Excluding the automobile category, sales were unchanged from the
previous month. Auto sales were off 3.7 percent in August.
   Sales of durable goods, which include cars and other items
expected to last more than three years, were up 0.7 percent
following a 1.4 percent increase in September.
   Besides automobiles, other components of the durable category
were mixed. Sales of furniture and other home furnishings fell 0.3
percent while building materials jumped 1.5 percent.
   Non-durable goods, which include food and gasoline, slipped 0.2
percent after a 1.2 percent gain a month earlier.
   Sales at gasoline stations rose 3.2 percent but analysts said in
advance of the report the increase would reflect higher prices in
the wake of the Iraqi invasion rather an an increase in volume.
   Except for a 1.6 percent increase in drug store sales, all other
categories dropped - grocery stores down 0.5 percent, clothing
stores down 1.0 percent and restaurant and bar, off 0.3 percent.

   Vice President Dan Quayle told Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu today that Washington would like a Japanese presence
in the Persian Gulf in addition to the billions of dollars Tokyo
has committed there.
   Quayle told reporters he had expressed appreciation for the $4
billion Japan has offered to the U.S.-led force arrayed against
Iraq and to the nations suffering economic losses because of the
trade embargo against Baghdad.
   ``It has been an adequate response, but (we) hope for more,''
Quayle told reporters after meeting with Kaifu. ``I reaffirmed our
interest in having a Japanese presence in the Persian Gulf.''
   The vice president said it was up to Tokyo, and not Washington,
to decide what form Japan's involvement would take.
   ``We are not going to detail what that presence should be. The
Japanese political system will make that determination,'' he said.
   ``As Japan has achieved economic superpower status, there are
certain responsibilities on a global basis that go with that.''
   Kaifu proposed legislation that would have allowed Japanese
soldiers to be deployed in the gulf for non-combat duty, but the
measure failed to win enough support in Parliament.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party and opposition groups
have agreed to draft new legislation saying that Japanese civilians
could be sent overseas as part of international peacekeeping
efforts.
   Japan now has a small medical team in the gulf.
   Japan's Foreign Ministry said Kaifu responded that any further
actions by Japan would have to be based on discussions in
Parliament about the nation's international role.
   The ministry said Quayle also had asked Japan to foot a larger
share of the cost of stationing U.S. forces in Japan.
   Japan's Constitution, which was written by U.S. officials at the
conclusion of World War II, prohibits Japan from sending troops
overseas.
   Quayle, who was in Japan for the enthronement of Emperor
Akihito, left Tokyo soon after the meeting with Kaifu.
   On the issue of trade, Quayle reportedly gave a letter to Kaifu
from President Bush in which the president reiterated the U.S.
position that Tokyo should remove its ban on imports of rice,
Japan's staple food.
   ``The Cold War must not be replaced by a trade war,'' Quayle
said.
   ``The `R' word did pass my lips,'' he said, meaning rice.
``Japan has a rice problem, the United States has a problem with
sugar and dairy,'' he added, referring to American agricultural
products that receive government protection.
   ``Japan knows what the problems are ... and we just need to move
this forward,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report Details TV's Inadequate Depiction of Women</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In front of the camera and behind it, women
in television have a long way to go before their numbers equal
those of men.
   Not only are there far fewer women than men in virtually every
aspect of TV production, but the depiction of women in prime-time
programs perpetuates a stereotype of half-clad, half-brained
creatures.
   Those findings highlight an 81-page study titled ``What's Wrong
With This Picture?'' released today by Women in Film, a Los Angeles
organization, and the Washington D.C.-based National Commission on
Working Women.
   The yearlong study examined 80 prime-time programs on the ABC,
CBS, NBC and Fox Broadcasting Co. networks. It assessed 555 TV
characters and the producers, writers and directors responsible for
creating them.
   ``Women continue to fare poorly on television - both on screen
and behind the camera - despite significant gains over time and
some notable, but scattered breakthroughs,'' the study said.
   ``Male characters outnumber females in on-screen portrayals
(especially dramas), and men producers, writers and directors
greatly outnumber women in those jobs.''
   Specifically, the study found:
   - Fewer than half of all television series characters are women,
compared to 51 percent of the general population;
   - Male drama characters outnumber women by almost two-to-one;
   - Only three percent of female TV characters are over the age of
60, compared to 14 percent in real life;
   - Men comprise 85 percent of television's producers, 91 percent
of directors and 75 percent of writers.
   Of the four networks, Fox had the highest percentage of women
producers, writers and directors, with 26 percent, 33 percent and
12 percent, respectively.
   Of prime-time shows, CBS' ``Sugar 'n' Spice'' (now canceled) had
the highest percentage of female producers with 75 percent. CBS'
``Designing Women'' had the highest percentage of women writers
with 83 percent and NBC's ``A Different World'' had the highest
percentage of women directors with 96 percent.
   Still, more than half of the 80 shows studied had no female
directors.
   The report did note that women have made inroads in television,
especially with strong female leads such as nurse Colleen McMurphy
in ABC's ``China Beach'' and journalist Murphy Brown on the CBS
series of the same name.
   But such portrayals are the exception, not the rule, of TV
programming, the report said.
   ``Despite working women's breakthroughs on TV, too many female
characters remain the extension of male fantasies,'' it stated.
   And, it noted, ``It is virtually impossible to watch an evening
of entertainment television without encountering young women in
various states of undress. Men on TV wear more clothes than women,
and they keep them on.''

   In the most serious challenge to Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine said
today he will contest her position as leader of the Conservative
Party, and thus prime minister.
   Heseltine, who resigned as Mrs. Thatcher's defense minister in
1986, will run in a ballot among Conservative legislators next
week.
   The challenge to Mrs. Thatcher after 11 years in power comes
amid growing criticism within the governing party over the prime
minister's reluctance to integrate with the European Community.
   The party also is suffering in the polls as a result of high
interest rates, double-digit inflation and an unpopular local
per-capita tax dubbed the ``poll tax.''
   ``I am persuaded that I have a better prospect now than Mrs.
Thatcher of leading the Conservative Party into a fourth election
victory,'' said Heseltine, 57, in a statement broadcast on Sky
Television.
   ``In essence, the prime minister holds views on Europe behind
which she has not been able to maintain a united Cabinet. This
damages the proper pursuit of Britain's national interest,''
Heseltine said.
   He said he decided to run because of deep divisions within the
party over steps toward European unity and the Conservatives'
recent third-place finish in a parliamentary special election. He
promised to review the new local tax, which Mrs. Thatcher pushed
through Parliament.
   There was no immediate statement from Mrs. Thatcher, but aides
told reporters at her 10 Downing St. office that she was determined
to defeat Heseltine.
   Kenneth Baker, the chairman of the Conservative Party, said
Heseltine's candidacy was ``unnecessary and unwanted.''
   ``More than 100 of my parliamentary colleagues have urged me to
stand and promised me their support,'' Heseltine said.
   To win Tuesday, Mrs. Thatcher or Heseltine needs to get 50
percent of the votes cast by Tory legislators, plus 15 percent more
than the opponent's vote.
   If all 372 Conservative legislators participate in the secret
ballot, Heseltine would need 159 votes to force a second ballot,
Mrs. Thatcher 214 votes to avoid one. The number of votes required
decreases as the number of abstentions increases.
   The same rules apply on a second ballot, but other candidates
could jump in. If that ballot fails to produce a winner, a third
ballot would be held on Nov. 29, limited to the top three finishers
in the second ballot.
   The winner is prime minister, and no general election is
required.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who will be in Paris attending a 35-nation summit
of leaders from East and West, will vote by proxy in the ballot,
party officials said.
   Heseltine stepped forward a day after Sir Geoffrey Howe, who
resigned as deputy prime minister Nov. 1, delivered a scathing
attack in the House of Commons on the leader he had served
throughout her years in power.
   ``The time has come for others to consider their own response to
the tragic conflict of loyalty with which I have myself wrestled
for perhaps too long,'' said Howe, who had been the last survivor
of Mrs. Thatcher's first Cabinet in 1979.
   Howe resigned in protest of Mrs. Thatcher's rejection of a plan
adopted by the 11 other European Community leaders at a summit in
Rome to set up a single central bank by 1994 and a single currency,
perhaps by the year 2000.
   Thatcher supporters on Tuesday came to her defense.
   ``To attempt to throw over Margaret Thatcher now would be an act
of panic and madness, and a denial of all she has achieved over the
past 11 years,'' parliamentarian Sir John Stokes said Tuesday in
defense of the Tory leader.
   ``If the Tory party is sensible and pulls itself together it can
still win the next general election without jettisoning the prime
minister,'' he said.
   Lawmaker George Younger said the deployment of British troops in
the Middle East made it the wrong time for a challenge against ``a
critical world leader.''
   Mrs. Thatcher has faced no serious challenge since she ousted
former prime minister Edward Heath as party leader in 1975.
   The woman who faced down rebellious labor unions, slashed
government spending and was known in the Soviet press as the ``Iron
Lady'' served notice she would not go without a fight.
   Howe said he resigned because of a fundamental dispute with Mrs.
Thatcher over policy on steps toward European union, an issue on
which Heseltine has also disagreed with the prime minister.
   Howe contrasted Winston Churchill's vision of a United States of
Europe with ``the nightmare image sometimes conjured up by the
prime minister, who seems to look out on a continent that is
positively teeming with ill-intentioned people.''
   Though Europe is the issue on which the Conservatives have
chosen to fight, the party is also under pressure because of
double-digit inflation and interest rates of 14 percent.
   The opposition Labor Party, no longer the divided doctrinaire
socialist party that Mrs. Thatcher easily defeated in 1979, has
been ahead in opinion polls for 16 months.

   The city's former mayor, now a convicted
felon, has been declared official winner of last week's mayoral
race but faces a challenge from a group that says his conviction
makes him ineligible for office.
   The Providence Board of Canvassers refused Tuesday to decide
whether Vincent A. ``Buddy'' Cianci Jr. is barred from returning to
office because of his 1984 conviction.
   Board members said their panel did not have authority to
consider that issue, so Cianci's opponents took their case to the
state Board of Elections.
   ``I'm not bothered by it,'' Cianci said. ``I don't think it's
going to stop me from taking the oath of office.''
   A challenge filed Friday by three Providence voters, and joined
Tuesday by 15 others, argued Cianci should be barred from office
under a 1986 amendment to the state Constitution. That amendment
prohibits anyone convicted of a felony from holding office for
three years after completing a sentence or probation.
   The Board of Elections scheduled a Monday hearing on the appeal.
   Cianci pleaded no contest on April 24, 1984, to assaulting a man
he thought was having an affair with his estranged wife. In Rhode
Island, a no contest plea is recorded as a conviction. He received
a five-year suspended sentence, and the felony forced him from the
office he had held for 10 years.
   Cianci's lawyer, Ronald DelSesto, said the 1986 law was not
retroactive to Cianci's 1984 conviction.
   Cianci, a Republican, was certified the victor with 16,416 votes
to independent Frederick Lippitt's 16,099 and Democrat Andrew
Annaldo's 14,398.
   Incumbent Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr., a Democrat, ran
unsuccessfully for governor.

   Police said today they are
searching for four African National Congress members in connection
with an alleged plot to overthrow the government.
   The four are suspected of illegally importing arms, ammunition
and explosives for so-called Operation Vula, police said.
   Eight other suspects were arrested in July and were recently
charged in connection with the alleged plot against the government.
They have been released on bail.
   The ANC says the government should not prosecute its members for
Operation Vula, which it claims was part of regular ANC military
activities before the armed struggle was suspended Aug. 6.
   Authorities say the African National Congress and its ally, the
Communist Party, planned to topple the government by force if peace
talks on ending apartheid failed. The government and the ANC, the
leading black opposition movement, have been holding talks since
May.
   Ronnie Kasrils, one of the four suspects sought and a
high-ranking ANC and Communist Party member, went into hiding
earlier this year when the government failed to extend a temporary
amnesty for him. Police said the other three people sought are
Janet Love, Charles Ndaba and Christopher Manye.
   Meanwhile, the Bophuthatswana black homeland said it detained 44
ANC members this week after authorities uncovered an alleged ANC
plot to overthrow homeland leader Lucas Mangope.
   Clement Sehume, the Bophuthatswana education minister, said the
crackdown was aimed at ``certain elements'' and not the ANC as a
whole.
   The ANC, which considers the homelands part of the apartheid
system of racial segregation and white dominance, denied plotting
to kill Mangope or overthrow the government.
   The ANC and other anti-apartheid groups call for the homelands
to be reincorporated into South Africa. Mangope has rejected such a
move.

   A 6-year-old boy shot and seriously wounded

   The boy, who was at home with his mother in their apartment
Tuesday, took the rifle from the closet in his parents' bedroom and
shot his mother in the abdomen, police said.
   The boy, whom police refused to name, told officers he loaded
the gun himself. After pulling the trigger, he ran downstairs to
seek help from neighbors, they said.
   The mother was taken to a hospital in Lille, a northern French
city near the Belgian border, while the boy was put in temporary
custody of a children's home.

   Police broke into a wing of Alikarnasus
prison early Wednesday and crushed a revolt by 11 inmates that had
lasted more than a month.
   Police reported that four prisoners and four prison officials
were slightly injured when the inmates resisted.
   The uprising began Oct. 8 in protest over crowded living
conditions in the small prison, located near this city on the
island of Crete. The prison houses 130 convicts.
   The inmates initially took eight hostages but later released
them and continued to occupy a prison wing. On Tuesday, they
ignored a police ultimatum to return to their cells.
   The start of the rebellion at Alikarnasus sparked uprisings in
other prisons throughout the country, including Korydallos, the
maximum-security institution near Athens, a week later. That
rebellion ended Monday.

<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein has contributed a new word
to the English language: ``guestages,'' short for
``guest-hostages.''
   The Iraqi president's ministers routinely warn reporters not to
refer to the thousands of Westerners banned from leaving Iraq as
hostages.
   ``This is a very, very bad and dirty word and I'm not going to
accept it,'' says Information and Culture Minister Latif Jassim
during his news briefings.
   And a warning in Iraq today should be taken seriously.
   After several such warnings, the word ``guestages'' entered the
lexicon of Iraqispeak.
   ``Are you a hos...'' The moment you ask any of the hundreds of
Westerners held in Baghdad hotels, comes the swift reply: ``No, I'm
a guestage.''
   To tell the world that Western news reports on the conditions of
hostages held at strategic sites are wrong, Iraq's state-run
television has started a new program, ``Guest News,'' in which
Americans, British, Japanese and Germans are shown playing pool or
giving interviews.
   Understandably the hostages speak highly of Iraq. But some use
sign language to convey their true feelings.
   ---
   Iraqis are obsessed with spying on each other. The practice is
ctively encouraged by the authorities, who even urge
schoolchildren to tell what their parents say at home.
   As Iraqis tell it, two officials spotted each other dining with
western reporters in one of the fish restaurants along the banks of
the Tigris River that flows through Baghdad.
   Both dutifully reported the fact to the Al-Amn, the secret
police. Both were promptly transferred to remote towns.
   It is an accepted fact that foreigners' telephones are tapped.
Lines are disconnected if people talk in a language the
eavesdroppers don't understood.
   When a reporter called his home in India and started speaking in
Bengali with his wife, the line went dead. There are no Bengali
interpreters in Baghdad.
   On Fridays, the Moslem Sabbath, international calls are
restricted to 10 minutes because there are not enough people to tap
all the calls.
   In all of Baghdad, only one public telex functions. It's at the
al-Rasheed Hotel, where all foreign journalists must stay. The
telex is constantly monitored.
   People living in Baghdad, almost by habit, switch on the radio
or play a tape when talking about politics or war so that their
conversations can't be picked up by surveillance bugs. People in
offices or at parties whisper when they talk.
   Iraqis are discouraged from talking to foreigners. Those who are
found in the company of one are promptly hauled off for
interrogation, or worse.
   ---
   ``The Iraqi president is probably the most protected world
leader today,'' an Asian diplomat said.
   Taxi drivers warn their fares in advance not to point their
finger in the direction of the presidential palace.
   Police patrols in Mercedes-Benz sedans scour the area around the
palace, ready to arrest anyone who stops outside the perimeter
walls.
   No pedestrians are allowed within a 500-yard radius of the
heavily guarded complex, where multi-barreled anti-aircraft guns
are manned round the clock.
   Saddam, who has survived several assassination attempts and coup
plots since he took power in 1979, rarely appears in public in
Baghdad these days.
   Foreign television networks allowed to interview him are told to
be ready three days in advance. The actual interview is done
suddenly at 30 minutes' notice.
   Cars are sent from the palace to pick up the TV crew. Not that
foreigners on the crews get to do much. The networks can only use
Iraqi cameramen and cameras for the interviews.

   Landmark Imports, Inc., of Memphis, Tenn., has
recalled 24 planter-style floor lamps that the government says may
pose an electrocution hazard, even when switched off.
   The voluntary recall, in cooperation with the Consumer Product
Safety Commission, involves the model 4088 3-U planter floor lamp
sold in the Memphis area last year.
   Most of the 24 units were obtained from Landmark by three
stores: B&amp;T Enterprises in South Medon, Tenn., and MTC Company and
Import 1, both in Memphis. The model 4088 3-U features a single
light socket at the top of a center post, and three planter
supports at the ends of its U-shaped support legs.
   The danger, the CPSC said, stems from the possible use of
excessively long screws used to attach the three metal support legs
to the center post. The screws may pierce the power cord's
insulation, meaning consumers could be electrocuted if they touched
any part of the brass frame, the agency said.
   Purchasers of the model 4088 3-U should unplug it immediately
and return it to the store for a refund of the purchase price. The
lamp sold for about $40.
   Consumers with questions may call Landmark Imports at
901-346-0708.

   Scientists have discovered the first specifc abnormality in the
brains of people with hyperactivity, the most common psychiatric
disorder of childhood, and believe it may an underlying cause of
the condition.
   Their study found that parts of the brain essential for
attention and controlling behavior do not work as hard as usual in
hyperactive people. Experts described this as a potentially
important insight into the sources of the mysterious ailment.
   People have long suspected that some physical irregularity is at
the heart of the disorder, which affects between 2 percent and 4
percent of school-age children.
   However, Dr. Alan J. Zametkin, who directed the research, said,
``This is the first large study of hyperactivity that shows some
sort of metabolic abnormality.''
   The research, conducted at the National Institute of Mental
Health in Bethesda, Md., was published in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine.
   Brain scans of adults who had been afflicted with the disorder
since childhood showed that their brain cells were 8 percent less
active than those of normal people. However, the reduction was
especially dramatic in the parts of the brain that control
attention and inhibit behavior.
   Hyperactivity, known technically as attention
deficit-hyperactivity disorder, is a serious ailment that makes
children inattentive and impulsive. They tend to blurt out answers
in school, run into the street without looking and constantly
fidget, squirm and jump about. Their hot tempers and frequent
disobedience make them difficult for parents and teachers to
handle.
   About half the time, the disorder persists into adulthood, and
victims are more likely to have run-ins with the law and abuse
drugs and alcohol.
   About three-quarters of victims improve when given mild
stimulant drugs, such as Ritalin. Just why these medicines work is
unclear. However, they help people concentrate with less
distraction and irritability.
   Zametkin said he hoped the latest findings will reduce the
stigma attached to being treated for this disorder by showing that
it involves a biological abnormality.
   Hyperactivity often runs in families. The latest study was
conducted on 25 adults who had been hyperactive since childhood.
They were also parents of hyperactive youngsters.
   The researchers compared the metabolism - the rate at which
energy is used - in the brains of the hyperactive adults and 50
normal people. They found that brain activity was significantly
reduced among hyperactives in 30 of 60 specific regions of the
brain.
   In particular, they noticed reductions in the premotor cortex
and the superior prefrontal cortex. These parts of the brain
control attention. Damage to them can result in inattention and
difficulty in controlling behavior.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Gabrielle Weiss of Montreal
Children's Hospital said the findings ``represent a clear advance
in our understanding'' of hyperactivity.
   But whether low metabolism is the ultimate cause of
hyperactivity is still unclear.
   ``I'm not going to say it's the cause,'' said Zametkin. ``We
have to look at young kids and people with the non-genetic form of
the disorder. But it's possible this has something to do with the
cause.''
   Dr. Paul H. Wender of the University of Utah said that finding
any biological abnormality in a mental illness ``is of great
interest.'' But he said it may not turn out to be the basic cause
of hyperactivity. Instead, the cortex may be sluggish because of
faulty control signals from a more primitive part of the brain.
   ``If the more primitive centers don't tell the guys upstairs to
wake up, they won't have attention,'' he said. ``But the problem is
not in the cortex. It's the guys downstais.''
   Zametkin said that measuring brain metabolism may someday
provide a way of accurately diagnosing hyperactivity. It could also
allow doctors to check the effects of different drug treatments.
Currently, he is studying how Ritalin changes the brain's metabolic
activity.
   Zametkin conducted the newly published study by injecting sugar
that contained a radioactive label. Then he performed
positron-emission tomography, or PET scans. These produce
cross-sectional pictures of the head that show how intensely the
radioactive sugar is being used.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court of Ireland today
ordered the extradition to Britain of an alleged IRA bomber who is
in his 36th day of a hunger strike to fight extradition.
   The accused man, Dessie Ellis, was flown by military aircraft to
London after losing the appeal. He will stand trial in Britain on
conspiracy and explosives possession charges arising from a 1981
London bombing campaign in which three people died, police said.
   It was the first time the Irish court has ordered the
extradition to Britain of someone wanted on terrorist charges under
new Irish laws intended to simplify the extradition procedure.
   The 38-year-old television engineer was hospitalized last week
and was said to be ``very weak.'' He remained in the military
hospital this morning and was not in court to hear the unanimous
decision by the five judges.
   Angry Irish Republican Army supporters demonstrated outside the
court building in central Dublin, and others gathered at the
Baldonnel military air base outside Dublin, where Ellis left
Ireland.
   Hundreds of Irish troops sealed off the base.
   Ellis had said he would rather die than be extradited to
Britain. He said he will not get a fair hearing in Britain and
asked to be tried in Ireland.
   Ellis already has served a six-year jail term in the Irish
Republic for possessing explosives.
   Extradition has been a contentious issue between Britain and
Ireland. Under the previous law, some suspects wanted in Britain
have successfully pleaded that their alleged offenses were
``political.''
   In Northern Ireland, 10 prisoners belonging to the IRA or the
Irish National Liberation Army died on hunger strikes in Maze
Prison in 1981. The best known was Bobby Sands, who was elected to
the British Parliament during his 65-day hunger strike.
   No one has died while on a hunger strike in the Irish republic
since 1946.
   The IRA is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland. It wants
to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the 95 percent
Catholic Republic of Ireland, under socialist rule.

<HEAD>Clean Air Bill Signing Nears; Criticism Remains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-two months into his presidency, George
Bush has yet to make peace with environmentalists, even though he
is about to sign legislation to clean up the nation's air.
   Bush, say the environmentalists, is more talk than substance.
   ``If I had to grade him, I'd have to give him a low `D'. A year
ago, I'd have given him an `F', so he's moving up a little bit,''
said Mike Clark, president of Friends of the Earth. Bush ``has yet
to prove he's an environmentalist,'' Clark added.
   Early in his term, Bush proclaimed himself pro-environment. On
Thursday, he will sign the Clean Air Act of 1990 in a ceremony he
is expected to try to use to reenforce that image.
   The legislation, totaling more than 1,000 pages, is designed to
stem acid rain, urban smog and toxic industrial pollution by
imposing tighter controls on automobiles, factories, coal-burning
power plants and thousands of businesses.
   While leaders of environmentalist groups credit Bush for being a
major player in ushering in the first air pollution controls in 13
years, they say there are many other issues, from global warming to
protecting wetlands, on which the president has not met their test.
   Last summer, Bush expressed his irritation with
environmentalists and declared that their ``grading system is
absolutely ... absurd.''
   ``I didn't rely heavily on them for support in getting elected
... and I'm not going to be persuaded that I can get some brownie
points by appealing to (them),'' he snapped when asked by reporters
at an international economics conference in Houston about
environmentalists protesting his views on global warming.
   Among those targeted by Bush's remarks were such mainstream
environmental groups as the Wilderness Society, the National
Wildlife Federation and the Sierra Club, all of which have
criticized the president.
   His remarks ``really blew the cover,'' Mike McCloskey, president
of the Sierra Club. Until then, McCloskey said, environmentalists
had thought that their problems with the White House were largely
the work of aides such as presidential Chief of Staff John Sununu.
   ``The (president's) hostility really showed that's where he's at
too,'' McCloskey said in a recent interview.
   Bush's signing of the clean air act is not expected to soften
the criticism.
   ``This is his one and only significant environmental achievement
and he certainly is not entitled to take sole credit for it,'' said
George Frampton, president of the Wilderness Society.
   Among the few Bush actions widely praised by environmentalists
is his appointment of William Reilly, a longtime conservationist,
to head the Environmental Protection Agency.
   Reilly, highly respected in the environmental community,
staunchly defends the president's environmental record and said in
an interview that the president's critics often judge Bush against
an unfair ``standard of perfection.''
   Among the issues cited by administration officials are the
president's ban on ivory imports to protect the African elephant
and his decision last summer to postpone the leasing of
oil-drilling sites off Florida and California until environmental
concerns can be further examined.
   ``The president has many agendas and has to balance to achieve
the best benefits to the country as a whole,'' Reilly said. ``By
any objective measures, George Bush ... has done more for the
environment than any president in my memory.''
   Peter Dykstra, a spokesman for Greenpeace, counters that the
president has shrewdly espoused concern for the environment ``and
delivered less of the goods than any president.''
   Bush has taken his hardest hits on environmental issues of
broad, international concern such as global warming.
   When the latest conference on global warming concluded last week
in Geneva, Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., said the Bush administration's
performance was ``embarrassing (because) ... no one should have to
drag us kicking and screaming'' to address the problem.
   While many industrial nations have established goals on cutting
the pollutants that cause global warming, Bush steadfastly has
refused to do so and maintains that scientists have yet to
determine how serious a threat global warming will be.
   There is a long list of other issues on which Bush has
disappointed environmentalists, said Sharon Newsome, a vice
president for the National Wildlife Federation.
   She cited Bush's strong support for opening the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil exploration, a lack of progress in
developing a formal policy to protect wetlands nearly two years
after promising to do so and hints of wanting to reexamine the
Endangered Species Act to more heavily take into account economic
considerations - an issue spotlighted by the debate over the
spotted owl in the Northwest.
   On Capitol Hill, the administration has almost consistently been
on opposite sides from environmentalists, even in the debate over
how strong clean air legislation should be, said the Sierra Club's
McCloskey.
   He cited administration opposition to legislation that would
have required higher fuel economy standards for automobiles; bills
that would have reduced mining, logging and grazing on federal
lands, and a bill to protect a vast California desert.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Growth At Near Standstill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail sales growth slowed to a barely
perceptible 0.1 percent in October, the government said Wednesday,
prompting analysts to predict the holiday gift-buying season will
be a bust.
   ``I think holiday sales are going to be pretty lousy,'' said
economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New
York. ``Compared to Christmases past, it's just not going to look
very good.''
   Economist Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group in Washington
agreed, pointing to two months of declining sales at department and
clothing stores - often gauges of consumer sentiment.
   ``Consumers have a limited budget,'' she said. ``With the rapid
deterioration of the job market and more inflation, consumers just
simply have less money to spend.''
   The Commerce Department said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted
$152.3 billion, up from $152.1 billion in September. But like the
previous two months, sales were artificially inflated by high
gasoline prices, not volume.
   In fact, the department said sales actually fell 0.1 percent in
October when gasoline purchases were excluded. The price of
gasoline has spiraled since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
disrupted world oil markets.
   Analysts saw the report as further evidence of weakness in an
economy that many believe is now in a recession. Retail sales
represent about half of all consumer spending which itself accounts
for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
   Ms. Shaber predicted a repeat of last year's holiday shopping
season, when many retailers cut prices and offered other promotions
to lure consumers to their salesrooms.
   ``It's really a very, very promotional Christmas already,'' she
said. ``We have too many stores and too many malls now being
aggravated by the erosion of household purchasing power.''
   Retailers depend on the holiday shopping season for about half
of their sales and profits.
   Automobiles, which represent about 20 percent of retail sales,
slowed to a 0.7 percent gain from a 2.9 percent increase in
September. But Steinberg said unit sales were down in October,
suggesting the increase represented higher prices for
new-model-year cars.
   Excluding the auto category, overall retail sales were unchanged
from the previous month.
   Sales of durable goods, which include cars and other items
expected to last more than three years, rose 0.7 percent, just half
of their 1.4 percent gain a month earlier.
   Purchases of building materials rebounded 1.5 percent from a 1.5
percent drop in September, but sales of furniture and other home
furnishings fell 0.3 percent.
   Non-durable sales, such as food and gasoline, slipped 0.2
percent after rising 1.2 percent the previous month.
   Gasoline service station sales were up 3.2 percent after
increases of 5.6 percent in September and 7 percent immediately
after the August invasion.
   But department store sales were down 0.6 percent after a 1.1
percent loss the previous month, while apparel purchases declined
1.0 percent following September's 1.7 percent drop.
   Sales at restaurants and bars were off 0.3 percent from a 0.4
percent increase a month earlier.
   But purchases at drug stores rose 1.6 percent after a 0.9
percent gain in September.
   ``People are taking more aspirin because they're more worried,''
Steinberg suggested.

   A time capsule prepared Wednesday by
youngsters involved in a national reading program will give
students in 2089 the impression that 20th century kids were a very
literate bunch.
   Fifty selected book reviews of fourth-, fifth- and sixth-grade
students from each state were placed in the time capsule that was
``buried'' at the Library of Congress to mark the second annual
National Young Reader's Day.
   ``Six Months to Live'' tells ``how to cope with personal
problems - the ones you can't change,'' 12-year-old Tiffany Harmon
of Lexington, S.C. wrote.
   ``Kids growing up in the 1990s are faced with their own personal
battles,'' Tiffany continued. ``Some of these include drugs,
divorce, peer pressure, and stress.''
   Thomas Daniel Tarantino of Camarillo, Calif., said of ``The
Hobbit,'' ``You know, I've studied a lot about the Revolutionary
War in school, but I never had such an in-depth look at the horror
and sadness of war this book showed to me.''
   ``I love to read,'' said 11-year-old Jennie Pacheco of Bristol,
R.I. ``My mother told me when I was young that if I had a good
book, I had a good friend.''
   Jennie's favorite book is ``The Bridge to Terabithia,'' although
she noted ``I read at least two books a week. I've read 100 books
in the last two summers.''
   The reviews were in the forms of letters in which youngsters
displayed a sense of humor, as well as vivid imaginations.
   Jeremy Eggleston, 12, of Binghamton, N.Y., opened his letter,
``Hi earthling! Maybe I'd better not say `earthling' because in
your time you might be living on Jupiter. Anyway, I live in the
year 1990. When you receive this letter, you'll probably think my
generation lived in `ancient' times.''
   Ariane Kiel, 12, of St. Louis, Mo., said ``I am wondering how
you enjoy books in the year, 2089. Is your home computer able to
type out books directly from the local library? Can your watch tell
stories? Do you take a book pill while you rest and then dream
about the story?''
   ``However you enjoy books, try to pick up `Number the Stars' by
Lois Lowry,'' she said.
   The National Young Reader's Day was initiated jointly by Book
It! National Reading Incentive Program, sponsored by Pizza Hut, and
the Center for the Book in the Library of Congress to remind
Americans of the joys and importance of books for the nation's
youth.
   An estimated 27 million adult Americans are considered
functionally illiterate - unable to read, write or compute well
enough to function effectively in the workplace and in society.

   British Defense Secretary Tom
King warned Saddam Hussein on Wednesday that ``time is running
out'' for the Iraqis to leave Kuwait or military force will be
used.
   ``We are moving now into very critical weeks,'' King said at a
news conference held beneath camouflage netting in the Saudi
desert.
   ``We aren't going to keep our troops hanging around forever
doing nothing,'' King said.``It would be a very foolish man indeed
who thought we were bluffing.''
   He refused to set an exact timetable, but he added: ``He better
make a pretty early decision or he will have to take responsibility
for the consequences that will follow.''
   King spent the day on tank maneuvers with the 7th Armored
Brigade, also known as the Desert Rats. He visited British air and
naval stations in the Persian Gulf region to determine what more is
needed.
   King declined to give precise details but said he wanted to see
``where else we can help and fit in the most effective way.'' He
said reinforcements would arrive soon.
   The British have deployed 15,000 ground troops, more than 120
Challenger battle tanks, 50 combat aircraft and 12 warships.
   British ground and air forces are under the tactical control of
the U.S. military. The Desert Rats are under the tactical command
of the U.S. Marine Corps, which has been conducting joint training
exercises with the British.
   In Saudi Arabia, all troops are under the control of Prince
Khalid, but command and control of international forces under a
single commander is still being worked out if fighting spreads
outside the kingdom.
   As part of his mission, King met with Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf,
commander of all U.S. forces involved in Operation Desert Shield.
   ``We will have absolutely clear command and control
arrangements. I'm satisifed they are being achieved,'' King said.
   King rode in a tank with brigade commander Brig. Gen. Patrick
Cordingly and Lt. Gen. Sir Peter de la Billiere, commander of all
British forces in the Middle East.
   Meanwhile, King said the United Nations embargo designed to
starve Iraq out of Kuwait is costing Saddam $1 billion a month in
oil exports and $1 billion a month in import business.
   ``Stocks are starting to run out. They're starting to realize
what total isolation from the world is going to mean,'' King said.
   But he added that the military option would be applied if Saddam
refuses to abandon Kuwait.
   ``There must be no doubting our resolution. We don't want to see
conflict, but the warning is quite clear. There are limits to our
patience,'' King said.
   ``We can't allow the atrocities, the cruelty, the unbelievable
behavior to go on month after month as though we didn't care,''
King said.

<TEXT>
   Minute injections of a highly poisonous
toxin have been found effective and safe in treating a varity of
involuntary muscle spasms, a committee of experts announced today
at the National Institutes of Health.
   The toxin, obtained from a bacteria that causes botulism food
poisoning, has been used successfully to treat spasms of the
eyelids, throat, face and the vocal cords, the panel said.
   ``This is the most powerful toxin known,'' said Dr. Roger
Duvoisin of the Robert Wood Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J.
   The complex protein, known formally as botulinum toxin, is
produced by a bacteria in spoiled food and can lead to lethal food
poisoning in large doses.
   Duvoisin said, however, that in very small injected doses the
toxin has the ability to block signals from nerves to muscles. This
action will halt involuntary muscle spasms.
   ``It has given relief where little was available before'' for
muscle spasms, Duvoisin said.
   The injections have been used for patients whose lives were
blighted by such ailments as the involuntary and uncontrollable
closing of the eyelids, the inability to speak because of vocal
cord spasms and facial tics that cause the muscles to contort
repeatedly.
   The committee organized by NIH consisted of experts from around
the country who evaluate clinical results from experimental use of
the toxin in a variety of patients.
   ``We have seen at this conference impressive evidence that this
is the first choice of treatment for several disabling disorders,''
Duvoisin said.
   ``Because of the high success rates of the toxin treatment,
thousands of more patients have the potential to lead improved
lives,'' he said.
   The committee called for additional studies to determine how
else the toxin might be used and to better understand its precise
action in the body.
   Injections of the toxin, which can cost from $400 to $1,800,
must usually be repeated three to four times a year for continuous
symptomatic relief.
   Duvoisin emphasized that the injections only control the
symptoms of the muscle spasms and are not a permanent cure.

   Two decades ago Nguyen Ngoc Hung was creeping
through the jungles of Southeast Asia, a North Vietnamese hunting
American soldiers. Now he's telling his former enemies of the
troubles they share: brothers missing in action and emotional
problems.
   Hung has embarked on what he calls a ``healing mission'' to meet
his former enemies.
   Other Vietnamese who fought the Americans have visited the
United States, but none has come solely to talk to U.S. combat
veterans.
   On Monday - Veterans Day - Hung stood in front of the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial in Manhattan and pledged to organize Vietnamese
combat veterans to search for the remains of U.S. serviceman.
   ``I doubt the diplomats can go into the jungle and forest and
find the men buried in battle,'' he said.
   Moments after making the promise he prayed with American vets.
One gave him a flower.
   At a meeting later in Harlem, Hung told his audience that
Americans aren't the only ones with soldiers missing in action -
his younger brother is one of 300,000 Vietnamese soldiers still
unaccounted for.
   When he asked U.S. servicemen to help find North Vietnamese
remains, a veteran in the audience replied: ``I can give you some
of the grave sites.''
   Hung, 42, joined the North Vietnamese army at 20 and fought from
1969 to 1975, mostly on foot and sometimes with the Viet Cong in
South Vietnam.
   After the war, he finished college, studied English in England
and Australia, and returned to Hanoi to teach at the Foreign
Languages College. He and wife have two sons who are crazy about
American music.
   After an interview with him in Vietnam was broadcast last year
on ``60 Minutes,'' Hung was invited to visit by the National
Network of Indochina Activists and the Asia Resource Center.
   Since arriving Nov. 1, he has met veterans in New York,
Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., and visits are planned during
the next month for New Haven, Conn.; Boston; Atlanta; Madison,
Wis.; Pittsburgh; Los Angeles; San Francisco, and San Diego.
   A week ago, he met with a group of veterans with post-traumatic
stress syndrome.
   ``They looked at me attentively as I came in,'' he said.
   But then they began to talk: about a mother's suspicious looks,
about a girlfriend's rejection, about drugs and nightmares and
flashbacks.
   Although some veterans have criticized the U.S. government's
psychological programs for them, Hung was impressed.
   ``In Vietnam the government thought we were the winner, so their
soldiers didn't have any problems,'' he said. In fact, ``the
Vietnamese had flashbacks and nightmares and things like that,
too.''
   ``Psychology is new in Vietnam. We need something like that
here,'' he said. ``One of my friends went crazy after the war, and
they just sent him home. He's with his family, but ... he can't do
anything.''
   Still, he said, ``In our country we don't have a homeless
veteran.''
   At the Harlem meeting, one man asked about a rumor he'd heard -
that Vietnamese sometimes allowed black soldiers to pass before
opening fire on whites.
   Hung thought for a moment and answered: ``Yes.''
   He later explained that the Viet Cong included villagers who by
day mingled with many U.S. soldiers. When they became soldiers
themselves at night, they would allow friendly faces to pass before
firing at officers, many of whom were unpopular with local
residents and most of whom happened to be white.
   ``Not all American soldiers were bad. Some gave food to the
people,'' he said. ``We weren't shooting at the black or the white,
we were shooting at the bad man.
   ``There was something nice and funny going on during the war
that nobody wanted to dip into. It was kind of like if you behave,
you were well, if you didn't behave, you were punished.''
   New York state veteran counselor Daniel A. Friedman said he
thinks Nguyen's visit is a good thing.
   ``I think it's healthy to bury the hatchet, to heal the
wounds,'' said Friedman, who was at the Vietnam Memorial service.
   ``I think it's important for people to put the war behind
them,'' Friedman said. ``My fellow Vietnam veterans who want to
keep refighting the war are not helping themselves.''

   Typhoon Mike roared out to sea
Wednesday after killing at least 112 people and devastating the
country's second most important industrial center.
   The typhoon, which hit the central Philippines Tuesday with peak
winds of 150 mph, had weakened to 94 mph and was continuing west
into the South China Sea late Wednesday, said Crisologo Enriquez,
the Manila weather bureau's chief forecaster.
   About 140 people were missing and 320,000 refugees from te
typhoon jammed schools, offices and makeshift evacuation centers.
   President Corazon Aquino, who returned Wednesday from Japan,
declared 30 of the country's 73 provinces disaster areas.
   Among the most severely devastated areas was Cebu city, the most
important industrial and transport center next to Manila, and
Negros Occidental province, where millions of dollars worth of
sugar crops could be lost.
   The typhoon sunk at least 41 cargo and passenger vessels, nearly
all of them in the Cebu harbor. Navy officials said most sank in a
narrow channel, among the busiest maritime centers in the country,
and could pose danger to other vessels.
   The navy also reported that at least eight ships ran aground,
including the research vessel Calypso, operated by Jacques
Cousteau. The navy said the Calypso ran aground off Mindoro Island
but there was no word on the crew.
   The French Embassy said Cousteau himself was not in the
Philippines. The embassy said it was unaware of the report.
   Radio station DYHP reported from Cebu that 28 people were
confirmed dead in the city and surrounding districts.
   Cebu Mayor Tomas Osmena, contacted by radio from Manila, said
the city was without electricity, telephones and drinking water. He
said he had not been able to make contact with officials in Manila.
   ``The general situation in the city is that it's almost
impossible to quantify the damage,'' Osmena said in an interview.
``There is tremendous and widespread damage, particularly among the
poor.''
   Osmena said numerous telephone and electric poles had been blown
down and strewn on the streets ``like matchsticks,'' blocking
traffic.
   During the height of the storm Tuesday, a ship slammed into a
bridge that links the city to Mactan island, causing major
structural damage, he said. An international airport, which also
suffered damage, and an fuel depot, are on the island.
   ``We are in need of basic infrastructure,'' Osmena said. ``We
are highly susceptible to an epidemic because there is no water.''
   Other residents reached by radio from Manila, 350 miles to the
north, said hundreds of buildings were damaged.
   Cebu radio stations said about 90 percent of all houses built of
wood were damaged or destroyed.
   The DYHP report said many banks and schools have closed and
shops reopened late on Wednesday. Local rice prices also have gone
up.
   In Negros Occidental province, Arsenio Yulo, Sugar Regulatory
Administration chief, reported extensive damage to 1.9 million tons
of sugar crops valued at about $696.4 million. The province
produces most of the country's sugar for export and domestic use.
   Thousands of acres of rice and corn, among the staple crops in
the central region, also had been damaged.
   The Philippine coast guard said 25 crew members were missing
after the ship Dona Roberta sank near Cagayan de Oro, about 500
miles south of Manila. Two other cargo vessels were reported
missing near the area. Three sailors also were missing after their
navy craft sank in Cebu harbor.
   Seventeen workers, including six Americans, trapped on an oil
rig off Palawan Island, were reported safe Wednesday. An additional
68 workers had been evacuated from the rig, operated by Alcorn
Production-Philippines.
   The typhoon was the 14th and the strongest to hit the country
this year.

<HEAD>The Survey Says: Marriage Pays Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Single men looking for a raise or
promotion should consider a serious option: Get married.
   Married men earn an average of 30.6 percent more than unmarried
men, according to a University of Michigan survey released Tuesday.
   Husbands outearn bachelors in several other countries as well,
said Robert Schoeni, a doctoral student at the school's Population
Studies Center.
   ``The average earnings of married men were consistently higher
than the earnings of their unmarried counterparts in all the
countries we studied. The effect persisted even when education, age
or experience, and race were taken into account,'' Schoeni said.
   He offered three possible explanations:
   -Employers are more likely to hire and promote married men
because they consider them more stable and community oriented.
   -Women are more likely to marry financially successful men.
   -Married men feel responsible for a wife and family and become
more productive.
   ``Our data doesn't clarify which is the correct explanation. I
suspect, however, that all three explanations play a role,''
Schoeni said.
   Schoeni studied incomes in 12 countries, using data for 25- to
64-year-old males collected since 1983 by the Center for
Population, Poverty and Policy Studies in Walferdange, Luxembourg.
He said he found marriage had a particularly powerful effect on
men's earnings in the United States, Norway, Sweden and
Switzerland.
   In the United States, the effect was powerful at all ages: 28.8
percent at age 30; 30.3 percent at age 40 and 32.5 percent at age
50.
   In Italy and in pre-democracy Poland, the effect was weaker -
9.3 percent in Italy and only 3.1 percent in Poland. Schoeni said
he didn't know why the gap was narrower in Italy. He said a planned
economy like pre-democracy Poland's was not affected much by issues
such as marriage.
   The gap in different countries:
   -Australia: 13.6 percent.
   -Canada: 14.4 percent.
   -France: 12.7 percent.
   -Germany: 12.4 percent.
   -Italy: 9.3 percent.
   -Netherlands: 11.9 percent.
   -Norway: 26.4 percent.
   -Poland: 3.1 percent.
   -Sweden: 26.1 percent.
   -Switzerland: 25.9 percent.
   -United Kingdom: 12.7 percent.
   -United States: 30.6 percent.

   A former teacher was sentenced today to 20
years in prison for molesting four school boys. He allegedly
molested dozens of other students over 30 years.
   Douglas Marks, 63, was also fined $25,000 to pay for counseling
of his victims and other youths involved in sex crimes.
   Marks pleaded guilty July 9 to four counts of felony sexual
assault for molesting the four boys between 1985 and 1989. The
fathers of two of those boys said they, too, had been victims of
Marks.
   Court records cited 22 accusations of molestation dating to
1956, most too old to prosecute. County Attorney Rich Llewellyn
said he had found 45 victims, and that Marks' deviant behavior
extended back 50 years, first as a victim.
   District Judge Frank Davis of Dillon sentenced Marks to a
40-year term but suspended 20 years of the prison term. Davis also
said if Marks is paroled, he can have no contact with anyone
younger than 18 years old.
   Marks could be eligible for parole in about five years,
Llewellyn said.
   During a presentence hearing last week, Davis refused to allow
some of Marks' victims to testify.
   ``I decided I wasn't going to embarrass this poor man any
more,'' he said.
   This morning, Davis told Marks: ``Last week I spared you a
minitrial. I can't spare you any longer.''
   Llewellyn said he was satisfied with the sentence, adding that
Marks had shown little remorse.
   Marks' lawyer had asked that his client be sentenced to a
treatment program and 238 days in jail, most served on weekends in
the county jail at Boulder.
   Marks is a member of a prominent local family that owns
substantial ranch property in the Helena-Boulder area and a sawmill
in Clancy. A brother, Bob Marks, has been a state representative
for 20 years and speaker of the Montana House in 1981 and 1987.
   Over more than three decades of teaching in this ranching region
between Helena and Butte, Marks built a reputation as a selfless
and devoted teacher.
   Marks was removed from a teaching job in Boulder in 1959 after
three students accused him of molesting them. He found another
teaching job the next year in Clancy, about 20 miles away, then was
rehired at Boulder Elementary School in 1965.
   In 1984, a young man came forward against Marks. It was more
than five years before Marks was finally charged and all four of
the offenses to which Marks pleaded guilty occurred after the 1984
complaint.

   Democratic leaders told President Bush today
they believe the Constitution requires Bush to seek congressional
authorization before using military force in the Persian Gulf. The
White House left its options open.
   `The president did not indicate a commitment to do that or a
refusal to do that,'' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, at a news conference a
few moments later, said Bush ``certainly will follow the
Constitution.''
   However, Baker said, ``it's a question - what the Constitution
requires.''
   Baker, who is a lawyer, said that the administration respects
Congress' prerogative under the Constitution to declare war.
   But Baker said he would not ``play the game'' of getting into
what the president might do since the use of force at this point
was ``still hypothetical.''
   Mitchell said he and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, at a
two-hour meeting at the White House, ``expressed directly to the
president our view that if he does make a decision to use military
force, that under the circumstances, the requirements of the
Constitution would have to be met.''
   He said that ``would involve presentment of that decision to the
Congress for authorization.''
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel said Bush told the lawmakers
that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein threatens to have a
stranglehold on oil and free world economies and that hostages are
in jeopardy.
   Michel quoted Bush as saying, ``If we don't take heed now, we'll
pay dearly later.''
   Both Mitchell and Foley said that they agreed with Bush that
there should not be an emergency session of Congress to discuss
Persian Gulf policy. But the Senate announced Tuesday it would hold
hearings on the crisis and the House did the same today.
   But on Tuesday, two leading Republican senators endorsed the
idea of a special session.
   ``With the election over, the budget behind us, the American
people are starting to focus on this. We've lost some support. We
need to regain it,'' said Dole, R-Kan.
   Meanwhile, Bush today notified Congress that he was extending
for an additional 90 days the call-up for reservists already
serving in the Persian Gulf region.
   Tours of duty run for 90 days, renewable for another 90 days by
presidential order. Bush's action had been expected.
   The president said ``the effective support and conduct of
operational missions in and around the Arabian Peninsula
necessitates this action.''
   Today's session comes less than a week after Bush announced
200,000 new U.S. troops will be sent to the gulf region to provide
an ``offensive military option'' for use against Saddam Hussein's
Iraqi forces. About 230,000 U.S. troops are currently in the gulf
area.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee and a backer of the additional deployment, said the
announced buildup triggered a ``mini-firestorm of concern'' in
Congress.
   Following weekend sniping by several Democrats at the
president's gulf policy, Dole and other Republicans asked Bush on
Tuesday to convene an emergency session of Congress to vote on the
administration's position.
   ``I think it ought to be put up to the Congress - put up or shut
up,'' Dole said. ``And if they say no, well, then they say no. And
then the president has to decide whether to go it alone.''
   The White House publicly opposed a special session as
unnecessary since the nation is not at war. But Dole said later
Tuesday that Bush has not made up his mind and may decide after his
foreign trip late this month.
   Bush is scheduled to spend next week in Europe for the expected
signing of an arms control treaty, then visit U.S. troops in the
gulf and go on to Mexico for two days.
   Mitchell gave little support to the GOP call for a special
session, contending that such a step would be justified only if the
president decides to go to war. But he said the Armed Services and
Foreign Relations committees will hold hearings on the crisis in
the next several weeks.
   Traditionally, when Congress adjourns for the year it can be
called back into session only by the president. However, lawmakers
this year gave their own leaders the authority to call them back
after the Oct. 28 adjournment.
   In other gulf-related developments:
   -The Pentagon said it was raising the ceiling for naval
reservists called to active duty from 6,300 to 10,000.
   -The Pentagon announced that Marines are preparing to conduct
their first amphibious assault exercise in Saudi Arabia since being
sent to the gulf. Spokesman Pete Williams would not say where or
when the exercise will be held.
   -Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., and 21 other House Democrats
announced plans to file suit next week in federal court to keep
Bush from going on the offensive without congressional approval.
   -Baker, conferring with Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark in
Bermuda, told reporters, according to a transcript provided by the
State Department in Washington: ``The economic lifeline of the
industrial world runs from the (Persian) Gulf and we cannot permit
a dictator such as this to sit astride that economic lifeline. ...
let me say that means jobs'' of the average American citizen.

<HEAD>Secret Anti-Communist Network Exposed in Norway in 1978</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A secret network of trained resistance
fighters was exposed in Norway in 1978 when a policeman tracking
illegal moonshine stumbled on one of its arms caches.
   The network was set up in the late 1940s by people who saw Nazi
troops sweep away their ill-prepared resistance in World War II and
feared the Cold War could bring a Communist invasion.
   The Norwegian government confirmed the resistance network
existed during the inquiry that followed the discovery of the
weapons in 1978. At the same time, former CIA Director William
Colby published his memoirs and referred to such groups.
   ``It was a little surprising that no one in the other NATO
countries picked up on it, and raised questions about their own
countries,'' Nil Gleditzch of the International Peace Research
Institute in Oslo said Wednesday.
   Colby, who was stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Stockholm from
1951-1953, was quoted Wednesday by the Swedish news agency TT as
saying he helped form an armed anti-Communist guerrilla force in
``a Scandinavian country.'' He would not name the country.
   Officials in other NATO countries recently confirmed their own
anti-Communist cells, also established in the 1940 and 1950s, but
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has refused to say if it
played a role.
   In Italy, a group known as Operation Gladio is being
investigated for possible connections with right-wing terrorist
killings in the early 1980s.
   Gleditzch said Norway's groups are not suspected of such
wrongdoing.
   Hans Otto Meyer, an intelligence operative, was arrested in 1978
when an illegal still was found on his property. Police also
discovered at least 60 weapons, many machine guns, and 12,000
rounds of ammunition.
   Meyer's claim that Norwegian intelligence provided some of the
weapons, for use by a resistance cell, was eventually confirmed.
   Gleditzch said the reference in Colby's book stirred interest in
Norwy.
   Rolf Hansen, Norway's defense minister at the time, told
parliament the resistance groups were privately organized after the
war. Later, they were placed under the supervision of the
intelligence service, he said.
   The Norwegian underground network was not answerable to NATO or
other countries, Hansen said, dismissing any connection to the CIA.
But he would not discuss details, saying the organization's
activities had to be kept secret.
   Government officials remain secretive. Asked to confirm that the
groups are still active in Norway, Defense Ministry spokesman Erik
Senstad responded: ``What Hansen said then still applies.''
   Rear Admiral Jan Ingebrigtsen said the groups still existed in
1985, when he stepped down as head of the Norwegian Supreme Defense
Command's intelligence service.
   ``There is nothing suspicious about it. But these are units that
would stay behind in occupied territory and it is therefore
necessary that they be kept top secret,'' he told the Norwegian
news agency NTB.
   Christian Christensen, a former Norwegian intelligence officer,
wrote many books about the groups, as recently as this autumn. He
said private groups were formed in 1947, sometimes kept Communists
under surveillance and became part of the intelligence service in
1948.
   Norway, a sparsely populated country, expects trained citizen
soldiers to meet an invasion by arming themselves from thousands of
arms dumps in rural areas and the mountains.
   ``The idea is to have so many (caches) that it would be
impossible to knock out all of them,'' Senstad said.
   But Gleditzch said the so-called ``stay-behind'' groups are a
last line of defense, with their own weapons.
   ``It's separate from the other arms dumps. There are most likely
caches of weapons in closed-off rooms in people's basements,'' he
said in an interview.

   Sandpears from certain areas of Chile would be
available to American consumers under an Agriculture Department
proposal announced Wednesday.
   The pear variety would have to come from areas in Chile that
have been certified by USDA as being free of Mediterranean fruit
flies, highly destructive insect pests.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said most of Chile is believed
free of the Medfly, with only the northern provinces of Arica,
Iquique and Parinacota considered as infested.
   If the proposal is approved, he said, consumers would gain a
new, winter source of pears because the seasons in Chile are
opposite those in the United States.

   On the stage where Leonard Bernstein made his
sensational New York Philharmonic conducting debut 47 years ago,
the orchestra remembered the maestro at a concert that included
selections from his ``Mass'' and ``Chichester Psalms.''
   Wednesday's midday concert at Carnegie Hall also came on the
90th birthday of the late composer-conductor's close friend, Aaron
Copland. And it was the 36th anniversary of the first TV broadcast
by Bernstein, who died Oct. 16.
   Speakers, introducing various selections and often quoting from
Bernstein's writings, included Bernstein's three children,
son-in-law and friends Lauren Bacall and Schuyler Chapin.
   Bernstein's daughter Jamie Thomas said her father had loved
numerical coincidences ``and today there's a flock of them.''
   The concert began with selections from Bernstein's ``Mass,''
which he composed for the opening of the Kennedy Center for
Performing Arts in Washington, and ended with Psalm 133, in Hebrew,
from Bernstein's ``Chichester Psalms.''
   Conductors were Michael Tilson Thomas, Michael Barrett,
Christoph Eschenbach and James Levine. The orchestra played the
overture to Bernstein's ``Candide'' with a symbolically empty
podium, which brought tears to some of the invited audience and a
standing ovation.
   Cellist Mstislav Rostropovich played a Bach sarabande. Singers
were the Westminster Choir, mezzo-sopranos Marilyn Horne and
Christa Ludwig, soprano Clamma Dale, tenor Jerry Hadley and
baritones Thomas Hampson and Chester Ludgin.
   First chair musicians from the Boston Symphony, Israel
Philharmonic, London Symphony, Santa Cecilia Orchestra and Vienna
Philharmonic flew here, at their orchestras' expense, to take part.
   Two pieces by Copland were played. The concert also included
Schumann, Haydn and Mahler as well as excerpts from six Bernstein
works.
   Bernstein was the New York Philharmonic's 25-year-old assistant
conductor on Nov. 14, 1943, when he filled in at the last minute
for an ailing Bruno Walter.

<HEAD>Malcolm Muggeridge, British Media Celebrity, Dead at 87</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Malcolm Muggeridge, once Britain's best-known
media celebrity, died Wednesday at a nursing home in southern
England three months after suffering a stroke, his family said. He
was 87.
   Muggeridge was an agnostic who became a Roman Catholic when he
was nearly 80, and a youthful socialist who later mocked the trendy
left. He had one unchanging fascination - death.
   ``I rejoice in it, I love it. ... If it weren't for death, life
would be unbearable,'' Muggeridge said in a television appearance
seven years ago, without a trace of morbidness.
   Muggeridge delivered the remark with the same puckish smile and
twinkling eyes that enlivened his rigid views against
contraception, abortion, divorce and pornography.
   Some commentators dubbed him ``St. Mugg,'' while others said he
railed in old age against vices such as smoking, drinking and
adultery that he had enjoyed as a younger man.
   But for one who spent a long life talking, writing, pronouncing,
denouncing, laughing at himself and others and infuriating many in
the process, he earned a rare reward: few ever accused him of being
a bore or a hypocrite.
   Journalist, author, teacher, World War II spy for Britain's MI-6
counterintelligence service, editor and traveler, Muggeridge became
famous through television in the 1950s and 60s.
   His caustic commentaries, waspish views on post-imperial Britain
and a 1957 British Broadcasting Corp. ban for what was perceived as
an attack on the royal family, made him familiar to millions.
   He continued writing and interviewing after he moved in the
1960s to the Sussex village of Robertsbridge, where he lived with
his wife, Kitty, whom he married in 1927. He died in a Sussex
nursing home Wednesday.
   They had three surviving children - one son died - and nine
grandchildren.
   In middle life, Muggeridge, a heavy smoker and drinker - who
once said ``I just liked getting drunk'' - gave up both vices
because ``the old must choose between sainthood and suicide.''
   Muggeridge, a self-confessed unfaithful husband, later changes
his ways.
   ``Being unfaithful is the most despicable thing I have done in
my life,'' he said. ``But I always owned up in the end and Kitty
understands.''
   Through a career that included spells as a foreign correspondent
in Moscow and Washington, Muggeridge remained both fascinated and
repelled by politicians. He espoused no political cause but loathed
communism.
   That was due party to his experiences during a 1932-33
assignment in the Soviet Union as correspondent for Britain's
liberal Guardian newspaper.
   Muggeridge's religious odyssey was tormented but conclusive.
   He described that journey in his 1969 book, ``Jesus
Rediscovered,'' which he wrote after he decided to become a
committed Christian and a nominal member of the Church of England.
   ``Christianity to me is like a hopeless love affair,'' he
lamented in 1958. ``It is infinitely dear and infinitely
unattainable.''
   He described his conversion to Catholicism at age 80 as ``a
homecoming, picking up the lost threads of life.'' He had found he
couldn't take the Anglican church seriously.
   Thomas Malcolm Muggeridge was born into a lower middle-class
family and reared in south London. His father, Henry, a clerk in a
shirt-making firm, was a lifelong socialist and for two years a
Labor Party member of Parliament.
   After attending state schools, Muggeridge went to Cambridge
University and soon dropped his father's socialist views.
   He was mainly a free-lance journalist but also held high-powered
staff jobs such as the deputy editorship of Britain's conservative
Daily Telegraph, and editorship of the satirical magazine Punch.
   ``Life holds no more wretched occupation than trying to make the
English laugh,'' was his verdict on Punch.
   The best thing about being a journalist, he once said, was the
opportunity ``for contact with the eminent without being under the
necessity to admire them or take them seriously.''
   Winston Churchill was a ``disaster - he failed to notice the
British Empire was over,'' and John F. Kennedy was ``a fraud.'' But
Ronald Reagan was ``not such a fool as people say.''
   He saw Western civilization as doomed, the inevitability of
death as the most interesting aspect of life, and life itself as an
adventure, mystery and - ``for anyone of any sensitivity'' - a
disappointment.
   ``Human life, I have come to feel, in all its public or
collective manifestations is only theater, and mostly cheap
melodrama at that,'' he concluded.
   ``There is nothing serious under the sun except love; of
fellow-mortals and of God.''

   Scientists tested a nuclear weapon today after
security guards removed four protesters from the remote desert
site.
   Department of Energy officials spotted the protesters near
ground zero minutes before they planned to detonate the weapon. The
test was delayed while the protesters were taken from the site, 105
miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   The test controllers are ``obviously glad that it went, and went
without any prolonged delayes because of the infiltrators,'' said
Energy Department spokesman Jim Boyer said after the 11:17 a.m. EST
test.
   City Hall workers in downtown Las Vegas said the 10-story
building shook slightly. Boyer, at a control point 30 miles from
ground zero, said he felt a slight rolling motion.
   The protesters were arrested and taken to a base camp at
Mercury, Nev. They were to be turned over to Nye County
authorities.
   Earlier today, the environmental group Greenpeace said four
people had reached ground zero this morning in an attempt to halt
the test of the British nuclear weapon. The Energy Department
initially disputed the claim.
   The test, scheduled for 9 a.m., was delayed several times in the
final 30 minutes of the countdown because of technical
difficulties, Boyer said.
   The four protesters were spotted by video cameras trained on the
site as the countdown was about to resume with six minutes
remaining.
   The four - three British woman and an American man - reached the
area shortly after dawn, said Junior Bridge, a spokeswoman for
Greenpeace. She said one had made contact with a security guard
there.
   Energy Department spokesman Chris West had disputed the report,
saying there was no one at ground zero except the scientists who
arm the device.
   The nuclear device is buried 1,900 feet deep in a shaft filled
with concrete. Ground zero is the ground level spot above where the
underground explosion takes place.
   ``They could damn near be on top of it and it would just shake
them up a lot,'' Boyer said of possible intruders.
   West has said that someone standing on ground zero could receive
a jolt from the upward blast strong enough to break a leg.
   The device was expected to produce an explosive force of 20
kilotons to 150 kilotons of TNT. The atomic bomb that destroyed
Hiroshima had the force of 13 kilotons.
   Bridge identified the British protesters as Juley Howard, 23,
Jane Gregory, 27 and Lorna Richardson, 25, all of London. She said
Michael Perry, 27, of the Rocky Mountain Peace Center, was also
with the group. All British nuclear tests are conducted in Nevada.
Britain has conducted 17 nuclear tests in Nevada since 1958.
   Bridge, who identified herself as nuclear weapons program
coordinator for Greenpeace from Washington, D.C., said the women
were taken Sunday by Jeep to a point 20 miles from ground zero.
   The test site covers 1,350 square miles of rugged desert
terrain, an area larger than the state of Rhode Island.
   Anti-nuclear activists have hiked onto the site several times in
recent years. In most cases, the intruders have been arrested by
security forces who patrol by helicopter, airplane and all-terrain
vehicles.
   The department once launched extensive searches when activists
began penetrating in the id-1980s. They dropped the policy in 1986
as too costly.
   Department officials say an infiltrator reached ground zero only
once: Two years ago a man appeared near a detonation site just
minutes before a blast. The test was delayed an hour until the man
was picked up by helicopter.
   Today's test was the eighth this year at the Nevada site and the
707th since testing began there in 1951. The last test was Oct. 12.

   Congressional investigators said Wednesday the
tilt-rotor V-22 Osprey, a plane legislators told the Pentagon to
build over its objections, is too heavy and vibrated excessively in
early tests.
   The General Accounting Office said it's ``impossible to know at
this point'' whether the Osprey, which takes off like a helicopter
but flies like a plane, will be ready for production in 1992 as
scheduled.
   The agency expressed concern that the aircraft would be in
production at the same time it was being tested.
   However, the manufacturers of the Osprey - Bell Helicopter
Textron Inc. and Boeing Helicopter Co. - said ``the program is
ready to move forward.'' The production and testing schedule don't
pose a high risk, they said.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has said in his last two budget
proposals that the Osprey should be canceled, arguing that a mix of
conventional helicopters would be a cheaper alternative to the $23
million aircraft.
   Widespread support in Congress, especially in Texas and
Pennsylvania where the aircraft is being built, saved the Osprey
from the budget ax.
   President Bush earlier this month signed a military spending
bill for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. That bill included $238
million in research money for the V-22 and $165 million in
production funds.
   The provisions, added by Congress, also called for freeing $200
million for the program that had been included in the fiscal 1989
defense bill.
   Rep. Bill Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on the House
Armed Services Committee, released the Oct. 12 study by the GAO,
the investigative arm of Congress.
   The Defense Department largely concurred with the GAO findings,
and in a letter to Dickinson, Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald
Atwood reiterated that the department doesn't consider the program
affordable.
   The GAO found that early tests identified unacceptable vibration
during flight. The contractor designed a vibration reduction
package that has not yet been tested.
   As of Aug. 3, the agency said, the V-22 was expected to be about
2,822 pounds over the required weight. The contractor expects to
eliminate about 1,600 pounds during production, leaving about 1,200
pounds of excess weight.
   And the GAO reported that, as of Aug. 8, about 86 deficiencies
had been found during the first phase of government flight testing,
including 33 that were deemed as adversely affecting airworthiness,
crew effectiveness or safety, among other problems.
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., a member of the House Armed Services
Committee and a proponent of the aircraft that is built in his home
state, said flight testing of the Osprey has proceeded without any
major problems and should continue.
   ``While our Marines are training in the sands of Saudi Arabia,
we on Capitol Hill are discussing whether or not to provide them
with state-of-the-art equipment,'' he said.

   Five U.S. lawmakers warned Chinese leaders on
Wednesday that China could still lose its preferential trade status
if its human rights record does not improve, delegation members
said.
   ``We were trying to make the point with them that it was very
important how they handle the human rights issue,'' Rep. Jim
Lightfoot, R-Iowa, said at a news conference. He did not say how
the Chinese officials responded.
   The five lawmakers made up the first congressional delegation to
visit Beijing since June 1989, when Chinese troops opened fire on
pro-democracy demonstrators, killing hundreds and possibly
thousands of people. U.S. Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire
visited in Aug. 1989.
   They spoke on a day when China was savoring its role as host to
three visiting heads of state or government - its busiest day of
diplomatic activity in more than a year of semi-isolation.
   Indonesian President Suharto, Argentine President Carlos Menem
and Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan flew to Beijing after
attending the enthronement of Japanese Emperor Akihito in Tokyo.
   Indonesia, Argentina and Thailand were not vocal critics of
China's crackdown and did not take part in the Western boycott of
high-level contacts with Beijing. Their visits thus were not a
break with past policy.
   But they came at a time when Western countries as well are
healing their breach with China. The European Community decided
last month to end most of its sanctions against China, including
its ban on high-level visits, and the United States has been
gradually dismantling its sanctions.
   However, the U.S. congressional visit was not publicized until
the official Chinese media reported on it, and the U.S. Embassy at
first refused to provide information about the delegation.
   The congressmen said their mission was to stress to Chinese
leaders that the key to improved bilateral relations was the
resolution of human rights problems. In particular, they said China
should resolve the fate of the several hundred people still
imprisoned without trial for their participation in the democracy
protests.
   ``The incident that occurred in June of last year has not been
forgotten,'' said Rep. Michael G. Oxley, R-Ohio. ``Many of us
wanted to express in person our outrage.''
   The group also included Reps. E. Clay Shaw, a Republican from
Florida, George W. Darden, a Democrat from Georgia, and Rep. John
J. Rhodes III, an Arizona Republican.
   Bilateral trade dominated their talks with Premier Li Peng and
other leaders, who initiated discussions about China's most-favored
nation trade status, they said.
   The United States granted China the preferential treatment a
decade ago, substantially lowering tariffs on Chinese products.
President Bush renewed the status last May despite public pressure
to punish Beijing. The House of Representatives has tried to
reverse Bush's decision or to link the status with human rights
improvements.
   Rhodes said that after their meetings Chinese leaders realized
Congress will look for a ``final resolution'' of last year's
crackdown when considering the future of bilateral trade.
   ``That means they make a final determination of the fate of
those who are still in captivity,'' Rhodes said. ``We made that
point over and over again.''
   Authorities say 355 people remain jailed and under investigation
in Beijing, but they refuse to say how many others have been
sentenced or what the figures are nationwide.
   Some of the lawmakers said they thought Li indicated the cases
of jailed dissidents would be resolved quickly, but others in the
delegation disputed that interpretation. No one was able to quote
the premier.
   The lawmakers also discussed the crisis in the Persian Gulf with
Chinese leaders, but said they had no indication how China would
vote on a U.N. resolution endorsing the use of force to compel Iraq
to withdraw from Kuwait.

   Gov. Stan Stephens called out the
National Guard today to help firefighters battle a fire that
threatened homes, hunters and ranches along the Missouri River.
   At least 30 homes were evacuated and a dozen hunters jumped into
a creek to avoid getting burned as the 30,000-acre blaze raged
uncontrolled though steep timber, small canyons and grassland near
the river in western Montana.
   ``People that have been around fires for 30 years have told me
this is the most unusal thing they have ever seen,'' said Dennis
Casey, commissioner of state lands. ``There's so many hunters in
there and it happened so quickly.''
   No injuries were reported, but officials said they were
concerned about hunters in the area, which is a popular hunting
spot for deer, elk and bear.
   The fire began Tuesday night in two areas of the state-owned
Beartooth Game Management Range north of Helena. Fire officials
said record-high temperatures, extremely dry conditions for
mid-November and high wind contributed to the fire's rapid spread.
   Bob LaSalle, one of about two dozen hunters who fled the fire,
said a hunter in another camp told him the fire started from a
spark from a cookstove.
   ``The cinders were falling on us,'' said Lynn Dumas of Big
Sandy, another hunter. ``We had five minutes' warning. Just about
enough time to saddle a horse. When we left we could feel the
heat.''
   About 40 guardsmen were sent to the fire lines with heavy trucks
and other equipment to help 400 firefighters.
   About 200 miles to the northeast, another 200 firefighters were
battling a 35,000-acre fire burning in grass and scattered timber
on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation. The fire started Sunday
evening in a landfill in the reservation community of Lodgepole,
officials said.
   The fire was thought to be contained Monday, but high winds
whipped it out of control on Tuesday.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) - A woman who prosecutors said
spoon-fed her boyfriend home-cooked food laced with aroo travelers with
an aggressive marketing campaign that includes heavily discounted
seats for vacationers and first-class upgrades for anyone paying
full coach fare.
   Eastern's traffic figures show more passengers are flying the
airline, but it's still confronting enormous obstacles besides
angry creditors and a debt exceeding $1 billion.
   Perhaps the most critical immediate problem is fuel expenses,
which have nearly doubled since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait Aug.
2. Because Eastern is so weak financially, the impact of that
unforeseen cost increase has hurt Eastern more severely than many
of its rivals.
   As Eastern's fate was being determined in Lifland's court,
travel agents expressed mixed views on the wisdom of purchasing its
tickets. Some were advising customers that it might be better to
make reservations with other carriers.
   ``We have warned them definitely that the bankruptcy judge could
close them down,'' said William Cooper, president of Adventure
Travels in Pompano Beach, Fla. ``The problem is that most of the
people have bought their tickets for the Thanksgiving or Christmas
holidays in advance.''
   Cooper doubts Eastern's competitors would have any incentive to
offer good deals to any travelers who might get stuck with
worthless Eastern tickets. People who bought early tickets at
cheaper fares might wind up shelling out more cash for expensive
tickets bought close to their departure dates, he said.
   ``Some of the other carriers may say, `Hey, why are we going to
give special promotional fares?''' Cooper said.
   At JB's World Travel in New York, owner Jack Bloch had a
different view.
   ``The far-reaching thing of Eastern going under wouldn't affect
most people,'' Bloch said. ``The fare loads on all the carriers are
very light. The flights are wide open. I would think most of the
carriers would allow people to fly standby.''
   Several hours before Eastern and the creditors had their court
date, Bloch said he would have no qualms about selling Eastern
tickets.

   Germany and Poland signed a treaty
Wednesday under which Germany permanently surrendered its claim to
40,000 square miles of territory lost in World War II - about
one-third of present-day Poland.
   The pact, signed by Foreign Ministers Hans-Dietrich Genscher for
Germany and Krzysztof Skubiszewski for Poland, ended one of the
most intractable diplomatic disputes of the postwar era.
   Although the treaty has long been one of Poland's chief foreign
policy goals, Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki avoided
conveying any sense of triumph at the signing ceremony.
   He instead stressed sympathy for the ``tragedy'' of millions of
Germans roughly expelled from their former homeland at the end of
the war.
   By recognizing the border on the Oder and Neisse rivers, Germany
gives up any claims to historically German lands in Pomerania,
Silesia and East Prussia now populated mainly by Poles.
   The victorious Allies turned over the land to Poland in 1945 to
make up for an even greater expanse of Polish territory taken in
the east by the Soviet Union.
   As a price for international consent to reunification this year,
Germany agreed to make the border permanent.
   ``The decision we have made ... is not an easy one for us
Germans, for any of us - including myself,'' Genscher said after
signing the treaty. ``And for those who have lost their home lands,
who suffered expulsion, it is an especially painful one.''
   The 2{-page treaty called for building ``a peaceful European
order, in which borders will not divide.''
   ``The Germans are not forwarding any territorial demands and
will not forward any in the future,'' Genscher said.
   Because the frontier is now safe, Poles and Germans can put
aside ``mistrust'' and ``meet on a new footing,'' he said. He
repeated a promise to lift the visa requirement for visiting Poles
by year's end.
   ``I am glad we have this stage behind us,'' said Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa, the front-running candidate in this month's
presidential election, who met with Genscher. ``Let's lift visas
and other obstacles and there will be no problems.''
   Mazowiecki took pains to address German concerns in what
appeared to be the strongest apology ever made by a Polish
statesman to those who lost their homes.
   ``The suffering of the German nation must be spoken about,'' he
said. ``Every harm remains a harm, every tragedy remains a tragedy,
irrespective of the harms and tragedies that we ourselves
experienced.''
   Johann Kroll, a leader of the Polish German minority present at
the signing, said the treaty ``does not create too much joy for
us.''
   ``However, it is necessary,'' he said. ``The present borders ...
we consider to be temporary because we count on the fact that ...
borders will vanish in the common Europe.''
   Kroll was referring to efforts by the European Community to
achieve greater unity among European nations.
   Under a timetable agreed to by Kohl and Mazowiecki, the border
treaty will be ratified by the end of February by parliaments of
both countries.
   Meanwhile, a broader friendship treaty is to be prepared for
ratification at the same time. The pact will contain assurances of
minority rights for the up to 1 million ethnic German citizens of
Poland.
   The Polish-German border was defined at Postdam in August 1945
by the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States. By that time,
the Soviets had installed an obedient government in Poland and were
occupying eastern Germany.
   After the Germans were deported, millions more Poles from the
east moved into the new territory from homes that had fallen within
the expanded borders of the Soviet Union. Names of towns were
changed to Polish, and monuments and other signs of the area's
German past were removed.
   By putting the border so deep in former German territory, Soviet
leader Josef Stalin partly compensated the Poles for his own land
seizures, punished Germany for the war and bound Poland to Moscow
as the ultimate guarantor of its western frontier.
   Communist East Germany recognized the Oder-Neisse line in 1950
and West Germany disavowed any territorial claims in 1970. But
conservatives and politically influential associations of expelled
Germans pressed for decades to regain all or part of Germany's lost
territories.

   The government said Wednesday it is lifting
controls on the prices of luxury goods in an effort to encourage
production. Only hours later, Russia's parliament declared the
decree void in the largest of the 15 Soviet republics.
   The move by the Russian Federation set up the latest struggle in
the war between the central Soviet and Russian governments. It
demonstrated the fragmentation and confusion plaguing the Soviet
Union as the base of power moves from the Kremlin to the republics.
   The battle began with a decree by the national Council of
Ministers that prices would be freed on goods ``of no essential
influence on people's living standards'' - such as jewelry,
furniture and American cigarettes.
   It marked the first time in decades that the government has
completely freed an entire range of retail prices to respond to the
market forces of supply and demand.
   Floating prices is an important element in the government's
outline for converting the Soviet Union from a centrally planned
economy - in which the government sets all prices often regardless
of the cost of production - to a free market economy.
   The council's decree applied to some of the items most in
demand. Their prices have been fixed but in fact many of the goods
are sold above the official price by corrupt store employees who
sell them, truckers who deliver them and factory workers who make
them.
   Shoppers have to wait as long as 10 years to receive furniture
at the official price, but can get it immediately if they are
willing to pay three times that rate.
   Other goods covered by the decree, which was released by the
Tass news agency, are: natural furs, carpets, high-tech
electronics, cut glassware, china, spare car parts and imports such
as whiskey, gin and American cigarettes. Certain meat products and
fish delicacies are also included.
   To prevent panic buying like that which preceded a round of
price hikes planned for July 1 - and later canceled - the
government announced the action just one day before it was to take
effect, on Thursday.
   The government said freeing prices would ``provide extra
incentives to increase the production of consumer goods and
saturate the market.'' It also said the measure would undermine the
black market for the items.
   The decree drew immediate criticism.
   ``I consider it pointless,'' radical legislator Gennady Filshin
told the Russian Federation's parliament. An account of his remarks
by the independent news agency Interfax did not report his reasons
for opposing the move.
   The Russian Council of Ministers, in its retaliation, said the
national decree has no force on Russian territory and forbade sale
of the affected goods until further notice. It said wine, vodka and
tobacco goods would continue to be sold at current, state-fixed
prices.
   It ordered an inventory of the affected goods to be conducted
for the purpose of preserving them, and said local government
leaders would be held personally responsible for the results.
   Even a member of the national Council of Ministers, which
adopted the decree, criticized it.
   Deputy Prime Minister Stepan Sitaryan said there would be many
``bruises.'' He predicted that prices of the goods affected would
double, and that there would be a chain reaction that would drive
up the prices of other goods. He said some businesses might
intentionally decrease production to drive up prices artificially,
so they can get a higher profit.
   Many of these problems, he said, could have been avoided if
prices were freed simultaneously with a move to privatize
businesses and end the state monopoly of the economy.
   As the old central planning system collapses, hidden inflation
and hoarding have exacerbated many perennial shortages and created
new ones.
   Soviets have been hoarding anything with lasting value,
including many of the goods whose prices are being raised in the
decree.
   Many people are particularly worried about the coming winter. A
public opinion poll published in an edition of the weekly Moscow
News, released Wednesday, said 62 percent of those questioned fear
hunger in the next few months. Twenty-six percent had no fear and
12 percent did not know.
   The poll, conducted by the All-Union Center of Study of Public
Opinion, did not give a margin of error.
   An accompanying open letter by a group of prominent politicians
and economists said the government should head off difficulties
this winter by opening strategic reserves saved in the event of
war.
   ``The country is slipping into an abyss, a civil war,'' they
warned. ``Unless a number of urgent, decisive measures are taken, a
tragedy will be inevitable.''

   The 1973 War Powers Act requires that the
president consult with Congress formally when U.S. forces are
introduced ``into hostilities or into situations where imminent
involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the
circumstances.''
   Notification also is required when combat-equipped troops are
sent to the territory of any foreign nation.
   The notification must include the president's explanation of why
the move is necessary and the estimated scope and duration of the
deployment.
   The law requires that the president terminate the military
deployment within 60 days unless Congress has specifically
authorized its continuation. The 60-day period can be extended to
90 days if the president certifies that such a move is ``an
unavoidable military necessity.''
   Administrations regard the act as an unconstitutional
infringement by Congress on the president's powers as
commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Rather than tackle the
issue head-on, however, notification usually is given in a way that
Congress regards as compliance with the law.

are growing along with the threat of war.
   Eighteen demonstrators were arrested Tuesday for investigation
of trespassing and malicious mischief after a group of activists
protesting the American military presence in the Middle East
occupied the ROTC building at the University of California,
Berkeley.
   While many Americans support the buildup in the Persian Gulf,
others say they worry the country is repeating the mistakes of
Vietnam.
   ``I don't think there's a clear recognition of the cost, the
human cost of going to war,'' said Paul Wright, a former war
protester and an editor at the University of Massachusetts press.
He has a son stationed with the Marines in the gulf.
   Protesters have marched in Fargo, N.D., held peace vigils in New
Haven, Conn., and poured oil and simulated blood over a mound of
sand in front of San Francisco's Presidio, an Army base since 1846.
   Quakers and Buddhist monks have been gathering at the gates of
Westover since August, their numbers growing from two or three to
about 50 on Monday.
   ``I think as long as the president is beating the war drums and
not wanting to have a full discussion of this in Congress, people
are getting angrier and angrier,'' Frances Crow, a 71-year-old
Quaker, said Tuesday.
   Much of the concern seems to focus on how Congress has not voted
on the military action.
   ``I'm concerned that we're starting to make that leap of faith
from supporting our troops to supporting this policy of the
president,'' said Dean R. Kahler, who was paralyzed after being
shot at the Kent State demonstration of 1970.
   Now a county commissioner in Athens, Ohio, Kahler echoed calls
for Congress to reconvene. ``I think its important that Congress
exercise its responsibility and not duck it,'' he said. ``I think
they ducked it in the Vietnam era.''
   Last week's decision to send up to 200,000 more troops to the
gulf seemed to have raised concern that the United States is trying
to assume anew the role of world policeman, said Marty Linsky, a
lecturer in public policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government.
   As in the Vietnam era, much of the protest is student-based,
from the sporadic demonstrations at Berkeley to a peace vigil at
Yale University on Sunday. Fifteen of those arrested in Berkeley
were students.
   But unlike the 1960s, many of the demonstrators are veterans
themselves, GIs who felt the ignominy of fighting in an unpopular
war.
   ``I'm afraid they're going to go to war and going to kill a
bunch of good young men for really nothing,'' said Leonard
Lavender, a Korean War veteran who participated in Sunday's
Veterans Day observance in Bozeman, Mont.
   ``Wait'll they start sending gung-ho women back in body bags,''
Lavender said.
   On the other side of the issue, several support groups are
launching letter-writing and gift campaigns.
   A group in Minneapolis plans to collect 10,000 pounds of gifts
to U.S. troops in the gulf. ``Some of them don't have any family,''
Roberta Nathe of New Hope said. ``We're going to be their adopted
family.''
   In Arizona, Operation Santa Claus will send gifts to soldiers
deployed from Fort Huachuca, an Army base in Sierra Vista.
   There are about 230,000 U.S. troops in and around Saudi Arabia
and an up to 200,000 more are expected.
   ``I wish they'd go ahead and do it and get it over with,'' said
Rosa Lee, who owns a record and video store in Camden, S.C.
   Gen. William C. Westmoreland of Charleston, S.C., commander in
Vietnam, said he believes the United States is not ready for
battle.
   ``But we are moving into the position to be prepared,'' he said.

<HEAD>Moslems And Sikhs Attack Hindu Neighborhood, Five Killed</HEAD>

   Moslems and Sikhs waving swords and
firing revolvers attacked a Hindu neighborhood in the capital
Wednesday, and police opened fire to halt the rampage. At least
five people died.
   At least three of those killed were Hindus who died of stab
wounds. Two people died from bullet wounds, the United News of
India reported. Twenty-five people were reported injured, including
eight policemen. Most of the injuries were stab wounds and gashes
from swords, police said.
   Santosh K. Kain, a police commissioner, said three Hindu-owned
shops and 10 vehicles were burned by the attackers.
   After the fighting, at least 20 men were detained by police.
   The trouble began when about 15,000 Sikhs and Moslems held a
meeting in a mosque to express solidarity against the Hindu
majority. Police said some of those who addressed the group made
``provocative speeches.''
   A group of people, waving swords, daggers and revolvers, left
the meeting and attacked a Hindu neighborhood about 500 yards away,
Kain said.
   Some Hindus pelted the attackers with stones, residents said.
The rioting in the capital's Sadar Bazaar neighborhood lasted about
a half hour, they said.
   ``They came in a Matador (van) with naked swords and brandishing
revolvers,'' said Vinod Kumar, a 22-year-old Hindu. ``They shouted
provocative slogans....''
   Kumar spoke to reporters in front of a burning two-story house,
which he said belonged to a Hindu. Bricks and pieces of glass lay
on the street amid pools of water.
   Hindu fundamentalism has been on the increase in India and
peaked two weeks ago in the northern town of Ayodhya. The
fundamentalists stormed a mosque in the town, claiming it was the
birthplace of Lord Rama, a Hindu warrior-god.
   More than 380 people, mostly Moslems, have been killed across
India in violence sparked by the Hindu campaign.
   Residents said about 35 percent of Sadar Bazaar's residents are
Moslems and most of the rest are Hindus. A few Sikhs also live in
the middle-class area.
   Hindus comprise 82 percent of India's 880 million people.
Moslems make up 12 percent, while Sikhs are about 2 percent.
Buddhists and Christians make up the rest.

   Cigarettes increase smokers' pain tolerance and
could therefore block the chest pains that serve as a warning for
heart disease, researchers said Wednesday.
   In studies with 20 male smokers, ages 19 to 44, the researchers
found that the tolerance to pain increased with each of three
cigarettes smoked.
   The study, presented at the annual meeting of the Amerian Heart
Association, was conducted by asking the smokers to keep away from
cigarettes for 12 hours and then smoke three cigarettes at timed
intervals. A hot probe was touched to their arms after each
cigarette and warmed until it reached the threshhold temperature
that produced pain, said Dr. Paula Miller of the University of
North Carolina School of Medicine, the principal author of the
study.
   A statistically significant rise in the temperatures the men
could tolerate occurred after they smoked the cigarettes, she said.
   ``We have a lot of confidence in our findings because the
responses were so consistent,'' said the senior author of the
study, Dr. David Sheps, also of the University of North Carolina.
   ``Almost every man showed increases in threshhold and tolerance
temperatures immediately after smoking a cigarette,'' he said.
   Smokers are known to have a higher prevalence of what is called
``silent ischemia,'' said Miller.
   Silent ischemia occurs when blood flow to the heart is briefly
interrupted because of the buildup of fatty deposits and
cholesterol in the arteries that nourish the heart.
   In many people, ischemia produces the chest pain known as
angina, which is an indicator of heart disease. In silent ischemia,
however, there is no pain to call attention to the underlying heart
disease.
   Miller has been trying to understand why silent ischemia occurs,
and she said that the pain-masking effects of smoking might explain
why it is more common in smokers.
   In another study, she showed that the naturally occuring
pain-relieving substances called endorphins also may help mask the
pain associated with ischemia.
   People whose bodies naturally produce more endorphins may be
more likely to suffer from silent ischemia, she said.
   The American Heart Association estimates that 2{ million
Americans suffer from angina. As many as 3 million or 4 million
Americans may suffer from silent ischemia, the heart association
estimates.

   President Bush bestowed a presidential pardon
Wednesday on a fat, white turkey, sending the gobbler to a
children's petting farm instead of the Thanksgiving table.
   ``After everything that's been going on in Washington, it's
great to share the stage with someone I can call a turkey and get
away with it,'' Bush said as he acceted the 60-pound bird.
   ``I'm going to give you a presidential pardon,'' Bush said to
the fowl from the farm of National Turkey Federation President
Wyatt Upchurch of Raeford, N.C.
   The bird will live out its days at the Kidwell Farm in Herndon,
Va.
   The turkey accepted the honor without a peep, sitting placidly
on a little table in the Rose Garden while the president and
several elementary school children stroked its feathery neck.
   Bush selected Macey Roberts, a third grader at New Hampshire
Estates Elementary School in Montgomery County, Md., and fourth
grader Ariel Lopez, of Key Elementary in Arlington, Va., to be the
first ``turkey patters.''
   ``Is he kind of calm?'' Bush asked as he stepped close to the
bird. ``We had one a couple of years ago that started jumping
around and scared all the kids.''
   Last year, at the annual pre-Thanksgiving presidential turkey
presentation, the bird gobbled so loudly that Bush had trouble
being heard over it.
   One of the birds presented to former President Reagan flapped
wildly during that year's Rose Garden ceremony.
   This year's turkey, however, went from crate to viewing stand to
the ground for petting without a sound or flutter.
   Outside a White House gate were two animal rights protesters,
one dressed as a turkey.
   ``We're here to speak for the 45 million turkeys who will die
this Thanksgiving,'' said Robin Walker, of Hyattsville, Md. ``
President Bush needs to recognize that turkeys have a right to life
free of pain. He needs to recognized his vegetarian constituency.''

<HEAD>Gov. Wilder Sees Someone Like Himself as Ideal '92 Nominee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virginia Gov. Doug Wilder lambasted President
Bush's fiscal and civil rights policies Wednesday and all but
declared himself the ideal Democratic nominee to take on Bush in
1992.
   Wilder, speaking at a luncheon sponsored by the conservative
National Review magazine, depicted himself as far more fiscally
conservative than Bush and said the Democrats must nominate such a
person to regain the White House.
   The Virginia governor, the first black to be elected head of any
state, also tied Bush to Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and said the two
had reduced GOP conservatism to ``false symbolism and intimidation
tactics.''
   Wilder's associates have formed a political action committee the
governor says is designed to aid fiscally responsible candidates.
The PAC could be turned into a Wilder presidential committee if he
declared his candidacy.
   Sounding themes that could easily become campaign slogans,
Wilder said the Bush-Helms axis represents ``the new extremism'' as
opposed to his own ``new mainstream.''
   ``The new mainstream brings people together, while the new
extremism pulls Americans apart,'' he said. ``The new extremism
spouts mighty rhetoric about fiscal responsibility and balanced
budgets, but then embraces a trillion dollar federal debt and
sky-high taxes on Middle America and Forgotten America.''
   Wilder said Bush demonstrated ``a willingness to mortgage the
moral authority of the White House'' by vetoing the 1990 civil
rights bill and aligning himself with Helms.
   ``He needed something to hold his 1988 coalition together and
the senator needed something - anything - to hold on to his seat in
Washington,'' Wilder said.
   This year's civil rights act was designed to restore broad job
protections for women and minorities that had been eroded by
several recent Supreme Court decisions. Bush said he vetoed the
bill because it would have led to hiring quotas.
   Participants in a panel before Wilder spoke, notably former New
York Mayor Ed Koch, said the bill surely would have led to quotas.
They also said the GOP has a central and winning issue in the
affirmative action question, at least until Democrats rethink their
position.
   Proponents of the civil rights bill vehemently deny it would
lead to quotas.
   Wilder accused Bush of falsely raising that specter and laying
the groundwork for a devastating Helms ad against his black
Democratic opponent, Harvey Gantt, in the closing days of the
campaign.
   ``As one who has had some real experience with real racial quota
laws, let me say that the Civil Rights Act of 1990 is not one of
those laws,'' Wilder said.
   Turning to economic matters, Wilder charged the Reagan and Bush
administrations with tripling the national debt, decimating the
dollar and creating structural deficits that are still out of
control.
   By contrast, he cited his own record of spending cuts and
reordered priorities in Virginia.
   He then described his vision of a victorious 1992 Democratic
presidential nominee: ``a candidate with proven fiscal management
credentials; a candidate able and willing to make the tough choices
at home and abroad.''
   Asked his views on the Persian Gulf, Wilder said he had been
encouraging Bush to better explain why the United States is in the
Middle East, what it hopes to accomplish there and what further
help it expects to get from allies.
   ``I support the president's positions. The question is, where
are we going from here,'' he said, echoing a common Democratic
view.
   Wilder sounded less like his party brethren and more like Helms
when he was asked about the controversy involving the National
Endowment for the Arts.
   ``There is no constitutionally protected right to obscenity,''
he said. ``Funding for the arts is one thing. Funding for obscenity
is another.''

<HEAD>Broadway Opening of `Shogun' Postponed After Leading Man Injured</HEAD>

   The Broadway opening of ``Shogun'' was postponed
Wednesday until Nov. 20 after a piece of scenery fell on the
musical's leading man during a performance and slightly injured
him.
   Philip Casnoff suffered minor injuries Tuesday night, said Sam
Rudy, a spokesman for the show.
   ``He's going to be all right,'' Rudy said.
   Rudy said the Wednesday matinee and evening performances were
canceled, but preview performances will resume Thursday. The
official opening, originally set for Nov. 15, was pushed back to
Tuesday.
   The audience at the Marquis Theater screamed when the screen
fell to the stage, grazing Casnoff on his head, Rudy said. No one
else, on or off-stage, was injured.
   The performance was a benefit for Montefiore Medical Center in
The Bronx.
   A doctor in the audience scrambled to the stage and examined
Casnoff, Rudy added.
   ``The show was so exciting and the special effects so
unbelievable that when I saw something coming from above, I thought
it was part of the show,'' said Dr. Berish Strauch, who was sitting
in the 10th row.
   ``It struck the leading man, Mr. Casnoff, and he dropped to the
ground and just lay there,'' said Strauch, head of the department
of plastic and reconstructive surgery at Montefiore Hospital and
the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. ``I realized quickly that
he was hurt and that this was not part of the show, so I ran to the
stage.''
   The doctor said Casnoff probably was unconscious for about 15-20
seconds but when he examined him, the actor was able to move his
arms and legs. Casnoff was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital where he
was treated for bruises and then released. He suffered minor
injuries to the face and neck.
   Casnoff was the lavish musical's second leading man. Peter
Karrie, the original star, was fired during the musical's
Washington tryout. In ``Shogun,'' Casnoff plays a 17th century
English sailor shipwrecked in Japan. The musical is based on James
Clavell's epic novel that became a successful television miniseries
starring Richard Chamberlain. The book and lyrics for ``Shogun''
were written by John Driver and the music is by Paul Chihara.

   Consumers have plenty of turkeys for this
Thanksgiving and more are on the way next year, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesday.
   An outlook report said stockpiles of frozen turkeys Sept. 30
were at near-record levels, up 8 percent from a year ago. And
production in the October-December quarter is forecast to be up 5
percent.
   Further, the report said, 1991 turkey output is expected to rise
6 percent from this year, compared with a 1990 increase of 9
percent.
   Retail prices are averaging slightly higher than a year ago,
said Larry Witucki of the department's Economic Research Service.
   ``It's hard to predict exactly, because we don't know what the
retailers' special strategy will be in any particular year,'' he
said.
   In the last quarter of 1989, retail prices of whole turkeys
nationally averaged about 96 cents per pound, Witucki said.
   ``About all I can say is that it's another year of ample
supplies in stores, at reasonable prices - but those may be a
little higher,'' he said.
   Supermarkets in the Washington, D.C., area are offering specials
on whole turkeys this week at prices ranging from 66 cents to 89
cents per pound.
   The 1990 turkey crop will total more than 281 million birds and
produce an estimated 4.7 billion pounds of turkey meat, Witucki
said. Not all of it will be sold as whole birds.
   Processors have developed many ways of selling turkeys,
including turkey luncheon meats, turkey ham and turkey sausage. And
there are the turkey parts such as breasts, drumsticks and thighs
for those not wanting whole birds or certain kinds of meat.
   That has helped make turkey an item throughout the year, not
just during the holiday season in the fall.
   About 35 percent of the turkey business still occurs in the last
three months of the year, Witucki said. In 1960, almost 60 percent
of the annual total came in the fourth quarter.
   Projections by USDA show per capita turkey consumption this year
may average a record 18.3 pounds, retail weight, up from an average
of 17.1 pounds per person in 1989. It could rise to 19.3 pounds in
1991.
   Total poultry consumption is projected by USDA at 90 pounds per
person this year, rising to 94.7 in 1991. Broilers lead the pack
with 69.6 pounds in 1990 and 73.3 pounds in 1991.
   Red meat consumption is estimated at 130.4 pounds per person in
1990, rising to 132 pounds next year. Beef is the leader at 67.8
pounds and will remain at about that level in 1991, according to
the department. Pork, at 60.1 pounds, is projected at 61.7 in 1991.
   The USDA report said hams are in shorter supply this season,
with Sept. 30 inventories down 22 percent from a year earlier.
   Wholesale ham prices rose to more than $1 per pound in late
September ``but have not exhibited the typical strong seasonal
upward pattern this fall,'' the report said.

   Several New Jersey public housing commissions
ignored housing authority executives who drew excessive salaries
and wasted federal money, according to a report Wednesday by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   New Jersey was cited for the most egregious abuses in the
report, which included 17 recommendations for the more than 3,100
public housing authorities nationwide, said Joseph G. Schiff,
assistant secretary for public and Indian housing.
   ``I don't think there's anything of the depth in New Jersey
elsewhere in the United States,'' said Schiff.
   The report also included reviews of housing authorities in
Atchison, Kan.; Bremerton, Wash.; Montgomery, Ala.; San Bernardino,
Calif.; Santa Fe, N.M.; Stamford, Conn.; York, Pa.; and Youngstown,
Ohio.
   Schiff said Housing Secretary Jack Kemp on Wednesday sent
letters to chairmen of all public housing boards asking them to
give poor tenants a bigger role in housing management. He also
wrote to mayors, city councils and governors who appoint housing
officials outlining the type of experience housing board members
should have.
   ``It is quite apparent that some executive directors and
commissioners in New Jersey have treated their PHAs as private
kingdoms, to the ultimate detriment of the residents and the
American taxpayer,'' wrote Schiff, chairman of a special New Jersey
strike force created by Housing Secretary Jack Kemp.
   ``You've got isolated instances that just blow me away, that I'm
confident are not common practice,'' Schiff said.
   Kemp created the strike force on Jan. 22 after the discovery of
more than $1.7 million misappropriated by the Passaic, N.J.,
Housing Authority, including multiple salaries paid to Paul A.
Marguglio, the executive director. He and other executives
subsequently pleaded guilty to criminal charges including
conspiracy, perjury and tax evasion.
   The report found that many commissioners, believing HUD
officials would advise them of problems within their authorities,
merely rubber-stamped activities by their executive directors.
   The task force found problems ranging from contracts assigned
without competitive bidding and salaries paid without records of
hours worked to cost overruns and excessive travel.
   Among the wasteful practices chronicled were:
   - The Irvington, N.J., Housing Authority purchased a $26,290
automobile and paid a consultant $1,570 in connection with the
purchase when the authority already had leased another car of the
same model. The agency also had three pickup trucks available for
staff use, although all of the authority's units are within walking
distance of the administrative offices.
   - The North Bergen Housing Authority paid $12,600 for meals and
drinks of board members and authority members before, during and
after commission meetings from Aug. 22, 1988, to Jan. 18, 1990.
   The report recommends:
   - Tighter HUD guidelines on salaries and administrative costs.
   - A departmental policy to restrict the hiring of relatives. For
example, reviewers found 22 related employees at the Housing
Authority of North Bergen.
   - A review of methods for auditing the housing agencies.
   - Guidelines for legal services contracts.
   Losses from HUD abuses and mismanagement during the Reagan
administration may cost taxpayers up to $2 billion. A
court-appointed special prosecutor is now investigating former
Secretary Samuel Pierce and other former HUD officials.

   Arizonans aren't sure who their governor will be
in January or even when they'll get a permanent head of a ship of
state buffeted since 1985 by presidential ambitions, political
beheadings and personal indecision.
   There may be more storms on the horizon.
   ``Rudderless?'' House minority leader Art Hamilton asked with a
smile. ``We certainly have a rudder. It just seems at times that
it's broken and that's why we're going around in circles.''
   Hamilton is the only lawmaker still in the same leadership post
he had in 1986. By January, the only other ongoing state-level
political leader, Attorney General Bob Corbin, will be gone as well
- to retirement.
   A political vacuum isn't the state's only problem.
   The state's business elite has crumbled, led by the collapse of
financier-developer Charles Keating Jr.'s empire, savings and loan
failures, and financial troubles besetting such major companies as
convenience store giant Circle K and electricity producer Arizona
Public Service Co.
   The sports establishment also is reeling as the National
Football League and Fiesta Bowl try to deal with voter rejection of
a paid state holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr. The NFL is
threatening to take away the 1993 Super Bowl, and the Fiesta Bowl
spoke briefly of leaving as well.
   The state's lame-duck Legislature is trying to write rules this
week and next for a gubernatorial runoff early next year between
Republican Fife Symington and Democrat Terry Goddard.
   Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, a caretaker elevated when
Republican Gov. Evan Mecham was impeached in 1988 after a
particularly stormy period, may stay on past the Jan. 7 end of her
term. Or she may turn over the reins to fellow Democrat Dick
Mahoney, elected last week to his first term as secretary of state,
Arizona's equivalent of a lieutenant governor.
   Mofford first said she intended to run for a full term. But
then, after Mecham had set off a storm by making a bid for
re-election, she added to the turmoil by changing her mind. She has
been criticized for her lack of decision and described as the
``stealth'' governor for her low profile and lack of programs.
   Symington beat Goddard 49.7 percent to 49.3 percent last week.
But the write-in candidacy of a Mecham lieutenant deprived him of
the absolute majority needed to avoid a runoff under a previously
untested constitutional amendment inspired by Mecham's surprise
election.
   Though voters approved the amendment, lawmakers did nothing to
say how it should work.
   Even if the lame-duck lawmakers agree on a runoff for late
January or February and overcome a court challenge filed by
Symington supporters, there's more turbulence ahead when the new
legislature convenes in early January and faces a $300 million
deficit.
   After more than a decade in which Republicans controlled both
legislative chambers, voters last week gave Democrats a 17-13 edge
in the Senate while leaving Republicans in charge of the House,
33-27.
   ``We could be facing legislative paralysis at the start of the
year without any executive leadership,'' said Dana Larsen,
executive director of Arizona Common Cause.
   The state's political sea began getting choppy in 1985, when
Gov. Bruce Babbitt, a Democrat, began running for president and
pushed for a King holiday in a state where blacks are only 3
percent of the population.
   Frustrated by repeated lack of legislative action, Babbitt
proclaimed a paid King holiday for executive-branch employees.
   Corbin issued a non-binding opinion that the proclamation was
illegal, saying only the Legislature could establish paid state
holidays.
   Mecham, a perennial political outsider who won a three-way race
against two establishment favorites to succeed Babbitt, rescinded
Babbitt's proclamation and was hit with a wave of entertainment and
convention boycotts.
   The protests mounted when Mecham defended use of the word
``pickaninny'' and made remarks that offended other ethnic groups.
   Mecham later proclaimed an unpaid King holiday, which remains in
effect but is scorned by supporters of the paid holiday. It came
too late. By April 1988 he was impeached and ousted.
   Mecham supporters took their revenge at the polls that fall,
ousting the Senate president, House speaker and several others who
had voted for impeachment. Symington beat Mecham in a GOP primary
comeback bid last September, but Mecham's chief lieutenant, running
as a write-in in the general election, cost him the majority
against Goddard.

<HEAD>Census on Schedule Despite Complaints from Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's top census taker said Tuesday the
1990 count is on schedule despite a sweeping recanvass ordered
after thousands of cities complained that some of their residents
had been skipped.
   ``Census operations are substantially on schedule and we do not
anticipate any delays,'' Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant
told a House panel.
   The final count will be delivered to President Bush by year's
end as required by law and he will have the privilege of announcing
the number that will be cited as America's population for much of
the decade.
   Bryant declined to give any preview of the number, saying that
was up to the president, and added that more information was needed
to make a judgment on the accuracy of the census.
   ``It is too early to conclude anything about the coverage
accuracy of the 1990 census,'' she said. She said a clearer picture
would emerge in the months ahead as the numbers are refined and
analyzed.
   The bureau is reviewing 5 million housing units in response to
complaints from cities and 15 million as part of its own
post-enumeration survey designed to check the accuracy of the
census. The resulting recanvass will affect 20 percent of the
nation's housing units.
   Bryant said the bureau is now wrapping up the final portions of
this survey in Philadelphia; Lansing, Mich., and Buffalo, N.Y.
   Documented challenges to the preliminary count have been
presented by 6,602, or 16.6 percent, of 39,189 local governments,
Bryant said. She said 2,262 gave favorable responses to their
surveys.
   Challenges, however, came from all of the 51 largest cities.
Twenty-two of them challenged fewer than 100 blocks, 34 fewer than
500 blocks. But counts of more than 2,000 blocks were challenged by
eight cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Honolulu, Los
Angeles, New York and Philadelphia.
   In the census a decade ago, 6,500 governments presented such
challenges but only 2,500 could provide documentation, she said.
``This time, 7,600 challenged and 6,600 provided documentation we
could check,'' she said.
   ``This does not mean that the 1990 census has poorer coverage,''
she said. She said the governments were better prepared and
motivated than in the past.
   ``We're taking everything they did very seriously,'' she told
reporters after the hearing. But she said that in some cases cities
were ``using just any kind of definition they could come up with.''
   She said both the Census Bureau and some cities had made
``geocoding'' errors involving the location of housing units. In
other cases, she said, mistakes were based on obsolete data.
   She said substantial inaccuracy rates were found in Chicago and
part of New Jersey and there was evidence that information had been
falsified. But she said the inaccuracies had little impact on the
count.
   In one case, she said, New York officials claimed that 414
housing units had been omitted in Queens. But the tract was located
within the Gateway National Seashore.
   ``All we could find were three lifeguard benches,'' she said.

   The nations of NATO and the Warsaw Pact
will officially declare an end to their military rivalry in a
special statement drawn up for signing next week, sources said
Wednesday.
   ``The two pacts are saying, `We're going to put the Cold War
behind us, and we're looking at ways to improve our relations,'''
said a Western diplomat, who demanded anonymity.
   ``We have a document that basically focuses on ending ... the
kind of conflict inherent if not real between these countries,''
said a NATO official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Last-minute details were still being worked on in Vienna to
polish the 2{-page non-aggression statement.
   But officials said it would be finished in time for signing on
Monday in Paris by the leaders of the 16 nations of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the remaining six of the crumbling
Warsaw Pact.
   The declaration, however, will be overshadowed by the completion
of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, a historic agreement
designed to slash tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear arms in
Europe.
   The arms accord also was expected to be signed on Monday,
shortly before the opening of a summit of the 34 nations of the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, or CSCE. The
gathering will bring together the leaders of the United States,
Canada and 32 European nations - all but Albania.
   The less dramatic, but also important, non-aggression statement
will end decades of hostility between the 41-year-old NATO and the
Warsaw Pact, which was set up by Moscow in 1955.
   The document, according to sources, was expected to say that a
``new era of European relations is beginning'' and that the nations
are ``no longer adversaries.''
   They will promise to work to together to ``build new
partnerships'' and ``extend the hand of friendship,'' according to
the sources. And, they will pledge to refrain from the threat or
use of force against each other.
   The statement will welcome new diplomatic contacts between the
Western alliance and the East European countries. Since August, the
Soviet Union and East European nations have tapped diplomats in
Belgium to be their liaison with NATO.
   Mention also will be made of arms reductions in Europe and
upcoming negotiations between the United States and the Soviet
Union to trim short-range nuclear weapons, also in Europe.
   The dozen European nations, which are attending the CSCE summit
in Paris but are not part of either military alliance, will be
invited to sign the agreement, officials said.
   At a July summit in London, President Bush and other leaders of
the NATO nations proposed drawing up a non-aggression pact between
the alliances.
   The Kremlin earlier in the year had raised the possibility of a
joint Warsaw Pact-NATO declaration.
   Western officials were initially skeptical of Soviet motives,
worrying that such a document would give life to the dying Eastern
alliance. Some East European countries were said to be reluctant to
do anything to preserve the pact.
   But Western diplomats also wanted to ease Soviet fears o
becoming isolated militarily as its once-staunch allies in the East
moved closer to the West.
   The resulting statement, according to the NATO official,
reflects ``the mix of those two things: The express Soviet desire,
which we knew had a hook in it, but at the same time a (Western)
interest in trying to do something for the Soviets.''
   ``So the formula we came up was the willingness to develop a
document that would basically end the Cold War and would be signed
by the countries of NATO and the Warsaw Pact - but as countries and
not as members of the pact,'' he said.
   No promises were made of further NATO-Warsaw Pact contacts.
``It's a declaration of the end of the bloc-to-bloc approach,''
said the NATO source.
   Countries still in the Warsaw Pact are the Soviet Union, Poland,
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. East Germany dropped
out when it merged with West Germany, which belongs to NATO.
   Hungary already has said it plans to pull out of the Warsaw
Pact's military arm next year. Western officials say alliance
support also is weak in Poland and Czechoslovakia.
   NATO members are: the United States, Canada, Britain, Belgium,
Iceland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Denmark,
Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Turkey.

<HEAD>Highlights of Medical Studies, Findings Reported Wednesday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Here is a brief look at some recent medical findings on both the
research and practical fronts, as announced Wednesday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Heart-Hostility</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Hostile teen-agers are likely to grow up to be adults who have
high cholesterol, according to a study that finds new links between
anger and heart trouble.
   For years, many experts assumed that hard-driving, impatient
people with classic Type A personalities were at high risk of heart
attacks. But many have grown skeptical of this theory, and some now
believe that the truly lethal personality trait is hostility and
anger.
   ``People with high hostility at age 19 tend to have high
cholesterol levels at 40,'' according to Dr. Redford B. Williams of
Duke University.
   Redford's study was among several presented at the annual
meeting of the American Heart Association to suggest that hostile
people are more prone to heart trouble - both because of the
effects of adrenaline and other hormones on their bodies and their
tendency to have unhealthy living habits.

<HEAD>Muscle Spasms</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Minute injections of a highly poisonous toxin have been found
effective and safe in treating a variety of involuntary muscle
spasms, a committee of experts announced at the National Institutes
of Health.
   The toxin, obtained from a bacteria that causes botulism food
poisoning, has been used successfully to treat spasms of the
eyelids, throat, face and the vocal cords, the panel said.
   ``This is the most powerful toxin known,'' said Dr. Roger
Duvoisin of the Robert Wood Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J.
   The complex protein, known formally as botulinum toxin, is
produced by a bacteria in spoiled food and can lead to lethal food
poisoning in large doses.
   Duvoisin said, however, that in very small injected doses the
toxin has the ability to block signals from nerves to muscles. This
action will halt involuntary muscle spasms.

<HEAD>Hyperactivity</HEAD>
<NOTE>For release at 6 p.m. EST, time set by source</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have discovered the first specific abnormality in the
brains of people with hyperactivity, the most common psychiatric
disorder of childhood, and believe it may an underlying cause of
the condition.
   Their study found that parts of the brain essential for
attention and controlling behavior do not work as hard as usual in
hyperactive people. Experts described this as a potentially
important insight into the sources of the mysterious ailment.
   People have long suspected that some physical irregularity is at
the heart of the disorder, which affects between 2 percent and 4
percent of school-age children.
   However, Dr. Alan J. Zametkin, who directed the research, said,
``This is the first large study of hyperactivity that shows some
sort of metabolic abnormality.''

<HEAD>Alcohol-Aspirin</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Taking a couple aspirins with a cocktail can get you drunker,
doctors warned.
   Aspirin blocks the action of a stomach enzyme that breaks down
alcohol before it reaches the bloodstream, researchers reported in
the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``It's important that people be warned not to mix those two -
not to take aspirin before they drink, or rather, not to drink
after they take aspirin,'' Dr. Charles S. Lieber, director of the
Alcohol Research Center at the Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical
Center in New York, said in a telephone interview Tuesday.

<HEAD>Smoking Heart</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Cigarettes increase smokers' pain tolerance and could therefore
block the chest pains that serve as a warning for heart disease,
researchers said.
   In studies with 20 male smokers, ages 19 to 44, the researchers
found that the tolerance to pain increased with each of three
cigarettes smoked.
   The study was presented at the annual meeting of the Amerian
Heart Association by Dr. Paula Miller of the University of North
Carolina School of Medicine, the principal author of the study.
   Smokers are known to have a higher prevalence of what is called
``silent ischemia,'' said Miller. Silent ischemia occurs when blood
flow to the heart is briefly interrupted because of the buildup of
fatty deposits and cholesterol in the arteries that nourish the
heart.
   In many people, ischemia produces the chest pain known as
angina, which is an indicator of heart disease. In silent ischemia,
however, there is no pain to call attention to the underlying heart
disease.

<HEAD>Heart Shock</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Almost two-thirds of the 300,000 Americans who drop dead
suddenly each year from cardiac arrest might be saved if automatic
shocking machines were made as common as fire extinguishers, heart
specialists say.
   Catastrophic disturbances in the heart's normal rhythm - what
doctors call sudden death - account for about half of all heart
disease fatalities.
   Shocking the heart with a machine called a defibrillator can
restore normal beating. But the shock must be delivered within five
minutes, or the victim will die or suffer brain damage.
   ``This is an immense problem,'' said Dr. Douglas P. Zipes of the
University of Indiana. ``In terms of numbers, it far outstrips
everything else, but it's a solvable problem.''

</TEXT>
<HEAD>Snoring-Heart Attack</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   About 2 million Americans unknowingly suffer from a breathing
disorder called obstructive sleep apnea that doubles their risk of
dying from a heart attack, researchers say.
   The disorder, in which people stop breathing for 30 to 60
seconds or longer during sleep, is most common in people who snore,
said Dr. Bernard Burack, a cardiologist at the Montefiore Medical
Center's Sleep-Wake Center in New York.
   ``That doesn't mean everyone who snores is going to drop dead,''
Burack said. But patients with the snoring-related disorder have a
risk of heart-related death 2.1 times the national average, Burack
reported at the annual scientific meeting of the American Heart
Association.
   It occurs most often in men, but when it occurs in women it is
even more lethal, Burack said.

<HEAD>Smoking-Offices</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   An anti-smoking group has blocked proposed national ventilation
standards that it said would not have protected office workers
against the toxic effects of second-hand cigarette smoke.
   A lawyer for the group charged in an appeal to the American
National Standards Institute that the proposed standards reflected
the aims of the tobacco industry, which had sought to soften the
ventilation requirements in buildings where smoking is allowed.
   ``The tobacco industry almost succeeded in pulling off a
tremendous coup,'' Richard Daynard, chairman of the Tobacco
Products Liability Project in Boston, said. ``They were using the
standards to cast doubt on the evidence that environmental tobacco
smoke causes disease.''
   In a letter that it has been sending to employers, the Tobacco
Institute has said ``Where ventilation is adequate and ventilation
systems are properly maintained, tobacco smoke is not a problem.''
It based that conclusion on the proposed ventilation standards. A
copy of the letter was obtained by The Associated Press.

   Pope John Paul II on Wednesday urged the
faithful in Eastern Europe to maintain hope in the face of
``multiple difficulties'' during the transition from dictatorship
to democracy.
   Speaking at his weekly general audience, the pontiff pointed to
the sweeping political changes that have occurred the past year in
his native Poland, Hungary, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania,
Bulgaria, the Soviet Union and parts of Yugoslavia.
   ``Let us remember the last months of last year as the beginning
of a great transformation,'' he said. ``The life of society and
political structures were tranformed. Nations are freeing
themselves from totalitarian chains to create new forms of
community life according to the rights of persons and human
society.''
   ``At the same time, everywhere we are witnesses of multiple
difficulties,'' he continued. ``How difficult it is to make the
truth of solidarity prevail in daily life. How difficult it is to
rebuild, in new conditions, the dimensions of the realcommon
good.''
   John Paul said he was praying that ``courage does not desert us
in difficulty, that we don't lose faith.''

<HEAD>Iraq Says United States Seeks to Control Oil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz on Wednesday
accused the United States of seeking to dominate the world oil
market.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted Aziz as saying, `The main
U.S. objective in the region is to control oil wells and dictate
oil policies.''
   He was responding to comments by U.S. Secretary of State James
A. Baker III a day earlier in Bermuda.
   In those remarks, Baker said U.S. officials are concerned that
the Persian Gulf crisis will increase unemployment in the United
States. He said Washington cannot permit Iraq to strangle ``the
economic lifeline from the gulf.''
   Baker's suggestion that Iraq might cut off oil supplies if it
kept control of Kuwait ``deliberately obscured'' the oil policies
that Baghdad has pursued the past 20 years, the foreign minister
said.
   ``These policies have ... tried to prevent market fluctuations,
whereas the regimes that have received U.S. troops were the parties
that tampered with the oil market to serve the ruler's whims and
their evil ambitions.''
   It was not clear who he was referring to. Saudi Arabia, where
most of the U.S. forces are stationed, has sought to prevent market
fluctations. Saudi Arabia controls about one-fourth of the world's
oil reserves, and Iraq, under control of Kuwait, accounts for about
20 percent of the world's oil reserves.
   Before invading Kuwait on Aug. 2, Iraq accused it and the United
Arab Emirates of trying to wreck Iraq's economy by pumping
excessive amounts of oil and bringing the price down.

   States must suspend the driver's licenses of
all convicted drug offenders or risk losing part of their federal
highway funds under newly approved legislation signed by President
Bush.
   The measure applies to all states and all illegal drugs,
including the 10 states where possession of small amounts of
marijuana has been decriminalized but is still considered an
infraction of the law.
   The legislation, included in the transportation appropriations
bill for the current fiscal year, got little attention during the
flurry of activity as Congress rushed to leave town at the end of
October.
   News that the measure had become law drew criticism from groups
as diverse as the National Governors Association and the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
   The legislation calls for withholding 5 percent of federal
highway funds starting Oct. 1, 1993 from states that fail to impose
six-month suspensions on drivers convicted of a drug offense. The
cut would increase to 10 percent on Oct. 1, 1995.
   About half the states now allow suspension of drug offenders'
licenses, but only New Jersey, Colorado, Georgia and Pennsylvania
have mandated such suspensions for drivers of all ages, according
to Liz Gibson of the American Legislative Exchange Council.
   Passed Oct. 27 and signed by Bush on Nov. 5, the measure
accomplishes in large part what national drug control policy
director William J. Bennett tried to impose more than a year ago.
But White House chief of staff John Sununu, a former governor of
New Hampshire, blocked that effort, arguing that states should be
allowed to decide such matters for themselves, administration
sources say.
   The new legislation notes that states can reject the rules and
still obtain federal funding if their legislatures vote
specifically against requiring the license suspensions and their
governors go on record in agreement with that position.
   ``This forces the states to be accountable,'' said an
administration source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We're
not going to force you, but if you don't want to do it, you'll have
to be public about it.''
   Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., who pushed the amendment, said
his main targets were New York and California, which have both
decriminalized marijuana. Both also have splits in party control:
In California, the Democrats control the legislature, the governor
is a Republican; in New York, the governor is a Democrat and his
party controls the state assembly while Republicans control the
state senate.
   ``Seventy-five percent of the drug purchases in America are done
by casual drug users, and that's white, upper-middle class
Americans that drive their Pontiac Firebirds into the ghetto and
buy these killer drugs,'' Solomon said.
   ``You don't see the murders take place out in the suburbs, but
it's the casual drug user who supplies the demand for these
drugs,'' he said. ``If you do away with the demand for drugs, then
the drugs will dry up in this country. ... When it starts to affect
their livelihoods, maybe then they'll stop using these drugs.''
   But license suspensions wouldn't necessarily affect their
livelihoods, because they would receive limited driving permits
enabling them to continue commuting to work, he said.
   In the current fiscal year, the Federal Highway Administration
will distribute some $12.3 billion to the states. Of that total,
California will get the largest chunk, some $1.1 billion. New York
is to get $666 million.
   Nolan Jones, staff director for the National Governors'
Association's justice and public safety committee, said his group
fought the measure last summer and still opposes it.
   ``Numerous states have driver's license revocation laws, but
they don't go as far as this calls for,'' Jones said. ``That points
to why we are against the whole issue of mandates when looking at
this sort of problem.''
   Criticism also came from Lester Lamm, president of the Highway
Users Federation for Safety and Mobility, which includes everything
from road builders to insurance companies and automobile clubs.
   ``In many cass, they're holding a program hostage for something
that the program managers have no say over,'' Lamm said. ``The
state departments of transportation don't have any role in the
criminalization of drug possession.''
   NORML, which has urged the legalization of marijuana for two
decades, also denounced the new legislation, saying, ``It seems
ludicrous that we would take our concerns with drugs and somehow
transform them to a completely different area, i.e. transportation
and money for roads.''

   A television journalist will become the first
Japanese citizen in space when he joins Soviet cosmonauts on a
mission Dec. 2, officials said.
   Toyekiro Akiyama of Japan's TBS television network appeared at a
news conference Monday with Soviet cosmonauts Victor Afanasyev and
Mussa Manapov at the Soviet space complex at Star City, the
government newspaper Izvestia said Tuesday.
   The December flight, details of which have not been announced,
will be the first for a Japanese citizen. Akiyama also will be the
first journalist to take part in a Soviet space flight.
   The newspaper did not say why Akiyama was chosen over several
Soviet candidates.
   Other foreigners, including those from France, Afghanistan and
Cuba, have flown on Soviet space flights.
   The Soviet Union has been trying to boost the image and
profitability of its space program following budget problems and a
series of mishaps.
   A hatch on the Soviet space station Mir failed during a flight
this year, and a rocket exploded on the launch pad last month,
destroying what a U.S. expert said was probably a spy satellite.
   Soviet officials also named a backup crew for the Dec. 2 flight,
including another Japanese journalist, Ryoko Kikuti.
   The Japanese journalists are training for the flight at Star
City and will visit to the Moscow area this month for a brief rest
before the liftoff, the newspaper reported.
   Asked at the news conference what part of the training they
found most difficult, both Japanese journalists said it was
learning Russian, Izvestia said.
   ``But they are confident that, with time, they will speak
well,'' the newspaper reported.

<HEAD>Body of Black Man Found at Toussaint Gravesite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists searching for the remains of
sainthood candidate Pierre Toussaint say they have found the body
of a black male, but are not sure it is Toussaint.
   ``This is the furthest we've gotten,'' Joseph Zwilling,
spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, said
Wednesday. He said three other bodies discovered in the old
graveyard in lower Manhattan where Toussaint was buried were either
white or female or both.
   Toussaint, who was born a slave in Haiti and came to New York
with his French owners, could become the first black American saint
if his candidacy is approved by the Vatican. He died a free man in
1853 after what church officials say was a life of exemplary
charity and virtue.
   Zwilling said archaeologists and forensic anthropologists
searching for Toussaint's remains would have to exhume the body and
study the skull, teeth and other parts before deciding if it
belonged to Toussaint.
   In 1989 the church began investigating and examining Toussaint's
life, the first formal step if he is to be canonized. The process
can take years.
   Identifying Toussaint's remains is part of that process. If he
is made a saint, his bones may be distributed to churches and
places where he once lived.

   Thousands of riot troops stormed a barricaded
neighborhood with bulldozers and armored trucks Wednesday and
smashed a defiant community of anarchists in the heart of Berlin.
   Commuters watched as officers burst through the makeshift
barriers after daybreak and battled for hours before driving
hundreds of radicals from a row of tenements in the former East
Berlin.
   At least 325 people were arrested and 70 officers and protesters
were injured, including one squatter shot in the foot when a police
officer's warning shot ricocheted, police said.
   One officer and 15 squatters had to be hospitalized, they said.
   About 50,000 people marched through eastern Berlin late
Wednesday to denounce the police raid and to demand affordable
housing.
   Many residents of eastern Berlin now get rent subsidies, a
practice that will soon end.
   The protesters tried to march to the street where the squatters
lived, but a huge police presence turned them back. No serious
violence resulted, although protesters tore down or burned campaign
posters that major political parties have put up for the Dec. 2
national elections.
   Wednesday's confrontation was the third in three days on Mainzer
Street and the latest example of lawlessness in the former East
Germany, once strictly controlled by Communist rulers.
   As many as 3,000 police, many of them paramilitary units brought
in from other German states, moved in to seize the heavily
fortified Mainzer Street and adjoining streets where leftist
radicals had taken up positions.
   Armored personnel carriers and bulldozers burst through several
barricades and officers used clubs, water cannons and tear gas in
pitched battles with the radicals.
   Radicals fired flare guns and threw rocks and firebombs from
rooftops and windows. The battle spilled onto several other streets
and an adjoining six-lane thoroughfare was closed to traffic.
   ``And now, our street is kaput,'' said Waetroud Goets, 59, after
the fighting spread to the block where she lived for 30 years. ``I
never had any trouble with these people, but as soon as the police
showed up they started throwing rocks.''
   After the fighting, Mainzer Street was filled with smoldering
debris - spent tear-gas canisters, junked cars and furniture that
had been hurled from windows. Much of the street was torn up by the
radicals, who used its cobblestones as weapons.
   Berlin Interior Minister Erich Paetzold said the clash was
marked by ``unbelievable brutality'' from the radicals.
   Baerbel Bohley, an activist who helped lead the peaceful revolt
that toppled communism last year, denounced the police raid as an
unnecessary use of force. She said a peaceful solution could have
been reached.
   Most of the radicals involved in the fighting are anarchists
from the former West Berlin. Hundreds of radicals have taken over
abandoned row houses in eastern Berlin and have built encampments
on vacant land where the Berlin Wall once stood.
   The largest such community was on Mainzer Street, where 12
tenements were occupied and radicals set up special houses and
cafes for women and homosexuals. Signs and slogans, such as ``Eat
the Rich,'' and ``Learn to Burn,'' covered the tenements decorated
with the red-and-black flags of the anarchist movement.
   Authorities evicted radical leftists from three houses in other
parts of the city early Monday. Radicals on Mainzer Street began
building barricades, and hurled rocks when police showed up Monday
afternoon.
   That clash lasted until Tuesday morning, and at least 137
officers were hurt and 20 people were arrested.
   Experts say eastern Germany's freedom from authoritarian rule
and its dire economic problems - including a high unemployment rate
and a lack of affordable housing - have created a breeding ground
for unrest.
   The crime has included rampages by hooligans after soccer games,
attacks on foreigners and homosexuals by neo-Nazis and increases in
prostitution, drugs and gambling.

<HEAD>Former Duke University Student Convicted Of Impersonating Baron</HEAD>

   A former Duke University student was
convicted Wednesday of defrauding two banks while masquerading as a
wealthy French baron.
   A jury convicted Maur Rothschild of four federal fraud charges
involving lines of credit and credit-card applications in 1987 and
1989.
   Prosecutors called him a veteran impostor.
   ``Mr. Rothschild knew exactly what he was doing and why he was
doing it,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney John Stone said during his
closing statement earlier in the day. ``Mr. Rothschild was nothing
more than a con man.''
   Rothschild, 38, faces up to eight years in prison and a $1
million fine. His sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 30.
   Rothschild showed little emotion when the verdict was read. He
would not comment when he was led from the courtroom.
   The government has refused to say how much money Rothschild
defrauded from Duke Federal Credit Union and Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust
Co. in September and December 1987 and April 1989, but it was
believed to be thousands of dollars.
   Born in El Paso, Texas, as Mauro Cortez Jr., Rothschild signed
two applications for lines of credit as Baron Maurice de
Rothschild. On one he listed his mother as ``Baroness Maurie de
Rothschild.'' In federal court documents, his name is listed as
Maur Jeffrey Loche Rothschild.
   Rothschild said he meant to change his first name to Maurice but
that a clerk made an error, changing it instead to Maur.
   He said he had been abused as a child and had undergone
extensive therapy and ``basically it got to a point where I lived
out my fantasies.'' He once tried to kill himself, Rothschild said.
   After the name change, he said he began to believe that he was a
member of the French Rothschild family while he was a continuing
education student at Duke in 1987.
   ``We're all disappointed with the verdict,'' said his lawyer,
Matthew Martin. ``It's obvious Maurice signed these forms. Of
course, the question is, `What was behind the signature?' Maurice
is not the run-of-the-mill, ordinary person. He lives his life in a
different way.''
   Rothschild testified that the two banks pressured him into
taking loans and never verified who he was.
   Martin said no one would deny Rothschild had problems. But he
said: ``Don't you know the folks at these institutions began to
salivate when they heard a member of the internationally known
family of Rothschild had come to Durham. The banks were involved in
his fantasy as well.
   Martin said the banks used a double-standard with Rothschild,
taking his word on information because they didn't want to press a
wealthy customer about detail.
   Stone said Rothschild was a ``veteran impostor'' who finally got
caught at his game.
   Rothschild also faces state charges of fraudulently obtaining
$1,200 from a private cancer fund in Durham between May and June
last year.

   Botulinum toxin, best-known as a cause of
lethal food poisoning, has been found to be safe and effective in
small injections for a variety of muscle spasms, a National
Institutes of Health committee announced Wednesday.
   The toxin, obtained from bacteria that cause botulism food
poisoning, has been used successfully to treat involuntary
clinching of muscles in the eyelids, throat, face and the vocal
cords, the panel said.
   It also shows promise in the treatment of stuttering,
misalignment of the eyes and for cramps experienced by musicians,
writers and typists.
   Dr. Roger Duvoisin, chairman of the NIH panel and on the faculty
of the Robert Wood Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J., said the
toxin is an example of a highly lethal poison that can be
beneficial used in small doses.
   ``This is the most powerful toxin known,'' said Duvoisin. And,
yet, he noted ``it has given relief where little was available
before.''
   He said there are hundreds of thousands of Americans who suffer
from some form of muscle spasm that can be treated by the toxin.
   Known formally as botulinum toxin, the substance is a complex
protein produced by bacteria that in contaminated food can lead to
lethal poisoning.
   But very small doses injected directly into specific muscles,
Duvoisin said, have the ability to block signals from nerves to
muscles. This action will halt involuntary muscle spasms.
   ``Muscle spasms can be quiet disabling maladies,'' said
Duvoisin.
   Spasms can distort facial expressions, or cause eyelids to close
tightly so that victims have to pry them open by hand, or cause the
voice to jam when the vocal cords are involved. Unbalanced muscles
can cause eyes to be crossed or pointed fixedly to the side.
   Duvoisin said that a form of muscle spasm cut short the piano
career of Robert Schuman and led to a cramping disorder now
described as the Schuman hand. Writers and typist have similar
problems.
   The NIH panel, which evaluated the use of the toxin, said all of
these conditions may be helped by small injections of the poison.
   Mrs. Robert Bruce, the president of the Benign Essential
Blepharospasm Research Foundation and a member of the panel, said
that the toxin shots were able to restore her to a full life.
   Her problem started, she said, when muscles controlling both
eyelids suddenly contracted and refused to open.
   Mrs. Bruce said she was unable to see unless she pried her
eyelids open by hand. When the lids were released, they jammed
closed once more.
   ``I couldn't work, I couldn't drive, I couldn't cook,'' said
Mrs. Bruce. ``I couldn't even go shopping. Someone had to lead me
around by the hand.''
   She tried a number of treatments - including hypnotism,
biofeedback and 12 types of medications - but nothing worked.
   Then a doctor injected specific muscles in her face with small
doses of the botulinum toxin.
   The effect was to loosen and weaken the malfunctioning muscles
and Mrs. Bruce said it enables her to control her eyelids normally.
   Duvoisin said the toxin injections work for only a few months
and then the effect wears off. He said there is no apparent limit
on the number new injection rounds that can be used without side
effects.
   The therapy takes a high degree of expertise and only a limited
number of experts are skilled in its use, he said. More are being
trained now.
   A round of treatment with the toxin can cost from $400 to
$1,800, Duvoisin said.

   The Persian gulf crisis was the news story
most closely followed by the American public last month, although
interest in economic conditions jumped markedly, according to a
poll released Wednesday.
   Nearly two-thirds of a nationwide sample of adults questioned in
a Times-Mirror poll said they were very closely following the Iraqi
occupation of Kuwait and the presence of U.S. military forces in
Saudi Arabia. It was the fourth consecutive month the gulf
situation has been the top story.
   Interest in the plight of U.S. hostages in Iraq and Kuwait was
also high, with 49 percent saying they were following the story
closely.
   Interest in the economy rose to its highest point for the year,
39 percent. That was 10 points higher than in September and only
one point below the level of public interest the Times-Mirror poll
found in the October 1987 stock market crash.
   And 38 percent of those polled said they followed news about
elections and campaigns in their states - about on a par with this
year's turnout level, estimated at 36 percent. A month earlier,
only 18 percent reported paying close attention to election news.
   The budget negotiations on Capitol Hill intensified and
concluded in October, but the level of public interest stayed the
same as October - 34 percent. Only 46 percent of those questioned
knew that Congress hmminent. An armed
conflict would threaten world oil supplies and drive up prices.
   Crude oil prices gained $1.25 Tuesday on strong war words by
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. But market fundamentals
such as supplies and other technical factors played a larger role
Wednesday.
   ``As weeks go by and people are more comfortable with the
situation - to the extent that they feel war is not immediately
around the corner - those become more important in decision
making,'' Gohler said.
   ``From a fundamental point of view, the market is certainly
relatively weak if you look at the numbers,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, President Bush clashed with leaders of Congress
trying to limit his war-making powers but assured lawmakers he has
not decided to use military force to push Iraqi troops out of
occupied Kuwait.
   Gohler said API statistics showing home heating oil supplies 13
million barrels higher than a year earlier pushed down prices in
that market.
   December-delivery contracts for wholesale home heating oil
traded on the Merc fell 1.63 cents a gallon to 86.64 cents after
rising 1.75 cents Tuesday. Later-month contracts also fell.
   Unleaded gasoline tumbled 2.72 cents a gallon to 80.39 cents,
with later months also lower. Natural gas rose .17 cent per 1,000
cubic feet at $2.428 after rising .1 cent Tuesday. Later-month
contracts were mixed.

<HEAD>Three British Detectives Face Charges in IRA Bombing Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three detectives who investigated two IRA bombings
in 1974 will be charged with falsifying evidence to alter justice,
the Crown Prosecution Service said Wednesday.
   Four people convicted in the case spent 15 years in prison
before an appeals court freed them last year. The court threw out
the convictions after prosecutors admitted police tampered with
some evidence.
   The officers were from the Surrey police force in southern
England. The prosecutions follow a nine-month inquiry ordered by
Home Secretary David Waddington.
   The Director of Public Prosecutions decided that former
Detective Chief Inspector Thomas Style, former Detective Sgt. John
Donaldson and Detective Constable Vernon Attwell will be prosecuted
following the investigation into the Guildford and Woolwich pub
bombings in 1974, the announcement said.
   It said the prosecution service found no evidence to justify
charges against others, though two other Surrey officers face
departmental disciplinary proceedings.
   Patrick Armstrong, Paul Hill and Gerard Conlon, all of Belfast,
Northern Ireland, and Carole Richardson, an English woman, were
convicted of murdering five people in Guildford Oc. 5, 1974.
   The prosecution case was based solely on confessions that the
four repudiated in court. The convictions were upheld even after
four members of an Irish Republican Army gang confessed to carrying
out the Guildford bombing.
   Armstrong and Hill also were convicted of a pub bombing in the
London suburb of Woolwich on Nov. 6, 1974 in which two people died
and 26 people were injured - and which the IRA gang also claimed.
   Chief Constable Brian Hayes said he took comfort that only three
officers from his force were being charged. He expressed relief
``that no evidence has emerged of any systematic conspiracy,
corruption or wrongdoing in respect of the Guildford pub bombings
case.''
   Summonses were expected to be served on the three within the
next week.

   Rapper L.L. Cool J crooned against cigarettes
Wednesday with actress Carol Channing and other celebrities who
urged people to stamp out their butts for the Great American
Smokeout.
   An eclectic mix of two dozen personalities from television,
stage, sports, music and politics gathered on the eve of the 14th
annual Smokeout to give firsthand accounts of what made them give
up tobacco, or never start.
   The venue was the American Cancer Society offices. The society
sponsors the yearly pitch to get at least some of the country's 50
million smokers to abandon their unhealthy habit for 24 hours, if
not longer.
   ``Throw your cigarettes away for the day. ... The clouds of
smoke will turn so sunny, not to mention savin' you money,'' the
celebrities sang.
   Lung surgeon Dr. Bill Cahan told the crowd to remember people
like Sammy Davis Jr., Yul Brenner and Leonard Bernstein. All died
as a direct result of smoking, he said.
   ``I see the end result of smoking all too often. As a matter of
fact, I've named my surgery room `Marlboro Country,''' Cahan said.
   In Philadelphia, a familiar stogie was stubbed out. Advertising
for the automotive Pep Boys will no longer include a cigar-chomping
Manny. Since the Roaring Twenties, a beaming, bespectacled likeness
of the late Emanuel ``Manny'' Rosenfeld accompanied the other two
Pep Boys - Moe &amp; Jack - in ads for the auto parts and service chain
that operates in 17 states.
   The celebrities in New York stepped up to tell their smoking
stories.
   ``When I was 30 and doing eight shows a day, I smoked three
packs a day,'' the effervescent actress Carol Channing said. ``I
couldn't get into a bathtub without an ashtray, a match and a
cigarette.''
   A stern warning from her doctor got her thinking about quitting.
But it was Cupid who deserves the credit, she said.
   ``At the same time, I met my future husband and he didn't smoke.
... I didn't want to smell like an old sewer around somebody I was
stuck on.''
   Rod Gilbert, a National Hockey League hall of famer, said he was
12 when he stole a pack of cigarettes from his older brother.
   When his brother found out, Gilbert said: ``He took me upstairs
to the bathroom and hit me on the head with his fist ... and then
said, `Get up, I'm going to hit you again.'''
   The bop on the bean and a stern lecture convinced him to leave
the butts alone - for a while.
   After retiring from hockey, Gilbert said he got into the
restaurant business and began smoking. He quit two years ago after
having some polyps removed.
   Rapper L.L. Cool J never was and never will be a smoker.
   ``Smoking is the pits. It's terrible. It's garbage. I hate it.
Get rid of them,'' he said.
   The Philadelphia-based Pep Boys agree.
   Rosenfeld smoked cigars until his death, but his image puffed on
for the chain, which has 300 stores and employs 12,000 people.
   To coincide with the Smokeout, the cigar got tossed.
   ``The decision was based on our desire to promote a healthier
image for employees and customers,'' said Fred Stampone, senior
vice president of the company founded in 1921.

   Stephen Sondheim's ``Into the Woods'' was named
the best musical of the 1989-90 London theater season at the annual
Evening Standard Drama Awards.
   ``Shadowlands,'' a play by William Nicholson based on the life
of writer C.S. Lewis, won the best drama award. It opened on
Broadway two days earlier to mixed-to-negative reviews. Its London
run finished in September and its future in New York is in doubt.
   The best actress award went to Josette Simon. The British
actress won praise in June for being the first black woman to play
the Marilyn Monroe part, Maggie, in Arthur Miller's partly
autobiographical play, ``After the Fall.''
   Richard Harris was named best actor for his performance in the
title role of Luigi Pirandello's ``Henry IV.'' The revival, which
was not a commercial success, has been mentioned for Broadway next
year.

   Rain was scattered across the Northwest on Wednesday, with snow
at higher elevations, and temperatures rose nearly 20 degrees above
normal in the upper Midwest and Plains, breaking records that were
nearly a century old.
   Afternoon rain extended from San Francisco across north-central
California. Showers were scattered over northwestern Washington
state, with thundershowers at Hoquiam Pass.
   Rain over west-central Montana and the Idaho Panhandle changed
to snow over northwestern Idaho.
   About 3 inches of snow fell overnight on Siskiyou Summit, near
the California-Oregon state line, and 5 inches of new snow covered
Washington's Stampede Pass at sunrise.
   By noon, temperatures over much of the upper Midwest reached as
much as 20 degrees above normal for mid-November. The dividing line
between warm temperatures and much cooler temperatures extended
across north-central North Dakota, northwestern Wyoming and on to
the central coast of California, the National Weather Service said.
   Record highs included 74 degrees at Concordia, Kan.; 77 at
Denver; 73, a tie at Des Moines; 67 at Eau Claire, Wis.; 75, a tie
at Goodland, Kan.; 73, a tie at Kansas City, Mo.; 68, a tie at La

Minn.; 67 at St. Cloud, Minn.; and 78, a tie at Valentine, Neb.
   The previous records at Denver, North Platte, Pueblo and
Valentine had stood since 1894.
   The normal high temperature for Nov. 14 at Minneapolis-St. Paul
is 43.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 30

<HEAD>Study Says Hispanics Lost Ground In 1980s</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hispanic earnings and living conditions
deteriorated in many metropolitan areas and Hispanics lost economic
ground compared to other Americans during the 1980s, according to a
study issued Wednesday.
   The independent, non-profit Aspen Institute said overall
conditions for Hispanics improved in only one city, Miami, and
remained relatively stable in only one other city with a large
Hispanic population, San Diego.
   But the ``parity gap'' with Anglo-Americans widened in 11 other
cities over the past decade, the report said. The 13 cities studied
are home to two-thirds of U.S. Hispanics.
   ``While the rich got richer and the poor got poorer, did
Hispanics get poorer than Anglos? They did,'' the report said.
   Between 1979 and 1987, the real median family income of
Hispanics fell in all but four of the 13 areas - New York; McAllen,
Texas; Miami; and Phoenix, where it remain unchanged.
   With the exception of McAllen, aided by a joint venture with
Mexico, the greatest declines occurred among Hispanics in Texas,
where the economy was hit by the oil price shocks of the 1980s, the
study found.
   In Dallas, Hispanics' median family income fell from $23,274 in
1979 to $19,000 in 1987, while the percentage of Hispanics living
in poverty grew from 20 percent to 30 percent over the past decade.
   In Houston, Hispanics' family income fell from $25,281 in 1979
to $19,000 in 1987. At the beginning of the 1980s, 19 percent of
Hispanics were living in poverty, at the close of the decade, 30
percent were considered below the poverty level.
   In addition to studying income and poverty rates, the report
looked at educational attainment, unemployment rates and other
factors to judge overall Hispanic-Anglo-American parity. It said
San Diego had the narrowest parity gap, followed, in order, by
Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver, Dallas, Houston, Chicago
and New York. Comparable data was not available for McAllen, El
Paso, San Antonio and Phoenix.
   Miami has made the greatest progress toward parity, the study
said, followed by San Diego, Dallas, Chicago, New York, Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Houston and Denver.
   The report warned that the growing gap between Hispanics and
Anglo-Americans must be closed.
   ``The nation's competitive position cannot be maintained if a
sharp division continues between stable leadership isolated in the
suburbs and poor workers and an underclass isolated in
deteriorating inner cities,'' said Solomon D. Trujillo, vice
president and general manager of US WEST Communications.
   Trujillo is also chairman of the Aspen Institute's Hispanic
Americans and the Business Community Program, which issued the
report.
   The country's Hispanic population is estimated to be 34.8
million in the year 2000, up from 20.1 million in 1989.

   An environmental group and a dozen of the
country's major zoos hope to enlist schoolchildren in the fight to
curb the commercial exploitation of endangered wild animals.
   The World Wildlife Fund unveiled a program Wednesday in which
suitcases full of confiscated wildlife products - including
elephant tusks and cat skins - will be used in an education program
aimed at youngsters.
   The education kit ``will provide a hands-on way to show young
people that what they buy does make a difference in saving
endangered species,'' said Kathryn Fuller, president of the World
Wildlife Fund and the Conservation Foundation.
   ``Suitcases for Survival'' are being sent to a dozen zoos around
the country where they will be made available for teachers to use
in classrooms.
   Most of the items were confiscated at U.S. ports because they
violated the endangered species or other wildlife protection laws.
   The trade of wildlife products is estimated to be a $5 billion a
year industry worldwide. Officials of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service estimate that only about 10 percent of the illegal products

   An array of wildlife products confiscated by authorities were
displayed at a news conference at the National Zoo. They included a
leg rest made from an elephant foot, jewelry from elephant tusks,
stuffed endangered sea turtles, skins from a variety of endangered
cats as well products made from crocodile, snake and lizard skins
and a knife handle made from a rhinoceros tusk.

<HEAD>Rundown of History at Eastern Airlines</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Eastern, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are key events in the history of Eastern Airlines over the
past 15 years:
   1975 - Frank Borman, former astronaut, becomes president.
   1976 - Borman becomes chairman and wins pay freeze from workers.
   1978 - Congress deregulates airline industry, allowing carriers
to set their own fares and fly where they want. As fare wars begin,
Borman plunges Eastern deep into debt by buying a fleet of new
planes.
   1980 - Eastern's debt swells to more than $2.2 billion.
   1983 - Borman threatens to take Eastern into bankruptcy without
concessions from employees to reduce costs. They relent in exchange
for a 25 percent stake in the company and seats on the board.
   1985 - Labor tension increases despite union participation in
running the company. Eastern barely breaks even due to fare wars.
   1986 - Eastern's debt increases to $2.5 billion. Company again
considers bankruptcy, lays off more than 1,000 workers and gets
wage concessions from pilots. But debt pressure forces the sale of
the airline to Texas Air Corp. for $676 million. Borman quits.
   1987 - Texas Air boss Frank Lorenzo, considered a union-buster
by organized labor, vows to cut costs at Eastern.
   March 1989 - Lorenzo rejects union demands, workers strike and
Eastern seeks protection from creditors in bankruptcy court.
Lorenzo replaces strikers and sells some Eastern assets, notably
the Northeast shuttle to developer Donald Trump.
   April 1989 - An attempt to buy Eastern led by former baseball
commissioner Peter Ueberroth collapses. Eastern vows to reorganize
into a smaller airline.
   September 1989 - Lorenzo predicts Eastern will turn a profit in
1990.
   November 1989 - Striking pilots and flight attendants vote to
return to work, leaving machinists alone on picket lines.
   December 1989 - American Airlines agrees to buy Eastern's Latin
American routes for $471 million, shrinking Eastern by about
one-third.
   January 1990 - Eastern backs away from earlier pledge to fully
repay all its debts.
   March 1990 - Special examiner in bankruptcy case finds Texas Air
victimized Eastern by purchasing some key assets at unfairly low
prices. Texas Air disputes the report but agrees to give Eastern
$280 million in compensation.
   April 1990 - Angry creditors, frustrated by Eastern's rising
losses and reduced plan for repayment, seek appointment of a
special trustee to run the airline and possibly find a buyer.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland grants their request, seizing
control from Lorenzo and appoints veteran airline executive Martin
R. Shugrue Jr. to run the airline.
   May 1990 - Shugrue launches a ``100 Days'' promotional campaign,
vowing to make Eastern profitable and woo back passengers. He
follows in September with a plan for targeting business travelers.
   November 1990 - Shugrue's estimates for recovery prove grossly
optimistic, partly because of an economic downturn and rapidly
rising fuel costs caused by the Persian Gulf crisis. Exasperated
creditors decide to seek liquidation of the airline.

   Many British prime ministers serve long and
glorious terms in office, but for some the end has been sudden and
sorrowful.
   Few go out voluntarily in the style of Lord Salisbury, who
retired in 1902 after 13{ years in office.
   And since then, no one has served longer than Margaret Thatcher,
who faces her first serious challenge after 11{ years in power.
   She has lasted longer than Sir Winston Churchill and Herbert
Asquith, who each served eight years, eight months. Both resigned
under pressure from colleagues.
   Churchill lost the first peacetime election in 1945, but when a
Labor Party government fell in 1951, Churchill was back at 10
Downing Street, the prime minister's home.
   ``Everyone has his day, and some days last longer than others,''
he said in a speech to the House of Commons in 1952.
   Churchill's days of power lasted until 1955 when, at age 80, he
resigned under pressure from party colleagues who saw he could no
longer concentrate on Cabinet business.
   His successor, Sir Anthony Eden, lasted only two years, his
health and then his career broken by the Suez crisis.
   Churchill lived a decade after retiring, but others died soon
after relinquishing power.
   The Liberal Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was dead 17 days after
resigning in 1908. The Conservative Bonar Law lived only five
months after he quit in 1923.
   Neville Chamberlain, who was replaced by Churchill in the early
months of World War II, lived only another six months.
   Asquith was maneuvered out in 1916, in the midst of a world war,
by Liberal Party colleagues headed by David Lloyd George who
believed they could conduct the war more effectively.
   Lloyd George, still regarded as perhaps the cleverest prime
minister of the century, lost the 1922 election to Bonar Law's
Conservatives but expected to return to power quickly.
   The defeat, however, was the end of Lloyd George as a force in
politics and also of his Liberal Party. He remained in politics
until his death in 1945 but had little influence and no power.
   Harold Macmillan resigned after nearly seven years as prime
minister, after falling ill in 1963.
   He summoned Queen Elizabeth II to his hospital bedside and said
his foreign secretary, the 14th Earl of Home, later Lord Home of
the Hirsel, should succeed him and not R.A. Butler, Macmillan's
deputy, whom the prime minister disliked.
   But Macmillan could have stayed on - he did not die until 1986
at age 92. In any event, Home lasted only a year before the party
was defeated by Labor in a general election.
   During his term, however, Home changed the rules for selecting
Conservative prime ministers - abolishing the smoke-filled room of
party leaders in favor of a secret ballot by Tory lawmakers.

<HEAD>Gunman Kills 11 Before Dying in Shootout With Police</HEAD>

   Police on Wednesday fatally wounded
a man described as ``absolutely ruthless'' who set fire to a
neighbor's home in a coastal village and then shot to death 11
people who rushed to the scene.
   Two young girls wounded in the assault were hospitalized in
stable condition. A police officer was also shot in the leg.
   Police identified the killer, who used high-powered rifles, as
David Malcolm Gray, 33. Neighbors described him as a loner upset by
his mother's recent death.
   New Zealand's worst massacre began Tuesday night when Gray set
fire to a the house in the South Island village of Aramoana. He
then began shooting people who came to help.
   ``There may have been a children's party on there or something
as there seemed to be a lot of kids about,'' said neighbor Dorothy
Crimp.
   The siege in the town 17 miles north of Dunedin ended 23 hours
later when anti-terrorism police rushed a house where Gray was
holed up and shot him in the chest.
   In between, Gray killed two children, including a 6-year-old boy
who rode up on his bicycle to see what all the commotion was about;
the head of police in nearby Port Chalmers; and eight other adults.
   While inside his home, Gray used high-powered rifles to keep
olice at bay and prevent them from reaching the victims, who were
scattered on the lawn and a nearby street.
   New Zealand Police Commissioner John Jamieson described the
gunman as ``one tough customer'' and ``absolutely ruthless.''
   ``We have a situation here obviously with a lunatic who's gone
berserk,'' Jamieson said. ``There are young children getting shot
down in cold blood.''
   About 140 police poured into remote Aramoana. The town comprises
just five streets and is home to about 25 people, mainly retirees.
   Officers steadily tightened a cordon around Gray's house before
rushing in Wednesday afternoon. Armed men in uniform and black ski
masks moved in, single file, as they hit the house with tear gas.
   Smoke spilled out the windows, but Gray was nowhere to be found
- just a .22-caliber rifle, an air rifle, 9mm ammunition - and
bodies.
   Police went door-to-door before moving back into the center of
town.
   The search led to a house on the edge of town. Jamieson said the
gunman opened fire on an anti-terrorism squad approaching the
building, wounding one officer in the leg.
   Police lobbed smoke grenades and returned fire, hitting Gray in
the chest. He died at the scene a few minutes later, Jamieson said.
   Dunedin police Sgt. Bill O'Brien said police were mystified over
what drove Gray to the violence. ``We don't know why he has done
this,'' O'Brien said.
   Neighbors described the unemployed Gray as a moody loner who had
been upset by the death of his mother about three months ago.
   Mrs. Crimp called him ``a very quiet chap, a real loner. ... He
never spoke to anyone.''
   Frank and Iris Henderson, who live in nearby Waipuna Bay, said
6-year-old victim Leo Wilson lived in the house opposite them.
   ``He heard all the police cars and fire engines going past and
went down on his bike to have a look at it all. He ran straight
into it,'' Henderson said.
   The worst previous massacre in New Zealand occurred in 1941 when
Eric Stanley Graham killed six police officers before he was shot
to death.

   The head of the nation's largest testing
organization said Wednesday a proposed exam to judge students and
their schools would be unnecessary, unwarranted and wasteful.
   Gregory Anrig, president of Educational Testing Service, said at
the National Press Club on Wednesday that he detailed his
opposition to such a test in a letter to the president's Education
Policy Advisory Committee.
   The panel reportedly is preparing to recommend national testing
of all students in grades four, eight and 12, and want to use the
results ``for important judgments about students and schools,'' he
said.
   ``What is needed is not another test, but strategies to promote
higher standards, clearer expectations for schools to achieve these
standards, and demonstrations that these standards and expectations
can be met successfully,'' Anrig said in the Sept. 19 letter.
   Deputy Education Secretary Ted Sanders agreed.
   ``We need to make better use of the instruments we have, both to
guide classroom learning and to measure our progress in meeting
national goals,'' he said.
   Anrig's comments underscored results of a Gallup Poll of the
nation's top teachers released earlier Wednesday.
   Seventy-three percent of the teachers surveyed said they felt
pressured to spend more time preparing students for tests, and 57
percent said classroom subjects were determined by what is covered
on the test.
   ``Exceptional teachers, who perhaps understand and deplore this
dilemma more than their peers, want to break the shackles that bind
them to wasteful modes of instruction,'' the poll said in its
summary.
   The Gallup Poll involved 231 teachers who were semifinalists
cited for excellence from among 20,000 nominees to a nationwide
program called ``Thanks to Teachers.''
   Anrig said 47 states already have statewide testing programs,
with results released annually. Congress also recently authorized
trial state assessments using the federally funded National
Assessment of Educational Progress.
   Anrig said the ETS next month will unveil instructional
assessments for critical thinking, science, mathematics, writing
and the arts at the junior high level. Rather than dictate
curriculum, the assessment will assist and supplement instruction,
he said.

   A monumental work by contemporary German-born
artist Anselm Kiefer titled ``Zim Zum'' has been given to the
National Gallery of Art by a private committee of wealthy
contributors, gallery director J. Carter Brown said Wednesday.
   ``Zim Zum,'' which measures nearly 18{ feet by 14{ feet, is the
first Kiefer work to enter the gallery collection. Completed
earlier this year, it will be put on public display Thursday in the
gallery's East Building.
   The Kiefer work is made of several interlocking sheets of lead
partially covered with canvas treated with oil, crayon, ashes, sand
and lead and clay dust, with a canvas landscape painting across the
bottom.
   Kiefer's complex works include references to Teutonic mythology
and historical drama. The title ``Zim Zum'' refers to the Judaic
concept of Tsimtsum, the instant of creation described in the
Kabbalah, a mystical Jewish system of occult beliefs and scriptural
interpretation.

   Georgia's new parliament declared Wednesday it
will seek full independence from the Soviet Union, which it accused
of seven decades of ``bloody terror and repression.''
   In Lithuania, Prime Minister Kazimiere Prunskiene said her
Baltic republic may soon face a second Kremlin economic blockade.
She sought help in advance from other Soviet republics, Western
companies and former U.S. Sen. Gary Hart.
   Angry members of the national legislature demanded that
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev report to them on his attempts to
hold the country together and on his Sunday meeting with his main
political rival, Russian Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin.
   Gorbachev agreed to address the Supreme Soviet on Friday, the
official Tass news agency said.
   Georgian lawmakers met in Tbilisi, their capital, for the first
time since a pro-independence coalition, the Round Table for a Free
Georgia, won Oct. 28 parliamentary elections. Those elections were
the first true multiparty polling in Soviet history.
   Parliament voted 238 to 5 with one abstention to elect Round
Table leader Zviad Gamsakhurdia, a 51-year-old author, as Georgia's
president. He immediately reiterated his promise to lead the
southern republic's 5.3 million people to complete independence and
a market-based economy.
   ``We are for an economy totally independent of the central
authorities, a maximum of privatization, and business contacts with
all (other states) on a mutually beneficial basis,'' he told
Interfax, an independent Soviet news agency.
   Tass said the parliament declared Georgia was entering a
transition period to ``full state independence'' and dropped
``Soviet'' and ``Socialist'' from its name. It now is called the
Republic of Georgia, instead of the Georgian Soviet Socialist
Republic. The length of the transition period was not set.
   Georgia earlier declared economic sovereignty from the central
Soviet government, but Wednesday's declaration went further and
appeared to rule out signing a new treaty of confederation among
the 15 Soviet republics, as Gorbachev wants.
   All 15 republics with the exception of Kirgizia now have taken
steps toward sovereignty or independence, and the parliament of
that Central Asian republic has been debating a possible
sovereignty resolution for weeks.
   Georgia's parliament restored the state hymn, seal and flag used
from 1919 to 1921, when Georgia was independent.
   In an amended preamble to the republic's constitution, the
lawmakers said that in February and March of 1921, ``Soviet Russia
rudely violated'' a peace treaty it signed with Georgia, occupied
the republic by military force and effectively annexed it.
   The entire period in which Georgia has been part of the Soviet
Union has been marked by ``bloody terror and repression,'' the
preamble says.
   Georgia, in the Caucasus Mountains, is bordered by Russia,
Armenia and Azerbaijan. The republic is a major resort area and the
nation's fruit and vegetable basket. Georgia also has mining and
industry.
   Lithuania was the first republic to declare independence, on
March 11. Its parliament agreed to suspend the declaration in
return for the Kremlin's calling off a crippling, 10-week trade
embargo and entering negotiations.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said Monday night that Kremlin officials show no
willingness to compromise and are trying to squeeze Lithuania
economically before scheduled formal negotiations begin at the end
of this month.
   She said another embargo was ``quite a possibility, an ominous
reality that is approaching us.''
   During the first blockade, from April 18 to June 30, Moscow cut
off all oil, most natural gas and many raw materials, forcing
Lithuanian factories to close and thousands to lose jobs.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said she met Wednesday with Moscow Mayor Gavriil
Popov; economist Grigory Yavlinsky, a deputy prime minister of the
Russian Federation; and Gary Hart, the former U.S. senator from
Colorado and 1988 Democratic presidential candidate.
   She said she wanted to discuss possible trade agreements with
Moscow and other Russian cities or regions to ``help us in escaping
a blockade which could be even worse than the previous one.''
   She said Hart brought along ``representatives of a large
investment bank and some other Western companies which have
large-scale plans for investments in Lithuania.'' She declined to
provide names or details.

   Suspected leftist guerrillas killed three
prison guards and a policeman Wednesday during a rescue of a jailed
comrade from a hospital where he was undergoing an eye examination,
authorities reported.
   Santiago police chief Gen. Oscar Tapia said another prison guard
and an unidentified woman, apparently one of the attackers, were
wounded.
   Tapia said the ``extremist commando'' fired with submachine guns
at a group of prisons guards taking the imprisoned leftist, Marco
Antonioletti, for an eye examination.
   Three guards were killed and one was seriously wounded, police
said. The police officer, who was on duty at the hospital, was
killed when he shot back at the attackers.
   Tapia said the guerrillas succeeded in rescuing Antonioletti. He
is the leader of the Lautaro Front, a small radical gang indicted
in the 1989 kiling of a police officer.
   Speaking in Arica, in northern Chile, President Patricio Aylwin
condemned the attack. He noted it came as the government and
National Renewal, the largest opposition party, were nearing
agreement on legislation to free about 260 leftists imprisoned for
political crimes under the former military regime.
   The attack is certain to hamper the agreement, said Jose Antonio
Viera-Gallo, president of the lower house of Congress.

<HEAD>Top-Line U.S. Tanks Enter Saudi Arabia to Replace Older Models</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first of several hundred
top-line American M1A1 tanks rolled into Saudi Arabia Wednesday
night to replace older models and give U.S. forces a bigger edge
against the Iraqis.
   The M1A1 Abrams tanks, the Army's premiere ground combat weapon,
willreplace M1 tanks in all front-line Army units currently
deployed in Saudi Arabia as part of Operation Desert Shield.
   ``The M1 is better than anything the Iraqis have,'' said Army
spokesman Maj. Douglas Bidle, 38, of Arlington Heights, Ill. ``The
M1 gave us an edge. This is a better tank, so obviously this is an
even better edge.''
   The M1A1 has better chemical and biological warfare protection,
enabling the four-man tank crew to operate inside without wearing
protective gear. M1 crews must don protective clothing and hook
into a breathing system.
   The M1 has a 105mm gun, far smaller than the M1A1's 120mm gun,
which can penetrate more and thicker armor.
   Bidle said the M1A1 also has ``improved survivability'' with
better armor, better suspension and a newer transmission and final
drive.
   The new tanks arrived on the civilian-crewed U.S. government
cargo ship, the Norfolk, Va.-based Cape Ducato, after a three-week
trip from Germany plagued by engine trouble.
   A steady stream of M1A1s rumbled out of the cargo hold onto the
dock late Wednesday. Jane's Defense Weekly reported last month that
350 M1s would be swapped for M1A1s.
   The khaki tanks, which will now be repainted in desert
camoflauge, were taken from pre-positioned storage facilities in
Europe where they were part of NATO's inventory to be used in the
event of hostilites.
   The Department of Defense, in announcing the replacement on Oct.
20, said the tanks would have had to be phased out anyway in the
Conventional Forces in Europe treaty expected to be signed by the
end of the year. The treaty is expected to cut the number of tanks
in Europe.
   The Defense Department said it was proposing to the NATO allies
that the older tanks continue to be counted under the treaty.
   Bidle said the M1 tanks being taken out of the desert will
remain in Saudi Arabia as a reserve, to replace those lost in
battle.
   The M1A1s will replace M1s in the 24th Infantry Division, the
197th Infantry Brigade and the 2nd Armored Division that is part of
the First Cavalry Division, Bidle said. All are front-line units in
the 230,000-strong U.S. force sent here to defend Saudi Arabia.
   The Department of Defense has said all tanks will be switched by
the end of the year.
   The only unit in Saudi Arabia that has M1A1 tanks at the moment
is the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment which brought them with them
from Ft. Bliss, Texas.
   It is unclear whether the 200,000 U.S. troops being mobilized by
President Bush to give the United States an offensive capability
will also have M1A1 tanks.

   The government Wednesday squelched a
nationwide strike over its economic policies by barring news
coverage and threatening to fire participating workers.
   In a radio interview, President Cesar Gaviria announced that the
army and air force were waging a major assault on the main base of
the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia. The leftist group,
known by its Spanish acronym FARC, is the country's oldest and
biggest rebel group.
   Radio and newspaper reports said the fighting at the base had
left about 35 guerrillas and at least two soldiers dead. A
spokesman at the Defense Ministry said the total dead was not yet
known.
   Gaviria, who declared the strike illegal, said lftist
guerrillas could take advantage of it to step up violence.
   Military and police reinforcements were increased throughout the
country. Radio and television were prohibited from reporting on the
strike.
   In one of the government's toughest stands in years against
strikers, the president authorized businesses to fire employees who
didn't show up to work.
   Most shops, banks and factories were open Wednesday, despite the
work stoppage called by Colombia's four main labor unions.
   Labor unions had called the strike to protest Gaviria's economic
policies of privatizing many state-run industries and raising
prices of basic goods and services. Workers fear the new measures
will increase poverty and unemployment.
   Despite the government measures, some workers, including those
of the state monopoly telephone company, did observe the strike.
Traffic in major cities was reduced.
   In addition, university students in the capital, Bogota, and in
the northwestern city of Medellin staged demonstrations.
   Also Wednesday, Gaviria confirmed that the military, supported
by jets and helicopter gunships, had been attacking the FARC's main
base in the eastern province of Meta since last week.
   The army also reported that highway ambushes and gunfire attacks
on military bases have killed nine policemen and soldiers the past
three days.
   The FARC and another insurgent group, the National Liberation
Army, are not participating in peace talks between the government
and three other rebel organizations.

   After four years of contentious debate among
environmentalists, homeowners and rival energy suppliers, federal
regulators Wednesday approved construction of a $583 million
pipeline to bring natural gas from Canada to the Northeast.
   In the end, tight energy supplies in New England, New York and
New Jersey outweighed the concerns of opponents of the Iroquois
pipeline, who ranged from wildcat oil drillers in the Southwest to
pop psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers, whose Hudson Valley estate in
New York would be crossed by the line.
   Jerry Langdon, a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, said Wednesday's unanimous decision by his agency
represented a move to make greater use of North American, if not
just U.S., energy supplies.
   Robert J. Reid, president of the Iroquois Gas Transmission
System, a consortium of U.S. and Canadian gas companies and
utilities based in Shelton, Conn., said, ``It was imperative that
we receive FERC approval in November to maintain our timetable for
constructing the pipeline.''
   The pipeline will extend 370 miles from the St. Lawrence River
through the woodlands of upstate New York, beneath the Hudson
River, into affluent sections of western Connecticut and across
Long Island Sound to Long Island. Iroquois officials hope to have
gas flowing to New York and New England by November 1991 and to
complete the line by January 1992.
   Iroquois still has a few regulatory hurdles to clear, including
permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, for waterway
crossings, and import permits from the Energy Department, expected
to be pro forma under the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement.
Thousands of property owners along the route have not yet agreed to
let Iroquois pay to cross their land and Iroquois may have to
settle some of those cases in court.
   ``This has been controversial almost since it was filed in
1986,'' said Susan Court, associate general counsel of the
commission for gas and oil.
   Iroquois is designed to deliver 575 million cubic feet of gas
daily, or enough to meet the energy needs of 1.5 million homes -
though one reason it is being built is to make gas available for
electricity generation.
   The daily amount could supply between three and four large
electric power plants if it were all devoted to that use, though
utilities receiving the gas may use it for any of their customers.
   The gas supplied by Iroquois will increase the energy supply
flowing to the Northeast by 5 percent, according to Reid. Iroquois
could double transmission capacity with additional compressors.
   Existing gas pipelines to the Northeast from U.S. gas fields
have been running at capacity for years. No one sought to build new
ones.
   TransCanada Pipelines Ltd., one of Iroquois' several owners,
estimated the new line will generate $1 billion per year in exports
for Canada. Canada has been supplying natural gas to the United
States since the 1960s, but mostly in the West and Midwest.
   Domestic energy suppliers complained that Iroquois will
discourage production and will compete unfairly with U.S. pipelines
and oil companies.
   Iroquois' gas, however, will be more expensive than U.S. gas and
cheaper than oil, according to a formula approved by the commission
that ties the price to those two commodities.
   ``We really view oil as the competition, not other natural
gas,'' said Iroquois spokesman Gary Davis.

<HEAD>Some Panel Members Regret Recommendation Took So Long</HEAD>

   Some members of a scientific panel said
Wednesday they should have moved faster to draft guidelines for
adding steroids to the treatment of a killer pneumonia in people
with AIDS.
   ``In retrospect, it should have happened more quickly,'' said
Paul Meier, professor of statistics at the University of Chicago
and vice chairman of the panel that convened last May.
   AIDS activists also said the panel took too long, but federal
medical officials said these critics were disregarding some
important facts.
   Still other panel members said the approval process could not
have been significantly speeded up.
   The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases on
Oct. 10 sent an alert to physicians informing them that recent
studies had found benefits among some patients with Pneumocycstis
carinii pneumonia whose treatment was supplemented with steroids.
   Steorids are known to weaken the immune system, and AIDS is a
disease of a collapsing immune system.
   The letter, sent to 2,600 medical practitioners, was based on
the findings of the 17-member panel organized by the institute and
the University of California at San Diego.
   Mike Merdian, executive director of the National Association of
People with AIDS, said the five months it took the panel to come up
with its recommendations was ``unconscionable'' and ``unethical''
but not unusual.
   ``We've long said there are many therapies available we're not
aware of,'' he said.
   But the chairman of the panel rejected the criticism and said
the time it took members to analyze the studies was well spent
trying to agree on the wording of any recommendations as to which
patients would benefit most from steroid treatment, in what doses
and for what period of time.
   The five months was ``a relatively short period,'' said Dr.
Henry Masur, panel chairman and chief of critical care the National
Institutes of Health clinical center. ``I don't think it will ever
get much faster.''
   Since steroids weaken the immune system, ``The whole concept of
giving steroids to someone with AIDS is very novel and
controversial,'' Masur said.
   Among the concerns are that steroids can increase the rate at
which the AIDS virus replicates and make it more likely other
infectious complications develop, he said.
   ``It was vitally important to make sure that steroids
unequivocally improved survival and it was important to prove that
while improving from one disease it didn't cause numerous other
potentially fatal problems,'' he said.
   Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is the biggest killer of people
with AIDS. About 40,000 cases are expected to occur this year in
the United States.
   The broad outlines of a consensus on the steroid issue was
reached May 15, but it wasn't until the end of August that the
experts agreed on the technical details, such as for whom the
therapy should be recommended for and in what doses.
   They decided that the studies showed that patients who benefit
most from steroids along with standard therapy were those who had
moderate or severe Pneumocystis, but that there was no evidence of
benefit for patients with mild disease.
   Bernard Bihari, executive-medical director of the Community
Research Initiative, which treats AIDS patients in New York, said
the issue was too important for lengthy disagreements to stall the
discussions.
   ``They should have locked them in a room and said, `You're not
coming out until you have a statement,''' he said.
   Dr. Samuel Bozzette, assistant professor of medicine at the
University of California at San Diego and a panel member, said that
``in a perfect system, it could have been shorter, but it was not
an unreasonable amount of time.''
   He added that ``when you release one of these consensus
statements, you are setting a worldwide standard of care, and one
has to make sure that the recommendations are as carefully
considered as possible.''
   But he also agreed with Meier that the documents could have been
passed around more quickly and ``day-to-day processes could have
moved quicker.''
   Meier said that the panel, which took about three months to
complete its part of the task, ould have achieved that goal in
about one month, but nobody set a deadline.
   ``A failure to recognize it (the process) was dragging is where
I would fault us,'' Meier said.

<HEAD>Study: Angry Teen-Agers Likely To Have High Cholesterol as Adults</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf and 6th graf to CORRECT reference to Williams,

   Hostile teen-agers are likely to grow up to be
adults who have high cholesterol, according to a study that finds
new links between anger and heart trouble.
   For years, many experts assumed that hard-driving, impatient
people with classic Type A personalities were at high risk of heart
attacks. But many have grown skeptical of this theory, and some now
believe that the truly lethal personality trait is hostility and
anger.
   ``People with high hostility at age 19 tend to have high
cholesterol levels at 40,'' Dr. Redford B. Williams of Duke
University said Wednesday.
   Williams' study was among several presented at the annual
meeting of the American Heart Association to suggest that hostile
people are more prone to heart trouble - both because of the
effects of adrenaline and other hormones on their bodies and their
tendency to have unhealthy living habits.
   One report from Yale University researchers found that people
who react to situations with strong emotions, particularly anger,
are especially likely to die of cardiac arrest.
   Williams' study, conducted with Dr. Ilene C. Siegler, was based
on a followup 20 years later of 830 people who took personality
tests while students at the University of North Carolina in the
mid-1960s.
   They found that those who scored high on a hostility scale in
college tended to have high levels of total cholesterol in their
blood but relatively low amounts of HDL, the protective so-called
``good cholesterol.''
   ``One explanation for this is the effect of hormones that
mobilize lipids from fat stores,'' said Williams.
   When people get angry, their bodies pump out stress hormones,
such as adrenaline, which trigger the body to release fat into the
bloodstream to provide energy.
   ``Stress hormones give you a Hershey bar when they fire off,''
Williams said.
   Hostility may work to raise cholesterol and harm the heart in
other ways, too. Other Duke research found that alumni who were
especially rebellious or hostile were more likely to smoke
cigarettes. This suggests that hostile people are less health
conscious.
   In Williams' view, hostile people tend to be suspicious as well
as easily angered.
   ``They are the people who, when they stand in the 12-item line
at the supermarket, always count how many items other people
have,'' said Williams. ``They always suspect that other people are
trying to weasel through.''
   In another study at Duke, researchers set up an experiment to
see how people would respond when bothered by a technician while
trying to solve word puzzles. Hostile people tended to react by
getting angry at the harrassment, and their blood pressures rose.
   ``I think the effects of hostility are preventable or even
reversible'' through stress management techniques, he said.
   The Yale study, by Dr. Lynda Powell, was based on eight to 10
years of followup of 929 men who had survived heart attacks.
   The researchers interviewed the men and scored how emotionally
aroused they became by observing such things as tense facial
expressions, rapid speech, quick gestures, rapid blinking, an
aggressive attitude and other clues from their posture and words.
   ``We think hostility is a critical part of emotional arousal,
but it's too specific,'' Powell said. ``Extreme joy can trigger the
same thing. It is the resulting surge of stress hormones that puts
the person at increased risk of death.''
   Powell believes that chronic exposure to these hormones, which
help the body gear up for emergencies, can damage the heart and
trigger cardiac arrest.
   Her study found that those who scored high in emotional
reactivity were three times more likely than more even tempered
people to die of cardiac arrest, and their risk was five times
higher if they also had high cholesterol levels.

   In an effort to solidify support for U.S.
moves in the Persian Gulf, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
will meet this weekend with the foreign ministers of three African
countries that are members of the U.N. Security Council.
   He hopes to persuade them to support a resolution authorizing
the use of force to expel Iraqi invaders from Kuwait. Baker last
week lined up the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France. They are
permanent members of the Council and could have killed the
resolution with their veto.
   The three African countries are Ethiopia, Ivory Coast and Zaire.
Enlisting them to support the Bush administration would give the
toughened U.S. stance broaer approval among neutral and Third
World nations.
   Baker's meetings with the African foreign ministers will be held
Saturday in Geneva. He then will fly to Paris to meet Sunday with
the foreign ministers of Romania and Finland and hold another
session with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.
   Later Sunday, Baker will meet President Bush in Paris for a
34-nation summit where a landmark treaty to reduce NATO and Warsaw
Pact tanks and other non-nuclear weapons will be signed.
   The following weekend Baker will go to Colombia to confer with
President Cesar Gaviria. Colombia also is a member of the Security
Council this month.
   Baker, at a White House news conference Wednesday, said the
administration had not decided to use force, but wanted that option
to be credible in hopes of persuading Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to give up Kuwait.
   ABC News said Wednesday evening the administration had decided
to seek approval of a U.N. resolution before the end of this month.
But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said later, ``No
decision has been made'' on whether to submit such a resolution.
   Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, Egypt, Turkey and the exiled
government of Kuwait all assured Baker during his recent eight-day
trip to the Persian Gulf and Europe that they would not oppose the
resolution.
   Baker leaves Washington on Thursday, stopping first in Brussels
to meet with the 12-nation European Community. The key issue is
whether they are ready to add to their commitments to poorer
nations, such as Turkey and Egypt, that are suffering economically
by adhering to the trade cutoff with Iraq approved in August by the
Security Council.
   In the meantime, King Hassan of Morocco is trying to organize an
Arab summit meeting to head off war with diplomacy.
   ``We are in favor of any diplomatic approaches that can move us
in the direction of a political and peaceful'' settlement, Baker
said. ``But we are not in favor of diplomatic approaches that call
for partial solutions.''
   Baker was referring to the longstanding U.S. demand that Iraq
withdraw its troops unconditionally from Kuwait before any
discussion on related issues are held. Saudi Arabia, a key U.S.
ally against Saddam Hussein, has taken the same position with
regard to an Arab summit.

   Here is the text of this year's Thanksgiving
proclamation issued Wednesday by President Bush.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   In the first Presidential Thanksgiving Day proclamation, George
Washington observed that ``it is the Duty of all Nations to
acknowledge the Providence of Almighty God, to obey his Will, to be
grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore His protection and
favor.'' As a people who have long enjoyed unparalleled material
prosperity and the priceless blessings of peace and freedom, we
Americans cannot fail to fulfill this great, yet joyous, duty.
Thus, we pause each year on Thanksgiving Day to express our
gratitude for the goodness and generosity of our Creator and to ask
His continued protection and guidance in all our endeavors, both as
individuals and as a nation.
   The observance of Thanksgiving was a cherished tradition in
America long before George Washington called his countrymen ``to
the service of that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent
Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.''
Indeed, we trade the tradition of giving thanks back to some of the
earliest settlers in this country - not only the Pilgrims at
Plymouth but also early colonists at Jamestown, New Amsterdam, and
St. Augustine. With hands clasped in prayer and hearts full of
gratitude, these men and women gave public thanks to God for having
been sustained through times of hardship and peril.
   William Bradford's account of the experience of the settlers at
Plymouth Colony is not only a moving description of the trials of
emigration to a wilderness but also captures their profound faith
and contains a timeless exhortation to succeeding generations:
   ``Being thus passed the vast ocean ... they had now no friends
to welcome them, nor inns to entertain or refresh their
weatherbeaten bodies, no houses or much less towns to repair to ...
And for the season it was winter, and they that know the winters of
that country know them to be sharp and violent ... Besides, what
could they see but a hideous and desolate wilderness? ... Neither
could they, as it were, go to the top of Pisgah, to view from this
wilderness a more goodly country to feed their hopes, for which way
soever they turned their eyes (save upwards to the heavens) they
could have little solace or content ... What could now sustain them
but the spirit of God and His grace? They cried to the Lord, and He
heard their voice, and looked on their adversity. Let them
therefore praise the Lord, because He is good, and His mercies
endure forever.''
   The historic observance of a day of thanksgiving at Plymouth in
1621 was one of many occasions on which our ancestors paused to
acknowledge their dependence on the mercy and favor of Divine
Providence. Today, on this Thanksgiving Day, likewise observed
during a season of celebration and harvest, we have added cause for
rejoicing: the seeds of democratic thought sown on these shores
continue to take took around the world. In Central and Eastern
Europe, in Latin America, and elsewhere, courageous men and women
are beginning to reap the blessings of freedom and self-government.
Peoples who once suffered under the heavy yoke of totalitarianism
have begun to claim the liberty to which all are heirs.
   Our gratitude for the rights and opportunities we enjoy as
Americans may be measured by how carefully we use the preserve
these gifts, as when we cultivate in our children a love of freedom
and an understanding of the responsibilities that freedom demands
of us. We tend the precious blossom of our liberty when we recall
the example of our ancestors and strive to ensure that our own
lives are firmly rooted in faith. Like our forebears, we must
cherish the values and beliefs that are the foundation of strong,
loving families and caring communities and recognize the importance
of learning and hard work, because these are the wellspring of
progress and prosperity.
   The great freedom and prosperity with which we have been blessed
is cause for rejoicing - and it is equally a responsibility.
Indeed, Scripture tells us that much will be asked of those to whom
much has been given. Our ``errand in the wilderness,'' begun more
than 350 years ago, is not yet complete. Abroad, we are working
toward a new partnership of nations. At home, we seek lasting
solutions to the problems facing our nation and pray for a society
``with liberty and justice for all,'' the alleviation of want, and
the restoration of hope to all our people.
   This Thanksgiving, as we enjoy the company of family and
friends, let us gratefully turn our hears to God, the loving Source
of all Life and Liberty. Let us seek His forgiveness for our
shortcomings and transgressions and renew our determination to
remain a people worthy of His continued favor and protection.
Acknowledging our dependence on the Almighty, obeying His
Commandments, and reaching out to help those who do not share fully
in this nation's bounty is the most heartfelt and meaningful answer
we can give the timeless appeal of the Psalmist: ``O give thanks to
the Lord for He is good; for his steadfast love endures forever.''
   Finally, on this Thanksgiving Day, let us also remember all
those Americans abroad who labor to advance the ideals for which
this great nation stands. Whether Peace Corps volunteers or
military or diplomatic personnel, these selfless individuals often
accept great personal risks and sacrifices to serve our country.
Let us remember, in particular, those Americans held hostage and
members of the Armed Forces serving in the Persian Gulf region. On
this day, let us pray for their well-being and their safe return to
the United States. And let us be thankful that such fine men and
women are still willing to answer the call of duty to country and
to defend the cause of liberty.
   NOW, THEREFORE, I, George Bush, President of the United States
of America, do hereby call upon the American people to observe
Thursday, November 22, 1990, as a National Day of Thanksgiving and
to gather together in homes and places of worship on that day of
thanks to affirm by their prayers and their gratitude the many
blessings God has bestowed upon us.
   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set by hand this fourteenth
day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and
ninety, and of the Independence of the United States of America the
two hundred and fifteenth.

   A member of the police department who
sunk his teeth a little too deep into his work will get a second
chance after being suspended for gnawing on a squad car dashboard.
   Aptly named Chance, the 20-month-old German shepherd police dog
``will be returning to work in the near future'' after a refresher
course at the State Police Canine Training Center, Deputy Chief
Joseph Bibisi said.
   Union officials and a state police canine instructor argued the
dog's case after he chewed up the dashboard Oct. 8, causing an
estimated $300 to $400 in damages.
   They said Chance was merely frustrated he could not get out of
the cruiser to help his partner. Patrolman William Hertler was
struggling with a man believed to be suicidal.
   It wasn't the first time Chance's teeth had brought him trouble
since graduating from training school in May.
   A woman complained to the department after Chance bit her Aug.
21. Police said the woman had jumped on an officer's back and
refused orders to get off.
   Two days later, Chance bit a man who reportedly assaulted
Hertler.

   The Philippine government will settle its $5
billion racketeering lawsuit against Imelda Marcos and former
President Ferdinand Marcos' estate if it gets at least $250
million, a government official said.
   The government tentatively agreed to accept 60 percent of funds
in five Hong Kong banks held by Imelda Marcos and the estate, said
David Castro, head of the Philippine Commission on Good Government.
   The amount must equal at least $250 million for the agreement to
stand, Castro said.
   ``We want to know the amount first,'' Castro said Tuesday at the
Philippine consulate. ``If the money's not there, then we have to
find it somewhere else.''
   President Corazon Aquino established the commission to recover
billions of dollars allegedly taken from the Philippine treasury by
the Marcoses during the late dictator's 20-year rule.
   The government filed a civil racketeering lawsuit against Mrs.
Marcos and the estate as part of the recovery effort.
   Castro said he did not expect a formal settlement before Dec.
10, when attorneys for both sides are expected in U.S. District
Court in Los Angeles.

   A teen-age mother who suffocated her
newborn and left it in a trash can has been sentenced to two years
in prison and 10 years of birth control.
   The sentence was part of a plea bargain between prosecutors and
attorneys for Tracy Lachele Wilder, 17, who had been charged with
murder. Ms. Wilder pleaded guilty Tuesday to manslaughter as part
of the agreement.
   Circuit Judge Lawrence P. Haddock said the sentence was prompted
by what he said was the girl's apparent naivete about the results
of her promiscuity.
   ``Their whole defense was that she just didn't know she was
regnant and was trying to run away from having a baby,'' Haddock
said.
   A cleanup crew at University Medical Center found the newborn in
April in a trash can in a rest room in the hospital's emergency
room waiting area. Miss Wilder, who had gone to the emergency room
seeking treatment, admitted giving birth in the rest room and
hiding the baby.
   An autopsy showed the baby suffocated from a wad of tissue
stuffed in her mouth.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Roman Catholic bishops on Wednesday
adopted their first comprehensive guidelines on human sexuality,
portraying it in exalting terms and calling for it to be taught in
Catholic schools.
   Against some opposition and attempts at delay, the document was
approved by a strong voice vote by the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops.
   It says sexual education should be taught in schools and
parishes as well as in families, a provision strongly opposed by
several bishops who said many parents want such education kept in
the home. One said families might remove their children from
Catholic schools if sex education is required.
   Describing sexuality as a ``wonderful gift,'' the bishops say
they approach the subject with a ``deep and abiding sense of
appreciation, wonder and respect.''
   They add:
   ``We are dealing with a divine gift, a primal dimension of each
person, a mysterious blend of spirit and body, which shares in
God's own creative love and life. ...
   ``Sexuality is a dimension of one's restless heart, which
continually yearns for interpersonal communion, glimpsed and
experienced to varying degrees in this life, ultimately finding
full oneness only in God, here, and hereafter.''
   The 185-page document, called ``Human Sexuality: A Catholic
Perspective for Education and Lifelong Learning,'' was developed by
a special task force, including experts in various fields.
   Auxiliary Bishop William Newman of Baltimore, said the effort
was to present the subject in ``positive terms and with flow.''
Much of it has a lilting sweep in phrasing.
   ``We are created not as angels or pure spirits, but as human
beings, embodied and sexual,'' the document says.
   ``The gift of sexuality involves the whole person because it
permeates all facets of the human personality: the physical, the
psycho-emotional, the intellectual, the spiritual and ethical and
the social,'' the bishops say.
   ``Sexuality prompts each of us from within, calling us to
personal as well as spiritual growth and drawing us out from self
to interpersonal bonds and commitments with others, both women and
men.''
   The document affirms the church's traditional teaching that
condones intercourse only in marriage.
   ``Like all our human powers and freedoms, sexuality can be
channeled for good or ill ... can be abused, sometimes
intentionally, sometimes through immaturity or ignorance...
   ``Given how important sexuality is ... such errors in judgment
frequently have a profound impact for ill on ne's psyche, human
commitments and relationship with God,'' it says.
   Bishop Kenneth E. Untener of Saginaw, Mich. noted the document
mentions that some dissent from the church ban against
contraception and urges they pray and reconsider.
   He said they might respond, ``We will if you will.'' Refering to
widespread disagreement with the contraception ban among Catholics,
he urged listening to them.
   ``If we don't, it will cause great damage to the church at
large,'' he told fellow bishops, saying the church's credibility
depended on it.
   Some bishops complained that many parents wanted sexual
education kept in the home, and not taught in school.
   Auxiliary Bishop Austin Vaughan of New York, protested that the
document had been shaped without wide parental consultation. He
sought unsuccessfully to get it tabled.
   He said if sexual education is required, many parents ``will
pull their children out of Catholic schools.''
   Considerable debate came on a section dealing with
homosexuality, and a move was made to insert a 1986 Vatican
declaration that homosexuality is an ``objective disorder''
involving a tendency to moral evil.
   However, Archbishop John Quinn of San Francisco, said that the
Vatican's philosophical analysis had been misinterpreted to mean
``the person was intrinsically disordered and intrinsically bad.''
   The matter was put in a footnote, along with an explanation of
the distinction between the technical and personal implications.
   ``Homosexual orientation, because it is not freely chosen, is
not sinful,'' an added line said.
   The portion on teaching about sexuality focuses on the different
stages of life, childhood, adolescence and adulthood.
   The bishops, on the third day of their four-day annual meeting,
also approved a major aid program to long-suppressed churches of
Eastern Europe.
   A national collection was to be made for three, and perhaps five
years, to fund the operation.
   Asked how much was expected from such fund drives, Archbishop
John L. May of St. Louis told a news conference,``Millions.''
   He said other special drives have yielded more than $10 million
annually.

   Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine on
Wednesday challenged Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for
leadership of the government and the Conservative Party.
   Heseltine, who will stand against Mrs. Thatcher in a ballot
among the 372 Conservative legislators on Tuesday, accused her of
splitting the party on Europe and alienating voters with an
unpopular local government tax.
   The challenge by Heseltine, a handsome, self-made millionaire
who espouses a ``caring capitalism'' in contrast to Mrs. Thatcher's
rigorous free-market views, poses the biggest threat to her
survival since she won power more than 11 years ago.
   ``I am persuaded that I will now have a better prospect than
Mrs. Thatcher of leading the Conservatives to a fourth general
election victory,'' Heseltine said.
   Kenneth Baker, chairman of the troubled Conservative Party, said
the 65-year-old prime minister will fight to the end to keep power
- through a possible three ballots ending Nov. 29.
   ``This contest is unwanted and unnecessary,'' Baker said. ``I am
sure she will win on the first ballot.''
   Other ministers in the 22-member Cabinet said it was wrong to
challenge Mrs. Thatcher now, with about 16,000 British troops in
the Persian Gulf and war possible against Iraq.
   Heseltine, who needs 159 votes in the first secret ballot to
force a runoff, said more than 100 legislators have pledged
support. Mrs. Thatcher needs 214 votes to win outright.
   Press Association, the domestic news agency, reported Wednesday
night that it had contacted 215 Conservative lawmakers on the
leadership question. It said 54 percent supported Mrs. Thatcher, 19
percent favored Heseltine and 27 percent refused to answer.
   If a second ballot is needed it will be held Nov. 27 and may
well bring in other contenders from the Cabinet, such as Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd. If no one won outright then, a third and
final vote among the last three top contenders will be held Nov.
29.
   Heseltine, defense secretary until he stalked out of Mrs.
Thatcher's Cabinet in 1986 in a Europe-related dispute, stepped
forward a day after her former deputy prime minister delivered a
scathing attack on her attitude toward Europe.
   The onslaught by Sir Geoffrey Howe, who resigned Nov. 1,
appeared to have tipped Heseltine into his along awaited bid for
the leadership.
   Rebellion has simmered in the party for more than a year, partly
over Mrs. Thatcher's isolation in the stepped-up drive for greater
European unity. Britain alone rejected an agreement last month in
principle for a single central bank and single currency for the
12-nation European community.
   But Mrs. Thatcher's crisis is rooted in the Tories' 16-month lag
in opinion polls, mainly because of high interest rates,
double-digit inflation and an unpopular local per-capita tax dubbed
the ``poll tax.''
   Heseltine said that if he wins he will order an immediate review
of that tax, which he said left ``a lingering sense of injustice.''
   Mrs. Thatcher is the longest-serving head of government in the
Western world, and Britain's longest-serving prime minister in this
century.
   The attempt to overthrow her threatened to become a dirty,
no-holds-barred campaign for the leadership of the party which has
a majority in the 650-member House of Commons. The party leader is
automatically the prime minister.
   On Tuesday, the 4-million circulation Sun newspaper carried
stories with intimate details of the private lives of some of
Heseltine's known supporters, including that one had a mistress and
another had visited a gay club.
   Mrs. Thatcher will vote for herself by proxy Tuesday from Paris,
where she will be at a 35-nation summit of leaders of East and
West.
   Her supporters expressed dismay at the prospect of the party
dumping the leader who faced down the unions, led the war in the
Falkland Islands and whose grity brand of nationalism helped
revive the country's self-image as a European power and America's
No. 1 ally.
   ``Her leadership qualities are the greatest political assets
which the Conservative Party and our nation have,'' said party
chairman Baker.
   Hurd, who could pose the biggest threat of all to Mrs. Thatcher
if she fails to stop Heseltine in the first ballot, said on
Wednesday the challenge was a mistake. But he added he agreed with
many of Howe's criticisms.
   In the House of Commons on Wednesday afternoon, Mrs. Thatcher
sat in her usual front-bench seat, occasionally smiling thinly, as
opposition legislators taunted her chancellor of the exchequer,
John Major.
   ``Why don't you line up with Heseltine?'' a legislator shouted
as Major defended the government's economic record and promised
better times ahead.
   Heseltine left the Cabinet after Mrs. Thatcher ordered him to
halt a campaign for a European consortium to rescue the British
helicopter-maker, Westland, instead of a U.S.-led consortium she
favored.

   A multicolored volleyball floats before your
eyes. There is a hole in the ball big enough for your hand. You
insert your fingers, feel for the edge.
   But there is no edge.
   There is no ball.
   There is only air and a remarkable three-dimensional illusion
created through a process that leapfrogs laser technology and may
fulfill some of holography's unkept promises.
   The process is phscolography, (pronounced skoh-LAH'-grah-fee), a
combination of photography, holography, sculpture and computer
graphics.
   Its inventors at the Illinois Institute of Technology and the
University of Illinois at Chicago say phscolograms are easier and
cheaper to create than laser-constructed holograms, a factor that
could hasten the long-awaited advent of 3-D television.
   They say phscolography's biggest advantage over holography is
the ease with which it can transform computer-generated images into
3-D illusions. Most holograms are of physical objects.
   ``This thing can do impossible images,'' said Thomas DeFanti, a
co-founder of UIC's Electronic Visualization Laboratory and a
member of the artists-and-scientists collaborative that developed
phscolography.
   For example, the phscologram that resembled a blue, green, red
and yellow volleyball was actually a computer-generated model of
the polio virus. It is one of 47 phscolograms on display at
Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. The exhibit, titled
``Science in Depth,'' runs through Jan. 13.
   Among the exhibit's most intriguing pieces are eight
phscolographic renderings of mathematical concepts. These are not
numbers but bright abstract forms with titles like ``Norton Fractal
I'' and ``Strange Attractor'' that essentially are
computer-generated maps of how certain systems of mathematical
equations behave.
   ``It's exciting to have a way for people to look at these
visualizations,'' DeFanti said.
   He said that by looking at a 3-D visualization of an abstract
concept, scientists can sometimes make connections they would
otherwise have missed.
   The museum's works also include 3-D architectural photos,
visualizations of various molecules, and a cross-shaped montage of
images - tumbling dice, human head and hands, and an AIDS virus -
meant to suggest the roles of hope and chance in finding a cure for
the deadly disease.
   ``We're marrying art, science and math,'' said sculptor Ellen
Sandor, a leader in phscolography research since 1983.
   Three-dimensional imaging goes bck to the early days of
photography but got a big boost in the 1960s when lasers first were
used to construct holograms. Some scientists predicted that
holographic home entertainment centers would become common by the
year 2000.
   Phscolograms resemble holograms but have more in common with 3-D
postcards.
   The cards work because they contain two or more different
images, only one of which can be seen from any given angle. Because
of the different positions of a person's eyes, each eye sees a
slightly different image. The brain interprets this to give
three-dimensional information.
   A phscologram is like a transparent slide of a 3-D postcard
containing 13 images that have been sliced and spliced on a
computer screen into 8,000 extremely thin vertical columns. The
slide is overlaid with a piece of opaque film called a barrier
screen containing 8,000 corresponding slits.
   The phscologram is mounted over a light source, which projects
the image toward the viewer. Most of the phscolograms exhibited in
Chicago are 20 inches high and 24 inches wide.
   DeFanti said the technology could easily be adapted to a
computer display for still images.
   He also said it also could work for moving pictures, although
conventional television picture tubes do not provide enough image
resolution. The liquid crystal display, or LCD, technology of small
televisions such as the Sony Watchman, offer more hope for 3-D TV,
De Fanti said.
   Stephen A. Benton, a professor of media technology at the
Masschusetts Institute of Technology and a recognized leader in
holography research, said color and computer-generated holograms
are in the works.
   He conceded that holography has not developed as rapidly as some
experts had hoped in the late 1960s, but he said holography
research ultimately will yield clearer, better 3-D images than
phscolography.
   ``We're more out on the long-term research end of it,'' he said.
``We don't think the slit or barrier-screen approach can get us
where we need to go.''

   President Bush clashed Wednesday with leaders
of Congress trying to limit his war-making powers but assured
anxious lawmakers he has not decided to use military force to push
Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
   In a two-hour meeting, Democratic leaders insisted that Bush
must seek congressional approval before taking military action in
the Persian Gulf. He refused to give any such guarantee.
   ``The president did not indicate either a commitment to do that
or refusal to do that,'' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
said later.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Bush would follow the
Constitution, but he pointedly added, ``It's a question of what the
Constitution requires.''
   While acknowledging that only Congress has authority to declare
war, Baker said, ``There are many, many circumstances and
situations indeed where there could be action taken against
American citizens or against American interests that would call for
a very prompt and substantial response.''
   Fears of war in the Middle East were flamed by Bush's decision
last week to send upwards of 200,000 more troops to the gulf,
nearly doubling the American military force there and adding what
Bush called an offensive capability.
   Reading from his notes of the meeting, House Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill., quoted Bush as saying, ``We haven't crossed
any particular Rubicon here'' with the latest increase.
   For his own part, Michel said, ``I don't look for the kind of
action ... some people are anticipating, real soon. We want to
continue to counsel with our allies'' and the United Nations.
   However, Michel said he was ``a little distressed'' that some
participants in the meeting with Bush had spoken of waiting up to
18 months for sanctions against Iraq to take full effect. He said
that was ``far beyond the time frame I thought appropriate.''
   According to an administration source, House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., told Bush that waiting a year or a year
and a half for sanctions to force Iraq out of Kuwait was a better
choice than war. Michel told bush he could not wait that long, and
Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the House Appropriations
defense subcommittee, said the president should be prepared to move
soon, the source said.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said Democrats were unanimous in
counseling patience.
   ``How long are you willing to wait it out to save lives? My
answer is, a fair amount of time.''
   Baker said the sanctions are working but might not be enough to
force an Iraqi withdrawal. ``I don't think we can say that today
with certainty. We know they are beginning to bite,'' Baker said.
   ABC News said Wednesday evening the Bush administration had
decided to seek approval of a United Nations resolution authorizing
force against Iraq - for which Baker has been seeking support in
his recent overseas trip - before the end of the month. But Marlin
Fitzwater, the president's press secretary, said, ``No decision has
been made'' on submitting such a resolution.
   Some lawmakers, including Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole,
have called for a special session of Congress to vote on the gulf
crisis, but that proposal appeared dead Wednesday. ``There is no
support for it on either side,'' Senate Foreign Relations Chairman
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said as he left the White House.
   Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., senior Republican on the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, said there was a bipartisan agreement
that ``it would be just poor judgment to have it right now.''
   However, there will be congressional hearings. The Senate
Foreign Relations Committee tentatively planned to hear from Baker
on Tuesday. The Senate Armed Services Committee planned hearings
Nov. 27 through Nov. 29, the week after the Thanksgiving holiday.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said the campaign against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein already has been damaged by the arguments
about the president's ability to commit American forces to war.
   ``If I was Saddam Hussein, I would be doing handsprings of
joy,'' Helms said.
   Baker, at a briefing for reporters, said he hoped the nation
could send a ``consistent and uniform signal.'' Referring to the
debate over gulf policy, Baker said, ``Someone said one time that
democracy can sometimes be messy and indeed that's true.
   ``And I suppose it is easier to some extent in situations like
this to operate as he (Saddam) does by way of dictatorship,'' Baker
said.
   Baker readily acknowledged there are sharp differences between
Congress and the White House about Bush's authority to commit
troops to action.
   ``There is a genuine and substantial debate between the
executive and legislative branches of this government and has been
for quite some time about whether or not the War Powers Act, for
instance, is constitutional,'' Baker said. ``We think there are
provisions in there that are clearly unconstitutional.''
   The 1973 act, prompted by congressional discontent over the way
U.S. troops were used during the Vietnam war, requires the
president to notify Congress within 48 hours after American forces
are put into a situation where they may become engaged in
hostilities. It also requires those forces to be withdrawn within
90 days if Congress doesn't declare war.
   Baker refused to elaborate on his pledge that Bush would abide
by the Constitution.
   ``What you cannot do in this period is speak to hypotheticals,''
the secretary said. ``The president feels very strongly, as prior
presidents before him have, that he has a firm obligation to
protect American citizens.''
   Baker said the huge buildup of U.S. troops did not mean the
United States was plunging into war, but ``it is important, since
we cannot rule out the option of force, that we lay an appropriate
political and military foundation for that option.''

   Defense Minister Moshe Arens called the
35-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied
territories a war on Wednesday, the eve of the anniversary of the
Palestinian declaration of statehood.
   Israel imposed widespread curfews in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip to prevent violence. The move confined more than 420,000
of the territories' 1.7 million Arabs to their homes.
   In other developments:
   -A Jew, a follower of assassinated militant Rabbi Meir Kahane,
was arrested on suspicion he stabbed a Jewish butcher and his Arab
employee on Wednesday, wounding them, Israel radio said. It
reported the man said he attacked the two because he opposed Arab
labor in Israel.
   -Labor Minister David Magen said the government was considering
a policy that could cut by more than half the number of
Palestinians working in Israel. The 60,000 freed-up jobs would go
to Soviet Jewish immigrants and unemployed Israelis. About 110,000
Palestinians from the territories now work in Israel.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization's parliament-in-exile
declared independence for the West Bank and Gaza Strip at a meeting
in Algiers on Nov. 15, 1988. Some Arab and third-world nations
recognize the action, but Israel and most Western countries do not.
   Foreign Minister David Levy told Parliament on Wednesday, ``If
anyone is dreaming about a Palestinian state, we will not allow it
to be formed.''
   Arens said Israel's struggle to put down the uprising was a
``war that cannot be fought through normal legal channels.''
   He was defending Tuesday's six-month detention without trial of
Radwan Abu Ayash, chief of the Arab Journalists Union, and Ziad Abu
Ziyad, editor of a Hebrew-language Palestinian weekly.
   The government said the two were PLO activists who helped write
leaflets encouraging recent stabbings of Israelis.
   Arens told Israel television most Palestinians in the occupied
lands had lost hope in the ``intefadeh,'' or uprising.
   `` They began this intefadeh with great expectactions that they
would push Israel to the wall, so it would have no other choice but
to form a Palestinian state ... today the percent of the population
in the West Bank and Gaza that has such hopes for the intefadeh is
very small.''
   Despite the curfews, however, some Palestinians began
anniversary celebrations early.
   In Gaza City, schoolgirls marched and chanted pro-PLO and
pro-Iraqi slogans, Arab reports said.
   They said dozens of Palestinians marched in Nablus, in the West
Bank, and set off fireworks.
   Masked activists handed out leaflets at a rally at Bethlehem
University pledging the uprising would ``continue until we burn the
land under the occupiers.''
   Students clapped, whistled and sang the Palestinian anthem,
``Biladi, Biladi'' - ``My Homeland, My Homeland.''
   University spokesman Mousa Darwish told the rally Palestinian
aspirations for statehood persist.
   ``Some people say we have independence only on paper,'' Darwish
said. ``I say it is a growing hope in our hearts, surrounded by
barbed wire, our martyrs and our wounded. It is not an illusion. It
is a fact.''
   Arens said Israel would triumph over the anti-Israeli violence
that followed a riot on Jerusalem's Temple Mount in which at least
17 Palestinians were killed as police fired on stone-throwers.
   ``A large part of our population is trained in the military, a
part of the population is armed and is on the streets, there is the
police, there is the army, there are the security forces and the
Civil Guard. We will triumph,'' Arens said on Israel television.
   Near the town of Jenin in the West Bank, the stabbed body of
Hussein Mahmid, 37, was found in a barrel. Arab reporters said he
was killed for collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   His death brought to 299 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaboration.
   At least 773 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians in the uprising, which began in December 1987.
Fifty-two Israelis have died in the violence.

   A congressional report released Wednesday
blames the Office of Mangement and Budget for allowing a
proliferation of misleading health claims on foods.
   Health claims have been increasing since 1987 when, at the
urging of the White House agency, the Food and Drug Administration
proposed to permit health claims on food labels, the report said.
   The next year, OMB prohibited the FDA from publishing a rule to
bar some of the most misleading claims.
   The White House office ``can take credit for supermarket shelves
being flooded with misleading health claims,'' said Rep. Ted Weiss,
D-N.Y., chairman of the House Governmental Operations subcommittee
on human resources and intergovernmental relations.
   The report was based on an investigation by the subcommittee and
was approved by the full committee.
   OMB last year abandoned its opposition and allowed the FDA to
propose a new regulation to curtail health claims. However,
legislation recently passed by Congress and signed by President
Bush also restricts those claims, and in some ways conflicted with
the still-pending proposal.
   Spokesman Jeff Nesbit said Wednesday the FDA ``is reviewing the
bill ... The agency intends as soon as possible to either
re-propose the health claims regulation or amend it to incorporate
the congressional language.''
   OMB declined to comment on the report.

   Thousands of workers nationwide marched Wednesday
to protest a proposed social security tax, an issue that has allied
Communists and conservatives in the hopes they could topple the
Socialist government.
   The tax controversy coincides with militant national protests by
high school students demanding more government spending to improve
their schools. Together, the two campaigns present Premier Michel
Rocard with his greatest challenge since taking office in 1988.
   Rocard announced Wednesday evening that the government would
allocate an additional $900,000 to improve the high school system.
   The biggest protest Wednesday was in Paris, where at least
10,000 members of a leftist labor federation marched to the
National Assembly. One worker wore a Rocard mask, a Santa Claus
costume and a sign that said: ``His gift? A tax.''
   About 4,000 workers marched in Marseille, 3,500 in Le Havre,
3,000 in Toulouse, 2,600 in Lyon, 1,300 in Grenoble and thousands
more in other cities.
   The demonstrations proceeded with few disturbances, unlike the
most recent student protests Monday, when gangs of toughs went on a
looting and car-burning rampage during a march in Paris by 100,000
youths.
   The only significant confrontation Wednesday occurred in
Marseille, where marchers tried to push away barricades outside a
government building. Riot police fired tear gas to repel the
demonstrators.
   Rocard has accused his critics of deliberately misrepresenting
the proposed tax - known as the Generalized Social Contribution. It
would be levied at 1.1 percent of all income, including investment
earnings.
   The government insists that low- and middle-income workers will
come out ahead under the plan because of adjustments made to other
levies. But critics say the net effect will be to tax individuals
more and companies less, and they also worry that the levy rate may
rise in future years.
   The debate over the tax has taken on added significance because
the Communist Party has committed itself to voting with the
rightist opposition for a no-confidence motion over the bill. Such
a motion is expected next week in the National Assembly, and the
government could fall if it passed.
   The Socialists hold only 272 of the National Assembly's 577
seats, 17 short on an outright majority. They have defeated
previous censure motions through abstentions by the Communists, who
hold 26 seats.

   The Food and Drug Administration took action
Wednesday aimed at making it harder for generic drug companies to
cheat on tests needed to win agency approval for their products.
   The FDA said it has begun requiring all testing laboratories to
retain for five years samples of drugs tested to ensure that
generics are substantially the same as the brand name drug from
which they are copied.
   Currently, the labs are not required to retain samples.
   In some previous instances of cheating, generic drug companies
have substituted a brand-name drug for their own in tests to
determine whether the two versions act the same in the body.
   In these instances where products were switched, the brand name
drug was compared with itself, rather than with the product to be
approved.
   The agency said the samples that now have to be retained can be
used as evidence in investigations into wrongdoing.
   The requirement applies to all drug products, whether generic or
brand name, that are tested for equivalence of action.
   Genberic drugs are sold by companies who manufacture them after
the patent on the brand-name equivalent has expired.

<HEAD>Soviet Television Undergoes Shakeup; Print Media Changes Coming</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet government announced a shake-up of the
state television monopoly Wednesday, creating four separate
companies in a move intended to increase competition and improve
quality.
   Leonid P. Kravchenko, 52, was named as the new head of the State
Committee for Television and Radio, known in Russian as
Gosteleradio. He has been the director-general of the official Tass
news agency since 1988.
   He replaces Mikhail Nenashev, who will become chairman of the
Soviet Committee on the Press. Nanashev is under orders to propose
fundamental reforms in the structure of the print media.
   Both personnel changes were made by decree of President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev. Kravchenko's successor as head of Tass has not been
named.
   The government newspaper, Izvestia, reported that instead of one
Central Television Station with four channels, Gosteleradio has
decided to make each channel an independent company with ``full
creative and commercial independence.''
   The first company, Channel One, will continue to carry the
country's principal news programs and remain an outlet for
government information and cultural programming. Its directors will
be Gorbachev, the Supreme Soviet legislature, and the national
government.
   The second company, to be called ``Commonwealth,'' will be
devoted to programming from studios in the 15 Soviet republics.
   A new Moscow TV Company, a joint-stock enterprise, will run the
third channel. The original stockholders will be Gosteleradio, the
Moscow City Council, the Moscow Regional Council and various public
organizations.
   The fourth company, called 21st Century TV, will take the
current educational channel as its base. Gosteleradio said writers'
and artists' unions and other public organizations have been
invited to become its founders.
   Leningrad TV, the only channel that has been independent of
Central Television, also is being invited to form a joint stock
company, Izvestia said.
   Gosteleradio said the changes would ``democratize the artistic
process, strengthen the spirit of competition and, as a result,
raise the quality of broadcasting.''
   Gosteleradio itself will be among the founders of all four new
companies, because it controls virtually all the equipment and
existing broadcast revenues, Izvestia said.
   In a presidential decree carried Wednesday by Tass, Gorbachev
gave Nenashev two weeks to submit proposals for reforming the
Committee on the Press.
   The decree says a major reorganization of the press is needed to
``ensure citizens' rights to receive and disseminate information,
broader rights for publishing houses and printing enterprises, and
delineation of the functions of central and localauthorities.''
   Earlier this year, the Supreme Soviet passed a new law on
freedom of the press, giving legal backbone to Gorbachev's policy
of glasnost, or greater openness.
   In the past year, several leading Soviet publications, including
the weekly newspaper Moscow News and the magazine Ogonyok, have
gained formal independence from ownership by government and
Communist organizations. But most newspapers and magazines still
belong to political bodies or state organizations.
   The reorganization of the press could pave the way for more
independent publications and privately owned, profit-making
publishing houses.

<HEAD>Thrift Bailout Regulators Seeking $6.8 Billion From Drexel</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Combines previous; ADDS details, EDITS throughout.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Federal savings and loan regulators Wednesday
filed claims for $6.8 billion against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
alleging the firm plundered more than 40 failed thrifts through
junk bond and other securities.
   The claims are by far the largest in the collapse of the
nation's savings and loans. They also, for the first time, place
much of the blame on Drexel, which managed most of the $15 billion
in junk bonds sold to thrifts.
   The filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court charges that the collapsed
Wall Street investment bank engaged in bribery, coercion,
extortion, fraud and other illegal activities that created huge
losses for the savings and loans.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust
Corp. also said they would seek recovery from two funds established
with $750 million from Drexel and its former junk-bond leader
Michael Milken. The money is meant to compensate investors in
frauds Drexel and Milken already have admitted.
   The two agencies claimed Drexel monopolized the $200 billion
high-yield debt securities market and maintained an appearance of
activity when none existed, disguising and delaying losses on the
thrifts' junk-bond portfolios.
   Among the thrifts listed in the FDIC and Resolution Trust claim
are major Drexel clients involved in civil lawsuits around the
country. They include Columbia Savings and Loan Association and
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association in California and CenTrust
Bank in Miami.
   Drexel, which sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection in
February, faces billions of dollars more in claims in more than 100
civil lawsuits filed by investors, shareholders and former clients.
   The FDIC and RTC claims are based on losses incurred by the
failed thrifts on investments in high-yield debt securities
underwritten or managed by Drexel. The junk bond market collapsed
about a year ago, devastating the value of these securities.
   The FDIC insures deposits for the nation's savings and loans.
Resolution Trust oversees the federal thrift bailout and has taken
over more than 100 failed savings and loans.
   Drexel said the claims reflect that the firm ``has become a
convenient scapegoat for the S&amp;L crisis as various agencies and
branches of the government attempt to deflect their own
responsibility at the expense of parties to the firm's bankruptcy
proceedings.''
   ``Regardless of the number of zeros in the claims of the
government ... Drexel intends to vigorously defend against them in
the bankruptcy proceedings,'' a statement said. ``In court the
conduct of regulators and others chiefly responsible for the S&amp;L
debacle will be the real issue.''
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC and Resolution Trust,
said in a statement that the Drexel investigation ``is among the
most extensive ever undertaken by federal banking agencies.''
   ``But we still have much more to do to ensure that we identify
and recover all the losses caused by Drexel,'' he said. ``The
American taxpayers, who are paying the bill for the S&amp;L bailout,
expect no less from us.''
   The government bailout is expected to cost taxpayers $500
billion over the next 30 years.
   Seidman said the two agencies are considering possible civil
claims against Drexel, Milken and other participants in the alleged
frauds by the firm.
   The agencies claimed Drexel made misrepresentations about the
sale of the bonds and gave payoffs to managers of some S&amp;Ls
involved in alleged illegal trading with Drexel.
   The agencies also said Drexel engaged in anti-competitive
practices and threatened stock manipulation against public
companies that did not retain Drexel as an investment banker.
   The FDIC and RTC said in a statement that the claims reflect
total junk bond losses to date of $2 billion. The alleged damages
were tripled under federal antitrust and racketeering laws, for a
total of $6 billion.
   The filing includes other claims totaling $800 million for
alleged illegal trading unrelated to junk bonds involving 15 failed
thrifts.
   Those include a $517 million fraud allegation in the sale of
government securities filed in Dallas federal court on behalf of
GuarantyFederal Savings and Loan of Dallas, the agencies said.
   The claims by far exceed Drexel's current assets of about $3
billion and $2.85 billion in liabilities. The assets do not reflect
the value of the firm's junk bond portfolio and stock investments
in Drexel-managed takeover deals.
   Claims on the restitution funds to be administered by the
Securities and Exchange Commission to compensate investors for
wrongdoing by Drexel and Milken would be in addition to the total
alleged damages.
   Milken must place $400 million into the fund after he is
sentenced for six felony counts to which he pleaded guilty in
April. Sentencing was scheduled for next week.
   Drexel pleaded guilty to six felony counts last year. It has
placed $200 million into the SEC fund, but $150 million has yet to
be paid and is tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings.
   Through their lawyers, Drexel and Milken have denied any role in
the collapse of the savings and loans. At a pre-sentencing hearing
for Milken, former Drexel employees did state that Drexel engaged
in illegal activity with at least one major thrift.

   An 8-year-old boy impaled on a
half-inch-thick steel rod was upgraded to serious condition
Wednesday, just two days after the thick spike punched through his
heart and destroyed one jugular vein in his neck.
   ``This is one in a billion,'' said Dr. Phillip Richemont, one of
three University Medical Center surgeons who spent almost 2{ hours
Monday extracting the section of steel rod from Justin Stiner's
chest and neck.
   The 4-foot-10, 86-pound third-grader fell off the roof of a
house in Sierra Vista while playing with a friend Monday. He fell
onto a 4-foot section of the threaded rod, similar to ``rebar''
used for reinforcing concrete, that was sticking out of the ground.
   Surgeons were stunned to find that although the rod had pierced
the heart in two places and divided the jugular vein, ``it didn't
bleed. It's amazing,'' Richemont said.
   The heart tissue seemingly ``contracted down between the
threads,'' cutting off bleeding, Richemont said.
   Justin hung on the rod about 2 feet off the ground for about 20
minutes, alert the whole time, before paramedics cut off a 2{-foot
piece of the rod without disturbing the 18-inch section that
penetrated his body.
   He was flown by helicopter about 80 miles to Tucson. Surgery did
not begin until about 3{ hours after the accident, said Dr. Michael
Esser, who operated on the boy.
   Paramedics said the boy was calm throughout the trip to the
hospital.
   ``What makes this so interesting is the amount of time it took
until he got to the hospital ... and yet he lived,'' Richemont
said.
   On arrival at Tucson, Justin ``wanted to know if I was going to
remove it. He was very cooperative,'' Richemont said.
   The rod was unscrewed from Justin's neck and body while the boy
was on a heart-bypass machine, Richemont said.
   The bar had pierced his body several inches above the navel and
just below the breastbone. It tore through the bottom of his
heart's right ventricle and exited the top of the chamber.
   His mother, Amanda Stiner, said Wednesday her son hasn't
comprehended yet the seriousness of his injuries. ``This morning is
the first time he found out he was cut open,'' she said.
   ``The doctors have told me how lucky he was. They said that it
was just a miracle that he lived.''
   She said he underwent testing Wednesday because of abdominal
pains, but later in the day he was moved from an intensive care
unit to the center's regular pediatric unit,a spokeswoman said.
Ms. Stiner, 31, said doctors told her Justin might be released
early next week, barring complications.
   Ms. Stiner described her son as ``a climber, always on trees, on
the roof,'' and said he told doctors Wednesday that ```It was like
falling in slow motion.'''
   She added that he told her ``he's not climbing on nothing'' in
the future.
   Esser and Richemont said the right side of the heart has about
one-third the blood pressure of the left side.
   ``He would have bled to death'' if it had been on the left side,
Esser said. ``He's one lucky kid. It just didn't hit any arterial
structures.''
   After leaving the heart, the rod missed the aorta and pulmonary
arteries, cut the thymus gland, tore the right interior jugular
vein in half and skimmed off the carotid artery but did not exit
his neck, said the doctors and hospital spokeswoman Peggy Rowley.
   The boy's severed jugular, which returns blood from the head to
the heart, was simply tied off, but that will pose no problems
because other veins would provide needed circulation, Esser said.
   Justin's condition was upgraded from critical to serious
Wednesday morning and he remained in intensive care, said Ms.
Rowley.
   When Justin awoke Tuesday he asked for two things: some ice to
soothe his throat since he wasn't allowed to eat or drink, and to
play Nintendo, Richemont said.
   ``He probably just thinks this is kind of a slight inconvenience
in his life,'' Esser said.

   Iraq on Wednesday accused the United States of looking for a
fight, but President Bush told congressional leaders he has no
immediate plans to go to war in the Persian Gulf.
   Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, said any Arab summit would fail unless
Iraq agreed in advance to withdraw from Kuwait. Morocco's King
Hassan had appealed last week for an emergency summit, saying it
might be the last chance for peace.
   The United States was putting pressure on Japan to do more for
the effort to drive Iraq out of Kuwait. Vice President Dan Quayle,
in Tokyo, thanked Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu for Japan's
financial support but suggested that a Japanese presence in the
gulf would demonstrate a far greater commitment.
   The State Department said two Americans were to leave Iraq on
Wednesday and Thursday. The department did not release their
identities or further details.
   Iraq has been releasing scores of Western hostages in recent
weeks, including some who have been held as human shields at
strategic installations to deter a possible attack.
   Bush's meeting with lawmakers came against a backdrop of growing
congressional concern about the scope of U.S. military involvement
in the gulf. The president announced last week that 200,000 new
U.S. troops would be sent to provide an ``offensive military
option'' for use against Iraq. That will nearly double U.S. troop
strength in the region, now at about 230,000.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said after talking with
Bush that the buildup ``is not in and of itself a decision to use
force, but rather is intended to create credible options.''
   Democratic leaders told Bush they believe the Constitution would
require him to seek congressional authorization before using
military force in the gulf. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
said Bush would ``follow the Constitution'' but added that there
was some question about its interpretation.
   The first of several hundred American M1A1 tanks rolled into
Saudi Arabia on Wednesday night to give U.S. forces a bigger edge
against the Iraqis. The M1A1 Abrams tanks, the Army's premiere
ground combat weapon, will replace M1 tanks in all front-line Army
units deployed in Saudi Arabia.
   Iraq has been assailing the U.S. buildup as proof of aggressive
intentions. On Wednesday, it did so again, denouncing plans for
amphibious assault exercises by U.S. Marines in Saudi Arabia.
   The Pentagon had disclosed the plans on Tuesday for the
maneuvers, the first such exercises staged in Saudi Arabia, but did
not say where or when they would take place. The Washington Times
reported they would be be held 10 miles from Kuwait.
   The Iraqi statement, carried by the official Iraqi News Agency
and quoting an unidentified government official, called the planned
maneuvers an ``intended provocation close to the Iraqi border.''
   Meanwhile, Iaq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, lobbied the
United Nations Security Council, seeking to block any move to use
force against Iraq. Aziz complained that the United States ``had
been planning since the very outset to attack Iraq.''
   A resolution on use of force could be vetoed by any of the
Security Council's five permanent members. Among them, France,
China and the Soviet Union have indicated they want to give the
economic sanctions and diplomacy more time.
   Britain, the other permanent member besides the United States,
is said to be building up its forces in the region. The Times of
London reported Wednesday that Britain was expected to send an
additional 6,000 troops to the gulf, increasing its ground forces
there to 15,500.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who is locked in a
parliamentary battle to keep her job, has made a series of strongly
worded demands in recent days that Iraq relinquish Kuwait. Those
comments drew scorn from Information Minister Latif Jassim.
   ``The beating of war drums by Thatcher reflects the acute
psychological condition she lives in ... while she is preparing to
leave the leadership of her party,'' the Iraqi news agency quoted
him as saying.
   In an effort to solidify support, Baker will meet Saturday in
Geneva with the foreign ministers of Ethiopia, Ivory Coast and
Zaire, which are all members of the U.N. Security Council. He hopes
to persuade them to support a resolution authorizing the use of
force to expel Iraq from Kuwait, officials said.
   There has also been a flurry of Arab diplomatic activity since
Morocco's call for an emergency Arab summit. But divisions appeared
to deepen on Wednesday.
   Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, arriving
in the United Arab Emirates, said the only way such a gathering
could succeed would be for Iraq to agree in advance to withdraw
from Kuwait, which it seized Aug. 2.
   ``Any Arab meetings will bear no fruit or results unless Iraq
announces it agrees to implement the resolutions of the emergency
Arab summit held in Cairo in August, and the international
resolutions that call for a pullout of Iraqi troops and the
restoration of Kuwaiti legitimacy,'' he said in a statement
distributed by the official Emirates news agency, WAM.
   Iraq made it clear any such promise was highly unlikely.
President Saddam Hussein's second-in-command, Taha Yassin Ramadan,
went to Morocco for talks and said on his return that any Arab
gathering should instead ``erase the infamous Cairo summit
resolutions.''
   Just after the invasion, 14 of the Arab League's 21 members
meeting in the Egyptian capital voted to condemn Iraq and demanded
a restoration of Kuwait's former government.
   In other high-level talks in the Arab world on Wednesday,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was in Syria, and Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Saadoun Hamadi met with Algeria's president. Two
Soviet envoys were also in the region.
   In other developments:
   -Bush notified Congress he was extending for an additional 90
days the call-up for reservists already serving 90-day stints in
the gulf region. The move had been expected.
   -Former Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega became the latest
out-of-power leader to try his hand at peacemaking in the gulf,
arriving in Baghdad on Wednesday. Ortega, whose leftist Sandinista
administration waged a long war with U.S.-backed Contra rebels,
told reporters during a stopover in Amman, Jordan, that ``we must
never subordinate international law to the particular interests of
a superpower.''

   A hazing that killed an 18-year-old student
has resulted in the expulsion or suspension of 12 students at
Western Illinois University, school officials said Wednesday.
   Freshman Nicholas Haben was found dead of alcohol poisoning in a
dorm room the morning after his initiation in October into the
university's lacrosse team.
   A spokeswoman for the school, Debra Miller, would not provide a
breakdown of how many of the 12 students would be suspended and how
many would be expelled.
   ``It has to do with privacy,'' she said.
   Those who are suspended must take part in alcohol education
programs once they return to the university, the school said.
   The 12 upperclassmen face misdemeanor charges.
   The school's lacrosse club has been suspended while the
investigation continues, the university said.
   Haben's teammates have said they carried him to his dorm room
just after midnight on the night of his initiation.
   An autopsy revealed Haben's blood alcohol level was .34, said
Robert Strodel, an attorney representing Haben's parents, Dale and
Alice Haben. A motorist in Illinois is considered legally drunk
with a reading of .10.

   A former elementary school teacher accused
of molesting dozens of his male students over 30 years, some of
them sons of formerly abused boys, was sentenced Wednesday to 20
years in prison.
   Douglas Marks, 63, also was fined $25,000.
   Marks had no visible reaction when the sentence was announced by
state District Judge Frank Davis and he was led from the courtroom
in handcuffs. About 40 people showed up at the sentencing,
including Marks' brother, Bob, former speaker of the Montana House.
   Marks pleaded guilty July 9 to four counts of felony sexual
assault for molesting four of his elementary school students
between 1985 and 1989. The fathers of two of those boys said they,
too, had been victims of Marks years ago.
   Prosecutors said Marks molested many other male students during
his lengthy teaching career in Boulder and nearby Clancy.
   Court records cited 22 instances of molestation dating to 1956,
most too old to prosecute. Jefferson County Attorney Richard
Llewellyn says he has found 45 victims.
   Paul Myrhow, whose complaint against Marks led to the
investigation that resulted in the charges and who took his
complaints public, was in the courtroom.
   ``It was more than I expected,'' he said. ``I thought he was
going to get away with no prison time.''
   Davis sentenced Marks to a 40-year term but suspended 20 years.
Davis also said if Marks is paroled, he can have no contact with
anyone younger than 18 years old.
   At a hearing last week, Davis refused to allow some of Marks'
victims to testify, saying ``I wasn't going to embarrass this poor
man any more.''
   Marks should be eligible for parole in about five years,
Llewellyn said. Davis said Marks could not be paroled until he paid
the $25,000 fine, which would be used to pay for counseling of his
victims and other youths involved in sex crimes.
   Marks is a member of a prominent local family that owns
substantial ranch property in the Helena-Boulder area and a sawmill
in Clancy.
   Llewellyn said he was satisfied with the sentence, adding that
Marks had shown little remorse for the victims.
   Defense lawyer Richard Gillespie had asked that Marks be
sentenced to a treatment program and 238 days in jail, most of
which would have been served on weekends.
   Llewellyn took issue with suggestions by some that investigators
acted too slowly in bringing Marks to justice. He said the state
acted as quickly as it could, interviewing dozens of witnesses in
several states.
   Marks had built a reputation as a devoted and selfless teacher
in Boulder, but questions about his morals were raised as early as
1959.
   He was forced to resign from Jefferson County High School that
year after three boys said he molested them, but he later taught at
nearby Clancy and then returned to Boulder in 1965 as an elementary
school teacher.
   In a related development Tuesday, Boulder school officials said
an independent investigation had shown that five people had
reported ``improper conduct'' by Marks to school officials.
   The school board hired two investigators in September to look
into allegations that school officals were slow to act on
complaints about Marks. The investigators reported their findings
to a board committee at a closed meeting Monday.
   Superintendent of Schools Richard Moe said the board's conduct
committee is reviewing information and giving anyone who allegedly
acted improperly a chance to respond. He would not elaborate.

   France tested a nuclear weapon Wednesday in the
South Pacific and publicly announced the explosion in keeping with
a new policy. New Zealand quickly condemned the test.
   The French Defense Ministry said a device with explosive power
below 100 kilotons was detonated at Fangataufa in French Polynesia.
One kiloton has the explosive force of 1,000 tons of TNT.
   Over the previous 15 years, France had refused to comment on its
nuclear tests in the South Pacific. Word of such tests came from an
observation station operated by New Zealand in the Cook Islands.
   In May, President Francois Mitterrand announced during a trip to
the South Pacific that France would begin announcing the tests,
which many countries in the region oppose. French officials also
said the number of tests would be reduced from eight to six
annually.
   Wednesday's test was the fifth under the new disclosure policy.
   In Wellington, New Zealand, Deputy Prime Minister Don McKinnon
on Thursday denounced the test.
   ``I want to make it clear the ... government opposes nuclear
testing in our region,'' he said. His statement added that ``it is
all the more disappointing when a country which we regard as a
friend continues to ignore the concerns of New Zealanders and of
all the people in the South Pacific.''

   The reputations and careers of five U.S.
senators are at stake as the Senate Ethics Committee begins public
hearings Thursday into their actions on behalf of high-flying
savings-and-loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr.
   The televised hearings will offer a dramatic glimpse into the
roles of the ``Keating Five'' in one of the nation's biggest
financial debacles, the collapse of Keating's Lincoln Savings and
Loan in a failure that may cost taxpayers $2 billion.
   The hearings are, in effect, a trial for Republican Sen. John
McCain of Arizona and Democrats John Glenn of Ohio, Donald W.
Riegle Jr. of Michigan, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Alan
Cranston of California.
   Each of the five denies any wrongdoing.
   Their involvement has become a symbol of the larger S&amp;L industry
collapse, and the outcome of the proceedings could intensify
political ramifications of what so far has been a bipartisan
scandal.
   ``It's not just the five senators, but the whole Senate whose
integrity and credibility is on the line,'' said Fred Wertheimer,
head Common Cause, whose complaint last year began the committee's
proceedings.
   Individual political futures are on the line for all but
Cranston.
   He said last week that he has prostate cancer and won't seek
re-election in 1992. He also gave up his position as whip, the No.
2 Democratic Senate leadership post.
   Each of the five intervened with federal banking regulators on
behalf of Keating's Irvine, Calif.-based thrift before it was
seized by the government in April 1989.
   Each also received money, totaling $1.3 million, in campaign
contributions or donations to favored causes from Keating and his
associates. Each denies any connection between eating's money and
intervention with regulators.
   The basic issue is whether any of the Keating Five violated
Senate rules against exerting improper influence in return for
compensation.
   The question has enormous ramifications for the three Democrats
and three Republicans who sit in judgment on the ethics panel - and
for the Senate itself.
   Members of Congress routinely intervene with the federal
government for constituents, contributors and friends. Where the
line of impropriety falls is an uncomfortable issue for Congress.
   Technically, the initial question is more narrow. The committee
scrutiny is still in its preliminary stage, and the panel is to
decide whether investigations should be advanced or terminated for
any of the five.
   The committee ultimately could vote to rebuke any of the five or
recommend to the full Senate a more serious punishment, such as
censure or expulsion.
   On Wednesday, Cranston released a letter to the committee saying
that one of its members, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., made remarks in
his recent re-election campaign that reveal ``an absence of
impartiality.''
   Cranston's attorney, William Taylor, said Helms criticized his
opponent for receiving $5,000 from Cranston's political action
committee. Taylor also cited news accounts quoting Helms as calling
Cranston ``the leading water carrier'' for Keating.
   A receptionist at Helms' office said neither Helms nor his press
spokesman was available to respond. Cranston will make an opening
statement before the panel, but will not testify because he is
undergoing radiation therapy.
   The ethics panel is chaired by Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala. The
chief counsel is Robert S. Bennett, a prominent Washington lawyer.
   Bennett will present evidence. Lawyers for each of the five will
cross-examine witnesses and present their own cases. Committee
members will question them as well.
   Despite the trial-like qualities, Bennett - who declined to
discuss his evidence - said he won't function as a prosecutor.
   ``What is important in this proceeding is that there be a full
disclosure of the facts, that justice be done to each of the five
senators - and we are dealing with five separate cases,'' he said.
``I as special counsel am here to assist the committee in reaching
the right result and explain to the public what occurred and what
did not occur.''
   It was unlikely Keating would be called to testify,
congressional sources said. He has not been granted immunity and
it's expected he would refuse to testify, citing constitutional
rights against self-incrimination as he did before the House
Banking Committee last year.
   The hearings are scheduled to run the rest of this week and
first two days of next week. Heflin has said they may take 10 days,
but the abundance of lawyers and open-ended time for questioning
may make it run much longer.
   The committee has denied requests by Glenn and McCain for
separate hearings.
   To get to this stage, the ethics committee apparently ignored
its chief counsel's private recommendation that proceedings be
dropped against McCain and Glenn.
   Its decision to proceed with hearings on all five postponed the
issue beyond last week's election. That kept the bipartisan Keating
Five from becoming a Democrats-only group of three - and thus
avoided handing Republicans a potent partisan cudgel.
   Republican McCain denounced the delay as political cowardice.
   His top aide, Chris Koch, said McCain ended his friendship with
Keating on March 24, 1987, when Keating asked the senator to
negotiate with regulators on his behalf.
   ``John refused to do it for him,'' Koch said.
   The scandal already has taken an enormous political toll on each
of the five.
   Voter exit polling in the senators' states last week found 40
percent thought Cranston should resign immediately. In Ohio, 39
percent thought Glenn should not run again when his term expires in
1992, and 18 percent thought he should resign.
   DeConcini wrote to some 5,000 supporters this week.
   ``You may hear derogatory statements about me and my office, but
I can assure you that I have not betrayed my public trust, nor do I
intend to be intimidated from assisting constituents in their
dealings with our government,'' DeConcini wrote.
   Riegle, who's not up for re-election until 1994, is chairman of
the Senate Banking Committee.
   ``There's no smoking gun on Don Riegle,'' said his lawyer,
Thomas Green.
   Glenn, the first American astronaut to orbit the Earth, has
called the Keating affair ``the worst thing I've ever been
through.'' He said he attended the meetings only to determine if
Lincoln was being treated fairly.
   The cable network C-SPAN will televise the hearings.

   Most Americans are opposed to the United
States going to war with Iraq even if the standoff in the Persian
Gulf has not changed by the beginning of next year, according to a
poll sponsored by an arms-control group.
   The poll released Wednesday also found that most Americans
approve of President Bush's handling of Iraq's takeover of Kuwait.
   The survey was conducted by ICR Survey Research Group of Media,
Pa., and was commissioned and paid for by The Professionals'
Coalition for Nuclear Arms Control.
   The national telephone survey of 1,020 Americans found that 44
percent favor continuing the economic sanctions if the situation
remains unresolved by January or February.
   Fourteen percent who were questioned Friday through Tuesday
favor withdrawing U.S. troops from Saudi Arabia if the stalemate
continues.
   Thirty-eight percent of those polled believe the United States
should start a war against Iraq, including 8 percent who believe
the country should act without approval from U.S. allies or the
United Nations.
   Four percent were undecided.
   The survey reported a likely margin of uncertainty of 3
percentage points either way.
   Among those polled, 62 percent favored President Bush's handling
of the situation while 29 percent disapproved and 9 percent were
undecided.
   The survey found that 71 percent believe Congress must approve
sending U.S. troops into battle with Iraqi forces while 26 percent
think the president is able to act alone.
   Fifty-six percent of those surveyed believe the United States
and its allies should make every attempt to negotiate with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, while 39 percent said there should be no
negotiations.

   An Oregon State University official
escaped from Kuwait after spending 110 days in hiding following the
Iraqi invasion, a university official said.
   Ernest Briskey, the school's assistant vice president for
international program development, had been a senior adviser to the
Kuwaiti Institute of Scientific Research.
   He went into hiding after the Aug. 2 invasion and was sheltered
by friends, Bob Bruce, assistant vice president for university
relations, said Tuesday.
   Briskey's wife, Marge, received a telephone call Tuesday from
the State Department notifying her that her husband had escaped
from Kuwait to Amman, Jordan, Bruce said.
   Briskey was never captured or held hostage by Iraqi officials,
Bruce said.
   Bruce said he had no details on how Briskey was hidden or when
or how he made his escape. Briskey contacted U.S. officials after
reaching Jordan.
   Briskey told his wife by telephone that he hoped to be back in
the United States by Friday, but there could be delays, Bruce said.

   Hunters fled for their lives and the
governor Wednesday called out the National Guard as a wind-whipped
wildfire blackened at least 34,000 acres of timber and grassland
near the Missouri River.
   After Gov. Stan Stephens issued his call, 40 guardsmen and extra
equipment joined 400 firefighters battling the blaze. Other
firefighters were brought in from Indian reservations and a prison.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation. Authorities
believed it started Tuesday night in a hunting camp in the Big Belt
Mountains, about 35 miles northeast of Helena.
   No injuries were reported, but authorities worried that deer and
elk hunters could still be trapped at remote campsites.
   By early evening, Lewis and Clark County Sheriff Chuck O'Reilly
said searchers in aircraft found no sign of trapped hunters. There
were no reports of anyone missing.
   ``Everybody we know of up there is accounted for,'' O'Reilly
said.
   About two dozen hunters fled their backcountry camps late
Tuesday when the fire raged through the remote Gates of the
Mountains Wilderness and adjacent Beartooth Game Range.
   Butch Hestekin said a wall of flames seven miles wide ``just
whipped across the tops of the trees'' at his camp. Hestekin's
hunting party abandoned five pickup trucks and their belongings in
their rush to flee.
   ``The cinders were falling on us,'' said hunter Lynn Dumas. ``We
had five minutes' warning - just about enough time to saddle a
horse.''
   Bob Michaelson said he saw flames destroy four pickup trucks and
four camping vehicles. Hunters freed their extra horses while the
heat caused ammunition to explode and the chrome on vehicles to
melt.
   About 180 miles northeast of the Missouri River blaze, fire
authorities reported containment of a separate 33,000-acre grass
and timber fire on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation.
   ``I guess the key factor is what the winds do to us today,''
said Jim Greene, a commander at the Lodgepole fire.
   That blaze had burned at least one mobile home, several barns
and had killed a cow, fire officials said. No injuries were
reported. The fire's cause was under investigation.
   No other structures were damaged Missouri River fire, but at
least 30 homes were evacuated east of Wolf Creek and the flames
came within about two miles of the small town of Craig, which the
river protects.
   About 10 to 15 hunters jumped into Elkhorn Creek on Tuesday
night as the fire passed over them, said Lorraine Parrish, a
spokeswoman at the Interagency Dispatch Center near Helena.
   Record-high temperatures, extremely dry conditions for
mid-November and winds up to 30 mph helped the blaze spread, said
fire officials.
   ``People who that have been around fires for 30 years have told
me this is the most unusual thing they have ever seen,'' said
Dennis Casey, commissioner of state lands.

   Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney on Wednesday
authorized the military services to call up 72,500 more reservists
and National Guard members because of the situation in the Persian
Gulf.
   His action brings to 125,000 the number of Army, Navy, Air Force
and Marine Corps reservists who can be on active duty. The limit
had been 48,800 before Friday and 52,500 before Wednesday's
announcement.
   His action had been expected in the wake of President Bush's
decision last week to order an additional 200,000 troops to the
gulf region, in addition to the approximately 230,000 already
there.
   The president said the expansion was necessary to enable the
United States to go on the offensive.
   The administration had previously said that the mission of the
troops, sent to Saudi Arabia after Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait
on Aug. 2, was defensive.
   Cheney's action raises the call-up ceilings from 25,000 to
80,000 for the Army, from 14,500 to 20,000 for the Air Force and
from 3,000 to 15,000 for the Marine Corps.
   Last Friday, the ceiling for naval reservists was raised from
6,300 to 10,000.
   Cheney also extended to the Army the authority, previously
granted to the other services, to call reserve combat units to duty
if needed. The earlier orders had limited the Army to support
units.
   Combat units may be ordered to undergo refresher training before
they are sent overseas, the Pentagon said.
   ``Today's armed forces are designed with combat support and
combat service support built into the reserves,'' Cheney said. ``As
we increase the deployment of active duty forces, we must also call
upon more members of the National Guard and Reserve to get the
supporting forces we need,'' Cheney said.
   Earlier Wednesday, Bush extended the tour of active duty for the
reservists from 90 to 180 days. The original order in August had
specified 90 days, subject to an additional 90 by presidential
action.
   Congress has passed legislation permitting combat reserves to be
called up for an additional 180 days by presidential action, but
Cheney said the Defense Department has not yet asked the president
for such authority.
   Since Cheney's original order on Aug. 23, there have been 35,562
reservists called to active duty. They include 24,524 in the Army,
4,616 in the Navy, 5,278 in the Air Force and 1,144 by the Marine
Corps. In addition, the Coast Guard has called up 511.
   Also on Wednesday, the Navy announced it was activating 17
medical, public affairs and construction units of the Naval Reserve
in 13 states.
   That announcement said 62 reservists are being called to active
duty from the 17 units. The activation of a reserve unit may not
involve the entire unit, the Navy said.
   The units, with their missions, are:
   4th Light Armored Vehicle Company A, Santa Ana, Calif., medical
support for Marine Corp.
   4th Medical Detachment, 4th Tank Battalion, San Diego, Calif.,
medical support for Marine Corps.
   4th Marine Air Wing, Medical Marine Air Group 46, San Diego,
medical support for the Marine Corps.
   4th Medical Detachment, 3rd Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company,
Long Beach, Calif., medical support for the Marine Corps.
   Office of Information Detachment 1118, Aurora, Colo., public
affairs support.
   4th Marine Air Wing, Medical Marine Air Group 41, Marietta, Ga.,
medical support for the Marine Corps.
   4th Medical Detachment, 4th Combat Engineering Battalion,
Baltimore, medical support for the Marine Corps.
   1st Reserve Naval Construction Brigade, Gulfport, Miss.,

   The prime minister of Luxembourg told
parliament Wednesday that NATO organized a network of clandestine
resistance fighters at the start of the Cold War.
   ``NATO was the initiator and the coordinator (but) each member
nation was master of its own operation,'' Prime Minister Jacque
Santer said, adding that virtually all the European nations in NATO
took part. He said the network was recently disbanded in
Luxembourg.
   NATO officials have refused to comment on the alliance's role in
the network of guerrilla groups organized as part of preparations
for a possible Soviet attack.
   ``NATO does not comment on matters of security,'' said a
spokesman at NATO headquarters.
   Former NATO Secretary General Joseph Luns said he had never
heard of the guerrilla network, but acknowledged it could have
operated behind his back.
   The government of Luxembourg said it participated in an allied
network of guerrilla operatives.
   ``The very principle of such a concept of patriotic resistance
cannot be disputed in the strategic context at that time,'' the
government said, referring to the start of the Cold War.
   The guerrilla network was brought to light last month in Italy,
where it takes its name - Operation Gladio - from the swords used
by Roman gladiators. In Italy, Gladio is under investigation for
possible links to right-wing terrorism. A similar inquiry is under
way in Belgium.
   The existence of the resistance networks has been disclosed in
Italy, Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway,
Austria, Spain, Greece and Portugal. The guerrilla groups became
public knowledge years ago in Norway and Turkey, but debate in
those countries drew little notice elsewhere.
   On Wednesday, Guy Coeme, Belgium's defense minister,
acknowledged the existence of a Belgian network, code-named ``Stay
Behind.''
   He said it was in touch with similar groups in other NATO
nations through a coordination committee that most recently met in
Brussels in October. But Coeme said he could not ``say now what
links (the Belgian network) had with NATO.''
   In Bonn, the German government confirmed plans for covert
anti-Communist actions in case of war, but denied any military unit
took part.
   ``Reports that link the precautions mentioned with expressions
like commando group or guerrilla army are false,'' government
spokesman Hans Klein said, without elaboration.
   The German newspaper Die Welt reported Wednesday that U.S.
intelligence agents recruited hundreds of guerrillas and laid
weapons caches across Western Europe at the start of the Cold War.
   Jean Gol, a former Belgian justice minister, was quoted
Wednesday as saying the government knew of a secret anti-Communist
network in Belgium.
   ``Shortly after I became minister of justice on Jan. 16, 1984
... I was informed about'' the Belgian network, Gol told the daily
newspaper Le Peuple. He said Belgium's 1984 budget contained
$328,000 to modernize the network's communication equipment.
   In Turkey, the independent daily Milliyet said a unit known as
the Special War Department within the general staff was most likely
the Turkish branch of Operation Gladio.
   It quoted former Premier Bulent Ecevit as saying the unit had
been funded by the United States until 1974. After that, he said,
the unit sought funds from the defense budget.
   ``Patriotic volunteers were members of the group. They were
trained specially to launch a counter guerrilla operation in the
event that the country was occupied,'' Ecevit was quoted as saying.
   Existence of the Turkish group was well known and often became
the focus of debate in political circles and newspapers. During a
wave of terrorism in 1970s, leftist groups questioned the possible
role of the organization in right-wing terrorism.
   British intelligence expert Nigel West said Wednesday that U.S.
and British agents were ``heavily involved'' in creating European
resistance networks.
   In a telephone interview in London, West, editor of Intelligence
Quarterly magazine, said such networks were often continuations of
plans first created in World War II.
   Initially, they arose out of Allied desire not to repeat wartime
mistakes, when German advances caught Allies without plans for
``stay-behind'' fighters, said West - pen name of Conservative
lawmaker Rupert Allason, author of books on Britain's MI5 and MI6
security services.
   He said such operations in Britain were disbanded because a
Soviet invasion of Britain ``has never been regarded as a tactical
practicality.''
   But he added that ``curiously enough they still find caches of
arms in funny places.''

   The spurned Indian candidate for U.N. High
Commissioner of Refugees on Wednesday slammed Western nations that
opposed him as racists who feel the commissioner has to ``carry the
burden of the white man.''
   Virendra Dayal, chief of staff to Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar, ran into a wall of opposition from the United States
and other Western nations when the U.N. chief circulated his name
last week.
   Dayal withdrew from consideration on Tuesday.
   Western and Third World countries want a strong, independent new
high commissioner who can appeal for more funds and public support
for refugees.
   ``There are some people in some capitals ... who are more
comfortable with second-level politicians from the First World
rather than first-rate international civil servants from the Third
World,'' Dayal told reporters.
   ``I've been stabbed in a dark alley by assassins who have not
disclosed who they are. You're darned right I'm bitter; I'm also
angry.''
   Dayal said claims by some governments, including the State
Department, they were been consulted were untrue.
   Dayal blamed racism.
   ``It is a feeling that a Western European has to carry the
burden of the white man. ... It's not personal; it's just that some
jobs are not meant to be taken by a non-European, it's as simple as
that,'' Dayal said.
   Among those who emerged as alternatives are candidates from
Norway, Austria, Canada, France, Japan and Britain.
   Dayal accused outgoing commissioner Thorvald Stoltenberg of
Norway of lobbying on behalf of Norway's former U.N. ambassador,
Tom Vraalsen.
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, who serves a three-year
term, is traditionally a Western European or someone backed by
Europeans and Americans. The office is responsible for protecting
15 million refugees.

<HEAD>Panamanian Government Cites New Tapes in Fund Fight With Noriega</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Panamanian government cited a set of newly
discovered taped telephone calls by Manuel Noriega when it asked a
federal judge Wednesday to prohibit the ousted dictator from
transferring any of his funds.
   Attorneys for the new Panamanian government said one of the
audio tapes obtained and broadcast by Cable News Network last week
indicates Noriega tried to move millions of dollars around the
world from his prison cell.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Davis, who is overseeing Panama's
civil lawsuit against Noriega, did not immedidately rule on the
request by Panama's attorneys for a temporary restraining order.
   The new Panamanian government has filed a $6.3 billion lawsuit
against Noriega alleging he looted its treasury before U.S. troops
deposed him in December 1989. The Panamania government estimates
Noriega's personal fortune, including property, is $300 million.
About $20 million in Noriega bank accounts has been frozen in the
United States and several other countries, U.S. officials said.
   Davis said U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, who is
overseeing a separate criminal case against Noriega, told him
earlier Wednesday there were no funds available to Noriega.
   Washington-based attorney John Kester, representing the
Panamanian government, argued any Noriega oney that surfaced,
except what was necessary to pay for his criminal defense, should
be frozen.
   ``From the tapes, we believe that he's making hundreds of
telephone calls, apparently moving funds - he's not just talking to
his lawyers,'' Kester told Davis. ``For all we know, he's on the
phone right now moving money around.''
   Noriega's attorney in the civil case, Stephen Zukoff, said the
court had no right to act because the violations alleged in the
lawsuit all took place in Panama, not the United States. He also
said Noriega could not be sued under the Geneva Convention.
   ``This court does not have jurisdiction,'' Zukoff said.
``General Noriega was brought here as a prisoner of war and is
entitled to certain rights ... he does have certain immunity.''
   Davis asked both sides to attempt a compromise on the money
issue and set another hearing for Nov. 27.
   Noriega is being held on drug-trafficking charges at the
Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he apparently made the
telephone calls that were recorded and later broadcast by CNN.

   The struggle for control of the Southern Baptist Convention
moved to the states this week as moderates and conservatives vied
for leadership and grappled with mission spending and control of
colleges.
   Moderate members of the nation's largest Protestant denomination
appeared Wednesday to continue their historic domination of state
conventions. Fundamentalists hold sway at the national level.
   Moderates have contended in recent years they have been stripped
of a voice because the conservative-controlled national convention
decides which missions, seminaries and other programs get SBC
funds.
   By maintaining control at the state level, moderates say they
are able to have at least some pull in how funds are spent, even
though the state and national conventions operate autonomously.
   ``Conservatives have taken over the national convention because
of the deceit that says there is liberalism among moderates ...,''
said the Rev. Bill Sherman, pastor of Nashville's Woodmont Baptist
Church and a moderate leader.
   ``But when you come down to the state level, no one can hang a
liberal label on a pastor because other Baptists know him and have
heard him preach,'' Sherman said.
   However, the Rev. Charles Sullivan, a conservative national
Executive Committee chairman, said fundamentalists don't have
absolute control at the state level because most have full-time
jobs, along with their church duties, and can't attend both state
and national conventions.
   Conservative Baptists over the past 12 years have taken control
of the 14.9 million-member denomination's national executive
committee and presidency. Moderates already were strong in most
state conventions.
   Fundamentalists, or conservatives, insist the scriptures be
interpreted literally, while moderates believe portions of the
Bible are written figuratively.
   State representatives this week chose moderate presidents over
conservative candidates in Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia and North
Carolina.
   Both moderates and fundamentalists claimed victory when North
Carolina Baptists approved a resolution that gives individual
churches the options of saying how the national convention spends
their money.
   Fundamentalists claimed other victories.
   In South Carolina, where moderates have held sway for years,
state representatives elected a fundamentalist president Wednesday.
   Florida, Oklahoma and West Virginia also elected
conservative-backed presidents, while officers in New Mexico and
other states proclaimed neutrality.
   Also in Oklahoma, resolutions were adopted calling for tighter
state restrictons on abortion and to keep strong control over
Oklahoma Baptist University, fearing it may try to break from
conservative control.
   In other action in Texas and South Carolina, representatives
debated actions by Baylor University and Furman University trustees
to take control over their own boards of trustees.
   State organizations previously had chosen trustees for both
colleges, but school administrators said they feared a takeover by
conservatives and gave trustees authority to elect their
replacements.
   Texas baptists on Wednesday agreed to place in escrow the state
organization's $6.8 million allocation to Baylor for 1991 until the
issue is resolved.

   The Pentagon has ordered moe than 7,500
employees trimmed from seven Air Force Logistics Command bases,
including more than 1,400 from Utah's Hill Air Force Base, a
congressman said Wednesday.
   Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, confirmed his office was notified
that 1,427 Hill workers would be among those targeted in a
nationwide reduction.
   A letter Hansen received from the Department of the Air Force
showed of the seven bases, Hill had the second-largest number of
layoffs. The hardest hit was Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma,
which was ordered to trim 2,196 employees.
   ``We're trying to see what remedies are available and if there
are possibilities of appeals,'' said Rep. Dave McCurdy, an Oklahoma
Democrat whose district includes the base and also got a letter on
the cutbacks.
   Kelly Air Force Base in Texas must get rid of 1,213 workers;
Robins in Georgia, 907; McClellan in California, 811; Newark in
Ohio, 709, and Wright-Patterson, also in Ohio, 240, Hansen said.
   ``Some cuts are inevitable,'' McCurdy said. ``The defense budget
is declining. When you lose $180 billion over five years, there are
going to be some reductions.''
   Hansen said changing international politics also made the
cutbacks inevitable.
   The reduction would affect about 5 percent of Hill's work force,
Hansen said it was not ``real dire news'' for Utah's defense
industry.
   ``A lot of these will be handled by attrition'' and the
likelihood of legislation to allow for ``early out'' retirements is
high, Hansen said.
   The reduction was ordered for 1991, but Hansen said that didn't
mean workers would be forced out in January.
   ``They're going to give the people some lead time ... I'm
looking at March or April,'' he said.
   In a prepared statement, Hill officials said no specific date
had been decided for the reductions.
   The statement said Gen. Charles C. McDonald, commander of Air
Force logistics, requested in September the congressional authority
to implement an early retirement program.
   ``The prospect for a greatly reduced logistics workload in the
years ahead is the main factor driving AFLC toward a smaller work
force,'' said the statement.
   ``As forces are reduced, there will be fewer aircraft and
missiles in the Air Force inventory, thus reducing the workloads at
AFLC maintainance and repair depots and other specialized
centers,'' it said.

<HEAD>New ID Cards Will Not List Ethnic Origins: President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda,
where tribal differences have often resulted in widespread
massacres, has ordered the issuance of new national identity cards
that do not list the holder's ethnic origins.
   He also has asked Rwandans to submit their views on possible
political reforms, including moving to a multiparty system, to a
commission preparing a new national political charter to be voted
on next year.
   Habyarimana, whose government currently is battling
predominantly Tutsi rebels, made the announcement in a wide-ranging
address Tuesday to parliamentarians, diplomats and dignitaries at
Rwanda's National Assembly.
   His comments were reported by state Rwandan radio, which was
monitored in Nairobi. A monitor copy was made available Wednesday
to The Associated Press.
   In an apparent reference to the fighting, Habyarimana said he
had decided the current ID cards be replaced to ensure ``maximum
security,'' apparently by dropping listing of ethnic origin.
   ``The introduction of the new cards ... also will facilitate the
exclusion of the mention of ethnic origin,'' he said.
   The issue is a sensitive one in Rwanda where bloody power
struggles have resulted in brutal ethnic retaliation. In the late
1950s, hundreds of thousands of the minority Tutsi fled the country
after the Hutu seized control and killed thousands of their former
feudal rulers.
   On Sept. 30, Tutsi exiles living in Uganda invaded Rwanda
seeking to overthrow Habyarimana's government, which they accuse of
corruption. Habyarimana claims to have defeated the rebels, but
sporadic clashes continue to be reported from the border areas.
   Meanwhile, preliminary talks have begun in Goma, Zaire, between
a delegation from the rebel Rwandese Patriotic Front and army
officers from neighboring countries who have been chosen to monitor
a ceasefire agreed to last month but as yet unobserved, the
state-run Rwandan radio said Wednesday.
   Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko is mediating in the conflict.
Delegates to the meeting, which started Tuesday, were to discuss
the agenda and adopt working procedures, according to the broadcast
monitored in Nairobi.
   In his address Tuesday, Habyarimana also called on Rwandans to
assist a commission that is looking into reforms, including
political pluralism.
   The former Belgian colony has been a single-party government
since 1978. The 30-member political reform commission, which has
been meeting since September, will produce a draft of a new
political charter at the end of December that will be open to
popular debate until March, said Habyarimana.

<HEAD>Largest Gem Ever Sold Fetches Record $12.8 Million</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 102-carat diamond, the largest gem of its kind
ever sold, fetched a record $12.8 million at an auction late
Wednesday.
   Sotheby's auctioneers identified the buyer of the ``internally
flawless'' diamond as Robert Mouawad, a Lebanese jeweler based in
Geneva.
   Sotheby's had forecast the pear-shaped, 1.4-inch-long diamond
would sell for $13 million.
   The previous record was set by an 86-carat diamond that fetched
$9.1 million at a New York auction in 1988.
   The auction was seen as a test of the reaction of the jewelry
market to recession fears and the Persian Gulf crisis. Amid lively
bidding, the day-long sale fetched a total $31 million.
   ``I was afraid the climate of the moment would affect the
price,'' said David Bennett, European Sales Director. ``But it was
a very, very good sale.''
   Sotheby's said the diamond of ``exceptional fire, brilliance and
purity,'' was only recently cut from a 222-carat rough diamond
found ``somewhere in black Africa.'' The cutting process took seven
weeks.
   The auction house said the diamond was graded D color. This is
the highest possible classification and means the total absence of
color. It said there were ``only a handful of stones'' of such
quality over 100 carats.
   Sotheby's declined to reveal the seller but ruled out De Beers,
the South African mining corporation with a large holding company
in Switzerland.
   The auctioneers said the buyer would be responsible for naming
the gem.
   It is only seven carats smaller than the world famous Koh-I-Nor,
which is kept in the Tower of London as part of the British crown
jewels.
   It weighs more than half as much as the 200-carat ``Orloff'' of
Russian Empress Catharine the Great kept in the Soviet diamond
treasury.
   Twenty-one years ago, a 69-carat stone was sold to Richard
Burton for Elizabeth Taylor at a comparatively cheap $1.2 million.

   A man who stopped eating after his
arrest during an anti-abortion protest was released Wednesday night
from a hospital without undergoing force feedings that had been
authorized by a judge.
   William Hamilton was released from Westchester County Medical
Center a day after a judge told doctors they could insert a feeding
tube because the fast was endangering his life.
   Hamilton, 25, of Trenton, N.J., had recently begun taking
limited fluids but lost about 42 pounds and was becoming weaker and
paler each day, hospital authorities said.
   County officials could not be reached for comment late
Wednesday.
   Hamilton had said he would not take his own life because that
would contradict the teachings of God.
   Hamilton was one of about 40 people arrested on charges of
criminal trespassing and obstructing governmental administration
during a Sept. 28 protest at the Women's Medical Pavilion in Dobbs
Ferry.
   The clinic, which performs abortions, has been a regular target
of protests by Operation Rescue and Operation Goliath, national
anti-abortion groups.
   Hamilton was transferred from jail to the medical center's
prison ward Oct. 23.

   The son of Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan was arrested and jailed Wednesday evening on a rape charge.
   Robert Jeffery Lujan was questioned at his parents' Alexandria
home and then arrested, said Steve Goldstein, chief spokesman for
the Interior Department.
   ``Their son has told them that it (the sex) was consensual,''
Goldstein said. ``Mr. Lujan has determined that he will not
interfere with the due process of the law. He hasn't even been down
to the jail this evening becuase he does not want to give any sense
of impropriety.''
   Goldstein confirmed local television reports that the
unidentified victim told police the attack occurred about 4:30 a.m.
Sunday after she awoke to find a man burglarizing her home in
Alexandria. She said the man forced her into having sex.
   Alexandria police declined to discuss the case immediately.
   Lujan had been living at his parents home, Goldstein said. The
spokesman said the younger Lujan was in his mid-20s, but he did not
have his precise age.
   His parents ``are quite concerned,'' he said. ``It's difficult
because he's secretary of the interior, but he's still a parent.''
   Lujan planned to return to his office Thursday, Goldstein said.
   ``It's a personal matter, and the secretary plans to go on with
business as usual,'' the spokesman said.

   Challenged by congressional leaders over its new
war footing, the Bush administration has begun to emphasize that
American jobs could be at risk if Saddam Hussein is allowed to
maintain his grip on Kuwait.
   ``The economic lifeline of the industrial world runs from the
(Persian) Gulf and we cannot permit a dictator such as this to sit
astride that economic lifeline,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker
III said Tuesday.
   ``To bring it down to the level of the average American citizen,
let me say that means jobs.''
   Baker suggested that a worldwide economic recession could result
if Saddam is not checked and the security of gulf oil reserves
ensured.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush must move to boost his
dwindling support among Congress and the American people for the
military buildup in the Persian Gulf, says Senate Republican leader
Bob Dole.
   ``With the election over, the budget behind us, the American
people are starting to focus on this. We've lost some support. We
need to regain it,'' Dole, R-Kan., said Tuesday.
   Faced with increasing discontent on Capitol Hill, the president
planned to meet today with a select group of lawmakers to discuss
the U.S. response to the crisis touched off by Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   The session comes less than a week after Bush announced 200,000
new U.S. troops will be sent to the gulf region to provide an
``offensive military option'' for use against Saddam Hussein's
Iraqi forces. About 230,000 U.S. troops are currently in the gulf
area.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Saudi Arabia, which is underwriting the U.S.
and allied military buildup in the Persian Gulf, has substantially
increased its financial assistance to Syria, diplomats and analysts
say.
   The United States bans aid to Syria because of its support for
terrorist groups, although relations between the two countries have
warmed since Syria sent troops to join the multinational coalition
against Iraq.
   Syria remains on the State Department's list of countries that
support terrorism and there has not been any move to change it,
said an official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Nor is the
United States encouraging the Saudis to increase their aid to the
Syrians, the official added.
   The U.S. official, along with a Syrian diplomat, denied a
published report that President Bush had brokered a deal,
presumably with the Saudis, to give Syria $1 billion in aid within
the past 10 days.

   CHICAGO (AP) - Taking a couple aspirins with a cocktail can get
you drunker, doctors warned today.
   Aspirin blocks the action of a stomach enzyme that breaks down
alcohol before it reaches the bloodstream, researchers reported in
the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``It's important that people be warned not to mix those two -
not to take aspirin before they drink, or rather, not to drink
after they take aspirin,'' Dr. Charles S. Lieber, director of the
Alcohol Research Center at the Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical
Center in New York, said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
   He and his colleagues studied aspirin and alcohol absorption in
five healthy men ages 30 to 45 years.

   BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) - A nickel will get you a loaf of bread this
week in North Dakota, where farmers are demonstrating against wheat
prices they say are forcing them out of business.
   Members of North Dakota's Farmers Union are selling 5-cent
loaves in every county, usually outside the courthouse where farm
foreclosures take place.
   Some customers are needy and come to buy bargain bread. But most
just want to show they support the farmers.
   ``It appears the crisis in agriculture is getting to be a pretty
severe problem, and as a banker I see more severe problems in the
future if they don't get their point across,'' said James Helgeson,
who was among the customers Tuesday.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Britain, Canada and other friendly governments
are complaining about an attempt by Congress to prevent U.S.
subsidiaries in their countries from doing business with Cuba.
   The issue centers on whether the United States has the right to
control the activities of American businesses abroad. The countries
where these subsidiaries are based have told the Bush
administration and Congress that the proposed law would infringe on
their sovereignty.
   ``It is the government of Canada which makes the laws and
policies that govern international trade and commerce by
Canada-based companies,'' Canadian Justice Minister Kim Campbell
said recently.
   The amendment was included in a bill governing exports. It is
awaiting President Bush's signature, but strong State Department
objections to other sections of the bill could lead to a veto.

   BONN, Germany (AP) - U.S. intelligence recruited hundreds of
guerrillas and laid weapons caches across Western Europe during the
early days of Cold War as part of preparations for a feared Soviet
invasion, a newspaper reported today.
   Only recently was the would-be resistance network disbanded -
and several former high-ranking European officials say some of its
hidden stockpiles of arms and explosives still existed just two
months ago.
   The top secret organization, brought to light last month in
Italy and codenamed Gladio there after the short swords used by
Roman gladiators, is now under investigation for possible links to
right-wing terrorism.
   The network is said to have had branches in Italy, Germany,
France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Austria, Spain,
Greece and Portugal. The respected German newspaper Die Welt said
today that even neutral Sweden and Switzerland took part.

   OSLO, Norway (AP) - Norwegian scientists are exploring the
possibility of a year-round route through the frozen ocean north of
Siberia that could change the way the world does busness.
   Unlike their Viking ancestors, who braved unknown seas in wooden
ships, these modern adventurers search from laboratories, with
computers and calculators.
   Oslo's Fridtjof Nansen Institute, named for the Norwegian
explorer, was enlisted by the Soviet Merchant Marine Ministry to
explore the feasibility of opening the Northeast Passage all year.
   The Soviets envision huge icebreakers leading merchant ships
through the polar icepack like outsize ducklings trailing their
mother.

   President Bush clashed Wednesday with leaders
of Congress trying to limit his war-making powers but assured
anxious lawmakers he has not decided to use military force to push
Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
   In a two-hour meeting, Democratic leaders insisted that Bush
must seek congressional approval before taking military action in
the Persian Gulf. He refused to give any such guarantee.
   ``The president did not indicate either a commitment to do that
or refusal to do that,'' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
said later.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Bush would follow the
Constitution, but he pointedly added, ``It's a question of what the
Constitution requires.''

   LONDON (AP) - Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine on
Wednesday challenged Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in a six-day
war for the leadership of the government and the Conservative
Party.
   Heseltine, who will stand against Mrs. Thatcher in a ballot
among the 372 Conservative legislators on Tuesday, accused her of
splitting the party on Europe and alienating voters with an
unpopular local government tax. The leader of the majority party
automatically becomes Prime Minister.
   The challenge by Heseltine, a handsome, self-made millionaire
who espouses a ``caring capitalism'' in contrast to Mrs. Thatcher's
rigorous free-market views, poses the biggest threat to her
survival since she won power more than 11 years ago.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - States must suspend the driver's licenses of
all convicted drug offenders or risk losing part of their federal
highway funds under newly approved legislation signed by President
Bush.
   The measure applies to all states and all illegal drugs,
including the 10 states where possession of small amounts of
marijuana has been decriminalized but is still considered an
infraction of the law.
   The legislation, included in the transportation appropriations
bill for the current fiscal year, got little attention during the
flurry of activity as Congress rushed to leave town at the end of
October.
   News that the measure had become law drew criticism from groups
as diverse as the National Governors Association and the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.

   DALLAS (AP) - Hostile teen-agers are likely to grow up to be
adults who have high cholesterol, according to a study that finds
new links between anger and heart trouble.
   For years, many experts assumed that hard-driving, impatient
people with classic Type A personalities were at high risk of heart
attacks. But many have grown skeptical of this theory, and some now
believe that the truly lethal personality trait is hostility and
anger.
   ``People with high hostility at age 19 tend to have high
cholesterol levels at 40,'' Dr. Redford B. Williams of Duke
University said Wednesday.
   Redford's study was among several presented at the annual
meeting of the American Heart Association to suggest that hostile
people are more prone to heart trouble - both because of the
effects of adrenaline and other hormones on their bodies and their
tendency to have unhealthy living habits.

   MOSCOW (AP) - The Soviet government said Wednesday it is lifting
controls on the prices of luxury goods in an effort to encourage
production. Only hours later, Russia's parliament declared the
decree void in the largest of the 15 Soviet republics.
   The move by the Russian Federation set up the latest struggle in
the war between the central Soviet and Russian governments. It
demonstrated the fragmentation and confusion plaguing the Soviet
Union as the base of power moves from the Kremlin to the republics.
   The battle began with a decree by the national Council of
Ministers that prices would be freed on goods ``of no essential
influence on people's living standards'' - such as jewelry,
furniture and American cigarettes.
   The central government decision marked the first time in decades
that the government has completely freed an entire range of retail
prices to respond to the market forces of supply and demand.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. Roman Catholic bishops on Wednesday
adopted their first comprehensive guidelines on human sexuality,
portraying it in exalting terms and calling for it to be taught in
Catholic schools.
   Against some opposition and attempts at delay, the document was
approved by a strong voice vote by the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops.
   It says sexual education should be taught in schools and
parishes as well as in families, a provision strongly opposed by
several bishops who said many parents want such education kept in
the home. One said families might remove their children from
Catholic schools if sex education is required.
   Describing sexuality as a ``wonderful gift,'' the bishops say
they approach the subject with a ``deep and abiding sense of
appreciation, wonder and respect.''

   Feng Xiaolin was clearly embarrassed in preparing
for her debut on Beijing's newest, most popular television show.
   ``This is just too awkward,'' she complained, following
instructions to walk across a miniature bridge toward the camera.
``I never wear these colors.''
   She tried to hide the bright pink sweater with an aquamarine
overcoat.
   Despite her discomfort, the 37-year-old divorcee went through
the shot several times, spurred by thoughts of the hoped-for
reward: a husband.
   Her video was to be shown on the matchmaking show ``Tonight We
Meet,'' which features two-minute spots of four to five single men
and women each week and invites viewers to contact the station for
dates.
   ``Tonight We Meet,'' the idea of the Beijing city government,
may seem modern and Western, but it also harks back to the Chinese
tradition of marriages arranged by go-betweens. The difference in
this case is that the decision to date or marry is made by the
couple rather than their parents.
   The communists tried to do away with matchmaking when they
gained power in 1949, but single people in China have few ways of
meeting potential mates. Varied dating and casual pickups are
frowned upon.
   Professional matchmaking centers have sprung up in recent years.
Singles register their names, vital statistics and criteria for a
spouse and await responses.
   There is more glamor on ``Tonight We Meet,'' which has been
broadcast for 20 minutes each Friday night since last summer.
Candidates for the show are filmed at work and play, in settings of
their choice.
   Ms. Feng, a medical worker, wore her uniform cap and gown and
posed in the laboratory of the university infirmary where she
works.
   Yang Guang, the host and editor, shouted encouragement
throughout the filming.
   ``You look beautiful!'' she called out. ``We're going to get a
whole mailbag full of letters for you!''
   She said the waiting list to get on the show was more than two
months long and that most applicants, like Ms. Feng, were divorcees
in their 30s or early 40s.
   ``They all say they are a pitiable generation'' because their
youth was disrupted by the radical Cultural Revolution of 1966-76,
Ms. Yang said. In that decade, many young people chose spouses on
the basis of their political convictions or because they had
residence permits for the cities.
   Unlike past generations, Ms. Feng said, people of her age are
not willing to stay in loveless marriages. ``We still feel young,
like we've still got a lot of life to live,'' she said.
   Ms. Yang, who is single, said no marriages had resulted from the
show but many couples had begun dating. A 60-year-old widower who
appeared reported receiving more than 100 letters from interested
women.
   For those who want to meet other singles but are not brave
enough to appear on television, the station holds dances. The
co-sponsor of the first dance was a firm called the Purple House,
which arranges fancy weddings, another revived tradition.
   For decades, ostentation was frowned upon as ideologically
unsound. Most couples simply got a marriage license and invited a
few friends and relatives to a quiet party.
   Higher living standards are bringing back old-fashioned wedding
bashes with new, Western touches.
   The Purple House, which opened in June, is the only operation of
its kind in China. For a fee, it can provide tuxedo and gown for
the bride and groom, limousine pickup, a wedding complete with
flower girl and attendants, a feast afterward and even a suite for
the wedding night.
   So far, it has arranged more than 50 weddings, said Zhao
Zhongfeng, assistant to the manager. She said couples already are
booking for January and February, the lunar new year season and
China's most popular time to get married.
   A typical wedding organized by the Purple House costs about
3,000 yuan ($633), which is 15 months' pay for the average worker.
The ceremonies are a mix of Chinese and Western customs.
   At one recent wedding, the couple walked in to the Wedding March
and promised Western-style to love and respect each other ``through
sickness and health,'' causing giggles among guests who had never
heard such vows.
   Then, Chinese-style, the couple took a sip of wine and bowed to
their guests, employers and parents.
   Finally, socialist-style, they bowed to each other while the
master of ceremonies reminded them that Chinese law allowed them to
have only one child.

<HEAD>Stronger Singapore Presidency Seems Designed for Lee Kuan Yew</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ceremonial presidency is being replaced by
an elected office with executive powers, which Lee Kwan Yew may
intend for himself sometime after he retires as prime minister.
   Lee steps down Nov. 28 after 31 years of running the government,
but is not bidding farewell to power.
   He will be a senior member without portfolio in the Cabinet of
new Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, and continue as head of the
governing People's Action Party.
   Goh, 49, has been first deputy prime minister of this tiny
island republic since 1984, spent 13 years in the Cabinet and now
is defense minister. He expects the current Parliament session to
end about two months after he takes over, as soon as it amends the
constitution to strengthen the presidency.
   The revised office will have wide veto power over budgets and
spending of the prosperous city-state's financial assets, estimated
to total more than $47 billion.
   Appointments to key posts in the civil service, police, military
and judiciary, on statutory boards and in state-owned companies
would be subject to approval by the president, who is to be elected
directly for a six-year term.
   He also would have power over the use of the Internal Seise the new
duties for the rest of
his current term, which expires in 1993, ``as if he had been
elected.''
   The proposed constitutional change was the main issue of the
last general election in 1988. In responding to opposition charges
that he intended to retain power after retiring as prime minister,
Lee pledged not to be the first of the new presidents.
   He has not, however, ruled out seeking the office later. Lee is
a fit 67.
   Critics say the presidency will be so powerful it will virtually
end the country's British style of government, in which Parliament
is supreme.
   To that argument, Goh responds: ``So long as any government
abides by the principles of financial prudence and meritocracy in
governing Singapore, this bill will not have any real effect on
it.''
   Opposition politicians contend the amendment would
institutionalize the People's Action Party by eroding the powers of
Parliament. The party has been in power, led by Lee, since 1959 and
holds 80 of the 81 elected legislative seats.
   Some Singaporeans feel the amendment ``is designed for the prime
minister'' and enacting it now indicates the ``new leadership is
not confident of itself, or our older masters have doubts about the
integrity and capability of the new generation leaders and the
electorate,'' Chandra Dasa said. He is a member of Parliament and
head of the government Feedback Unit, which samples public opinion.
   Goh said the change is necessary because ``there are inadequate
checks in our present parliamentary system of government.'' He
cited the lack of a restraining upper house in the unicameral
system.
   He rejected calls by the opposition, and even some retired
lawmakers from the governing party, for a referendum before the
constitution is amended.
   Lee Siew Choh of the Worker's Party said such existing
institutions as the judiciary, civil service and Parliament would
provide enough checks and balances if allowed to function freely.
   Goh has said his administration plans no major policy
initiatives. Political analysts agree that Lee's retention of the
party leadership and the ascendency of his son will ensure that no
fundamental changes take place.
   The incoming prime minister recently appointed Trade and
Industry Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 38, the prime minister's eldest
son, to serve as one of his two deputies.
   That came as no surprise. Goh acknowledged earlier that the
younger Lee was his logical successor as prime minister.
   Now, however, Goh finds it necessary to insist he will not play
a transitional role to keep the seat warm for the leader's
ambitious son.

   For the first time in years, trees festooned
with Christmas lights are to adorn Moscow's Red Square. Carols will
sound alongside Kremlin walls and cathedral bells will ring.
   That is only part of an extended public celebration organized by
the Soviet-U.S. Joint Conference on Charitable Cooperation.
   A host of American and Soviet individuals and institutions are
listed as participants, ranging from the Bolshoi Ballet and Moscow
Circus to Eastman Kodak and the Episcopal Church.
   ``It will be the first noticeable Christmas for Moscow in 70
years,'' says the Rev. J.S. Canty, an American Episcopal priest who
heads the joint conference.
   Moscow's city council gave its approval last month.
   The open holiday display, featuring musical and other
performances, especially for handicapped children, along with
sparkling decorations and festivities promises a rare spectacle for
the drab Soviet capital.
   ``Such an event!'' observed the Evening Moscow, a 4.5
million-circulation newspaper. ``Neither Moscow nor the rest of the
country has ever seen anything like it.''
   Already, huge banners and wreaths proclaiming ``Merry Christmas
Moscow!'' and ``Happy New Year World'' in English and Russian hang
in the Soviets' largest state department store, GUM, off Red
Square.
   ``Red,'' or ``krasny'' in modern Russian, also meant ``bright''
or ``beautiful'' in old Russian, and the square is to take on some
particular beauty on Christmas Eve.
   Plans are for the 36 tall elm trees along one side of the square
to glow with red and green lights provided by General Electric,
with an amplified reading of the Christmas story from the Gospel of
Luke.
   The program calls for singing of carols and playing by the
70-piece Soviet navy band, which has newly learned ``Jingle Bells''
and is working on other melodies such as ``Silent Night'' and
``Hark, the Herald Angels Sing.''
   Advance material says the celebration aims to ``introduce and
promote non-commercial values of Christmas,'' including ``charity,
love, peace, brotherhood and caring for the less fortunate.''
   A huge exchange of Christmas cards is being urged to decorate a
45-foot fir tree at the GUM store in Moscow and another huge tree
at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City.
   Americans also have been urged to send toys, clothes and food,
in care of Canty, Hotel Rossia, Moscow, U.S.S.R. 103495, to be
given as gifts to orphans, the handicapped, the disadvantaged and
the sick.
   Canty, who has lived and worked in Moscow for three years as
head of a joint Soviet-U.S. project battling alcoholism, said
economic conditions there are ``the worst I've ever seen,'' with
acute shortages in ordinary necessities.
   He said in an interview that introducing the genuine Christmas
spirit was ``important for morale.''
   ``The celebration is not geared to commercialism or making money
or looked at as a shopping season,'' he added. ``It is to remind
people of the traditional values of Christmas as seen against a
very austere backdrop.
   ``It's to remind them of the importance of giving, of caring for
someone else, especially the stranger, the sick and needy.
Individual charity was not a part of communism.''
   While churches in the Soviet Union have observed Christmas -
Protestants on Dec. 25 and Russian Orthodox on Jan. 7 - it has been
kept carefully confined to the churches, a religious occasion
without public notice, sounds or sights.
   Co-chairman of this year's celebrations with Canty is the
popular Soviet singer Alla Pugacheva.
   He said there would be different events almost every day
beginning Dec. 20 and ending Jan. 7 with a dinner honoring Russian
Orthodox seminarians and elderly clergy at the Hotel Rossia.
   Candle-lit ecumenical prayers of thanksgiving in Red Square are
to conclude the celebration.
   For the American end of the event, Canty said, Russian
``matryoshka'' dolls were collected in Moscow for Christmas
distribution to AIDS patients in this country.
   He said about 30,000 tickets to various performances have been
arranged for the Moscow events, starting Dec. 20 with lighting of a
huge Christmas tree in the GUM store decorated with cards from
America.
   There are to be a half-dozen performances of the Moscow Circus,
variously honoring war veterans, policemen, firemen, ambulance
attendants, orphans and handicapped children, teen-agers, old
people, sailors and soldiers.
   Other events listed include a Bolshoi Ballet performance of the
``Nutcracker Suite,'' a Christmas variety show at the Palace of
Congresses, awards to ``Moscow's Most Caring Persons,'' a banquet
for recovering alcoholics, visits by entertainers to hospitals, and
a Santa Claus luncheon for children.

<HEAD>Fate of Hostages in Lebanon May Be Linked to Persian Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fate of America's invisible hostages is
bound up in a maze of shifting interests and allegiances -
crosscurrents that could yet serve the cause of freedom for six
U.S. captives in Lebanon.
   Pressure and attention are concentrated on the confrontation
with Iraq, and on nearly 1,000 Americans detained, deployed as
human shield hostages at potential military targets, or hiding from
Saddam Hussein's regime. There are no clear and current demands for
specific concessions as the price of release for the 13 western
hostages in Lebanon.
   But there have been frequent reports that one step might lead to
another.
   And in those circumstances, a gesture need not be a surrender to
the demands of kidnappers. A policy that bars negotiating
concessions to terrorists does not necessarily preclude granting
what is not demanded.
   Israel is in a position to take steps of that sort. That
government controls the forces holding an estimated 340 Shi'ite
captives in southern Lebanon. Forty others were freed on Oct. 1.
The Israelis also hold a militant Moslem cleric captured last year,
Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid.
   Freeing such prisoners would not necessarily get the western
hostages out of captivity. But even a gesture toward that end might
take a little of the strain out of U.S.-Israeli relations, under
stress since the Persian Gulf crisis began and worsened by the
killings of 19 Palestinian Arabs in rioting at Temple Mount in
Jerusalem on Oct. 8. Israel has refused to accept a United Nations
investigation of the shootings, an inquiry supported by the United
States, which also voted for a U.N. resolution denouncing the
shootings.
   That episode posed a problem for the fragile U.S. alliance with
Arab states in opposition to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. And
the Israelis suspect Washington of tilting away from them in favor
of the U.N.-sanctioned front against Saddam.
   The original ransom demand for at least some of the American
hostages has, ironically, been met or rendered moot by the Aug. 2
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. It was a demand for the release of 15
Shi'ite Moslems imprisoned in Kuwait since 1983 for terrorist
bombings at the U.S. and French embassies, government buildings and
oil facilities. That price tag for the freedom of western hostages
had been repeated periodically in messages from Islamic Holy War,
the group holding two U.S. hostages.
   Its captives are Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
of The Associated Press, now in his sixth year as a hostage, and
Thomas Sutherland, a dean at the American University in Beirut,
kidnapped later in 1985. The western hostages in Lebanon all are
believed held by factions linked with a pro-Iranian group called
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The Kuwaiti prisoners are out now. The two Lebanese Shi'ites
among them said to be back in Lebanon, the others, most of them
Iraqis who had opposed Saddam Hussein, are believed to be in Iran,
although Middle East analysts say there is no firm information on
their whereabouts. Nor is it known whether they escaped, or were
freed, or were sezed by the Iraqis in the invasion and later
turned over to Iran as part of Saddam's effort to improve relations
with his old enemy.
   In opposing Saddam Hussein, the United States is aligned with
Syria, another power in the hostage situation. A move to free
hostages could help make that alliance of necessity into a more
durable relationship. The Syrians hope eventually to gain U.S.
support for a general Middle East peace conference, a forum in
which they would seek to reclaim territory lost to Israel.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with Syrian President
Hafez Assad in Damascus on Sept. 14, and said he raised the hostage
question then. He said Assad ``did not indicate any expectation
that they would be released soon.''
   A month later, the Syrians used the military forces with which
they dominate much of Lebanon to put down the rebellion of a
Christian faction in Beirut, backing the government in imposing a
settlement under which rival militias are to withdraw from the
capital, ending a long civil war. There are about 40,000 Syrian
troops in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah has moved its militia from southern Beirut to villages
in eastern and southeastern Lebanon. Syrian forces controlled the
roads from Beirut, and in moving eastward, the captors would have
had to take their hostages across those lines.
   Syrian officials have said repeatedly that they want to help
gain release of the hostages, to end a situation they say they do
not control.
   Iran is said to wield a more powerful influence although it,
too, is indirect. The latest in a series of reports of imminent
release for British hostages came this week from a radical Iranian
leader, who said he opposed it.
   More moderate Iranian officials are said to favor release of the
hostages this year, as a step toward improved relations with the
West. As President Bush said when he came to office, good will
begets good will.

<HEAD>Tax Advice: Taking It Personally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Get the face-lift right away, but put off the
wedding until January.''
   People used to get advice like that from palm-readers,
astrologers, or the person who cut their hair. Today it could just
as easily come from a tax accountant.
   That number-crunching counsel has a special immediacy at the
moment, with an income-tax year about to end and a set of new
rules, passed by Congress a few weeks ago, ready to take effect in
1991.
   Any financial adviser with a reasonable sense of perspective
will hasten to acknowledge that man, or woman, does not live by
calculator computations alone.
   Still, experts on these matters say, if there aren't any other
overriding factors involved, some judicious tax timing right now on
matters ranging from cosmetic surgery to marriage or divorce can
make a significant dollars-and-cents difference.
   Consider the common tummy tuck, hair electrolysis or any other
procedure designed to improve one's appearance.
   The cost of cosmetic surgery has heretofore been eligible for
inclusion in the list of medical expenses that may qualify for a
tax deduction, if the total exceeds 7.5 percent of your adjusted
gross income.
   But starting Jan. 1 that will no longer be the case. The Revenue
Reconciliation Act of 1990 decrees that costs of cosmetic surgery
will no longer be deductible except in cases arising from injury,
disease or congenital defect.
   What's more, note the professional tax-watchers at the New York
firm of Matthew Bender &amp; Co., if you get reimbursed for
non-deductible surgery expenses by a health insurance plan at work,
the money paid is ``not excludable from gross income.'' In other
words, it could result in a bigger tax bill.
   The logical response to all this, as summarized by another tax
reporting firm, the Research Institute of America: ``Consider
having the surgery done in '90 if the expenditure will yield a '90
deduction.''
   The ``think taxes first'' message also applies to a couple who
are mapping plans for a wedding or a divorce around New Year's.
   Schedule the nuptials or the official divorce date for the right
side of midnight Dec. 31, tax experts advise, and maybe you can use
the tax savings to pay for a chunk of the honeymoon.
   ``A taxpayer's marital status for the entire year is determined
as of Dec. 31,'' the Research Institute of America points out. ``If
he gets married (or divorced) on that date he will be treated as if
he were married (or single) all year long.''
   Because of various quirks in the tax system, money owed to Uncle
Sam can vary substantially with marital status.
   To illustrate, the RIA cited the example of two people making
$50,000 each. Filing jointly as a married couple, the firm
reckoned, they would owe about $1,625 more in federal income taxes
than they would as separate, single filers.
   But if one half of the couple has a large income and the other a
relatively small one, the effect can be reversed, giving a savings
of a few hundred dollars to the marrieds.
   Therefore, says the accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young, a couple
with approximately equal incomes might opt for a January marriage
or a December divorce; a couple with a big difference in incomes
might be better offer choosing marriage in the old year or divorce
in the new.
   Some years ago, the existence of the ``marriage penalty'' gave
rise to an especially exotic tax dodge: To save on taxes, a couple
could theoretically divorce each December and remarry in January.
   That trick won't work now, the Internal Revenue Service asserts.
People who get a temporary ``tax divorce'' will be required to file
as a married couple anyway.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While some of America's larger companies have
been loading up on debt, some of the country's smaller businesses
have been heading in the opposite direction.
   The tendency to avoid debt largely has been overlooked, in part
because the borrowing binge of larger companies stole the
headlines. That binge was spectacular, as you might agree after
reviewing some of the evidence, to wit:
   -Non-financial corporate borrowing as a percentage of gross
national product rose to 67 percent in 1989 from 47 percent 20
years earlier and 39 percent 30 years ago.
   -In the 20 years through 1989, the ratio of interest expense to
corporate earnings more than doubled to 40 percent.
   -In the late 1980s, half of all funds raised by non-financial
corporations came from debt. As recently as the 1960s and 1970s,
the average was about half that.
   Those increases resulted largely from activity among the biggest
companies, and of course they involved junk bonds used in
takeovers. Since 1983, more than $500 billion of equities have
disappeared, largely replaced by borrowed funds.
   Smaller businesses, however, seem not to have steered in that
direction but to have taken a more conservative and, by most
measures, a more responsible course. They seem to have become
averse to debt.
   Indications of that choice are contained in the latest quarterly
report on small business financing, based on more than 2,000
detailed responses from members of the National Federation of
Independent Business. To wit:
   ``The percent of firms borrowing on a regular basis fell to 34
percent, a record-low for borrowing activity. Among small firms,
credit demand is not strong.''
   That all-time low - the survey was begun in 1974 - did not make
a sudden midappearance, either; the trend has been toward less
borrowing since the 1980s, the very time during which the big
companies were loading up on debt.
   Economist William C. Dunkelberg, who devised the survey and now
interprets its findings, observes that average debt among the
companies studied runs less than $100,000, with the median debt
about $50,000.
   According to Dunkelberg, dean of Temple University's school of
business and management, the responses reflect attitudes and
experiences of a small-business community that produces 50 percent
of America's gross private product.
   Why such a pronounced difference of attitudes between the
big-business sector and the small? The survey's goal was to
determine attitudes rather than probe the reasons why, but
possibilities are obvious.
   Many small businesses reflect the attitudes of the founder. The
founder might still be the active head of the operation, and as
such more personally concerned with its well-being and that of its
employees.
   Such people guard their companies from danger, one of which is a
heavy debt load. To them, the company is a life's work rather than
an impersonal operation whose goal is to grow at any cost. They are
highly competitive and not averse to risk, but prudence guides
their every move. They are likely to finance from within, from
sales, rather than by borrowing from outsiders.
   In contrast, larger concerns may be run by hired management.
Such managers earn stripes by forever raising sales and earnings.
They are under constant pressure to take risks - from shareholders,
stock analysts and competitors.
   Because of this, they might do as so many did during the 1980s,
and that is seek growth and earnings through acquisitions, financed
of course with borrowed money.
   Experience in the 1980s also shows that large, public companies
are subject to being raided by outsiders if they fail to maintain
constant growth. And if they are raided, the raider's financing
might come from junk bonds.
   The phenomenon may not have been studied in enough detail to
determine all the reasons, but it is there to be seen and studied:
while big business loaded up on debt, smaller companies watch their
budgets, and are better off for it.

   Some captains of industry offer a perennially
repeated message to their fellow Americans - read the Bible each
day. It's the key to good and productive lives, they say.
   A group founded by business people has been stressing that
advice for half a century in its sponsorship of National Bible
Week, which this year is Nov. 18-25.
   On the 50th anniversary observance of the event, the current
national chairman, Richard M. DeVos, president of Amway Corp.,
said:
   ``My goal is to encourage every American to make daily Bible
reading a personal commitment. God interacts with us in many ways.
I believe one of the best ways to find and follow him is through
the pages of your Bible.''
   Special events for the week are planned in about 10,000
communitities, along with public service media ads and state and
local proclamations, to sress the Bible's importance in American
history and culture.
   The sponsoring Laymen's National Bible Association was started
in 1940 by a small group of New York businessmen. It since has
expanded to include businessmen throughout the country as well as
public officeholders.
   ``The Bible gives us a positive pattern to live by, and also a
program to die by ...,'' said DeVos, a member of the Christian
Reformed church. ``Other patterns are some person's theory, but the
Bible is ... what God says we ought to be.
   ``It's vital to our behavior and society. It's the guidebook to
life.''
   While presidents, governors and mayors also lend backing to the
association's Bible campaign, leading businessmen have been its
working mainstays.
   ``There are a tremendous number of business people throughout
the country who are very good and devout people interested in this
cause,'' said Victor W. Eimicke, the association's president the
last nine years as well as president of V.W. Eimicke Associates, a
Bronxville, N.Y.-based producer of business forms.
   Eimicke, a Dutch Reformed Church member who holds a doctorate in
industrial psychology, said recent Wall Street scandals produced a
``feeling that something was very wrong with the ethics of
businessmen.''
   But that's a mistaken image, he said, ``it's not
representative.'' He said 99 percent of the business people he has
known were ``fine, upright people,'' many of ``strong faith.''
   Noting that a different national business figure each year is
chairman of the Bible drive, he said they are ``a who's who of the
business world, wonderful, wonderful people.''
   The executive chosen as national chairman recruits about 100
business people as associate chairmen, who in turn each recruit 10
to 15 others, thus totaling 1,000 to 1,500 each year.
   ``Over the years, you've had 50,000 or more business people
participating,'' Eimicke said.
   Eimicke, whose family has a longtime custom of reading from the
Bible each morning at breakfast, said, ``I believe that unless we
get back to the basic principles in the Bible, we're not going to
solve the many problems around us.''
   He cited the drug problem, saying more spending and legal
crackdowns won't solve it.
   ``We'll stop it when families again start gathering around the
breakfast table each day, and give young people some self-esteem,''
enabling them to know their own worth so they will spurn drugs, he
said.
   President Bush and his wife served as honorary chairmen of this
year's Bible week. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo was the governors
chairman and New York City Mayor David Dinkins was the mayors
chairman.
   At a luncheon Friday preceding this week's observance, the
association planned to accord special recognition to the
translation committee of the New Revised Standard Version of the
Bible, which was sponsored by the National Council of Churches and
issued this year by eight publishers.
   The Rev. Reuben H. Gums, executive director of the association,
said Gallup surveys indicated 8 million people increased Bible
reading as result of a recent year's observance of Bible Week.
   For the current observance, President Bush said:
   ``The Bible has not only influenced the development of our
nation's values and institutions but also enriched the daily lives
of millions of men and women who have looked to it for comfort,
hope and guidance.''

   A United Church of Christ policy-making
board says women should have access to a controversial French
``abortion pill'' if the drug meets federal safety standards.
   Believed to be the first major denominational agency to take
such a stand, the 50-member board of directors of the church's
Board for Homeland Ministries voted to urge U.S. testing of the
pill, known as RU-486.
   If scientific experts find the pill meets federal standards of
safety and effectiveness, the Food and Drug Administration should
ensure it is available to women, the board said.
   The denomination is among the few taking a clearly pro-choice
view about abortion.
   The board also voiced strong support for a universal health care
system and urged President Bush to refrain from striking Iraq
unless the Iraqis attack first.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - The United Methodist Publishing House
reported sales of $100.4 million at the end of its 1990 fiscal
year.
   That included $3.6 million in sales of the new United Methodist
Hymnal and better than predicted sales of 270,000 copies of the New
Revised Standard Version of the Bible.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Bishop James Malone of Youngstown, Ohio,
chairman of the domestic policy committee of the U.S. Catholic
Conference, voiced ``deep disappointment'' at the failure of
Congress to override President Bush's veto of the Civil Rights Act
of 1990.
   Several Jewish organizations also expressed dismay.
   Robert K. Lifton, president of the American Jewish Congress,
called the veto a ``cruel slap in the face of thousands of
African-Americans, women, Hispanics, Jews and other minorities who
are victims of employment discrimination.''
   ---
   NEW YORK (AP) - Two U.S. Moslem leaders have urged an
international commission to investigate charges of ``violence,
looting and rape by Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait.''
   Al-Haj Dawood Al-Hawie, president of the National Council on
Islamic Affairs, and M.T. Mehdi of the American-Arab Relations
Committee, cabled Iraqi President Saddam Hussein asking him to
permit such an inquiry ``in the name of justice and the reputation
of Iraq, the Arabs and Islam.''

   TOKYO (AP) - Several Christian groups, including the National
Christian Council in Japan, expressed grave misgivings about the
Nov. 12 enthronement ceremony of the Japanese emperor, saying it
suggested his deification and absolute reign.

   NEW YORK (AP) - An Episcopal minister who walked across the
country seeking to raise concerns about the environment says she
hopes Americans will rethink their lifestyle.
   ``The walk encouraged people to see things differently - to ask
new questions about the high amounts of energy and food we consume
...,'' said the Rev. Judith Ain of Watsonville, Calif., who ended
her walk Oct. 24 at the United Nations. ``It helped to model some
new ways of living ... more conscious of the environment.''
   She estimated more than 1,000 people took part in the ``Global
Walk for a More Livable World'' at some points along the way.
Participants spoke at churches and schools in behalf of ecological
concerns, sleeping in tents on church property and sometimes under
the open sky.
   Ms. Ain, who wore out three pairs of shoes on the walk, said:
``It is so clear that our way of life is out of balance with the
planet ... In our patterns of consumption and a willingness to go
to war in the Persian Gulf for our lifestyle, we go on as if we're
having a party. But what we really need is a time of repentance and
fasting.''

Fields</HEAD>

   The harvest has been abundant this year -
fat tomatoes, sweet potatoes, melons, pecans and purple-hull peas.
The rains came, as farmers gathered in a spring field prayed they
would.
   ``We were blessed,'' produce grower Louis Lazzari said.
   At Thanksgiving dinner in Annie White's house, the grace her ill
80-year-old husband Jack plans to say will be simple: ``He'll say
he hopes it continues.''
   By that, she meant not just the fecundity of the good earth here
by Mobile Bay, but the sharing of its riches between farmers like
Lazzari and families like hers, families in need, through people
known as ``gleaners.''
   From bean-growing time in the spring to the gathering of mustard
greens, turnips and broccoli in cool weather, farmers invite the
gleaners into their fields to take what's left behind after
harvest.
   On one afternoon this summer, 200 hands picked 16,220 pounds of
tomatoes. Altogether last year, the gleaners, organized by a local
group called Ecumenical Ministries, carried away 100,000 pounds of
vegetables and fruits.
   The pickers must be needy. They cannot sell anything they glean.
And they must share it with someone else in need - such as the
Whites, who cannot pick on their own because they're disabled.
   The rules are as simple as the verses from the Old Testament
that underlie the 10-year-old project.
   ``When thou cuttest down thine harvest ... and hast forgotten a
sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it,'' enjoins
Deuteronomy 24:19-21.
   ``It shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the
widow. That the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the work of
thine hands.''
   Mrs. White, who at 69 has heart trouble and more other ailments
than she can name, and whose husband has cancer, learned of
Ecumenical Ministries about eight years ago, on a day she was
desperate for food. ``That day, I really didn't have anything to
cook,'' she said.
   ``Before I looked around, it was no time before they were out
with boxes and bags of groceries,'' she said.
   After that, gleaners brought regular deliveries of whatever
vegetable was in season. Without the food, she said, ``I guess I'd
starve.''
   The program began a decade ago with Dot Threadgill, who saw a
television news item about people from a California senior citizens
center who supplemented their diet by picking leftovers in the
fields.
   Mrs. Threadgill's energy seems to keep the gleaning operations
going - and growing, from about 300 pounds of food distributed
during the first year, ``about half of that out of my garden,'' she
said.
   Now, 15 farmers call her or she calls them as harvests near. And
she's learned tricks over the years.
   ``Mechanical harvesters can't pick where they turn, at the end
of the rows,'' she said, referring to potato picking machines. ``So
we know where to be.''
   She scouts the fields, estimating how many gleaners the crop
will feed plentifully - ``We don't want them to use their gas money
and not have sufficient for several days.'' Then she quickly goes
to the ``telephone tree'' to mobilize pickers before the farmer
plows the field under to prepare for the next crop.
   Suzanne Zellner got a call when a turnip patch was offered
recently. She and her husband have five children, the youngest
2{-year-old twins. Besides improving nutrition and stretching
grocery money, gleaning has an educational value, she said,
teaching children ``how to pick, how to know when something's ready
or when it's too ripe.''
   Another regular in the fields is Gussie Winston, 53, who first
went gleaning because her family had nothing to eat, but now makes
ends meet with housekeeping jobs and gleans and cans vegetables for
herself and a list of mostly elderly people unable to get out
themselves.
   ``When you become a gleaner, you're an emissary,'' she said,
looking across a sunny field to pickers stooped at their work.
``You're supposed to see that no one goes hungry.''
   For Mrs. Threadgill, that requires judicious juggling of her
phone list. For instance, she said, ``I know that Mary Jones has 10
or 15 people under her; so I know that if there's only enough for
10 or 15 I don't need to call but Mary ...
   ``And if we get peas for Mary this week, we call somebody else,
and kind of divide around the wealth.''
   And the wealth keeps blooming.
   Around the Fourth of July, one farmer makes sure to call the
gleaners to gather ripe watermelons.
   Just before Christmas last year, a rare spell of extreme cold
brought a call from another farmer who said he couldn't protect all
of his broccoli crop. The gleaners cut 1,200 pounds.
   A grower who has a U-pick operation, with tomatoes planted in a
staggered schedule, offers the gleaners what's left in ``dead-ripe
patches'' that his paying customers picked through the week before.
   Standing in the shade of an old pecan tree on his farm,
60-year-old Louis Lazzari said the vagaries of the market sometimes
open his fields to the gleaners.
   ``This year, one day I sold my broker 240 bushel boxes of beans
and he wanted the next day 340,'' he said. ``I had the beans, some
of the prettiest I ever raised in my life.'' But the going price
wouldn't have covered expenses. ``After I paid the help, I paid for
the box, I paid the freight to the place of business, I don't know
honestly but I may have went backwards.
   ``I could have plowed 'em under,'' Lazzari said. But really he
couldn't. ``It hurts me so bad to see something ... go to waste,''
he said. And he knows there are plenty of people here who haven't
had his good fortune.
   ``I was born in the Depression,'' he said, ``but I never had to
go to bed one day in my life without a decent meal, I'm thankful to
say.''
   Instead of plowing those pretty beans under, he phoned Mrs.
Threadgill.
   Once, a few years ago, Lazzari spontaneously called and offered
sweet corn, 30 big croker sacks of sweet corn.
   Mrs. Threadgill went back a few days later to thank him with a
cake. ``He said, `You know, I had that big field of corn, and it
wasn't moving. After I gave you that 30 sacks, that evening a man
came and bought the whole field from me.' ''

<HEAD>Mercury Capri: Comfort Standard on Sporty `Funabout'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, Graphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1991 Mercury Capri XR2 is a pleasant surprise.
   Its low-slung body and sporty styling hint at a jolting, sporty
ride. But the Capri XR2's all-strut suspension is damped somewhat,
giving passengers a softer ride that doesn't rattle the bones.
   The Capri XR2's convertible top could make for a loud, tiring
trip, full of engine noise. But the engine sound and road noise on
this front-drive car, while noticeable, are not overbearing.
   The cute, appealing look of this ``funabout,'' as Ford Motor Co.
likes to call the Capri, also could tempt the company to set high
prices. But the Capri ranges from $12,990 to $15,920 - attractive
enough to invite comparisons with its two main competitors, the
Mazda Miata (with a base price of $13,800) and Volkswagen Cabriolet
(base price, $15,500).
   ``The Capri is designed to be a fun-to-drive car, ... but we
didn't forget value and versatility,'' said Ross H. Roberts, a Ford
vice president and Lincoln-Mercury general manager.
   It took seven years for the Capri to evolve out of a concept car
called the Barchetta (Italian for little boat) that appeared at the
1983 Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany. In the end, the Capri's
outside design came from the Ghia Studios of Turin, Italy; its
powertrain and chassis were built with the help of Mazda of Japan,
and assembly is done in Australia.
   The blended heritage works well. The test car, an upscale XR2
turbo, seemed at ease in many sport maneuvers as well as on
leisurely Sunday drives.
   The Capri handled easily, fitting into tight parking spaces and
dodging between cars in passing maneuvers without a lot of effort.
   Fuel economy was commendable - about 24 miles per gallon in
demanding city-highway driving.
   The 1.6-liter, four-cylinder turbo, teamed with a five-speed
manual transmission, provided up to 132 horsepower in the XR2 and
was peppy. That's compared with the 116 horsepower produced by the
Miata's 1.6-liter engine. Turbo lag in the Capri wasn't troublesome
in most instances. The transmission shifter felt a bit notchy,
however.
   The cloth driver seat had adjustable lumbar support and was
quite comfortable. There was an air bag in the leather-wrapped
steering wheel, and the interior design of gauges, including turbo
boost, was commendably functional.
   The cloth back seat was another matter. It was benchlike and was
a stiff resting spot with a straight seatback. I hit my head on a
bar on the convertible roof while sitting there. I could not hold
my head up straight, yet I couldn't scrunch down more in the seat
because my knees were already hitting the front seatback.
   The convertible top fit tightly and there were no whistles,
rattles or wind noise, though it wasn't as easy to put down as the
Miata ragtop. The Capri involved a couple more steps than the
Miata. Both cars have cloth tops that must be put up and down
manually. But a plastic boot covered the Capri convertible roof
neatly, while the Miata canvas cover does not provide such a smooth
appearance. Both vehicles offer optional hard tops for cold weather
travel.
   The Capri trunk was nicely carpeted and offered space for two
golf bags or a half dozen grocery bags. The rear seat also folds
down to allow more cargo space.
   Ford expects to produce 30,000 Capris annually once production
reaches full speed in the next year. Since introduction in
mid-July, more than 4,600 Capris have been sold.
   Because the Capri is a new vehicle, Consumer Reports magazine
does not list owner complaints.

   Come on, says Mother Wonderful. Have some
cheesecake. It won't kill you.
   ``No one ever got cardiovascular disease from a sliver of
cheesecake now and then,'' says Mother Wonderful, alias Myra
Chanin. ``Don't eat cheesecake three times a day, but when you do
have it, enjoy it to the max.''
   Chanin's book, ``Mother Wonderful's Cheesecakes and Other
Goodies,'' first came out in 1982 and went out of print. The second
edition now is in its second printing.
   Chanin, whose cheesecakes come in flavors like ginger pear,
mocha blanca and honey fig, isn't surprised. She sees good food as
essential for marital bliss.
   ``Soft lights, sweet music and diaphanous gowns may create an
evening's diversion, but comes the dawn and even Casanova must
eat,'' she says in the book's introduction.
   Professional bakers agree that cheesecakes haven't lost their
attraction.
   ``We're selling more than ever,'' said Janet Rosing, owner of
Cheesecakes by J.R. in Chicago.
   Ms. Rosing estimates she sells more than five tons of cheesecake
a week. ``It's fun to visualize, isn't it?'' she said.
   Nancy Bier, owner of Miss Grimble Associates in New York, says
people think of cheesecake as something special.
   ``When people want dessert and want to splurge, they say, `Let's
have a piece of cheesecake.' Everyone likes the flavor and the fact
that it's so rich.''
   Miss Grimble's has been in business for about 20 years and turns
out about 50 different cakes and pies, but Mrs. Bier said
cheesecake still is the No.1 item.
   ``The classic vanilla with a sour cream topping is the best
seller,'' she said.
   Several qualities come together to make a good cheesecake, Ms.
Rosing said.
   ``It's a combination of creamy texture, which is very
satisfying, and the flavors of the cream and the sweetness,'' she
said. ``People feel they're really getting value in cheesecake.
There's really something substantial there. It's not some light,
fluffy thing.''
   Even a doctor from the American Heart Association went along -
somewhat - with Mother Wonderful's idea that a sliver of cheesecake
once in a while isn't all that bad.
   ``I would certainly agree with a sliver now and then, but what
does one call a sliver?'' said Dr. Alan Chait, chairman of the
AHA's Nutrition Committee. ``And if you bake a whole cheesecake,
who's going to eat just a sliver?''
   Chait, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington,
said the AHA doesn't preach the idea of good or bad food.
   ``The important thing is a person's total diet - a diet that is
low in saturated fat and cholesterol - rather than the individual
food,'' he said.
   Both the AHA's cookbook and Mother Wonderful offer low-fat
cheesecake suggestions.
   Chanin also offers encouragement to the nervous cook.
   ``Cheesecake is the easiest dessert to make! How did it get such
an awesome reputation? Bakers lie. When you find out how easy it is
to make cheesecake, you'll stop paying $25 for theirs and start
baking your own.''
   She thinks the problem is the old-fashioned ways of baking.
   ``People are still using recipes that were created in 1850.
Ovens then had no thermostats, so they'd tell you to bake the cake
in the oven for half an hour and leave them in the oven with the
door ajar. You couldn't leave the house!
   ``Then there are those recipes that tell you to put your
cheesecake pan in a pan filled with boiling water! I think that one
was invented by Johnson &amp; Johnson, to sell more Band-Aids. There's
no better way in the world to scald yourself.''
   There's none of that in this cookbook. What Chanin does offer is
advice such as how to get that creamy, custardlike texture.
   ``Since I never want to unwrap another package of cream cheese,
I pass on all my secrets to you,'' she confides before introducing
her ``Ten Commandments for Making Perfectly Baked Cheesecakes Every
Time.''
   Actually, there are 17 commandments, which Chanin admits tends
to prove her husband's contention that she is ``bossier than God.''
Among them:
   -Thou Shalt Not Chintz on Ingredients.
   -Thou Shalt Never Defile Thy Crusts with Graham Cracker Crumbs.
   -Thou Shalt Never Even Think About Using Those Gunky Cornstarch
Toppings.
   -Thou Shalt Measure Out Ingredients before Beginning to Bake.
   -Thou Shalt Always Add Eggs to Thy Batter with Thy Mixer on the
Lowest Speed.
   She really means it about using the best ingredients.
   ``The cost differential between a sublime cheesecake and a
third-rate one is less than $3. If money is a problem, make an
8-inch version and serve petite wedges, but always make sure anyone
who tastes it will rave about your skill and beg for more.''

   They make an odd trio: Tom Selleck, the
easygoing sleuth of ``Magnum P.I.,'' Ted Danson, the libidinous
barkeep of ``Cheers'' and Steve Guttenberg, the feckless recruit of
``Police Academy.''
   The obtuse combination, plus a captivating infant, helped make
Touchstone Picture's ``Three Men and a Baby'' the biggest
moneymaker of 1987.
   The three stars have reunited for ``Three Men and a Little
Lady,'' in which they play the concerned guardians of a 6-year-old,
played by a precocious Floridian named Robin Weisman.
   Selleck is a Californian who parlayed exposure as a Marlboro Man
into an acting career. Discovered as a guest star on ``The Rockford
Files,'' he played Magnum for eight years, winning an Emmy. His
films include ``High Road to China,'' ``Her Alibi'' and the current
``Quigley Down Under.''
   Brooklyn-born Guttenberg also won his start in commercials, then
attracted notice as one of the Baltimore buddies in ``Diner.'' He
starred in the hit series of ``Police Academy'' farces, as well as
in ``Cocoon,'' ``The Bedroom Window,'' ``Short Circuit'' and the TV
film ``The Day After.''
   Danson grew up near Flagstaff, Ariz., attended Stanford
University and graduated in drama from Carnegie Tech. After soap
operas and The New York Shakespeare Festival, he made his film
debut in ``The Onion Field.'' He recently began his ninth season on
the Emmy-winning ``Cheers.''
   The three actors sat down recently for a group interview with
The Associated Press. Here are the highlights:
   Q. How do you feel about sequels?
   Danson: I probably wouldn't choose to do one. But I did, and I
had a ball. I think we all felt, ``Why mess up a good thing by
doing a sequel?'' They (Touchstone) came up with a good idea.
   Selleck: I was real trepidatious about doing a sequel.
   Guttenberg: What?
   Selleck: Trepidatious. Obviously, there was financial incentive
involved, but that's the wrong reason to do a sequel. (``Three Men
and a Baby'') was a special thing for me, a landmark, and I think
it was for Steve and Ted. What I'm proudest of is that we all
worked real hard to make a better movie the second time.
   Guttenberg: I've had some sequels that worked, and some that
didn't. I'm thrilled that we came out with one that works - in our
opinion. When you do a sequel, you have a great responsibility to
the audience. You're telling them: ``You liked the first one, we're
going to fulfill another promise.'' You have to adhere to that
responsibility.
   Q. What about acting with children? Isn't that a no-no?
   Selleck: That's why we got a middle-aged kid to do the role.
Robin is actually 63 years old. Seriously, I don't think kids do
scene-stealing. I think everybody, including young actors and dogs,
make you look better.
   Q. Ted, you play a very self-absorbed actor in the film. Are
actors really like that?
   Danson: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I think the more mature you become,
you realize and recognize this neediness, and you're more at ease
with it. If you need a stroke, you just turn to the closest person
and say, ``I need a stroke.''
   Selleck: I think there's some truth in it, and that's why we
laugh at it.
   Guttenberg: I think self-interest is probably a healthy feeling
when it's taken in the right doses. But we can all get carried
away. What we want as actors is attention. If you keep it under
control and have a reality factor going on, it's OK.
   Q. What impelled you to become actors?
   Selleck: I don't know what impelled me. ... I was just going to
meander along with a management training program with United Air
Lines. I didn't have a desire to do a school play or perform,
except shooting spitwads behind the teacher's back. I was a bit
directionless in college, but I got lucky.
   Guttenberg: I went to college for a little while and dreams of
going into dentistry. I was drunk one night and talking to friend
about what we wanted to do. He said dentists made $80,000 a year,
and I said, ``That sounds good.'' I always wanted to tell stories,
and I sort of fell into it when I was a messenger. When I saw
envelopes filled with money at commercial agencies, I had a friend
take some photos, and I used them for auditions.
   Danson: I didn't even get close to a profession until acting
came along. ... Thank God I'm an actor. Boy, would I be a mess
without it!
   Q. If you had the power to change the movie industry, what would
you do?
   Guttenberg: I don't really know. I think the industry needs some
changes, and I think those changes come about because of necessity.
I wouldn't know. I'm just trying to make my way through it.
   Selleck: Seriously, I would keep the testing of motion pictures
at the level of a tool. I think it's rapidly becoming a sanitizer
of good controversial product. They get three bad preview cards and
say, ``Let's take that part out so we won't offend people.''
   I would also educate the public so they'd know there's a lot
more to films than the box-office score. When one film is in 2,000
theaters and another is in 800 theaters, people say, ``I'm going to
the one that's making all the money.''
   Danson: I think you should somehow stimulate writers, because
that's the beginning and the end of films.

   Billy Joel once epitomized the Angry Young Man he
sang about in the mid-1970s.
   Now, at age 41, he's still angry. He's also broke.
   Joel is almost a year into a 15-month world tour to promote his
triple-platinum ``Storm Front'' LP and get himself out of a sea of
red ink.
   Althouyh one of the biggest selling solo artists in the history
of Colombia Records - with 14 albums and 25 Top-40 singles in his
catalog, Joel has little financially to show for it.
   Still in litigation is a $90 million lawsuit he filed in
September 1989 against his former manager and brother-in-law Frank
Weber for fraud and breach-of-contract. The suit asks for $60
million in punitive damages and alleges that Weber duped Joel out
of $30 million, losing $10 million of it in unsafe investments.
   ``I haven't gotten a penny back yet,'' Joel said in an interview
before a recent sold-out concert here. ``The bulk of the lawsuit is
still with the lawyers.
   ``The reason for the length of this tour is financial. Look, at
this age, you don't want to go out on the road for fun and games.
When I started the tour, I was in deep financial straits. The
accounting firm I'm with now said I was looking at a deep, deep,
deep, deep financial hole that would take two years to get out of.
So I said, `OK,' and put my head down and went to work and I'm
getting back in the black.
   ``Am I angry about it? Bitter is a good word. The worst thing is
having to spend so much time away from my kid added Joel,'' who is
married to supermodel Christie Brinkley. They have a 4-year-old
daughter, Alexa Ray. ``When I was a kid, my dad was gone a lot and
I swore to myself that when I became a father, I'm going to be
home. So here I am - on the road, away from my kid.
   ``That's the thing that gets me the most. I'll make up the money
somehow. I'll make good on that. But the time spent away from my
kid isn't something you can make back. That's what I'm really
bitter about.''
   Joel is well aware that his cash-flow problems would be history
if he agreed to tour sponsorship, but the subject makes him
bristle.
   ``I'm not comfortable with it. Whatever celebrity I have was
given to me by people. To trade in on it would be a betrayal to
that,'' he said. ``Coke asked me. It was a lot of money. Millions
and millions of dollars. George Michael got that deal. Pepsi made
me an offer, I turned that down and Madonna got that deal.
   ``Part of me was saying to myself, `What are you, nuts? Take the
money!' The funny thing is, I actually drink the stuff. But I can't
really recommend it to other people.''
   If he did accept sponsorship, Joel is wary of another round of
bashing from some segments of the media. The five-time Grammy
winner said certain music critics have been on his back ever since
``The Stranger'' album produced four Top-20 singles in 1978.
   ``As soon as I started selling records, I was perceived in some
circles to be this commercial wunderkind, a tunesmith-balladeer, a
Tin Pan Alley man. You know, `Need a hit? Let me grind it out'
That's not how I write. Any hit I've had is an accident,'' he said.
   Born William Martin Joel, he grew up in Hicksville, N.Y., and
discovered Mozart at age 4 before taking 10 years of piano lessons.
   As a second-grader, Joel remembers watching Elvis Presley
perform on television one night and then trying to duplicate his
moves at school the next day.
   ``I got up on stage during lunch hour in the gym and did my
Elvis impersonation and the girls in the third grade started
screaming because I was shaking my hips and doing `Hound Dog.' The
teacher dragged me off the stage, thinking I had done something
really nasty. Hey, you don't even have hips in the second grade.
But I was thinking, `This is great.' I knew there was something to
this and it stayed with me,'' he said.
   ``When I saw the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show, I looked at
them and said, `That's it. That's what I want to do.' Those guys
didn't look like Frankie Avalon or Fabian. They wrote their own
songs, played their own instruments and they had the coolest hair
in the world.
   ``The first gig I did was when I was 15, in 1964. I played in a
band at Holy Family Church in Hicksville. Girls who wouldn't look
twice at me now liked me. At the end of the night, the priest came
over and gave us $5 each. You got PAID for this stuff. That locked
the backdoor. There was no way out for me. I was hooked.
   ``I didn't graduate from Hicksville High. Too many absences. I
was working until 3 o'clock in the morning in clubs. Who could wake
up at 7 o'clock?''
   In 1971, Joel was homeless, sleeping on laundromat floors and
surviving on peanut butter sandwiches when he signed a solo
recording contract with Family Productions.

   But his debut LP in 1972, ``Cold Spring Harbor,'' was mastered
at the wrong speed. So he played piano bars under the name Bill
Martin and gathered material for his hit debut album for Columbia -
``Piano Man'' - in 1973.
   His problems, however, were far from over.
   ``I signed away a lot of things in those early days,'' he said.
``I signed away publishing rights, copyrights, a lot of record
royalties. I tell you, I'm not a businessman. But I assumed in this
just land of ours that there's some law against indentured
servitude. You can't pay for a mistake for 20 years.''
   The on-going legal hassles are the main reason why Joel can't
help out other aspiring acts.
   ``People send me tapes all the time. They either want me to do
their material or they want to know what I think. I used to like
that. Now, I send them right back,'' he said. ``A laywer can say,
`Billy Joel used the word `the' in a song. Didn't you use the word
`the' in the song that you sent him? Hey, sue him!'
   ``It's a total defeat for the little guy because no one will
listen to their tapes now because of all these lawsuits,'' added
Joel, who once was unsuccessfully sued by someone who claimed he
wrote ``My Life,'' Joel's No. 1 single in 1978.
   ``Guys who do what I do, we don't need to steal. We write our
own stuff. All the music I write, I've dreamt. I dream music all
the time. I don't dream scenes and scenerios like most people do. I
dream abstractions - shapes, colors, sounds, symphonies. I wake up
and I don't remember what I dreamt, but it's in my subconscious
like a filing cabinet.
   ``When I sit down to write, I try to get into that filing
cabinet and once in a while, a little window or drawer will pop
open with the music in it and I'll be able to write it very
quickly.''
   The formula has produced a string of hits, including ``We Didn't
Start the Fire,'' which topped the charts earlier this year.
   The song, which featured a barrage of headline events over the
past 40 years, was widely used as a history-teaching tool for
junior high and high school students across the country.
   Joel's ``Storm Front'' tour began Dec. 6, 1989 in Worcester,
Mass., and is scheduled to end in March in New Zealand. By the time
it's over, he and his seven-piece band will have played 165 shows
to more than 3.5 million fans on five continents.
   On Dec. 5, he will take a one-day break from the tour and return
to New York City to receive a humanitarian award from the Cathedral
of St. John the Divine and a ``Grammy Legends'' award in a
television ceremony.
   Past humanitarian winners include Leonard Bernstein and Duke
Ellington. Joel will be honored as a ``Grammy Legend'' along with
three of his idols: Quincy Jones, Aretha Franklin and Johnny Cash.
``How does a little pup like me get in there? It's wild.
   ``I'd like to be remembered as a writer. I believe in the stuff
I've written. Those are the things that really end up being your
legacy. I'm not a showman and I don't really feel like I'm an
entertainer.''
   But Joel can relate to his past and shakes his head in disbelief
over all he's survived.
   His father left home when Joel was 7, he considered suicide and
checked himself into a mental institution in his early 20s,
fractured his right wrist and left thumb in a 1982 motorcycle
accident that put his career in jeopardy, and was divorced in 1982
after a nine-year marriage to Elizabeth Weber. His nose still shows
signs of the 26 amateur fights he had at age 19.
   ``It always amazes me, the resilience of human beings. It's
unbelievable. But I'm happy to be anywhere,'' he said with a laugh.
   ``I'm as old as a '49 Studebaker. Ever look at a car from 1949?
The steel is all rusted out, the body is all dented and falling
apart, the upholstery is all ripped and the engine doesn't work.
   ``I look in the mirror and say, `Well, you ain't Cary Grant but
you ain't in the junkyard, either.' But I'm happy with my life.
Very happy. It's nothing at all like I pictured it would be.''

<TEXT>
   Today's generation of Selma blacks take integration for granted
and view Bloody Sunday as something from long ago that they learn
about during Black History Month, like slavery.
   And yet, not unlike cities of all sizes in every region, Selma
still feels the ache of what has become a national migraine reduced
to a single syllable. Race.
   Black eligible voters in Selma and Dallas County now outnumber
whites, barely. Under Smitherman, Selma has gerrymandered its wards
so that four blacks and four whites sit on the city council. The
council president, elected at-large, is currently white. Council
members have an unwritten agreement that a person of the same race
will be appointed to replace any one of them leaving office in
midterm.
   Very often in Selma, seemingly neutral issues that come before
the council are resolved along racial lines. Many chalk it up to
the city's heritage of confrontation. It seems to have left Selma
as fragile as a house of cards, the whole town hoping nobody will
bump the table.
   Somehow Smitherman has managed to keep the balance, to walk the
tightrope as he says, without losing control.
   ``Joe Smitherman is a man of great cunning,'' says the Rev. Fred
Reese. ``He knows how to manipulate the white people to accept
changes that will benefit the black people - and them too, really.
He knows just how far to go and still keep white support without
losing black support.''
   Reese is the principal of Selma High School. Back in 1964 he was
the head of the Dallas County Voter's League, the person who lured
Martin Luther King to Selma for the voting rights crusade. He was
also one of the few blacks who managed to register to vote despite
the obstacles of the time. In the 1964 mayor's race he voted for
Smitherman.
   ``Joe and I are the same age. We grew up in the same part of
town in similar circumstances,'' said Reese. ``Blacks can identify
with him.''
   For the 30 years before Smitherman ran there hadn't been a real
race for mayor. Selma's ruling gentry passed the office from one of
their number to the next, like a fiefdom. The only requirement was
to keep things as is.
   Smitherman, then, was a brash upstart. He was a gawky young
appliance salesman with a long neck and big ears and no friends at
the country club. He managed to get elected to the city council,
where he became a royal pain. He wanted to do city business in the
open, for example, instead of the back room. Brash.
   He ran for mayor pledging to represent ``all the people, not the
favored few,'' and his campaign flyers underlined the word ``all.''
   ``I figured everybody had a favored few they didn't like,'' he
said. ``I was right. When I won, the old guard wouldn't even give
me a key to city hall. I had to get one made.''
   The civil rights demonstrations behind him, Smitherman became
the busiest man in town. He pushed through a penny sales tax and
did things people could see and touch - paved and lighted streets,
new garbage trucks, fire engines, sewer lines.
   He became an expert at wheedling money out of Washington, money
the old guard shunned as ``tainted,'' inviting federal
interference.
   ``Only thing tainted about it,'' Smitherman told them, ``is
t'aint enough of it.''
   And more visible and touchable things appeared, each new project
overlapping the last, new libraries, new city hall, new housing
projects, schools, museums, fountains, trees and flowers and parks.
   Train crossings were a hazard. He stopped a 180-car freight with
a police car and ticketed the conductor for blocking streets. The
railroad rescheduled.
   He refused to pay the city's electric bill until the power
company explained its ``pass-on charges'' so the people could know
what they were paying for.
   When Ku Klux Klansmen showed up on the city hall steps he called
them ``white trash'' and ran them out of town. Blacks applauded. He
padlocked the anti-poverty office because only 5 percent of the
paid employees were white. Not enough. Whites applauded.
   At the 20th anniversary observance of Bloody Sunday, Smitherman
went to the pulpit of Brown Chapel, where Martin Luther King had
preached, and said, ``My hands are as dirty as the others. We were
wrong. I'm sorry.'' He shared a hymnal with Jesse Jackson and sang
``We Shall Overcome.''
   ``I suppose I've been the most visible person in the state short
of the governor,'' Smitherman said, ``and a lot of people expected
me to run for higher office.
   ``When I was younger I gave some thought to it but after a few
terms I discovered it's hard for mayors to do that.
   ``Mayors can't duck issues or avoid taking sides. For mayors,
the public is as close as the sidewalk. You either get the garbage
picked up or you don't. You either remove the dangerous tree or you
don't. You can't tell an angry citizen that you'll have a committee
look into it, not if you want to get re-elected.
   ``Also, you need what I call the Big Mules, the money boys who
finance your campaign and don't let you forget where you got the
money. I've shifted around so much politically, backing Democrats,
Republicans, whatever, that the Big Mules who know me could never
be sure if I'd stay hitched.
   ``Anyhow, Selma is all I really care about and being mayor of
Selma has been sufficient. Two more years and I'm history.''

<BYLINE>``NBC Nightly News'': New Look, New Boss, New Graphic Changes
^By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Steve Friedman took over as executive
producer of the third-place ``NBC Nightly News,'' one staffer
recalls he spoke in dire terms of doom, maybe the end of the show,
if he didn't succeed.
   The message wasn't that strong, Friedman says of that June staff
meeting.
   ``But I said that if we didn't change what we did, or how we did
it, there was no hope ... to survive in the long haul,'' he says.
   When NBC News President Michael Gartner introduced the brash,
shoot-from-the-lip Friedman at the NBC affiliates' meeting in June,
he called him a ``show doctor'' who would ``make `Nightly'
sparkle.''
   Then came a vow from Friedman: ``We are going to do a show of
interest, not the show of record.''
   As traditionalists shuddered, he went to work, having earlier
put NBC's ``Today'' on top when he was its executive producer, then
foaled a $40 million syndicated bomb, ``USA Today: The Television
Show.''
   His ``Nightly'' priority: ``To make the program more lively,
more active than passive.''
   That included more live interviews, he said, reports that
weren't a day-later echo of those in major newspapers, and even
entertainment news.
   In one of the most noticeable changes, he installed an array of
graphics - TV headlines - which critics said he'd used to wild
excess on his failed effort at a TV version of USA Today.
   Some graphics on the new-look ``Nightly'' are sedate, no
flashier than those on ABC's first-place ``World News Tonight.''
   But others ... well, in a recent broadcast, one report on the
troubles of Eastern Airlines carried a mystifying graphic: ``Goin'
South,'' it said. A story on prevention of child abuse was entitled
``Kid Protection.'' And the show's final report, on the auction of
Greta Garbo's goods, was headlined: ``Going, Going Garbo.''
   Several ``Nightly'' staffers who asked not to be identified -
he's the boss, after all - said Friedman is ``USA Today-ing'' NBC's
show.
   Nonsense, he responded, he's not taking time away from the news.
``The purists have had their run on these shows for a long time and
the audience has spoken,'' he added. ``There's no honor in going
out of business.''
   ``I don't think our graphics are any more `USA Today' than CBS
or ABC,'' said Tom Brokaw, the ``Nightly'' anchor and managing
editor.
   ``I think it adds a real television vitality to it that I
certainly welcomed, and I think most people do as well,'' he said,
including what he called ``high-church journalists.''
   Brokaw's new producer is not what you'd call Traditional
Executive. In the December Esquire magazine, a report on the new
``Nightly News'' includes a picture of Friedman, his head in an
empty TV set he's holding. He appears to be yelling.
   Friedman returned to NBC at a tough time for network evening
newscasts.
   In the 1979-80 season, just before the onslaught of Cable News
Network and when local newscasts were expanding, the evening
newscasts of CBS, NBC and ABC had a combined 77 percent share of
the national audience.
   Six weeks into the current season, the combined figure was 57
percent.
   Brokaw, whose ties with Friedman go back 20 years, when both
worked at KNBC-TV in beautiful downtown Burbank, concedes that to a
certain extent ``Nightly'' is ceding to CNN and local newscasts
some types of breaking news.
   The program ``can't be above the news ... and if there's a
go-to-hell fire of some kind or flooding in the Northwest, we're
going to touch on that,'' he said. ``But it's not the staple it
once was.
   ``We have to be more analytical. We have to be ahead of the
curve on the news, do the kinds of stories that will prepare the
audience for the next wave of change in their lives.''
   Brokaw doesn't think it's last-gasp time for his show or its
rivals, despite financial crunches at network news divisions and
the insistence by the networks' bottom-line managements that these
divisions earn money.
   But ``obviously we can't go through the precipitous decline that
we've gone through in audience share the last 10 years,'' he said.
   Stopping that drop was Friedman's mandate when, in a surprise
move in May, Gartner named him to succeed the program's former
executive producer, Bill Wheatley, now director of NBC's political
coverage.
   ``As we used to say in the trade, you have o stop the bleeding
before you can fix the patient,'' Friedman said. ``And we had to
stop that downslide where this program was a consistent falling
third.''
   He thinks that's been done. But the verdict isn't in yet.
   Since Friedman took over, ``Nightly'' has continued to battle
Dan Rather's ``CBS Evening News'' for second place. ABC's
broadcast, anchored by Peter Jennings, has consistently led the
ratings pack.
   The pugnacious Friedman professes not to worry about ``where we
are with Dan Rather, because I've dismissed Dan Rather as a threat
to us. I worry about where we are with Peter Jennings.''
   As part of the ``Nightly'' revamp, Friedman began in September
what he calls ``the daily difference'' - daily segments on the
family, what works in America, health issues, guns and drugs and,
on Friday, a follow-up report on some major story.
   He readily admits it's what he calls a ``variation'' on the
2-year-old ``American Agenda'' segments of ABC's ``World News
Tonight,'' a program he admires.
   He makes no apologies for adding more reports on sports - issues
or personalities - and entertainment to the show's mix:
   ``I believe part of our job is to talk about what people do and
the culture of the country ... and I think that's more important
than some Senate committee hearing on some topic that will never
get voted on.''
   What he's done so far with ``Nightly'' has its critics. But they
don't include one key NBC affiliate executive who in the past has
been critical of NBC News' failings: Eric Bremner, now president of
the NBC affiliates' board.
   ``My reaction to the changes is positive,'' said Bremner,
president of King Broadcasting Co. in Seattle. ``I think we see
progress in acceptance of the show. ... I think they're on an
upward trend.''
   On a relatively slow news day this month, ``Nightly'' opened
with more than seven nonstop minutes devoted to various aspects of
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   But its show-closing final moment - little cartoon sketches now
sometimes signal the end of a broadcast - indicated another change
in the once-traditional newscast.
   Longer than most of the that's-all-folks notices on ``Nightly,''
it took 29 seconds, which no doubt agonized correspondents known to
go bonkers when told to cut, say, just 15 seconds from their piece.
   Pegged to a preceding report on the Garbo auction, it was a clip
from one of the late star's films. In it, Garbo, accused by her
escort of lacking humor, laughs hysterically when he accidentally
tips over in his chair.
   His huffy reaction: ``What's so funny about this?''
   On that note, that evening's edition of the new-look ``NBC
Nightly News'' concluded.

<HEAD>Talking About America's Most Popular Illegal Drug: Marijuana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ruth knows that smoking marijuana, once
virtually ignored by the public and police, is now considered ``a
very deviant thing. It's very taboo.''
   The 40-something San Francisco professional is married, has
children and a respectable job. She knows that even though
California's marijuana law is still relatively lenient, a drug bust
could threaten her livelihood.
   Yet she still smokes high-grade sinsemilla several times a week.
   Why?
   ``It's a very nice high,'' she said. ``Often in these drug
stories, people forget to mention that part.''
   Ruth is far from alone. Marijuana is the most popular illegal
drug today, the crack epidemic notwithstanding.
   Perhaps as a result, most states arrest more people for
marijuana than for cocaine and heroin combined, government
statistics show. Last year, almost 400,000 people were busted on
some kind of marijuana charge.
   The drug's popularity stems in part from the fact that it is a
known quantity - almost 66 million Americans have tried it at least
once, many of them during its heyday in the 1960s and 1970s. The
1988 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that 6.6 million
Americans used it once a week or more and 11.6 million had used it
in the previous month.
   It is considered relatively safe. Today's marijuana may be far
stronger than its counterpart a decade ago, as the government says,
but Harvard psychiatrist Lester Grinspoon notes there is ``no
reliable evidence of death caused by cannabis in a human being.''
   And it's relatively cheap. John, a scientist who uses sinsemilla
several evenings a week, says one ounce lasts him six months. That
ounce could cost as little as $100 and the same amount of
lower-grade marijuana can run $40.
   Other drugs - especially cocaine and heroin - are associated
with high crime and violence. And nationally, police officers
arrest far more people on cocaine or heroin charges than any other
illegal drug.
   But in some states, nearly every drug arrest involves marijuana
- 86 percent in Vermont, for example, 82 percent in North Dakota
and 81 percent in Maine, according to FBI figures for 1988.
   Eight of every 10 marijuana busts is for possession of the drug,
the FBI says.
   The reason so many people are arrested on marijuana charges
seems obvious to one group - the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws, which has advocated marijuana
legalization for two decades.
   Marijuana users ``are easier targets'' than, say, cocaine
traffickers, said NORML spokesman John Dunlap. ``They're a much
more passive lot. The government knows it's an easy public
relations victory.''
   Dunlap also contends there are just more marijuana smokers out
there - he estimates 30 million people use it once a week, far more
than the government estimate of 6.6 million.
   Many police departments that once paid little attention to
marijuana users have changed as attitudes harden toward all illegal
drugs. An example is Arizona's Maricopa County, which includes
Phoenix.
   ``The cops basically sort of ignored it'' a few years ago, said
Bill FitzGerald, spokesman for County Attorney Richard Romley.
   Today, the county boasts a ``Do Drugs, Do Time'' program
targeting all drug users.
   ``Every arrested person will be booked into jail for at least a
few hours,'' said Romley and County Sheriff Thomas Agnos in a paper
describing the program. For a casual user, even a brief jail stint
``drives home the gravity of the offense.''
   First-time offenders may enter a diversion program and,
according to FitzGerald's figures, three-quarters of the people who
did had been arrested on marijuana charges.
   Across America, government agencies have staged widely
publicized raids on outdoor marijuana fields, indoor growing labs
and stores that sell equipment for such labs in an attempt to
curtail domestic crops that provide an estimated 25 percent of the
U.S. supply.
   The government admits it conducts these raids in large part to
impress a foreign audience.
   ``We cannot expect foreign countries to undertake vigorous
anti-drug efforts inside their borders if we ourselves fail to do
likewise,'' says the National Drug Control Strategy issued in
January.
   Perhaps another reflection of changing attitudes about drugs,
laws themselves are becoming more stringent.
   Of the 11 states that decriminalized marijuana possession for
personal use during the 1970s, four have reversed course in recent
years.
   Alaska, which had actually legalized possession of up to four
ounces at home or other private places, voted Nov. 6 to make
possession of small amounts a crime again.
   Maine, Ohio and Oregon had already tightened marijuana
restrictions. But in seven other states - California, Colorado,
Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nebraska and New York - a
marijuana arrest is more akin to a traffic ticket than a criminal
charge.
   William J. Bennett, who resigned after 20 months as national
drug control policy director, championed the stricter attitude and
campaigned for Alaska's marijuana measure.
   Although Bennett told The Associated Press last December that he
believed marijuana was no more harmful than alcohol, he rejected
legalization: ``The last thing I would want to do is recommend the
wider use of a drug that makes young people stupid.''
   Despite the increased risks, many longtime marijuana smokers
cannot imagine giving it up.
   John, the scientist who asked that his real name not be used,
said a single puff of sinsemilla ``facilitates the imagination and
has allowed occasional creative breakthroughs,'' some of whch have
led to ``papers published in reputable journals.''
   His employers do not require random drug tests, but if they did,
``That would be enough of an insult to my freedom that I would quit
and contribute to the brain drain,'' said John, who is single.
   Steven, a 34-year-old Massachusetts attorney and father of two,
said, ``If I didn't use it, I think I'd be an alcohol abuser.''
Alcohol would hurt his health far more, he said.
   Steven, who did not want his last name used, recognizes the
legal dangers, but believes he would face only a reprimand, not
disbarment, if he were arrested on marijuana charges.
   To Ruth, who also did not want her last name used, marijuana is
``the best aphrodisiac there is.'' Alcohol is not an acceptable
substitute.
   ``You get drunk with alcohol,'' she said. ``You get sloppy. And
the next day you have a hangover. The worst that can happen with
marijuana is you get sleepy.''

   Federal regulators gave preferential treatment
as far back as the mid-1980s to some troubled savings and loans
whose executives sat on regional regulatory boards, a document
indicates.
   Such favoritism discouraged bank examiners and slowed
recognition of the magnitude of the financial troubles of S&amp;Ls,
Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said at a congressional hearing.
   The House Budget Committee's Task Force on Urgent Fiscal Issues
released a summary Tuesday of a 1988 government review of the
Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, which was responsible for
regulating S&amp;Ls in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and New
Mexico.

   CHICAGO (AP) - The U.S. Energy Department has found no evidence
of fuel price gouging by American oil companies in the wake of
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the agency's No. 2 man told oil
executives.
   ``If anything, there has been a lack of profits that should have
been made and prices that should have been charged for gasoline,''
Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore said in a speech Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, gasoline prices continued their climb this week, with
the average price of self-serve regular unleaded up almost a penny
a gallon since last week, the American Automobile Association
reported.

many economists contend is further confirmation the economy is in a

manufacturing. That accounted for a fourth of the overall decline,
the largest since a 1 percent drop in January.

suit on behalf of Stone and the government was filed July 5, 1989,

   NEW YORK (AP) - Creditors of Eastern Airlines say that it cannot
become viable, so they want to sell whatever assets remain and
close the final chapter in the tortuous legacy of the
strike-plagued moneylosing airline.
   In a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the creditors of
Miami-based Eastern said they oppose the airline's request to get
$30 million out of an escrow account to keep operating through the
middle of next month.
   Eastern rejected the creditors' contentions, saying it would
present full arguments in a hearing on Wednesday afternoon.

   When the Wall Street recession gobbled
her high-powered marketing job in New York City, Sara Lewis packed
her skis and headed for the mountains of northern New England.
   Not for recreation, but a new career.
   As the ski season gets under way, New England's largest ski
resorts are swamped with employment applications from professionals
who lost jobs in the ``yuppie recession'' sweeping the financial
services and computer industries.
   As they comb through employment applications for the coming
season, resort officials are marveling at the qualifications and
skills possessed by many of those seeking jobs that pay a fraction
of their former salaries.
   ``We've had an overwhelming number of applications, quite a
number of them from professional people wanting jobs at seasonal
wages,'' said Kirby Goode, a personnel assistant at Vermont's
Sugarbush resort.
   Applicants include engineers and other professionals laid off at
General Electric Co. in Burlington, Vt., and ``banking people from
Maine, Boston, New York, all over the Northeast,'' Goode said.
   ``I heard about a fellow who had worked in the high-tech
business around Route 128 in Boston and he was begging for a job
working with the ski school,'' said Kathe Dillmann of Waterville
Valley in New Hampshire.
   Ms. Lewis lucked out when she applied at Sugarloaf-USA. A vice
president of a design and marketing firm until its biggest client,
Merrill Lynch, retrenched, she was expecting a laborer's job at the
Maine resort.
   But she got a full-time job in the marketing department,
allowing her to live in the country, ski all she wants - and use
some of her professional skills.
   ``I was planning on being a lift attendant if that's what I had
to do this winter,'' she said. ``I have a good marketing
background, and it's a lot more fun marketing skiing than marketing
mutual funds or limited partnerships.''
   The new jobs are an adjustment for the displaced professionals.
For some it's like joining the circus, a chance to indulge in a
sport they previously could only enjoy on vacations or weekends.
   But the drop in pay can be as precipitous as the toughest
slopes. Lift operators at Sunday River start at $5.25 to $5.50 an
hour, while most jobs at Sugarloaf range from $2 an hour plus tips
for serving food to $7 or $8 an hour for veterans at snowmaking.
   Even with a blue-chip resume, there's some tough competition to
overcome.
   Sunday River, for example, gets 100 applicants a week for 500
seasonal jobs. Sugarloaf's annual job fair last weekend drew more
than 400 applicants, although the resort estimates it will need
fewer than 100 new employees.
   But resort officials see it as a ``win-win'' situation. They say
a seasonal stint on the slopes gives displaced workers a chance to
sort out their lives and mull their utures, while the resorts can
pick and choose from a personnel pool that's well-qualified and
easily trained.
   ``This is very exciting for us because the quality of the
applicants is just overwhelming,'' said Nancy Marshall, a
spokeswoman at Sugarloaf.
   The resorts, meanwhile, are optimistic the bad times that are
helping employment won't hurt other aspects of their business.
   ``Curiously, that same economic slump does not seem to pose any
kind of problem for us,'' said Skip King of Sunday River. ``Our
vacation bookings are up considerably and our season ticket sales
are right where they should be.''

   Federal regulators have renewed their
conflict-of-interest allegations against Neil Bush, summing up
their case against the president's son in a document submitted to
an administrative law judge.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision, in a brief filed with
Administrative Law Judge Daniel J. Davidson, reiterated its
position that Bush's business relationships conflicted with his
role as a former director of a failed Colorado savings and loan.
   Bush, for his part, continues to insist that he committed no
wrongdoing in voting to approve loans to developers Kenneth Good
and Bill Walters, who invested in Bush's oil company. In addition,
Bush told Davidson in his brief, ``there is no likelihood that the
alleged unsafe or unsound practices will continue.''
   The two sides submitted briefs Monday to Davidson, who will make
a recommendation in the case. The documents were made available by
the OTS on Tuesday.
   Bush, 35, breached his duty to shareholders and depositors of
Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver, and
engaged in other ``unsafe or unsound'' practices, the OTS said in
its 56-page brief.
   The thrift agency is seeking an administrative order against
Bush that could lead to barring him from the banking and savings
industry. The regulators contend that Bush failed to adequately
inform fellow Silverado directors of his business ties with Good
and Walters, who eventually defaulted on more than $132 million in
loans from Silverado.
   Davidson held an administrative hearing in Denver in late
September, at which both Bush and government witnesses testified.
The judge will examine the testimony from the hearing as well as
the latest briefs submitted by both sides and is expected to
recommend by Jan. 2 what sanctions, if any, should be taken against
Bush.
   OTS Director Timothy Ryan is scheduled to make a decision in
early April, and Bush would have the right to appeal it to a
federal court.
   ``Bush has evinced no recognition that his conduct was
improper,'' the OTS brief states. ``His conduct is capable of being
resumed at another institution.''
   The OTS repeated its charge, for example, that Bush violated his
duties to Silverado by doing ``everything in his power'' - short of
voting to approve it - to procure a $900,000 line of credit from
Silverado to a partnership formed by Bush and Good to explore for
oil and gas in Argentina. The credit line, intended to convince
Argentine officials that the venture had strong financial
resources, was never used.
   Under questioning from a government attorney at the Denver
hearing, Bush said lawyers for Good's company suggested that Bush
present the credit line proposal to Silverado's board.
   ``I was a go-between,'' Bush said at the hearing.
   He maintained there was no conflict in his role because he
didn't stand to gain any financial benefit from the credit line,
which he described as a sort of ``letter of referral,'' and because
he abstained from voting on the proposal.
   Pressed by the government attorney, however, Bush later admitted
he had hoped the partnership would eventually benefit from the
credit line, since it would persuade the Argentine government to
permit the venture to drill wells in that country.
   In his new brief, Bush said he presented the credit line request
to the Silverado board because it was not to be funded or drawn
upon. Bush said he would not have presented the proposal if it had
involved funding the credit line.
   In addition to the government's conflict-of-interest case, Bush
also faces a $200 million negligence lawsuit filed against him and
other former Silverado directors by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.

   Eastern Airlines and its creditors were at odds
today over a multimillion-dollar cash infusion that would keep the
troubled airline flying into December.
   The creditors argued in U.S. Bankruptcy Court that Eastern
cannot become viable. They want to sell the remaining assets and
close the final chapter in the tortuous legacy of the
strike-plagued carrier.
   Their opinion is in a court filing, made Tuesday in reponse to
Miami-based Eastern's request to withdraw $30 million from an
escrow account to keep operating through the middle of next month.
   Eastern rejected the creditors' contentions, saying it would
present full arguments in a hearing late this afternoon before U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland.
   Eastern has been protected from creditors, operating under
Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code since March 1989 when the airline
was crippled by a strike. The company has been flying with
nonstrikers and replacements, and repeatedly has sought to win
understanding from creditors for more time to become profitable.
   But the creditors, who range from aircraft giants like Airbus
Industrie and Boeing to mom-and-pop travel agencies, have grown
increasingly frustrated and impatient about getting at least some
of their money.
   Their fears have been heightened amid an uncertain economic
environment marked by rising fuel prices and sluggish demand for
air travel.
   The unsecured creditors committee, made up of the 12 largest
creditors of Eastern, said it will file a liquidation plan, and if
necessary, seek to force the airline into Chapter 7 bankruptcy
proceedings so assets can be sold.
   ``The committee regrettably but firmly takes this position after
thoroughly deliberating and weighing all of the facts and
alternatives, and after supporting Eastern's effort to reorganize
for more than 20 months,'' said the filing signed by creditors
attorney Joel B. Zweibel.
   Eastern has been losing some $1 million a day. But
court-appointed trustee Martin R. Shugrue Jr. has predicted the
losses can be turned around early next year. Eastern nonetheless
said it needs another infusion of cash to stay in business.
   ``We feel that in all respects the money is justified because
Eastern right now is showing the strongest recovery trend since the
strike began,'' spokesman Jim Ashlock said Tuesday.
   Creditors disagreed.
   ``Eastern is not, and is not likely to become under any
realistic scenario, a viable stand-alone airline,'' the unsecured
creditors committee said. The court filing went on to say that the
creditors ``are the owner of this airline and firmly believe that
the airline should be closed; their representative, the trustee, as
a matter of law and equity, should be required to abide by their
wishes.''
   Airlines have been hit hard the past three months by fuel prices
that skyrocketed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August. The
Eastern creditors said that if oil prices stay in the $35 per
barrel range, Eastern will lose between another $88.2 million and
123.4 million in November and December.
   The creditors said Shugrue's claims that Eastern can be made
viable by early next year are based on an unrealistic assumption
that oil prices will fall to about $30 per barrel. Even if that
happens, the creditors said, Eastern would only break even for the
year.

   Michael Milken, in an emotional letter to his
sentencing judge, acknowledged his crimes and pleaded for the
opportunity to rebuild his life - but not in the securities
industry.
   ``My priorities today are different,'' Milken said in the
11-page letter to U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood. ``It's hard for
me to conceive of ever having the desire to enter into a commercial
transaction again. I don't see that changing in the near future.''
   Milken, the former head of the high-yield junk bond division of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said he wrote the letter because he
would be unable emotionally to speak at his sentencing.
   The letter was the first time Milken publicly described his
feelings during the government's four-year investigation of his
activities at Drexel.
   ``I allowed myself to get too caught up in what I was doing to
consider the consequences or to stop myelf from doing what I knew
was wrong. For that I am truly sorry and ashamed,'' Milken said.
``I did break our nation's laws.''
   Milken said he wanted to testify at a pre-sentencing hearing but
that he followed his attorneys' advice not to, ``even though it was
terribly difficult and frustrating sitting in the courtroom and not
being able to speak.''
   His letter, dated Nov. 5, was filed in court Tuesday after
portions were deleted to protect the privacy of Milken's children.
   Milken, who pleaded guilty to six felony counts earlier this
year, faces up to 28 years in prison. A date for his sentencing has
not been set, but it is expected to take place later this week or
early next week.
   While Milken did not specifically ask to be spared a prison
sentence, he spoke of his fear of incarceration and his desire to
continue working with disadvantaged children.
   Much of the rambling letter was about Milken's love for his
family and the loss of privacy he and his wife, Lori, and children
experienced during the past several years.
   ``Let me return to a life of anonymity if humanly possible for
myself and my family,'' he said. ``I think I can accomplish more by
blending back into society and quietly seeing what I can do.''
   Milken also claimed he had been falsely represented as a symbol
of the greed and power that swept the financial world during the
1980s.
   ``I am a person, not a symbol,'' he said. ``I, like other
individuals, have strong beliefs and ideals and as I have
acknowledged by my plea before your honor, I have made mistakes.''
   Milken described how his life's work had been based on a belief
that he could improve the society and initiate change by making
capital available to those who previously had no access.
   ``I went to Wall Street with the desire to help change society
for the better, not to find a fortune,'' he said.
   But the insider trading scandal resulted in a different public
perception, Milken acknowledged.
   ``I have been forced to face the challenge that not only am I
portrayed as a fraud, but everything my life stood for is called a
fraud and all the principles I have spoken about my whole life are
hollow,'' he said. ``At times, this has been almost too difficult
to bear.''
   He described his recent activities with disadvantaged children
in the Los Angeles area and asked to be allowed to continue his
work there.
   ``I recognize that because of what I did, going forward with my
life will always be one of walking around with the label of
admitted felon,'' he said. ``I recognize I must conduct myself by
the standards that I believe in ... 100 percent of the time. Now, I
recognize that by accomplishing less, I might even accomplish
more.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Wall Street Journal is closing its
Philadelphia news bureau to save money and plans to either transfer
or layoff the office's 10 news workers.
   A union official said six reporters would lose their jobs.
   Roger May, a spokesman for Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., which publishes
the Journal, said he could not confirm the contention of the union,
the Independent Association of Publishers' Employees, that six will
be laid off.
   The Philadelphia bureau will by closed at the end of the year,
the company said Tuesday.
   Dow Jones and other media companies are suffering through an
advertising slump that has prompted widespread cost-cutting in the
industry. Dow Jones recently announced a 17.5 percent drop in
third-quarter profit, reflecting declining ad linage and the costly
acquisition of the financial information service Telerate Inc.
   Dow Jones believes it can maintain the same quality of news
coverage by transferring stories handled by the Philadelphia office
to the New York staff, May said.
   The president of the 1,800-member union, Ronald Chen, disagreed.
   ``Obviously, some things have to be affected, but they're
willing to take that trade-off,'' Chen said. Quality will suffer
``unless they're going to tell you people who are working 10 or 11
hours a day can heap two hours on top of that.''
   Dow Jones has no plans to close any of its remaining 13 domestic
news bureaus, May said. But Chen said editorial employees had
become concerned about their job security.
   ``If they can close a bureau like Philadelphia, other bureaus
might be being looked at,'' Chen said.
   Dow Jones has offered older editorial staffers a ``buyout
package'' that is available until Nov. 30, Chen said. The union was
advising workers against accepting the deal, which Chen called ``a
very lowball offer to get people out the door.''
   In another cost-cutting move, May said Dow Jones plans to
relocate certain overseas editors to consolidate all copy editing
in New York. Some of the overseas workers, particularly foreign
nationals, will likely lose their jobs, he said.
   The company also will close its newspaper composing operation in
Naperville, Ill., leaving the paper with three other sites for
newspaper makeup around the nation. Chen said that closing and
other recent layoffs had cost 46 employees their jobs.
   May was unable to give precise figures for layoffs or the
potential savings from the cost reductions.

   The personal computer of 1995 will recognize
its owner's handwriting and voice and display crystal clear, 3-D
images on a thin, flat screen, computer experts predict.
   It also will be smaller and lighter than today's machines. In
fact, it may be so portable it may be carried by users everywhere
they go, much like an appointment book, a panel of indusry
officials predicted Tuesday at the weeklong Comdex computer show.
   In addition, the 1995 models will be in constant contact with
the rest of the world through built-in cellular phone or radio
hookups, enabling them to send and receive messages as well as news
reports, faxes and documents.
   In case that sounds like a delirious dream, consider how far
computers have come in the past five years - the power of the
processor chips at the heart of the machines has increased
exponentially, today's screens produce sharp color images instead
of black and white, and many portable models already fit into a
briefcase, though they lack the power predicted for the future
machines.
   Dan Bricklin, who co-invented the first computer spreadsheet,
VisiCalc, believes the computer keyboard will go the way of the
computer punchcard.
   ``It will be as quaint as people who use calligraphy pens,'' he
quipped. ``The keyboard will be considered an accessory in the
future.''
   Bricklin is so confident that handwriting recognition will be
the way many computers take in information, he started a software
company to develop programs for the machines.
   So far only a few rudimentary handwriting-based computers are on
the market. One, sold by Grid Systems Corp., a subsidiary of Tandy
Corp., is a flat 4{-pound handheld device that resembles an
Etch-A-Sketch. It recognizes numbers and capital block letters
written with a special pen on its screen.
   Among sample uses for the Grid machine shown at Comdex are an
entry-order system for food companies that supply supermarkets and
an electronic accident report for police.
   With the retail order form, the user writes in the quantity of
various products using the special pen. The computer then
reproduces the figures in its own typeface.
   With the accident report, the officer writes his name and the
computer reproduces it. The officer then depicts the accident scene
by selecting from various road diagrams, traffic signs and
vehicles, all represented by pictures that can be moved when the
pen is touched to the computer screen. The reoprt later can be
printed on almost any computer porinter.
   As computers become smaller, the keyboard becomes impractical,
said Robert Carr, of Go Corp., which also is developing software
for handwriting-based machines.
   ``The keyboards don't shrink down very well,'' he said. ``You
have to file your fingertips to a tiny point.''
   Bricklin believes handwriting recognition will be combined with
voice recognition to virtually replace keyboards.
   He showed a videotape of two voice recognition systems already
on the market. One can be used by doctors to enter patient records
into a computer. It recognizes a limited vocabulary of medical
terms. The other device can draw certain objects on a Macintosh
computer screen by recognizing words for certain objects, such as
``circle.''
   While neither is very sophisticated, Bricklin said they are a
vast improvement over machines of a few years ago.
   Carr believes keyboardless computers will be more socially
acceptable. He said keyboard-based portable computers can seem
intrusive, while a pen-based computer is similar to taking notes on
a pad. That will make them more practical when they are toted
around to meetings or other social situations.
   Part of the advancement in personal computers will be enabled by
vastly more powerful microprocessors, the experts said. By 1995,
the chips used in personal machines will exceed the power of
today's room-sized mainframe computers, they said.

   Regulators are overreacting to the savings
and loan crisis and risk deepening the current real estate
recession, according to experts appearing at the thrift industry's
annual convention.
   Bank and S&amp;L executives began complaining more than a year ago
of a shortage of credit induced by regulators in New England. The
complaints spread as teams of examiners worked their way through
institutions in the mid-Atlantic states, Florida and more recently
in California.
   Regulators, in forcing banks and S&amp;Ls to establish reserves
against possible future losses, maintained they simply were
responding prudently to a weakening economy.
   But two real estate experts addressing the 98th annual
convention of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions said Tuesday
it is now time to ease up or risk making the situation worse.
   ``If you're a lender, this is not a recession, this is close to
a depression,'' said Kenneth T. Rosen, chairman of the real estate
center at the University of California-Berkeley.
   Rosen called on the Bush administration to address the problem
with a high-level meeting of Treasury Department officials and
financial institution regulators. He said institutions with problem
real estate loans should be permitted to absorb the losses over
several years.
   The approach worked in the mid-1980s when problems emerged for
large banks that had made loans to Third World countries, he said.
   Anthony Downs, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, a
Washington think tank, took a softer tone, saying regulators were
forced to crack down hard on real estate lending because bankers
ignored earlier milder warnings.
   He said a near-total ban is probably warranted on new lending
for commercial projects because so many of them are vacant, but
added that regulators should soften their stance toward loans to
home builders.
   Remarks from the two drew applause at the convention, which is
closing today with the installation of Donald Shackelford, a
Columbus, Ohio, thrift executive, as the league's new chairman.
   Speakers at the meeting say real estate problems likely will get
worse before they get better.
   Rosen is predicting only 900,000 units of housing will be built
next year, a two-decade low. Lynn Michaelis, chief economist of
Weyerhauser Company, a lumber corporation, is forecasting 1.05
million units and Martin Perlman, president of the National
Association of Home Builders, expects 1.15 million.
   Federal Reserve policymakers, who held a closed-door meeting
Tuesday in Washington, were expected by economists to approve a
slightly easier monetary policy which should translate into lower
interest rates for home mortgages and other consumer loans.
   Normally, lower interest rates stimulate home buying, but
convention participants said only dramatically lower rates would
overcome public fears of the economic consequences of war in the
Mideast.
   ``Immediately after the Kuwaiti invasion we saw a sharp shift in
buying habits. It's a confidence problem,'' said Gerald J. Levy,
chairman of Guaranty Bank, Milwaukee.

   peter ride ederrr said the irolo ed loan would come up early
next month before the bank's Board of Executive Directors, who
represent the 154 member governments. China has been a member since
1980, when it wrested a seat from the nationalist government on
Taiwan.
   Conable will see Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other
Kremlin leaders. Managing Director Michel Camdessus of the
International Monetary Fund, the bank's sister organization, has
already been to Moscow.
   The two groups are working with two other international
organizations on a report about the Soviet Union's economy. They
are trying to help shift it away from the state controls of
communism toward more dependence on markets, as they also do in
China.
   The United States - as the largest stockholder - has 15.37 or
17.41 percent of the voting power in the World Bank, depending on
the type of loan. It does not have a veto on loans, but serious
opposition from it has usually prevented a loan from reaching the
board.
   It does have a veto on basic changes in the bank and fund, and
so far Washington has opposed Soviet membership.
   The bank is the Third World's biggest single source of aid,
lending more than $21 billion a year. As a non-member, the Soviet
Union gets none of its loans.
   After Chinese army tanks rolled into Beijing's Tiananmen Square
on June 4, 1989 to crush the pro-democracy movement, Conable
withdrew $870 million in pending loans for China for eight months.
He also suspended the bank's permanent mission in Beijing.
   It was Feb. 8 of this year before China got another loan - $40
million for earthquake relief.
   Just two weeks ago, the World Bank made a $275 million loan to
Chinese banks, designed to be lent to Chinese farmers. Barbara
Clay, a press officer for the U.S. Treasury, said Tuesday that the
administration considered the loan to be for basic human needs and
did not oppose it.

<HEAD>Murdoch's Company Examining Merger Proposal For Two Newspapers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Media baron Rupert Murdoch's News International
said Tuesday it is examining a merger proposal between one of its
British newspapers, called Today, and another London paper, the
Sunday Correspondent.
   The company said in a statement it had been approached last
weekend by the weekly Sunday Correspondent suggesting the merger
with the daily Today.
   The proposal was to have a round-the-week operation in which
News International would have a minority share, News International
said.
   The Sunday Correspondent was launched Sept. 17, 1989. There are
11 papers published in Britain on Sundays and they compete
ferociously for readers.
   In a bid to win greater popularity with a mass national
readership, the Sunday Correspondent abandoned its broadsheet
format on Sept. 30 to become a tabloid.
   This followed a fall in sales to below the 350,000 copies needed
to break even, a financial rescue package and the resignation of
editor Peter Cole in what it called ``the interests of the
continued shareholder support.''
   The Times of London, another Murdoch paper, said the paper's
current circulation is below 300,000.
   Sunday Correspondent shareholders include the Chicago Tribune;
the British daily newspaper The Guardian; Robert Maxwell, owner of
Mirror Group Newspapers whose British tabloid flagship is the Daily
Mirror; and Saudi Arabian investor Wafiq Saeed.
   Publisher Eddie Shah launched Today in March 1986 as Britain's
first electronically produced national daily paper. It accelerated
a technological revolution in Britain's national newspaper
industry, which until 1986 was dominated by outdated production
methods largely as a result of union militancy.
   But Today did not thrive under Shah and businessman Tiny
Rowland's international conglomerate Lonrho PLC bought it from him
later in 1986.
   Lonrho cut Today's heavy financial losses and increased its
advertising revenue and circulation but sold it to Murdoch in 1987
for 38 million pounds, which was then worth about $60.8 million.
   The paper now sells 588,000 copies a day.
   The Times reported a merger would result in significant cost
savings, involving job losses at both newspapers.
   News International said no deal had been reached and that it had
issued the statement ``simply to avoid unnecessary and inaccurate
rumors whilst this approach is being examined.''
   It said it was continuing efforts to make Today profitable.
   Murdoch, who was born in Australia but has become a U.S.
citizen, controls about a third of Britain's national daily and
Sunday newspaper circulation. In addition to The Times and Today,
he owns the The Sun and two Sunday newspapers.
   On Nov. 2, his four-channel Sky television service announced it
would merge with its rival British Satellite Broadcasting's five
channels to form a new five-channel network called British Sky
Broadcasting.

<HEAD>Top Bally Executive Steps Down as Company Announces Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bally Manufacturing Corp. has proposed a
comprehensive debt-restructuring plan, while at the same time
announcing the president and chief operating officer of the gaming
company has stepped down.
   Roger N. Keesee was replaced by Richard Gillman, who headed
Bally's casino operations in Nevada and Atlantic City, the company
said.
   Keesee and company management said his departure last week was
amicable. Arthur Goldberg, the company's largest shareholder who
took the reins as interim chief operating officer last month, said
the decision to switch presidents reflected the company's changing
focus and denied it was the result of a power play.
   Bally also said Monday that it is unclear whether it will make
an already delayed $18.4 million interest payment later this week
on $1.8 billion in debt from a restructuring of its Nevada casino
subsidiary.
   ``We're still talking and hope debt holders will see our plan as
the intelligent way for us to meet our obligations,'' Goldberg
said.
   Under the restructuring plan, which Bally said is preliminary,
the Chicago-based company said it:
   -Hired Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., and BT Securities Corp., to
implement restructuring and refinancing plans.
   -Hired Manufacturers Hanover trust to serve as agent to sell
Bally's Life Fitness Inc., a maker of fitness equipment, with sales
of $70 million last year.
   -Was discontinuing plans to sell its Health &amp; Tennis Corp.
subsidiary, which operates the nation's largest string of health
clubs, including Chicago Health Club facilities.
   -Had reached an agreement with the Rank Organisation with
withdraw itself from an earlier deal to acquire the Clermont Club
casino in London. In January, Bally said it would pay $50 million
for the casino.
   Goldberg said Bally and its advisers could have a complete
restructuring plan before its bondholders in 30 to 60 days.

<HEAD>Gap's Infant Offerings Are Another Winner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gap Inc. is a proud parent - again.
   After downscaling its trendy Gap apparel line into kid sizes,
the California retailer has further miniaturized its offerings for
the newborn-to-toddler set.
   The first babyGap appeared just nine months ago in a corner of a
Gap store in San Francisco. Since then the company has spawned
babyGap departments within 50 of its 150 GapKids stores that dot
the nation's shopping landscape.
   Though still in its infancy, industry analysts say babyGap has
become a ``roaring'' success story based on the same formula that
catapulted the company to the status of industry darling: durable
clothing in comfortable, generous cuts at affordable prices.
   Indeed, Gap went against the tide by selecting quality suppliers
that do not normally manufacture children's clothing to create a
``hybrid of better quality and fun fashion which is unique in kids'
merchandising,'' said Thomas Tashjian, an analyst with Seidler
Amdek Securities Inc. in Los Angeles.
   For parents who cringe at swathing their little ones in
synthetic fabrics, babyGap offerings are strictly 100 percent
sturdy cotton. Banished from shelves are those anemic
gender-identifying pastels - only deep, bold hues can be found on
everything from rugby-striped jumpsuits to raime v-neck pullovers
and crisp embroidered blouses in tiny sizes. Where else can you
find a single-pocket T-shirt in black for a 1-year-old, a Gap
spokesman asked rhetorically.
   The seasonal color palette and natural fibers are what attracted
Laura Cooper, a mother from Brooklyn, N.Y., to the babyGap shops in
Manhattan shortly after they opened.
   ``What they do well is edit each of the lines so that you're not
overwhelmed with what to choose from,'' Cooper said. And individual
items available in an array of colors make for ``an easy way to put
together a complementary wardrobe,'' she said.
   Because Gap turns over its merchandise very frequently, Cooper
heads straight for the ``sale'' sign. Though Gap spokesman Richard
Crisman said the company is ``not in the business of offering sale
racks,'' he conceded merchandise is set aside to make way for fresh
offerings, which arrive every six weeks or so.
   ``You will find a new color palette and new designs (every six
weeks) - it may be the same T-shirt, but it might be in a new
color, or we may have added a detail,'' he said.
   The babyGap was the logical outgrowth of GapKids, which was
created in 1985 out of Gap President Millard ``Mickey'' Drexler's
search for stylish but long-lasting clothing for his own young son.
Drexler, who rarely speaks to the press, voiced his frustrations to
staff members and realized how tired others also were of pink and
blue, Crisman said.
   Originally the kids' clothes were simply scaled-down versions of
the adult line, but once executives realized what a hit they had on
their hands, Gap established a team to design just the children's
line.
   Because the kids stores are smaller - partially to minimize the
risk in launching the line and also because the merchandise is,
well, smaller - sales per square foot outpace that of Gap stores,
already among the highest in the industry. Analysts have estimated
Gap sales at about $360 a square foot; babyGap at $400.
   Even in this dismal retail environment, the Gap is expected to
fare well during the crucial holiday season, mainly because it is a
lean operation with low fixed costs and price tags that will not
send recession-weary consumers into cardiac arrest. Big-sellers in
the baby department are the denim overalls for $28, embroidered
blouses for $16, and long-sleeve T-shirts in bright blue, purple,
yellow or red for $10.
   Donald Trott, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.,
estimates that Gap will report earnings of $1.82 a share for the
fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 1991, up from $1.38 the previous year.
Sales are expected to total $1.94 billion, up from $1.59 billion.
   ``Their growth rate has been running at around 20 percent (a
year), and it is expected to continue to run at that pace,'' he
said. ``GapKids is certainly helping that growth rate. ... In terms
of total contribution, babyGap is not significant yet, but we think
it has good potential.''
   Many GapKids stores are located either within or in sight of
regular Gap stores in an effort to piggyback customer traffic.
``There's a benefit to both,'' Crisman said.
   Having children's and adult clothing under the same roof allows
consumers to do all their shopping at one time. But separate
children's stores eliminates the problem of kids who ``don't want
to be shopping in the same store as their parents,'' Crisman said.
   The company's latest strategy is to open even bigger stores that
can expand the product line and incorporate adult, kids and baby
gear all under one roof.
   GapKids and babyGap are a significant part of Gap's future. The
company plans to open more than 40 new Gap stores in 1991; it will
open just as many GapKids with babyGap departments.
   ``We don't do anything here in a big way until we are entirely
sure of it, and this is going gangbusters,'' Crisman said.
   The company, which also owns the Banana Republic chain, is
expanding its Gap stores in Britain and Canada. The first
free-standing GapKids store opened in London earlier this year.
   ``The regular line already has 750 stores ... and there isn't
any reason why the kids line can't follow along the (parent's)
coattails'' in terms of success, analyst Tashjian said.
   Perhaps Gap's greatest achievement has been its ability to
capitalize on the handing down of tradition. Most middle-class
babyboomers grew up with some relationship with the Gap; now their
children can be clad in similar fare - all exclusive to the Gap.

   It was founded as an example of economic hope
and inspiration for black Harlem. But now, Freedom National Bank of
New York has closed its doors for good.
   Federal officials began paying off customers' insured deposits
Tuesday at the bank, which was established in 1964 and was one of
the largest minority-owned banks in the country.
   Freedom National lost nearly $4 million over the last two years
and was expected to lose at least an additional $2 million this
year, said the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   The federal agency declared the bank insolvent Friday, and
community leaders scrambled during the Veterans Day holiday weekend
to find $6 million need to stop the bank's closing.
   U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel of Harlem said enough money had been
committed to save the bank, but the cash could not be moved to the
right hands by a 7 a.m. Tuesday deadline set by FDIC regulators.
   Rangel said there was no question that a day's grace would have
saved the bank, whose first chairman was baseball immortal Jackie
Robinson.
   The bank had assets of $101.9 million, 22,000 depositors and 97
employees.
   ``Had this been a white bank in a white community, I'm sure they
wouldn't have done this so precipitously,'' the Rev. Wyatt Tee
Walker said outside the bank's main office in Harlem, where some
400 depositors waited on line to get their money. The bank also had
two branches in Brooklyn.
   ``It looks like Freedom never had a chance. Black people come
last in this country's agenda,'' said Walker, whose Canaan Baptist
Church had more than $500,000 deposited in the bank.
   Few of those who started forming a line at the bank before dawn
expressed fear about the safety of their money.
   When the doors opened, federal banking officials were sitting at
long tables covered with checks to close out all of Freedom
National's accounts of $100,000 or less, said FDIC spokesman Caryl
Austrian.

<HEAD>Soviet Economists Looking For Guidance From Western Colleagues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet economists have been looking to
their colleagues in the West for both guidance and reassurance as
they struggle towards a market economy, Soviet and American
economists meeting at Yale said.
   Economists from the Soviet Union can read about how the Federal
Reserve System works but ``it's not quite the same as talking to
someone who knows how it functions,'' said Merton J. Peck, a Yale
economics professor involved in an international effort to assist
the Soviets.
   Peck said Tuesday the Soviets are also looking for reassurance
as they make a ``tremendous leap of faith.''
   While sharp divisions exist in the Soviet Union over how to go
about restructuring their economy, ``the interesting thing to me is
there is current no discussion that we (the Soviets) don't go to
the market,'' Peck said.
   Several Soviet economists, including a member of the group that
drafted the so-called ``Shatalin 500-day Plan,'' are meeting at
Yale this week with economists from the United States, Japan and
Europe.
   The economists are part of a group established by the
International Institute For Applied Systems Analysis, an East-West
organization based near Vienna, Austria.
   The group was formed last year at the request of Stanislav
Shatalin, economic advisor to Mikhail Gorbachev and head of the
task force that wrote the 500-day plan. Previous sessions were held
in Austria and Hungary.
   ``We need to rethink the questions that have been raised in the
context of where the Soviet Union is going now,'' Peck said.
   Eugeny Yasin, an economist and member of the Shatalin group,
told a news conference Tuesday that he was initially skeptical that
the Soviets could gain much from meeting with foreign experts.
   But after taking part in the meetings with economists from the
West, ``I completely changed my mind,'' Yasin said through a
translator, a fellow Soviet economist.
   Peck said one of the problems in the past was that economists
from the West used to go over and lecture their Soviet
counterparts.
   ``We try to think of this exchange more as a dialogue and as
problem solving. That is the distinguishing feature of our group,''
he said.
   While the international conference is under way at Yale, another
Soviet exchange is taking place at Southern Connecticut State
University in New Haven.
   Five faculty members and nine students from the Moscow Financial
Institute, as well as the institute's director, will be learning
about entrepreneurship, marketing and productivity at SCSU's School
of Business.

<HEAD>Profit Jumps 9.4 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways PLC said Wednesday its
second-quarter profit rose 9.4 percent but its chairman warned that
a profit in the second half was unlikely.
   For the three months ended Sept. 30, after-tax profits for
Britain's biggest airline came to 116 million pounds, or $217
million, compared with 106 million pounds in the same period a year
ago.
   Sales rose 4.6 percent to 1.4 billion pounds, or $2.6 billion,
from 1.35 billion pounds a year earlier.
   For the first six months of the year, after-tax profit jumped 35
percent to 227 million pounds, or $424 million, from 168 million
pounds a year earlier.
   Half-year sales gained 8.7 percent to 2.75 billion pounds, or
$5.1 billion, from 2.53 billion pounds a year earlier.
   The airline's chairman, Lord King, said the company was
``unlikely to show a profit'' in the second half of the year
because of higher fuel costs that have resulted from the Middle
East crisis.
   He said fare increases won't recoup the extra costs associated
with fuel costs and expected lower traffic growth.
   The group is carrying out a series of cost cutting exercises to
``minimize the impact'' of the problems the airline faces in the
short term, he said.
   British Airways said that the increase in fuel costs over the
half-year was limited to 7.4 percent because arrangements to buy
fuel were made in advance of the actual purchases and because of
exchange rate benefits. Fuel costs generally increased 23 percent
in the second quarter from a year earlier.
   British Airways said 10.7 percent, or 13.6 million, more
passengers were carried on scheduled services in the half year.
   The figures were converted into dollars at exchange rates
provided by the company of $1.87 to the pound.

<TEXT>
   South Korea exported 249,000 motor
vehicles between January and October, down 9.5 percent from a year
ago, the Korea Automobile Manufacturing Association reported
Wednesday.
   The decline in exports was attributed to price competition and
sluggish demand in the United States which is Korea's biggest
export market.
   The association said the number of Korean-made vehicles sold on
the domestic market in the first 10 months of this year jumped 24.8
percent to 768,000 from a year ago.
   Association officials said total sales rose to 748,000 cars, up
9.4 percent from a year ago, and 269,000 comemrcial vehicles, up
29.7 perrcent.
   The officials said Hyundai Motor Co. topped the list of Korean
automakers by marketing 530,000 vehicles at home and abroad during
the 10 months, up 7 percent from a year ago. It was followed by Kia
Motors Corp. with 313,000 motor vehicles, up 24.7 percent, and
Daewoo Motor Co. with 135,000 vehicles, up 15.4 percent.

<HEAD>Trump Casino and Bondholders Break Off Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Investors in the Taj Mahal Casino
Resort and casino owner Donald Trump blame each other for breaking
off debt restructuring talks just before a $47.3 million payment
comes due Thursday.
   No new negotiations were scheduled after talks broke off Tuesday
between Trump and holders of $675 million in bonds used to finance
the Taj Mahal, the most ostentatious casino in Atlantic City.
   Wilbur Ross, senior managing director for New York-based
Rothschild Inc. which is negotiating for bondholders, said they're
willing to renew negotiations if Trump is reasonable.
   ``It's up to them,'' Ross said in a telephone interview from New
York. ``We're perfectly willing to return.''
   But Ross said bondholders remain willing to take their chances
at throwing Trump into bankruptcy rather than accept the offer
Trump made to restructure the money he owes. The bondholders are
secured, or first in line in any list of creditor demands, he said.
   Trump has a 30-day grace period to make the payment after
Thursday with failure opening up the prospect that the Taj Mahal
could be thrown into bankruptcy months after it opened April 2 as
Atlantic City's newest and biggest casino.
   Trump said in a news release Tuesday that the bondholders
represented by Rothschild Inc. presented unrealistic demands.
   ``We saw no point in going forward,'' Trump said.
``Unfortunately this case will be in court for many years to
come.''
   Trump said numerous bondholders have contacted his New
York-based Trump Organization seeking to deal apart from Rothschild
Inc. Trump did not elaborate.
   Calls to the Trump Organization seeking comment were referred to
chief financial officer Stephen Bollenbach. Telephone messages left
for Bollenbach were not immediately returned. But he was quoted in
New York-area newspapers today as saying he believed a compromise
deal could still be struck.
   Ross said bondholders remain united.
   ``An age-old strategy is to try to divide and conquer your
enemy,'' Ross said.
   He said Trump failed to budge on four bondholder demands - the
amount of interest that Trump would pay, whether excess cash in the
casino would be earmarked as supplemental interest for bondholders,
the amount of equity that Trump would sacrifice in exchange for
restructured terms and bondholders' influence over a board of
directors.
   Ross would not be more specific about the negotiating terms, but
Trump said in a filing last month with the Securities and Exchange
Commission he would offer the bondholders 19.9 percent in the
casino.
   The state Casino Control Commission is scheduled to hold a
hearing Dec. 3
   on the financial stability of Trump's three casinos, which
include the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino and Trump Castle Casino
Resort By The Bay.
   The commission scheduled the financial stability hearing after
approving in August a $65 million emergency bank loan to Trump
Castle designed to stave off a default at that property.
   All three casinos have suffered this year along with the entire
gaming industry in Atlantic City. Gross gaming revenues at Trump
Plaza and Trump Castle plunged after the Taj Mahal opened.
   The Taj Mahal has posted the city's highest gross gaming
revenues since gambling came in 1978. But the mammoth casino, which
cost $1 billion to build, has failed to make the $1.3 million a day
that analysts said it would need to break even on its debt-financed
property.
   Rothschild represents a steering committee of about 35 percent
of the bondholder interests. The steering committee was elected by
about 85 percent of the bondholder interests, Ross said.

<TEXT>
   More foreign companies have withdrawn
from South Korea in the first nine months of this year than in
either of the past two years, a government report said Wednesday.
   The report attributed the development to the nation's economic
slowdown and unfavorable labor and management conditions.
   A Finance Ministry report said 30 foreign firms withdrew in the
first nine months this year. The report said 28 foreign investors
left South Korea in 1989 and 19 left in 1988.
   Many of the foreign companies leaving South Korea have sought
business in the European Community and East European countries, the
report said. It said wage hikes, labor unrest and a structural
shift in South Korea's economy following an economic slowdown were
responsible.

   CS First Boston Inc. will lay off about 200
workers by the end of the year and surrender majority ownership to
the parent of Credit Swisse in a major rescue effort for the
struggling investment bank.
   First Boston will sell $300 million in equity to CS Holding,
raising the Swiss company's stake to 60 percent from 44.5 percent.
Also, CS will give CS First Boston $425 million in cash for the
bulk of its troubled loan portfolio. The weak loans have weighed
heavily on its balance sheet and led to a potentially damaging
credit rating review.
   The rescue is the latest fallout from Wall Street's lingering
recession that has eliminated tens of thousands of jobs, dried up
profitable business sectors and forced major firms to seek help
from corporate parents.
   The deal also marks the first time a foreign company has taken
majority control of a major U.S. investment bank. CS First Boston
is the parent of First Boston Corp., which had about 3,850
employees at the end of October.
   ``We want to be certain that the depth of our commitment to CS
First Boston is clear and that the strength of our investment
banking affiliate is beyond question,'' CS Holding Chairman Rainer
S. Gut said in a statement.
   The bailout by CS Holding is the second this year by the parent
of an ailing Wall Street subsidiary. American Express Co. early
this year injected $1.3 billion into Shearson Lehman Holdings Inc.
and took the company private.
   The First Boston restructuring rids the firm of the majority of
$1.1 billion in temporary ``bridge loans'' made to corporate
clients that the firm has been unable to sell because of the
collapse of the junk bond market.
   Under the plan, CS First Boston will place all its bridge loans
except for those to Campeau Corp.'s Federated Department Stores
subsidiary and to Jerrico Inc. into a special limited partnership.
   In exchange, CS First Boston will receive a stake in the
partnership, which also will contain some equity investments, and
the $425 million in cash. The firm still will hold $377 million in
the troublesome bridge loans, however.
   Additionally, CS First Boston announced it was writing off $360
million in soured investments, including the Federated and Jerrico
bridge loans and some real estate, venture capital and leveraged
buyout investments.
   That action is expected to reduce the firm's 1990 earnings.
First Boston made just $11 million last year and reportedly has
losses so far this year.
   Wall Street analysts said the moves were favorable and could
head off a potential downgrade in First Boston's credit rating,
which would make the firm's daily borrowing requirements more
costly.
   ``The closer relationship with CS Holding and the strenghtening
of the financial structure are positive steps,'' said John J. Kriz,
a vice president with Moody's Investors Service Inc., a major
credit rating agency.
   Moody's several weeks ago placed First Boston's credit rating
under review. Kriz said Moody's would evaluate the rating in light
of the recapitalization plan.
   The 200 layoffs are in addition to about 100 firings in recent
weeks in the firm's stock and operations departments. By the end of
the year, First Boston will have reduced its total U.S. employment
by nearly 8 percent. The company employs 5,800 people worldwide.
   The firm was taken private in 1988 in a merger between First
Boston and its European affiliate. But it fell on hard times last
year, particularly because of the collapse in the market for junk
bonds, the high-yield securities in which the company was a major
player.

<HEAD>Germany Announces Plans for Defense Spending Cuts</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to CLARIFY that what was announced were budget
outlines, not final budget; move tax proposal higher; edits

<BYLINE>By MAUD S. BEELMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The German government on Wednesday
announced plans to cut defense spending by 2.5 billion marks, or
$1.7 billion, next year and impose no new taxes in the first budget
of united Germany.
   Partial budget proposals, approved by the conservative Cabinet
on Wednesday and outlined by Finance Minister Theo Waigel, also
called for setting a federal deficit cap of 70 billion marks, or
$47 billion, for 1991 and reducing the federal deficit to 30
billion marks, or $20 billion, by 1994.
   The 1990 federal deficit was 66.8 billion marks, or $45 billion.
   A detailed budget is expected to be presented to the new unified
German government next spring.
   The partial proposal did not give an overall spending figure for
the united country, but Waigel said he expected spending to be no
more than 2 percent higher than the combined 1990 budgets of East
and West Germany.
   Officials said the two countries had total budgets of 396
billion marks, or about $265 billion, before they unified on Oct.
3.
   Waigel said he did not expect there would be tax increases.
   ``If decisive measures are taken, tax increases will not be
necessary,'' Waigel said. ``It would be counterproductive to take
measures that weaken the German economy.''
   The two German governments spent about 57 billion marks, or $38
billion, on defense in 1990, an official in the finance ministry
said. The 1991 cuts of 2.5 billion marks would represent a 4
percent reduction in defense spending.
   Earlier in the week, Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg
outlined plans to cut Germany's armed forces to 370,000 from about
525,000 over the next four years. Germany agreed to the troop
reduction in exchange for the Soviet Union's blessing of united
Germany's continued NATO membership and the gradual withdrawal of
Soviet troops from former East German territory.
   Waigel told reporters the government expected the economy to
grow 3 percent to 3.5 percent in what used to be West Germany in
1991. He said projected growth for a united Germany in 1991 would
be 2 percent to 3 percent.
   Inflation was expected to run about 3 percent next year, but
could decline to 2.5 percent, Waigel added.
   Western states must show solidarity and bear more of the cost of
German unity, the minister added. Living and industrial standards
in the five new eastern German states created after Oct. 3
unification were devastated by 40 years of communist central
planning and neglect.
   The 1991 budget plans call for the federal government to spend
74 billion marks, or $50 billion, and the western states an
additional 3 billion marks, or $2 billion, on unification costs.
   Waigel said the federal and western state governments had spent
46 billion marks, or $31 billion, on unification in 1990.
   Waigel said it was impossible to predict how the budget might be
affected if war breaks out in the Persian Gulf.
   Germany's constitution prohibits it from sending soldiers to
non-NATO countries. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Stoltenberg both
favor changing the constitution to allow German troops to take part
in U.N. actions. Kohl says the new Parliament, to be elected Dec.
2, will consider the matter.

   The stock market edged upward today as traders
kept a wary eye on interest rates and oil prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.18 points to
2,541.58 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 625 up, 548 down and
571 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 45.86 million shares at
midmorning.
   Interest rates have been falling steadily of late in the credit
markets amid spreading expectations of a new move by the Federal
Reserve to relax its credit policy.
   Today, however, prices of Treasury bonds and bills were little
changed in early activity.
   Oil prices declined slightly on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. But analysts said uncertainty persisted about the
longer-term direction of the oil market.
   In the absence of any pronounced stimulus from those sources,
analysts said stocks were simply drifting.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business

<HEAD>EC Commission Proposes Cancelling Developing Nations' Debt to EC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community Commission on
Wednesday proposed to cancel $4.3 billion in debt that 69
developing nations owe the European Community as a whole.
   The debt, worth 3.1 billion European currency units, is owed by
African, Caribbean and Pacific nations that have special trade ties
with the EC.
   EC Development Commissioner Manual Marin said his debt
cancellation proposal ``does not cover bilateral debt,'' between
the ACP and the 12 EC states but between the ACP nations and the
Community as a whole.
   The ACP nations are mostly former European colonies.
   Their debt to the EC stems from special loans and risk capital
the EC has granted through trade and aid treaties over the past 15
years.
   Marin said his proposal for debt cancellation would be ``a new
political signal'' of the Community's willingness to help some of
the world's poorest nations.
   While some have a poor record in repaying debts to individual
donor nations, Marin said the ACP nations have always paid back
their debts to the Community.
   His called his proposal for a blanket cancellation of debt ``an
overall gesture'' of goodwill to developing nations regardless of
their human rights records or efforts to overhaul their economies.
   Linking debt cancellation to respect for human rights, he said,
``was a delicate matter'' that was not for the EC Commision to
decide, he added.

   Soybean futures prices slid today for the fourth
consecutive session, hitting new near-term contract lows today on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Grain prices also plunged.
   Traders say followthrough selling from yesterday's poor close
will pressure futures throughout the day.
   Corn, soybean and wheat prices are all suffering from
near-record harvests and little export demand, and prices have
slumped as speculators move to the sidelines waiting for activity.
   Soybeans also have been hurt by a government report issued last
week that found a higher than expected supply of the crop than was
previously expected.
   Soybeans could gather some support today, however, from Taiwan's
reported purchase of 20 thousand tons of the crop and rumors that
Israel and Mexico also may be in the market.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 5{ cents to 3{ cents lower

<DATELINE>HOLLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gerrard W. Haworth was a high school shop
instructor with a hobby shop on the side when he was turned down
for a bank loan to start a wood products business.
   That was in 1948. It was probably one of the few setbacks
Haworth encountered in his business venture. And even that one was
temporary; his parents wound up lending him the $10,000 needed to
get started.
   Today, Haworth Inc. is a global office furniture company with
worldwide sales that approached $550 million in 1989, 4,200
employees and 370 dealers.
   ``Sometimes I have to pinch myself to realize how far we've
come,'' said the spry 79-year-old Haworth, who remains the
company's chairman. ``It all started as a little hobby shop on the
side; I bought a few tools and started building this and that in my
spare time.''
   Among his spare-time projects was a request from a Philadelphia
client to build wood dividers for an office - a new concept at the
time, and one that has revolutionized the layout of offices around
the country.
   Office partitions were the focus of Haworth's business until
1975, when he sold the $10 million business, Modern Products Inc.,
and son Richard helped transform the family company into a
full-line office furniture supplier.
   From 1978-88, the company grew at more than twice the industry's
rate, with sales increasing annually, anywhere from 20 percent to
60 percent.
   ``A few years before my father died, I took him to this
600,000-square-foot building we had built here and he took it all
in and said, `Gerry, why do you want to get so big?''' the elder
Haworth recalled. ``I said, `Dad, I don't know how to control
it.'''
   Indeed, growth at Haworth has been practically uncontrollable
since 1976, when the company introduced a pre-wired office panel.
It further revolutionized office design by eliminating the need for
new electrical wiring or extension cords every time an office was
created or altered.
   ``The electrified panel put them on the map. People went nuts
for it,'' said Alan Zimmerman, president of Radley Resources, a
Westfield, N.J., marketing and consulting firm. ``To start from
nothing and suddenly have a half-billion-dollar company is
incredible.''
   Despite its success, Haworth kept a relatively low profile in
the industry until five years ago, when it accused industry leader
Steelcase Inc. of Grand Rapids of stealing the technology for the
patented panel.
   After a prolonged court fight, Haworth won. The two sides now
are negotiating what Haworth is owed, and analysts say the figure
may be in the tens of millions.
   The company is facing off with another competitor that's
threatening its No. 3 spot in the industry.
   Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s Kentwood-based furniture division
went on a buying spree this year, snapping up several companies,
including Knoll International of New York. The acquisitions are
expected to boost Westinghouse's furniture sales to about $600
million, which is what Haworth is predicting for 1990.
   ``I don't really consider ourselves out of the No. 3 slot,
though we don't have the clarity of being there that we had
before,'' said Richard Haworth, president and chief executive
officer. ``But I don't really think that's the point. The point is
that we can still provide better quality and service.''
   Still, Haworth isn't sitting back. The company has made several
recent purchases of smaller companies and product lines and says it
still is looking toward more expansion, especially in Europe.
   And like the company that bears his name, the elder Haworth says
he has no plans to slow down.
   ``When people ask, `Gerry, why don't you hang it up?' I laugh. I
started this business as a hobby, why shouldn't I continue it has a
hobby?'' said Haworth, who traded his teaching job at the local
high school for a chance to start a business and better support his
wife and four children.
   He remains keenly interested in the education field. He recently
donated $5 million for a new business college at his alma mater,
Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo. The building, which will
open in January, will be called the Haworth College of Business.
   A mild-mannered man with an easy smile that shaves at least 10
years off his age, Haworth has a paternalistic quality and commands
respect as he addresses new employees - called ``members'' - at the
start of a two-week orientation at the company's headquarters.
   One of the first to arrive for the 7:30 a.m. session, Haworth
makes sure the groggy-eyed trainees are well-acquainted with the
``Haworth Creed:'' The customer comes first.
   ``You are the ones on the front line. The first impressions you
make with the customers are the lasting ones,'' said Haworth, a
bespectacled man with a receding white hairline.
   He speaks for just a few minutes before giving the floor to his
son, who closely resembles his father in appearance and
personality, but with a slightly harder edge.
   ``I think it's great having dad talk to them (the employees),''
the younger Haworth said. ``It adds a feeling of stability ... and
I think they sense he really does care.''

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.13 points to
2,546.53 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 771 up, 532 down and
525 unchanged.
   Interest rates have been falling steadily of late in the credit
markets amid spreading expectations of a new move by the Federal
Reserve to relax its credit policy.
   Today, however, prices of Treasury bonds and bills were little
changed in early activity.
   Oil prices declined slightly on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. But analysts said uncertainty persisted about the
longer-term direction of the oil market.
   In the absence of any pronounced stimulus from those sources,
analysts said stocks were simply drifting.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose 1{ to 113{; General Motors } to 39}; Philip Morris &lsqb;
to 25&rsqb;, and Pepsico &lsqb; to 25&rsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.65 to 173.96. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.15 at 296.71.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 75.83 million shares at
noontime, down from 80.87 million at the same point Tuesday.

   Sentencing of former junk bond financier Michael
Milken will take place next week, a clerk for U.S. District Judge
Kimba Wood said Wednesday.
   The sentencing was expected to take place this week. No reason
for the delay was given. A specific date and time for the
sentencing was not announced.
   Milken, 44, the former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s
high-yield bond department, faces up to 28 years in prison for his
guilty plea to six felony counts of conspiracy and fraud related to
illegal securities trading.
   Prosecutors are seeking a stiff prison sentence. Milken and his
attorneys have asked the judge for a term of community service.
   Sentencing initially was scheduled for Oct. 1 but was delayed
for a hearing into additional government allegations against
Milken. Milken did not testify at the hearing but submitted a
lengthy letter to the judge accepting responsibility for his crimes
but requesting lenience.

<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. and Thorn EMI PLC are
forming a new lighting company in the United Kingdom, the companies
announced Wednesday.
   GE will hold a 51 percent interest and take management control
of the new company, GE-Thorn Lamps Ltd. The two organizations will
collaborate on lamp marketing and distribution, and after three
years Thorn EMI's minority interest will transfer to GE.
   Under the agreement, which is subject to regulatory approval, GE
will also buy Thorn Lighting's principal light source interests
outside the United Kingdom.
   GE will acquire Thorn's British manufacturing plants at Enfield,
Leicester, Mitcham and New Malden to form the new company. GE will
also acquire Thorn's 100 percent interest in Gluhlampenfabrik Jahn
in Germany and Thorn's 51 percent investment in Sivi Illuminazione
in Italy.
   Thorn will retain facilities at Merthyr, Preston and Rodney,
Great Britain.
   Colin Southgate, Thorn's chairman and chief executive, said the
alliance is a good match.
   ``GE is a world leader in light sources, while our strengths are
in fittings,'' Southgate said. ``This alliance will allow Thorn
Lighting to concentrate its resources and energies on designing,
manufacturing and marketing innovative fittings for world
markets.''
   Said John D. Opie, GE senior vice president: ``We view this as a
teaming of two businesses that are highly regarded in their
fields.''
   GE, which operates 13 businesses including lighting, had
revenues of $55 billion and net earnings of nearly $4 billion last
year.
   Thorn, based in the United Kingdom with operations in 43
countries, had revenues of more than $7.4 billion in its 1989-90
fiscal year.

<TEXT>
   Robert Kearns, who owns the patent for
intermittent windshield wipers, today settled a 12-year-old lawsuit
against Ford Motor Co. for $10.2 million.
   U.S. District Judge Avern Cohn approved the settlement after
spending most of a 20-minute court hearing making sure Kearns
understood terms of the deal.
   Kearns' lawsuits against 19 other automakers remain active. He
contends that each failed to pay him royalties for using his
invention - a windhield wiper that starts and stops at intervals.
   Bill Durkee, Kearns' attorney, said the next target probably
will be Chrysler Corp. The nation's No. 3 automaker behind General
Motors Corp. and Ford has agreed not to argue about whether Kearns'
patents are valid, a contention that had been argued during the
suit against Ford.
   Durkee said he would have liked to continue the case against
Ford, but, ``As a practical matter, with all the other cases
pending, there was a logjam.
   ``When you step back and look at all this, sometimes it's better
to get on with other things,'' he said.
   Said Kearns: ``I don't think the goal was the magnitude of the
money. What I saw my role was to defend the patent system,'' said
Kearns. ``If I don't go further, there really isn't a patent
system.''
   Kearns, 63, and a former resident of Gaithersburg, Md., now
lives in a one-bedroom rented apartment in Houston, Texas. He is a
former engineering professor at Wayne State University in Detroit.
He said he planned to use the money to pay legal bills and,
perhaps, buy a house in Texas.
   He also said proceeds from the Ford case would be used in
lawsuits against the other defendants, including GM, Chrysler and
Japanese and European automakers.
   Durkee said preliminary work still needed to be done in many of
the cases, all pending before Cohn.
   Ford attorney Malcolm Wheeler said the company had resolved all
disputes with Kearns.
   ``We're pleased to be done with the litigation,'' he said. ``We
still believe that if we had another shot at it, the patents would
have been held invalid. We think this is an extremely reasonable
settlement.''
   Originally, Kearns sought $141 million and had rejected a $30
million settlement offer from Ford.
   Last July, after one mistrial, a federal jury ordered Ford to
pay $5.2 million plus interest, which pushed the award to between
$8.5 million and $11.5 million.
   By the end of this week, Durkee said a $10.2 million check in
Kearns' name will be put in an escrow account to which Kearns would
have immediate access.

<HEAD>Acura's `Little Ferrari': An Eye- and Money-Catcher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While some car buyers are drawn to big rebates,
others can't resist paying $40,000 over list price for a new set of
wheels.
   The Acura NSX is commanding that kind of money from those who
want an exotic car without a Ferrari or Lamborghini price tag.
   ``It's a bargain,'' said sales manager Betsy Volaric of Sunshine
Acura in Farmington Hills.
   The NSX, which looks a bit like a shrunken Ferrari Testarosa,
carries a list price of $60,000 with a manual transmission and
$63,000 for one with an automatic.
   But since Acura, the luxury division of Honda Motor Co. Ltd. of
Japan, plans to import just 3,000 of them a year, demand is far
outpacing supply.
   That pumps up the price.
   Premiums on cars are nothing new to the auto industry. Last
year, buyers shelled out up to $25,000 for the hard-to-get Mazda
Miata, which carried a base price of $13,800.
   Volaric said her dealership, one of 300 Acura dealers in the
country, is tacking $20,000 to $25,000 onto the price of the NSX,
because that's what the market will bear.
   ``Anybody who is familiar with the exotic car market realizes
that $85,000 is a bargain,'' she said. Ferraris and Lamborghinis
begin at more than $100,000 and stretch past $300,000 each, before
any premium.
   Acura spokesman Mike Spencer said dealers in markets with high
exotic-car interest, such as Los Angeles and Miami, are getting up
to $100,000 for an NSX - $40,000 over sticker price.
   ``Legally, we can't tell the dealers what to sell the cars
for,'' he said. ``At the same time, they look at this as `Geez, if
Isell the car to a speculator for $60,000 and he turns around and
sells it for $80,000 to $90,000, who's the fool here?'''
   A fool has no place behind the wheel of an NSX. The sleek,
two-seater packs a 3-liter, V-6 engine which puts out 270
horsepower. It's top speed is rated around 165 mph, and it can go
from a standing start to 60 mph in about 5.5 seconds.
   Tooling around Detroit freeways in an NSX causes normally vacant
highway stares to come alive. Even at highway speeds, motorists
hover around the NSX for a closer look.
   In a recent test drive:
   -The driver of a Mazda RX-7 on the right looked for a minute,
dropped back for a different view, came up on the left for another
peek and moved to the front to take a look at the NSX in his
rearview mirror.
   Afterwards, he dropped back to the right, nodded his head up and
down vigorously and flashed a thumbs-up sign.
   -A load of what appeared to be teen-agers in an Oldsmobile
pulled alongside and accelerated, appearing to dare a highway race.
The NSX is a conspicuous car and the offer was ignored.
   Parked at a local mall, the car was a magnet for nearly everyone
who walked by, including car crazies and store clerks.
   ``I thought it was a Ferrari,'' said Denise DiDonato, of
Rochester Hills, a cosmetics clerk at Saks Fifth Avenue in a
suburban Detroit shopping mall. ``It's cute, very cute.''
   She owns a 1990 Lincoln Town Car - 56.8 inches longer and 1,000
pounds heavier than an NSX.
   Kevin Corcoran, of Franklin, could have been doing an
advertisement for the car: ``It's extraordinarily flashy and
reasonably priced as far as these things go. There's a lot of
Italian in it.''
   Corcoran owns a pickup, in which he spends most of his highway
time, and a McLaren, an extremely low-volume exotic sports car.
   With a target volume of 3,000 annually, the NSX doesn't pose a
significant volume threat to any car now being sold in the United
States.
   It's priced somewhere around a Porsche 911, the Mercedes-Benz
300-series, a BMW 7-series or a Chevrolet Corvette ZR-1, the
hottest car made by a major American manufacturer.
   The NSX doesn't look nearly as muscular as the ZR-1, and it
isn't. The ZR-1's 5.7-liter, V-8 engine produces 375 horsepower,
nearly 30 percent more than the NSX.
   The all-aluminum NSX makes up for some of that difference in
weight, coming in at 3,010 pounds compared with the ZR-1 at 3,465
pounds.
   Canadian visitor Craig Donnelly is an NSX fan. He said he had a
poster of a black one back home in Ottawa, where he also has a
Pontiac Sunbird.
   ``It's got the same size engine as that,'' he said nodding to
the NSX, ``but it doesn't go like that.''

<HEAD>U.S., Europe Still At Loggerheads over Farm Subsidies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
said Wednesday the United States would not budge on its demand for
sharp cuts in agricultural subsidies in the current round of world
trade talks.
   At a joint news conference with Yeutter, U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills said agriculture was the key to
resolving the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
   Mrs. Hills said quick progress was possible only if the European
Community showed the political will to achieve it. But she doubted
whether negotiators could have a deal ready for signing by the end
of the weeklong meeting, which begins in Brussels on Dec. 3.
   However, an American official in Brussels told reporters that
the United States has no intention of walking out of the talks,
despite the acrimonious dispute with the European Community.
   ``We want to keep at this. It is important. Even if the
prospects are unpromising ... you soldier on,'' said the official,
who demanded anonymity.
   ``I don't think the United States would be the first to walk
away from the table and I think we would discourage others from
walking away,'' he said.
   The United States has asked its trading partners to slash farm
income supports by 75 percent and export subsidies by 90 percent
over a 10-year period, starting in 1991.
   The United States hopes that lowering trade barriers will enable
its farmers to sell more goods on the world market. Other
farm-exporting countries, like Argentina and Australia, also would
like a chance to export more.
   The European Community, however, contends it needs its vast
network of agriculture supports to protect its farm community of
some 10 million farmers, many of whom have small operations.
   The EC has suggested trimming subsidies on major farm crops by
30 percent over 10 years, retroactive to 1986. It has made no
promises to reduce export subsidies.
   Yeutter said the Europeans have already cut about half of the
offered 30 percent, reducing their actual offer to a 15 percent
cut.
   Yeutter, who is visiting European capitals in search of a
compromise, said he has encountered a view among Europeans that the
United States will back down on its demands.
   ``That is a dangerous impression and one that is doomed to be
incorrect,'' Yeutter said.
   German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said after a meeting
with Yeutter that Germany hoped the talks could proceed on
technical questions despite the agriculture impasse. But Yeutter
said the heart of the issue must be addressed.
   Hills said many of the 105 nations involved in the Uruguay Round
will not be interested in making progress in other areas of the
talks, such as intellectual property or services, if they do not
achieve progress in the agricultural talks.
   Hills, U.S. Secretary of States James A. Baker III and Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher will travel to Brussels for another set
of talks on Friday. Top EC officials were in Washington earlier in
the week to address the dispute.

<HEAD>Nike Names Ad Agency to Develop Minority Campaign</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS name of group to `Operation PUSH' in 5th graf.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nike Inc., targeted for a boycott by a civil
rights group, named the Muse Cordero Chen agency to develop a
minority-oriented advertising campaign.
   The Beaverton, Ore., shoemaker said Tuesday that Muse Cordero
Chen will be assigned to Nike's ``Just Do It'' corporate campaign
and its ``Stay In School'' public affairs program.
   Muse Cordero Chen will work with Nike's ad agency, Wieden &amp;
Kennedy of Portland, Ore.
   Muse Cordero is based in Los Angeles and specializes in creating
marketing campaigns aimed at blacks, Hispanics and Asians. Its
clients have included Honda, the U.S. Census Bureau, Southern
California Gas Co. and Home Savings of America.
   Ken Smikle, president of the African American Marketing &amp; Media
Association, a Chicago trade group, said Nike's move appeared to be
motivated by a boycott led by Operation PUSH, the civil rights
group founded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   ``After months of denial, Nike has admitted that it can use the
expertise of minority marketers,'' Smikle said. ``The major concern
that we have is that they be given a significant account - one that
involves product advertising.''
   But Nike spokeswoman Liz Dolan said the search for an agency to
handle a minority campaign started two years ago and was not
inspired by the boycott.
   Dolan said the boycott ``made us aware that a multi-ethnic
agency is what we were looking for. Our thinking changed from just
looking for a Hispanic agency to one that could do Hispanic,
African American and Asian'' ads.
   Agency President J. Melvin Muse said his firm has not place a
dollar value on the Nike account. The agency handles about $16
million in ad spending a year.

<HEAD>Grains and Soybeans Prices Tumble</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grains and soybeans futures prices fell for the
fourth consecutive session Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade
as speculators fretted over abundant supplies and poor demand.
   Follow-through selling from Tuesday's poor close pressured
futures throughout the day as commercial firms cashed in, in light
of good harvesting weather in regions where the crops are grown.
   Corn, soybeans and wheat are all suffering from near-record
harvests and little export demand, and prices have slumped as
speculators move to the sidelines waiting for activity.
   ``We haven't seen any things confirmed in terms of export
activity,'' said Mark Weidner, an analyst for Cargill Investor
Services Inc. ``Without confirmation or seeing shipments going out,
rumors of activity will be just that and we'll continue to see
falling prices.''
   Soybeans also have suffered from a government report issued last
week that found a higher than expected supply of the crop than was
previously expected.
   Reports of Taiwan's purchase of 20,000 tons of the crop and talk
that Israel and Mexico also may be in the market failed to slow the
future's slide.
   At the close, wheat futures were 7} cents to 6 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.55\ a bushel; corn
futures were 6\ cents to 4{ cents lower with December at $2.24 a
bushel; oats were 5\ cents to 2\ cents lower with December at $1.08
a bushel; soybeans were 10 cents to 5} cents lower with November at
$5.54\ a bushel.

<HEAD>MCA Stock Jumps In Wake of Report of Intensified Talks with
Matsushita</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be updated with closing stock price.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCA Inc. stock climbed Wednesday after a
published report suggested talks are intensifying over the
possibility that Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. will
make a definitive bid to acquire the entertainment company.
   MCA and Matsushita confirmed in September they were in talks
about a buyout and there was speculation the Japanese electronics
manufacturer would offer about $85 a share for MCA, owner of
Universal Pictures and Universal Television.
   In trading late Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, MCA
was up $4.25 a share at $62.50.
   The Wall Street Journal reported that officials of MCA and
Matsushita have scheduled talks for Monday and hope to agree within
days on terms of a buyout.
   A spokeswoman for MCA in Universal City, Calif., said the
company had no comment on the report; a spokesman for Matsushita
failed to return a phone call.
   With about 92 million shares outstanding, a bid of $85 a share
would value MCA at about $7.8 billion.
   The Journal story said that a specific price is still up for
negotiation, and it cautioned that there is no certainty that a
deal will be negotiated or that the timetable will be followed.
   If a deal were worked out, it would be the latest example of
foreign ownership of a major American movie studio.
   In the biggest such deal to date, Japan's Sony Corp. bought
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. last year for $3.4 billion
plus debt that raised the total value of the deal to about $5
billion.

<HEAD>Toy Retailers In Guessing Game On Holiday Spending</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Christmas was on its way, lovely, glorious,
beautiful Christmas, around which the entire kid year revolved.''
   That was how humorist Jean Shepherd summed up the holiday season
in the 1983 film ``A Christmas Story,'' the tale of a little boy's
quest for the Christmas present of his dreams, an air rifle.
   And so it is for millions of children - Christmas is the high
point of their year. But this Christmas is a difficult one for many
of their parents, who are concerned about the economy and the
Middle East and have less money to spend on toys.
   Consumers are in a quandry, caught between financial restraints
and wanting to fulfill their children's Christmas wishes.
   Toy retailers and manufacturers already have felt the pinch.
Toys R Us Inc., the nation's biggest toy retailer, suffered a slump
in sales after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August that mirrored
the drop-off in business throughout the retail industry.
   Robert Nakasone, a Toys R Us vice chairman, acknowledged that
these are uncertain times, but he expected a merry Christmas
nonetheless.
   ``People may cut back for durables ... but when it comes down to
your kid at Christmas, it's pretty hard to say no to them,'' he
said.
   Even in relatively poor economic years, he said, Toys R Us has
had some of its best holiday seasons. In 1982, in the midst of the
country's last recession, toy sales for the entire industry rose 13
percent.
   But some industry analysts were not as sanguine. Daniel Barry,
of Kidder Peabody &amp; Co., said toy sales could slip along with other
merchandise sales this season.
   Retailers and manufacturers are concerned because even one less
toy under a Christmas tree, when multiplied by the more than 60
million children age 16 and under in the country, can make for a
poor Christmas season.
   Perhaps the most sensitive area is video games, which again are
on many wish lists this Christmas.
   Retailers and video game manufacturers face several unknowns.
Given the uncertain business environment, no one is sure how many
parents are willing to invest big on Nintendo and other more
expensive video systems.
   The biggest question is whether the new systems, which offer
more advanced technology and more sophisticated graphics and sound
effects than Nintendo, can take market share from the industry
leader.
   Children who have tired of Nintendo games - or whose Nintendo
systems have worn out - are asking for the new units, known as
16-bit systems. A bit is the smallest unit of information in a
computer, and 16-bit systems can process more information and
instructions than eight-bit systems like Nintendo.
   The 16-bit systems, which include NEC Corp.'s TurboGrafx-16 and
Sega's Genesis, must overcome a big obstacle - their price.
   The basic Genesis unit has a list price of $189.95, while the
basic TurboGrafx-16 goes for $159. Those prices don't include game
cartridges, which can run $50 or more apiece.
   In comparison, Nintendo looks like a bargain. Its basic unit can
be found for under $100 in many stores, and many of its cartridges
sell at a discount because there is a glut of them on the market.
   Nintendo's hand-held model, Game Boy, also has a price edge over
its new competitor, NEC's TurboExpress. Game Boy has a list price
of $100 while TurboExpress lists for $249.
   It all comes down to how much parents want to indulge their
children and how much they can and want to spend.
   Manufacturers say they already are feeling the effects of a
cautious consumer.
   ``In a normal year, retailers in October would purchase enough
to take them all the way through Christmas,'' said Ken Wirt, NEC's
vice president for home entertainment.
   But this year, he said, storeowners so far have ordered enough
merchandise to last them only through the Thanksgiving weekend.
   Paul Valentine, an analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., said
manufacturers of traditional toys, such as dolls and action
figures, have had similar experiences.
   ``The turmoil in the retail industry has definitely had an
impact on the toy industry,'' he said.
   But some traditional toys are expected to be sure winners this
season, analysts say.
   Children's love affair with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is
continuing, so the Playmates Toys Inc. action figures and their
spinoffs, which include videos, books, clothes, watches and games,
should do well.
   The Simpsons are expected to be found in varying forms under
plenty of Christmas trees. Manufacturers have licenses from the
producers of the popular television series for a range of
merchandise including dolls and plastic figures.
   Dolls based on the rock group New Kids on the Block have been
selling well ever since their introduction earlier this year by
Hasbro Inc., and they're expected to be a hit again at Christmas.
   Barbie, Mattel Inc.'s long-reigning queen of toys, continues to
dominate the doll business, with new outfits, a swimming pool and
her own Corvette among the offerings.
   Meanwhile, there's been an explosion of baby and toddler dolls
as that segment continues to thrive. A parent shopping in a
well-stocked toy department or store may dozens of dolls to choose
from, with most ranging from $20 to about $60.
   There are dolls that drink, wet their diapers, fall down, cry,
shiver or take baths, and dolls that can be dressed up, made up or
have their hair dyed. The toy companies have tried to outdo one
another in making their dolls stand out. Hasbro created Baby Uh-Oh,
which soils its diapers after it has been fed. The idea turns some
adults off, but little girls love it and the dolls have been
selling well, according to Valentine.
   Another toymaker, Ideal, has aimed straight for mothers'
heartstrings by bringing back some of the most popular dolls from
30 years ago: Betsy Wetsy, one of the drink-and-wet dolls of the
early 1960s, and Tiny Tears, who weeps having her bottle.
   Besides video games and Ninja Turtles and other action figures,
boys are expected to receive toys based on Hulk Hogan and other
wrestling stars. Standard &amp; Poor's Valentine said Tonka Inc.'s
Wrestling Buddies and Hasbro's World Wrestling Federation figures
have sold well.

<HEAD>Reorganized Pharmaceutical Company Posts $24 Million Net Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WASHINGTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc., the newly
created pharmaceutical giant, on Wednesday reported third-quarter
net income of $24 million, or 36 cents a share, on sales of $838
million.
   The company resulted from the merger of Rhone-Poulenc's human
pharmaceutical businesses and Rorer Group Inc., which was completed
July 31.
   Rorer alone made $19.6 million on $260 million in sales in the
third quarter of 1989. Net income included a pre-tax gain of $23
million from the sale of assets.
   Including Rhone-Poulenc's human pharmaceuticals business from
the third quarter last year, the new company's sales for this
quarter were up 21 percent and income was up 33 percent, the
company said. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, sales
grew 6.4 percent.
   ``Our new organization structure is firmly in place and
activities are under way to consolidate and streamline operations
worldwide,'' said Robert E. Cawthorn, the company's chairman,
president and chief executive officer.
   ``In addition, we have fully integrated research and development
activities,'' he said. ``Financially, our objective remains to at
least break even in 1990 in spite of the exceptional restructuring
charges.''
   For the first nine months, the company reported a net loss of
$162 million after pre-tax restructuring and special charges of
$289 million in the first half of the year.
   Sales for the first nine months were $1.8 billion.

<HEAD>Woolworth Earnings Up; Toys R Us Profits Flat</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Retail Sales, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Woolworth Corp. said Wednesday its third-quarter earnings rose
14 percent and Toys R Us Inc. reported its profits were flat as
both retailers were adversely affected by the slowdown in consumer
spending.
   Woolworth fared better than several other retailers who reported
their earnings fell as sales slumped during the third quarter. But
the company said it got a boost in part from gains in earnings from
its overseas operations.
   U.S. consumers, who were already spending cautiously because of
the faltering economy, sharply curtailed their purchases of
clothing, furniture, toys and appliances after the Middle East
crisis erupted and sent oil prices sharply higher.
   May Department Stores Co. and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. reported
Tuesday their third-quarter earnings fell because of sluggish
sales.
   Retailers and industry analysts expect consumers to spend
conservatively even during the Christmas shopping season. That
could spell trouble for the storeowners, who depend on holiday
sales for half their annual profits.

   Woolworth said it earned $80 million, or 62 cents per share, in
the quarter ended Oct. 27, up 14 percent from $70 million, or 54
cents per share, in the same period a year ago.
   Revenue rose to $2.47 billion from $2.17 billion.
   Woolworth reported declines in its general merchandise sales in
the United States, but said these were offset by gains in its
Kinney shoe division in this country and in its European stores.
   For the first nine months, Woolworth reported earnings of $168
million, or $1.30 per share, up from $154 million, or $1.19 per
share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose to $6.73 billion from $6.03 billion.
   Besides its Woolworth general merchandise stores, the company
operates specialty stores including Foot Locker and Lady Foot
Locker sportwear stores and Kinney shoe stores.

   Toys R Us said it earned nearly $28.73 million, or 10 cents per
share, in the quarter ended Oct. 28, compared with $28.69 million,
or 10 cents per share, in the same quarter of 1989.
   Sales at the nation's biggest toy retailer totaled $1.05
billion, up from $916.2 million.
   The company's sales, especially at its Kids R Us children's
clothing stores, stalled after the Persian Gulf crisis began.
However, toy retailers are expected to fare somewhat better than
general merchandise and apparel retailers during the Christmas
season.
   Toys R Us said it earned $88.4 million, or 30 cents per share,
in the first nine months of the year, up from $79.3 million, or 27
cents per share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Sales totaled $2.96 billion, up from $2.46 billion.
   The company has 451 toy stores in the United States, 98 in other
countries and 164 clothing stores.

<TEXT>
   The Farm Credit System, the federally chartered
cooperative banking network that provides most of the nation's
agricultural loans, reported Wednesday a 41 percent drop in
third-quarter earnings.
   Net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 totaled $93 million,
down from $158 million in the comparable period a year ago. For the
first nine months of 1990, the system earned $455 million, compared
with $514 million a year earlier.
   Income before an extraordinary loss related to a repurchase of
debt totaled $132 million in the current quarter, and $494 million
during the nine-month period.
   The system reported net interest income of $288 million in the
quarter, up from $236 million last year. But the improvement was
offset by a reduction in the negative provision for loan losses.
The provision was $4 million, compared to $76 million in last
year's third quarter.
   The system is cooperatively owned by its farm borrowers and is
made up of 37 regional banks that issue operating and mortgage
loans through local land bank associations and production credit
associations.

   The stock market climbed to an eight-week high
Wednesday, resuming its recent rally with encouragement from
falling oil prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 24.25 points to
2,559.65, its highest close since it stood at 2,571.29 on Sept. 18.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
999 up, 532 down and 473 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 179.31 million
shares, up from 160.24 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 214.70 million shares.
   The price of crude oil for December delivery dropped almost $2 a
barrel, to $31.16 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Prices of many other commodities, which didn't join oil in its
summer upsurge, have also been falling of late.
   That has helped to ease inflation worries on Wall Street, and
fueled hopes that the Federal Reserve would see more and more
leeway to relax its credit policy.
   Interest rates have been falling steadily in the credit markets
amid expectations of easier credit. Prices of long-term government
bonds moved up slightly Wednesday, lowering their yields to the
neighborhood of 8.5 percent.
   Declining interest rates have proved particularly helpful for
bank and other financial stocks that had been deeply depressed by
credit-crunch fears and worries about a weak real estate market.

<TEXT>
   Government lawyers charged Wednesday that a
former Philips Industries Inc. executive avoided nearly $570,000 in
personal losses by selling company stock while he had inside
information.
   Robert H. Brethen, a former Philips vice chairman, is accused of
selling the stock when he knew that a proposed leveraged buyout was
in jeopardy because of low earnings projections.
   During opening statements at Brethen's civil trial, Securities
and Exchange Commission attorney Jim Tyne said Brethen sold 109,733
shares of Philips stock in January while possessing information
about the projections.
   The SEC sued Brethen in federal court in February. The agency is
asking U.S. District Judge Walter Rice to order Brethen to give up
the $570,000 plus interest and to pay a $1.7 million penalty.
   Tyne said Brethen, who retired last December, knew through
internal reports that company officials were forecasting lower
earnings in the fall of 1989 and that Philips was failing to meet
the lower projections.
   Tyne also said Brethen knew that failure to meet the projections
threatened a proposed leveraged buyout of the Dayton-based building
and transportation products maker by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners
Inc.
   ``No one outside the company ... knew these projections, and
particularly the public didn't know about these projections,'' Tyne
said.
   But David Cupps, Brethen's attorney, said questions about the
financing for the buyout as well as changes in Philips' operating
costs were included in a public proxy statement filed Dec. 20,
1989. ``That disclosure was not secret,'' he said.
   Cupps said published reports had stated that banks were backing
away from helping to finance the buyout.
   William McCanna, Philips chief operations officer, testified
that Brethen had access to three sales forecasts prepared by the
company in October 1989 that were decreasingly optimistic. He said
the forecasts were not public.
   Tyne said Brethen was told by company officials shortly before
he retired that Merrill Lynch was disappointed with the company's
third-quarter earnings and there could be difficulties arranging
bank financing.
   ``Right after his retirement, he started talking to lawyers
about selling his stock,'' Tyne said.
   Tyne said one attorney told Brethen the information was
confidential and another told him he shouldn't sell his stock.
``The evidence will show he was warned not to sell his stock,'' he
said.
   The government alleges Brethen sold 100,000 shares of Philips
stock at $22 per share on Jan. 9 and an additional 9,000 shares at
$19 per share two days later.
   At the end of trading that day, Philips announced Merrill Lynch
was unable to proceed with the buyout because of Philips'
third-quarter earnings. The price of Philips stock fell to $15.50
per share the next day.
   Tyne said Brethen later told the SEC he sold the stock to pay
off some debts, but that evidence shows he had enough assets to
cover those obligations.
   Last August, Philips shareholders approved the acquisition of
the company by Tomkins PLC of the United Kingdom.

<HEAD>Chrysler, Time Warner Agree on Multimedia Marketing Package</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. has signed up for a multimedia
marketing package from Time Warner Inc. that will draw upon the
media and entertainment giant's far-flung interests in magazines,
records, movies, videos and cable TV.
   Under terms of the deal, Chrysler will tout cars and trucks in
multi-page advertising inserts or special issues of magazines such
as People, Time and Fortune and in commercials on Time Warner's
cable TV systems.
   Chrysler also will be given the chance to place its products in
Warner Bros. films and to offer Warner Bros. records, Time-Life
Books and Time-Life videos as premiums in such promotions as
getting people to take a test drive.
   Spokesmen for Chrysler and Time Warner said the program was the
biggest marketing package Time Warner has assembled for a single
advertiser.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed but it was believed to be
in the $40 million range covering two years starting in 1991.
   Diversified media companies such as Time Warner, created last
year with Time Inc.'s acquisition of Warner Communications Inc.,
have often argued that their vast array of media holdings make them
more attractive to advertisers.
   Those capabilities have taken on even more importance in recent
months as the advertising market has slumped and media companies
scramble to compensate by tailoring programs that suit particular
advertiser's needs.
   While the details of some of Chrysler's plans with Time Warner
remain to be worked out, the companies said one of them will
involve placing multiple-page inserts in several of Time Warner's
magazines each quarter.
   They said the inserts will carry a ``Rediscover America'' theme
marking the approaching celebration of the 500th anniversary of
Columbus' discovery of America.
   In connection with the inserts, Chrysler plans to underwrite
referenda on issues such as energy, the environment and education.
   Both the ad inserts and the referenda should heighten consumer
awareness of Chrysler's products, said Tom Jakobowski, a spokesman
for Chrsylser.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCA Inc. stock climbed Wednesday after a
published report suggested talks are intensifying over the
possibility that Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. will
make a definitive bid to acquire the entertainment company.
   MCA and Matsushita confirmed in September they were in talks
about a buyout and there was speculation the Japanese electronics
manufacturer would offer about $85 a share for MCA, owner of
Universal Pictures and Universal Television.
   In trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, MCA rose $3
a share to close at $65.50.
   The Wall Street Journal reported that officials of MCA and
Matsushita have scheduled talks for Monday and hope to agree within
days on terms of a buyout.
   A spokeswoman for MCA in Universal City, Calif., said the
company had no comment on the report; a spokesman for Matsushita
failed to return a phone call.
   With about 92 million shares outstanding, a bid of $85 a share
would value MCA at about $7.8 billion.
   The Journal story said that a specific price is still up for
negotiation, and it cautioned that there is no certainty that a
deal will be negotiated or that the timetable will be followed.
   If a deal were worked out, it would be the latest example of
foreign ownership of a major American movie studio.
   In the biggest such deal to date, Japan's Sony Corp. bought
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. last year for $3.4 billion
plus debt that raised the total value of the deal to about $5
billion.

<HEAD>Federal Agency Approves Iroquois Pipeline</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS `state of Connecticut' to `Department of Energy' in
12th graf, Iroquois still. Picks up 13th graf, A Hudson.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $583 million pipeline that would pump
Canadian natural gas to the Northeast won federal approval
Wednesday over objections from Hudson Valley and Connecticut
property-owners whose land would be crossed.
   The unanimous decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission in favor of the Iroquois pipeline came after four years
of debate among environmentalists, homeowners and rival energy
suppliers.
   Opponents included oil wildcatters in the Southwest as well as
psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers, whose Hudson Valley estate would
be crossed by the pipeline.
   But tight energy supplies in New England, New York and New
Jersey apparently outweighed environmental arguments and the
protests of domestic oil and gas suppliers.
   ``The gas is needed in the area to be served by Iroquois,'' said
FERC Chairman Martin Allday. ``It is my personal goal to get pipe
in the ground to serve customers.''
   FERC board member Jerry Langdon said the decision would help
move the United States toward relying on energy supplies in North
America, if not within its own borders.
   ``Canada is going to play a role in our natural gas supply in
the future and I think that the Iroquois Pipeline is going to be an
integral part of that,'' Langdon said.
   Supporters of the project include Massachusetts Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., and New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo.
   The pipeline will extend 370 miles from the St. Lawrence River
through the woodlands of Upstate New York, beneath the Hudson
River, into affluent sections of western Connecticut and across
Long Island Sound to Long Island. Iroquois officials hope to have
gas flowing to New York and New England by November 1991 and to
complete the line by January 1992.
   ``It's a great day,'' said Robert J. Reid, president of the
Iroquois Gas Transmission System, a consortium of U.S. and Canadian
gas companies and utilities based in Shelton, Conn. ``It was
imperative that we receive FERC approval in November to maintain
our timetable for constructing the pipeline.''
   Iroquois is designed to deliver 575 million cubic feet of gas
daily, or enough to meet the energy needs of 1.5 million homes.
   Iroquois still has regulatory hurdles to clear including permits
from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Energy.
Thousands of property owners along the route have not yet agreed to
let Iroquois pay for right-of-way privileges across their land.
Iroquois may have to settle some of those cases in court.
   A Hudson Valley citizens group called GASP has promised to file
an immediate appeal with FERC and, if that fails, to appeal the
decision in federal court.
   Domestic energy suppliers complained that Iroquois will
discourage domestic energy exploration and production and will
compete unfairly with U.S. pipelines and oil companies.
   Iroquois' affiliates include Connecticut Natural Gas Corp.,
Brooklyn Union Gas Co., TransCanada PipeLines Ltd., and the New
York Power Authority. Customers include Long Island Lighting Co.,
Boston Gas Co., and Consolidated Edison Co. of New York.

<HEAD>Southland's Losses Mount in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southland Corp., which filed for bankruptcy last
month, said Wednesday it lost nearly twice as much money in the
third quarter as it did in the same period last year.
   Southland showed a smaller loss for the nine months that ended
Sept. 30 than in the same period of 1989, however, and it reported
higher revenues.
   Southland owns 7-Eleven, the nation's largest convenience store
chain.
   The company lost $122.5 million, or 61 cents a share, on revenue
of $2.26 billion in the third quarter. That compares to a loss of
$63.4 million, or 33 cents a share, on revenue of $2.23 billion in
the same quarter a year ago.
   The burden of paying off a $4.9 billion takeover financed with
debt forced the company to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
last month. The filing allows Southland to operate under court
supervision while it develops a plan to pay creditors.
   Southland submitted a ``prepackaged'' reorganization plan that
had won approval from 90 percent of its creditors. U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Harold C. Abramson set a Dec. 14 confirmation hearing for the
plan.
   On Wednesday, the company said it had sufficient working capital
to maintain normal operations at its convenience stores,
distribution and food centers.
   Sales at comparable stores rose 1.1 percent during the quarter
and 2.4 percent during the first nine months. But gross profits
from those sales declined in the quarter and was up only slightly
for the nine months because there were fewer 7-Eleven stores.
   For the nine-month period, Southland lost $250.0 million, or
$1.26 a share, on revenue of $6.35 billion. In the 1989 period it
lost $299.8 million, or $1.55 a share, on revenue of $6.29 billion.

<HEAD>Attorneys Meet to Discuss $700 Million Suit Against Chevron USA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys representing both sides in a $700
million class-action lawsuit against Chevron USA Corp. met for the
first time Wednesday under a federal judge's order, a lawyer said.
   The attorneys, who discussed the lawsuit for about six hours,
planned to meet again Thursday, said Jo Wilson, attorney for the
plaintiffs, who would not comment on the discussions.
   ``We're hopeful we will be able to report some progress to the
judge on Monday,'' she said.
   The lawsuit was filed in 1986 on behalf of more than 40,000
former Gulf Oil Corp. employees, retirees and Chevron employees who
previously worked for Gulf and their family members.
   Plaintiffs allege San Francisco-based Chevron violated the
federal Employment Retirement Income Security Act when it merged
the Chevron and Gulf pension plans two years after it acquired Gulf
Oil, of Pittsburgh.
   They also complained that many Gulf employees who did not end up
with jobs at Chevron were unjustly denied pension benefits.
   Ms. Wilson has said the Gulf plan had $700 million in surplus
funds when Chevron merged the plans in 1986. Since the merger, she
said, Gulf retirees have found their benefits reduced by about 20
percent.
   Chevron attorneys say the company has not touched any of the
money in the merged pension fund for other corporate purposes, and
an ongoing pension plan cannot have excess assets.
   U.S. District Judge Simeon T. Lake III last week ordered
attorneys from both sides and Chevron officials to begin
negotiations ``in good faith towards a settlement,'' Ms. Wilson
said.
   Houston attorney Robert J. Malinak, who represents Chevron in
the case, did not return a telephone call Wednesday.

   A subsidiary of Amax Inc. has agreed to buy the
capital stock of Ladd Petroleum Corp. for $515 million, the
companies said Wednesday.
   Ladd, a subsidiary of General Electric Co., is an oil and
natural gas producer in the United States and Canada. It has 650
miles of pipelines and proven and probable reserves of about 500
billion cubic feet.
   The Ladd stock will be purchased by Amax Oil &amp; Gas Inc., a
Houston-based Amax subsidiary with interests in 1,500 natural gas
wells and about 500 billion cubic feet of gas reserves.
   Allen Born, Amax's chairman and chief exeuctive officer, said
Ladd's assets and operations will make a good strategic fit with
his company's and provide Amax with a strong position in the
natural gas marketplace. Both firms' properties are concentrated in
the Gulf Coast, Texas and Oklahoma.
   The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.

   Eastern Airlines, its survival on the line,
Wednesday reported a net loss of $252.8 million for the third
quarter.
   The carrier said two major non-recurring items had an enormous
impact on the quarter, with Eastern gaining $212.3 million on
assets sales and losing $284.8 million to a settlement with the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. on the company's fixed benefit
pension plans.
   The net loss without those two items was $180.3 million, Eastern
said. The company reported $518.3 million in operating revenues for
the quarter ending Sept. 30.
   The carrier said year-earlier figures weren't directly
comparable because of the March 1989 strike, which drastically
curtailed the airline's operations for months. It has been
operating under bankruptcy court protection since then.
   Eastern said its quarterly performance also suffered from a
near-doubling of fuel prices in August and September, stemming from
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   For the first nine months of 1990, Eastern's operating revenues
were $1.621 billion with a net loss of $424.9 million, after a gain
of $361.3 million on the sale of assets and after the $284.8
million charge in the pension settlement.
   For the same period in 1989, Eastern had operating revenues of
$1.016 billion, with a net loss of $569.7 million.

<TEXT>
   Starcraft Corp., a recreational vehicle
company, filed for protection from creditors in federal bankruptcy
court Wednesday, blaming high gasoline prices, the threat of war,
and a weakening economy.
   Chairman Michael Bell said he expects Starcraft and its
subsidiaries will pay off their debts and emerge from
court-directed reorganization ``in a healthy condition.''
   In a statement released through the company's attorneys, Bell
cited ``high and fluctuating domestic gasoline prices, the ongoing
Middle East crisis and the perception of an approaching economic
recession.''
   Van conversions, an important segment of Starcraft's business,
shrank at least 30 percent in September, a month after Iraqi troops
invaded Kuwait and gasoline prices began rising, according to Ford
Motor Co. and General Motors Corp., the largest suppliers of van
chassis to the conversion industry.
   Last month Starcraft laid off 30 employees at its headquarters.
The company employs about 400 people at offices and a van
conversion plant in Goshen, Ind., and about 300 at a travel trailer
and motorhome plant in Topeka, Ind.
   The company earlier had closed production facilities in
Corcoran, Calif., and Delhi, La.
   Last year Starcraft began production of an expensive line of
motorhomes, some of which retail in the range of $100,000, just as
demand began falling, but chief financial officer Richard Newberry
said last month he expected to sell the remaining inventory.
   Starcraft had failed to make a $2.1 million interest payment to
bondholders in mid-July, and Bell entered talks with holders of $25
million of 16.5 percent notes.
   In his statement, Bell said the ``major financial lender to
Starcraft Corp. has entered an agreement to continue working
capital availability to the companies.''
   Starcraft subsidiaries are Starcraft Van Conversions Corp.,
Starcraft Recreational Products Corp., and Starcraft Transportation
Corp.

   Gold futures prices tumbled Wednesday on New York's Commodity
Exchange in a session marked by growing recession fears and
reaction to White House actions concerning the situation in the
Persian Gulf.
   On other commodities markets, silver, platinum and energy
futures prices slipped; grains and soybeans prices collapsed;
cattle futures rose; and pork futures were mixed.
   Gold settled $8.70 to $8.50 lower with December at $378.50 a
troy ounce.
   Gold began falling in early trading amid profit-taking from
Tuesday's gains and closed sharply lower after trading was stopped
several times by an automatically triggered mechanism activated
when prices go below a set figure.
   ``Basically, two events caused the drop,'' said Peter Cardillo,
director of commodities research for Jesup, Josephtal &amp; Co. Inc. in
New York. ``There was confusion over whether or not the Federal
Reserve has eased interest rates and statements out of the White
House suggesting they were not going to call a special session of
Congress to debate the gulf crisis.''
   Silver and platinum prices followed gold, Cardillo said. Silver
settled 4.3 cents to 3.4 cents lower with December at $4.175 an
ounce. Platinum settled $5.90 lower across the board with January
at $413.90.
   Energy futures also fell the New York Mercantile Exchange on
recessionary fears and continued attention to events connected to
the Persian Gulf.
   Light sweet crude settled $1.96 to 26 cents lower with December
at $31.16 a barrel; heating oil settled 1.91 cents to 1.36 cents
lower with December at 86.64 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
settled 2.72 cents to 1.41 cents lower with December at 80.39 cents
a gallon.
   Grains and soybeans futures prices tumbled for the fourth
consecutive session on the Chicago Board of Trade as speculators
fretted over abundant supplies and poor demand.
   Follow-through selling from Tuesday's poor close pressured
futures throughout the day as commercial firms cashed in, in light
of good harvesting weather in the regions where the crops are
grown.
   Corn, soybeans and wheat are all suffering from near-record
harvests and little export demand, and prices have slumped as
speculators move to the sidelines waiting for activity.
   ``We haven't seen any things confirmed in terms of export
activity,'' said Mark Weidner, an analyst for Cargill Investor
Services Inc. ``Without confirmation or seeing shipments going out,
rumors of activity will be just that and we'll continue to see
falling prices.''
   Soybeans also have suffered from a government report issued last
week that found a higher than expected supply of the crop than was
previously expected.
   Reports of Taiwan's purchase of 20,000 tons of the crop and talk
that Israel and Mexico also may be in the market failed to slow the
future's slide.
   Wheat futures settled 7} cents to 6 cents lower with December at
$2.55\ a bushel; corn futures were 6\ cents to 5 cents lower with
December at $2.24 a bushel; oats were 5\ cents to 4 cents lower
with December at $1.07} a bushel; soybeans were 10{ cents to 5}
cents lower with November at $5.54\ a bushel.
   Cattle futures prices were spurred another day by strong cash
market sales on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, but pork futures
prices were mixed to lower as trade took profits on gains made this
week.
   Live cattle settled .15 cent to .55 cent higher with December at
79.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle was .20 cent to .80 cent higher
with November at 88.55 cents a pound; hogs were .60 cent lower to
.25 cent higher with December at 53.90 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.02 cents to .10 cent lower with February at 72.05
cents a pound.

<HEAD>Bally Reports $84.7 Million Loss, Misses Loan Payment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bally Manufacturing Corp. on Wednesday reported a
third-quarter loss of $84.7 million and said the company missed an
$18.4 million payment to bondholders.
   The Chicago-based company said the loss of $3.02 per share for
the three months ending Sept. 30 compared with a loss of $3.71
million, or 21 cents per share, for the same period a year ago.
   The results for the latest quarter included $9.1 million in
litigation costs and a $69 million write-off in intangible assets,
all related to a missed payment Oct. 15 on $1.8 billion in debt
from a restructuring of Bally's Nevada casino subsidiary.
   Wednesday ended a 30-day grace period for Bally to make the loan
payment, said Bally spokeswoman Janie Lewis. She said the company
was ``still in negotiations with our bondholders'' on a debt
restructuring plan.
   The third-quarter 1989 results included an $8.4 million expense
associated with the refinancing of Bally's Park Place casino hotel
in Atlantic City.
   Excluding extraordinary items, Bally posted a net loss of $6.5
million in the third quarter compared with a gain of $4.7 million a
year ago.
   Third-quarter revenues rose to $531.3 million from $530.4
million, Bally said in a statement.
   Bally operates four casino hotels and numerous fitness centers
across the country and also markets a line of gaming equipment  of
securities fraud at sentencing by U.S. District Judge Miriam
Goldman Cedarbaum.
   Mulheren did not address the court before sentencing. He relied
on statements by Puccio, who asked for leniency because Mulheren
suffered from manic depression and because of his many charitable
acts.
   ``The most we have here is someone who momentarily strayed and
committed one act on one day against a lifetime of honesty and
respectability,'' Puccio said.
   Cedarbaum said Mulheren's crimes required incarceration.
``Anyone who tampers with the integrity of the stock market will go
to prison.''
   After sentencing Mulheren to a year and one day in prison,
Cedarbaum allowed him to remain free pending appeal. If his
conviction is upheld, it is unlikely Mulheren will serve the entire
sentence because he will be eligible for parole after serving four
months.
   Asked his reaction to the sentence, Mulheren said, ``Nobody
likes to go to jail, right?''
   Prosecutors had charged that Mulheren bought 75,000 Gulf &amp;
Western shares at Boesky's behest, driving the stock to $45 a
share, the price at which Boesky wanted to sell about 3.5 million
shares back to the company.
   Boesky - the ex-stock speculator whose admissions led to several
prominent indictments on Wall Street - agreed in 1986 to plead
guilty to one count of lying to federal investigators and pay $100
million in fines. He was released from custody in April after
serving two years of a three-year term.
   The high point of Mulheren's trial came when Boesky was called
as a prosecution witness against his former business associate and
friend. Boesky admitted he traded suitcases stuffed with cash for
confidential information about imminent takeovers.
   Mulheren, a laid-back multimillionaire who often flew by
helicopter to his trial, flouted convention in court as he had in
his Wall Street career. During testimony, Mulheren wore a tennis
shirt, blue jeans and boat shoes.
   In 1988, after learning Boesky had implicated him, Mulheren was
arrested leaving his Rumson, N.J., mansion carrying a loaded
assault rifle. Police said he planned to shoot Boesky.
   Authorities in New Jersey last year dropped weapons possession
charges. Mulheren's lawyers blamed the incident, which was not
disclosed at the trial, on his failure to take lithium prescribed
to treat manic depression.
   Some criminal charges against Mulheren remain because the jury
was unable to reach a verdict on 26 additional counts of securities
fraud, mail fraud and record-keeping violations.
   Cedarbaum declared a mistrial on that portion of the case and
the government has yet to decide whether to retry Mulheren on the
pending counts.
   Those charges alleged Mulheren ``parked'' for Boesky securities
of Unocal Corp., Warner Communications Inc., Storer Communications
Inc., Boise Cascade Corp., American Hospital Supply Inc. and R.H.
Macy &amp; Co.
   Parking is the illegal practice of disguising ownership of
securities to avoid federal reporting requirements.
   Mulheren's co-defendant, Leonard DeStefano, 34, a former trader
at Mulheren's defunct firm Jamie Securities Co., was acquitted of
all conspiracy and record-keeping violations charges brought
against him.

<HEAD>Western Union Losses Continue to Grow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western Union's losses continued
to grow in the third quarter, doubling because of the company's
huge debt, the communications firm said Wednesday.
   Western Union said its loss for the three-month period ending
Sept. 30 was $26.6 million, or 42 cents a share, on revenues of
$145 million. In the same period last year, the company lost $13.1
million, or 47 cents a share, on revenue of $157 million.
   Many preferred stock shareholders converted their securities
into common stock, raising the number of outstanding shares and
affecting the earnings per share figure.
   The losses stem from debt load the company has been forced to
carry for the past six years, spokesman Warren R. Bechtel said
Wednesday.
   Fees to financial advisers, lawyers and other services are also
piling up as the company tries to restructure the debt, he said.
   Preparing for a threatened strike by the Communications Workers
of America in August also ate into third quarter earnings, Bechtel
said.
   The biggest revenue loser was Telex, Bechtel said, although he
would not specify the revenues and expenses of each of Western
Union's business and financial services.
   For the first nine months of the year, Western Union lost $72.3
million, or $1.22 per share, on revenues of $436.3 million. In the
same period last year, Western Union lost $18.1 million, or $1.12
per share, on revenue of $474.1 million.

   Federal transportation officials gave final
approval Wednesday to United Airlines' planned new routes between
Chicago and Tokyo.
   The Department of Transportation approved the routes over the
objections of American Airlines, which had sought to offer the
service.
   United applied two years ago for permission to offer non-stop
service between the two cities.
   ``We are elated by the final decision to entrust this valuable
route to United,'' said Stephen M. Wolf, chairman of UAL Inc., the
parent company of United Airlines.
   United plans to begin the new flights Jan. 8, using new 747-400
aircraft and offering same-plane service to Washington, D.C.'s
Dulles International Airport.

   McDonald's Corp. on Wednesday announced it is
test marketing a low-fat hamburger that trade groups said could
help woo health-conscious consumers.
   But nutrition experts cautioned that the efforts of McDonald's
and its competitors, such as Hardee's and Wendy's, do not mean
fast-food has become health food.
   The new hamburger, called the Lean Deluxe, boasts a 91 percent
fat-free beef patty. Counting the sesame seed bun and fixings -
ketchup, mustard, pickles, onions, lettuce and tomatoes - it has a
10.5 percent fat content and 310 calories. That compares to a 20.7
percent fat content and about 410 calories in a Quarter Pounder.
   The burger is currently being test-marketed in 54 franchises in
the Harrisburg, Pa. area, said Chuck Rubner, a spokesman for the
Oak Brook, Ill.-based company.
   ``We're excited about it and are very optimistic,'' Rubner said.
``They like the taste of the product and they like the fact that
it's a low-fat alternative.''
   There currently are no plans to nationally market the hamburger.
   The patty is composed of 90 percent lean beef, 9 percent water
and 1 percent seasonings, Rubner said.
   Among the items listed as seasonings is carrageenan, a gum-like
product used in meats and other foods to bind the ingredients.
   The carrageenan, which does the binding job of fat, is the
secret to the patty, said Mary Adolf, a spokeswoman for the Beef
Industry Council of the Meat Board. The board funded work by Auburn
University to develop the low-fat beef and Ms. Adolf said
McDonald's is the first to test-market the technology.
   Hardee's Food Systems Inc. earlier this year test marketed in
four cities an 84 percent fat-free hamburger and plans to sell it
nationally in 1991, said John Merritt, a spokesman for the Rocky
Mountain, N.C.-based company.
   The Dallas-based American Heart Association and the Center for
Science in the Public Interest in Washington, D.C., said there
currently is no other fast-food chain marketing a hamburger with as
low a fat content as McDonald's claims.
   Nutrition experts welcomed the development, but cautioned that
one new product in a menu loaded with fat and cholesterol is not a
healthy substitute.
   ``One has to look at a food's place in relation to the total
diet,'' said Karen Miller-Kovach, a spokeswoman for the American
Dietetic Association. ``If you go into a restaurant, order the
(fat-free) burger and an extra-large order of fries, then you may
not be doing yourself any favor.''
   The new hamburger also does little to reduce sodium content,
said Michael Jacobson, director of the Center for Science in the
Public Interest.
   ``The (regular) Quarter Pounder has 660 milligrams of sodium,''
compared to 650 milligrams in the Lean Deluxe. ``That level is what
I consider a dangerously unhealthy amount,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   Miller-Kovach said the Lean Deluxe is part of a growing health
trend for fast-food companies like McDonald's and Wendy's, which
recently introduced a grilled chicken breast sandwich.
   ``What we're seeing is a change in the fast-food menu - not
necessarily away from the old-time fat-filled and greasy foods that
have made fast-food companies fat and happy - but to provide other
alternatives for customers,'' she said.
   Rubner noted that McDonald's has also added low-fat milkshakes
and yogurt, whole grain cereals and switched to cooking its french
fries in all-vegetable oils instead of beef tallow.
