<HEAD>Amusement Parks Wage Battle of Primal Screams With Scary Roller
Coasters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It's the battle of the monster roller
coasters, white-knucklers designed to scare you silly, and it's
just in time for youngsters on spring vacation to buy a thrill.
   But at $17-plus, these thrills aren't cheap.
   Thirty miles from downtown Los Angeles, in opposite directions,
the Knott's Berry Farm and Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement parks
are fighting to outdo each other by unleashing multimillion-dollar
fright machines.
   Knott's, to the southeast in Buena Park, promises its new $5
million Boomerang coaster will elicit ``the primal scream.'' Magic
Mountain at Valencia, to the northwest, says its $8 million Viper
coaster provides ``the most frightening ride on earth.''
   They are the latest in the nation's decade-long competition to
see who can build the biggest, fastest and scariest amusement park
attraction.
   The battle sometimes ends up in court. In Allentown, Pa., the
Dorney Park amusement park recently filed a lawsuit in federal
court to stop Six Flags Over Texas from claiming it has the
nation's tallest wooden roller coaster.
   Advertisements claim the $5.5 million Texas Giant coaster is the
highest at 143 feet, compared with 95 feet for Dorney's Hercules
coaster. But Dorney Park insists Hercules is 157 feet, because it
drops over a cliff, and the Texas Giant 137 feet.
   ``Coaster enthusiasts go all over the country looking for
moments of negative gravity,'' said Paul Ruben, editor of Roller
Coaster! magazine. He planned to be on hand today when Viper opens
to the public.
   ``Viper is a megacoaster that precisely defines the next step in
roller coaster evolution. Viper is, quite simply, the ultimate
scream machine,'' said Magic Mountain president Joseph Schillaci.
   Viper sends cars racing 70 mph over a course that reaches 188
feet high and includes seven loops during a 2{-minute run.
   Padded over-the-shoulder locking harnesses keep passengers
inside and ``fail-safe air brakes'' on the track are computer
controlled to assure proper ride speed.
   Asked about the safety of Boomerang, which also has padded
shoulder harnesses, Knott's spokesman Stuart Zanville said
structural experts employed by the amusement parks examine thrill
rides daily. There are no checks by government agencies, although
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration does inspect
carnival rides.
   ``We've never had a ride-related fatality. Every ride is
inspected every single day by our safety inspectors,'' Zanville
said.
   Magic Mountain markets the Viper as the world's tallest looping
roller coaster. The nation's tallest roller coaster is the
205-foot-high Magnum XL 200 at the Cedar Point amusement park in
Sandusky, Ohio, but it doesn't loop.
   But the president of the 2,000-member American Coaster
Enthusiasts group says pacing, steepness and the severity of turns
are more important factors than size.
   ``You could have a ride 50 feet tall and it could scare the
beejeebees out of you,'' said Randy Geisler, the Chicago-based
association's leader.
   Knott's Berry Farm understandably agrees with Geisler _
Boomerang pales in size compared to Viper.
   Boomerang cars make the outbound and return trips on the same
875-foot-long track. Riders are first pulled backward to the top of
a 125-foot tower, then released to hurtle through three vertical
loops before ascending another tower for the ride back. It lasts 90
seconds.
   ``During the ride, you have the sensation that you actually have
fallen off the track. With ours, it's not the height or the speed,
it's how you feel when you get off,'' said Zanville.
   There are similar rides at Six Flags Over Texas near Dallas and
Canada's Wonderland theme park in Toronto.
   Roller coaster popularity peaked in the 1920s with more than
1,500 in operation in the United States. By 1978, only 147 were
left in North America.
   But there will be 203 coasters in operation by the end of this
year, with 17 new, moved or renovated ones opening.

<HEAD>Balmain Names Scotsman As New Designer For Ready-to-Wear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The house of Balmain has presented its new designer
for its ``Ivoire'' line of luxury ready-to-wear, Alistair Blair of
Scotland.
   He is well-known in Great Britain, having designed for Jaeger
and under his own label.
   ``His sketches won me over,'' said Alain Chevalier, who as
Balmain's resident has overseen a major financial restructuring
this year.
   Chevalier said he based his choice, announced Friday, on Blair's
creativity and experience, which includes nine years in Paris with
couture houses like Dior, Givenchy, Chloe and Karl Lagerfeld.
   This is the latest in various French fashion companies' bids to
boost fashion excitement and sales with new designers.
   The trend started in 1983, when Karl Lagerfeld made a splash at
Chanel, reviving the old name with his creative ideas.
   Last summer, Gianfranco Ferre took over as Dior's head designer.
The house of Lanvin is looking for original couture creativity from
Claude Montana.
   And Nina Ricci's ready-to-wear got a fresh approach with another
Englishman, Philip Waghorne.
   Erik Mortensen, Balmain's Danish-born designer, will keep his
post as head of haute couture, which he has occupied since Pierre
Balmain's death in 1982.
   His last ``Ivoire'' collection Wednesday was a low-keyed
presentation of a few beautifully made outfits.
   Among the suits a standout was the black faille number with hot
orange satin lapels turned back with a big button.
   In the sparkly evening wear, the hostess gown of gold guipure
lace over a spangled stripe skirt had charm worthy of the new New
York preference for taste over glitz.
   There also were remarkable black knits, pieced in swooping arcs,
buttoned up with gold and sporting tulip-split skirts.
   Now fashion buffs will be watching for Blair's October debut.
   ``I've given up my own label in England,'' said Blair, a
Francophile who grew up near Glasgow and trained at St. Martin's
School of Art.
   ``I feel Paris is indeed the fashion capital, the place to be
for any designer,'' he said.
   He wouldn't reveal his plans, but his recent work shows a
bright, bouncy approach without being too way-out for a couture
customer.
   Blair will move to Paris for his new job but will continue to
design for Jaeger and Ballantyne cashmeres.
   His first Balmain assignment is a trip to the United States next
week to win American prestige-store buyers. As yet, Balmain has
little representation in U.S. shops.
   Chevalier also announced plans for luxury ready-to-wear
expansion in the Far East, with stores coming up soon in Hong Kong,
Bangkok and Singapore.
   The Balmain label still has a classic image, but no matter what
creations Blair comes up with, the prices will remain in the
medium-expensive category _ about $1,000 for a suit retail.
   Chevalier also announced there would be a less expensive
sub-Ivoire line based on Blair's creations, as yet unnamed. Most
big names exploit less expensive lines, such as Saint Laurent's
``Variation.'' It is about a third less than the regular luxury
ready-to-wear.

<HEAD>Cordon Bleu To Recreate La Fayette's 1774 Wedding Dinner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The famed Paris cooking school Le Cordon Bleu is
organizing a dinner in Washington to re-create the 1774 wedding
feast of the Marquis de La Fayette, the Frenchman who helped the
Americans win their revolution.
   The black-tie affair is planned for Wednesday, April 11, the
date on which La Fayette was married, at the residence of French
Ambassador Jacques Andreani, the cooking school announced Friday.
   Patrick Martin, a chef who teaches at Le Cordon Bleu, is
overseeing the preparation of the dinner. The menu will be selected
from the original 200 dishes served when La Fayette, then 16,
married Adrienne de Noailles.
   La Fayette ignored France's neutrality during the American
Revolution and traveled to the United States, where he fought
alongside the Americans. He gained the rank of major general and
became a close friend of George Washington.
   Le Cordon Bleu was founded in 1895 as a cooking school for the
cooks of wealthy French families.

<HEAD>Italy Says It Will Use Military to Guard Borders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government intends to deploy the armed forces to
halt the arrival of tens of thousands of illegal immigrants.
   The five-party governing coalition announced Friday that navy
ships will patrol Italy's coasts, and army soldiers will be posted
along the country's northeastern border. Italy has about 4,800
miles of coast and 600 miles of borderland.
   The government said the armed forces will work in collaboration
with the police.
   In recent years, an estimated 100,000 illegal immigrants, mostly
from Third World countries, have arrived in Italy each year,
officials say. Estimates of the total number of illegal immigrants
vary from 500,000 to 1.5 million.
   Italy has had difficulty absorbing the arrivals because of job
and housing shortages, as well as inadequate public health and
education services.
   There has been a recent wave of violence against immigrants,
particularly in the popular tourist city of Florence.

<HEAD>Wall Street Sour, Employees Sweet On UAL Buyout Plan</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhotos CX1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street is still waiting for assurance that
the UAL Corp.'s $4.38 billion buyout will go through, but the
company's employees say they're willing to accept the tough
concessions that are part of the deal.
   The unions making the purchase have neither financing
commitments nor a new management team, and some investors and
analysts say they won't take the new deal seriously until those
issues are nailed down.
   ``The question is, who is going to manage this thing and take it
to the banks?'' said analyst Jack Hunter of Howe Barnes Investments
Inc. in Chicago.
   Hunter said he believed the deal ultimately would go through,
but another airlines analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the deal's chances were ``50-50 at best.''
   Directors of UAL, the parent of United Airlines, announced an
agreement in principle Friday to sell the nation's second-largest
carrier to its 71,000 employees for cash and securities equal to
$201 a share, which would create the country's largest worker-owned
company.
   The stock market reflected investor skepticism the deal will be
done. After a strong opening, UAL closed $2 lower at $163.50 on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   The possibility the unions will dump UAL chairman and chief
executive Stephen Wolf was seen by some observers as the biggest
threat to a successful conclusion of the deal.
   Wolf is perceived as a capable airline manager despite his
abrasive relations with the unions.
   Frederick Dubinsky, chairman of the United chapter of the Air
Line Pilots Association, told a news conference in New York that
Wolf would be replaced.
   ``It's our intention to put together a top-notch senior
management team ... and that will include a new CEO,'' he said.
   But later in the day, union group spokesman Hank Krakowski said
the group had made no such decision.
   ``Our position is we're not including or precluding anyone from
any management team at this point,'' Krakowski said.
   The union group includes United's pilots, machinists and flight
attendants unions, which together represent about two-thirds of
UAL's employees.
   UAL will spin off to shareholders its entire 50 percent stake in
Covia, which is co-owned by a consortium of five other airlines and
operates an automated reservations system called Apollo.
   The agreement calls for employees to give up $2 billion in
concessions over five years.
   The unions would sign five-year contracts with no-strike
clauses. Other concessions include wage cuts of up to 7.69 percent
for flight attendants and machinists and up to 11 percent for
pilots.
   UAL's 25,700 non-union employees will negotiate their work
conditions with the union group, said their lawyer, Stephen Fraidin.
   Under the agreement, the pilots would own 37.9 percent of UAL;
machinists would own 35.7 percent, non-union employees about 14.3
percent and flight attendants about 12 percent, the unions said.
   The largest employee-owned company currently is Publix Inc., a
supermarket chain based in Lakeland, Fla., with 50,000 employees,
said Corey Rosen, executive director of the National Center for
Employee Ownership in Oakland, Calif.
   Some UAL Corp. employees said they were prepared to accept the
concessions that go along with the agreement.
   Frederick Dubinsky, head of United's pilot union, referred to
the concessions as ``sweat equity'' and said there ``is no other
decent alternative.''
   ``I would be willing to give up money, myself,'' said Donna, a
flight attendant interviewed at O'Hare International Airport who
would not give her full name. ``Ten percent would be too much, 5
percent would hurt, but I would be willing to take it.''
   ``We would never say no to job concessions,'' said another
flight attendant from Denver. ``But you have to look at the whole
benefits package, not just wages,'' she said.
   A 25-year United pilot from Washington D.C. said wage cuts
should not go beyond about 10 percent, but added, ``Paywise, we
will do everything we can to save the airline.''

   A moderate earthquake jolted the San
Francisco Bay Area on Friday night, causing minor damage and
jarring nerves during a baseball game that recalled the World
Series contest stopped by last year's kller quake.
   The quake, which struck at 7:39 p.m. PDT, registered 4.5 on the
Richter scale, according to a preliminary reading from the state
Office of Emergency Services. That is considered strong enough to
cause moderate damage in the immediate area.
   One of an afternoon-long series of tremors, it was centered near
Danville, about 20 miles southeast of San Francisco and inland from
San Francisco Bay.
   At Candlestick Park, where an exhibition ballgame between the
San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics had just gotten
underway, players and spectators seemed to momentarily stunned.
   ``Everybody sort of sat up and said, `No, that didn't happen.
Did someone jump hard?''' said Bob Egelko, an Associated Press
reporter who was covering the game. ``It looked like the players
hesitated.''
   The tremors were an eerie reminder of the devastating
7.1-magnitude quake that struck Northern California on Oct. 17,
minutes before the start of the third game of the World Series
between the Giants and the A's at Candlestick. That quake killed 67
people and did millions of dollars in property damage.
   Though the quake was felt over a wide area, there weren't any
immediate reports of serious damage, said Chuck Young of the Office
of Emergency Services.
   ``We queried all of the affected counties and they said the only
real problem has been a slow dial tone on the phone,'' Young said.
   The 4.5-magnitude quake was followed at 7:51 p.m. with a tremor
of magnitude 3.5, Young said.
   Several temblors centered in the Danville area shook San
Francisco and its eastern suburbs through the afternoon, the
biggest of magnitude 3.9 at 3:41 p.m. and of magnitude 3.5 at 1:55
p.m. Those were preliminary measurements by the U.S. Geological
Survey in Menlo Park.
   The afternoon quakes knocked objects from market shelves in
several communities, and startled some shoppers into running from
the stores.
   ``It was like the first one, a sharp, fast jolt and I felt a
real tiny one after,'' said Sue Nicoles, administrative clerk at
Heather Farms Community Center in Walnut Creek said of the largest
temblor.
   ``I jumped right out of my chair, but it didn't last long enough
for me to get under my desk, which would have been my next move,''
she said.
   An apparently unrelated quake of magnitude 4.1 shook a sparsely
populated stretch of desert 450 miles to the southeast, near Indio
at 6:07 p.m. Friday, said scientists at the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena. Authorities said there were no immediate
reports of damage or injuries.
   Tracy Hein of the Contra Costa County Office of Emergency
Services in Danville described the afternoon temblor as ``a little
joy ride, I'll tell you. It was more like a truck hitting the
building.''
   Customers at the Lucky supermarket in Walnut Creek ran out when
cans and boxes tumbled from the shelves, said store manager Gary
Earl. There wasn't any serious damage, he said.
   Bay Area Rapid Transit trains, which connect San Francisco with
the suburbs across the bay, were halted for about five minutes as a
precaution during the afternoon quake, said transit district
spokesman Sy Mouber.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an
earthquake. Every increase of one number means the ground motion is
10 times greater.
   A quake of the magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by
humans, a quake of 3.5 can cause slight damage in the local area, 4
moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7
reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy
damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new Redoubt eruption confirmed the
pattern that geologists have observed in the seismic activity
around the volcano over the past four months.
   Increasing tremors at the volcano's base heralded a moderate
blast Friday from the 10,197-foot volcano about 110 miles southwest
of Anchorage, said geologist Michael Doukas.
   The same earthquake pattern preceded moderate eruptions on March
23 and March 29.
   The latest eruption, at 5:23 p.m. ADT (9:23 p.m. EDT), sent ash
30,000 feet into the sky. It lasted eight minutes, according to a
seismometer on Mount Spur, about 30 miles north of Redoubt.
   Previous eruptions have disrupted flights because the ash can
ruin airplane engines. But the ash from Friday's blast was split by
wind sheer and drifted in two directions, Doukas said.

   Comedian Eddie Murphy is sending a Michigan
couple with 19 children on an all-expense-paid vacation to the
Bahamas _ without the kids.
   ``It's like the honeymoon we never had,'' Diane Veasey, 35, said
Friday. ``But I never dreamed of one like this.''
   Murphy learned of the couple through an article in Jet magazine,
said his publicist, Terrie Williams.
   Mrs. Veasey and her husband, Earl, the pastor of Hickory Grove
Baptist Church in Flint, have been married 20 years and have 19
children from age 7 months through 20 years.
   ``Everybody asks if we planned to have a lot of kids way back in
the beginning and I tell them no, we were just blessed,'' Mrs.
Veasey said.
   The article said Veasey hoped one day to treat his wife to an
exotic vacation.
   Murphy ``contacted the family and offered them first-class
tickets to Nassau, the Bahamas, hotel, food and spending money,''
Williams said. ``His only stipulation is is if they conceive
another child, they have to name it Eddie or some variation
thereof.''

   Actor Anthony Quinn says the owner of a Honolulu
art gallery was the driving force behind his successful career as a
painter.
   Quinn's videotaped testimony was played to jurors earlier this
week on behalf of Center Art Gallery, which is accused of 79 counts
of mail and wire fraud. The charges stem mainly from sales of art
attributed to Salvador Dali. Two of the counts relate to art
created by Quinn and comic Red Skelton.
   The indictment accuses Center Art of telling customers that
Quinn supervised the production of his serigraphs.
   Quinn, 74, testified that he corrected preliminary prints in the
production process but said he did not visit the California
printing shop where they were made.
   Quinn said the limited-edition reproductions of his paintings
sold by the gallery were made by him. He said he has been averaging
about $400,000 a year from his art and credited gallery owner
William Mett with helping him.

   Grammy-winning singer k.d. Lang knows
her androgynous appearance doesn't fit the usual mold of country
music stars.
   In an interview for broadcast today on cable television, Lang
says her appearance and manner ``became unprecedented for a woman
in country to look and act.''
   ``Their role is specifically set out,'' she said.
``Unfortunately everyone in country music today pretty much abides
by those rules. And if they don't, they don't get played on the
radio and they don't get (Country Music Association) nominations.''
   Lang, who won a Grammy award in February, said she still admires
country star Dolly Parton, whose appareance to some is the essence
of femininity.
   ``To me, Dolly Parton is fine .. She created this thing and
she's doing it,'' Lang said.
   Among Lang's hits are ``Crying,'' a duet with the late Roy
Orbison, and ``Luck in my Eye.''

   Aging Hall of Famer James ``Cool Papa'' Bell is
missing baseball memorabilia worth an estimated $252,000, and
police believe it might have been lost in a scam.
   Capt. Jack Titone said two men made several trips to Bell's home
on Cool Papa Bell Avenue last month and through a combination of
slick talk and intimidation, made off with uniforms, gloves, balls,
bats, photos and other items.
   ``They took what they wanted,'' Titone said.
   Bell, 86, takes heart medication and is blind in one eye due to
glaucoma. He said he was not up to resisting.
   ``He's a very sick man,'' said Bell's wife, Clarabelle, 81.
   Bell played 27 seasons in the Negro Leagues in the 1920s, 1930s
and 1940s. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1974.

   You don't have to celebrate Passover to love
``My First Jewish Cooking Video,'' says Mother Wonderful, creator
of the cooking instructions blended with nostalgia, tradition and
commentary.
   ``And what gives any family more pleasure than sitting down
together to share a delicious Sabbath dinner?'' says Mother
Wonderful _ whose real name is Myra Chanin _ as she introduces the
75-minute procession of cooks with their favorite secret recipes.
   And as the old ads for rye bread said, you don't have to be
Jewish to enjoy it.
   ``The video gives non-Jewish people a feeling of that connection
between food and love. This is the food and the tradition that
produced a generation of doctors, lawyers and CPAs,'' Mrs. Chanin
said.
   Actually, the video came out months ago, but Mrs. Chanin held
off publicizing it too much at first.
   ``I wanted to make sure Jewish people liked it,'' she said. ``I
didn't want them all hating the video when I went out promoting it.
Those little old ladies, they're worse than muggers!''
   Every recipe is kosher for Passover, except the challah, a
braided, leavened bread.
   The video offers recipes for gefilte fish, horseradish, chicken
soup, matzoh balls, latke, baked chicken and vegetable kugel. For
dessert there are tasty meringue and raspberry sorbet.
   The video crew took no chances about making a slip that would
violate Jewish dietary laws, Mrs. Chanin said.
   ``We had a kosher maven there for all the taping,'' she said.
``Anyone kosher who wants to use it, they can.''
   Mrs. Chanin thinks the traditional meals are making a comeback.
   ``The reason people are very taken with the old foods is they
really miss the sense of community that existed with them. There
was tremendous feeling in those dinners _ love, competition, all
those things.''
   Mrs. Chanin, who's quick with one-liners, said she didn't really
learn to cook until she left home and decided good cooking was part
of the way to win a husband.
   ``We all say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach,
because we know it's not through his brains,'' she said. ``Yes, the
way to a man's heart is through his stomach, or somewhere around
there.''
   Her own mother did wonderful things with food, Mrs. Chanin said.
   ``I still find that the dishes I cook today that really knock
people out are her recipes,'' she said.
   Mrs. Chanin immortalized her mother with a lighthearted book:
``Jewish Penicillin or Mother Wonderful's Profusely Illustrated
Guide to the Proper Preparation of Chicken Soup.''
   It shows her mother matching wits with a butcher, persuading him
to give her some extra feet for her soup pot to help the flavor;
cleaning and re-rinsing everything.
   ``My mother always wanted me to write something like `War and
Peace,''' Mrs. Chanin said. `I'm sure she never expected to be
immortalized by a book that showed her holding a dead chicken by
its feet.''

<HEAD>Three of Four Crow Tribal Leaders Convicted of Conspiracy and Bank
Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three leaders of the Crow Indian tribe
were convicted of fraudulently convincing two banks to approve
loans that one of the leaders has not repaid. A fourth defendant
was acquitted.
   A U.S. District Court jury Friday convicted tribal Chairman
Richard Real Bird, Theodore Hogan and Willie Stewart Jr. on charges
of conspiracy, bank fraud and lying on a loan application. Robert
S. Howe was acquitted of the same charges.
   U.S. District Judge David Ezra let the three tribal leaders
remain free on bond until sentencing July 17. Each faces up to 12
years in prison and fines up to $25,000.
   The charges were part of a grand jury indictment that named 26
tribal leaders on a total of 37 counts. Thirteen more trials _
about half of which probably will include Real Bird _ are scheduled
throughout the summer.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl Rostad had charged that the
defendants misled the Little Horn State Bank in Hardin and First
Citizens Bank in Billings into approving loans in 1986 for Hogan,
who was deeply in debt.
   Rostad said the defendants told the banks the tribe would pay
Hogan $296,500 for land they knew already had been foreclosed on.
   The banks have not been paid, Rostad said, and Hogan's land,
which is near the Custer Battlefield National Monument in
southeastern Montana, eventually was sold to a non-tribal member.
   Real Bird testified that the Bureau of Indian Affiars is holding
$38 million in coal taxes for the tribe. He said the defendants,
acting on the approval of a BIA employee, believed that money would
be available to pay Hogan, who then could repay the loans.
   ``We've said the defendants' wrongs were not affected by
whatever the BIA did or didn't do,'' Rostad said. ``Apparently, the
jury thought so as well.''
   But Real Bird's lawyer, Rodney Shepherd, said, ``This as much of
a travesty as when the white man took everything from these people
except their pride.
   ``Now, I guess they're trying to take that, too.''

<HEAD>IRS Chief Says Agency Committed to Taxpayer Rights; Some Skeptical</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. says the
Internal Revenue Service is firmly committed to safeguarding
taxpayers' rights, but critics say the word has not filtered down
to some agents in the field.
   David Keating, executive vice president of the National
Taxpayers Union, told a Senate Finance subcommittee Friday that the
situation could get worse as budget shortages increase pressure on
the IRS to boost collections.
   ``As marching orders filter through the bureaucracy, each
management layer tends to rewrite the orders stronger, to ensure
that the field troops fully understand the new mission,'' Keating
said.
   ``The result may well be that IRS employees could take a much
tougher stand with taxpayers, causing more violations of the
Taxpayer Bill of Rights.''
   Goldberg, testifying at a hearing on how the taxpayer protection
law is being implemented, acknowledged that his agency's 120,000
employees make mistakes. But overall, he said, the new law is
working; ``We are indeed making a great deal of progress.''
   ``Whether a taxpayer is due a refund, owes the government taxes,
is being audited, or is asking us a question, that individual
deserves to be treated fairly and with respect,'' Goldberg said.
``That is the fundamental right taxpayers should expect and they
should receive nothing less.''
   The Taxpayer Bill of Rights was enacted in 1988 in response to
complaints about the behavior of some IRS employees and what
Congress viewed as a tendency to intimidate citizens.
   The law, for example, requires the IRS to spell out clearly any
demand for taxes due; prohibits the agency from rewarding employees
on the basis of how much tax they collect, and makes it more
difficult for the IRS to seize a person's property for nonpayment
of taxes.
   Kay M. Council of High Point, N.C., told the subcommittee that
after a long battle with the IRS, her husband killed himself so she
could use his $250,000 insurance policy to continue the fight.
``Alex is dead because of the IRS's arrogance and incompetence,''
she contended.
   The Councils' problem grew out of a $70,000 tax-shelter
deduction they claimed on their 1979 tax return and which the IRS
rejected. After Alex Council's death in 1988, a federal court ruled
that the couple owed no back taxes because the IRS's notice of
deficiency had been sent four months after the statute of
limitations had expired.
   Keating, of the National Taxpayers Union, said it is unlikely
that the Bill of Rights would have helped the Councils. Although
the legislation allows a taxpayer to sue for damages if the IRS
acts recklessly or intentionally breaks a law, it does not permit a
suit for careless actions.
   ``Was the IRS treatment of the Council family careless and
negligent? Absolutely,'' Keating said. ``Was it reckless or
intentional? It might have been, but that is a very difficult
standard to prove.''
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the new law ``appears to have
had a major positive impact on the relationship between taxpayers
and the IRS.''
   ``While we get plenty of telephone calls complaining about
compliance burdens, complexity and substantive tax provisions,
telephone calls from chamber small-business members facing
immediate and unwarranted levy on (seizing) their house or business
or similar serious problems have declined noticeably,'' said David
R. Burton, manager of the chamber's tax policy center.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of the subcommittee and chief
author of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, said the recent complaint of
an Arkansas businessman probably sums up how most Americans view
the IRS.
   ``It's not that I have a problem with paying the IRS every shiny
nickel I owe the government, and it's not that I begrudge them
getting tough with me if I don't pay,'' the businessman said.
``What I resent is when they bury me in computer letters, don't
even acknowledge my explanations, then grab my bank account and
ruin my credit, and only then decide they were wrong after all.''
   IRS Commissioner Goldberg said much the same thing: ``We need as
an agency to learn to ... stand in the other guy's shoes.''

<HEAD>President to Sign Executive Order Protecting Chinese Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says he will sign an executive
order that he earlier promised _ and in fact claimed to have issued
_ protecting Chinese students from deportation.
   Aides said Bush will release the order, probably early next
week, incorporating provisions of an informal directive he had
issued on dealing with Chinese who feared for their safety if sent
home when their visas expired. Many had supported the
now-suppressed democracy movement.
   The president said his order also will ``extend the deferral of
enforced departure for Chinese nationals, which is currently
scheduled to expire on June 5 of this year, through Jan. 1, 1994.''
   Reacting to criticism that he has failed to issue the executive
order he promised last year, Bush said Friday: ``I did say I was
going to have an executive order. What we had was an executive
directive from the president'' that had ``precisely the same legal
effect as an executive order.''
   The president had promised the executive order when he vetoed
congressional legislation Nov. 30 that was designed to protect the
students from deportation.
   He viewed the legislation as an infringement on presidential
powers, but pledged at the time that, in the face of harsh
reprisals by the Beijing government against democracy advocates, no
Chinese student would be forced to go home against his or her will.
   The president has since said that he issued an executive order.
   But instead it was a directive, and ``to allay any concerns''
Bush said Friday he will now put it in the form of an executive
order.
   ``We don't want to take a chance on people being mistreated,
brutalized,'' he said in a question-and-answer session to the
American Society of Newspaper Editors that also focused on his
upcoming summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   On another topic, Bush said he will soon announce a policy
banning offshore oil drilling in some environmentally sensitive
areas and redefining sea lanes for tankers in others, such as the
Florida Everglades.
   The president last year ordered a task force to study offshore
drilling, with an eye to environmental protection. He has yet to
announce the findings of the study or any policy moves.
   Bush, a former Texas oilman, said he opposes a permanent ban on
offshore drilling ``because then I would be compelled to ask the
question where do we get the energy to keep this country going. I
don't think there should be a ban.''
   However, he added, ``there will definitely be bans on certain
environmentally sensitive areas.''
   Touching on other matters, Bush said:
   _He ``knew nothing about'' the meeting between former President
Carter and Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat
this week. He said Carter was ``not acting with the blessing of,
nor disapproval of, or anything else of the administration,'' but
``certainly a former president should be free to do his thing.''
   _He is not linking aid to Israel to U.S. hopes that Israel works
out a negotiating format for peace with Palestinians.
   _He hoped a compromise budget plan could be drafted to reduce
the huge federal deficit, but he noted that one congressional
deadline had already been missed and another was fast approaching.

<HEAD>Afghan Mujahedeen Turn Surrender Ceremony into Pitched Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ceremony for the surrender of
10,000 Afghan guerrillas turned into a surprise attack in which
rebels shot to death at least two Afghan generals, according to
news reports and sources.
   Rebel sources said Friday's attack near the western Afghan city
of Herat was planned five months ago. It apparently was in revenge
for a similar deadly trick by government forces 11 years ago.
   The exact number of casualties was not known.
   Western diplomats in Pakistan said on condition of anonymity
they had reports that up to five Afghan generals were killed or
wounded in the 15-minute gun battle and in hand-to-hand combat with
knives and pistols. They also said civilians, including children,
died in the fighting on the plains outside Herat, about 400 miles
west of the Afghan capital of Kabul.
   Government-run Radio Kabul said ``numerous'' people were killed,
including Lt. Gen. Jalal Razaminda, a second unidentified general,
civilians and nine guerrillas.
   The guerrillas had said they would give up their weapons and
support the national reconcilation policy of Soviet-backed
President Najib.
   The government uses the term ``national reconcilation'' to
signify agreement by local guerrilla groups to switch sides and
either stop fighting or help the Marxist government in the war it
has fought with rebels since seizing power in a 1978 coup.
   The government says tens of thousands of rebels have laid down
their weapons in the past year.
   But this time, said the Jamait-i-Islami guerrilla organization,
it was all a trick to trap government forces.
   Jamiat-i-islami is considered the most militarily efficient of
the seven Afghan guerrilla groups and the dominant one in the Herat
area.
   The rebels are supported by the United States and Saudi Arabia
and operate from bases in Pakistan. They call themselves
mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors.
   Rebel sources in the southeastern Pakistani town of Quetta, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said rebels slowly began
infiltrating the Herat area in November and recently notified the
government that they wanted to give up the fight.
   According to Radio Kabul, 2,200 armed guerrillas and 8,000
unarmed rebels gathered on the plains about 25 miles from Herat for
the surrender ceremony.
   But the guerrillas _ with weapons ranging from side arms to
recoilless cannons, missiles and rocket launchers _ fired at
government officials and soldiers instead of laying down their arms.
   Western diplomats and rebel laders said the guerrillas fired the
first shot when the provincial governor, Fazle Haq Khaliq Yaar,
embraced an unidentified guerrilla commander dressed in a white
robe and turban.
   They said the governor's guards immediately returned fire and
the ceremony became a pitched battle, with huge exchanges of
gunfire.
   The diplomats said several civilians, including children, were
killed in the cross-fire, which stopped when two Afghan army tanks
moved in with bursts of fire.
   Kabul radio's version of the fighting was: ``A small group of
extremists attacked the welcoming ceremony with heavy fire. In the
resulting battle between Afghan troops and extremists, numerous
people were martyred.''
   An Afghan national TV photographer was reported shot in the head
and badly wounded.
   Herat was the first region in Afghanistan to rise against the
Soviet Union in early 1979 before the Red Army stepped in to
bolster the Marxist government.
   At least 2,000 Afghans were reported to have died when
government forces pretended to join the insurrection against
growing Soviet influence and killed protesters.
   The Soviet Union withdrew its troops in February 1989 but still
sends huge quantities of supplies and weapons to the Kabul
government.

<HEAD>Bush Lauds Accord, But Says Implementation Will be True Test</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush is praising Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu for exhibiting political courage in
championing a major trade agreement, but warning that the true test
will come in implementation of the pact.
   Bush lauded Kaifu for the success he achieved in the month since
the two leaders met in California to discuss trade tensions arising
from this country's huge $49 billion deficit with Japan.
   ``For the first time, Japan has committed to removing a broad
array of structural barriers that constrain trade and impede
imports,'' Bush said in an appearance Friday before the American
Society of Newspaper Editors.
   But he said actual results would be what counted.
   ``Neither the Japanese consumer nor the American people will be
convinced that progress is at hand until they see concrete
results,'' Bush said.
   After four days of marathon negotiations, the United States and
Japan reached agreement late Thursday on a set of proposals aimed
at correcting broad-based structural barriers to trade in both
countries.
   Japan promised to take a series of steps to make it easier for
Americans and other foreigners to do business in Japan. U.S.
negotiators pledged to boost America's ability to compete
internationally by improving the education system, increasing
savings and reducing the federal budget deficit.
   But U.S. trade specialists expressed doubts Friday over how far
the Japanese will go in implementing the accord, especially in
light of strong political resistance to some of the measures in
Tokyo.
   A major Japanese retailers' group vowed to fight a key provision
of the pact designed to relax restrictions on establishment of
large retail stores in the country.
   Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., who was a top trade negotiator in the
Reagan administration, said the latest agreement bore many
similarities to other accords dating back to 1984 and earlier that
had failed to open Japan's markets.
   ``These talks are always presented as a final solution to the
problem,'' he said. ``We keep claiming victory, victory and nothing
much happens.''
   In a sign that Kaifu faces major political obstacles in
implementing the agreement, Japan's Federation of Specialty Stores
Associations charged that a key provision relaxing restrictions on
opening large stores would hurt small shop owners.
   The 50,000-member association of small retailers vowed to ``do
our best to prevent the decisions from being enforced.''
   U.S. negotiators viewed shortening of the time for opening large
stores as a major victory because it would open the way for large
American and other foreign retailers to set up operations. One of
the beneficiaries is expected to be the Toys ``R'' Us chain.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said she believed the
pessimists predicting failure for the new trade accord would be
proven wrong because of a new climate of public opinion in Japan.
She cited polls that found Japanese consumers upset by high prices
and lack of competition.
   Mrs. Hills said the administration intends to keep lobbying for
results as negotiators work to prepare a final report on structural
trade barriers that is due in July.
   Even after that time, she said, the administration will keep
monitoring progress to make sure that the commitments made by Japan
are being met.
   ``This is a good first step. It constitutes a clear blueprint of
reform that will facilitate market opening,'' Mrs. Hills said at a
news briefing. ``Obviously, we want results and if they don't
occur, we would be disappointed.''
   She refused to speculate about whether the administration will
target Japan as an unfair trader in a second round of negotiations.
The administration must decide on that issue by April 30.
   Many in Congress viewed the increased willingness of Japan to
negotiate agreements as an attempt to escape being targeted again,
but Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., urged Bush in a letter to once again
target Japan in order to keep up the pressure.
   ``I believe strongly that a failure to designate Japan will
seriously jeopardize the credibility of U.S. trade policy,''
Danforth wrote.

<HEAD>`Phantom Head' Headed Back into Space</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's known by NASA as the ``Phantom
Head,'' a human skull filled with sensors to measure the dose of
space radiation that astronauts receive.
   The skull goes into space aboard the shuttle Discovery for the
third and probably last time Tuesday. Its keeper in orbit,
astronaut Kathryn Sullivan, hopes the trip will put an end to all
jokes about the ``phantom passenger.''
   ``It's not a passenger. It's a device, actually a very
sophisticated one and one that has considerable potential to
provide some very significant data to all of the people within NASA
who are trying to measure crew health,'' she said.
   The head is crammed with instruments that bring its weight to
more than 20 pounds, and covered with a black plastic material
simulating human skin. It contains as many as 600 tiny measuring
devices called dosimeters.
   As in the two previous missions, the skull will be mounted to a
wall in the shuttle middeck near the lower end of an astronaut
sleeping bag. It will be kept in a fire-retardant bag.
   ``It's not like it's hooked there staring at people,'' said NASA
spokesman Brian Welch.
   The skull will help scientists determine how much radiation
penetrates the astronauts heads when they are in space. Such data
may be crucial for planning extended space station missions and
lengthy stays on the moon and Mars.
   ``It would be medically irresponsible to commit crews to some of
the high-flown ideas we have without understanding their safety,''
Sullivan said. The skull is one of 11 devices inside Discovery that
will monitor various kinds of radiation in space.
   Although the radiation-monitoring devices do not rival the
sophisticiation of Discovery's primary payload, the $1.5 billion
Hubble Space Telescope, they are equally important to the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, said Gautam Badhwar, the
Johnson Space Center physicist in charge of the experiment.
   ``Hubble has a very fundamental importance in terms of astronomy
and how we understand the solar system and the universe around us,
whereas the radiation experiments are much more local,'' he said.
``They are designed for the safety of the astronauts for both today
and for future flights.''
   The skull first went into space on a Defense Department flight
in August, but its existence was not acknowleged until after a
second secret military mission, that of the Atlantis, ended March 4.
   The space agency plans to send an entire human torso into space
but not until the current data is analyzed further, Badhwar said.
   Data collected from the Atlantis mission still is being studied,
Badhwar said. But results from the skull's first venture into space
indicate there is twice as much neutron radiation in an orbiting
shuttle than NASA had expected at high energy levels.
   The extra radiation poses no danger to astronauts, Badhwar said.
   Welch said NASA decided to send the skull, or DSO469 as it's
formally known, on Discovery's five-day flight because the shuttle
will ascend to 380 miles, the highest a shuttle has ever gone.

<HEAD>Arms Control Accords Remain Elusive After Shevardnadze Visit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union head
for a superpower summit in seven weeks still divided on major
nuclear arms control issues but hoping that more talks next month
will produce the ``hard decisions'' needed to weld agreement.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III did use three days of
meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze this
week to deliver repeated warnings of the consequences of employing
Moscow's military weight to crush Lithuania's fervor for
independence.
   And both nations took a new look at how a unified Germany will
fit into the European community, making no effort to disguise
fundamental differences on how that fit eventually will be made.
   Baker and Shevardnadze acted to lower expectations that
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev actually
will be able to sign a treaty sharply reducing intercontinental
nuclear weapons when they meet here beginning May 30.
   But the two did hold out hope that all or most major issues may
be resolved by then, leaving the actual signing of a treaty to
await a celebration summit later in the year.
   Baker, speaking to reporters before a backdrop of 14 American
and Soviet flags, said he and Shevardnadze failed to resolve
differences over air-launched and sea-launched cruise missiles, two
obstacles for agreement on a Strategic Arms Reduction treaty.
   ``That is a disappointment,'' he said.
   Shevardnadze, holding a separate news conference in the same
State Department auditorium, said: ``I would not hide from you the
fact that ... we have encountered certain difficulties, certain
problems'' in concluding a strategic arms treaty.
   ``This is a time of hard choices, the hard choices that one has
to make in the concluding stages of the talks,'' the foreign
minister said.
   He said the problem is compounded by the need to write a treaty
that will be ratified by the newly independent Soviet parliament
acting in much the same way as the U.S. Senate considers
international accords.
   But Shevardnadze predicted: ``In the end there will be real
certainty that we will have a solid agreement, a durable
agreement.''
   Baker and Shevardnadze will hold another round of talks in the
Soviet Union on May 16-19 to try to settle the nuclear-weapons
issues.
   ``It's still our hope that major issues will be resolved by the
summit, but that's got to take a lot of work,'' Baker said.
   He also said divisions remain on key elements of an agreement to
reduce conventional, non-nuclear military forces in Europe,
especially on how to deal with aircraft.
   Bush met with Shevardnadze for about two hours and joined Baker
in warning that crushing the independence drive in Lithuania would
chill superpower relations.
   ``I don't think we are telling them what to do; we're telling
them what not to do _ and that is, don't use force,'' the president
told the American Society of Newspaper Editors later.
   Baker said he raised the issue of Lithuania with Shevardnadze on
each of the three days, delivering ``very serious and candid''
warnings.
   But he said there does seem to be hope for a peaceful resolution
in Shevardnadze's repeated commitment to peaceful dialogue and both
sides' apparent interest in some sort of referendum on the issue.
   Baker also said the furor may be dampened by the decision of
Lithuanian leaders to draw back from a headlong rush to
independence by indicating that a more gradual step-by-step process
might be acceptable.
   Shevardnadze said, ``We have a clear conscience'' on Lithuania
and that he does not believe the controversy should damage
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Baker said Moscow had dropped its insistence that a reunified
Germany be neutral, recognizing that ``is perhaps not the best
route to go.''
   But both he and Shevardnadze made clear that sharp disagreement
remains over U.S. insistence that a unified German nation retain
West Germany's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``We have to look for a solution, a solution that would be
acceptable'' to both NATO and the Warsaw Pact, Shevardnadze said.
   He did not offer any specifics, beyond a suggestion that perhaps
the merged country could be part both of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   Baker displayed no enthusiasm for the idea.

<HEAD>Many States Experiencing Budget Crunch, Survey Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States are getting poorer, forcing governors
to respond with budget cuts, a freeze on new programs and calls for
higher taxes, a survey says.
   Twenty states have either proposed or already cut spending in
budgets previously enacted, compared with eight this time a year
ago, the study by two associations said Friday.
   The report blamed worsening state finances on increased spending
for Medicaid, education, prisons and transportation _ problems it
traced in part to federal requirements or spending cutbacks.
   The fiscal survey of the states is taken twice yearly by the
National Governors' Association and the National Association of
State Budget Officers.
   The financial outlook for states has become so bleak, the report
said, that governors are even willing to propose taxes in an
election year.
   ``Large tax proposals are not commonly enacted in years
corresponding with gubernatorial elections,'' the report said.
``Fiscal 1991 is such a year. Thirty-six governors' races will be
decided in November 1990.''
   While 21 governors have proposed tax increases, New Jersey and
New York would account for more than 50 percent of the $4.9 billion
raised if the new revenues were enacted, the survey found.
   Most governors have proposed 1991 spending increases of 5
percent to 10 percent, the report said.
   ``This range of increases suggests that states will be
continuing current programs, but not adding new initiatives,'' said
Gerald H. Miller, executive director of the National Association of
State Budget Officers.
   Total state year-end balances, which registered a record high of
$12.6 billion last year, are projected to drop to $8.3 billion by
the end of 1990, the survey found.
   The study said the ``most significant personal income tax
proposals'' were made in Kentucky, New York and Oklahoma.
   Eight states have proposed sales tax increases, with New Jersey
seeking to raise more than $1 billion by boosting the rate from 6
percent to 7 percent, and by removing some exemptions. Rate boosts
also are under consideration in New Mexico and Oklahoma.
   Five states have asked for business tax increases, with the
largest hike proposed in New York.
   Nine states want cigarette tax increases, led by Florida's plan
to raise $259 million in new revenue.
   Four states want higher motor fuel taxes, with Ohio and
Washington proposing the largest increases. Four states seek to
increase taxes on alcohol.

<HEAD>Eastern Airlines Gets OK to Sell Foreign Routes to American</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines has government permission to
sell its key international routes to American Airlines under a plan
that Eastern officials say is key to the future of the troubled
carrier.
   The Transportation Department on Friday tentatively approved the
transfer of Eastern's South and Central American routes, along with
a Miami-Madrid route, to American. It also approved sale of a
Continental Airlines Miami-London route to American as part of the
same package.
   Eastern and Continental both are owned by Texas Air Corp.
   But the department stalled a proposal to turn over Eastern's
only remaining Canadian route, from Miami and Tampa, Fla., to
Toronto. It said further study would determine whether that could
go to American or another carrier.
   The $349 million sale is central to Eastern's plans to rebuild
under the direction of a bankruptcy court from the effects of a
year-old Machinists union strike. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.
Lifland last month approved the proposed sale of Eastern's Latin
American routes and related assets.
   The Transportation Department approval is temporary, and would
not become final until after a 10-day period to allow for
objections to the deal and responses from the airlines.
   While the government awards routes to carriers on the basis of
public interest and must approve all transfers of service, it
allows the airlines to treat their routes as assets that can be
bought and sold.
   In approving the joint application by Eastern, Continental and
American, the department said the transfer was in the public
interest and did not conflict with ``important international
aviation policy objectives.''
   It noted that the carriers maintained that the transfer of the
routes was essential to the viability of Eastern and that
American's acquisition would continue the service.
   The order also said the government determined that the transfer
would not reduce competition and ``indeed will, in many respects,
improve it.''

<HEAD>Court Allows Documentary on Custody Case to Air</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cable telecast of a documentary about an
international child custody battle went on as scheduled, only
minutes after a federal appeals court overturned a ban on the
broadcast.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals on Friday night
vacated an order that Dr. Eric Foretich had obtained hours earlier
in U.S. District Court barring broadcast of ``Hilary in Hiding,'' a
British Broadcasting Corp. documentary about his 7-year-old
daughter, Hilary.
   The program was aired Friday night on the Lifetime cable
network, whose executives had appealed the ruling of District Judge
Stanley Sporkin.
   The documentary chronicled the girl's odyssey with her maternal
grandparents that took her from northern Virginia to England to New
Zealand during her father's attempts to have unsupervised visits
with her.
   Foretich's lawyer, Elaine Mittleman, argued that the program
contained a segment that included footage of the girl during
therapy sessions. She said that showing the scenes would have
violated the child's constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy.
   The girl's mother, Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, sent the child into
hiding
   after a District of Columbia Superior Court judge ordered her to
allow Foretich unsupervised visits with the girl.
   Morgan claimed that her former husband had sexually assaulted
the child, a charge that Foretich denies. Morgan spent almost two
years in jail for contempt.

<HEAD>Federal Agency Investigates Greyhound Shootings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
says it is investigating the two dozen shootings that have occurred
in the five-week-old Greyhound strike.
   ``We believe the public safety is at stake in the random
shootings directed toward passenger-occupied Greyhound buses. The
potential for disaster is considerable,'' Stephen Higgins, the
bureau's director, said Friday.
   The agency also will conduct an arson investigation into a fire
at a Greyhound garage in Boston Wednesday night that caused
$250,000 in damage, Higgins said.
   The agency ``has no involvement nor interest in the strike,'' he
said.
   Special agents in each of the bureau's 22 district offices will
serve as ``coordinators'' with the bus company on the
investigations. In a statement, Higgins urged anyone with
information to call the company's hotline for reporting suspects.
   Nick Nichols, a spokesman for the Amalgamated Council of
Greyhound Local Unions, said the union welcomed the government's
involvement.
   Richard Cook, head of the bureau's firearms division, said
agents had been working with Greyhound officials on the shootings
but had not gotten involved at the company's request.
   ``We're investigating it because it's a violation of the gun
control act. We would be investigating it if there weren't a strike
and independent of anything Greyhound asked for,'' Cook said.
   FBI agents are involved only on a limited basis in some cases,
said spokesman Mike Kortan.
   Also Friday, union president Jim La Sala wrote Greyhound's board
of directors, asking board members to pressure company officials to
resume negotiations.
   About 6,300 Greyhound drivers and 3,000 maintenance and other
workers walked out March 2 over wages and job security.
   Talks between Greyhound Lines Inc. and the union have been
stalled since March 18, and the company said it won't return to the
bargaining table until a week goes by without any acts of violence.
   There have been nearly 30 shootings and more than 100 bomb
threats, the company said. The union contends there have been more
than 60 incidents of violence against striking workers. One striker
was crushed to death by a bus in Redding, Calif., on March 2.
   Greyhound, the nation's only nationwide bus system, has been
operating on a reduced schedule with replacement drivers and union
members who crossed the picket line.

<HEAD>Air Force Lagged in Notifying Cheney of Off-Target Bomb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force waited months before notifying
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney that one of two F-117A Stealth jet
fighter-bombers used in the Panama invasion dropped a bomb ``way
off target,'' his spokesman says.
   Meanwhile, Cheney repeatedly touted the ``pinpoint accuracy'' of
the futuristic F-117A planes despite the incident during the Dec.
20 attack.
   Cheney's spokesman, Pete Williams, also was kept ignorant of the
error until after he disclosed new information about the
long-classified aircraft at a Pentagon press briefing Tuesday.
   In the days following the U.S. invasion, Pentagon officials said
the high-tech planes were used for the first time in combat _
dropping 2,000-pound bombs near a Panamanian Defense Forces
barracks in order to stun and confuse the troops as U.S.
paratroopers landed in a nearby airfield.
   But Williams confirmed Friday that one of the planes actually
dropped its bomb some distance away, due to an apparent pilot error.
   ``The pilots were told to drop their bombs no closer than 50
meters'' from two separate PDF barracks buildings, Williams said.
But due to a last-minute misunderstanding between the pilots, the
second F-117A dropped its bomb on a hillside some distance away,
Williams said.
   ``The first bomb hit 55 meters from one of the barracks, but the
second bomb was way off target,'' Williams said.
   Williams also acknowledged that despite weeks of preparation for
his F-117A briefing on Tuesday _ in which he disclosed
long-classified details about the radar-evading fighter-bomber _
``I didn't know'' about the bombing mistake.
   ``It was news to us,'' Williams said on Friday about the
disclosure in The New York Times and the trade publication
Aerospace Daily, that one of the F-117As had missed its intended
target by over 300 yards.
   Williams said neither he, nor Cheney, knew about the pilot's
error until after they were questioned about an off-target bomb
crater by New York Times correspondent Michael Gordon, who had a
photograph of it.
   Asked when the Air Force informed him and Cheney, Williams said
they were not told about the mistake until Tuesday afternoon, after
the F-117A briefing took place.
   ``We all know now. We all found out about the same time,'' he
said.
   Air Force spokeswoman Capt. Susan Strednansky explained the
lapse by saying that there was ``apparently some confusion
regarding the exact impact of the bomb coming up the chain of
command.''
   She said Air Force officials were looking into the matter to try
to explain the confusion. She said there was no attempt by Air
Force military or civilian leaders to keep anything from Cheney.
   Williams said it now appears that the problem centered on a
misunderstanding between the lead pilot in the two-aircraft bombing
formation and the second pilot, known as the wingman.
   As the planes closed in the on barracks, the lead pilot was
supposed to drop a bomb on a field near a barracks on the left,
while the wingman was supposed to drop a bomb on a field near a
barracks located to the right of it. Because of a change in wind
direction, however, the lead pilot told his wingman to exchange
targets with him, Williams said.
   However, the lead pilot didn't do as he said he would, and for
some unexplained reason dropped his bomb on his original target.
The wingman then adjusted his target even further to the left,
believing that the lead pilot had followed the changed plans.
   But that meant the wingman hit a hillside some distance away
instead of his original target, located to the right of the target
hit by the lead pilot, Williams said.

<HEAD>Exxon Says Tests Show Fisheries Not Threatened by Oil Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ENDERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last year's Exxon Valdez oil spill is
unlikely to cause long-term harm to fish and other organisms in
Prince William Sound, Exxon Corp. said in a report.
   Toxins from the nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled
in March 1989 were in proportions low enough not to threaten fish,
plankton and sea mammals, according to the report Friday.
   ``The tainting problem is just not there. It's good news to the
fishermen,'' Jerry M. Neff of Battelle, the Ohio-based company that
conducted the study commissioned by Exxon.
   State officials said they were skeptical.
   ``It's an example of taking a part of the environment and saying
`Well, this little part is clean and therefore doesn't it follow
there isn't any damage and there shouldn't be any concern?''' said
Joe Ferguson, a spokesman for the Departmant of Environmental
Conservation.
   The Exxon Valdez oil tanker went aground on Bligh Reef near
Valdez on March 24, 1989. In the months following the disaster, oil
coated hundreds of miles of shoreline and killed countless birds,
otters and other sea mammals.
   The study involved 2,300 water samples taken from locations
throughout Prince William Sound, starting one week after the spill
and extending through October, according to the report accompanying
it.
   Samples mostly came from shallow areas of the water column _ the
portion of water between the ocean bottom and 3 to 9 feet below the
water's surface, Neff said.
   Scientists found that the level of toxins from the crude oil _
including benzene and xylene _ fell rapidly in the weeks and months
after the spill and were not sufficient to affect fish, plants or
animals.
   The report did not attempt to assess contamination or its
effects at the ocean bottom or at the surface.
   ``We are encouraged by the results of this report and hope that
those people most intimately linked with the water quality of
Prince William Sound are equally encouraged,'' said Exxon spokesman
Karsten Rodvik.
   But Ferguson said the report showed Exxon was more interested in
public relations than in sharing data about contamination from the
spill.
   The report was designed ``to diminish and lessen peoples'
perception of what might be wrong,'' he said.
   The report said thin sheens of weathered crude found on the
surface of the water in some spots pose no threat to either fish or
animals below or on the surface.
   But state scientists who have analyzed the effects of the spill
and who had seen the Battelle report said shoreline contamination,
and not the water column, is the real problem, Ferguson said.
   Jack Lamb, vice president of Cordova District Fishermen's
United, said the study would ``ease a lot of the concerns.'' But
the report said pollution was highest last April and May, when the
fry were leaving streams and estuaries and feeding on plankton as
they headed for the open ocean.
   ``We're still going to have concerns about how that affected the
outgoing fry,'' Lamb said.

<HEAD>Intelligence Officials Say Chemical Plant Fire Was A Fake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. authorities now believe a fire at a
Libyan chemical plant was a hoax since satellite photographs show
that burn marks were painted on the building, The Washington Post
reports.
   ``It clearly was an attempt at deception,'' an unidentified
senior intelligence official told the newspaper in a story
published in today's editions. ``It's not particularly well done.''
   The United States accused Libya of producing poison gas at the
plant. The Libyans, who said the plant produced medicine, accused
the United States and other countries of being responsible for
setting it on fire in early March.
   By the end of last month, U.S. officials were saying that the
damage at the plant was not as extensive as previously believed.
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said then that the
possibility of a fake fire could not be ruled out.
   Nevertheless, intelligence officials cited by the Post said they
did not think the plant near Rabta would be returning to production
soon.
   ``They're not going to do anything while the rest of the world
is looking,'' an official told the newspaper. ``It's going to
remain static as long as the heat's on.''

<HEAD>FDA to Issue Aspirin Warnings for Pregnant Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration says new
warnings will be required on over-the-counter aspirin products
advising women in the last three months of pregnancy not to use the
products unless directed by a physician.
   Aspirin late in pregnancy can affect fetal circulation and
uterine contractions and cause excessive bleeding during delivery,
an FDA spokeswoman said Friday.
   A third-trimester pregnancy warning is already required on
non-prescription ibuprofen products.
   Acting FDA Commissioner James Benson detailed the agency's plans
in a March 29 letter to Thomas Warriner, under secretary of the
California Health and Welfare Agency.
   Benson said he was aware of the state's interest in preparing a
similar warning under Proposition 65, California's anti-toxics law,
and wanted officials there to know FDA's plans.
   Benson said the warning would likely be similar to the ibuprofen
warning, which says: ``It is especially important not to use
ibuprofen during the last three months of pregnancy unless
specifically directed to do so by your doctor because it may cause
problems in the unborn child or complications during delivery.''
   The warning would take effect immediately and companies would
have one year to make the label changes, he said.
   Aspirin labels already advise pregnant women and nursing mothers
to get the advice of a health professional before using the product.

<HEAD>Suspended Sentences Ordered in Pentagon Document Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two RCA Corp. employees who pleaded guilty to
obtaining and transporting classified Pentagon budget documents
have been sentenced to two years imprisonment, with all but a few
months suspended.
   U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, Va., handed
down the sentences to Ronald B. Stevens and Leonard C. Kampf on
Friday.
   Stevens and Kampf had pleaded guilty Feb. 5, the same day RCA
Corp. pleaded guilty and paid $2.5 million to cover criminal and
civil liabilities.
   The cases stemmed from an investigation into trafficking in
classified documents by major Defense Department contractors.
   Stevens, a manager of marketing services at RCA's Aerospace and
Defense Division in Cherry Hill, N.J., was sentenced to two years
imprisonment with all but two months suspended, and 100 hours of
community service. He also was placed on one year of supervised
probation and fined $3,000.
   Kampf, who was employed as manager of marketing information and
communications in RCA's Government Systems Division in Cherry Hill
until his retirement in 1984, was sentenced to two years
imprisonment, with all but four months suspended, and 100 hours of
community service. In addition, he was placed on one year of
supervised probation and fined $5,000.

<HEAD>Democrats Formally Filing Complaint Against Stangeland</HEAD>

   Minnesota Democrats are formally asking the
House to investigate allegations that Rep. Arlan Stangeland,
R-Minn., improperly charged Congress for hundreds of phone calls to
and from the home of a woman lobbyist.
   The complaint being filed with the House Committee on Standards
of Official Conduct also accuses Stangeland of exchanging favors
with a former congressman who now works as a lobbyist.
   The allegations were made public in newspaper articles last
January. Stangeland, who is seeking re-election, has denied any
impropriety.
   ``I don't think the questions have been answered,'' Ruth
Stanoch, chairwoman of the Minnesota Democratic Party, said Friday.
``They're still lingering right now.''
   Stangeland has said he welcomed the ethics investigation even
though he believed it was unnecessary.
   Stangeland says that his relationship with Eve Jarvis, who now
works for the House of Representatives, was professional, although
he acknowledged making 341 calls to or from her home during five
months in 1986 and 1987.
   Ms. Jarvis has refused to talk to reporters.

   Here are some facts and figures on Nepal:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Hindus comprise 90 percent of Nepal's 17 million
people; 5 percent are Moslem and 3 percent are Buddhist. Nepalese
law forbids Hindus to convert to Christianity. Foreign Christians
have occasionally been expelled after being accused of
proselytizing, while some Nepalese Christians have been jailed
after being convicted of trying to convert Hindus. King Birendra is
accorded god-like status by many of his subjects, especially in the
impoverished countryside. The literacy rate is 25 percent. Life
expectancy is 52. Eleven percent of all babies die before the age
of one year.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE GOVERNMENT _ Nepal is a monarchy with a legislature, called
the Rashtriya Panchayat, or National Assembly. The king appoints
one-fifth of the assembly's members. The rest are elected on a
nonpartisan basis, but political observers say the king approves
the candidates. Political parties have been outlawed, except for a
brief experiment with Western-style democracy from 1959 to 1961.
King Birendra, 44, who studied at Eton College in England and
Harvard University, ascended to the throne in 1972 upon the death
of his father, King Mahendra.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ The per capita annual income of $150 is among the
lowest in the world. The main foreign exchange earnings come from
tourism, which includes trekking and mountain climbing, and from
export of carpets, an industry dominated by Tibetan refugees.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE GEOGRAPHY _ Nepal ranges from the semitropical Terai plain
in the south to the snow-covered Himalayan Mountains. Its
geographic area of 56,827 square miles is about the size of the
state of Wisconsin. The country is wedged between Asia's two
biggest powers: India to the east, south and west; China to the
north.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Hindu-Buddhist culture was flourishing in the Katmandu
valley by the 4th century A.D. By medieval times, many small
principalities had emerged. One of the most dominant was that of
the Gurkhas, whose soldiers still serve in the armies of India and
Britain and in United Nations peacekeeping forces. Nepal is proud
of never having been colonized, although it was a nominal British
protectorate from 1816 to 1923.
   The present Shaha dynasty dates to the 17th century, although
from 1846 to 1951 real power rested with the Rana family, which
installed a system of hereditary prime ministers whose descendants
are still active. In the early 1950s, Nepal started opening up to
the outside world, emerging from an isolation nurtured by its
rulers and fostered by geography. Initially, India was the major
trading part, but in the past two years Nepal has sought other
commercial ties, especially with China.

   A personality disorder prevented John E.
List from seeing solutions to his problems and like a tightly
stretched rubberband, he snapped _ and massacred his family, a
psychiatrist testified.
   List, a devout Lutheran, was a man ``who was being bombarded
with stresses that he was taught to contain,'' Dr. Sheldon I.
Miller said Friday, the fifth day of List's trial. ``He believed
that in doing what he did, his family was allowed to join God.''
   List has admitted killing his wife, Helen, 46; mother, Alma, 85;
and three children in their Westfield mansion on Nov. 9, 1971. He
was arrested in June in Virginia, where he had been living under a
different name.
   List's defense is that he is innocent by reason of mental
disease or defect.
   List was afflicted with an ``obsessive-compulsive'' disorder
that made him a perfectionist preoccupied with details, excessively
devoted to work inflexible in his morality and unable to express
emotion, Miller testified in List's defense.
   He grew up ``emotionally impoverished,'' virtually friendless
and imbued with religion under an authoritarian father who taught
that anything less than complete self-sufficiency was ``not manly
and inappropriate,'' Miller said.
   But List saw he could no longer support his family and could
arrive at only two options: welfare, which was impossible because
of his background, and killing his family.
   If the jury finds that because of List's mental state he did not
act premeditatively, willfully deliberately or with malice, List
could be convicted of second-degree murder or manslaughter rather
than first degree murder, with which he is charged.
   Earlier Friday, the jury heard evidence that Helen List suffered
an advanced case of syphilis she had contracted from a previous
husband and had managed to hide from doctors until 1969.
   The disease, which she apparently contracted in the 1940s, had
caused atrophy of her brain and caused blindness in her right eye,
said Dr. Henry R. Liss, a neurologist.
   Doctors who examined her observed her hallucinating, speaking to
an imaginary person and making facial grimaces and lip-smacking
sounds, but didn't realize that syphilis caused her ailments. She
was psychotic, schizophrenic, defensive and showed a ``slight tinge
of paranoia,'' Liss said, referring to medical records of different
hospital stays.

<TEXT>
   Authorities feared they would find more
bodies as they searched the rubble of a residential hotel where
fire killed at least three residents and forced others to jump from
windows. Twenty were injured.
   Fire officials today reported at least 14 people missing after
the pre-dawn fire Friday at the three-story, 102-room Fontana Hotel
north of Miami Beach's trendy art deco district. They didn't know
how many died in the fire.
   ``This has the possibility of being a tragedy of large
proportions,'' said Assistant Fire Chief John Reed. ``We do expect
the number of dead to rise.''
   ``I know there are more people in there. There is an old man I
know didn't get out. Oh God, this is unreal,'' said Lynda Holloway,
41, who lived at the residential hotel about a year.
   Many of the nearly 100 residents were retirees. Some fled
leaving behind medication, hearing aids and dentures.
   Reed said officials would decide today whether to pick through
the ruins with body-sniffing dogs or first raze unstable sections
with heavy equipment.
   A special fire assessment team from the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was to help local and state officials
determine the extent of damage and cause of the fire, which quickly
engulfed the lobby and the eastern half of the 39-year-old hotel.
   Mayor Alex Daoud, who opened his house to survivors unable to
find other shelter, said the intensity of the 3 a.m. fire makes it
appear suspicious.
   Reed said only that it may take days before the fire's cause is
established.
   ``We're going to move slowly and look at everything,'' he said.
   Residents _ many of them elderly _ jumped from windows or
spilled out of doorways as fire raced down the hallways. Most
escaped with only the clothes they were wearing.
   ``I just sold my business last Sunday and moved all my things
into that room,'' said Enid Davis, a Jamaican-born beautician who
was at the shelter. ``I lost _ I just don't want to think about it.
I don't have a place to go. I don't even have a dime.''
   Residents received food and aid at an American Red Cross
emergency shelter. Owners of other hotels opened their rooms to
those made homeless.
   Twenty people, ranging in age from 7 months to 90, were treated
for cuts and smoke inhalation. Most were released from hospitals by
Friday afternoon.
   Joe Marcello, 26, was forced to jump from his second-story
window.
   ``There was a point there I really thought I was going to die,''
he said.
   The hotel had smoke alarms but no sprinklers, authorities said.
Under state law, sprinkler systems aren't required in hotels three
stories or taller until 1991.
   ``Over the last 50 years, there has never been a mutiple-death
fire in a building with a complete sprinkler system,'' noted John
Nelson, chief of fire prevention for Florida's fire marshal's
office.
   Ann Karmiller, 87, said she walked down from the third floor by
hanging onto the banister, fleeing so quickly that she left with
nothing but her nightgown, forgetting her dentures, hearing aid and
cane.
   One of the owners, Olimpia Mihai, helped guide residents through
the murky hallways.
   ``She grabbed my hand and helped me out,'' said Jewel Mirsky,
76. ``It was all black. We felt the steps very haltingly. I heard
the noise and the siren went off like mad. The smoke was very
bitter.''

   Terrell County sought recognition, and know
its reputation, like peanut butter, is being spread far and wide.
   Eurie LeGate, executive director of the Chamber of Commerce,
says he was looking for a ``large scale operation'' to ``put our
place on the map.''
   The answer was in Terrell County's $15 million farming industry
_ specifically, peanut farming, the county's top crop. And so The
Peanut Plantin' and Pickin' Phestival was scheduled for April 21.
   Georgia has other peanut festivals, but LeGate said Dawson's
``Phestival'' will feature bluegrass music as well as goobers.
   ``As far as I know,'' he said, ``nobody else does bluegrass with
the peanut one way or another.''
   Tom Riggs, host of the national radio show ``Cornbread
Jamboree'' on the American Bluegrass Network, will host the

   A resident of Peoria, Ill., who heard
about an adopt-a-whale program on the Oregon Coast offered to take
one home. To his swimming pool.
   In a missive to the Lincoln City Chamber of Commerce, the letter
writer noted that gray whales migrate past Lincoln City twice a
year. Surely, he said, local business leaders would know how to
obtain a whale. He wanted one swimming in his backyard.
   Gray whales grow to 45 feet in length and weigh up to 35 tons.
   Once Lincoln City officials determined the writer was sincere,
they passed the letter to Bruce Mate of the Hatfield Marine Science
Center.
   Mate, an associate professor of oceanography at Oregon State
University and a specialist in marine mammals, wrote back to say
the the adopt-a-whale program is intended to ``give people a sense
of personal identity with specific whales and to fund biological
research on these species.''
   ``I'm delighted that some people are willing to translate that
feeling into material contributions,'' Mate said, although it would
be difficult literally to adopt a whale.

   Hundreds of frenzied fans mobbed
Michael Jackson as the reclusive singer joined Donald Trump for a
picture opportunity at Trump's glitzy new Taj Mahal Casino Resort.
   When Jackson rode an elevator down from the penthouse suite he
checked into at the 1,250-room casino hotel Friday, his fans surged
forward and tried to touch him.
   Jackson, dressed in a black hat, black top coat and pinkish-red
shirt, grabbed his hat and bent down to the floor as security
guards formed a human chain to push back the crowd.
   ``You've got somebody in a wheelchair here. Watch it,'' screamed
one woman as the mob pushed its way through the crowded floor.
   Trump and Jackson walked to the floor of the casino, which
opened to gamblers Monday. Then they went to the casino's Mark
Etess Arena, only to cause another frenzy as they emerged 20
minutes later and headed for a nearby cafe.
   Once inside, the doors were locked and the few diners already
there began fighting for Jackson's attention.
   Jackson left through a back entrance, leaving those who got his
autograph or touched him bragging about the experience.
   ``I can't stress how nice he was,'' said Denise Campasano, 29,
of West Babylon, N.Y., with whom Jackson posed for a picture.

   Southern California officials have
adopted what appears to be the nation's first comprehensive policy
to stem global warming and the loss of ozone in the Earth's
atmosphere.
   It was approved unanimously Friday by the governing board of the
regional South Coast Air Quality Management District, the agency
that last year adopted a sweeping anti-smog plan for the Los
Angeles basin.
   Board member Harriet M. Wieder of Orange County alluded to the
region's notoriety for the nation's worst smog, saying, ``Because
of our situation here in Southern California, we should be a leader
on this issue.''
   Although Vermont has adopted a state policy on global warming,
``this is the first government I know of to adopt a regulatory
program,'' said Curtis A. Moore, an environmental consultant based
in McLean, Va.
   The measure proposes restrictions on carbon dioxide and certain
industrial gases causing the destruction of the Earth's protective
ozone layer.
   A four-page statement approved by the board directs the
district's staff to draw up a series of rules and programs that
address global warming and ozone problems. The major provisions
will:
   _Require the recycling of chlorofluorocarbon gases, or CFCs,
from air conditionsers and refrigerators that are serviced or
discarded. Studies have linked CFCs, which are widely used as
refrigerants, to the destruction of ozone in the Earth's outer
atmosphere.
   _Phase out the use of CFCs and halon gases, other
ozone-destroying compounds widely used in fire extinguishers, by
Jan. 1, 1997. A three-year extension would be granted in certain
circumstances.
   _Develop strategies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The
board asked its scientific advisory panel to study the feasibility
of curbing carbon dioxide emissions 20 percent by 2000 and 40
percent by 2010.
   The district also would to support scientific research of
chemicals that could be used as alternatives to CFCs.
   Scientists agree that concentrations of carbon dioxide have
increased in the atmosphere over the past 150 years. Many argue the
gas is raising the planet's temperature by trapping heat in the
atmosphere, but data is inconclusive.
   Environmentalists urged the 12-member board to strengthen its
policy by moving up compliance deadlines.
   ``It is vital for the district to adopt effective,
technology-forcing policies to curb global warming and to halt
depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer,'' said Veronica Kun of
the Natural Resources Defense Council.
   Industry executives attacked the plan.
   ``We believe it is premature to implement a policy that so
clearly assumes there is scientific certainty, especially when the
cost to business, the community and society would be so large,''
said Ross Hopkins, a Lockheed executive who spoke on behalf of the
California Manufacturers Association.
   Hopkins said the district was putting Southern California
businesses at a competitive disadvantage since firms elsewhere
would operate without the cost of compliance.

   Jesse Jackson was the star speaker but Marion
Barry nearly stole the show after he quietly slipped into an
anti-drug meeting of the National Conference of Black Mayors.
   Jackson interrupted his own speech when he spotted the
Washington, D.C., mayor entering the room Friday. ``Come on up, Mr.
Mayor,'' he said, and a crowd of about 400 stood and applauded as
Barry walked to the podium and sat at Jackson's right hand.
   After Jackson's speech, reporters and well-wishers swarmed
Barry, who recently completed seven weeks of chemical dependency
treatment after an arrest on cocaine charges.
   Barry said he saw no irony in his attending the anti-drug
meeting and said his own problem with substance abuse should not be
linked by the media to the proliferation of drugs in his home city.
   ``What about New York? David Dinkins has not had this kind of
personal problem _ personal disease. What about Chicago or Miami,
Florida?'' said Barry.
   Barry has admitted dependency on alcohol and tranquilizers but
has skirted the issue of cocaine abuse. He was arrested Jan. 18
during an FBI sting operation and faces trial on five misdemeanor
cocaine possession charges and three counts of lying to a grand
jury about his drug involvement.
   ``America has a critical need to solve its problem,'' Barry
said. ``I'm not going to be the focus of it. Not me.''
   Barry also was asked about news reports that the Bush
administration is preparing to issue a report that will declare its
own year-old pilot anti-drug program in Washington a failure.
   ``I have not seen the report,'' said Barry. ``I think they're
going to release it next week. But as Jesse Jackson indicated, the
initial approach was wrong.
   ``It was like an exclusionary situation where you come down and
you propose things for us without talking to us.''
   Jackson's speech was a scathing indictment of Bush's war on
drugs.
   He accused the administration not only of failing to get closely
involved with state and local officials involved in the war, but
also of providing too little money and failing to attack the root
causes of drug abuse.
   Among those causes, he said, were poverty and unemployment.
   ``He'll declare a war with the resources and have you fight the
war without resources _ voodoo politics,'' said Jackson, who also
received a standing ovation from the crowd.
   Jackson also reiterated his call for government officials to
develop a plan to make public and private pension funds available
for investment in low-income housing and other programs aimed at
eliminating poverty.

   Top economic officials of the world's seven richest
democracies are opening talks on the financial markets, which have
been jittery over the unexpected fall of the Japanese yen.
   The talks were to begin today and include U.S. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady and finance ministers and central bank
presidents from Britain, Canada, Japan, France, West Germany and
Italy. The nations are known as the Group of Seven, or G-7.
   Japanese officials are expected to appeal for help in driving up
the yen's value, but analysts doubted the other nations would be
quick to come to their aid.
   Stephen King, an international economist at the London
investment firm of James Capel and Co., predicted that ``neither
the United States nor Germany would be willing to help out Japan
that much.''
   Moreover, David Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI-McGraw
Hill in Lexington, Mass., said the yen's rise in recent days has
taken ``a little bit of pressure off the G-7 meeting.''
   The dollar had shot up against the yen in recent weeks, and it
reached a three-year high earlier this week. Since then, the yen
has strengthened some, which analysts say reflects the markets'
uncertainty about the results of the finance meeting.
   Some analysts argued that the United States may agree to
intervene more heavily in the currency markets to try to prop up
the yen. Governments buy and sell currencies in the markets to try
to alter the value of a currency.
   But they ruled out any move by the United States to trim
interest rates at Tokyo's request. Lower U.S. interest rates would
tend to give a lift to the Japanese currency, but American
officials fear they would fuel inflationary pressures at home.
   The G-7 nations have been trying to coordinate economic policies
since a campaign in September 1985 to push the dollar lower as a
way of reducing the U.S. trade deficits.
   In February 1987, the Reagan administration decided the dollar
was weak enough. In the so-called Louvre accord, the major
economies pledged to work to support the dollar at the levels of
that time.
   Analysts disagree about whether the countries are still sticking
to their coordination promises.
   ``There is still some coordination, but it's not as good as it
was,'' said Wyss.
   He said it was easier for the governments to act together when
their economies were on par. But he said the U.S. economy has
slowed while those in Europe continue to expand.
   The ministers' agenda also was to be taken up by the dramatic
events that have unfolded in Eastern Europe since they met in
September.
   West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Karl Otto Poehl,
the president of the West German central bank, were expected to
offer details on plans to form an economic and monetary union this
summer with East Germany.
   The Bonn government has become embroiled in a controversy over
the conversion rate for exchange of the East German currency to the
West German mark.
   The central bank, known as the Bundesbank, has recommended a
2-to-1 rate. That would give East Germans one West German mark for
every two units of their currency, except for small savings'
accounts, which would be traded in at a higher rate.
   East Germans have complained that the proposed rate would
effectively cut in half their wages, pensions and other savings.

<HEAD>President Supports Growing Campaign to Reform Electoral System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Chaim Herzog has given his support to
a growing public campaign to reform the electoral system, which has
put minor political parties in the role of kingmakers and
deadlocked the government.
   By Friday, at least 70,000 Israelis had signed petitions
demanding changes such as direct election of the prime minister and
legislators. Voters now cast ballots for party slates.
   Reformers say the current method does not make legislators
accountable to voters. They also say the system of giving any party
with 1 percent of the vote a seat in parliament gives small parties
too much leverage.
   A wide range of political, religious and student organizations
urged members to attend a protest rally in Tel Aviv today. On
Friday, more than 20 people were on a hunger strike outside the
parliament building.
   In a statement released Friday, Herzog said he ``welcomed the
actions'' of the protesters, but urged them to end the fast so they
would not endanger their health.
   ``The president is for changing the electoral system,'' said
Herzog's spokesman, Giora Pordes.
   The protests came as the left-leaning Labor Party tried to form
a ruling coalition, and the rival right-wing Likud bloc moved to
torpedo Labor's efforts.
   The two parties have been stalemated since the government
collapsed March 15. Labor leader Shimon Peres announced this week
that he put together a majority in the 120-seat parliament, or
Knesset, but would not identify his backers.
   Israel radio reported that Labor signed a deal with Likud
defector Avraham Sharir, a former tourism minister.
   Critics have accused Labor and Likud of using offers of
government money and political jobs to entice small ultra-Orthodox
parties to join their side and allow the formation of a government.
   On Friday, Labor reportedly tried to persuade four wavering
Sharir allies to abandon Likud. Peres has offered one of them,
Economics Minister Yitzhak Modai, the Finance Ministry in a Labor
government, the radio said.
   Modai sought offers from Peres after several Likud leaders
refused his demands for a $2.5 million bank guarantee to back up
the party's promise to make him a Likud Cabinet minister.
   The public campaign against backroom deals with smaller parties
began March 28 when two army reserve officers began a hunger strike
in front of parliament. More than 20 people have joined the strike.
   The hunger strikers have collected more than 25,000 signatures,
in addition to 40,000 gathered by the Association of Americans and
Canadians in Israel, and 5,000 sent to the president by university
students from Haifa and Jerusalem.
   ``The momentum is enormous,'' said political science professor
Ehud Sprinzak, the campaign's organizer in Jerusalem. ``We are
trying to galvanize it into a huge political movement.''
   In addition to Herzog, other prominent Israelis spoke out for
reform Friday, including Natan Sharansky, a former Soviet dissident
and activist for Soviet Jewish immigration.
   Former President Jimmy Carter said Friday he believed peace
prospects would be greatest under a Labor-led government.
   ``My last preference would be another (Labor-Likud) National
Unity Government, which I think reaches the lowest common
denominator of inactivity and stalemate,'' Carter said during a
visit to Stockholm. Likud and Labor have ruled jointly since the
1984 election ended in a stalemate.
   Also Friday, three small left-wing parties courted by Peres
demanded that a Labor government lift some of the harsh measures
imposed by the army to suppress the 27-month-old Palestinian
uprising.

<TEXT>
   A 37-year fight to desegregate schools in
impoverished St. Helena Parish supposedly ended last year when
blacks and whites began attending classes under the same roof.
   But when white school board members fired the black
superintendent, it showed the fight was far from over.
   The firing, which apparently was decided at a closed meeting and
never publicly explained, led Superintendent Perry Spears to take
his firing to court in Baton Rouge, where the federal judge who has
overseen the parish's desegragation once more will take up charges
of racism.
   It led students and teachers to boycott classes, and created a
sense of disbelief in activists who thought their efforts to
integrate schools in this severely depressed rural parish were over
and done with.
   ``If I wasn't in this situation, I'd find it hard to believe,''
said Spears, who is scheduled to leave office June 30 after the
school board ignored his request for a new contract and hired a
white to replace him.
   ``The school board doesn't intend to do what the court tells
them,'' said John Hall, one of the original plaintiffs in the
desegregation suit.
   U.S. District Judge John Parker has scheduled a hearing for
April 19 to hear complaints that Spears' removal was racially
motivated.
   The school board's four white members, who already had made
their decision to oust Spears, announced his replacement at a Jan.
2 meeting where they outnumbered the two black board members who
wanted to keep him.
   ``It came as a total shock,'' Spears said.
   Willie George Lee, one of the black board members, said he knew
nothing about the move until it was put on the agenda at the last
minute.
   ``I think it's unjust,'' Lee said. ``I think he has done an
excellent job.
   Spears, who has worked in the district for 27 years and has been
superintendent for five years, won a state court order to stay on
the job through the end of the school year. Myrtie Wofford, a white
former elementary principal, was hired to replace him.
   After the board refused to explain its reasons for replacing
Spears, about half of the district's teachers stayed out and about
70 percent of the district's 2,000 students boycotted classes for a
week in February.
   The school district is about 70 percent black.
   Desegregation efforts began in the 1952, when a lawsuit was
filed after the district just south of the Mississippi border
refused to build a new school for blacks.
   In January 1989, the school board closed four of the district's
dilapidated school buildings and consolidated all classes into
three buildings. Parker approved the move, although it apparently
was motivated as much by the lack of parish funds to keep all the
schools open as by the integration order.
   Parker had described the district's schools as ``not fit for a
doghouse.''
   The St. Helena Parish system is ranked as one of Louisiana's
poorest; about 95 percent of its financial support coming from the
state.
   Some elementary school students attend classes in converted
mobile homes. One school had to be closed because the district
could not afford the $100,000 needed to remove loose asbestos.
   Attorney Robert Williams, who is representing the plaintiffs in
the desegregation case, said he wants to find out if Spears'
dismissal is the result of racial blacklash.
   ``If this man is carrying out court orders and being retaliated
against, we want the court to do something about it. I don't know
if that's the case,'' Williams said.
   Williams added:
   ``In December, this guy is the greatest thing since ice cream.
In January, you replace him without advertising. No one is saying
what happened. He was replaced by somebody they obviously had
interviewed. Where did you interview her? It obviously was a secret
proceeding. The position was never declared vacant. It was open and
gone in one bold stroke.''
   Spears said two white board members told him they were
pressured, apparently by whites who did not approve of sending
their children to school with blacks.
   ``Both said I'd done a good job, but they just couldn't vote for
me,'' he said.
   Robert Easley, one of the white board members, said he felt it
was time for a change at the helm.
   ``For five years, everything had been in turmoil and everything
had been going for him. We were last on the state test and the
system had just collapsed,'' Easley said.
   ``As far as racism on my part, no sir,'' he said.
   Easley said he was not involved in any interviews for Spears'
replacement. Wofford deferred comment to the board's attorney,
Clifford Speed, who said the allegations involving Spears'
replacement took place before he began representing the district in
March.
   Consolidation of the schools has saved the district money and
enabled schools to offer a wider curriculum, Spears said. In
addition, a breakfast program has been started in the district for
the first time, he said.
   But Easley said public support was lacking for the school system
and was demonstrated last fall when a bond issue was overwhelmingly
defeated.

   U.S. businessmen trying to penetrate Japan's market
often express frustration at the clubby nature of much of this
country's business, and the trade reforms Japan will undertake are
meant to promote competition.
   Japan and the United States announced an agreement on the
reforms Thursday.
   The government issued a report Friday outlining its plans to
change the deep-seated business practices that contribute to the
United States' $49 billion trade deficit with Japan.
   It said the Fair Trade Commission will subject the country's
corporate groups, known as ``keiretsu,'' to audits every two years.
Companies within such a group own each other's stock and buy
products and services from each other, excluding foreign companies
or raising their costs.
   The report said the audits will look at supplier-customer
transactions, financing arrangements and personal ties.
   The commission is to publish its findings and ``take steps,
including stricter enforcement of the Anti-Monopoly Act, to address
anti-competitive and exclusionary practices,'' the report said.
   In addition, government powers to restrict foreign investment or
technology imports on grounds they might adversely affect Japanese
companies will be revised, the report said.
   ``Such restrictions are not needed on a general basis,'' the
report said.
   The commission also promised to simplify procedures for
corporate mergers and acquisitions. Foreigners complain that
present rules hinder them from putting their money to work in Japan.
   The government said, however, there were sound economic reasons
for forming corporate groups.
   In the latest issue of Economic Eye magazine, an analyst,
Ryutaro Komiya, said the groups did not deserve the criticism they
received.
   He said that while the sales of U.S. automaker General Motors
are more than double those of Japan's No. 1 automaker, Toyota,
``its employees are 13 times more numerous.''
   ``Toyota contracts out much of the work that GM handles
in-house. Thus the Toyota group of subcontractors is akin to GM's
internal divisions. It's not a question of good vs. bad business
arrangements,'' Komiya said.
   He said that within a keiretsu, ``a firm will get no sympathy _
or sales _ from other group members with products that are more
expensive or of lower quality than market standards.''
   Another point of contention between the United States and Japan
has been Japan's policies on retailing. The government protects
small shops by requiring large stores to obtain the consent of
their smaller neighbors before opening. The process can take 10
years.
   While refusing to abolish the law, the government promised
revisions, including a shortening of this ``coordination processing
period'' to less than 18 months. If problems persist, the
government may decide in three years to exempt parts of Japan from
the law, the report said.
   The supermarket chain Life Stores Co. said last week it was
suing the government for the equivalent of $6.3 million on grounds
it suffered losses from not being allowed to open a new branch.
   On Friday, Toshiaki Namiki, a spokesman for the company, said
the promise of change would not lead the company to drop its suit.
He said its aim was to attack the law, ``not to win compensation.''
   The United States has argued that the reforms would help
Japanese consumers, who pay some of the world's highest prices
because of the complex distribution system and myriad government
regulations.
   But some consumers see advantages in the small stores. Consumer
groups have said cultural aspects and community relationships
should also be taken into consideration.

   A mother who gave birth so her
leukemia-stricken daughter might be saved with the newborn's bone
marrow said she wants a normal life for the baby despite its
much-publicized prenatal existence.
   ``We've been saving all the articles from magazines and
everything and, when she's old enough to understand, we'll give her
the big scrapbooks,'' Mary Ayala said. ``She will know all about
it.''
   Mary, 43, delivered Marissa Eve at the Queen of the Valley
Hospital, but it does not bring an automatic reprieve for her
daughter Anissa, 18, because the baby will not be ready to donate
marrow for six months.
   Initial tests showed the newborn would be a compatible donor and
it was a ``virtual, 100 percent certainty that Marissa's marrow
cells will be a match for Anissa,'' said Charles Mathews, spokesman
for City of Hope National Medical Center, where the transplant will
be performed.
   The baby was in the headlines since the Ayalas revealed eight
weeks ago that they had conceived her as a last resort to save the
life of Anissa.
   The Ayalas took the step of having another child after waiting
for almost two years for the National Marrow Donor Program to find
a suitable donor.
   But Friday, Mary Ayala said her first thought was for the baby.
   ``We haven't even bothered to ask about the transplant or talked
to City of Hope yet,'' she said. ``I'm going to stay home and take
care of my baby.''
   Anissa said at a news conference she would love her newborn
sister regardless of whether the baby can save her life.
   ``I'm just really glad she's here,'' Anissa said. ``I love my
little sister.''
   Mary Ayala said: ``If I had it to do again, now that it's all
over, I don't think I would change anything. I'm happy everything
has gone the way it has.''
   Leukemia, a cancer of white blood cells, typically is treated by
killing blood-producing cells with chemotherapy or radiation.
Marrow from a matching donor, usually a sibling, is then
transplanted into the leukemia patient so the healthy stem cells
can produce healthy blood cells.
   Dr. Rudolf Brutoco said Anissa could still face a crisis if her
disease advances. ``We're keeping our fingers crossed she stays
healthy,'' he said.
   The baby was delivered Tuesday by Caesarean section without
complications. The baby was handed to the father, Abe Ayala, who
held her as the mother gave her a kiss, doctors said.

   S.C. Johnson and Son Inc. said it was
voluntarily withdrawing its Deep Woods OFF! insect repellent from
retail stores because test animals developed tumors in response to
an ingredient.
   The withdrawal Friday affects about 150,000 cases of aerosol and
pump containers and boxes of towelettes, Johnson spokesman David
Coronna said.
   A company statement called the withdrawal precautionary, saying
it was ``not aware of any reports of adverse human health effects.''
   The action does not involve other Johnson repellents.
   The company said an ingredient that repels biting flies, R-11 or
2 butylene tetrahydro-2-furaldehyde, showed ``adverse effects to
some laboratory animals which were fed high levels of R-11'' in
preliminary research.
   Preliminary data in one test showed laboratory mice developed a
non-malignant tumor, said Roger Grothaus, vice president of
scientific support and government affairs for Johnson.
   Grothaus said R-11 has been used in Deep Woods OFF! for 17 years
and as a repellent ingredient by other companies for many years.
The chemical was being tested for a recertification requirement.
   Coronna had no estimate of the cost of the withdrawal. He said
there was no immediate decision on whether to provide refunds to
customers.
   The company said it was providing a toll-free telephone number,
1-800-558-5252, for customer questions starting Monday.

<HEAD>Dutch Police Release Suspect In Rembrandt Vandalism Incident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dutch police released the jobless
and distraught man arrested for spraying acid onto Rembrandt's
``The Night Watch'' on condition he seek psychiatric help, police
said today.
   The 31-year-old suspect, released late Friday, may still face a
maximimum one-year prison term if convicted of vandalizing the
Netherlands' most famous painting in the Rijksmuseum here, police
spokesman Klaas Wilting said.
   The man was freed shortly after an interview with prosecutors,
who decided to let him go provided he talk to a psychiatrist,
Wilting said.
   It was not immediately clear how psychiatric counseling could be
imposed as a condition for his release. The suspect, a resident of
The Hague, has not been identified, in line with Dutch police
practice.
   The man, described by police on Friday as ``confused,'' was
arrested by museum guards immediately after he sprayed acid on the
huge 1642 Rembrandt.
   Guards immediately applied a neutralizing agent on the painting.
   Damage to the work was minimal, since the acid apparently failed
to eat through the thick layer of veneer protecting the delicate
paint, museum officials said.
   Wilting said the suspect could only be prosecuted for vandalism
``even if it was a very expensive painting.'' That charge carries a
one-year maximum prison term.
   It was the third attack this century on ``The Night Watch,'' the
Dutch master's most vandalized work.
   In 1975, a disturbed schoolmaster made 13 slashes in work with a
knife he had stolen from a restaurant minutes earlier. The man
later committed suicide in a mental asylum.
   During World War I, an umemployed shoemaker slashed the painting
to protest his inability to find work.

<HEAD>Report: Statehood to Cost 10 Percent of Puerto Rico's Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gaining statehood could cause Puerto Rico to
lose up to 100,000 of the 900,000 jobs on the island, according to
a government study.
   The study, released Thursday by the Congressional Budget Office,
addressed the elimination of tax benefits aimed at stimulating
investment in the island, The New York Times reported in today's
editions.
   Private U.S. investment, which now makes up half the island's
$22 billion private investment, would drop 73 percent in a Puerto
Rican state, the study said. Statehood would spell the end of an
estimated $2 billion a year in tax benefits designed to encourage
investment.
   The island, which currently has an $82 million ceiling on
federal money for social programs, would gain an additional $3.6
billion in Federal spending by the year 2000.
   But the net effect of statehood would be a 4.3 percent drop in
the island's gross product by the decade's end, the report said.
   The study is sure to have an impact on the decades-long debate
over statehood, independence or continued commonwealth status for
the island.
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon and other opponents of statehood,
who fear voters would be attracted to statehood by the promise of
additional social programs paid for by Washington, hailed the
report.
   ``My position has always been that the future of Puerto Rico
cannot be decided by how much the people would receive in social
legislation,'' Colon said in the Times.
   Supporters of statehood or independence maintain that the report
failed to take into account certain intangibles, such as the fact
that doubt about the island already has dampened investment, said
former Gov. Carlos Romero Barcelo.
   An independent Puerto Rico would lose federal revenue, but might
be able to maintain investment through incentives to foreign
businesses, the report said.
   Congress commissioned the study from the CBO, its research arm,
to give it direction while it considers a bill to allow a 1991
referendum on Puerto Rico's political future.
   Puerto Rican currently has a 16 percent jobless rate.

<HEAD>Battle Plan Formed to Kill Millions of Crickets in Rural Nevada</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state has declared war on a breed of
crickets that can grow to the size of mice and bite people who
interfere with their ravenous feeding.
   The Mormon crickets, which can reach two inches in length, are
hatching across 700,000 acres in five rural counties in the state's
largest infestation since the 1930s. Near Winnemucca, 150 miles
northeast of Reno, 100 crickets have been counted per square foot.
   ``They're in the canyons right now and our goal is to kill them
before they reach the valleys and the towns where they can do some
real damage,'' Robert Gronowski, director of the Nevada Department
of Agriculture's plant industry program, said Friday.
   ``If we stop them in the mountains I think we've got the problem
licked. But we couldn't wipe out the entire population no matter
what we did,'' Gronowski said.
   Once on the march, the crickets will leave barren land in their
wake, eating the bark off trees and even dining on each other if
food is scarce. They will bite people if disturbed.
   ``Once they start marching it becomes much tougher to stop
them,'' Gronowski said. ``But right now they're still young and
aren't really on the move so we've got an opportunity to do
something to control them.''
   Mormon crickets, which actually are relatives of grasshoppers
and katydids, got their name from an infestation in Utah in the
1800s that ended when sea gulls from Salt Lake City reportedly flew
over the land and ate the insects.
   The battle plan worked out by state and U.S. agriculture
officials begins Tuesday with spreading a poison-laced bran and oil
mixture on egg beds at the mouths of canyons where the insects are
hatching.
   The insecticide isn't harmful to larger animals or people,
according to Gronowski. ``Someone would have to eat a lot of it to
even get sick.''
   Aerial spraying will begin April 23 in infested rural areas
where there aren't any rivers to get polluted by the insecticide.
   The program is expected to cost $25,000 to $80,000, which will
be picked up by the federal government because the infestation is
on Bureau of Land Management property, Gronowski said.
   ``We'll keep the baiting and spraying programs going until the
crickets start laying eggs about July 15,'' he explained. The
insects die after laying their eggs.
   ``That should be the end of the problem but there's no way to
tell if they'll come back like this next year or in 10 years. We'll
just have to wait and see,'' he said.
   If the program doesn't keep the insects out of crops and towns,
Gronowski said authorities might have to get private ranchers and
farmers involved in killing them.
   Agricultural officials say they believe this year's large
infestation occurred because three years of drought allowed large
egg beds to accumulate and there were no extremes of heat or cold
to kill them.

   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat said he has had secret
contacts with Israeli leaders to discuss Middle East peace and the
Palestinian uprising in Isaraeli-occupied lands.
   But later Friday, an Israeli U.N. official in New York
``categorically'' denied any such contacts. The Israeli government
has refused to negotiate the Palestinian question directly with the
PLO, which it considers a terrorist organization.
   Arafat's remarks on Italy's state-owned RAI television were
broadcast hours after the Palestinian leader met for the third time
in eight years with Pope John Paul II.
   Asked whether he had clandestine contact with Israel, Arafat
replied, ``Yes, there is. There are many contacts between the
Palestinian and Israeli leadership.''
   He said former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin ``sent an emissary
with a message for me.'' He said Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
``also did so.''
   Yuval Rotem, spokesman for the Israeli U.N. mission in New York,
denied Arafat's statement. He said Arafat may have referred to
talks Israeli leaders held last summer with Palestinians to advance
an Israeli peace plan.
   ``Arafat and the PLO is a non-starter to any negotiations,''
Rotem said.
   He said Arafat made the latest claim because ``he's looking for
legitimacy from the Israelis.''
   There have been rumors of contact between Israeli and Palestine
Liberation Organization leaders but they had not been independently
confirmed. Israel says the PLO is bent on destruction of the Jewish
state.
   Shamir dismissed Science Minister Ezer Weitzman from Israel's
inner Cabinet last December for having contacts with the PLO.
   The Shamir coalition government collapsed March 15 in a dispute
over a U.S.-backed proposal that calls for preliminary meetings
with Palestinians to discuss proposed elections in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Labor Party backed the plan but it was opposed by Likud, its
coalition partner, led by Shamir.
   Arafat said the messages he had received from the Israeli
leaders regarded ``the intefadeh, some aspects of the peace
initiative, messages that illustrate their point of view about
them.''
   Intefadeh is the Arab name for the Palestinian revolt that began
in December 1987 against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. At least 875 Palestinians and 43 Israelis have died in
uprising violence.
   Asked what Israel wanted, Arafat said: ``With whom are they
going to make peace? With phantoms? With me.''
   He compared Israeli leaders to ostriches for refusing to deal
officially with the PLO.
   ``They put their heads in the sand refusing to face reality,''
he said in comments translated into Italian. ``They don't want to
walk in the direction of history. Some of them think they can hide
the sun with a finger.''
   Earlier Friday, the pope urged the Palestinian leader to pursue
dialogue. Israel criticized the meeting, as it did the two previous
encounters between the pope and Arafat in 1982 and 1988.
   Arafat, on a European trip aimed at increasing pressure on
Israel to negotiate, said Thursday he was willing to meet Israeli
Labor leader Shimon Peres to advance the peace process if the
politician succeeds in his effort to form a government.
   Arafat said he and the pope discussed the Palestinian question
``from all angles, and ways and means of establishing a just,
comprehensive peace.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules Civil Jury Ban Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL TIGHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Superior Court judge said Vermont's
cost-cutting ban on civil jury trials is unconstitutional because
it subjects a fundamental civil right to ``a price tag.''
   But the ruling by Superior Court Judge Frank Mahady only applies
to the case of a widow seeking a $15,000 payment from her late
husband's insurance company. The civil jury trial moratorium will
remain in effect in all other state courts unless judges there make
similar rulings, said John Evers, the Middlebury attorney
representing the widow.
   Jerome F. O'Neill, president of the Vermont Trial Lawyers
Association, said he hopes other judges soon will follow Mahady's
lead.
   ``I certainly expect it will have significant precedential value
in any future case,'' O'Neill said Friday. ``Challenges are pending
around the state and I expect you'll be hearing about them in the
near future.''
   The lawyers association has filed a class-action lawsuit to
overturn the ban, saying it violates the constitutional right to a
speedy trial. That lawsuit is pending in Vermont Supreme Court.
   The widow's suit, which began in 1985, was scheduled to go to a
civil jury trial earlier this year.
   But the state Supreme Court postponed all civil jury trials from
Jan. 22 through June 30 because of cuts in the judiciary's budget.
The courts were ordered by the Legislature to make about $300,000
in cuts this fiscal year, which ends June 30, to help avert a state
budget deficit.
   The moratorium is expected to save about $75,000.
   In his ruling, Mahady said the Seventh Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution and several sections of the Vermont Constitution
guarantee a citizen's right to a trial by jury, both in criminal
and civil matters.
   ``No government official, no branch of government in our free
society dare subject such a right, so honored by our people for
centuries, to a price tag,'' Mahady said.
   ``Placed in the admittedly awkward position of being required to
resolve a conflict between an administrative order of its Supreme
Court and the clear mandate of the Constitution, this Court, with
great respect for the Supreme Court, will stand fast by the
Constitution.''
   Thomas Lehner, Vermont court administrator and clerk of the
Vermont Supreme Court, could not be reached for comment Friday.
   Although the specific impact of this ban is not known, court
officials have said about 50 cases go to jury verdict and another
300-500 cases are called in for jury drawing during a typical
six-month period.

   Economics officials of the seven leading industrial
powers met today to discuss the turmoil in Japan's financial
markets, but they appeared unlikely to do much to prop up the yen
currency.
   ``There's no reason to unnecessarily dramatize developments in
Japan,'' said a senior West German finance official, who spoke to
reporters before the start of daylong talks at the French Finance
Ministry.
   The gathering of the so-called Group of Seven _ Britain, Canada,
France, West Germany, Japan, Italy and the United States _ was the
first formal session of the year.
   The West German official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the yen's recent weakness did not pose a danger to the
international economy.
   ``I don't see any reason to consider the Japanese situation a
medium-term destabilizing factor in the world economy,'' he said.
   But Japanese officials, obviously worried about their
once-mighty currency, were expected to appeal to U.S. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady and the other finance chiefs for help.
   A Japanese official accompanying the finance minister, Ryutaro
Hashimoto, said the industrialized nations believe the decline in
yen was a problem for all.
   The official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
dollar has not strengthened significantly but rather the value of
the yen has fallen. ``That's where the difficulty lies,'' he told
Japanese reporters.
   The value of the dollar reached a three-year high earlier in the
week. The yen has since firmed some, reflecting, according to
analysts, uncertainty about the outcome of the finance ministers'
meeting.
   Brady and Hashimoto were among the string of finance ministers
and central bank presidents who arrived by car at the modern
glass-and-steel building housing the French Finance Ministry on the
eastern edge of Paris.
   The officials' talks were expected to end by early evening. It
was uncertain whether they would issue a statement at the
conclusion.
   In advance of the meeting, analysts said they doubted the United
States and the others would be quick to come to the aid of the
Tokyo government.
   Stephen King, an international economist at the London
investment firm of James Capel and Co., predicted that ``neither
the United States nor Germany would be willing to help out Japan
that much.''
   Moreover, David Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI-McGraw
Hill in Lexington, Mass., said the yen's rise in recent days has
taken ``a little bit of pressure off the G-7 meeting.''
   Some analysts argued that the United States may agree to
intervene more heavily in the currency markets to try to prop up
the yen. Governments buy and sell currencies in the markets to try
to alter the value of a currency.
   But they ruled out any move by the United States to trim
interest rates at Tokyo's request. Lower U.S. interest rates would
tend to give a lift to the Japanese currency, but American
officials fear they would fuel inflationary pressures at home.
   The G-7 nations have been trying to coordinate economic policies
since a campaign in September 1985 to push the dollar lower as a
way of reducing the U.S. trade deficits.
   In February 1987, the Reagan administration decided the dollar
was weak enough. In the so-called Louvre accord, the major
economies pledged to work to support the dollar at the levels of
that time.
   Analysts disagree about whether the countries are still sticking
to their coordination promises.
   ``There is still some coordination, but it's not as good as it
was,'' said Wyss.
   He said it was easier for the governments to act together when
their economies were on par. But he said the U.S. economy has
slowed while those in Europe continue to expand.
   The ministers' agenda also was to be taken up by the dramatic
events that have unfolded in Eastern Europe since they met in
September.
   West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Karl Otto Poehl,
the president of the West German central bank, were expected to
offer details on plans to form an economic and monetary union this
summer with East Germany.
   The Bonn government has become embroiled in a controversy over
the conversion rate for exchange of the East German currency to the
West German mark.
   The central bank, known as the Bundesbank, has recommended a
2-to-1 rate. That would give East Germans one West German mark for
every two units of their currency, except for small savings'
accounts, which would be traded in at a higher rate.
   East Germans have complained that the proposed rate would
effectively cut in half their wages, pensions and other savings.

<HEAD>Jury Awards $3.5 Million in Largest `Vanity Publisher' Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even though ``The Sex Life Of A Football
Referee'' and ``Dogs I Have Known'' didn't make Book-of-the-Month
Club, they still deserved to be promoted.
   That's the finding of a jury, which on Friday awarded $3.5
million in a 13-year-old lawsuit charging one of the nation's
largest ``vanity'' publishers with fraud and deception.
   The $11 million class action suit represents thousands of
authors who have paid up to $8,000 to have their book manuscripts
published by New York-based Vantage Press since 1971.
   ``Vantage operates a sham operation rife with fraud and phantom
editors,'' said Arthur J. Jacobs, attorney for the authors.
   But Laurence Shanahan, a lawyer for the publisher, said,
``Vantage did exactly what it promised these authors,'' by
publishing their works and advertising them in mailings and small
trade publications.
   Vantage publishes about 400 books a year.
   The civil suit claimed Vantage Press _ which advertises ``A
well-known publisher is searching for manuscripts worthy of book
publication'' _ made no effort to sell or promote its authors.
   The plaintiffs note that Vantage has no sales representatives,
produces very limited print runs (150 to 3,000 copies), and
maintains no listing of old titles kept in print.
   Titles published by the company include ``Traffic My Way,'' the
reminiscences of a parking meter man; ``A Guide to the Bathrooms of
the World: Toilets''; and ``Daddy Was An Undertaker,'' which starts
off: ``There's always someone dead in our house.''
   The $3.5 million will be divided among 2,200 authors once the
court stipulates how much the plaintiffs' attorney should receive,
The New York Times reported.
   The trial was held before state Supreme Court Justice Carmen
Ciparick.
   In 1958, the Federal Trade Commission issued an order that
barred Vantage from claiming, among other things, that it printed
only manuscripts of merit and that it aggressively promoted its
books.

   Greece could end up with another coalition
government after voters go to the polls Sunday, and that could mean
a continued impasse over how to deal with growing economic problems.
   Temporary coalitions have run the country since the
scandal-ridden socialists were ousted last year after eight years
in power.
   Opinion polls indicate than no one party will gain a majority in
the balloting for the 300-seat unicameral Parliament, the third
election in less than a year. That would mean that one of Greece's
small parties could have a pivotal role in forming the next
government.
   With 17 percent inflation and a $15 billion budget deficit, the
European Community says Greece is in danger of bankruptcy.
   The economic problems, spurred by the lack of government
cohesion, has led to frustration and violence.
   Leftist terrorists have called for an election boycott and have
set off scores of bombs. Conservatives and Socialists have clashed.
   Constantine Mitsotakis' conservative New Democracy party thinks
it has the best chance of winning the necessary 151 seats for an
absolute majority. In November's elections, it won 148 seats, two
more than it received in the June vote, which knocked Prime
Minister Andreas Papandreou and his Panhellenic Socialist Movement
party from power.
   The conservatives and the small Communist-led Coalition of the
Left and Progress teamed up after the June vote.
   With New Democracy Deputy Tzannis Tzannetakis as premier, the
alliance presided over the indictment of Papandreou and some of his
ministers on charges of involvement in financial scandals and
illegal wiretapping of political opponents. A trial date has not
been set.
   In February, another alliance of the conservatives, socialists
and communists collapsed after it was unable to confront economic
problems or stem a resurgence of urban terrorism.
   Prime Minister Xenophon Zolotas, 86, a former governor of the
Bank of Greece, remains in charge until a new government is chosen.
   If no party wins a majority in the elections, parties with one
or two seats in parliament could wield considerable influence.
   ``I see all parties falling slightly,'' said pollster Panayote
Dimitras. ``But the Coalition (Communists) could fall a little more
because of protest votes that may go to the
Environmentalist-Alternative party or blank ballots.'' He said that
if the environmental party, which won one seat in the last
election, gains one or two more seats, ``they could also become the
key to power.''
   The 71-year-old Papandreou, whose party finished a close second
in November, does not have a specific platform but has promised
stability and progress.
   Mitsotakis, also 71, has promised to increase private investment
as a way to create 100,000 jobs. He ended his campaign Friday with
a rally that drew tens of thousands in Athens.
   ``These elections are not between left and right,'' Mitsotakis
told supporters. ``The real choice is between progress and
regression.''
   Conservatives and socialists disagree over U.S. military bases
in Greece. New Democracy wants the bases and NATO membership,
saying they are essential for defense. The socialists say any
future bases agreement should be put to a referendum.
   Communist leaders offered nothing new in their party platform,
but repeated their pledge to protect workers' rights.

   A helicopter flew low over
Strangeways Prison early today to disturb the sleep of rebellious
inmates, and barking dogs, shouting guards and spotlights were also
used to wear down a weeklong siege.
   Prison governor Brendan O'Friel told reporters that fewer than
25 prisoners remained inside the prison, which was heavily damaged
in a riot that broke out at a chapel service on Sunday.
   ``We have been using a certain amount of noise tactics to reduce
the, in our view, unauthorized access of prisoners to the media,''
O'Friel said. ``We have continued to put pressure on the prisoners
in other ways.''
   But he said authorities still hoped to negotiate an end to the
impasse.
   Earlier, lines of shouting prison officers beating nightsticks
on riot shields and accompanied by barking guard dogs marched into
the building where the defiant inmates are holed up behind
barricades.
   Inmates appeared on the roof, and one was heard chanting: ``We
won, we won, you lost.''
   A flickering strobe light played repeatedly over the roof of the
prison in the northern city of Manchester.
   On Friday, prison authorities used blaring rock music and a
wailing helicopter siren to drown out inmates shouting from the
rooftop to reporters outside the prison's perimeter wall.
   The Home Office said two more prisoners surrendered Friday.
   Prisoner Derek White, 46, died in North Manchester Hospital on
Tuesday of injuries he suffered at the hands of other inmates when
the riot began. White had been in Strangeways awaiting trial on
charges of indecently assaulting three children.
   Child molesters, convicted policemen, and some other groups are
regarded with particular loathing by other prison inmates.
   White's death was the only confirmed fatality resulting from the
riot.
   But speculation that at least four other prisoners were killed
by fellow inmates on Sunday increased when a lawyer for 40
prisoners who surrendered said Friday that several reported
witnessing killings.
   Lawyers for other prisoners had heard similar tales, the
attorney, Frank Sinclair, said.
   The reports cannot be checked until staff have access to the
entire prison.
   Strangeways housed prisoners of all categories, from extremely
dangerous to low risk.
   Strangeways Prison, which was built in 1868 to house 970 male
prisoners, had 1,648 when the riot there broke out during a service
in the prison chapel.
   On Thursday, prisoner Paul Taylor, 28, a self-professed leader
of the rampage, shouted through a makeshift bullhorn to a TV crew
perched on a roof opposite the prison.
   He said he had grabbed the chaplain's microphone during the
service as a prelude to a planned sit-in to protest conditions in
the overcrowded jail. He said he had not meant to start a riot.
   When Taylor started shouting through the bullhorn Friday, the
authorities set up a counterblast of noise.
   In a separate incident 80 miles southeast of Manchester, 36
inmates at Glen Parva center for young offenders at Leicester
surrendered to guards before dawn today. The prisoners had held the
guards at bay more than seven hours, the Home Office said.
   It said the protest at the Glen Parva center began Friday night
when 60 inmates overpowered a guard. He was taken to a hospital
with a dislocated shoulder. Twenty-four of the 60 surrendered later
Friday night, and the other 36 held out until early today.
   Glen Parva houses 770 young male offenders ages 16 to 20. The
Home Office said the cause of the disturbance was being
investigated.

<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas said today that
they dealt a major blow to the Afghan government when they turned a
surrender ceremony for 10,000 guerrillas into a surprise attack.
   Najibullah Lefrey, information minister of the self-proclaimed
rebel government-in-exile, said Friday's guerrilla attack in Herat
Province was a setback to President Najib's claims that tens of
thousands of rebel fighters are changing sides and embracing his
Soviet-backed government.
   Jamiat-i-Islami, considered the most effective of the seven
Pakistan-based fighting forces, claimed the surprise attack on the
Herat plains was planned five months ago to trap government forces.
It apparently was intended to avenge a similar deadly trick by
government forces 11 years ago.
   The guerrillas had invited Afghan officials to what they said
would be the surrender of 10,000 rebels, but instead opened fire on
their hosts, setting off a gun battle that left many dead on both
sides.
   Western diplomats in Pakistan said on condition of anonymity
that they had reports that up to five Afghan generals were killed
or wounded in the 15-minute gun battle and in hand-to-hand combat
with knives and pistols. They also said civilians, including
children, died in the fighting on the plains outside Herat, 400
miles west of the Afghan capital of Kabul.
   Government-run Kabul radio said at least a dozen people were
killed, including Lt. Gen. Jalal Razaminda, who is also deputy
security minister, a second unidentified general, civilians and
nine guerrillas.
   An official rebel news agency, MIDIA, claimed that six generals,
25 Communist Party members and several top government bureaucrats
were killed in the attack. The agency said 100 others were injured.
   The guerrillas lured government troops into the ambush saying
they would surrender their weapons and support the national
reconcilation policy of Soviet-backed President Najib. The
government uses the term ``national reconcilation'' to signify
agreement by local guerrilla groups to switch sides and either stop
fighting or help the Marxist government in the war it has fought
with rebels since seizing power in a 1978 coup.
   The government says tens of thousands of rebels have laid down
their weapons in the past year.
   Diplomats based in Kabul and a small group of foreign
journalists were flown to Herat for the ceremony and dove for cover
during the intense, close-range battle, Kabul radio said.
   The radio said 2,200 armed guerrillas and 8,000 unarmed rebels
had gathered on the plains about 25 miles from the city of Herat
for the surrender ceremony.
   The guerrillas _ with weapons ranging from side arms to
recoilless cannons, missiles and rocket launchers _ opened fired at
the government officials and soldiers. Western diplomats and rebel
leaders said the guerrillas fired the first shot when the
provincial governor, Fazle Haq Khaliq Yaar, embraced an
unidentified guerrilla commander dressed in a white robe and turban.
   Yaar was reportedly wounded in the incident.
   The diplomats said the governor's guards immediately returned
fire and the ceremony became a pitched battle, with massive
exchanges of gunfire.
   The diplomats said the shooting stopped when two Afghan army
tanks moved in with bursts of fire.
   An Afghan national TV cameraman was reported shot in the head
and badly wounded in the fighting.
   ``In order to stop the propaganda show of the puppet regime,
some mujahedeen (holy rebels) decided to give their lives to kill
the people responsible for the show,'' Lefrey said. ``This attack
shows that the puppet regime has just been launching a lot of
propaganda about national reconciliation.''
   ``No one is joining the regime. They just parade the militia for
show and say they are mujahedeen,'' he said.
   Najib has organized thousands of Afghan villagers into milita
forces to supplement his army.
   The rebels have been fighting for 12 years to topple successive
communist governments in Afghanistan. They are supported by the
United States, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states.
   After the last Soviet soldiers ended nine years of direct
intervention in Afghanistan in February 1989, Western diplomats
predicted Najib would fall within weeks or months. But the rebels
has been partially paralyzed by bitter infighting and have failed
to win any major battle.
   Najib emerged a formidable opponent, taking the political
initiative with offers to end the fighting.
   Herat was the first region in Afghanistan to rise against the
government in early 1979 before the Red Army stepped in to bolster
the Marxist government.
   The Soviet Union withdrew its troops in February 1989 but still
sends huge quantities of supplies and weapons to the Kabul
government.

   A Long March 3 rocket blasted into space today
bearing a U.S.-made telecommunications satellite, marking China's
debut into the international satellite launching business.
   Applause broke out in the launch control room after the rocket's
flaming tail disappeared into the black skies over the Xichang
Satellite Center in southwest China's Sichuan province.
   The launch, shown live on Chinese Central Television for the
first time in China's 20-year-old satellite program, was delayed
more than an hour because of bad weather. It finally took place at
9:30 p.m. (8:30 a.m. EDT) and appeared to go smoothly.
   China hopes the successful sendoff of the 2,750-pound AsiaSat
satellite will attract more customers who face long waits for
launches by Western Europe's Ariane consortium and private U.S.
companies.
   China has put 26 satellites of its own in space, including at
least five with Long March 3 rockets. But the official China Daily
newspaper said that launching the AsiaSat and other foreign
satellites would ``amaze the world.''
   ``Most foreigners, and Chinese citizens too, think of China as
the land of the bicycle,'' it wrote. ``They may have to adjust that
image.''
   The AsiaSat satellite was made by the U.S. Hughes Aircraft Co.,
and its launch was nearly blocked by a ban on weapons exports to
China imposed after the June killing of pro-democracy protesters in
Beijing.
   But in a conciliatory and controversial move, President Bush
waived the ban for it and two other Hughes satellites being made
for an Australian company. China is to launch them in 1991 and 1992.
   Sabotage of nearby communications lines also nearly disrupted
the launch, according to a local radio report last month. It said
two men were arrested for allegedly cutting, sabotaging or stealing
communications lines between the launch site and the monitoring
base 220 miles away in the provincial capital, Chengdu. The
sabotage occurred from November 1988 through January, the report
said, and no motive was given.
   The AsiaSat satellite is on its second trip into space. It was
launched in 1984 as the Westar-6 but failed to reach its proper
orbit. It was recovered by the U.S. space shuttle and sold to the
Asia Satellite Telecommunications Co. Ltd., a Hong Kong-based
consortium with Chinese, British and Hong Kong partners.
   Once in geostationary orbit _ always staying above the same spot
on the earth's surface _ it will be used to transmit television,
telephone and other communications signals to Asian countries.
Burma and two Hong Kong companies have signed contracts to use it,
and Thailand, Pakistan, South Korea, Nepal and other countries have
signed letters of intent.
   It is estimated to have a 10-year lifespan.

   NASA prepared its countdown today
for launch of the shuttle Discovery after replacing a dirty
television camera lens that will help in the deployment of the
powerful Hubble Space Telescope.
   Countdown for Tuesday's liftoff was to begin at 3 p.m. EDT, an
hour after the scheduled arrival of Discovery's five astronauts.
   The $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope will be capable of
detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater
clarity than the best ground-based observatory.
   It is to orbit 380 miles above Earth for 15 years, enabling
astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant that their light
has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years.
   Air Force weather forecasters today said they expect a 60
percent chance of favorable weather at launch time. The forecast
was somewhat worse than Friday's predictions, which calculated the
chance of good weather at 80 percent, because of the expectation of
strong surface winds.
   But NASA test director Terry Willingham said launch preparations
``are proceeding smoothly.''
   Overnight, technicians discovered four faulty connectors on one
of the shuttle's three main engines. The cables were removed for
repair or replacement, and the problem ``should be no impact at all
on the schedule,'' Willingham said.
   The launch window for Tuesday extends for 2{ hours, beginning at
8:47 a.m. EDT. It is the longest period of opportunity for launch
since the Challenger mission in 1986 that ended in tragedy,
Willingham said.
   ``We want to give ourselves every opportunity to get this launch
off in the first few days,'' Willingham said.
   Technicians discovered the spotty lens during a routine check
Friday afternoon. They removed the television camera from the
orbiter and replaced the lens within two hours.
   Mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will use the 50-foot-long
robot arm to deploy the telescope on the second day of the five-day
mission. A spot on the television camera lens might have hampered
his view.
   Hawley said he has practiced deploying the 24,250-pound
telescope dozens of times and is prepared for just about anything
that might go wrong.
   ``I'm confident we can do it under almost any circumstance,'' he
said. ``NASA's real good at what-ifs, and we've done a lot
what-ifs. What if this part doesn't work? What if the arm fails
completely?''
   Mission specialists Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan,
veteran spacewalkers, will go out to help remove or fix the
telescope, if necessary.
   NASA planned to stop charging the telescope's nickel-hydrogen
batteries today.

   A man firing a shotgun and a rifle
randomly from his apartment building wounded seven people before
police shot and arrested him, authorities said.
   The victims included a bridesmaid whose wedding party was
driving past the building at the time, police said.
   ``He just turned his gun on anything that moved,'' said Ron
Hayes, an ambulance official in this resort city on Australia's
east coast.
   The 26-year-old man, armed with a high-powered rifle and a
shotgun, began firing from his high-rise building, then came
outside and continued shooting, officials said. The gunman was
subdued by police, who wounded him in the arm, said spokesman
Constable David Austin.
   The assailant, who was not identified, was undergoing surgery
for a bullet wound and was expected to be charged later, Austin
said.
   ``We are not, at this stage, prepared to release any further
details,'' the spokesman said in a telephone interview.
   The gunman's victims included a 78-year-old woman who was hit by
three bullets and hospitalized in serious condition, and a
bridesmaid who was shot in the leg as she traveled in a car with
other members of a wedding party.
   The nursing supervisor at a local hospital, who identified
herself only as Sister Allen, said that aside from the elderly
woman the six other victims were in stable condition, she said.
   In addition to those wounded, a woman was treated for shock.
   The nursing supervisor confirmed the gunman was hospitalized.

   Jurors in John Poindexter's Iran-Contra trial
began a sixth day of deliberations today in the coverup case
against the former national security adviser.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene decided Friday to have the
jury meet for a full day today.
   The panel of eight women and four men began considering the five
criminal charges against Poindexter on Monday.
   The 12 were sequestered Tuesday, after news organizations
contacted two members of the panel. The jury last sent a note to
the judge on Thursday.
   Poindexter is charged with conspiracy, two counts of obstructing
Congress and two counts of making false statements. Each count
carries a maximum five-year prison term and $250,000 fine on
conviction.
   There are approximately 100 exhibits in the Poindexter case. The
prosecution presented 10 witnesses in 7{ days of testimony. The
defense called 15 witnesses in 5{ days.
   Deliberations took 12 days before a verdict was reached in the
trial last year of Poindexter's aide, Oliver North. There were 12
criminal charges against North and he was convicted on three of
them. More than 250 exhibits were introduced during eight weeks of
testimony in the North trial.
   Poindexter allegedly covered up North's military assistance to
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels and the U.S. role in a November 1985
shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   North testified that he balked at meeting with members of the
House intelligence committee, but that Poindexter sent him anyway.
   North said he lied to the lawmakers by denying he was giving
military advice to the Contras but insisted it was his own idea to
lie, not Poindexter's.
   The former National Security Council aide testified that he saw
Poindexter tear up a presidential document that ratified the Nov.
25, 1985, CIA-assisted shipment of Hawk missiles from Israel to
Iran.
   The document, called a finding, depicted the United States as
being involved in an arms-for-hostages swap, something Reagan had
said he would never do.
   Reagan was the main witness for the defense, giving about eight
hours of videotaped testimony that was shown to the jury. The
former president said he didn't think Poindexter made any false
statements to Congress.

history of violent behavior behind bars, 42-year-old ``Basher''
Bates comes across as a changed man. He works and eats alongside
Catholic prisoners. He has discovered Christ. He makes no excuses
for his crimes.
   The new Bobby Bates is a product of Maghaberry Prison, which
opened in 1986 as an alternative lockup for inmates who want to
leave the ``paramilitary'' milieu, learn a skill and one day return
to a peaceful life outside prison.
   Left behind in the older Maze Prison outside Belfast are the
truly committed, still segregating themselves into Republican
(Catholic) and Loyalist (Protestant) cellblocks, still refusing to
work or do anything else that could be read as acknowledging that
their offenses were criminal, not political.
   Simply by choosing Maghaberry instead of the Maze, a prisoner
tacitly signals he is removing himself from the battleground and
rehabilitation can begin.
   Maghaberry is part of the quiet transformation of Northern
Ireland's prison system in the decade since the Maze seethed with
protest and 10 inmates, led by Bobby Sands of the Irish Republican
Army, captured world attention by fasting to death.
   The government has always seen self-imposed segregation as a
perpetuation of the conflict between Republicans fighting to rid
Northern Ireland of British rule, and Loyalists fighting to
maintain the union with Britain.
   Attempts to force integration have invariably met resistance.
Indeed, the one jail where tension persists is Belfast Prison,
where about 650 pre-trial inmates are demanding segregation.
   Several Belfast guards have been beaten in recent months and
four have been fired, prosecuted or suspended since 1983 for
mistreating prisoners. A mass breakout was foiled in October.
   Since Maghaberry opened, 164 Maze prisoners have gone there by
choice. Now, two years after it became fully operational, it has
about 275 prisoners and 520 are in the Maze.
   Had Bobby Bates not moved to Maghaberry, he probably would have
stayed in jail for the rest of his life as recommended by the
judge. Now he may stand a chance of freedom in the next decade.
   The Prison Service felt confident enough to invite four foreign
journalists to visit Maghaberry and the Maze last month and chat in
private with prisoners. The only condition was that no prison
officials be identified, because they are targets for assassination.
   ``I think the government is anxious to get the prisoners out as
much as anybody else,'' said the Rev. Denis Faul, a Catholic priest
and human rights campaigner in close contact with prison
authorities and prisoners' families.
   ``There are very many people in prison, both from the Protestant
and the Catholic side, who would not normally be in prison ... for
any type of crime other than a politically motivated crime,'' he
said in an interview.
   Nearly 2,800 people have been killed in Northern Ireland since
sectarian violence began in August 1969. The violence has declined
in recent years.
   The number of security offenders sentenced, once forecast to
reach 3,000, is about 800. Many were jailed 10 years ago or more,
and the government has been persuaded that at least some can be
freed without risk.
   Well-behaved prisoners with release dates are eligible for a
week's furlough at summer and Christmas. Some prisoners
incarcerated in Britain have been moved to Northern Ireland to be
nearer their families.
   Most prisoners on fixed sentences can expect one-half off if
they behave, as opposed to one-third in Britain.
   Four prisoners were learning bricklaying in a Maghaberry
workshop. One, an IRA man serving life for killing a soldier, said
he left the Maze ``because I didn't fancy that environment
anymore.''
   He was 34, had served 14 years and expected to be released in
1992. He went home last summer and at Christmas.
   ``I met people my age who are married with kids, settled down,''
he said. ``The amount of people I didn't know! It was like there
was a gulf between myself and my family.''
   Did he have regrets? ``It was something you got caught up in and
you thought it was worth it ... but in retrospect, you wouldn't
have done it.''
   Working beside him was a Loyalist doing life for aiding and
abetting a murder. He had a wife and four children. ``All those
years lost,'' he remarked. ``A life completely wasted.''
   No such sentiments are expressed at the Maze, a maximum-security
sprawl of H-shaped cellblocks.
   Republicans and Loyalists, locked in separate uprights of each
H, never meet or work. They have their own gyms, exercise yards,
billiard tables and libraries.
   Why not move to Maghaberry? ``Because it's saying, `Forget your
Republicanism and become part of a criminal system,''' an IRA lifer
said. ``But we are not criminal prisoners. We are political
prisoners.''
   IRA supporters argue that the journalists' visit is a propaganda
exercise, that abuses do occur in Belfast Prison and at police
interrogation centers.
   They maintain Britain has no right to be in Ireland at all, let
alone to jail people who see themselves as freedom fighters.
   ``We say Northern Ireland as a concept is illegal and should
never have been set up,'' said a Maze Republican, on whose cell
wall hung portraits of Che Guevara and Jesus Christ.
   Conversation kept moving back to 1983, when 38 prisoners escaped
from the Maze in a mass breakout and half were recaptured
immediately. One told a reporter of being beaten and set upon by
dogs.
   The Prison Service doesn't deny the abuses but says they
happened in the heat of the immediate aftermath of the breakout,
and that the violence was mutual, leaving one prison officer dead
and several injured. It insists abuses could not happen now.
   Compensation was paid to 19 prisoners who alleged being
assaulted, but no prison official was ever disciplined for the 1983
incidents.
   Last month, an Irish court ruled against extraditing two Maze
escapees, believing they might face reprisals.
   Faul said there had been ``no serious incident of brutality
since 1983'' in any of Northern Ireland's four prisons.
   ``By and large, allowing for the difficulty of imprisoning large
numbers of men and so on, conditions have been excellent,'' Faul
said.
   He supported the Irish court decision, and said: ``The British
can only blame themselves. If they had put the prison officers on
trial or had dismissed them, and could show that to the court, then
the prisoners would have been sent back.''
   In Faul's view, whatever improvements are made in the lives of
Northern Ireland's Catholic minority are undermined by ``the
non-accountability of the security forces _ British army, police,
prison officers _ for killing and ill-treating persons.''
   This, he said ``is one of the major problems that's keeping the
IRA in existence.''

<HEAD>20 Killed in South African Violence; ANC Schedules Talks with
Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   Black factions battled police
and each other in fighting that left 20 people dead, including two
infants, police reported today.
   Also today, the African National Congress and South Africa's
government announced that they would hold their first discussions
on the country's political future in Cape Town on May 2.
   The meeting, originally scheduled for Wednesday, was postponed
by the ANC to protest the police shooting of protesters in a black
township on March 26.
   In today's violence, police said they fired shotguns at a crowd
in Kokosi township southwest of Johannesburg after firebombs and
stones were thrown at a police vehicle, injuring one policeman.
   Police said ``a 32-year-old woman was wounded, and regrettably,
a child which she had been carrying was fatally injured'' by the
gunfire.
   In Natal province, where supporters of the ANC have been
battling members of the Zulu-based Inkatha movement, 19 people were
reported killed.
   A police report said 14 people were killed there today and
Friday night, including an infant, three women and 10 men. The
report also said that five bodies were discovered in Natal Thursday
by the local KwaZulu homeland police.
   Police reported that activists fired automatic weapons at police
separating black groups in Natal, but no casualties were reported.
   Police have been accused of favoring Inkatha in the fighting
that has taken 86 lives in less than two weeks.
   President F.W. de Klerk last week ordered extra police units and
soldiers into northern Natal to halt the political feuding,
slayings, clashes, ambushes and looting that has killed about 4,000
people since 1986.
   ANC leader Nelson Mandela, 71, is scheduled to arrive in Lusaka,
Zambia's capital, on Sunday for a three-day visit to discuss the
township violence and plan for his meeting with de Klerk, the ANC
said.
   Lusaka has been the headquarters of the ANC since the
anti-apartheid group was outlawed 30 years ago.
   De Klerk invited ANC leaders to preliminary talks as a step
toward formal power-sharing negotiations.
   He said he wants to negotiate a new constitution that will give
power to the black majority of 28 million, but provide the nation's
5 million whites a veto over major policy decisions.
   The ANC has repeatedly demanded majority rule.
   Mandela was freed last month after 27 years of imprisonment for
anti-government activities. The ANC and other anti-apartheid groups
also were legalized as a prelude to political negotiations.

   Eight gunmen who ambushed an armored
car and carried off several duffel bags of booty left their victims
laughing about the loss of leftovers and a pair of old shoes.
   The armored car had just delivered money to three branches of
Metrobank on Friday and was empty, except for the personal
belongings and breakfast leftovers stuffed inside the bags, police
Sgt. Wilfredo Ramos said.
   The robbers, wearing combat fatigues and armed with automatic
rifles, used their jeep to pull over the armored car in suburban
Malabon and began firing at the van's four tires, Ramos said.
   The armored car's security escorts surrendered their two
shotguns before opening rear doors to allow the robbers to scoop up
several duffel bags. The robbers fled quickly, apparently without
checking the bags.
   Police were surprised to find the guards laughing when they
arrived. Among the personal items reported missing was ``a smelly,
worn-out pair of shoes,'' Ramos said.

   A college student accused of stuffing her
newborn son in a dormitory toilet was found innocent of murder by
reason of insanity today by jurors who at one point had declared
themselves deadlocked.
   Claire Hilary Moritt fell into the arms of her defense attorney
and exclaimed, ``I knew in my gut I wasn't guilty,'' after the
acquittal was read. Family and friends burst into applause and
tears.
   ``I thank God and everybody who helped me get through this,''
the tall, slim 18-year-old defendant said. ``I love you all.''
   Hillsborough Circuit Judge Richard Lazzara said he did not
believe hospitalization was necessary in light of the insanity
finding but said Ms. Moritt should remain under psychiatric care.
   The Hillsborough Community College student from Hollywood was
charged with first-degree murder in the Oct. 23 drowning of her
newborn, 6-pound, 9-ounce boy. If convicted of that charge, she
would automatically have been sent to prison for life with the
possibility of parole only after 25 years.
   Dormitory roommates heard a baby's cries before finding Ms.
Moritt in the bathroom covered in blood and rushed her to the
hospital. When they returned to dorm to clean up, they found the
baby stuffed headfirst in the toilet and covered with bloody towels
and sheets.
   Defense attorneys argued that Ms. Moritt was temporarily insane,
suffering from a dissociative disorder that left her with no memory
of being pregnant or even giving birth.
   Nine psychiatrists and psychologists backed up that defense
during the trial, but prosecutors blasted it all as
``psychobabble.''
   ``She's attempting to flee _ not physically but mentally _ from
the scene of the crime,'' Assistant State Attorney Stephen Crawford
told the jury in closing arguments. ``Don't let her do it.''
   The Hillsborough Circuit Court jury declared itself deadlocked
Friday after 16 hours of deliberations but reached agreement after
another hour behind closed doors today.
   Ms. Moritt ignored the advice of her lawyer and stood before the
judge late Friday night to say she wanted jurors to press on.
   ``I'm prepared to declare a mistrial. Do you want me to declare
a mistrial?,'' Lazzara asked the woman.
   ``No,'' she said, bursting into tears.
   The judge gave her a chance to compose herself and come back,
but her response was the same.
   Lazzara warned defense counsel that urging on the weary jury
could be foolish for his client.
   ``I want to be careful not to hold this jury hostage. It could
backfire on the defendant. I want you to know that,'' Lazzara told
defense attorney B. Anderson Mitcham.
   Never in his 27-year legal practice had he advised his client to
turn down a mistrial, Mitcham said, but he added that he was bound
to follow the wishes of his client, her mother and father.
   Outside court, the defense attorney explained that the stress of
the two-week trial was taking a toll on the defendant and her
family.
   ``She was charged with first-degree murder, she was under the
care of a psychiatrist, and consider the enormous sums of money
they spent trying to defend this case,'' Mitcham said.
   Ms. Moritt reportedly rejected numerous plea deals for reduced
sentences because she did not want to spend even one day in prison.

   A ferry with about 240 people aboard
capsized during gale-force winds on a river in southern Burma,
killing 30. More than 180 people were reported missing and feared
dead, official Rangoon radio said.
   The double-decker boat, the Sein San Pya, sank almost
immediately when the storm struck Friday, the report said.
   The ferry was on a regular run on the Gyaing River from Moulmein
east to Kyondo in southern Tenasserim province. Moulmein is about
100 miles southeast of the capital, Rangoon.
   The bodies of 25 women and five men were recovered, 25 people
were rescued and 186 were missing and feared dead, the radio
reported. An earlier broadcast had said that 50 people were saved.

   A suspicious fire swept through a ferry
carrying about 490 people in the North Sea before dawn today,
killing at least 75 people and leaving about 75 missing and
presumed dead, authorities said.
   The manager of the Danish company that operated the
American-owned ship, which was carrying Danish and Norwegian
tourists, said he believed the tragedy was caused by arsonists who
set two fires on separate decks.
   The dead were found in cabins and on the car deck, where many
people were apparently sleeping in their vehicles on the overnight
trip from Norway to Denmark aboard the 10,000-ton Scandinavian
Star, officials said.
   ``There was a lot of smoke and flames. It looked rather
horrible,'' helicopter pilot Nils Martinsson, who helped in the
rescue, told Swedish radio.
   Firemen found 75 bodies on the burning vessel, said Elsebeth
Roalso of the Coastal Rescue Center at Sola, Norway.
   Seventy-five people were missing and presumed dead, said
Christer Waldegren, spokesman for the Swedish Sea Rescue Center at
Goteborg. About 340 people were rescued and taken to ports and
hospitals in Norway, Sweden and Denmark. More than 20 of them were
injured.
   Passenger and crew lists were not immediately available, and
this led to confusion about the numbers and identities of those on
board, officials said.
   About 200 passengers were Norwegians and the rest were Danes,
officials said. Most were young people, families and retirees on a
weekend trip.
   Helicopters and boats rescued the survivors from the 465-foot
ship and from life boats. Early news reports said passengers had
jumped into the near-freezing waters, but that could not be
confirmed.
   Aage Danielsen, a Norwegian rescue vessel captain, said the
missing passengers were believed still on the ferry.
   The ship is owned by the Miami-based SeaEscape Ltd., registered
in the Bahamas, and had Norwegian officers and a Portuguese crew.
Officials at SeaEscape could not immediately be reached for comment
in Miami.
   Ole Hansen, managing director of Vognmandstruten, the Danish
shipping company that operated the ferry, was quoted on Danish
radio as saying he was virtually certain the blaze was the result
of arson. Hansen said two separate fires broke out on the ship, the
first at about 2:30 a.m.
   Officials gave no immediate details on how the fires may have
started or what would have motivated someone to set fires that
would have endangered them too. A blaze aboard the ship in 1988 was
blamed on a leaky oil pipe.
   Waldegren said the blaze was under control but still burning 12
hours later. He said the ferry was being towed to Lysekil, Sweden,
140 miles southeast of Oslo.
   The fires broke out in the aft section of the ferry as it sailed
in the Skagerrak strait from Oslo to the Fredrikshavn in Denmark.
   The captain reported the first fire as the ferry was about 40
miles south of the Norwegian Ferder Island in the outer Oslo fiord,
or just west of the Swedish Vaeder islands.
   The crew quickly extinguished the fire, then discovered a larger
blaze one deck below, reports said.
   ``When we came, there was a strong fire in the aft and strong
smoke developing, and then only 30 to 45 minutes later it started
burning also on the port side,'' Martinsson said.
   Rescued passengers said they heard no fire alarm but were
awakened by the smell of smoke.
   Rescuers equipped with smoke-breathing apparatus searched the
ferry for possible survivors, according to the coastal rescue
center at Sola, near Stavanger, 180 miles west of Oslo.
   Bettina Kold, 20, a Danish employee in a retail shop on the
Scandinavian Star, was quoted by NTB as saying her alarm clock woke
her more than two hours after the fire began. She said she could
not escape through smoke-filled corridors and was unable to break
open her cabin window.
   She waited 90 minutes until a rescuer helped her out.
   Nearby vessels responded to the ferry's distress call.
   Soviet and West German freighters helped Norwegian and Swedish
vessels pull survivors from lifeboats and ferry them to ports in
Sweden, Norway and Denmark.
   Two tugs poured water into the Scandinavian Star.
   Soeren Kamp Knudsen, the Frederikshavn police chief, told Danish
radio that police would investigate a possible link to previous
ferry fires in Scandinavian waters.
   Earlier fires include one on the ferry Holger Danske near Oslo
in September 1988 in which no one was killed. In February 1989, two
crew members were injured in a fire on the King of Scandinavia,
between Copenhagen and Oslo.
   NTB said the Scandinavian Star had been chartered for one week
on the Oslo-Fredrikshavn route by the Danish company Vognmannsruten.
   A fire aboard the ship occurred in March 1988 off Cancun,
Mexico, and was caused by leaking oil in the engine room. No one
was injured.
   The U.S. National Transportation Safety board concluded that
blaze was caused by inadequate maintenance, and it said the ship's
crew lacked training in firefighting procedures.

<HEAD>Speaker, 40 Pounds Lighter, Rarely Throws Weight Around</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 10 months as speaker of the House, Tom
Foley's most noticed accomplishment may be a remarkable 40-pound
weight loss.
   Shedding the pounds, and with it any comparison to former
speaker Tip O'Neill, came more quickly and apparently with greater
ease than his first major legislative victory: passage of a child
care bill.
   Foley made the bill one of his top priorities the day he became
speaker last June, but he let it drag on and turn into a test of
his mettle.
   This year he set an end-of-March deadline, and met it.
   ``I would say the first quarterly report of the Foley leadership
is going to be a positive one, if for no other reason than the
passage of this bill,'' a top lieutenant, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md.,
said after the House passed the measure late last month. The bill
provides tax credits and other assistance to parents for child care.
   Pushing through a clean air bill and campaign reform will pose
similar tests this year.
   When Foley became speaker last June after Jim Wright of Texas
resigned because of an ethics investigation, he was warmly greeted
as a conciliator with the added quality of television presence. He
and his fellow Democratic leaders offered a more modern face for
the congressional majority to counter the Republican White House's
media savvy.
   Any real measurement of his performance at this point is
premature, House colleagues and outside observers say. The initial
grades are mixed at best.
   His ability to win legislation has shown promise, but his
unwillingness to lead or even join in a partisan charge against the
Bush administration is rated a disappointment by many.
   Foley shrugs off such criticism, saying, ``We're unwilling to
simply be an opposition party.''
   Instead of making up his mind and convincing others to join him,
he prods others toward consensus and then hops aboard.
   ``The question mark about Foley is whether he's tough enough to
knock the heads when he has to, to make things happen,'' said
Norman Ornstein, congressional scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute, a conservative think tank.
   Some of Foley's fellow House Democrats say he has shown that
toughness.
   ``What happened in child care is pretty instructive of what's
going to happen the rest of the year,'' said Rep. Martin Frost,
D-Texas, a former ally of Wright who has become a deputy whip under
Foley.
   In the child care battle, Foley stood aside while Democratic
committee chairmen fought their own turf battles, then imposed a
deadline to force a resolution.
   Confident he had the votes, Foley and his leadership team used
the House rules to limit debate and thereby block any Republican
amendments. Once they decided on the final bill and made it public,
Democrats were able to win its passage within 48 hours.
   ``This was the first time I have seen Foley deliberately use the
muscle of the majority to drive something in an unfair way,'' said
House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., complains that Foley has brought a
return to ``back-room'' dealing in which it ``takes months for the
Democrats to decide what their own position is.''
   Edwards, chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, said that
struggling with Foley ``is like fighting cotton candy.''
   Foley's first months as speaker were otherwise without
significant accomplishment _ except for passage of a big pay raise
for Congress itself, done with the quiet agreement of Republicans.
   Although Democrats have a 258-176 majority, Foley was unable to
stop House passage of President Bush's proposed cut in the capital
gains tax last year.
   Foley also has been unable to forge a leadership position on a
Social Security payroll tax cut proposed by Sen. Daniel P.
Moynihan, D-N.Y. Similarly, he has declined suggestions that the
savings-and-loan bailout be made a partisan issue.
   ``Just heating this matter up when there is already some
misunderstanding about it may not be in the best public interest,
even though it might be somebody's view of a clever political
ploy,'' he said.

   Minutes after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir swept out of the Grand Hotel with his bodyguards in tow, a
robed Arab leader was whisked into the suite Shamir had just
vacated.
   It's a revolving door at the hotel, an oasis of opposites in
Washington's diplomatic and political whirl.
   Democrats hold fund-raisers there. Republicans, too. AT&amp;T stays
there, as does MCI.
   And for $2,500 a night, intransigent foes from the Middle East
also call the Grand home.
   You won't see Greta Garbo strolling languidly through the lobby,
as she did in the hotel's namesake movie. But on a recent March
morning, singer Janet Jackson went bouncing past the reception desk
trailed by an entourage laden with luggage.
   Jackson wasn't the only celebrity.
   Guillermo Ford, Panama's vice president, was holding court in
the lobby; Raphael Calderon, the president-elect of Costa Rica, was
on a pre-inaugural visit to Washington; and Morocco's top military
generals were in town.
   ``The lobby looked like a parking lot for bodyguards,'' said
Samir Darwich, the Lebanese-born, French-educated manager.
   Arabic and Spanish drowned out English.
   The presidential suite, where kings and presidents stay, is vast.
   A grand piano graces the living room, a jacuzzi dominates the
bathroom and the beds are truly king sized.
   Darwich says clients are drawn to the 260-room hotel by its
European elegance, multilingual staff and unobtrusive service. But
for some of his guests, security is the paramount consideration.
   ``We have proven we have the toughest, most sophisticated
security in town,'' he said.
   Plainclothes guards, their identity often unknown to the hotel
staff, mingle with the guests.
   It can get crowded, because visiting dignitaries also are
protected by the U.S. Secret Service.
   ``We tell our security to use their brain, not their muscles,''
Darwich said.
   There has never been a clash between the guests or the guards,
although a few close calls have pumped some adrenalin.
   There was the time former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
changed course and decided to shake hands with guests in the lobby
on his way out, rather than use the side door to leave the hotel.
   Several Arab officials were in the lobby and the security agents
were ``freaking out,'' said one witness.
   Several months ago, Israel's Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin was
coming to town and asked to stay at the Grand. Rabin was not
deterred after being told that a PLO official, Khaled al-Hassan,
also was staying there, a source said.
   If the Palestinian is concerned, let him move out, Rabin
reportedly said.
   In the end, al-Hassan stayed on the 5th floor, Rabin on the 9th.
   ``The hotel people did all they could to make sure they wouldn't
bump into each other,'' said the source.
   The hotel staff is used to unexpected events.
   On a Sunday evening two years ago, Darwich got a frantic call
from the State Department's protocol office: King Juan Carlos of
Spain was stranded in Washington during a refueling stop because of
mechanical trouble with his jet.
   ``We had 30 minutes to prepare to receive the king and his
entourage of 70 people. They were all hungry,'' Darwich said.
   The pianist became a busboy, one of the owners turned into a
waiter and Darwich carried suitcases.
   Darwich, a practicing Moslem, does not talk politics with his
guests. Nor do the Lebanese owners, whose chain includes four
hotels in Saudi Arabia and one in Switzerland.
   ``It's pure business for us,'' Darwich said.
   ``I don't care what nationality, religion, color or race, he is.
As long as a guest pays the bill, he's my boss.''

   Did the Americans play into Fidel Castro's hands
by starting TV broadcasts to Cuba, giving him a credible new
complaint about U.S. imperialism, or has jamming the telecasts
increased hostility among his people?
   Judging public opinion in a relatively closed country like Cuba
is a highly speculative undertaking.
   Cubans would like a more varied TV menu, but no one knows for
sure what they think of the Voice of America operation, known as TV
Marti. For that matter, estimates of support for the revolution
itself after 31 years differ wildly.
   Like Radio Marti, another Voice of America venture, TV Marti's
purpose is to provide balanced news and entertainment to a country
where the Bush administration says both are in short supply.
   There is broad disagreement about how many listeners Radio Marti
has after five years. One dissident described the audience as
``massive,'' but officials call it trifling.
   There are no reliable polls of public sentiment in Cuba. Some
people wonder whether Castro is as oblivious to the public mood as
were the Eastern European leaders ousted by popular uprisings last
year.
   Cuban officials insist they have mechanisms that ensure people
an opportunity to complain publicly without fear.
   In the Regla section of Havana last Monday, local leaders heard
dozens of complaints from hundreds of citizens.
   Gripes were aired about the transportation system and the uneven
distribution of goods to neighborhood stores. Similar meetings were
held this past week all over the island.
   How durable is the revolution? Can Castro make viable a system
that is being reviled in other places that tried it?
   A leader of the Young Communist League on Tuesday night
predicted, somewhat extravagantly, that his group would still be
functioning in 28,000 years.
   Two days later, a leader of a human rights group predicted, no
less extravagantly, that popular discontent resulting from economic
hardship will bring Castro down in less than a year.
   Whatever the truth, Castro is going all out to use the TV Marti
issue to rally support.
   There is little doubt many Cubans agree with him that the
broadcasts, which began March 27, violate national sovereignty.
   TV Marti, Castro says, is a ``gross instrument of subversion.''
Naming the station after the hero of Cuba's independence struggle,
he says, is like an American naming a house of prostitution for
George Washington.
   Boredom is a constant companion for many Cubans, however. They
are intensely curious about what kind of programming TV Marti would
bring and are disappointed by the successful jamming effort.
   The question is, how many are in each camp?
   The only known instance of a test, albeit limited, of public
sentiment occurred in an east Havana neighborhood a year ago. The
results were not encouraging for the government.
   A human rights activist, Roberto Bahamonde, ran for a municipal
assembly seat as a proponent of a free press, free speech and free
enterprise _ heretical views in Marxist Cuba.
   He lost 60-30, but there were 59 abstentions in the
show-of-hands vote. Presumably, many who abstained were closet
Bahamonde supporters who felt voting for him openly could lead to
charges of disloyalty.
   The establishment candidate, Gerardo Aldama, won slightly more
than 40 percent of the vote, virtually the same as President Daniel
Ortega of Nicaragua in his losing re-election campaign in February.
   Bahamonde was arrested two weeks after election night and won't
be free until July. The government says his detention is based on
participation in illegal meetings and on economic crimes rather
than his political stands.

   Police officers mingled among the lines of
spectators that crowded the Contemporary Arts Center for today's
public opening of the photographs of the late Robert Mapplethorpe.
   ``I've never seen crowds like this at an opening,'' center
spokeswoman Amy Bannister said.
   ``When people hear about censorship of art museums, they wonder
where it's going to stop,'' she said.
   Hamilton County authorities sparked controversy in recent days
by saying they think some of the photographs, which depict
homosexual and erotic themes, are criminally obscene. But despite
the police presence at the opening, no police action was
immediately taken against the show, which runs through May 26.
   A demonstrator at a museum entrance held up a sign reading
``Censorship is obscene.'' Because of the high number of expected
spectators, the show opened at 9 a.m., an hour earlier than
scheduled. No immediate attendance figures were available.
   Roger Ach, president of the center's board of trustees, said
public criticism would not change the museum's plans for choosing
future shows. Ach said he is encouraged by the public debate about
art and freedom of expression.
   ``I find myself being a conservative spokesman in a conservative
community,'' Ach said. ``But I believe in art expression and
freedom of expression.''
   Close to 6,000 people lined up Friday night and filed through
the museum to for an advance view of the exhibit in advance of
today's public opening. The exhibit includes nine homoerotic or
sadomasochistic photos among the 175 on display.
   ``This crowd says a lot about the people of Cincinnati and their
desire to express their freedoms,'' said museum director Dennis
Barrie. ``I think it is a vindication of the exhibit.''
   Earlier Friday, Hamilton County Municipal Judge Edward Donnellon
dismissed a lawsuit in which the private museum had sought a
summary judgment deeming the exhibit art, not obscenity.
   His ruling appeared to clear the way for prosecutors to step in.
   ``We can do a lot of things. I'm not going to tell you what
we're going to do,'' said Hamilton County Prosecutor Arthur Ney Jr.
``I can't discuss anything that I may, could, should or might do.''
   The controversy has revealed two sides of Cincinnati, a city
with a lively arts scene and a conservative law enforcement
establishment whose suppression of pornography is viewed favorably
by much of the population.
   It also revived the dispute over the Mapplethorpe exhibit,
canceled in June at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington,
D.C., but shown since in Philadelphia, Chicago, Hartford, Conn.,
Berkeley, Calif., and Boston.
   The exhibit of the work by Mapplethorpe, who died of AIDS in
March 1989, prompted Congress to limit funds for the arts after
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., declared the photographs obscene.
   Rallies in support of the museum were held all week at the
downtown plaza a block from the Arts Center.
   Anti-smut campaigners protested Friday outside Donnellon's
courtroom. One held a sign saying ``Jesus is freedom for captives
of pornography.'' Another declared: ``You can't disguise
pornography and get away with it in Cincinnati.''
   Although police were not in evidence at Friday's opening, fire
marshals were. They ordered the center to let patrons in only one
of the museum's three entrances, forcing people to stand outside up
to an hour in a block-long line.
   Members paid $10 apiece to help offset the loss of $300,000 the
Arts Center suffered because of the controversy over Mapplethorpe.
   The museum lost that money because directors withdrew from the
Fine Arts Fund, which sponsors and finances various groups in the
Cincinnati area, because they feared the community uproar over
Mapplethorpe would block contributions to all arts.
   ``A lot of people have joined just so they could be here
tonight,'' said Bob Swaney, the museum staffer who prepared the
Mapplethorpe exhibit. ``Our membership has risen by about 30
percent this week.
   ``One caller said, `I have no interest in seeing this show, but
the sheriff is making me buy a ticket.'''
   The crowd, including well-dressed older folk and arty types in
black turtlenecks, filed through the gallery until sometime after
midnight.
   Warning signs about controversial photos were posted at the
door, and no one under 18 was admitted.
   Barrie expressed concern about the show's future.
   ``The ruling today was not a setback,'' he said. ``But since the
matter's not in court, we don't know where it's at.''
   Last month, Sheriff Simon Leis Jr. declared the photographs
criminally obscene. Leis, as county prosecutor, successfully
prosecuted former Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt in the
1970s.
   He and other officials have closed all of the city's adult
bookstores, and bylaws make it illegal for video stores to rent
X-rated material.

   An animal-rights activist decried the removal
of a pig's heart that was flown on a passenger jet to a medical
conference in Florida.
   But the company that transported the heart said it was essential
for research that could bring down the cost of transplants by
determining if organs can be shipped on regularly scheduled
commercial flights rather than chartered planes.
   The heart was removed from a pig at Presbyterian-University
Hospital in Pittsburgh and connected to a pump still being
researched and tested by Organetics Ltd. of Minneapolis. The heart
was flown in a special container to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in a
seat aboard a USAir flight on Friday.
   Sandra Etzel, director of Animal Advocates of Pittsburgh, called
the action ``an absolutely abominable publicity stunt.''
   ``I think it's terrible they're going to kill a pig just to sell
a product,'' Etzel said. ``You are not helping to save anyone's
life by killing a pig to demonstrate a fact that you already know.''
   She said the device, which was to be displayed with the heart at
the 10th Annual International Society for Heart Transplantation
conference, has been written about in medical journals.
   A company official acknowledged several articles have been
written about the pump.
   ``But we've never put a heart on a plane,'' said Tom Jakubowski,
vice president of sales and marketing for the bio-medical
engineering company. ``This is our airborne test. It's just
continuing our research.''
   The pig heart reached its destination without incident.
In-flight tests indicated the heart did well during its journey,
and further tests will determine how well it fared while connected
to the pump, Jakubowski said today.
   The heart will then be disposed of following the conference, he
said.
   Human donor hearts currently are packed in ice and transported
on chartered planes, which costs $7,000 to $8,000. An organ shipped
that way must be transplanted within eight hours after it is
removed from the donor.
   Organetics hopes to show that its pump will sustain blood flow
in a heart for 12 to 15 hours, giving doctors time to send the
organ on a cheaper, commercial flight, Jakubowski said.
   ``It should impact the cost of organ procurement significantly
if we can get it to the state of using commerical airliners,''
Jakubowski said of the container. The cost of the container's
ticket for Friday's flight was $225.

   An eagle snatched a 2-year-old child
while its family picnicked near the Iranian city of Isfahan, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Saturday.
   The agency said the child was grabbed during a holiday outing
March 21-24 and an intensive search failed to find the youngster or
the eagle's nest.
   ``An eagle suddenly swooped down from the sky, took hold of the
kid's clothing in its talons and disappeared into the wilderness
before the bewildered eyes of the parents,'' the IRNA report said.
   The agency said details such as the sex of the child were
omitted from the story first reported by the Farsi language daily
Kayhan.

<TEXT>
   A Southeastern Trailways bus en route from
Tennessee to Indianapolis was fired at in Shelby County,
authorities said today. No one was injured.
   Sgt. Robert Cooley with the Indiana State Police said the
shooting occurred on Interstate 74 about 20 miles east of
Indianapolis at about 10 p.m. Friday.
   The driver of the bus, Terry Adams, 36, of Beech Grove, told
investigators he heard a blast as the bus went under an overpass at
Fairland.
   ``The shotgun pellets he thought hit the windshield,'' Cooley
said. ``Nobody was injured and the bus continued on to
Indianapolis.'' The windshield sustained minor damage, Cooley said.
   The bus had 25 passengers on board.
   The incident was the 28th violent act involving a passenger bus
since 6,300 drivers and 3,000 maintenance workers went on strike
against Greyhound Lines Inc. and its affiliates on March 1, said
George Gravley, a Greyhound spokesman in Dallas.
   Southeastern Trailways buses have driven on some Greyhound
routes since the strike began under a pool arrangement. A week ago,
a Southeastern Trailways driver was seriously wounded in the arm in
a shooting while driving a Greyhound route.
   Greyhound has offered $100,000 rewards leading to the arrests of
individuals who commit violent acts against the buses. Greyhound
has demanded one week of non-violence before its bargainers will
agree to resume negotiations.
   ``We won't be intimidated, and neither will our customers,''
Gravley said.
   The bus drivers' union has disavowed any involvement in the
violence, and cites incidents in which drivers have been injured. A
picket in Redding, Calif., was killed when he was struck by a bus
driven by a replacement driver; authorities ruled it was an
accident.
   Norma Largent, a dispatcher for the Indianapolis-based
Southeastern Trailways, said the incident was the first of its kind
in Indiana.
   ``It hasn't been occurring around here. Mostly it's been down
South,'' Ms. Largent said. ``I don't like this at all.''

<TEXT>
   Greek voters who cast their ship of state
adrift 10 months ago are being asked for a third time to finally
put someone at the helm.
   But Sunday's parliamentary election, like those last June and
November, could end without a clear winner and again leave Greece
with a weak coalition unable to cope with a foundering economy and
a resurgence of terrorism.
   The outcome may also have bearing on the country's four U.S.
military bases, which could be forced to close in November unless a
new agreement is reached with Washington.
   The conservative New Democracy party, which missed a majority by
about 1 percent of the vote last November, believes it can win
Sunday. The Socialists and Communists, neither strong enough to win
alone, hold out the hope of forging a leftist coalition.
   But after almost a year of indecision and near political
paralysis, opinion polls indicate the likely outcome is continued
deadlock and new elections. Prime Minister Xenophon Zolotas, 86, a
former governor of the Bank of Greece, remains caretaker until a
new government is chosen.
   New Democracy argues that Greeks must make hard choices for hard
times. The choice is simple, economic reform or economic ruin, says
71-year-old party leader Constantine Mitsotakis, who promises to
slash public spending and restructure the economy.
   ``This is what is at stake in these elections. Your wages and
pensions. The bread of your families,'' Mitsotakis told his final
campaign rally Friday night.
   However, his Socialist and Communist opponents describe his plan
as a blueprint for wholesale unemployment and severe cuts in
pensions and government services.
   If New Democracy needs to increase its vote total only slightly
Sunday it could win a majority in the 300-seat single house
Parliament and the right to govern Greece. First results are
expected late Sunday evening and final results Tuesday.
   New Democracy narrowly missed a majority both in November and in
June, when voters first rejected two-term Premier Andreas
Papandreou and his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK).
   But the charismatic Papandreou, also 71, continues to be a
political force despite his indictment on corruption charges,
open-heart surgery and an open affair with Dimitri Liani, a former
airline hostess half his age whom he married after divorcing his
American wife of 38 years. No date has been set for his trial.
   Papandreou's PASOK and a Communist-led alliance, which has
finished third in the last two elections, have worked together
seeking to prevent a conservative victory and to forge their own
leftist coalition.
   The European Economic Community has warned Greece that the
country is facing bankruptcy and that the Common Market will not
bail it out. Greek economists fear the country might be forced to
turn to the International Monetary Fund and institute tough
austerity measures in return for help.
   ``We need a government that can make decisions,'' said Paris
Kitsos, a political analyst for the independent Greek Foundation
for Defense and Foreign Policy. ``We need a government that won't
be short-term or incapacitated in any way.''
   The budget deficit has soared to $15.6 billion and the inflation
rate, the highest in the Common Market, touched 17.8 percent last
month. However, figures show wages have stayed ahead of inflation
and in Greece party loyalty often translates into jobs and loans.
   During 10 months of political deadlock, tensions have escalated
with traditional rivals Turkey and Albania. The country has seen a
dramatic rise in political violence.
   Leftist terrorists calling for an election boycott have set off
scores of bombs, which have caused some damage but no injuries.
Conservatives and Socialists have clashed, once with fatal
consequences.
   The weak and temporary coalitions formed after the last two
elections postponed decisions on the economy, on a U.S. extradition
request for a Palestinian wanted for the bombing of an airliner in
1982 over Hawaii and on a new military bases agreement with the
United States.
   Parliament has extended to Nov. 21 the deadline for the United
States to dismantle its military installations. The agreement
expired in December 1988 and the bases were to be closed by next
month. Two of the facilities have been slated for closure as a
cost-cutting move by the Pentagon.
   New Democracy says the bases and NATO membership are essential
for defense, while the Socialists say any future agreement should
be put to a referendum. The Communist-led alliance wants the bases
out of Greece and Greece out of the Atlantic military alliance.

   A 13-year-old boy, shot three times by an
eighth-grade classmate after a fight, was in good condition at a
hospital Saturday, officials said.
   Tito Carter was wounded once in the chest and twice in the arm
and while he waited in an assistant principal's office just before
3 p.m. Friday at Jefferson Middle School.
   Middle school director Phil Odom said Tito had been sent to
assistant principal Nedella Foster's office by a teacher. While in
the office, another 13-year-old eighth-grade pupil walked in
carrying a .38-caliber pistol.
   Foster ``stood up and tried to get the student not to do
anything,'' Odom said. But the student calmly raised the gun and
fired three shots at Tito before running from the building, Odom
said.
   The student fired one shot in the air as police Sgt. Max
Blumenthal arrived to begin his shift at the school, he said. Odom
said the pupil then pointed the gun at Blumenthal when the
policeman ordered him to stop.
   Blumenthal pulled his own gun and ordered the student to throw
down his weapon, which he did, Odom said.
   Capt. Charlie Owen, the police spokesman, said Blumenthal did
not shoot because there were other students in the line of fire.
   School district spokesman Michael Carrier said the victim and
the other boy ``had an altercation'' but he didn't know if the
shooting was gang-related.
   Tito was being treated at South Community Hospital, and the
other 13-year-old was being held in a detention center, officials
said. His name was not released because of his age.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese consumers and news media Saturday welcomed
their government's pledge to the United States to make structural
economic reforms that could fundamentally change this
work-obsessed, thrifty nation.
   But some Japanese bristled at the strong U.S. pressure behind
the reform program.
   ``Every Japanese citizen was hoping that the talks would force
Japan to change its structure,'' said housewife Noriko Kimura, 55,
of Yamato, a Tokyo suburb. ``There is no way around relying on
pressure from outside.''
   But the Mainichi Shimbun daily newspaper said in an editorial
that ``Japan compromised to appease U.S. demands.''
   On Thursday, Japan agreed to reforms that included simplifying
the national distribution system, increasing public works spending
on such things as roads and harbors and promoting shorter working
hours.
   The 32-page list of promises, which turned out to be more
comprehensive than many critics had expected, was also aimed at
altering the closed-door policies that Japanese businesses have
long employed to keep out foreign competition.
   The unprecendented agreement came Thursday after four rounds of
talks between U.S. and Japanese officials under the Structural
Impediments Initiative framework. The initiative was devised by the
Bush administration last July as a way to alter the underlying
economic factors that led to the United States' $49 billion trade
deficit with Japan in 1989.
   In return, the United States agreed to try to boost its
international competitiveness by trying to balance the federal
budget, improving the U.S. educational system and increasing
incentives for personal savings.
   ``I think it is a good thing if the United States gets Japanese
politicians moving and gets them to change old laws that are no
longer useful,'' said Kumiko Tsukamoto, a nurse at a large Tokyo
hospital. ``But telling us to raise public works expenses to 10
percent is going a bit far.''
   Toshiyuki Ogura, a 25-year-old employee of a British chemical
company, said he was ambivalent about the agreement.
   ``I think America is intervening too much in our affairs,'' he
said. ``But on the other hand, these talks are a good chance for
Japanese consumers.''
   Japanese leading economic daily, Nihon Keizai Shimbun said the
economic pressure was inevitable.
   ``As the international borders of economic activities get
blurred, intervention into internal matters to a certain extent and
changing rules are inevitable,'' the newspaper wrote in its
Saturday edition.
   ``It is wise for Japan to accept the U.S. intervention, although
it could be painful,'' the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Belgian Farmers Ordered to Kill 150,000 Pigs to Combat Swine
Plague</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government ordered farmers in areas
hit by swine plague to start destroying some 150,000 pigs Saturday
in an attempt to wipe out the epidemic.
   Farmers protested the preventive measure, arguing the refunds
for the loss will not cover the cost of restarting pig farming from
scratch, which could take years.
   The measure to destroy all pigs within a half-mile radius of the
29 plague dens discovered since March 15 affects some 200 pig
farms. Refunds for destroyed pigs will total about $16.9 million,
officials said.
   The European Community is expected to extend the measure later
this week by approving the killing of some 380,000 more pigs and
piglets in a wider area, costing about $46.5 million in refunds.
   Minister for Agriculture Paul De Keersmaeker said the swine
plague remains out of control in the northern Belgian provinces of
West and East Flanders. The plague was discovered Jan. 15, and
65,000 pigs have already been destroyed.

   A moderate earthquake rattled the San
Francisco Bay area during an exhibition baseball rematch between
the teams that were about to start a World Series game at
Candlestick Park when last year's killer quake struck.
   The temblor, measuring 4.5 on the Richter scale, capped an
afteroon-long swarm of seismic activity that jangled nerves and
tossed merchandise from store shelves but caused no major damage or
injuries.
   The quake struck at 7:39 p.m., just one minute after the game
between the Oakland Athletics and the San Francisco Giants got
under way at Candlestick.
   ``In the press box everybody sort of sat up and said, `No, that
didn't happen. Did someone jump hard?''' said Bob Egelko, an
Associated Press reporter covering the game. ``It looked like the
players hesitated.''
   It was a spooky reminder of the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that
struck Northern California on Oct. 17, killing 67 people and
causing an estimated $7 billion in damage.
   That quake shook Candlestick minutes before the start of Game 3
of the World Series between the Giants and A's before a crowd of
60,000. Some cracks appeared in the stadium, pieces of concrete
broke off, and power was knocked out, forcing a nationally
televised pre-game show off the air. The game was postponed and the
series resumed 10 days later.
   Many of the 23,760 fans at Friday's game seemed unaware of the
temblor, Egelko said. Giants' pitcher Russ Swan paused for a moment
on the mound before he resumed pitching. The A's went on to win the
game 9-2.
   The quake Friday evening was centered in the Danville area,
about 20 miles southeast of San Francisco, said Pat Jorgenson, a
spokeswoman for the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park.
   It was followed by a 3.5 temblor at 7:51 p.m., and a 3.1 at 7:59
p.m. The USGS recorded a total of 77 earthquakes in the Bay Area
between noon and 10:30 p.m. Friday, including shocks estimated at
3.9 and 3.5, Jorgenson said.
   She said this morning that while the detailed count of overnight
tremors was not immediately available, nothing significant was
reported between 10:30 p.m. Friday and 9 a.m. today.
   A Candlestick switchboard operator who felt an afternoon temblor
recalled, ``I thought `Oh my God, here we go again. The Giants and
the A's are playing and we're getting another earthquake.'''
   The quakes were felt over a wide area but damage was minimal,
said Chuck Young, a spokesman for the Office of Emergency Services
in Sacramento.
   ``We're sort of numb,'' said Mark Scollans, assistant manager of
Bill's Drugs in Danville, where crews had just finished picking
spilled merchandise off the floor when the evening quake struck.
   ``We're just getting rocked,'' Scollans said. ``It's all back on
the floor.''
   At a convenience store in nearby Alamo, cashier Mahmoud
Hiderzada said he'd lost count of the quakes and was ``waiting for
the next one.''
   ``Of course they scared me,'' he said. ``I was here by myself. I
jumped from behind the cash register and went outside. I took the
short way.''
   The temblors were centered about 9 miles south-southeast of
Concord, near Danville, probably on the Concord Fault, Jorgenson
said.
   April had been designated California Earthquake Preparedness
Month.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
Evey increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times
greater.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

   Nearly two years after residents pledged to clear
a local park of drug traffickers, it remains a drug-free oasis in
one of Houston's toughest neighborhoods.
   ``To me, it's kind of like sacred ground,'' said police Sgt.
Richard Zajac, who heads a unit of undercover drug officers. ``They
(drug dealers) don't trespass on it. But everything around there is
fair game.''
   The cleanup of Winzer Park, once called ``Crack in the Box''
because it was so easy to drive up and buy drugs there, has been
hailed by federal drug czar William Bennett and President Bush as
an example of community-police cooperation. Both visited the park
in December.
   Police started the cleanup in November 1987, gradually
overcoming the distrust of neighborhood residents to enlist them in
the campaign.
   Teacher Thelma LaStrap, 49, joined up after seeing a TV news
report that portrayed her Acres Homes neighborhood as a pocket of
drug abuse.
   ``I thought, `They don't have drugs in this neighborhood.' So I
got in the car and drove around the park,' recalled Mrs. LaStrap,
now secretary of the group known as Acres Homes War on Drugs. ``As
I looked at groups of young black men, some yelled out my name,
`Hi, Mrs. LaStrap.'
   ``See, I taught out here for years and they knew me. That was
depressing. People were drinking and exchanging packets of drugs
and money, but nobody was using the facilities.''
   Capt. David Massey, who heads the police substation that
oversees the area, said that before the cleanup, ``good people in
the community hadn't been able to use the park in five years.''
   Today, teen-agers play basketball in the park, which covers
roughly 10 square blocks, until nearly midnight. Officers use the
park's baseball diamond to practice after their 11 p.m. shift ends.
On weekends, families barbecue and push their children on swings.
And the park has been renamed for Andrew Winzer, a police officer
from the neighborhood who spent time with kids at the park and was
killed in a car accident while on duty.
   ``They ain't been selling no more dope,'' said Richard Gould,
14, a student at Aldine Junior High and a regular at the basketball
court. ``It's kind of chilled out on all that.''
   ``The bottom line is they've cleaned it up,'' Zajac said. ``We
haven't made a case there since I've been here _ that's a year and
three months.''
   But the victory against drugs remains limited to the park.
   Since the beginning of the year, undercover officers have made
five felony drug busts within three blocks of Winzer Park.
   A barbecue joint a few blocks away and a liquor store in the
opposite direction are hang-outs for middle-aged men who drink from
bottles wrapped in paper bags and allegedly deal crack day and
night _ sometimes as early as 5 a.m. to people en route to work,
Zajac said.
   Bloodstains on the basketball court are testament to continued
troubles in the neighborhood. Ballplayers said the stains appeared
after a drug suspect shot another at the liquor store and the
wounded man ran home through the park, dripping blood.
   ``Even though the park is still very active, I won't say that
we've totally cleaned up all the drugs,'' said Sharon Pouncey, one
of four officers assigned to a ``storefront'' police squad in the
neighborhood. ``We still have spots, but we're working on them.''
   The storefront officers work with the Acres Homes group to
provide tips on drug activity and form friendships. The
organization's membership fluctuates between 200 to 300 with an
active core of 15 to 20 people, said storefront Officer Vergil
Ratliffe.
   ``I remember the first year we got out here,'' Ms. Pouncey said.
``This is the largest black area in the city and they were really
reluctant to join the police. We had to go out and instill that
trust.
   ``At first, the only time they saw officers was for arrests and
shakedowns. Now that they've implemented the neighborhood police
approach, it's been a lot different. They know us and they tell us
what's happening.''

   Former national security adviser John
Poindexter was convicted today at his Iran-Contra cover-up trial of
all five felony charges against him in the scandal that rocked the
last two years of the Reagan administration.
   The jury delivered the verdict on one count of conspiracy, two
counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of lying to Congress.
   The former national security adviser is the highest-ranking
Reagan administration official to be put on trial in the
Iran-Contra scandal. The former president testified on videotape.
   Poindexter, 53, faces up to 25 years in prison and fines of
$1.25 million. U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene scheduled
sentencing for June 11.
   Poindexter made no comment, but his attorney, Richard Beckler
said the verdict would be appealed. ``We're going to keep fighting
it as long as we can.''
   Prosecutor Dan Webb said the trial team led by Lawrence Walsh
would make a recommendation on punishment within the next several
weeks. So far, none of the Iran-Contra figures convicted has drawn
a jail sentence.
   In the courtroom, Poindexter stood grimly, facing the jurors as
25-year-old foreman Wayne Mitchell read the verdicts.
   ``Guilty,'' Mitchell said as the clerk read each of the five
criminal charges aloud.
   There was silence in the courtroom as the first verdict was
returned and then a murmur as Mitchell continued to read guilty
verdicts on each of the five counts.
   He joins former aide Oliver North and another Reagan
administration national security adviser, Robert McFarlane, as
officials who stand convicted in Iran-Contra.
   The charges stem from efforts by officials in the Reagan
administration to sell weapons to Iran and divert some of the
proceeds to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua at a time when Congress
had banned such aid. Poindexter was charged with destroying
documents and obstructing efforts by members of Congress to learn
details of the affair.
   ``There's no question that even being charitable to Admiral
Poindexter, he did it because he wanted to protect the political
viability of Ronald Reagan. And I consider that to be a selfish
motive,'' Webb said outside the courtroom.
   Asked about Reagan's sworn deposition in which the president
said he felt no crimes had been committed in Iran-Contra, Webb said
simply, ``President Reagan was wrong and incorrect,'' noting the
earlier conviction of Poindexter's former aide North.
   The White House said President Bush would have no comment on the
verdict.
   Poindexter was found guilty of charges he concealed from the
House and Senate intelligence committees the U.S. role in a
November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   The jury also found him guilty of concealing from the House
North's military assistance to the Contra rebels fighting the
leftist government of Nicaragua.
   The former national security adviser did not take the witness
stand in his own defense during the five week trial. Jury
deliberations took six days.
   Reagan said in his videotaped testimony that he didn't think
Poindexter had made any false statements to Congress.
   Reagan said he had instructed his aides to stay within the law
in assisting the Contras. Poindexter's lawyers asserted that he was
following Reagan's instructions at all times.
   North delivered damaging testimony against his former boss.
   The former White House aide testified that he was reluctant to
go to a meeting with members of Congress about the Contras because
he knew there would be things he could not disclose.
   North said he expressed his concerns to Poindexter, who sent his
subordinate to the meeting anyway.
   North testified that Poindexter told him ``you can handle it''
or ``you can take care of it.''
   Once there, North lied repeatedly, telling House intelligence
committee members he wasn't offering military advice to the rebel
force.
   North also testified that he watched Poindexter tear up a
politically embarrassing presidential document that ratified a Nov.
25, 1985, shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran. The document, called a
finding, portrayed U.S. involvement in an arrangement to trade arms
for hostages.
   Poindexter tore up the document Nov. 21, 1986, hours after
telling Congress that Reagan hadn't approved the Hawk missile
shipment.
   In fact, Poindexter had presented the document to Reagan, who
signed it Dec. 5, 1985. Reagan said in his videotaped testimony he
couldn't recall when he learned of the Hawks shipment and didn't
recall the finding.
   Poindexter's lawyers countered by emphasizing other aspects of
North's testimony.
   ``Nobody ever told me to lie to Congress,'' North said of his
statements about the Contras. North insisted that the decision to
cover up was his own, not Poindexter's.
   North at one point started to testify that he might have gotten
the conversation with Poindexter backward. North said it may have
been he, rather than Poindexter, who gave assurances that North
could ``handle'' or ``take care of'' the House intelligence
committee.
   Greene cut off North's revised testimony, saying the subject had
already been covered in detail the day before.
   On the Hawks shipment, Poindexter was accused of lying to
Congress when he said he didn't find out about the delivery until
five weeks after it occurred and that he hadn't realized other U.S.
officials might have known about the shipment ahead of time.
   Prosecutors suggested that Poindexter lied so that Congress
wouldn't start inquiring about the presidential document.
   The document stated that ``munitions'' could be provided to the
``Government of Iran,'' which was ``taking steps to facilitate the
release of the American hostages.''
   Poindexter tore up the document eight days after Reagan told the
nation that ``we did not ... trade weapons ... for hostages.''
   Poindexter's defense was that by Nov. 21, 1986, he had only a
dim memory of the year-earlier Hawks shipment.
   He told Congress he would try to find out details and report
back.
   Beckler didn't deny that Poindexter had known of the shipment
earlier than January 1986, but excused it as a misstatement due to
bad memory.
   Poindexter ``supposedly found out'' at the end of November about
the Hawks shipment rather than in January and ``that is no big deal
... that is a five-week mistake,'' Beckler told the jury.
``Considering all he had to do, it's not too bad that he only
missed by five weeks.''

   A West Virginia Wesleyan College
fraternity that displayed the Confederate flag despite a campus
moratorium on use of such symbols has been disciplined, school
officials said.
   President Thomas B. Courtice on Thursday ordered 45-member Kappa
Alpha to stop recruiting pledges for six months and said the
fraternity's current pledges cannot become active members.
   The penalty came after an incident in which fraternity members
clad in Confederate garb wore 2-inch rebel flags on their hats as
part of ``Old South'' weekend, the fraternity's annual spring
dance, said Dusty Williams, alumni adviser to the group. More than
a dozen black students later protested outside the fraternity's
off-campus house, Williams said.
   Courtice instituted the moratorium last December after students
and parents complained about the use of Confederate symbols.
   ``I think the punishment was quite severe, and the members feel
the same,'' said Williams, a 1969 Wesleyan graduate. ``We don't see
why the pledge class has been targeted.''
   In addition to the sanctions, Kappa Alpha was ordered to
complete a workshop on cultural diversity and sensitivity.

   America's newspaper editors, who always worry
whether there's a future for the newspaper, last week examined what
the future newspaper might look like.
   The editors are concerned because millions of people find
reading the paper is no longer a daily routine. Circulation has not
kept pace with population growth.
   ``Our readers are older, and every time we print an obituary, we
may be losing a reader,'' says Ray Jenkins, editorial page editor
of the Baltimore Evening Sun.
   Analyst Leo Bogart, author of Press and Public, says that while
the number of U.S. households increased by 41 percent between 1970
and 1987, daily newspaper circulation increased by less than 1
percent.
   Many people read the paper only a day or two a week, studies
show. Some take it on days grocery store coupons appear, some only
on Sunday.
   Editor Dave Zweifel of The Capital Times in Madison, Wis., said
sales of his paper from news racks are up while home delivery is
down.
   ``That means people are stopping by the newsstand when they feel
they need a paper,'' Zweifel said. ``Our readers are telling us
we're not considered necessary.''
   Women particularly have been abandoning newspapers.
   The number of women who read the paper four days out of five has
diminished by 26 percent in five years, one study says.
   ``We wondered how and whether we could engage a bright, young
population that increasingly saw newspapers as old-fashioned,'' the
Future of Newspapers Committee said in a report to the American
Society of Newspaper Editors.
   Jenkins says such worries may themselves be old fashioned.
   He thinks the era of ``the printed and delivered newspaper'' is
drawing to a close because of the convenience _ well-known to young
people _ of being able to fish information out of a home computer.
   He cites, too, the environmental impact of publishing a
newspaper.
   ``One day, the public is going to say to us, `You can't cut down
1,000 acres of trees to deliver one Sunday paper any more,'''
Jenkins said.
   His is a maverick viewpoint, he admits. Members of the editors'
society still seemed optimistic that the newspaper would survive _
by finding ways to become more useful.
   They examined prototype newspapers produced by the Future of
Newspapers Committee. Another ambitious study is under way to
examine ``the occasional and at-risk reader.''
   The prototypes suggested what the paper might be in 30 years:
full of color; full of graphs and charts; highly compartmentalized,
organized, indexed, with pages labeled and stories color-coded so
readers would know at a glance what's in the package.
   These papers would be designed to be utilitarian, perhaps even
customized so that subscribers would have the option of taking only
the sections they want.
   They looked like less of a random conglomeration of isolated
reports on the last 24 hours and more like a groomed, selected
package of information.
   Restaurant critics would rate rest rooms as well as cuisine.
Some stories would be told entirely in pictures or sketches.
   The newspaper might also publish a thin, quickly read summary
edition, to be sold at supermarket checkout counters to people who
don't take the regular paper because it is too ``heavy'' _ in both
senses of that word.
   Committee member Bill Southerland, executive editor of the
Republican and American of Waterbury, Conn., said he drew
encouragement from the editors' newly aroused interest in readers.
   He said he expects people will depend on news on paper, rather
than computer screens, ``for the foreseeable future.''
   ``They want to scan for the pleasant surprise _ the story they
do not know to ask (a computer) for,'' he said.
   But even Southerland talks of his wife's ``time poverty'' and
concedes his three children don't find the newspaper vital.
   ``They are aware of what's in the paper,'' he said, ``when I
call it to their attention.''
   Some editors thought the concern about the vanishing newspaper
was silly.
   ``We're finding a lot of older people are getting back to
reading; they're fed up on television,'' said Harvey Jacobs, editor
of The Indianapolis News, who said he grew up in a house in which
there were two items on the table: ``the holy Bible and the evening
news.''
   ``I'm bullish on the industry,'' added Ted Beitchman, editor of
the Tribune-Democrat of Johnstown, Pa., for the past year. ``In any
small town, the newspaper is just so important to the culture of
the whole town.''
   He said when he dropped a cartoon panel of Pennsylvania history
he got 117 postcards in protest. When he wrote a pro-choice
editorial on abortion, he found 67 pickets outside the paper's
front door.
   He didn't relish the protests, he says _ but he sure liked
knowing what his paper said mattered so much to his townspeople.

<TEXT>
   A Chinese rocket lifted a U.S.-made
telecommunications satellite into space Saturday, marking the
nation's debut in the international satellite launching business.
   Applause broke out in the launch control room as the flaming
tail of the Long March 3 rocket disappeared into the nighttime
skies over the Xichang Satellite Center in southwest China's
Sichuan province.
   The launch was broadcast live on television for the first time
in China's 20-year-old satellite program. Chinese Central
Television said Premier Li Peng watched the launch from a control
center in Beijing.
   Attending the launch were about 400 invited guests from around
the world, including many from satellite maker Hughes Aircraft Co.,
and U.S. Ambassador James Lilley.
   The rocket lifted into orbit an AsiaSat telecommunications
satellite, which is owned by the Asia Satellite Telecommunications
Co. Ltd., a Hong Kong-based consortium with Chinese, British and
Hong Kong partners.
   The satellite will be used to transmit television, telephone and
other communications signals to Asian countries. Burma and two Hong
Kong companies have signed contracts to use it and other countries
have signed letters of intent.
   ``I hope that tonight's launch is the beginning of a long-term
Chinese-American collaboration in space and is the basis of a
continued improvement in the relationship between the peoples of
our two countries,'' an official from Hughes Aircraft said. He was
not further identified.
   China hopes the successful sendoff of the 2,750-pound AsiaSat
will help improve its image as a backward country and attract other
customers who face long waits for satellite launches.
   ``Most foreigners, and Chinese citizens too, think of China as
the land of the bicycle,'' the official China Daily newspaper
wrote. ``They may have to adjust that image.''
   China has launched 26 of its own satellites.
   The launch of the AsiaSat was almost blocked by a U.S. weapons
ban imposed after Chinese troops crushed a pro-democracy
demonstration in Beijing, killing at least 500 people.
   But in a conciliatory and controversial move, President Bush
waived the ban for AsiaSat and two other Hughes satellites that
China will launch for an Australian company in 1991 and 1992.
   The AsiaSat satellite is on its second trip into space. It was
launched in 1984 as the Westar-6 but failed to reach its proper
orbit. It was recovered by the U.S. space shuttle and then sold to
the Asia Satellite Telecommunications Co.
   It is estimated to have a 10-year lifespan.
   After the launch, an official from Asia Satellite announced that
the company would donate the use of six of the satellite's 24
transponders to Asian broadcasters covering the Asian Games in
Beijing this September.
   The launch is a major breakthrough for China, which has been
trying for several years to enter the world launch market.
   Western nations have expressed concern that advanced technology
could be leaked to China during satellite launches, while Western
space technology companies have complained that China's launch
price of $30 million is artificially kept lower than the fees
charged by the European Ariane consortium or the space shuttle.
   In 1988, China signed an agreement with the United States

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Prosecutor's Office
has opened an investigation into the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of
Czechoslovakia that crushed a pro-democracy movement, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
   The probe will clarify all circumstances of a ``criminal offense
against peace'' and identify Czechoslovaks responsible for the
Soviet-led invasion, the daily newspaper, Slobodne Slovo, said. The
names of officials who invited the five Warsaw Pact armies into
Czechoslovakia in August 1968 will be made public.
   ``To identify those people is the main aim of the
investigation,'' the daily quoted Lubomir Veleta, deputy general
prosecutor, as saying. He said the people questioned will include
Vasil Bilak, a former Communist Party high-ranking official who
resigned all his political posts in December.
   Bilak, 72, a longtime party ideologist, was accused by
Czechoslovak human rights activists in a report sent to authorities
in May 1988 of treason for allegedly helping to prepare the 1968
invasion.
   Bilak, who retired to his home in Bratislava, has often been
rumored to be one of a handful of Prague Communist leaders who
asked the Soviet Union to intervene to halt the reform movement.
   On Aug. 20-21, 1968, 600,000 troops from the Soviet Union,
Poland, Bulgaria, East Germany and Hungary crushed the ``Prague
Spring'' campaign that was considered by Moscow a ``heresy'' and a
``threat to socialism.''
   Last year, pro-democracy movements swept hard-line Communist
governments from power in Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European
countries after Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev made it clear
the Red Army would not intervene.

   President Bush may have won the battle when
the Senate confirmed T. Timothy Ryan Jr. as top savings and loan
regulator, but Democrats also gained.
   Ryan, a labor lawyer with no banking experience, was confirmed
on a 62-37 vote as director of the Treasury Department's Office of
Thrift Supervision. He's expected to be sworn into office Monday.
   The administration lobbied hard for that result. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady worked the phone for days. White House
lobbyist Tom Korologos roamed the halls of Congress. Ryan himself
met with dozens of senators, some as late as Wednesday morning, the
day of the vote.
   The hard work paid off in a wider-than-predicted victory.
Seventeen Democrats joined all 45 Republicans in endorsing Ryan.
That left 37 Democrats opposed.
   Democrats acknowledged from the outset that the battle was lost.
Yet, for six hours leading to the vote, they railed against Ryan as
unqualified for the job and at the administration for even thinking
about sending his name. Why?
   In part because that's what they believed. But Senate Republican
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas offered an alternate explanation. The
Democrats, he said, just created an opportunity to say ``I told you
so'' to the president if Ryan doesn't work out.
   ``I have a sneaking suspicion that much of this debate is not
really about Tim Ryan,'' Dole said. ``It may be an exercise in
political self-protection, and it may be about writing the opening
chapter in who is really to blame for the savings and loan mess.''
   The S&amp;L crisis was years in the making and the blame definitely
rests on both parties and on both the legislative and executive
branches of government. But Democrats are frustrated that the mess
has left President Bush, and Ronald Reagan before him, politically
unscathed.
   This is especially distressing because of the ethics
investigation of four Democratic senators and one Republican who
received $1.3 million in campaign contributions from Charles H.
Keating, the man at the center of the nation's worst thrift failure.
   During his eight years in office, Reagan never mentioned the
developing problem. Bush has barely touched on the subject since
signing the bailout law eight months ago.
   ``Though the Congress is unquestionably the one that is writing
the laws ... this needs to be shared as well by the president,''
said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.``In terms of the amount of money we
are allocating to this bailout, President Bush deserves to be known
as the savings and loan president, not the education president, not
the clean air president.''
   Slowly but surely that's happening. Bush has had to put the
administration solidly behind Ryan, who will have the thankless job
of deciding which S&amp;Ls are strong enough to survive and which must
surrender to government control.
   Bush also will be confronting the dilemma of finding more money
for the problem. On Friday, a report from congressional auditors
made it clear the need for more dollars will be soon.
   Charles A. Bowsher, comptroller general of the General
Accounting Office, increased the agency's estimate of the crisis'
cost from $257 billion to at least $325 billion. He said it could
easily top $400 billion and may hit $500 billion in the economy
falters.
   Bush's 1991 budget, through various budget gimmickry, earmarks
only $7.3 billion for S&amp;Ls. Recognizing reality as described by the
GAO means Bush's budget deficit projection would have to zoom.
   ``The administration ... seems to have felt the job was done the
day the bill was signed. Actually the job just began,'' said Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House Banking Committee.

   Students waiting for the school bus in this
Detroit suburb no longer have to languish outside or maintain a
vigil by the front window. They can listen for a beep that doesn't
come from a horn.
   The Novi Community School District began installing electronic
transmitters in its buses Friday. For $25 a year plus deposit,
families can rent a receiver that sounds off when the bus comes
within two miles.
   Novi is the first school district in Michigan, and among the
first in the country, to offer the Here Comes the Bus system, its
inventor said.
   ``It gives folks a sense of control,'' said P. David Vincent of
Northville, whose company distributes the receivers to Optimist
clubs that in turn rent them to students.
   Vincent said he didn't know how many Novi families had rented
receivers, but he had a likely candidate in 12-year-old Mary Beth
Redoutey.
   ``It just keeps you from waiting half your life at the bus stop,
freezing,'' she said. ``You could be doing the rest of your
homework while you wait instead of going out there.''

   Twelve-year-old Jody Mackey doesn't have
to run away from home to join the circus in the Soviet Union. She
and her parents have been invited for a free trip.
   The Soviet circus Bim Bom, which is in Wheeling preparing for a
two-year tour of the United States, made the offer after Jody, a
sixth-grader, gave a dove-shaped pendant to the daughter of circus
performers.
   Jody awarded the pendant to Latifa Tourdieva, the 10-year-old
daughter of two acrobats in the Moscow-based circus, as part of a
public reception at the Wheeling Civic Center.
   ``I gave her a dove of peace, because our countries shouldn't be
fighting,'' Mackey said. ``We should all be together as friends.''
   ``I'm very surprised,'' Jody said of her trip. ``I'm happy,
though _ and excited.''
   Alexander Bondarev, the artistic director of the circus, said
Jody will travel back to the Soviet Union with the circus when its
performers take a break in December.

<HEAD>Ann Arbor's Liberal Voice On Abortion In Contrast With Rest of
State</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDY DAUBENMIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This university town, voting to declare
itself a ``Zone of Reproductive Freedom'' to preserve abortion
rights, still echoes with the voices of 1960s liberalism.
   ``Just Say No to Capitalism'' is typical of the occasional
graffiti on Main Street. Aging Volkswagen buses painted with
flowers are at home on the streets.
   Utility poles are studded with staples used to tack up leaflets
for the latest cause. ``Please save Black Pond Woods'' begs one
notice, with the reminder, ``Please recycle this paper.''
   On Monday, voters approved 2-to-1 a measure that would limit the
penalty for abortion to $5. The charter provision, modeled after
the city's $5 marijuana ordinance, takes effect only if a state or
federal law bans abortion.
   Kim Lane Scheppele, an assistant professor of political science
at Michigan, calls the abortion measure ``the municipal equivalent
of civil disobedience.''
   The provision, which backers believe is unlike any other in the
nation, attracted no organized opposition and its passage surprised
no one. Yet the voters also approved raising the marijuana fine
from $5 to $25.
   Critics of the abortion measure point out that, like the
marijuana fine, it is largely symbolic. The Michigan Court of
Appeals ruled in 1977 that communities may not enforce a city
provision in place of state law.
   Scheppele, who teaches a seminar on abortion at Michigan, said a
conservative strain exists alongside the city's liberalism,
pointing out that it has a Republican mayor. But she said
politicians shouldn't dismiss the vote as a symbol of frustrated
liberalism in a university town.
   ``It does show there is at least some constituency in Michigan
that is going to be very upset if restrictive abortion measures are
ever passed,'' she said.
   Ann Arbor elects pro-choice lawmakers but they are a minority in
the Legislature, which has supported a ban on state-funded
abortions and requiring minors to have parental consent for an
abortion.
   The city of 108,000 showed its pro-choice leanings in 1988 when
the issue of banning state-funded abortions for poor women was on
the ballot. It passed easily statewide but lost in Ann Arbor.
   Some chafe at the city's liberal image; others shrug it off.
   ``It's a university town and university towns always do unusual
things,'' former Mayor Robert J. Harris said.
   ``It's going to perpetuate that liberal stereotype. It's trying
to perpetuate the image that Ann Arbor is above state law, that
somehow it has placed itself higher than state law,'' complained
senior Mark Tullki, a member of the Conservative Coalition ticket
in the university's student elections.
   Paul Stebleton, a sophomore from Maine who is pro-choice, said
it was the abortion opponents who are a vocal minority imposing
their will on others. ``It's the rest of the country that is out of
step with what people really want.''
   Stebleton said politicians shouldn't ignore the Ann Arbor vote.
``I would hope they see us as the future and do take us
seriously,'' he said. ``The way we vote indicates the course of
events for the future.''
   Dan Calderone, a bearded baker with long hair tied back in a red
bandanna, said Ann Arbor voters may not be out of step with the
times, just more thoughtful.
   ``Voters are very sophisticated. They understand the issues very
deeply and are not afraid to voice their opinions and take somewhat
unpopular stands,'' he said.
   Calderone is pro-choice, but didn't vote in Monday's election.
``I haven't voted since Richard Nixon won in 1972,'' he said. ``I
was disillusioned with the whole American political system.''

<HEAD>Chernobyl Cleanup Victims to Get New Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviets who helped clean up the world's worst
nuclear accident will get free vacations, extra medical care and a
whole array of other benefits, Pravda reported Saturday.
   More than 100 radiation victims who were denied proper hospital
care because of a drug and bed shortage began a hunger strike in
the Ukraine last month to demand better treatment, the Tass news
agency reported a week ago.
   Beginning this summer, people who worked within 20 miles of the
Chernobyl atomic power plant after its 1986 explosion and fire will
get lowered rents.
   They will also be placed at the front of waiting lists for
hospitals and better apartments.
   Tass said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev asked the Soviet Trade
Union Council to ensure that children from contaminated areas spend
their summer vacations in medical centers and rest homes
nationwide. He told governments to make spaces for these children
before May 1, and ordered that one sanitarium normally used for
government officials be turned over to the children.
   The moves appeared to answer the hunger strikers' main demands.
   The Soviet government also plans to organize an additional
medical checkup this year for all the cleanup workers and keep them
under closer medical supervision in general.
   The April 26, 1986, fire and explosion at the Chernobyl plant,
located in the Kiev region of the Ukraine, killed at least 31
people. Radioactive contamination affected millions of acres of
land, and tens of thousands of people were relocated because of the
poisoned environment.
   The weekly Moscow News reported in November that more than 250
people who were working at the plant or helped clean up afterward
have died.
   People affected by radiation will be registered on a single list
and, beginning this year, special rehabilitation centers will be
created for them, Pravda said.
   A Soviet lawmaker and environmentalist, Yuri Shcherbak, said
Thursday in Geneva that he believed it would take $320 billion to
cope with all the consequences of the Chernobyl accident over the
next 10 years.
   The Ukrainian Parliament has designated April 26 as ``Chernobyl
Tragedy Day,''and the body voted last month to phase the station
out of operation over the coming years.

<TEXT>
   The State Department has expelled an Iraqi
diplomat at the United Nations because of his suspected role in an
alleged murder plot against two opponents of the Baghdad regime.
   The diplomat, who was not identified, was ousted for ``an abuse
of his privileges of residence in the United States,'' a department
spokeswoman, Anita Stockman, said Saturday. She said the diplomat
left on Thursday.
   ``Given the nature of the diplomat's actions, it would be
inappropriate for the government of Iraq to take any retaliatory
action,'' the spokeswoman said.
   She said the department could not provide no more specific
information except to confirm that the expulsion was linked to an
investigation in California.
   ``We cannot comment on that case since it is currently under
investigation,'' she said.
   But a U.S. official, asking not to be named, said the diplomat
helped plan the alleged plot.
   A federal grand jury in Sacramento on Friday indicted a former
employee of the mission for allegedly participating in an Iraqi
plot to kill two foes of the Iraqi government in the United States.
   Andri Khoshaba, 47, of the central California city of Modesto,
was indicted on two counts of interstate travel to further the
alleged murder-for-hire plot. Khoshaba is a former employee of
Iraq's mission to the United Nations.
   U.S. Attorney David Levi said Khoshaba, an Iraqi-American, was
promised $50,000 for his role in the plot, which the FBI disrupted
by detaining him briefly.
   A spokesman for Iraq's U.N. mission in New York said Friday he
had no knowledge of Khoshaba's recent activities.
   Levi refused to identify the targets of the plot, but said they
were not part of any country's mission to the United Nations and
that they were not U.S. officials.
   ``They were people opposing the Iraqi regime in this country,''
he said. ``One of the targets was living in the United States.''
   The Modesto Bee reported that the targets of the assassination
plot were Sargon Dadesho, a leader of the Assyrian community in
California's Central Valley, and an unidentified Kurdish leader,
whose photograph Khoshaba was carrying when he was detained by the
FBI. The Bee got its information from Dadesho and unnamed sources
close to the investigation.
   A federal warrant has been issued for Khoshaba's arrest, Levi
said. He remains at large.
   A spokesman for the Iraqis' U.N. mission who would not give his
name said Khoshaba ``was working with the former permanent
representative at his residence as a janitor.''
   ``His job was terminated one year ago and from that time we
don't know anything about him,'' the spokesman said.
   Levi said Khoshaba worked as a driver.
   The U.S. attorney said Khoshaba traveled to New York City twice
this year to meet with an Iraqi government agent. He returned to
Modesto after each trip, Levi said.

<HEAD>Southeastern Trailways Bus Damaged, Possibly By Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Southeastern Trailways bus was damaged by
objects thrown or fired from an interstate overpass, in the latest
violent incident since Greyhound drivers and maintenance workers
went on strike five weeks ago.
   None of the 25 passengers or two drivers on the bus was injured
in the incident at 10 p.m. Friday on Interstate 74 at Fairland,
about 20 miles east of Indianapolis.
   Greyhound Lines Inc. claims there have been 26 incidents of
shooting at buses, not counting Friday's incident, since 6,300
drivers and 3,000 maintenance workers went on strike against
Greyhound and its affiliates on March 1.
   Greyhound spokesman Steve Scarpino said the Southeastern
Trailways bus had no connection to Greyhound. ``Greyhound did not
have a driver on that bus, it was not our bus and it was not our
(route),'' he said.
   Though Indianapolis-based Southeastern Trailways is a separate
company from Greyhound, some of its buses travel Greyhound routes
under a cooperative arrangement. Unlike Friday's incident, the two
other attacks reported on Southeastern Trailways buses since the
strike began, including one March 31 in which a driver was
seriously wounded, occurred while those buses were going on
Greyhound routes.
   State police Sgt. Robert Cooley said Friday's incident was being
investigated as a possible shooting. ``The driver went under an
overpass and he heard a blast, and the shotgun pellets, he thought,
hit the windshield,'' Cooley said.
   But the bus company said a senior driver on the bus, who was
training the man at the wheel, thought there was no sign of
shooting. ``The impact would appear to be from rocks, ball bearings
or some other similar objects,'' said dispatcher Norma Largent.
   Ms. Largent said the windshield and destination sign glass on
the bus were broken in 11 places, all the size of a silver dollar.
   Greyhound has offered $100,000 rewards leading to the arrests of
people who fire on its buses. Scarpino said the company had not yet
decided whether to offer the reward in the case of Friday's
incident.
   ``We've got to know exactly what the facts are, before we make
other decisions,'' he said.
   Greyhound has demanded one week of non-violence before its
bargainers will agree to resume negotiations.
   ``We won't be intimidated, and neither will our customers,''
Gravley said.
   Jeff Nelson, a spokesman for the Amalgamated Council of
Greyhound Local Unions, said the incident was unfortunate, but he
criticized Greyhound's stance that negotiations will not resume
until violence has stopped.
   ``We believe that that's a shame that the company is allowing a
few crackpots around the country to determine whether or not they
will finally come to the negotiating table,'' he said.
   The bus drivers' union has disavowed any involvement in the
violence, and cites incidents in which drivers have been injured. A
picket in Redding, Calif., was killed when he was crushed by a bus
driven by a replacement driver. Authorities ruled it an accident.

   Gospel-pop singer Amy Grant is suing
Marvel Comics to stop the use of what she says is her likeness on a
comic book that features ``occult subject matter.''
   She charges a photograph from her 1986 album ``Amy Grant _ The
Collection'' was copied for the cover of the March 15 issue of
``Dr. Strange Sorcerer Supreme.'' She filed a lawsuit Friday in
U.S. District Court here.
   ``You'll see it's the spitting image,'' said her attorney, Mark
Patterson.
   Patterson said he'll ask for an injunction to stop distribution
of that issue and will probably seek monetary damages.
   Telephone calls to Marvel Entertainment Group's headquarters in
New York City were unanswered Saturday.
   The lawsuit charges that ``Dr. Strange'' features characters,
story lines and artwork related to witchcraft, sorcery, science
fiction and other fantasy, horror and occult subject matter.
   ``Many fans of Christian music consider interest in witchcraft
and the occult to be antithetical to their Christian beliefs and to
the message of Christian music in general,'' the lawsuit said.
   Ms. Grant won country recorded song of the year at the 21st
Annual Gospel Music Association Dove Awards on Thursday on for

before making it to Broadway just wasn't good enough.
   ``Jake's Women'' was scheduled to move to Broadway's Neil Simon
Theater at the end of this month after a short run here. The first

years in prison for trying to murder Toto, a former pizza shop
owner from Allentown.
   He said he is angry that the Totos seem to be capitalizing on
the crimes.
   ``Frances is going on talk shows now. She sits there and laughs.
This has ruined my life,'' said Bruno.
   Bruno said he became involved with the Totos' daughter,
Elizabeth, in 1982. He also grew close to Mrs. Toto, looking on her
as a mother figure.
   After another boyfriend of Elizabeth failed three times to kill
Toto, Bruno was enlisted.
   On the morning of Jan. 26, 1983, Bruno placed a .25-caliber
automatic handgun to the back of Toto's head as he slept and
squeezed the trigger. Toto still carries the slug in the back of
his skull.
   ``I'm definitely a different person,'' Bruno said. ``I've
matured a lot.''
   ``After spending 5{ years in prison, you realize things aren't a
joke,'' he said.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Arms Control Key at Summit with Bush</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-Soviet, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Saturday the
success of his summit this spring with President Bush will depend
on whether arms control agreements are reached.
   Gorbachev made the remarks after Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze wound up three days of meetings Friday with U.S.
officials in Washington to prepare for the May 30 summit.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Shevardnadze acted to
lower expectations that Bush and Gorbachev will be able to sign a
treaty sharply reducing intercontinental nuclear weapons.
   Gorbachev said in an interview with the Tass news agency
released Saturday that the main task of the summit, to be held in
Washington, will be to reach agreement on disarmament and arms
reduction. ``On this depends, mainly, the success of the
meetings,'' Gorbachev said.
   He did not elaborate.
   Baker told reporters he and Shevardnadze failed to resolve
differences over air-launched and sea-launched cruise missiles, two
obstacles for agreement on a Strategic Arms Reduction treaty.
   Shevardnadze also acknowledged ``certain difficulties, certain
problems'' in concluding a strategic arms treaty.
   Gorbachev told Tass the unification of Germany will also be
discussed at the summit, saying this step must be taken ``in a
constructive vein, without any damage to anybody.''
   Baker said Moscow had dropped its insistence that a reunified
Germany be neutral but both he and Shevardnadze made clear that
sharp disagreement remains over U.S. insistence that a unified
German nation retain West Germany's membership in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.

   Government MIG fighter planes killed 12
civilians and wounded 45 others in a bombing raid on the Red Sea
port of Massawa, Ethiopian rebels said Saturday.
   Friday's raid was the second attack on the port by Soviet-built
jet fighters in three days, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front
said in a report sent to The Associated Press in Nairobi.
   The rebels previously reported aerial attacks on Massawa and the
town of Afabet on Tuesday and Wednesday. They said 46 civilians
were killed and 82 wounded in those raids.
   The reports could not be confirmed independently and the
government has not mentioned any air raids. But a handful of
reporters allowed into Eritrea in recent weeks have reported
previous air and artillery attacks on Massawa.
   In all three attacks last week, the rebels said, the air force
targeted civilian centers with cluster and demolition bombs.
   Israel has been accused of supplying the government of President
Mengistu Haile Mariam with cluster bombs, a charge denied by both
Ethiopia and Israel.
   A cluster bomb contains dozens of smaller bomblets that hurl
shrapnel over a wide area. They are particularly effective against
massed troop formations.
   Massawa is one of only two ports on Ethiopia's Red Sea coast. It
was captured by the rebels on Feb. 11, three days after they
launched a new offensive across much of Ethiopia's northernmost
province.

<TEXT>
   Here are the main issues and party
positions in Greece's national elections Sunday:
   ECONOMY: Greece has an inflation rate of about 17.8 percent and
an estimated budget deficit of $15.6 billion. The conservative New
Democracy wants to slash public spending, streamline the public
sector, minimize state interference and attract private investment.
The Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) wants to improve public
sector production but not cut spending. The Coalition of the Left
and Progress promises tax reform, public spending reform and
measures to protect the buying power of wages.
   DEFENSE: New Democracy regards NATO membership and the four U.S.
military bases in Greece as crucial for Greece's defense. PASOK
says Greece should not blindly follow NATO policies and says any
future defense agreement with the United States should be put to a
referendum. The Coalition wants to close the U.S. bases and pull
Greece out of NATO.
   ELECTORAL LAW: All parties seek changes in the election law to
strengthen their own positions. New Democracy wants to make it
easier to win a majority with less than 50 percent of the vote.
PASOK and the Coalition want to require a party to get more than 50
percent of the vote to win a majority in Parliament. Under the
current law, a party can win a majority in Parliament with 47
percent to 48 percent of the vote.
   EDUCATION: All parties propose stricter standards and better
teacher training. New Democracy also favors the introduction of
private universities, an idea opposed by PASOK and the Coalition.

<HEAD>Denver Chemist Wins Clean Air Victory</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It took scarcely a minute amid the hubbub of a
late afternoon House committee meeting to insert the unassuming
amendment into the clean air bill.
   It meant the world to a bearded, slightly offbeat chemist at the
University of Denver 1,600 miles away.
   But in the days that followed, it would bring chills to some
environmentalists, local air pollution control officials and the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   The provision, now part of the massive and complex clean air
bill approved last week by the Energy and Commerce Committee, calls
on states to require as part of pollution control plans in scores
of cities use of a portable automobile pollution detection device
similar to a radar gun that pinpoints speeders.
   The requirement is not in a Senate version of the bill, which
passed 89-11 last week. It's not known if the amendment will
survive future congressional action.
   The mobile pollution sensor is the invention of chemistry
professor Donald Stedman, who has been working on the project for
14 years and has had a prototype ready since early 1987.
   Until now, few people have been seriously interested in the
sensor.
   ``It's been a terrific struggle. We've been going from month to
month ... to keep my group together,'' he said in an interview.
``Anytime I'm not teaching, I'm telling people about this.''
   One of those who learned of Stedman's device was Rep. Joe
Barton, R-Texas, who sponsored the amendment requiring the devices
as part of air pollution cleanup programs.
   Barton called it a ``common-sense solution'' and a
``cost-effective way to identify the worst polluting automobiles.''
   Known as a friend of oil interests, Barton sees the device as a
better way to combat air pollution _ by getting the dirtiest cars
off the road _ than in requiring clean fuels, including
alternatives to gasoline, or tougher exhaust controls.
   Stedman also has done little to ingratiate himself with Denver
area pollution control officials _ as he admits _ by arguing his
invention would be a much better way to combat smog than the
mandatory testing and oxygenated fuels program now in use in the
area.
   Denver is among the most pollution-plagued cities in the nation.
   Stedman said as many as several thousand of the devices _
costing about $50,000 apiece _ might eventually be in use.
   To test vehicles adequately, a city such as Denver would require
five of the mobile sensors, a state such as Illinois about 20 and
``in California you're talking between 50 and 100,'' he says.
   None of the sensors has been produced commercially, although
Stedman said several companies have become interested. He and the
university, which holds the patent, would get percentages.
   But Barton's amendment has not been received enthusiastically
everywhere.
   The day after it was approved, the EPA sent a memo to all its
regional offices saying that while Stedman's invention ``may have
some merit'' and is being evaluated ``much work needs to be done
before remote sensing is a viable tool'' in air pollution control.
   Richard Wilson, director of the EPA's Office of Mobile Sources,
expressed concern to Barton that use of the devices was being made
mandatory, arguing such a move was premature considering the
unanswered questions surrounding use of the device.
   Among the concerns are that the device _ for the time being,
anyway _ is capable of detecting only carbon monoxide emissions and
not other chemicals that contribute significantly to smog.
   Emission results also could change significantly depending on
where the sensor is located and how a vehicle is being driven,
making enforcement of violations difficult, critics maintain.
   ``This hasn't been tested and it's premature to make it a
mandatory requirement in the Clean Air Act,'' said Bill Becker, the
Washington representative for state air pollution control officials.
   The Coalition for Safer, Cleaner Vehicles, a Washington-based
consumer and environmental group, also raised concerns about making
such devices mandatory, saying it brings up questions of fairness
and due process.
   ``It seems very unfair to test someone at a random stop where
they may be pressing on the gas pedal hard or their car might be
cold and not quite warmed up,'' said Gary Huggins, the group's
executive director.
   Stedman insists those problems can be worked out. During a
recent visit to Washington to demonstrate his device, he was
ecstatic about the lift given his longtime project by the Barton
amendment.
   The two men had not known each other previously. Barton learned
of Stedman's sensor from a letter the professor had published in
the Wall Street Journal.
   After the requirement was put into the clean air legislation,
``interest suddenly jumped,'' Stedman said. ``Two very nice
gentlemen in two very nice suits from a fairly large company came
to visit me (the next day), saying we'd really like to talk to you
about this.''

<TEXT>
   While progress on cutting nuclear weapons is
slow _ too slow probably to sign an accord at the summit in late
May _ the United States and Soviet Union are beginning to lay the
groundwork for a future Europe free of Cold War tensions.
   The tempo is being set by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
whose concept of a single Europe would supersede the nose-to-nose
confrontation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
Warsaw Pact, and it picked up speed at the latest round of
U.S.-Soviet talks here.
   While President Bush is in no mood to scuttle NATO, and, in
fact, insists on membership for a unified Germany, he has accepted
the idea of a 35-nation European summit meeting later in the year
where proposals for Europe's future would be exchanged. For months,
the President has proclaimed his vision for ``Europe whole and
free.''
   Bush's approval of a 35-nation summit this year depends on
having a treaty to reduce troops, tanks and other non-nuclear
weapons in shape to sign at the gathering. And that is nearly as
much in doubt as completing a framework for a strategic missile
reduction accord for Bush and Gorbachev to sign at their Washington
summit beginning May 30.
   But Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in three-days of
talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, showed
interest in constructing new arrangements, with new missions for
NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Back in December, in a speech in Berlin,
he called for a ``new architecture'' after 40 years of Cold War.
   Before wrapping up three days of talks in Washington last week,
Shevardnadze offered some suggestions.
   They included setting up an all-European council and a
risk-reduction center. The council members would be the heads of
the 35 nations, including the United States and Canada, that signed
the 1975 Helsinki agreement to reduce East-West tensions. They
would meet annually, and their foreign ministers more frequently,
to discuss security problems.
   Baker, in December, proposed keeping NATO in business but giving
it some new assigments, such as overseeing troop reductions and
refereeing conflicts in other regions. He said on Friday he was
open to new ideas, provided NATO stays in business.
   Since the process is new, the ideas are just now taking shape.
But they are bound to multiply if East and West keep moving closer
together.
   Baker and Shevardnadze managed to take a cooperative approach in
their talks despite tensions in the Baltics between the Kremlin and
independence-minded Lithuanians, Latvians and Estonians.
   A blow-up could send the drive for a new Europe into reverse.
``Of course I would be disturbed if I thought conflict might
erupt,'' Bush said at a windup news conference Friday.
   But otherwise he will go to the Soviet Union for another round
with Shevardnadze in mid-May that produce ideas for a new Europe
even as they grope for a framework for a strategic weapons
reduction treaty.
   The two sides failed in the Washington talks to overcome several
obstacles to a nuclear accord. Among the problems are the limits to
be imposed on cruise missiles and devising a formula to monitor
weapons reductions.
   ``Taking into account it is in seven weeks,'' Yuri Nazarkin, the
Soviet chief strategic arms negotiator, said Thursday of the
summit, ``it is impractical to expect it is going to be signed.''
   Already, U.S. and Soviet officials are considering the
possibility of a second Bush-Gorbachev summit later in the year to
sign the treaty if it is ready by then.
   On a new look for Europe, however, the picture is brighter.
   Shevardnadze withdrew the long-standing Soviet demand that
Germany, once it is reunified, be neutral. That helped the
discussion, even though Baker continued to insist that the merged
country be a member of NATO.
   Shevardnadze rejected the U.S. demand as unacceptable. He
recalled how Germany overran its neighbors, including the Soviet
Union, in World War II.
   But he said: ``I have no doubt that in the time remaining it is
possible to find mutual acceptable solutions.''
   The Bush administration considers German membership in NATO the
best insurance against aggression by Germany again. Shevardnadze
said his government is seeking a solution to this ``very acute and
very difficult question.''
   However the problem is resolved, a united Germany would be at
the center of the new Europe. American troops on the continent
would be limited to 225,000, and the Soviets could have only a
maximum of 195,000 outside its borders.

   A man was arrested Saturday on murder and
attempted murder charges, accused of spiking Coca-Cola with an
outlawed rat poison that killed a neighbor and crippled two
children in 1988, authorities said.
   George Trepal, 41, was arrested without incident at his Sebring
home and charged with one count of murder, six counts of attempted
murder and several product tampering charges.
   The FBI said the October 1988 poisonings of the Carr family of
Alturas was the nation's only known case of deliberate thallium
poisoning.
   Trepal was a neighbor of the Carrs when family members ingested
the outlawed rat killer from an eight-pack of 16-ounce soda bottles
at their home, said Lynne Breidenbach, a Polk County sheriff's
spokeswoman.
   ``There was a definite motive, but we're not at liberty to
discuss it because the investigation is in its infancy,'' she said.
She added that the arrest was based on a sealed grand jury
indictment returned Thursday.
   Peggy Carr, 41, was placed on life support and died March 3,
1989. Her son Duane Dubberly, 16, and stepson Travis Carr, 16, were
left paralyzed by the poison.
   Mrs. Carr's husband, Parearlyn Carr, and three others also
absorbed traces of the chemical but did not become ill. Carr,
contacted Saturday by The Associated Press, said he had no comment
on the arrest.
   Trepal also was charged with seven counts of poisoning food or
water and one count of tampering with a consumer product. He was
held in the Polk County Jail without bond.
   Health investigators determined within six weeks of the
poisoning that a deliberate act of tampering was involved and ruled
out the Tampa bottling plant and the soda distribution system as
the source of the thallium sulfate, which has been banned for
general use since 1965.
   Tests performed by the FBI on three unopened bottles showed the
crimped metal caps had been removed and replaced, and traces of the
toxic pesticide were found inside.
   Based on the amount of thallium found in the residue in the
empty bottles, a state epidemiologist estimated each bottle
contained about a half gram of thallium. One gram is considered a
fatal dose for humans.
   Thallium sulfate can be found in the form of a crystal powder or
a paste which dissolves in water.
   Investigators from the FBI, Food and Drug Administration, Polk
County sheriff's office and state attorney's office were involved
in the case.

<HEAD>ANC-Government Set Date For Talks; 20 Killed in Fighting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government and the African
National Congress announced Saturday that they would open
discussions on May 2, despite continued black factional fighting
that had earlier postponed their talks.
   The latest violence reports said two babies were among 20 people
killed as blacks battled one another and police.
   The government-ANC talks, scheduled for May 2-4 in Cape Town,
were announced by the government and by the ANC's exile
headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia. The discussions are to deal with
obstacles in the way of formal constitutional negotiations to end
apartheid and white minority rule.
   The negotiations replace April 11 talks that the ANC postponed
to protest the police shooting of black demonstrators, which left
at least 11 dead on March 26 in Sebokeng, south of Johannesburg.
   After the ANC talks, President F.W. de Klerk will go to Europe,
where he will meet French President Francois Mitterrand on May 10,
the Elysee Palace in Paris announced Saturday. Hubert Vedrine, a
Mitterrand spokesman, said de Klerk will be the first South African
president Mitterrand has met with. De Klerk is also scheduled to
visit Britain, West Germany and Switzerland, Vedrine said.
   The South African president's office made no comment on his
travel plans.
   Mandela, the 71-year-old deputy president of the ANC, will meet
with the organization's executive leadership in Lusaka from Sunday
through Tuesday, officials in Lusaka said. He also planned to
attend an April 16 rock 'n' roll concert in his honor in London.
   The ANC announced that Mandela and his family have moved into a
mansion built in the black township of Soweto by his wife, Winnie,
during his 27-year imprisonment. Soweto residents criticized Mrs.
Mandela when the large house was built on a hill in 1987 with
proceeds from the sale of her biography.
   She never moved in, and Mandela associates said he had sent word
from prison he would prefer to live in the small brick house he had
rented since the 1940s. Mandela has lived in the small house since
he was freed Feb. 11 from his life prison term for plotting
sabotage and the overthrow of the government.
   ANC Secretary-General Alfred Nzo made no reference to the
controversy about the mansion when he announced the move. He
attributed it to the organizational obligations and personal
requirements of Mandela and the rest of his family.
   In their daily unrest report for the preceding 24 hours, police
said Saturday they had fired shotguns at a crowd in Kokosi township
southwest of Johannesburg after firebombs and stones were thrown at
a police vehicle, injuring one policeman in the face.
   Police said ``a 32-year-old woman was wounded, and regrettably,
a child which she had been carrying was fatally injured'' by the
gunfire.
   In Natal province, where supporters of the ANC have been
battling members of the Zulu-based Inkatha movement, the police
report said 19 more people had been killed, raising the death toll
to at least 86 in less than two weeks.
   The police said 14 people _ a baby, three women and 10 men _ had
been killed since Friday morning, and five bodies were found
Thursday by the KwaZulu homeland police, which are led by Inkatha
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   The police said gasoline bombs and guns were used to attack a
house in the township of Mpumalanga, resulting in the death of a
woman and her baby.
   Police reported that officers and soldiers were fired upon with
automatic weapons while separating clashing black groups at
Mpumalanga. Police said there were running battles among rival
groups, 70 homes were burned, and that police did not know how many
people may have been killed or wounded when the security forces
fired their rifles, tear-gas canisters and rubber bullets.
   Police have been accused of favoring Inkatha in the fighting.
   De Klerk last week ordered extra police units and soldiers into
northern Natal to halt the political feuding, slayings, clashes,
ambushes and looting that have killed about 4,000 people since 1986.

   The countdown began Saturday for
space shuttle Discovery and its launch of the $1.5 billion Hubble
Space Telescope, the observatory astronomers hope will solve some
basic mysteries of space and time.
   Countdown for Tuesday's liftoff began on time at 3 p.m. EDT, an
hour after the five astronauts arrived.
   ``It's been a long time happening, and now it's really here,''
said Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver. ``This
is the end of a fairly long wait. ... But I think in the case of
this payload, the Hubble Space Telescope, it's well worth the
wait.''
   ``We're very, very anxious to get it up there and get it into
operation,'' mission specialist Bruce McCandless II told a small
crowd of reporters, photographers and astronaut family members.
   Air Force spokesman Ken Warren said forecasters expected a 90
percent chance of favorable weather for a Tuesday launch, with a 10
percent chance of strong surface winds that could delay the launch.
   After arriving from Johnson Space Center in Houston, the
astronauts were driven to the launch pad to view the Hubble Space
Telescope, which they are to deploy on the second day of the
five-day mission. It is the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever
built by NASA and has endured seven years of delay because of
technical problems and the 1986 Challenger explosion.
   The space agency finished charging the telescope's
nickel-hydrogen batteries Saturday afternoon. Technicians then
began a final sweep of the shuttle's payload bay, removing the
battery chargers and any remaining protective coverings. The
payload bay doors were to be closed early Sunday.
   Technicians also repaired a shuttle engine cable and replaced a
damaged connector that was discovered late Friday.
   Because the telescope's nickel-hydrogen batteries must be
recharged in a week, NASA plans to halt launch attempts for eight
days if Discovery does not lift off by Friday. The batteries will
power the telescope from the time it is disconnected from the
shuttle's power system during deployment until its two
energy-collecting solar panels take over in space.
   NASA has up to six hours to launch Discovery starting from 8:47
a.m. Tuesday. But the space agency limits the crew's time in an
orbiter before launch to slightly more than five hours to prevent
fatigue, so that the ``launch window'' would be shorter if a
problem developed after the crew went into the shuttle.
   It is the longest period of opportunity for launch since the
1986 Challenger mission, said Terry Willingham, NASA test director.
``We want to give ourselves every opportunity to get this launch
off in the first few days,'' Willingham said.
   The telescope, once deployed, is to orbit 380 miles above Earth
for 15 years. It will be capable of detecting objects 50 times
fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best
ground-based observatory.
   Astronomers expect to study stars and galaxies so distant that
their light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years.
   In addition to Shriver and McCandless, the crew includes Marine
Col. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the pilot, and mission specialists
Steven A. Hawley and Kathryn Sullivan.

<HEAD>Finance Ministers Worry About Falling Yen, Agree to Watch</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and the world's six other leading
industrial powers expressed worry Saturday about the steep slide of
the Japanese yen and its impact on the global economy.
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and other finance chiefs
wrapped up daylong talks at the French Finance Ministry by pledging
to keep developments in the exchange markets under review.
   However, no major action was announced to support the yen.
   The ministers ``reaffirmed their commitment to economic policy
coordination, including cooperation in exchange markets,'' the
ministers said in a final statement.
   The officials of the Group of Seven nations _ Britain, Canada,
France, West Germany, Italy and Japan in addition to the United
States _ met against the backdrop of turmoil in the Japanese
financial markets.
   In recent weeks, the dollar soared to a three-year high against
the yen, although it firmed in the last few days on uncertainty
about the outcome of the finance ministers' meeting.
   A stronger dollar threatens to worsen the United States' already
large trade deficit with Japan. It makes Japanese imports less
expensive for American consumers and U.S. products more expensive
for foreign buyers.
   Japanese officials had sought help from their economic partners
in strengthening the yen against the dollar.
   After the meeting, Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan
said the Group of Seven countries would like to see a stronger yen.
``There is no country which said the yen's (recent) levels
accurately reflect Japan's economic fundamentals,'' he said.
   Hashimoto and Yasushi Mieno, Japan's central bank president,
expressed confidence they had pledges from the other nations to
keep the currency from slipping further. ``We didn't do this to let
the yen fall,'' Hashimoto said of the ministers' statement.
   ``I don't want to indicate to you that means there were promises
made,'' Brady said.
   He said the yen was trading at about 154 to the dollar three
years ago and ended last week at about 157 to the dollar. ``So
that's more stable than one could have thought,'' he said.
   To help bolster the yen, governments can intervene in the
financial markets by selling dollars to buy the Japanese unit. The
nations' central banks earlier in the year intervened heavily to
try to brake the rise in the dollar.
   Asked if more invention is planned to bolster the yen, Finance
Minister Theo Waigel of West Germany replied, ``You know what
happened in the past; I can't say anymore.''
   He said the group's official communique ``recognizes that
coordination and cooperation will continue, and nothing more can be
added.''
   The statement said the ministers talked about ``developments in
global financial markets, especially the decline of the yen against
other currencies, and its undesirable consequences for the global
adjustment process, and agreed to keep these developments under
review.''
   The nations also said, ``Overall growth remains good, with
strong investment providing a major stimulus to their economies
(and) inflation remains contained.''
   They urged, however, ``continued vigilance'' of inflation rates.
   John Major, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, said there
was ``no express pressure'' for increases in interest rates and
``no great concern'' about inflationary prospects in the seven
nations.
   Governments raise interest rates to dampen consumer demand and
ease inflationary pressures.
   The ministers also discussed West Germany's plans to create an
economic and monetary union with East Germany this summer. They
said the merger ``could contribute to improved global growth.''
   They also welcomed the economic reforms under way in Eastern
European countries from central planning to free-market systems.
   This was the first formal meeting of year of the Group of Seven
officials. They will gather again next month in Washington.

<HEAD>Rear Seat Shoulder Belts Save Lives, But Could Be Costly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Owners of older model cars who want to add
rear-seat shoulder straps will find that the safety modification
can be expensive.
   Kits including shoulder belts cost from $50 to $150 and
installation could run from $125 to $250 or more, manufacturers and
dealers say.
   Attention was drawn last week to the limitations of having only
lap belts in the rear seats of automobiles when Ford Motor Co.
agreed to pay $6 million to a California couple.
   Ford is paying the record amount to Jim and Patricia Miller of
San Diego, Calif. One of their 11-year-old twin sons died in a 1988
head-on collision and the other was paralyzed. Both were secured in
the back seat of a 1986 Ford Escort by lap-only belts.
   The car company has not acknowledged that the lack of shoulder
belts figured in the high-speed, head-on collision, but the
no-shoulder-belt issue is the basis for a growing number of
lawsuits against auto manufacturers.
   National Highway Traffic Safety Administration spokesman Tim
Hurd said the likelihood of a rear-seat passenger being killed in
an accident is reduced by 31 percent with a lap belt and 42 percent
with a lap and shoulder belt.
   Cars beginning with the 1990 model are required to have
rear-seat shoulder restraints, and the requirement will be extended
to minivans in 1992.
   But auto safety advocates say only a few thousand of the 120
million pre-1990 models have the additional protection.
   ``It's like the labors of Hercules to get a rear-seat shoulder
belt system installed,'' said Clarence Ditlow, head of the
non-profit Center for Auto Safety.
   Ditlow said that with an increase in lawsuits and with
out-of-court settlements soaring into the millions of dollars,
manufacturers ought to push the retrofit systems and make them
cheaper.
   The center has been campaigning for years to get automakers to
issue recalls for shoulder strap additions _ something that could
cost manufacturers hundreds of millions of dollars.
   European cars have had shoulder belts in four seats for years,
but most Japanese cars have no better record than U.S. vehicles,
said Ditlow.
   Checks with several Washington area auto dealers on installation
of a set of rear-seat shoulder restraints in an older car brought a
variety of responses.
   One mechanic said he didn't think they were available at all.
Quotes on installation charges ranged up to $270 for a set. The
cost of the belts themselves ranged up to $78 each.
   One dealer said it would take a week to 10 days to get a set on
order. Another said, ``I wouldn't even begin to tell you how much
it would cost without seeing the car.''
   Any car built since 1972 was required by law to contain special
anchors for the rear shoulder belts, but it has taken the
government 18 years since then to require the belts themselves on
new models.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has strongly advocated
their installation in front and rear seats since it investigated
200 crashes in 1986 and concluded that lap-only belts were not only
insufficient but sometimes hazardous.
   The board recommended that manufacturers provide retrofit
assemblies to convert lap-only belts to lap-shoulder systems and
make ``installation of them as simple and inexpensive as possible.''
   Ford, Chrysler and General Motors all have now established what
the board considers acceptable programs for making the shoulder
belts available, said board spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz.
   Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston said it plans to have the straps
in its minivans a year ahead of the 1992 requirement and retrofits
are available for most older models. One drawback is that they only
come in black, while regular seat belts usually match the car's
interior.
   GM spokesman John Anderson said the company makes 90 different
retrofit kits for over 50 models.
   The company, however, has supplied NTSB with a list of 16 models
for which kits are not available. For some models, GM said its
engineers concluded that a lap-only belt is safer because a
shoulder belt would provide no additional protection and could
cause the occupant to slide under the lap belt. Last December, the
safety board accepted the company's conclusions.
   The safety board and the Transportation Department have asked
automakers to provide customers with information on belts for
individual cars.

<HEAD>Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa Favored in Peru's Presidential
Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONTE HAYES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa appeared to be the
front-runner in Sunday's presidential election, but another
political neophyte may force him into a runoff in this country
plagued by rebel attacks and soaring inflation.
   Besieged by a savage, decade-long leftist insurgency and
impoverished by hyperinflation running at 2,000 percent annually,
Peruvians have grown distrustful of politicians' promises of easy
solutions.
   The country's 10 million voters are to elect a new congress and
choose a successor to populist President Alan Garcia, who is
ineligible for re-election to a consecutive five-year term.
   Leftist rebels have launched numerous attacks aimed at scaring
voters away from the polls and have threatened more action Sunday.
The country's 80,000-man police force and army units are on alert
to protect voters and candidates against attacks by the Maoist
Shining Path guerrillas.
   Six candidates for congress were assassinated across Peru in
recent weeks. More than 18,000 people have been killed as a result
of the 10-year-old insurgency, the governnment says. Half the
country is under emergency rule because of the rebels.
   Public opinion polls indicate support for Vargas Llosa has been
dropping fast in recent weeks as voters have begun to see him as
just another politician.
   Vargas Llosa, 54, running on a free-market platform, is still
the leading presidential contender in the field of nine candidates.
But an 11th-hour surge by political newcomer Alberto Fujimori, the
son of Japanese immigrants, has dimmed Vargas Llosa's chances for a
first-round victory.
   Fujimori, 51, was a political unknown as recently as a month
ago. His meteoric rise in the past two weeks has stunned political
analysts and public opinion survey firms.
   Polls open at 8 a.m. EDT and close at 3 p.m. Voting is required
by law. Unofficial results are expected Sunday night, but official
returns will not be available for weeks.
   As late as February voter support for Vargas Llosa was above 50
percent, sufficient to avoid a runoff. But analysts say an
aggressive campaign by the ruling left-of-center Aprista Party has
created fear in voters about the social cost of the severe
austerity measures Vargas Llosa proposes.
   Vargas Llosa, despite being a political independent, also has
been tainted by the support he has received in his two-year
campaign from traditional politicians discredited in past
governments, pollsters say.
   Surveys made as recently as a week ago show Vargas Llosa falling
to around 35 percent of voter support. Fujimori, an agricultural
engineer running on an independent ticket, has leaped into second
place with 24 percent of voter preference.
   If Vargas Llosa falls short of a majority, he will be forced
into a runoff, most likely in early June.
   And if his vote total is significantly less than 50 percent, his
center-right Democratic Front coalition also could fall short of
majority control in the 60-seat senate and the 180-seat chamber of
deputies.
   That would make it difficult for him to impose the radical
reforms he is seeking.
   ``We have been observing a tendency, first in Lima and then in
the provinces, that is so strong that it has disconcerted
pollsters,'' said Manuel Saavedra, director of the Peruvian Company
for Market Research.
   Analysts say Fujimori's success is a reflection of the
alienation of Peruvian voters, who feel loyalty to no party and are
looking for miraculous, painless solutions to the country's crisis.
   ``Peruvians are in search of a savior,'' said Manuel Torrado,
president of Datum, a market research firm.
   In the closing days of his campaign, Vargas Llosa responded to
the attacks against him by his opponents. The heaviest criticism
came from the Aprista Party's candidate, Luis Alva Castro, 48, who
was favored to win a runoff spot against the novelist until
Fujimori's last-minute surge.
   In his last television appearance Friday night before a midnight
ban on campaigning, the novelist accused the Garcia government of
using all its resources to ``deceive humble people about what I
desire for Peru.''
   ``They say, for example, that I defend the rich and that if I
reach the presidency, I will forget the poor. That is not true, my
fellow countrymen. I don't owe anything to the rich of this
country.''
   ``I have left literature and entered politics because I believe
that through freedom this country can be changed so that people ..
. are assured work and food.''
   Vargas Llosa is seeking a strong mandate from the electorate to
put into practice an economic shock program. His program includes
removal of price controls, reduction in import restrictions, sale
of money-losing state enterprises and elimination of tens of
thousands of jobs from the bloated bureaucracy.
   Vargas Llosa, best-known as the author of ``Aunt Julia and the
``Scriptwriter'' among other novels, entered the political arena in
1987 after organizing a huge demonstration against Garcia's plan to
nationalize the banks.

<HEAD>Three Dead, Curfew in Katmandu After Bloodiest Riots in a Century</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIJAY JOSHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers shot and killed three people and
imposed an indefinite curfew on Katmandu Saturday after the
bloodiest riots in more than a century in this Himalayan kingdom.
   It was reportedly the first time that a curfew has been imposed
in Nepal.
   The government said 10 people were killed and 107 injured during
Friday's demonstration, but witnesses said 300 people may have been
killed when police opened fire on 200,000 pro-democracy protesters.
   Police shot at the demonstrators, who are demanding a multiparty
system, after they set government buildings afire, put up burning
barricades and then marched toward the palace.
   ``It was one of the worst killings ever since the Kot
massacre,'' said Devendra Raj Panday, a human rights activist.
   He was referring to an 1846 battle between feuding members of
the royal household in which at least 55 nobles and scores of
soldiers were killed.
   Witnesses said at least three people were shot to death early
Saturday. Radio Nepal said troops had orders to shoot curfew
violators on sight.
   Troops shot and killed two women in the Katmandu suburb of
Patan, witnesses said. One was fatally wounded while walking to a
Hindu temple to pray and another was shot as she looked out of the
window of her house, a witness said.
   A third body was seen lying in the street, witnesses said.
   ``The Nepalese people are illiterate. They don't know what a
curfew is. The woman was going to the worship she goes to daily,''
said the witness, who refused to be identified.
   Chief government spokesman Radhey Shyam Bista said police opened
fire on demonstrators in Patan, but said there were no casualties.
   ``A few people came out on the streets so police had to open
fire,'' he said.
   A curfew was also imposed on the town of Butwal, 120 miles west
of Katmandu, sources from the banned Nepali Congress Party said.
   Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand met Saturday with Ganesh
Man Singh, the top leader of the Nepali Congress, which is at the
forefront of the pro-democracy movement, Bista said.
   He said no progress was made in the talks, but added that ``the
process has been initiated.''
   In another conciliatory move, the government released at least
200 people arrested since the start of the campaign. At least 100
people remained in custody, said Panday, the human rights activist.
   Witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they saw
three army trucks loaded with bodies leave Katmandu after Friday's
demonstration. A prominent opposition member said his followers
reported seeing troops throw about 300 bodies into a mass grave in
the Gokarna jungle near Katmandu.
   Other witnesses, including a doctor, spoke of seeing 200 to 300
bodies carried away by troops shortly after the firing.
   Friday's demonstrations followed King Birendra's decree
dismissing hard-line Prime Minister Marich Man Shrestha and
replacing him with Chand, who is regarded as a moderate.
   The king also promised to set up a constitutional reforms
committee and investigate accusations of police repression.
   But the pro-democracy demonstrators said the king's proclamation
was too little, too late.
   About eight hours after the proclamation was read on Radio
Nepal, a crowd of 200,000 people marched through Katmandu toward
the royal palace. Several government buildings were set afire, and
homes of politicians loyal to King Birendra were set ablaze.
   Witnesses reported seeing police open fire on the crowd 500
yards from the palace and scores of people fall to the ground.
   The pro-democracy campaign, led by the Nepali Congress and the
United Left Front, a coalition of socialist groups, started with
demonstrations and a few strikes, primarily by doctors and teachers.
   The movement snowballed last week when workers in some
government ministries, state-run banks and Royal Air Nepal walked
off their jobs. Prior to Friday's clash, at least 16 people had
been killed in confrontations with police.
   The Himalayan kingdom's only experiment with Western-style
democracy lasted two years and ended in 1961 when Birendra's
father, King Mahendra, dismissed the Nepali Congress government,
accusing it of inefficiency and corruption.
   The National Assembly, or Rashtriya Panchayat governs with the
monarch, but the king is responsible for naming one-fifth of its
140-members. Political observers say the other candidates are
elected with approval from the palace.

   Here is a chronology of the Iran-Contra affair
from the kidnapping of the first American hostage in Beirut to the
conviction Saturday of former National Security Adviser John
Poindexter:
   1984
   March 7 _ Cable News Network correspondent Jeremy Levin is
kidnapped in Beirut. Levin, freed 11 months later, is the first of
16 Americans to be taken hostage. Five were either freed or
escaped. University librarian Peter Kilburn and CIA Beirut station
chief William Buckley were murdered. Among the eight still held is
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press.
   Summer _ Iranian purchasing agents put out a call for weapons,
including TOW anti-tank missiles.
   1985
   July _ An Israeli official suggests a deal with Iran to
then-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, saying the
transfer of arms could lead to release of the hostages in Lebanon.
McFarlane takes the message to President Reagan.
   Aug. 30 _ The first plane load of U.S.-made weapons is sent from
Israel to Tehran. McFarlane and Donald Regan, White House chief of
staff, later disagree on whether Reagan approved the shipment.
Reagan says he doesn't remember.
   Sept. 14 _ A second arms shipment is sent to Tehran.
   Sept. 15 _ An American hostage, the Rev. Benjamin Weir, is
released.
   Dec. 4 _ McFarlane resigns as national security adviser and is
succeeded by Rear Adm. John Poindexter.
   Dec. 5 _ Reagan signs a presidential ``finding'' describing the
operation with Iran as an arms-for-hostages deal. Poindexter later
testifies that on Nov. 21, 1986, he tore up the only copy of the
finding.
   Dec. 5 _ In discussions with Israeli officials about Iran arms
shipments, North mentions plans to use the profits to support the
Contras.
   1986
   Jan. 17 _ Reagan signs a secret intelligence finding authorizing
CIA participation in the sales and ordering the process kept secret
from Congress.
   February _ The first direct shipment of arms from Pentagon
stocks is sent to Iran.
   April _ North writes a memo outlining plans to use $12 million
in profits from Iran arms sales for Contra aid.
   May 25 _ North and McFarlane fly to Tehran with shipment of
spare parts, expecting hostages to be freed. Negotiations break
down.
   Sept. 26 _ Iranian middlemen deposit $7 million into a Swiss
bank account. More spare parts and TOWs are prepared for shipment.
   Oct. 5 _ North flies to West Germany to meet with an Iranian
contact who says he can obtain release of one hostage for 500 TOWs.
   Nov. 2 _ American hostage David Jacobsen, held since June 1985,
is freed.
   Nov. 4 _ A pro-Syrian news magazine in Beirut breaks the news
that McFarlane had flown to Iran to meet and negotiate with
officials there.
   Nov. 13 _ The White House admits selling arms to Iran, despite a
public policy of supporting an international arms boycott of the
nation, which it has branded a terrorist state. Reagan denies the
administration has bargained with terrorists or sold arms for
hostages.
   Nov. 21 _ CIA Director William Casey briefs the Senate
Intelligence Committee on the arms deal, but makes no mention of
the diversion of funds. North and his secretary, Fawn Hall, shred,
alter and remove documents from his office.
   Nov. 25 _ Reagan announces North has been fired and Poindexter
has resigned. Attorney General Edwin Meese discloses that $10
million to $30 million in arms-sale profits were diverted to
Contras.
   Nov. 26 _ Reagan sets up the Tower Commission to review the role
of National Security Council.
   Dec. 1-3 _ The Senate Intelligence Committee begins an inquiry
by questioning McFarlane. North and Poindexter, meanwhile, invoke
the Fifth Amendment.
   Dec. 19 _ Lawrence Walsh is appointed independent counsel to
investigate the deal. Both houses of Congress select investigating
committees.
   1987
   Feb. 18 _ The Tower Commission rebukes Reagan for failing to
control the national security staff.
   March 4 _ Reagan acknowledges in a televised speech his Iranian
initiative deteriorated into an arms-for-hostages deal. ``It was a
mistake,'' he says.
   April 29 _ Carl ``Spitz'' Channell pleads guilty to illegally
raising funds for the Contras. He was sentenced to two years
probation.
   May 5 _ Congressional Iran-Contra hearings begin with testimony
from retired Air Force Gen. Richard Secord, who describes how $3.5
million in proceeds from arms sales to Iran were diverted to
Contras.
   May 6 _ Casey dies.
   May 11 _ McFarlane begins four days of testimony, during which
he says Reagan instructed his staff in 1984 to find ways around the
congressional ban on U.S. military aid to Contras.
   July 7 _ North testifies that he had authorization from his
superiors to divert arms-sale money to the Contras, and that Casey
knew of it all along. North says he always assumed Reagan knew
about it. But he says he never discussed the plan with the
president or received written presidential authorization for it.
   July 15 _ Poindexter testifies he never told Reagan that the
arms sale proceeds were being diverted to the Contras. Poindexter
says Reagan authorized a straight arms-for-hostages swap in
December 1985.
   Nov. 18 _ The final report of House and Senate investigating
committees concludes Reagan bears ultimate responsibility for the
Iran-Contra affair because he allowed a ``cabal of the zealots'' to
seize control of policy and bypass the law. Committee Republicans
dissent, saying the mistakes amounted only to errors of judgment.

   Children, those who most need protection
from the law, often become its victims, legal experts said Saturday.
   ``The bitter fact is that the status of children in America has
deteriorated over the past several decades,'' U.S. Court of Appeals
Judge Patricia Wald told about 400 lawyers, judges and other
professionals in the opening session of ``Lawyers for Children in
the 1990s.''
   The conference on children's legal rights was aimed at promoting
what one lawyer called the practice of ``pediatric law.''
   The conference, organized by the Harvard Law School Children and
Family Rights Project, was a nuts-and-bolts examination of what
lawyers could _ and should _ do to help society's children,
according to Howard Davidson, an American Bar Association director
specializing in children's issues.
   ``The courts that children are involved with are often the worst
in the system,'' Davidson said in an interview. ``They should be
the best.''
   Unlike bankruptcy proceedings, for example, when there's time to
examine every nuance of a case, a juvenile court judge ``is lucky
if he can put five minutes in to say, `What's this all about?''' he
said. ``We've misplaced our priorities.''
   ``If juvenile courts were open to the public, if people knew how
resource-poor, how overwhelmed the system was, I would hope they
wouldn't stand for it,'' Davidson said.
   The conference's panel discussions were more than an opportunity
to trade horror stories about the system.
   Rather, Davidson said, the goal was to provide practical
knowledge for lawyers who represent children or who could volunteer
to represent children through pro bono work _ services provided for
free.
   ``We want to be to children what pediatrics are to doctors,'' he
said.
   One way of helping children is through ``guardian ad litem''
programs, in which children in both abuse and juvenile delinquency
cases are represented by an attorney, Davidson said.
   Another is by providing more services for victims of domestic
violence, said conference chairwoman Sarah M. Buel, a third-year
Harvard law student.
   Buel, a 12-year veteran of battered women programs, rattled off
survey after survey indicating a link between juvenile crime and
violence in the home. She called for more intervention to protect
women and their children.
   A 1986 study by the Hazelton Foundation found that 63 percent of
all boys and young men age 11 to 20, who had committed murder, had
killed the person battering their mother, Buel said.
   ``They've taken on the role that we've failed to do,'' she said.
   Buel was herself a battered wife, a single mother and former
welfare recipient who survived through a social service network.
After putting herself through undergraduate school, she is now
completing her law degree and hopes to specialize in family law.
   She decried the small amount of time many law schools devote to
teaching the legal rights of children, compared with the ``15
courses on advanced taxes and services.'' As for Harvard, ``We have
nothing; we have family law court, that's all,'' she said.
   The need for legal volunteers to keep track of children caught
up in the foster-case system was stressed in a panel discussion by
Louisville, Ky., District Court Judge Tom McDonald.
   He cited the case of ``Eugene,'' a baby born blind and with
cerebral palsy to a teen-age mother. He was placed in foster care
at one year of age weighing 17 pounds. When Eugene was 10, the
state finally got around to checking on his condition and removed
him from the foster home; he still weighed 17 pounds, McDonald said.
   ``Our law used to pretend that there was a benevolent aspect of
society constantly working to improve the lot of these children,''
Wald told the conference. ``Now at least we admit that is not
always so.''

<HEAD>Indian Sovereignty Is Worth Dying For To Besieged Mohawks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE HENDRICKS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALTONA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To a small band of Mohawk Indians living in
the forest around Miner Lake, their territory is a sovereign nation
totally independent of the United States and New York state.
   The Mohawks at Miner Lake are at a standoff with state troopers
who have had them surrounded since March 30, when a Vermont
National Guard helicopter on a medical emergency mission was forced
down after it was struck by gunfire that caused minor wounds to a
doctor on board.
   Troopers have vowed to investigate the shots they think came
from the Indian land, the Mohawks say they'll die for their
sovereignty. They have investigated, they say, and turned up
nothing.
   Continuing negotiations have gone nowhere. Offers made by the
Indians to allow police on the land have been rejected so far by
the state as too narrow and limiting for their investigation.
   ``Things are pretty much the same as they have been,'' state
police Lt. Donald Romanchuk said Saturday.
   The Mohawks are righteous, viewing their community as perhaps
the last frontier for the traditional Mohawk way of life.
   Isolated behind barricades, though, resourceful Mohawks have
sometimes resorted to the 1990 method of getting their message out:
by fax machine.
   ``The Mohawk People have never relinquished their land. They
have never given up being a people as independent as possible,''
said their spokesman, Darryl Martin. ``In order to survive and not
be assimilated into western culture, we keep this law alive today.''
   Those in the community, known as Ganienkeh, do not care what
judges, governors or state troopers in the United States say about
the complicated issue of Indian tribal sovereignty.
   ``Sovereignty is not something somebody can give you,'' said
Martin. ``Sovereignty comes from the people. We are not waiting for
some commission somewhere to decide whether we are sovereign. We
are sovereign.
   ``We respect the laws of the United States when we travel on
that land as guests. Our laws apply here.''
   New York officials cite acts of Congress giving them criminal
jurisdiction over the Indian lands as justification for their
investigation of the helicopter shooting. The Indians cite
treaties. The state also has sued the Indians to try to close a
bingo hall that opened in 1988.
   A lawyer representing the Indians, Dennis Curtin, called the
Ganienkeh residents ``fundamentalist'' Mohawks.
   ``They're trying to preserve their culture, their language,
their heritage, their environment,'' he said.
   ``When you look at the rest of society, theirs is one to be
looked up to,'' said Curtin, who insists that fears of bloodshed at
Ganienkeh are legitimate. ``Absolutely every one of them is willing
to die for sovereignty.''
   The Ganienkeh Mohawks first set up their traditional settlement
by takig over state land around Moss Lake 150 miles to the
southwest in 1974. The Moss Lake occupation erupted into violence
the same year when gunfire from the encampment wounded a man and a
9-year-old girl passing by in separate cars. The Mohawks said they
had been fired upon first.
   In a response similar to the present situation outside Miner
Lake, state troopers set up roadblocks around Moss Lake in an armed
standoff that lasted more than three years. No arrests were ever
made in connection with the shootings.
   It was at Moss Lake that Gov. Mario Cuomo learned firsthand how
important sovereignty is to these Mohawks. Then New York's
secretary of state, Cuomo negotiated an end to the tense situation
by persuading the Mohawks to move to their present community near
the Canadian border.
   ``It's a complicated thing because the Indians regard themselves
as a sovereignty,'' Cuomo said. ``They had never dealt with
anything under a sovereignty. They are a nation and they will deal
only with a nation.''
   Cuomo finally gained credibility with the Mohawk negotiators by
persuading the FBI to deputize a state police official, qualifying
him as a federal representative in the eyes of the traditionalist
Mohawks.
   ``It took us weeks and weeks to figure that simple thing out,
but it is very important to the Indians because it involves their
understanding of themselves,'' said Cuomo. ``They see themselves as
a nation.''
   Fifty miles to the west at the St. Regis Akwasasne reservation,
the pros and cons of sovereignty has divided the 4,000 Mohawks who
live there.
   Seth Shapiro, the lawyer defending Kakwirakeron in a federal
court trial on charges he led armed defiance of a state police raid
on casinos at the St. Regis Mohawk reservation, tried
unsuccessfully to apply the Helsinki Accord to the Indians.
   ``There is an absolute parallel to what is going on with
Lithuania and the Soviet Union,'' Shapiro said. ``We believe in
sovereignty with Lithuania. For all these other places we say
sovereignty is important, but not when it comes to our Native
Americans. ... They just want to be left alone.''

   Radicals stormed out of a Communist meeting in
Latvia Saturday after fellow delegates refused to declare the party
independent from Moscow. In Lithuania, hundreds of thousands of
people held a defiant pro-independence rally.
   The two events underscored the different pace at which the
neighboring Baltic republics are moving as their residents clash
over attempts to restore the independence lost in 1940 with their
forced incorporation into the Soviet Union.
   Lithuania's Parliament, like the republic as a whole dominated
by ethnic Lithuanians, declared independence March 11.
   Latvian pro-independence politicians have been unable to go as
far as those in Lithuania because the indigenous population
comprises only 54 percent of the republic's 2.7 million population.
Russians make up about 33 percent, Byelorussians 5 percent and
Poles and Ukraines 3 percent each.
   About 270 delegates, most of them ethnic Latvians, walked out of
a party congress on its second day after a draft platform that
would have established an autonomous Latvian Communist Party was
voted down, a journalist reported.
   Alex Grigoriev, an editor of a grassroots political group's
newspaper, said by telephone from the Latvian capital, Riga, that a
majority of the 800 or so delegates felt the platform would have
gone too far toward independence. The platform stopped short of a
complete break from the Moscow-based national Communist Party.
   The delegates who stormed out of the session had favored a more
radical platform that would have formally split the 177,000-member
Latvian party from Moscow. But they supported another version
calling for autonomy, preserving some ties with Moscow, Grigoriev
explained. That version, which was voted down, apparently had the
support of the republic's leadership and the Kremlin, the
journalist said.
   He said the walkout was included in a live broadcast of the
session on state-run Latvian television, which he was monitoring.
   After they left, the radical delegates met separately in the
same building where the congress was held, the Political Education
House, and planned another session of their own April 14 to form a
separate party.
   Late Saturday, Lithuanian radio reported the delegates formed a
committee to try to break the deadlock, but it was not clear what
action congress would take next.
   In the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, a crowd official media
estimated at 300,000 massed for the largest pro-independence rally
since the republic's Parliament voted March 11 to secede from the
Soviet Union, escalating a clash of wills with the Kremlin.
   The size of the rally, held in a park, called into question the
Kremlin's emphasis on what it claims is widespread opposition in
Lithuania to independence. Anti-independence rallies in Vilnius
have attracted only 50,000 to 100,000 residents. Lithuania's
population is 3.8 million.
   Military helicopters showered leaflets on Saturday's
demonstration, which followed weeks tension between the republic
and the Kremlin, which sent troops to take over several Vilnius
buildings and arrest Lithuanian army deserters.
   The leaflets quoted President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's criticism
of the independence drive, and some bore caricatures of Lithuanian
President Vytautas Landsbergis, Elona Rukene of Lithuanian radio
said in a telephone interview.
   Landsbergis spoke to the crowd about the leaflets as they rained
down.
   ``For 70 years they've been littering the whole world and
Lithuania, but their end is clear: their pamphlets and they
themselves will end up on the trash heap of history,'' the
Lithuanian leader said, according to Eduardas Potashinskas of
Lithuanian television.
   The Soviet government has barred Western journalists from
Lithuania.
   Landsbergis told the crowd that Lithuanians would never revoke
their pledge to be independent, and a message to Gorbachev was
adopted defending the decision to secede and calling the appeal
``popular diplomacy paving the way toward friendly relations'' with
the Kremlin.
   In another development, the official Soviet news agency Tass
reported that the Lithuanian government told local authorities to
end support services to military draft boards and called on the
republic's youth to refuse service in the army. An army official in
Moscow told Tass the actions were illegal.

<HEAD>College Student Found Innocent of Drowning Newborn</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A college student who claimed she didn't
remember being pregnant or giving birth was found innocent by
reason of insanity Saturday in the drowning of her newborn in a
dormitory toilet.
   Claire Hilary Moritt, 18, of Hollywood burst into tears of joy
and hugged her attorneys when the jury returned its verdict after
nearly 17 hours of deliberations over three days.
   ``I knew from gut instinct. I knew I wasn't guilty,'' said the
woman, who insisted the jury keep trying for a verdict when it
twice declared itself hopelessly deadlocked. ``I couldn't go
through it again.''
   Ms. Moritt, who would have faced life in prison if convicted of
first-degree murder, was ordered by Circuit Judge Richard Lazzara
to continue psychiatric care in her hometown for as long as is
necessary.
   ``I'll never be able to put this behind me,'' she told
reporters. ``But I'm definitely going back to college. ... I want
to study law and be able to help other people.''
   The Hillsborough Community College student was charged with
drowning the 6-pound, 9-ounce boy only minutes after giving birth
in her high-rise dormitory on Oct. 23.
   Roommates heard a baby's cries before they found Ms. Moritt in
the bathroom covered in blood and took her to the hospital. When
they returned, they found the baby stuffed headfirst in the
commode, wrapped in bloody towels and sheets.
   Nine mental health experts testified for the defense that Ms.
Moritt suffered from a dissociative disorder in which she detatched
herself from her pregnancy and everything to do with it.
   They testified in the two-week trial that she was out of touch
with reality and couldn't have known right from wrong at the time.
   Although many first-degree murder defendants have tried the
temporary insanity defense in Hillsborough County, Ms. Moritt is
the first to win a acquittal in 14 years.
   ``One of the reasons the defense hasn't been successful is that
few people have the courage to do what Claire Moritt did,'' said
defense attorney Paul Jeske, noting that she consistently rejected
plea offers on lesser charges that would have meant as little as
one year in jail.
   ``By going to trial, she was risking a minimum of 25 years of
her life _ she would be 43 years old when she got out,'' Jeske said.
   Assistant State Attorney Stephen Crawford, who portrayed the
defendant as a selfish, immature woman who killed the baby because
it was an inconvenience, left court without answering reporters'
questions.
   ``All she had was a baby _ that's it. We just want to put this
behind us,'' said father Sheldon Moritt, adding that the ordeal did
not leave him bitter or angry.
   The same could not be said of Brad Staskowski, Ms. Moritt's
boyfriend from Hollywood who has acknowledged being the baby's
father. He said he wants the relationship to continue _ somewhere
else.
   ``I love her very much and I hope we can have a life together,''
he said. ``But I've had my share of times with this town. ... I
don't think we'll be coming back.''

   Some see them as invaders, others consider
them economic saviors. But nearly everyone agrees this tiny
Appalachian town won't be the same with the arrival of 183 college
freshmen from Japan.
   ``I think there was some negative thinking and fear,'' said
Mayor Donna Stewart. ``But I think a lot of that went away after we
learned something about Japanese culture and met some other
students from Japan.
   ``The biggest thing, I think, is going to be patience. On both
sides.''
   Sixty students, fresh from Japanese high schools, arrived
Saturday at Salem-Teikyo University, created in July in a merger of
Salem College and Japan's Teikyo University. The rest of the
Japanese are due later this week.
   The students, who looked tired and bewildered after their
2{-hour ride from Pittsburgh aboard a chartered bus, said they were
surprised by their new surroundings.
   ``I'm happy to be here,'' said Yoshikawa Wataru, 19, of Tokyo.
``The spaces are so wide-open here and it's cold.'' Temperatures in
West Virginia were in the 30s and 40s Saturday.
   Akemi Matsumoto, 18, of Tokyo said she was a bit disappointed
that there were no shops or department stores in this town of 2,700
about 140 miles southwest of Pittsburgh.
   ``I was very surprised that there weren't any shops,'' she said.
``I didn't know it would be so wide open, but it's very nice.''
   This is Matsumoto's second trip to the United States. She was in
this country for a month two years ago.
   ``I'm here to study American business. My first purpose is to
learn to speak better English, and I want to make many friends in
America,'' Matsumoto said.
   Classes in a new year-round schedule begin April 23.
   ``I think our students will be very happy at Salem,'' said Jungi
Ikawa, the students' campus adviser. ``It's close to New York and
Washington, D.C., but set in a back-to-the-land atmosphere.
   ``In Japan, the colleges are crowded and noisy,'' said Ikawa.
``This is the opposite. It is very quiet here and the hills are
beautiful. The students can see nature and even animals right on
campus.''
   Teikyo, with 26,000 students in Japan and branches in Britain
and the Netherlands, last month announced a similar merger with
Westmar College in Le Mars, Iowa. Classes at Teikyo Westmar
University begin this fall.
   The university also operates a Pacific studies program with
Regis College near Denver. Other Japanese plans include a two-year
college in Maryland and a $250 million school near Washington,
D.C., for U.S and Japanese students.
   Many educators welcome the growing Japanese investment in U.S.
higher education. Such mergers give Japanese institutions
international prestige and provide the U.S. colleges, in some
cases, get much-needed capital.
   Before the merger, Salem College was struggling with 400
students and no endowment on a campus designed for 1,200. Teikyo
paid off the college's debts and boosted salaries an average 27
percent with a $12 million investment.
   Teikyo, which set up a $7.5 million endowment and will award
$400,000 in annual scholarships to Appalachian students, owns the
101-year-old school's grounds and plant, leasing it back to the
school.
   The school expects to spend $40 million to $60 million on
improvements, equipment and staff. An enrollment of 500 American
students and 500 Japanese students is planned by 1995.
   Americans will be required to attend two semesters each school
year and Japanese three, at a cost of about $5,000 a semester.
Asian studies will be stressed for Americans, and intensive English
courses for the Japanese.
   ``The people who attend Salem-Teikyo will be among the leaders
in business and politics someday in their respective countries,''
said Salem-Teikyo President Ronald E. Ohl. ``They will understand
each other and operate from a global viewpoint instead of the
narrow self-interest we see so much of today.''
   Most changes on campus have been cosmetic, but real changes will
be evident when Japanese and American live and learn side-by-side,
said senior Thad Davis, president of the student administration at
Salem-Teikyo.
   ``Some students are worried that things are going to get tougher
academically,'' said Davis, 24. ``Right now, a lot feel the
American students aren't being treated equally. They're using the
money to fix up dorms and the grounds for the Japanese. Those
things should have been done in prior years.''
   Ohl said some students may be unable to adapt to the changes.
``Ultimately, a couple years down the road, the only people who
will be here are those who want this kind of program,'' Ohl said.

<HEAD>Gay Activists Debate Kicking Public Figures Out of Closet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Few privileges are more sacrosanct in the gay
community than the right to decide for oneself when and whether to
tell friends, family, co-workers or even strangers, ``I'm a
homosexual.''
   But the AIDS epidemic has produced a new generation of militant
gays who believe not only that every homosexual should come out of
the closet, but that those public figures who refuse should be
kicked out and the door locked behind them.
   This new philosophy has given rise to a debate (and a new verb):
whether to ``out'' or not to ``out'' a person, and under what
circumstances.
   ``Public figures don't have a right to privacy,'' says Ann
Northrop, a gay youth counselor in New York and a member of the
militant AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, known as ACTUP. ``They
certainly have a right to privacy about what particular sex acts
they perform but in terms of sexual orientation, no, I don't
believe they have a right to privacy.''
   Gabriel Rotello, editor of ``OutWeek,'' a New York magazine
devoted to making the world more hospitable to homosexuals, said it
is not his position that all gay public figures be forced out _ yet.
   ``We were the ones who planted the germ of the idea that maybe
this might be an appropriate thing to start thinking about,''
Rotello said.
   His magazine has gained notoriety for gleefully pushing famous
people to the edge of the closet and leaving them clinging by their
fingernails. ``OutWeek'' has published deliberately provocative
columns, features, letters and, for two issues, a list called
``Peek-A-Boo ...,'' which was just the names of of prominent people
_ readers could draw their own conclusions.
   Last month, ``OutWeek'' published a piece purporting to prove
that a prominent New York businessman was gay. Accompanying the
feature was an editorial rationalizing that the ``outing'' was for
the benefit of gay and lesbian youth who need role models.
   But some gay political activists just say no to the whole
question.
   ``We will not make the decision for anybody, public figure or
private citizen, to bring them out of the closet, no matter what
they're doing in public life,'' said Urvashi Vaid, executive
director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington.
   Timothy McFeeley, executive director of the Human Rights
Campaign Fund, a gay lobbying group, agreed.
   ``On a more philosophical level, I object to the practice
because I think what our movement really is about is privacy and
allowing people a certain area of privacy even if they're public
figures,'' he said.
   Somewhere in the middle is Thomas Stoddard, a lawyer and
executive director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund
in New York. He said he can envision circumstances under which it
might be justified to ``out'' someone.
   ``I would suggest that tug of war can be best resolved through
what one might call a nexus test _ a test of job-connectedness,''
Stoddard said. ``If sexual orientation is related in some fashion
to job performance or evaluation of job performance, then that
issue is an appropriate subject of public discussion or
disclosure.''
   In recent months, gay activists have held protests to shame
elected officials by charging that they weren't doing enough to
combat acquired immune deficiency syndrome, even though they
themselves were alleged to be homosexual.
   Last March, for example, about 3,000 members of ACTUP stormed
New York's City Hall to demand more money and care for people with
AIDS. Some demonstrators wore placards ridiculing then-Mayor Edward
I. Koch's assertion that he is heterosexual.
   Koch's sexual preferences were the subject of rumor from his
first run for mayor as an unmarried congressman in 1977. At that
time, Koch refused to answer questions on the subject, saying that
any answer would indicate that sexual preference should be an issue.
   At the same time he was accompanied by former Miss America Bess
Myerson at campaign stops and seemed to be actively cultivating
gossip that the city might have a First Lady if he was elected.
   Then last year Koch unexpectedly proclaimed his heterosexuality
on a radio talk show during his failed bid for a fourth term.
   By raising the issue himself, Koch signaled it was OK to discuss
the subject of his sexuality, according to Stoddard.
   ``Up until that point, it seems to me, the subject of his sexual
orientation ought to have been off-bounds because it did not relate
to job performance or public character,'' Stoddard said.
   So when does it relate?
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., one of two openly gay U.S.
congressmen, and the only one who came out voluntarily, says
hypocrisy is the test for any public personality.
   ``I think you have a right to privacy but not hypocrisy,'' he
said in an interview. ``Anybody who is himself `X' or does `X' and
then uses `X' against other people ought to be exposed as a
hypocrite.''
   But Frank stopped short of so doing last June.
   That was when the Republican Party circulated a memo falsely
implying that House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., was gay. Frank
threatened to blow the cover of truly homosexual GOP congressmen,
and most Washingtonians believed his list would be accurate.
   However, the gay-bashing stopped and Frank kept his counsel.
   Asked if he would feel compelled now to ``out'' a colleague who,
for example, voted for legislation to exclude homosexuals from
basic civil rights protection, Frank said no.
   ``This is an option, not an obligation,'' he said, adding,
however, that forcing some out under those circumstances would be
justified.
   Robert Bauman, a former Maryland congressman who lost his seat
in 1980 after being arrested for soliciting sex with a teen-age
boy, said he could see no justification for pushing anybody out of
the closet.
   ``If hypocrisy was a justification for exposure, everybody in
public life would be dragged out into the streets and pilloried''
for something, said Bauman, who was an outspoken conservative while
in Congress.
   ``It would be better if everyone voluntarily decided to identify
themselves in their own circles or publicly, if that was
appropriate,'' he said. ``Because then everyone would see the
extent of gay and lesbian presence in America and the world.''

   A Canadian who won a new trial on his
conviction for trying to export metals used in nuclear weapons to
Pakistan in 1986 pleaded guilty to lesser charges rather than face
another trial.
   Arshad Z. Pervez, formerly of Toronto, was released after being
sentenced in the new case to 32 months in prison, time he has
already served, Assistant U.S. Attorney Amy Kurland said Saturday.
   Pervez pleaded guilty Wednesday to attempting to export
beryllium, a material crucial to nuclear weapons production. In
return, prosecutors dropped charges of conspiracy and making false
statements to the government, she said.
   Pervez, a native of Pakistan who became a Canadian citizen, was
to be arraigned Wednesday on a new indictment, but surprised
prosecutors with his plea, Ms. Kurland said. Pervez said he planned
to return to Canada.
   His attorney, Jeffrey Miller, did not return telephone calls
Saturday.
   Kurland said Pervez contacted Carpenter Technology Corp., in
Reading, in late 1986 to ask about purchasing maraging 350 steel _
a high-strength nickel-iron alloy _ that is used to build nuclear
weapons.
   A Carpenter official who knew that the import of the metal to
Pakistan was restricted became suspicious and contacted the
government.
   Under federal law, the Commerce Department must license such
metal shipments because Pakistan has refused to sign an
international nuclear nonproliferation treaty, Ms. Kurland said.
   Pervez was required to show that the metals would not be put to
military use in Pakistan, but the government alleged that Pervez
intended to ship the metals to a retired Pakistani general named
Inam Ul-Haq.
   Ul-Haq also was indicted with Pervez and still faces arrest in
this country, Ms. Kurland said.
   U.S. Customs agents posing as a Carpenter employee and Commerce
Department officials arranged for Pervez to buy an export license,
and then arrested him when he paid $1,000 for the license.
   Although Pervez claimed he was entrapped by the government, he
was convicted in 1987 of attempted exportation of beryllium,
conspiracy and making false statements to the government. He was
sentenced to five years in prison.
   He was acquitted of bribery, interstate travel in aid of
racketeering and illegally trying to get a license to export
maraging 350.
   A 1988 U.S. Supreme Court ruling changed federal entrapment
laws, and in March 1989, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
granted Pervez a new trial on the charges of conspiracy and attempt
to export beryllium.
   U.S. District Judge James Giles then granted a new trial on the
charges of making false statements and a superseding indictment,
similar to the original, was returned in March.

<HEAD>Efforts Pressed for Non-Communist East German Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservatives and the opposition intensified
efforts Saturday to form the country's first non-Communist
government before April 15, with both sides declaring readiness to
discuss personnel and policy issues.
   Martin Kirchner, general secretary of the conservative Christian
Democratic Union, again claimed a coalition could be formed by
Thursday, even without the left-leaning Social Democrats. They are
the country's second biggest party.
   The coalition talks began late Saturday afternoon at the House
of Parliamentarians in East Berlin. Kirchner and Social Democratic
leader Markus Meckel said beforehand they were prepared to discuss
division of cabinet posts and the policy line of the new goverment.
   Kirchner said the new government would have about 22 portfolios
and that names of future ministers and policy matters were expected
to be discussed at Saturday's third round of talks.
   Earlier in the day, Meckel said a new government must be formed
quickly, but that coalition talks may have to continue after Easter
with the conservative forces.
   Meckel also told a news conference that the party wants to be
informed of plans for a state treaty under discussion in Bonn to
set the rules for unifying the two German states.
   He called on the East German Christian Democrats, who won the
March 18 election, to use its contacts in West Germany to obtain a
copy of the plans to help the future government prepare its
policies.
   The Social Democrats on Friday had charged the Christian
Democrats with failing to present position papers at earlier
coalition talks. Meckel said at the time he doubted that a broad
coalition government could be formed by Easter.
   The Christian Democrats responded by saying the conservative
alliance it leads would be able to form a coalition government and
gain a majority in parliament with East Germany's centrist parties.
They said they would not necessarily need the Social Democrats.
   However, such a move would not provide the two-thirds majority
needed for decisions on quick unification with West Germany, which
the conservatives want.
   The Christian Democratic Union is part of a conservative
alliance that also includes Democratic Awakening and the German
Social Union.
   Meckel said Saturday after a meeting of his party's leadership
that it supported continuing the coalition talks.
   ``All efforts should be made to create a government quickly, if
possible before Easter,'' or April 15, Meckel said.
   He said, however, that if the no agreement on a coalition could
be reached before the holiday, ``more talks after Easter are
possible.''
   Lothar de Maiziere, who heads the conservative alliance, was
charged Thursday by the country's first freely elected parliament
to form a new government.

   Survivors of a fire on a North Sea ferry
said Saturday that alarms didn't work and an apparently untrained
crew didn't always speak the same language, aggravating the
disaster that killed about 150 people.
   ``It took a very long time to get the lifeboats out. Then nobody
knew how to get them down,'' said Eli Kvale Nielsen, describing how
her lifeboat hung suspended over the North Sea, still attached to
the burning ferry, the Scandinavian Star. ``We were hanging there,
with smoke coming out ....''
   ``We went on board a death trap,'' said Greta Holen of Norway,
another of about 340 survivors. ``It was pure luck that I
survived.''
   Survivors and rescuers told stories of confusion during one of
Scandinavia's worst sea disasters. Passengers trying to reach the
open decks lost their way in narrow, smoky corridors and died
there. Some were asphyxiated in their cabins.
   Tom Brokopp, a doctor at Uddevalla hospital, near Lysekil,
quoted several passengers as saying alarms didn't work and crew
members had trouble understanding each other.
   ``It was chaotic,'' Neilsen said. ``It was clear that the crew
was not trained for this kind of situation.''
   News reports said the Bahamian-registered ferry had a mixed
Portuguese and Filipino crew, with Norwegian officers, and that the
crew had joined the vessel within the past two weeks.
   When the fire broke out, some passengers were still awake but
many were asleep in cabins.
   ``We woke up in the middle of the night. I heard a noise
outside. I went out of the cabin and saw thick, black smoke,'' said
Danish passenger Leo Odeland, an Oslo resident traveling with his
wife and two daughters.
   ``Nothing happened when I pushed the fire alarm. I hadn't heard
the alarm go off. At another place where there was supposed to be
an alarm, nothing was there.''
   Odeland said the crew was ``apparently new and untrained.''
   ``It was hard to get the lifeboat into the water, and then the
motor didn't start,'' he said, adding that the lifeboat drifted
away and a Soviet freighter picked them up.
   Bettina Kold, 20, a Danish employee in the ferry's duty-free
shop, said her alarm clock woke her at 4:45 a.m. According to
rescuers, the Scandinavian Star radioed a distress call at 2:30 a.m.
   Kold said she smelled smoke but heard no fire alarm. She found
it impossible to enter the smoke-filled corridor and waited in her
cabin for 90 minutes until a rescuer arrived.
   ``There were plenty of people aboard, and I guess they all tried
to leave at the same time,'' said Norwegian fireman Sven-Johan
Svenson. ``In the heavy smoke, it would be easy to take a wrong
turn. People would panic in those narrow corridors.
   ``Some of those who got left behind and died just didn't find
their way out.''
   ``Neither the fire alarm nor the loudspeaker worked,`` said
passenger Elisabeth Skeiro.

   Fifty-nine percent of Americans believe it's
more important to maintain good relations with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev than to recognize an independent Lithuania,
according to a poll released Saturday.
   The poll, reported in the April 16 issue of Newsweek, also found
that 66 percent of Americans questioned approved of President
Bush's handling of the situation in Eastern Europe. Some Democrats
accuse the president of failing to exert leadership as the
industrial democracies struggle to respond to and shape change in
the region.
   Bush received an 18 percent disapproval rating on Eastern Europe.
   The poll was based on 601 telephone interviews conducted by The
Gallup Organization on April 5 and 6. The margin of error is 5
percent.
   Bush's approval rating on Eastern European issues has remained
nearly constant for several months. In November 1989, he received
the backing of 63 percent, Newsweek said. In December 1989, it was
68 percent.
   On the Lithuanian question, 27 percent felt the United States
should recognize an independent country to pressure Gorbachev into
doing the same. But 59 percent said keeping good relations with the
Soviet leader was more important, and 14 percent had no opinion.
   Americans were divided on whether countries in Eastern Europe
should receive more U.S. financial aid than those in Latin America.
Twenty-eight percent wanted more money for Eastern Europe, 27
percent backed Latin America, and 26 percent said there should be
no change in foreign aid policy.
   Nineteen percent said they didn't know.

   Three firebombs tossed early Saturday
into the office of the president of Wesleyan University caused
minor damage and shook school officials. No one immediately claimed
responsibility for the attack.
   Wesleyan officials said the South College building was
unoccupied when three crudely made Molotov cocktails crashed
through the window of President William M. Chace's first-floor
office.
   There were no reports of injuries.
   The minor explosion and fire damaged a carpet and furniture, but
was limited to a seven-foot area near the window, said university
spokesman Bobby Wayne Clark. A security guard heard glass breaking
and saw man running from the area about 4 a.m., but was unable to
catch him, Clark said.
   Chace said he didn't believe the bombing was related to recent
student unrest over allegations the administration of the exclusive
liberal arts school is insensitive to minority students and faculty.
   This winter, 60 students took over the administrative offices to
protest what they said is a lack of support for minorities on
campus.

   Here is the legal status of key figures in the
Iran-Contra affair:
   _John Poindexter, former national security adviser, found guilty
at a jury trial April 7 of conspiracy, two counts of obstructing
Congress and two counts of making false statements in connection
with Reagan administration assistance to the Contras and a November
1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran. Sentencing has been set for
June 11. He faces a maximum of 25 years in prison and $1.25 million
in fines.
   _Oliver North, former National Security Council aide, found
guilty at a jury trial May 4 of three felonies _ aiding and
abetting the obstruction of Congress, destroying official documents
and accepting an illegal gratuity _ and sentenced to two years
probation, fined $150,000 and ordered to perform 1,200 hours of
community service. He is appealing the conviction, the fine and
probation while serving the community service in an anti-drug
program.
   _Robert McFarlane, former national security adviser, pleaded
guilty to four misdemeanors of withholding information from
Congress by denying that the NSC staff was soliciting support for
the Contras' military activities and helping move supplies to the
rebels and denying that he knew anything about third-country
financing of the Contras. Was placed on two years' probation, fined
$20,000 and sentenced to 200 hours of community service.
   _Richard Secord, a retired Air Force major general, pleaded
guilty Nov. 8 to lying to congressional investigators when he said
he wasn't aware of any money that went to the benefit of North from
the maze of companies known as ``the Enterprise,'' which Secord had
used in the Iran-Contra affair. Secord on Jan. 24 was sentenced to
two years probation.
   _Carl ``Spitz'' Channell, pleaded guilty to using his non-profit
National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty to raise more
than $2 million to buy weapons for the Nicaraguan rebels. Sentenced
to two years probation for conspiring to defraud the Treasury of
taxes due on the money raised with North's assistance.
   _Richard Miller, head of a Washington public relations company,
pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue
Service of taxes on contributions used to supply military aid to
the Nicaraguan Contras. Sentenced to two years probation.
   _Albert Hakim, Iranian-born businessman who with Secord ran
``the Enterprise,'' pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of aiding and
abetting in supplementing North's income by paying for a security
fence at North's home. Hakim was fined $5,000 and sentenced to two
years probation Feb. 1. He agreed to forgo his claims on more than
$7 million in profits from the Reagan administration's Iran arms
sales. Also, a company he set up, Lake Resources, pleaded guilty to
theft of government property in connection with Iran arms sale
money diverted from the U.S. government. The judge ordered that
company be dissolved.
   _Joseph Fernandez, former CIA station chief in Costa Rica,
charged with obstruction and making false statements in connection
with his assistance to North's Contra resupply network. The judge
in the case said the charges must be dismissed due to the attorney
general's ban on the use of classified material Fernandez needs for
his defense. Iran-Contra prosecutors are appealing.
   _Former CIA agent Thomas Clines, indicted for allegedly failing
to report some of his income to the Internal Revenue Service that
he received for working for North's Contra resupply network.
Clines, a business partner of Secord and Hakim, has pleaded
innocent and is scheduled to go on trial May 14 in U.S. District
Court in Baltimore. Clines located a European arms dealer as a
source of weapons for the Contras and helped arrange for shipping
and lined up crews to transport the supplies to the rebels.

   A cold snap in the South on Saturday set record lows in several
cities, and snow fell in the Northeast.
   The coldest temperatures on record for so late in the season
were set at Evansville, Ind., 23 degrees, and across the Ohio River
in nearby Paducah, Ky., 24 degrees.
   Rain showers were scattered across Delaware, Maryland and
southern New Jersey. Rain also fell from south-central Idaho into
northern Utah.
   Snow showers lingered over the northern section of lower
Michigan in the morning Saturday.
   Snow also fell across New York state, western and southern
Pennsylvania, and southeastern New England, the National Weather
Service said.
   Chatham, Mass., had 2 inches of snow, and Johnstown, Pa., had 1
inch.
   Snow in New York City postponed an exhibition baseball game at
Shea Stadium between the crosstown rivals, the Mets and Yankees.
   ``It's not really that odd. People think, `Oh, it's snowing in
April.' It's just a little unusual,'' said meteorologist Gene
Salerno. ``Now, if this was July ...''
   Unseasonable cold was expected to reach into the Southeast late
Saturday. Frost and freeze warnings were posted over northern
Alabama, northern and central Georgia, the mountains and foothills
of South Carolina and all of North Carolina except the coastline.
   Record breaking cold also was expected overnight Saturday in
east central Tennessee.
   Showers were forecast across the mid-section of the Rockies on
Sunday.
   The low for the nation Saturday was 8 degrees at Brookings, S.D.
   Temperatures dipped to 29 degrees in Hot Springs and Fort Smith,
Ark., breaking their records for April 7. Records also were broken
at Huntsville, Ala., 29; Jackson, Miss., 31; Mena, Ark., 31.; and
Springfield, Mo., 25.

   Rioting broke out at Dartmoor Prison in southwest
England Saturday with some injuries reported, as authorities in
northern England negotiated with fewer than 25 inmates who
continued their weeklong uprising.
   The Home Office said prisoners in Dartmoor's D Wing _ which
houses 100 inmates _ refused to return to their cells.
   Dartmoor prison governor John May, speaking to journalists
outside the prison, said a small number of people were injured. But
he gave no details.
   He said 103 prisoners were believed to have taken control of one
wing and about five hooded prisoners were on the roof. Prisoners
also had control of the roof of another wing.
   May said prison officers had received intelligence there would
be trouble this weekend, but he did not say what measures were
taken to prevent it.
   Prison Officers' Association head John Bartell said a search of
the prison had turned up a hoard of weapons and some prisoners had
been transferred.
   Extra staff was brought in from nearby prisons to restore order,
and police were standing by on the perimeter, a prison spokeswoman
said. No escapes were reported and the seized wing had been sealed
off, she said.
   One of Britain's most famous prisons, Dartmoor was opened in
1809 to house French prisoners from the Napoleonic Wars and is
located near Princetown in the remote and rugged moorland of
Devonshire, 160 miles southwest of London.
   As many as 120 inmates were involved in the Dartmoor
disturbance, Prison Officers' Association chairman John Bartell
said. The Devon fire brigade and ambulance service said they were
standing by at the prison.
   At Strangeways Prison near Manchester, where more than 1,500
prisoners rioted April 1, the number still on the loose was reduced
to fewer than 25, prison governor Brendan O'Friel said. Three more
surrendered Saturday afternoon.
   A helicopter hovered over the Victorian prison early in the
morning to disturb the sleep of rebellious inmates, and barking
dogs, shouting guards and powerful spotlights were also deployed to
wear down inmates after the weeklong siege.
   ``We have been using a certain amount of noise tactics to reduce
the, in our view, unauthorized access of prisoners to the media,''
O'Friel said. ``We have continued to put pressure on the prisoners
in other ways.''
   But he said authorities still hoped to negotiate an end to the
impasse.
   Strangeways had been one of the most crowded prisons in England.
It was heavily damaged in a riot that broke out at a chapel service
April 1.
   The prison, which was built in 1868 to house 970 male prisoners,
had 1,648 when the riot there broke out during a service in the
prison chapel.

<TEXT>
   Masked rebel soldiers stormed the
Manila city jail Sunday during a birthday party for a warden and
freed an officer accused of helping to lead December's failed coup,
police said.
   In a statement to reporters, the Young Officers' Union, a
shadowy group linked to the failed coup, took responsibility for
the jailbreak.
   Four other inmates held for common crimes were also freed along
with Lt. Col. Billy Bibit in the predawn raid, police said.
   Hours earlier, military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa had
warned that mutineers would try to free some of the more than 2,200
officers and enlisted men held in connection with the Dec. 1-9
failed coup.
   Police Sgt. Florentino Bagallon said jailers had ordered beer
from a nearby restaurant for a birthday celebration for deputy
warden Capt. Manuel Roxas.
   When they opened the compound gate to allow the delivery man
inside, about 15 masked gunmen forced their way in, disarmed the
guards and then pried open Bibit's cell with a metal bar.
   Bibit and the others fled in two cars and a van, Bagallon said.
   At about the same time, armed men attacked the police station
next to the jail in a hail of gunfire, disarmed policemen and cut
telephone lines from the building.
   The gunmen fled with three pistols seized from the guards.
Police said the rebels arrived in a stolen dump truck, which they
abandoned after the raid.
   Police said they were preparing negligence charges against at
least two jail guards. The guards refused to talk with police
Superintendent Col. Ernesto Diokno until they had conferred with a
lawyer.
   Bibit, intelligence chief of the customs bureau, was arrested in
January for allegedly raiding the customs armory to provide weapons
during the coup attempt, in which 113 people were killed and more
than 600 wounded.
   It was the sixth and bloodiest attempt to topple President
Corazon Aquino since she took office in the 1986 ``people power''
revolution that ousted the late President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Bibit was described as a member of the core group that planned
and led the coup attempt. Bagallon said Bibit had been detailed to
the customs bureau but was still on active duty in the military.
   Bibit was the only alleged coup participant among the Manila
jail's 300 inmates, police said.
   Others in the conspiracy are detained at military stockades,
where there have been complaints about lax security. Detainees
include about 300 officers.
   On Saturday, de Villa told reporters that renegade former Lt.
Col. Gregorio Honasan, a leader of the December coup attempt, had
been sending word to jailed comrades that his followers would try
to free them.
   De Villa dismissed Honasan's message as an attempt ``to prevent
the collapse of morale'' among the prisoners.
   Honasan also led a coup attempt in August 1987. He was arrested
the following December but escaped in April 1988 from a prison ship
in Manila Bay with the help of his guards.
   In November 1988, the commander of the Communist rebel army,
Romulo Kintanar, escaped from a military stockade along with his
wife during a birthday party for his jailer.

   Ryan White, the pale, gaunt teen-ager who
won a lengthy legal battle to attend public school, learned a hard
lesson about fear but taught the public a more important lesson
about his deadly disease, AIDS.
   ``This kid is unbelievably important to us,'' Surgeon General
Antonia Novello said in a telephone interview last week from
Washington.
   ``He's the kid who was able to communicate with adults as well
as children. He's a spokesperson for the whole AIDS crisis,''
Novello said. ``He was able to fight alone the stigmatization of
the disease.''
   White was hospitalized March 29 with an AIDS-related respiratory
infection at Riley Hospital for Children, where he remained sedated
in critical but stable condition on a ventilator Saturday.
   ``We look for optimistic trends,'' his physician, Dr. Martin
Kleiman, said Saturday. ``We have not seen enough change to change
his status.''
   White contracted AIDS in 1984 at age 13 from a blood-clotting
agent used to treat his hemophilia.
   ``He's shown us the disease is purely a disease and has no
social implications,'' Kleiman said last week.
   White gained national attention in 1985 after he was barred from
attending Western Middle School near Kokomo because of his AIDS.
His family sued. The case was in and out of courts, other families
petitioned to keep White out of school, but White finally won.
   ``Personally, I would rather have given it up a long time ago,''
White's mother, Jeanne, said during the court battle. ``It would
have been a lot easier on me and a lot easier on the rest of the
family.
   ``But, believe it or not, Ryan has always really loved school.
(Ryan's sister) Andrea says, `Boy, I wish it would be me that could
stay home.' But this is what Ryan wants to do, and I want what he
wants.''
   Mrs. White moved her family to Cicero, about 20 miles from their
home, saying they did not want to stay where they were unwanted.
White said at the time that he did not want to die in Kokomo or to
be buried there. They were welcomed by the new community and the
school system.
   The battle provided the impetus for the first revision of
Indiana's communicable disease law since its original draft in
1948, and gave many Americans a person with AIDS to identify with.
   ``He's young, white and middle-class,'' said Eric Engstrom,
executive director of the National AIDS Network. ``Many people
could see themselves in Ryan. Ryan understood that and worked to
educate people and raise awareness. He's been an incredible
catalyst for acknowledgement of the AIDS crisis.''
   Dr. Woodrow Myers, state health commissioner during White's
battle to attend school and now health commissioner for New York
City, said White answered a call for leadership.
   ``America saw in living color what it's like to be the victim of
unnecessary, unwarranted fear,'' Myers said. ``It also saw someone
who endured that struggle with bravery and with his head held high
and with a spirit of determination that I've found rare.''
   A national educational and fund-raising program to fight
misconceptions about children carrying the AIDS virus was named in
White's honor.
   ``I came face to face with death at 13 years old'' but decided
``to live a normal life,'' he testified before the White House AIDS
Commission.
   He was on the cover of People magazine. His story was dramatized
in an ABC television movie, ``The Ryan White Story,'' in which he
played a cameo role.
   While White was unconcious in his hospital bed last week,
thousands of people called the hospital to offer support.
   President Bush planted a tree during a ceremony here while
visiting the city on a political trip, and dedicated the tree to
White, saying, ``Let it be Ryan's tree.'' Singer Elton John kept a
vigil with the family and distributed $500 worth of toys to other
patients.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., called Mrs. White after a Senate
committee unanimously approved his bill providing $600 million in
emergency funds for AIDS care. ``This one's for you, Ryan,''
Kennedy said.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson visited White Saturday, accompanied by
singers Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson, who were in
Indianapolis for the Farm Aid IV benefit concert.
   Other calls have come from Vice President Dan Quayle and
entertainers Michael Jackson, Phil Donahue, Carol Burnett and
Lionel Richie.
   The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said 125,000 AIDS
cases had been reported through February and 76,031 people had died
from complications related to the disease.
   The CDC estimated 1 million people in the U.S. carry the virus.
What makes Ryan White special?
   ``Through him we learned that education of the public is
possible,'' Novello said. ``And for everyone out there who learns
to hate, someone out there learns to care because of Ryan.''

   A surprise search for weapons and drugs
triggered rioting at a prison Saturday that left one inmate dead
and six people wounded, authorities said.
   Inmates threw rocks and bottles as about 200 law enforcement
officials concluded the search at La Mesa state penitentiary, said
district attorney Jorge Mario de Regules. Some inmates fired guns,
he said.
   It was unclear where the inmates got the weapons, or who fired
the shots that killed one inmate and wounded two police officers,
he said.
   Officers fired their weapons into the air in an effort to
restore order, he said, and the violence was quelled in an hour.
   ``It was not a full-blown riot but it sure seemed like one,''
said de Regules, who took part in the search.
   All six of the wounded were taken to hospitals, but none were in
grave condition, the district attorney said.
   Handguns, knives, marijuana, cocaine and heroin were confiscated
during the search.
   The prison has about 2,000 inmates, including 200 women inmates
and children of some prisoners.

   Earrings probably won't become de rigueur
among the ranks of Portland's Finest, but policemen wishing to
adorn their ears with dainty pieces of precious metal may now do so.
   The city attorney's office has advised the police to allow male
officers to wear earrings after a policeman filed a labor grievance
recently.
   The office got involved because of a grievance filed by an
officer whose name is being withheld, said Stan Peters, president
of the Portland Police Association said.
   The grievance challenged rules on proper attire that specified
female officers must wear small, non-dangling earrings, but didn't
really address the question of ear decorations for males.
   Police officials say they'll follow the city attorney's advice,
but they don't have to like it.
   ``I don't think the public is prepared to see a male police
officer wear an earring,'' said Capt. Wayne Inman. ``But I do see a
shift in public attitudes to allow police officers to mirror
society's dress code.''

<HEAD>Drug To Go On Toxics List</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California will require aspirin makers to warn
women against taking the drug in the late stages of pregnancy, a
state science panel has decided.
   The panel on Friday classified aspirin a ``reproductive toxin''
under Proposition 65, the landmark toxics initiative law that
requires public warnings for substances that pose a risk of cancer
or birth defects.
   The warnings _ probably on aspirin labels _ must appear within
one year after a substance is formally listed in keeping with the
panel's decision.
   In making its recommendation, the panel rejected a $500,000
report prepared by the aspirin industry. That report said it found
no evidence that aspirin taken in the last three months of
pregnancy could cause excessive bleeding during delivery and other
pregnancy complications.
   The panel unanimously ruled that such risks have been shown,
based on studies involving high aspirin dosage.
   But panel members also acknowledged recent studies that aspirin
in very low doses _ half a tablet or less _ may relieve certain
medical problems suffered by pregnant women.
   They said the aspirin warning should be qualified to advise
women against taking aspirin in the last three months of pregnancy
``... unless directed to do so by your doctor.''
   Aspirin products have carried a general warning label since 1982
and certain over-the-counter aspirin substitutes also carry a label
that reads: ``It is especially important not to use aspirin during
the last three months of pregnancy unless specifically directed to
do so by your doctor because it may cause problems in the unborn
child or complications during delivery.''
   Proposition 65 mandates public warnings but does not dictate
warning labels on specific products. However, a spokesman for the
aspirin industry said a warning label seemed likely in about a year.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration notified state authorities
last week that it planned to require a new warning on
over-the-counter aspirin products similar to the warning under
review by the Proposition 65 panel.
   But science panel members said they saw no point in waiting for
federal action. Aspirin industry representatives said the FDA was
pushed into action by Proposition 65, which has served as a model
for toxics legislation across the country.

   A river ferry capsized and sank during a
fierce storm in the south, killing at least 30 people, government
radio reported Saturday. It said 186 were missing and believed
drowned.
   The double-decker ferry Sein San Pya overturned in gale-force
winds Friday afternoon with 241 people aboard, Rangoon Radio said.
   The bodies of 25 women and five men, including two Buddhist
monks, were recovered, but 186 people were still missing, the radio
said. It said 25 people were rescued.
   An earlier broadcast said 50 people were saved.
   That report said some of the dead were children and that all
those missing were presumed drowned.
   Among the people aboard the vessel were 12 crewmembers and 10
security policemen, the report said.
   The ferry was making a regular run on the Gyaing river from the
town of Moulmein, about 100 miles southeast of Rangoon, to the town
of Kyondo in the southern province of Tenasserim, the report said.
It sank about 12:30 p.m., the report said.
   The vessel went down almost immediately as the storm struck, the
broadcast said. It gave no other details.
   Ferry accidents in southern Burma have claimed many lives in
recent years.
   In May 1987, an aging vessel with 400 people aboard overturned
and sank in the Rangoon River. Reports at the time said that 283
people were rescued, but no official death toll was announced.
   In October 1989, 60 people were reported missing and believed
dead after a double-decker ferry with 170 passengers aboard sank in
a storm near Rangoon.
   Safety standards are often very lax in this southeast Asian
nation.

   Leftist rebels Saturday stormed into two
southern towns, robbing banks, looting stores and fighting battles
with government forces that left 19 people dead, authorities said.
   Police said 13 rebels and six police officers were killed during
the attacks by a total of about 150 rebels.
   Five of the officers where shot and killed when members of the
National Liberation Army and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia attacked a police station in the town of Sibundoy, 322
miles south of Bogota, said police spokesman Col. Guillermo Ramirez.
   Another policeman died in fighting in the nearby town of San
Francisco, Ramirez said.
   Rebels in both towns were looting stores and robbing banks when
they were surprised by army troops in several helicopter gunships,
Ramirez said in a live radio interview.
   He gave no other details of the fighting.
   The National Liberation Army has become the most active and most
violent of five leftist guerrilla groups in Colombia. It is headed
by a former Catholic priest, Manuel Perez.
   Authorities say the group regularly attacks army and police
patrols. It has blown up the country's main oil pipeline dozens of
times in the last three years.
   In March, the leftist group April 19 Movement laid down its
weapons and signed a peace treaty with President Virgilio Barco's
government.
   However, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the
National Liberation Army have continued attacking police and
military targets.
   The National Liberation Army has said it will never negotiate
peace with the government.

<HEAD>Tens of Thousands of Israelis Call for Election Reform</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto TLV2</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Israelis rallied
Saturday demanding electoral reform in a movement spurred by public
anger over political wheeling-and-dealing in a bid to form a new
government.
   Demonstrators who gathered in Tel Aviv's central Kings of Israel
square carried Israeli flags and wore stickers criticizing both
major political parties, Likud and Labor.
   The stickers read ``Are you sick and tired?'' and ``Horsetraders
in the market are more decent.''
   Israel television said tens of thousands protested in front of
City Hall, while Israel Army Radio estimated the crowd at 250,000.
One city official estimated it at more than 120,000. Police refused
to give estimates.
   The protest was called after Labor Party leader Shimon Peres
announced that he had formed a coalition that included a
ultra-Orthodox religious party and a defector from the right-wing
Likud bloc of caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Labor is a
left-of-center party.
   Peres informed President Chaim Herzog on Wednesday he had put
together a potential governing coalition. The announcement came two
weeks after he was assigned to try to form a new government.
   Shamir lost a no-confidence vote March 15 in a crisis triggered
by a dispute over U.S. conditions for holding Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.
   Peres forced the showdown with Shamir, who was reluctant to
accept the U.S. proposals on forming a Palestinian delegation.
   The protest campaign was initiated by a group of mayors and the
Constitution for Israel Organization, which seeks to revamp the
political system. It also won the support of President Herzog.
   Uriel Reichman, a law professor who heads the group, told Israel
radio reformers wanted direct election of the prime minister and
one half of the 120 parliament members as well as a bill of rights.
   ``Now, we are no longer lobbying. We are no longer asking. Now,
we are demanding that the change will come and right away,'' said
Reichman, who called the political maneuverings of the two major
parties a betrayal of trust.
   Critics have accused both Labor and Likud of offering government
money and political jobs to entice small religious factions and
encourage individual members of parliament to switch sides.
   Peres reportedly gave $3.5 million to religious institutions
affiliated with parties that he hoped would support his bid for
power hours before he left the finance minister's post last month.
   At the same time, Shamir's Likud raised $2.5 million from party
contributors as a guarantee to underwrite its promise of a cabinet
post for Yitzhak Modai, a Likud ally who was threatening to defect
to Labor.

<HEAD>C&amp;P Telephone Suspended in Long-Running Contract Competition With
A&amp;T</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Company and
its parent company have been suspended from signing new contracts
with the federal government on grounds C&amp;P sales people made false
statements about whether the kind of telephones they proposed to
install for the Treasury Department were already in wide use.
   Treasury officials said the statements were made during recent
negotiations over a disputed contract in which American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. is competing with C&amp;P and, by extension, its parent
Bell Atlantic Corp.
   The agency invoked a federal law that allows any agency to hold
up contract awards from any other federal agency pending resolution
of the dispute.
   In fiscal 1989, 585 individuals or companies were suspended from
receiving new contracts under the regulations Treasury applied to
C&amp;P and Bell Atlantic.
   The current ruling does not affect federal contracts already
signed by C&amp;P and Bell Atlantic, including one under which C&amp;P is
to begin switching on a private phone network for federal offices
in the Washington area, a job that is estimated to be worth about
$220 million to $280 million over 10 years.
   However, it would put on hold C&amp;P's pending bid for a major
Defense Department telephone contract known as Tempo.
   The claims center on whether telephones C&amp;P proposes to use on
the Treasury job are available commercially. Federal contracting
procedures normally require that items bought by the government be
market-tested so it is not saddled with new, unproven equipment.
   In a statement issued Friday in response to the Treasury action,
Bell Atlantic officials called the suspension ``an abuse of
authority and a subversion of the government's own bidding
process.'' The company accused low-level employees at the Treasury
of trying to award AT&amp;T contract worth about $90 million to provide
a 20,000-line telephone system for 16 Treasury locations in the
district.
   Twice since 1987, Treasury has awarded the contract in question
to AT&amp;T only to have C&amp;P win appeals to the General Services
Administration's Board of Contract Appeals.
   ``C&amp;P will not be harassed out of this competition,'' Tony
Murray, Bell Atlantic federal systems division vice president, said
Friday. The company said it will challenge the Treasury's move.
   AT&amp;T has not commented on the latest development.
   C&amp;P provides local telephone service to the metropolitan
Washington area and is owned by Bell Atlantic, a Philadelphia-based
regional telephone company.

   The pistol Teddy Roosevelt carried in his
charge up San Juan Hill has been stolen, officials said Saturday.
   The .45-caliber Colt revolver was discovered missing from
Sagamore Hill, the Long Island home of the nation's 26th president,
which is run as a museum by the National Park Service.
   Chief Ranger Ray Bloomer, who is blind, noticed Saturday that
the exhibit case that contained the gun was loose, and summoned a
sighted Park Service investigator. Nothing else was missing from
the case, which also contained Roosevelt's Rough Riders uniform,
hat and gloves.
   It appeared someone forced open a door to the case Thursday or
Friday, Bloomer said. Fifty to 100 visitors pass through on an
average day.
   The pistol, now valued at $500,000, was given to Roosevelt after
it was recovered from the battleship Maine, whose sinking in Havana
Harbor in 1898 led to the United States' declaration of war against
Spain.
   The gun's blued barrel is inscribed with the words, ``July 1,
1898, San Juan, carried and used by Col. Theodore Roosevelt,'' and
``From the sunken battleship MAINE.''
   Roosevelt killed at least one enemy soldier with the gun during
the charge up San Juan Hill that gave the U.S. Army control of the
hills overlooking Havana and Roosevelt his reputation as a national
hero, Bloomer said. The only other weapon he carried during the
charge was his sword.
   The inscription should make it difficult to sell at its
estimated value of $500,000, said Park Service spokeswoman Edie
Shean-Hammond.
   Roosevelt became president after William McKinley was
assassinated in 1901 and served until 1909.

<HEAD>Report: Soviets Reject U.S. Missile Ban Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States last month secretly proposed a
ban on some land-based missiles with multiple nuclear warheads but
the Soviet Union said the plan was too limited, according to a
published report.
   The New York Times reported in its Sunday editions that Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev responded to the proposal last week,
complaining that it excluded submarine-based ballistic missiles.
   A letter containing Gorbachev's reply was delivered to President
Bush Friday by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, the
paper said, quoting administration officials it didn't name.
   The White House refused to confirm the offer or refusal, the
Times said.
   The offer signals an attempt by Bush to put his stamp on arms
reduction talks which thus far have followed proposals made during
the Reagan Administration, the Times said.
   The rejection of the proposal caught the White House by
surprise, the Times said, adding that Bush administration officials
believe the Soviet Union's tougher position reflects a move by
Soviet military officials to assert themselves.
   One unidentified White House official told the Times that
Secretary of State James Baker III first presented the proposal to
Shevardnadze last month in Namibia, where both were attending
independence ceremonies.
   The proposal would ban mobile land-based missiles with multiple
warheads, followed by the eventual elimination of all land-based
missiles with multiple warheads.
   Administration officials said Moscow showed little interest in
the first stage of the Bush plan, the Times reported.
   That first step, which could have been considered as part of the
strategic arms treaty being negotiated this year, would have
prevented the United States from deploying 10-warhead MX missiles
on rail cars. It would have forced Moscow to remove its 10-warhead
SS-24 missiles from railroad launchers and put them in stationary
silos.
   The United States bases more of its ballistic missile warheads
at sea, while the Soviet Union has most of its missiles on land.

<TEXT>
   Arthur B. Singer, a naturalist and painter whose
watercolors of state birds were affixed to hundreds of thousands of
letters mailed in the 1980s, died Saturday. He was 72.
   Singer died at his home in Jericho, on Long Island, of cancer of
the esophagus.
   The stamp series bearing Singer's paintings is believed to have
been the largest-selling special issue in the history of U.S.
postage. The Postal Service issued the stamps featuring the birds
and flowers of the 50 states in 1982.
   Singer, who graduated from the Cooper Union Art School in New
York in 1939, received its Augustus St. Gaudens Medal in 1962 after
750 of his paintings appeared in ``Birds of the World,'' the first
of many books he illustrated. Golden Press issued a new edition of
the book in 1983.
   He received the Hal Borland Award from the National Audubon
Society in 1985, on the 200th anniversary of Audubon's birth.
   Singer's youngest son, Alan, painted the wildflowers that
appeared on the 1982 postage stamps.
   He also is survived by another son, Paul; his second wife, Dale
Singer, and two grandchildren.

said Saturday.
   Police moved in early in the day and arrested 30 people. Half
belonged to Mrs. Bhutto's party, and half were from militant Altaf
Hussein's Indian immigrant movement.
   Police said marauding gunmen killed three people late Saturday
afternoon and wounded 10 more, bringing to death toll to 17 and the
wounded to 55.
   The assailants began racing through this southern city's central
district after sunset Friday, firing at bystanders, police said.
The shooting ended around sunrise, but it broke out briefly late
Saturday afternnon, police said.
   Police arrested four members of Ms. Bhutto's party after a wild
car chase through the congested streets of Pakistan's largest city.
Among those detained was the president of the party's student wing.
   Hussein blamed Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party for the
killings.
   ``It is the PPP, with the patronage of the government, that has
unleashed the terrorists ....'' said Hussein. He told a news
conference he would start a hunger strike Sunday if his supporters
are not released and the ``real murderers'' are not arrested.
   Karachi, once a peaceful, affluent city of 8 million, has become
a battleground, with political parties and rival ethnic groups
fighting pitched battles in alleyways. Kidnappings and torture are
commonplace.
   Ms. Bhutto's left-of-center party and the Hussein's right-wing
Mohajir Qami Movement are the main combatants in the political
battle.
   The Indian movement once was an ally of Ms. Bhutto, but it
withdrew its support in November when it committed its 14 National
Assembly seats to her opposition. The opposition then called a
no-confidence vote, which she narrowly survived.
   Ms. Bhutto's party governs the 237-seat National Assembly.
   More than 60 people have been gunned down in the last month in
Karachi, according to police and relief organizations.

<TEXT>
   Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter was regarded
throughout his Navy career as the consummate military aide, a
perfect man to carry out orders with a preciseness that bordered on
brilliance.
   Yet he emerged as a national security adviser who would tell
skeptical congressional committees investigating the Iran-Contra
affair that ``the buck stops here with me'' with regard to the
decision to divert to the Central American Contras money made from
arms sales to Iran.
   A man once decorated for his efficiency in handling paperwork,
Poindexter was convicted Saturday of felony charges that make the
53-year-old officer liable for a potential 25-year prison term. One
of the charges: tearing up paperwork.
   When the jury decision was read _ indictment-by-indictment,
guilty verdict-by-guilty verdict _ the career military man stood at
attention before the bench, rocking forward every so slightly as
the count was rendered.
   His wife, an Episcopal priest, sat stoically beside the chief
defense lawyer's wife. Mrs. Poindexter remained still, showing no
emotion until it was over. Then she inclined her head every so
slightly on the other woman's shoulder an sighed quietly.
   Linda and John Poindexter, both from Indiana, were married in
1958, two days after he finished first in his class at the U.S.
Naval Academy at Annapolis. He was also brigade commander, one of
only about a half-dozen men this century to graduate No. 1 in both
academics and leadership.
   For 20 years she devoted her time to raising the couple's five
boys and, when they started to leave home, began studying for the
ministry.
   Poindexter went on to earn a doctorate in nuclear physics and
was on the Navy fast track in 1981 when he was tapped to become
military aide to former President Reagan's first National Security
Adviser, Richard V. Allen.
   When Allen was replaced by William P. Clark Jr., Poindexter
stayed in the same role and subsequently was a deputy to NSC
director Robert C. McFarlane.
   When McFarlane left, Poindexter moved into the top NSC job, and
right into the Iran-Contra caldron that was already swirling _ much
of it around Oliver North, a Marine lieutenant colonel with a
natural flair for theatrics who was to emerge as a well known
national figure, a hero to some and a big drawing card at
conservative fund-raisers.
   By contrast, the jurors who were to convict Poindexter indicated
in their responses to questions during jury selection that his name
_ let alone details of the charges against him _ barely registered
on their mental radar screens.
   Poindexter has declined to give interviews since being
implicated publicly in the affair, but interviews with friends,
colleagues, and some in Congress and elsewhere who are not
necessarily fond of the admiral have painted an almost universal
picture of a man more versed in the scientific and military
pursuits than politics and public relations.
   In particular, it was said that he never masted the art of
dealing with Congress, or with the press.
   As an NCS aide in 1985, he was credited within the inner circles
of the White House with planning and supervising the bold midair
interception of the plane carrying the hijackers of the Achille
Lauro and diverting the plane to Italy.
   Although unknown to the public at the time, Reagan is reported
to have said, ``I salute the admiral'' when he walked into the
morning NSC briefing the next day.
   ``He wasn't the kind of officer who would do something without
authority,'' Adm. Daniel J. Murphy, chief of staff to then-Vice
President Bush from 1981 to 1985, said of Poindexter in an
interview more than three years ago.
   Yet it was the same Poindexter who told an inquiring
congressional panel: ``The buck stops here with me. I made the
decision (to divert arms sale money to the Contras). I thought I
had the authority to do it. I thought it was a good idea. I was
convinced the president would, in the end, think it was a good
idea. But I did not want him to be associated with the decision.''

<HEAD>Mubarak Talks to Saddam on Chemical Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt arrived on
an unannounced visit Saturday and met with President Saddam Hussein
to discuss the Iraqi leader's pledge to use chemical arms if
attacked by Israel, officials said.
   Mubarak's visit apparently was intended to reduce tensions
between Iraq and the United States, who have exchanged criticisms
over Saddam's declaration Monday that his country possessed
chemical weapons and would destroy ``half of Israel'' if attacked.
   The officials said the two leaders met privately soon after
Mubarak's Egypt Air Boeing 747 landed in the late afternoon. After
a banquet at the presidential palace honoring Mubarak, the two met
again, joined by their senior aides.
   The banquet was iftar, the meal to break the dawn-to-dusk fast
that devout Moslems practice during the month of Ramadan.
   Mubarak was accompanied by Foreign Minister Esmat Abdul Meguid,
Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif and Foreign Undersecretary
Osama Al-Baz.
   Sharif told Egyptian reporters that the talks, which touched on
Arab and bilateral issues, were ``very cordial and were held in a
positive atmosphere.'' But he disclosed no details.
   Before flying to Baghdad, Mubarak was quoted by the state-run
Middle East News Agency as saying that Iraq had no plans to attack
Israel, but was reacting to a campaign of pressure against it.
   ``The Iraqi president has no intention of going to war at all.
Not with Israel and not with Iran,'' Mubarak said in remarks Friday.
   Iran and Iraq declared a truce in their eight-year war in 1988.
   Egyptain Embassy officials said Mubarak was to return to Cairo
later Saturday.
   The United States and Iraq have also been at odds over the
chemical weapons issue and also over a joint U.S-British
intelligence operation that arrested five people in London for
attempting to smuggle detonators for nuclear weapons to Iraq.
   Earlier Saturday, Saddam rejected a call by President Bush that
Iraq rule out using chemical weapons, banned by a 1925
international agreement.
   In Washington, the State Department announced it had expelled an
Iraqi diplomat at the United Nations because of his suspected role
in a purported murder plot against two opponents of the Baghdad
regime.
   The diplomat, who was not identified, was ousted for ``an abuse
of his privileges of residence in the United States,'' department
spokeswoman Anita Stockman said.

   The Palestinian guerrilla group of
terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal on Saturday appealed for the release
of two Swiss Red Cross hostages kidnapped in Lebanon.
   Police have said Abu Nidal's own group was the prime suspect in
the abduction of the two Swiss workers in Sidon on Oct. 6, but the
group has denied any responsibility.
   On Friday, the Council said preparations were under way to free
at least three French and Belgian hostages it holds in response to
an appeal from Libya leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   Saturday's statement signed by Fatah-Revolutionary Council
spokesman Mansour Hamdan said: ``In these moments when arrangements
are under way to release some hostages and captives, I issue this
brotherly appeal to the side that kidnapped Elio Erriquez and
Emmanuel Christen, the two Swiss workers for one of the
International Red Cross centers in Lebanon, ... to solve this
problem.''
   The typewritten Arabic-language statement said the group was
ready ``to provide all the guarantees demanded by the kidnappers to
solve this tragedy.''
   The statement did not identify the kidnappers or say what
guarantees might be involved.
   It said the offer was made ``in favor of the relationship
between our (Palestinian) people and the Swiss people and
government.''
   Abu Nidal is backed by Libya and believed to be living in
Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
    Erriquez, 23, and Christen, 33, are among 18 Western hostages
held captive in Lebanon. Associated Press chief Middle East
correspondent Terry Anderson is the longest held hostage. He was
abducted on March 16, 1985.
   Erriquez and Christen were kidnapped outside the Red Cross
orthopedic center in Sidon, where they helped fit artificial limbs
for victims of Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war.

   President-elect Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro says top Sandinista military officers must go once she
takes office at the end of April.
   In the announcement Friday night, Mrs. Chamorro said among those
to be retired are the nine Commanders of the Revolution, who led
the leftist Sandinista Front for National Liberation to victory
over dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979.
   Among them are Gen. Humberto Ortega, the defense minister and
brother of outgoing President Daniel Ortega, and Interior Minister
Tomas Borge, who is in charge of the ruling Sandinistas' security
police.
   ``I am certain (Gen. Ortega) will not form part of my
government,'' Mrs. Chamorro said. ``He will not remain in the army
either.''
   Mrs. Chamorro also wants more than a dozen senior officers who
played prominent roles in Sandinista affairs to step down.
   The announcement was made to La Prensa newspaper reporters, who
briefly interviewed Mrs. Chamorro while she was visiting with Costa
Rican President-elect Rafael Calderon Fournier.
   Mrs. Chamorro is publisher of La Prensa, which dogged the
Sandinistas for years as the only opposition newspaper.
   Nicaragua's president-elect led the opposition to a landslide
election victory Feb. 25. She is to take power April 25.

   Allegations of drug use continued to agitate the
Democratic gubernatorial contenders on Saturday, as a new poll
found Tuesday's runoff too close to call.
   The runoff pits state Attorney General Jim Mattox against state
Treasurer Ann Richards. The winning Democrat will face Republican
Clayton Williams in the general election.
   A poll for the Houston Chronicle and The Dallas Morning News
showed Ms. Richards backed by 44 percent of Democrats who said they
planned to vote Tuesday. Mattox had 38 percent, 16 percent were
undecided and 3 percent didn't support either candidate, according
to the poll published in the papers' Sunday editions.
   The poll of 759 Democrats was conducted last week by the Center
for Public Policy at the University of Houston. It had a margin of
error of 4 percentage points.
   Mattox, who made a political issue of Ms. Richards' refusal to
answer questions about alleged drug use more than 10 years ago, on
Saturday found himself again fending off allegations that he smoked
marijuana in the 1970s.
   ``Jim Mattox has never used any kind of dangerous drug ever,''
the state attorney general said in Houston.
   A Houston lawyer and a former Dallas police officer told
newspapers on Thursday they saw Mattox smoke marijuana on separate
occasions in the 1970s. Then, on Friday, an Austin barber told TV
stations that he smoked marijuana with Mattox in Dallas about 20
years ago.
   Mattox blamed the campaign staff of Ms. Richards, the state
treasurer, for planting the allegations with news organizations.
   ``I believe it's totally fabricated by the Richards campaign,''
he said. Even if Ms. Richards didn't personally talk to those
accusing him of using marijuana, Mattox said, ``She's absolutely
responsible for what took place.''
   Ms. Richards' press secretary, Monte Williams, denied Mattox's
claim, and said no one in the Richards campaign knows the men
making the accusations.
   ``We think on Tuesday that the voters are going to reject his
negative campaigning,'' Williams said.
   Williams, the Republican nominee, on Saturday made an issue for
the first time of the row over drugs.
   ``If those Democrats keep doing drugs, I'm going to teach them
the joys of busting rocks _ both of them,'' Williams said in
Dallas, making light of one of his commercials.
   But he added, ``I probably won't need to, as bad as they are
whipping up on each other.''
   Ms. Richards has repeatedly answered the question of drug use by
saying she has not used a ``mood-altering'' drug since leaving a
rehabilitation program for alcoholism 10 years ago.
   The issue has dominated the Democratic runoff, forced after Ms.
Richards finished the March 13 primary with 39 percent of the vote,
to Mattox' 37 percent.

   Gorky Park, a Soviet rock ``superband'' that
plays to big crowds in its homeland but small clubs on its first
American tour, appeared before 45,000 people Saturday at Farm Aid
IV.
   ``We're not worried, we're just nervous a little bit,''
guitarist Ian Ianenkov said during a news conference before the
show at the Hoosier Dome.
   Members of the four-man band also brainstormed about doing their
own Farm Aid concert in the Soviet Union.
   ``We want to do the same kind of concert in Russia and invite
everyone to play,'' lead guitarist Alexei Belov said.
   The band urged changes in U.S. agriculture policies, warning
that American farms are becoming more like the huge farming
cooperatives formed 70 years ago in the Soviet Union.
   ``First they chased all the farmers off the land and then they
made big cooperatives, big state farms. It didn't work,'' said
Belov. ``I don't think you would want in America for it to go like
this.''
   Gorky Park, whose members are culled from some of the most
popular Soviet bands, regularly attract sellout crowds at home but
have drawn mostly small, curious club crowds during the U.S. tour.
   The group, nurtured by Jon Bon Jovi and invited to Farm Aid by
John Mellencamp, was among the few foreign performers in the
all-star benefit's lineup.

   Former national security adviser John
Poindexter was convicted Saturday of conspiracy, obstruction and
lying to Congress in the Iran-Contra scandal, which marred the last
two years of Ronald Reagan's presidency.
   A federal court jury found Poindexter guilty on all five felony
charges against him. He could face up to 25 years in prison and
$1.25 million in fines when he is sentenced June 11.
   Poindexter's lawyers said they would appeal.
   In reaching the verdict, jurors rejected Reagan's claim in
videotaped testimony that no crimes were committed in his
administration's secret arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits
to help the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   ``President Reagan was wrong and incorrect,'' said prosecutor
Dan Webb, noting the earlier conviction of Poindexter's former aide
Oliver North.
   Poindexter, 53, had appeared confident as he walked into the
courtroom shortly after noon on the sixth day of jury
deliberations. He stood facing the jurors as the 25-year-old
foreman, Wayne Mitchell, rose to his feet to read the verdicts.
   ``Guilty,'' Mitchell said as the clerk read each of the five
criminal charges aloud.
   There was silence in the courtroom as the first verdict was
returned and then a murmur as Mitchell continued to read guilty
verdicts on each of the five counts.
   The foreman was quoted later as saying Reagan's testimony had
little impact on the jurors' verdict.
   ``Mr. Reagan's testimony didn't play any more of an important
role than any other testimony,'' Mitchell told Washington Post
reporters in an interview at his apartment. ``Actually he didn't
give much information.''
   Mitchell said he viewed North's testimony, considered by
prosecutors to be damaging to Poindexter, as coming from a witness
who `was there trying to protect himself.''
   ``To me, Oliver North was a soldier,'' Mitchell said. ``Of
course, I didn't figure he would come in there and tell lies
against his superiors. I saw he was there for protection of
himself, rather than Mr. Poindexter.''
   The jury foreman said of Poindexter: ``All in all, I think he
was very dedicated. But guilty as charged.''
   Did the jurors consider Reagan ultimately responsible for the
Iran-Contra case?
   ``That's dynamite,'' Mitchell said. ``I would rather not answer
that.''
   Webb said the prosecution team would meet in the next two weeks
to make a sentencing recommendation to U.S. District Court Judge
Harold Greene.
   Poindexter's conviction ``marks the end of a very difficult and
very important trial in American history,'' he said.
   ``High men in government office who have the responsibility for
the security of this nation ought not to be allowed to commit
crimes to pursue their own self-interest,'' Webb said.
   Poindexter is the third top Reagan administration figure
convicted in the scandal. The others, North and former national
security adviser Robert McFarlane, have not served any jail time.
North was convicted in a jury trial and McFarlane pleaded guilty.
   Poindexter was convicted of conspiring with North, businessman
Richard Secord and others to conceal the truth about Iran-Contra
from Congress.
   In an interview, Webb said the ``others'' included CIA Director
William Casey and McFarlane.
   Along with North, Secord and Poindexter, ``those are clearly the
people we established are the most deeply involved in this
conspiracy,'' said Webb.
   Casey told the House intelligence committee on Nov. 21, 1986
that there had been no presidential finding approving the Hawks
shipment, U.S. Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., testified at the trial of
Poindexter.
   Specifically, Poindexter was accused of covering up North's
secret Contra resupply network and the U.S. role in a CIA-assisted
shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran in November 1985.
   North's Contra military assistance operation took place during a
congressional aid ban that required the CIA to withdraw military
support for the rebel force. The Hawks shipment was ratified by a
politically embarrassing presidential document that depicted the
missile delivery as a swap of arms for hostages.
   Poindexter tore up the document Nov. 21, 1986, hours after
telling Congress that Reagan hadn't approved the shipment. On Nov.
13, 1986, Reagan had told the nation in a televised address that
``we did not ... trade weapons'' for hostages.
   Poindexter said nothing as he left the U.S. Courthouse. A
reporter asked whether he had any second thoughts about not taking
the witness stand in his own defense.
   ``No second thoughts,'' responded Poindexter's wife, Linda, who
was at her husband's side.
   ``We're naturally disappointed with the verdict in this case,
but we're going to appeal it and we're going to keep fighting it as
hard as we can,'' defense attorney Richard Beckler said.
   During the five-week trial, Poindexter's attorneys suggested
that his actions were aimed at protecting the president.
   ``Even being charitable to Admiral Poindexter, he did it because
he wanted to protect the political viability of Ronald Reagan, and
I consider that to be self-interest,'' Webb said. ``People do not
commit crimes to protect the public good.''
   Webb said a decision on whether prosecutors will recommend that
Poindexter be given jail time will be made in consultation with
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, whose office has been
investigating the Iran-Contra scandal since December 1986.
   North's secret Contra operation was set up in 1984 as Congress
was cutting off U.S. military aid to the rebel force.
   The CIA-assisted shipment of Hawk missiles was approved by
Reagan after it actually took place. The approval came in a
so-called ``finding'' signed by Reagan.
   The finding depicted the administration as trading arms for
hostages, something Reagan had said he would never do.
   In addition to tearing up the finding, Poindexter deleted 5,000
computer messages in his final days on the job. His defense was
that employees leaving the government were encouraged to purge
their computer files. Prosecutors said he was trying to cover up
his lies to Congress.
   Poindexter told Congress he didn't find out about the Hawks
delivery until five weeks after it occurred and that he hadn't
realized other U.S. officials might have known about the shipment
ahead of time.
   Prosecutors said the misstatements were designed to avoid
raising questions about the politically embarrassing finding.
   Beckler said the misstatements resulted from an imperfect memory
and were not an attempt to cover up.
   Poindexter ``supposedly found out'' at the end of November about
the Hawks shipment rather than in January and ``that is no big deal
... that is a five-week mistake,'' Beckler told the jury in final
arguments. ``Considering all he had to do, it's not too bad that he
only missed by five weeks.''
   The national security adviser ``was the man in charge'' of the
U.S. role in the Hawks shipment, responded Iran-Contra prosecutor
Howard Pearl.

<HEAD>Fourth Body Found In Wreckage Of Miami Beach Hotel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A fourth body was found Saturday as
authorities continued a top-to-bottom search of the wreckage of a
hotel that was swept by fire as residents slept.
   Ten tenants were still unaccounted-for in the fire that hit the
Fontana Hotel before dawn Friday.
   ``We believe there are more victims inside,'' said police Capt.
Rocco DeLeo. ``What we are doing is getting details from relatives
of people who we believe are missing and getting the physical
characteristics of these persons.''
   One hundred and one of the 102 rooms were rented out, but no one
is sure exactly how many people were in the hotel at the time of
the fire, said Olimpia Mihai, one of the Fontana's owner-managers.
Estimates of the number of inhabitants has ranged up to 150; the
registration records were burned in the fire.
   As federal, state and city teams launched a top-to-bottom
search, a crane was brought in to help pick apart the gutted ruins
of the hotel.
   Investigators broke off their search at sundown Saturday and
planned to return Sunday morning with specially trained dogs to
search for bodies, said Miami Beach police Detective Jim Hyde.
   With the cause still a mystery, U.S. Magistrate Linnea Johnson
issued a search warrant at the request of the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to preserve any evidence that might
be needed later in court. The bureau conducts arson investigations.
   Mayor Alex Daoud said fire officials told him Friday that arson
was strongly suspected, but Fire Chief Branaird Dorris said tenants
had mentioned a water leak, which raised the possibility of an
electrical short.
   ``Whenever you have a serious loss of life, and a substantial
loss of property damage and money, a warrant is routine,'' Hyde
said Saturday.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen, who donned a hard hat to inspect
the three-story hotel, said the purpose of the warrant was to
legally preserve any possible evidence.
   He played down the significance of his visit, saying: ``You
shouldn't judge the importance of any particular investigation by
what officials are there.''
   Asked when the death toll would be known, Robert Creighton, ATF
agent in charge of the Florida office, said: ``We may have that in
two days. It all depends on what we find.''
   Names of 14 residents who had not been seen since the fire were
provided by surviving tenants.
   The four bodies found so far _ two women, a man and a fourth
person whose sex wasn't immediately determined _ were tentatively
assumed to be among the 14 missing, Hyde said.
   ``We're bringing our total of unaccounted-for people to ten,''
Hyde said. ``Again, this is an approximate `guesstimate' based on
information we were given by residents of the hotel.''
   Twenty-one hotel residents were taken to three area hospitals
Friday, and five remained hospitalized in good condition Saturday.

<HEAD>Inquiry Demanded in Alleged Kidnapped of American Nun</HEAD>

   A Roman Catholic delegation demanded an
investigation into the alleged abduction, torture and sexual abuse
by government agents of an American nun.
   ``The government has tried to hide the truth in this case,''
said Sister Francisco Wilhelm at a news conference on Friday.
   Some Guatemalan officials have alleged that the kidnapping of
31-year-old Sister Diana Mack Ortiz of Colorado was self-inflicted.
   ``This version of a hoax is ridiculous,'' said Sister Wilhelm.
She cited a Nov. 8, 1989, report by an New Mexico medical group
which said the nun had suffered second-degree burns.
   Sister Wilhelm, who was accompanied by Guatemalan and American
church officials, said Sister Ortiz has returned to the Ursulina
order headquarters in Maple Mount, Ky.
   Sister Ortiz was abducted Nov. 2, 1989, in Antigua, 30 miles
west of the Guatemala City, and released later that day, Sister
Wilhelm said.
   The Americans were is in Guatemala to press the government for
an investigation. The members said they personally would ask
President Vinicio Cerezo to form a commission to investigate the
matter.
   ``We know and Gen. Carlos Morales, the security minister, has
admitted that there are thousands of cases like Diana's in
Guatemala,'' Sister Wilhelm said. ``By the grace of God she was
freed.''
   Pablo Sireff, an attorney for Sister Ortiz, said his client was
abducted by uniformed officers and taken away in a police car.
   The church delegation said she was taken to Mixco, a small town
outside Antigua, where she was sexually molested and burned. It
said the nun was interrogated and shown photographs of people to
identify.
   However, it had no explanation for any reason the nun would be
abducted.

   The owner of the building that housed an illegal
social club where 87 people were killed in a fire has been accused
in lawsuits by his brother and sister of ruining the family real
estate business.
   The Daily News and The New York Times reported in their Sunday
editions that the siblings of Alex DiLorenzo III accuse him of
making speculative commodities investments, buying failing
businesses and acquired buildings in need of repairs.
   Alex DiLorenzo last week surrendered to authorities on 43 arrest
warrants for outstanding building code violations, including one
violation at the Happy Land social club in the Bronx, where the
fire occurred last month. The other 42 concerned citations at
various Manhattan properties.
   DiLorenzo's brother, Marc, and sister, Lisa, sued to wrest
control of two family partnerships which have about 250 holdings
valued in court papers at as much as $1.2 billion, the Times said.
   At the family's request, the pending case has been sealed.
   In one decision before the sealing, Manhattan state Supreme
Court Justice Harold Baer credited Alex DiLorenzo with increasing
the success of the family business. Baer in December rejected Marc
DiLorenzo's motion to have Alex removed as head of the business.
   Among the non-real estate transactions questioned in the
lawsuit, the News said, was Alex DiLorenzo's involvement in a firm
that began to sell frozen cow embryos and bull semen to Third World
countries.
   Five brokers who have worked with the DiLorenzo family said Alex
failed to follow his late father's pattern of buying established,
expensive properties, the Times said.
   The DiLorenzo business was left in trust to the three children
when their father died in 1975. Alex DiLorenzo administered the
trust.
   Several years ago, Marc DiLorenzo, under terms allowed in the
trust, asked that the partnership be broken into three equal parts
and distributed. Alex DiLorenzo refused and his siblings sued.

   A grand jury indicted an arts center and its
director on obscenity charges Saturday for an exhibit of the late
Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs, including some with partly nude
children or homosexual acts.
   Despite the indictment, the controversial photos will remain in
the exhibit, said Dennis Barrie, director of the Contemporary Arts
Center.
   ``The show will continue,'' Barrie said of the exhibit, which
prompted debate last year in Congress over federal funding for the
arts when Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., objected to some of the photos.
   ``There is simply nothing wrong with this exhibition,'' Barrie
said. ``It's an important exhibition. It's important that it be
seen here.''
   Attorneys for the center planned to ask U.S. District Judge Carl
Rubin for a temporary restraining order Sunday barring the Hamilton
County prosecutor, the county sheriff and the Cincinnati police
chief from closing the show, center spokeswoman Amy Banister said
Saturday night.
   The Hamilton County grand jury indicted the arts center and
Barrie on two misdemeanor counts each of pandering obscenity and
illegally using a minor in nudity-oriented material after jurors
viewed the exhibition anonymously among the crowd Saturday. The
grand jury concluded that seven of the 175 photographs are obscene.
   The indictment touched off an emotional rally Saturday afternoon
by patrons who were ordered out of the center while police
videotaped the display under protection of a search warrant.
   ``The whole world is watching. The whole world is laughing,''
several hundred patrons chanted while they waited outside the
center.
   The crowd also gave Nazi salutes and shouted ``Sieg Heil'' to
officers videotaping the show.
   The show was reopened after police finished their videotaping in
about 45 minutes. No arrests were made.
   About 650 people saw the exhibit before it was closed for the
videotaping at midday; in all, more than 3,000 people paid $5 each
on Saturday to view the exhibit, easily breaking the center's
attendance record for an opening day, Ms. Banister said.
   The center's largest previous opening-day crowd was 1,000 in
late 1988 for a show on computers and art, she said.
   Although police didn't confiscate any of the photographs
Saturday, Hamilton County Prosecutor Arthur Ney suggested further
action would be taken next week unless the pictures in question are
voluntarily removed. He said no action would be taken until Monday
or Tuesday.
   ``There's always a possibility that each day this continues
could be an added criminal action or sanction,'' Ney told a hastily
called news conference. ``I'm not saying there will be; I'm saying
there could be.''
   The arts center refused to admit people under 18 to the show
unless they were accompanied by parents. The center also put the
controversial photos in a separate display room.
   The exhibit opened to the public Saturday morning after an
evening preview showing that attracted more than 4,000 members of
the center.
   A demonstrator at a museum entrance Saturday held up a sign
reading ``Censorship is obscene.'' At another entrance, a sign
read, ``Stop pornography. Stop Perversion. Stop Mapplethorpe.''
   Amateur photographer John Daniels praised the photos and said
the controversy prompted him to attend the opening.
   ``It's embarrassing to be from Cincinnati with this kind of
reaction and be seen as a backward, jerkwater town,'' Daniels said.
``I hope that the turnout demonstrates that Cincinnati really is
enlightened.''
   The University of Pennsylvania's Institute of Contemporary Art
organized the exhibit in the fall of 1988. It drew large crowds in
Philadelphia in December 1988 and in Chicago at the time of
Mapplethorpe's March 1989 death from acquired immune deficiency
syndrome at age 42.
   Last June, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.,
canceled the exhibit. It drew large crowds at the Wadsworth
Atheneum in Hartford, Conn., in late 1989. The show runs through
May 26 in Cincinnati and closes its tour in Boston in August.
   The Washington exhibit prompted Congress to limit funds for the
arts after Helms, R-N.C., declared the photographs obscene.
   Barrie could be sentenced to up to one year in jail if convicted
on both charges. The maximum sentence for the arts center would be
a $10,000 fine.
   Lawyers for the city and county told a municipal court judge on
Friday that no decision had been made about whether the photos were
obscene. Ney said Saturday he considers them personally offensive
but that he would leave it to a jury to decide whether they are
obscene.
   Cincinnati Police Chief Lawrence Whalen said residents should be
content that the law has been followed in issuing the indictments.
   ``There are no raving Neanderthals running amok in the streets
of Cincinnati,'' Whalen said.

   A North Sea ferry with nearly 500 people
aboard caught fire before dawn Saturday, suffocating many
passengers who tried to flee down smoke-filled corridors. About 150
people were reported killed and at least 20 injured.
   The Danish owners of the car ferry said they strongly suspected
arson. Some passengers said the boat's fire alarms didn't work and
the crew seemed unprepared for the emergency.
   ``There were plenty of people aboard, and I guess they all tried
to leave at the same time,'' said Norwegian firefighter Sven-Johan
Svenson. ``Some of those who got left behind and died just didn't
find their way out.''
   Dr. Tom Brokopp, leader of a Swedish medical rescue team, told
reporters at the Swedish port of Lysekil that 75 bodies were
counted so far on the Scandinavian Star ferry and that 71 more were
dead or missing. He said some missing were still in the ship and
others were in the sea.
   However, assistant Oslo police commissioner Bjoern Gran told
Norwegian radio that the deaths would total about 150.
   ``We have been in contact with Swedish police, and they say
there were no more survivors on board,'' Gran said.
   In Oslo, Jan Erik Nermoen, representing the Danish VR-DANO Line
that owns the ship, said 493 passengers and crew were on a manifest.
   The ferry caught fire early Saturday after leaving Oslo en route
to the Danish port of Frederikshavn.
   Up to 340 people were reported rescued from lifeboats by
helicopters and about seven nearby vessels in the Skagerrak
Straits, 44 miles south of the Norwegian Ferder Island. More than
20 injured were taken to hospitals.
   The Swedish news agency TT said it was the worst ferry disaster
in Scandinavian waters.
   The fire was the worst North Sea ship disaster since March 6,
1987, when a car ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, capsized off
the Belgian port of Zeebrugge, killing 189 people. That accident
was blamed on ship personnel who failed to close bow doors,
allowing water to rush in.
   The Scandinavian Star, still burning and listing, was guided by
tugs to a dock in Lysekil port on Sweden's west coast Saturday
night, more than 18 hours after it caught fire. Much of the
midships section on the upper decks was blackened.
   More than 100 bodies remained aboard, district Police Chief Roar
Onso said, adding that they would not be removed before Sunday. He
said it would take several days to investigate the cause of the
fire.
   Most of the dead had apparently succumbed to smoke, and few were
seriously burned, said Conny Englund, head of the Swedish Sea
Rescue Center at Lysekil. Firemen who probed the blackened
compartments of the 10,000-ton ferry said they found three
passengers, alive and apparently uninjured, among the many bodies.
   ``We woke up in the middle of the night. I heard a noise
outside. I went out of the cabin and saw thick, black smoke,'' said
Danish passenger Leo Odeland, an Oslo resident traveling with his
wife and two daughters.
   ``Nothing happened when I pushed the fire alarm. I hadn't heard
the alarm go off. At another place where there was supposed to be
an alarm, nothing was there.''
   Odeland said the crew was ``apparently new and untrained.''
   ``It was hard to get the lifeboat into the water and then the
motor didn't start,'' he said, adding that the lifeboat drifted
away and a Soviet freighter picked them up.
   Brokopp quoted several passengers as saying alarms didn't work
and crew members had trouble understanding each other because they
spoke different languages.
   ``It was chaotic,'' said passenger Eli Kvale Neilsen. ``It was
clear that the crew was not trained for this kind of situation.''
   Passenger and crew lists were not immediately available, rescue
officials said, and this led to confusion about the numbers and
identities of those aboard the Scandinavian Star. The crew was
believed to be largely Portuguese, with Scandinavian officers.
   The Bahamian-registered ferry is owned by the Danish shipping
company VR-DANO Line. SeaEscape Ltd of Miami sold the ship to
VR-DANO last month, a SeaEscape spokeswoman said in a telephone
interview from Miami.
   Danish radio quoted Ole Hansen, managing director of the Danish
company, as saying he was virtually certain the fire had been
deliberately set aboard the ferry.
   Hansen, speaking at a news conference in Copenhagen, insisted
the vessel was safe, but he refused to discuss the reports that
alarms had not worked on the ferry and that the crew was untrained.
   Company officials said two fires broke out on separate decks
within 15 minutes. Crew members reportedly extinguished the first
fire, then discovered a bigger blaze one deck below.
   Scandinavian news reports quoted survivors as saying the fire
began on a low deck, beneath the ferry's water line and near the
stern. Thick smoke spread upward, through the deck where
passengers' cars were parked and through a higher deck where a
casino and bars are located.
   Maritime and police officials in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway
announced plans for a joint investigation. Gran told reporters that
the inquiry would be based on the theory that the fire had been
deliberately set.
   Anders Lindstrom, head of the Swedish Seafarers' Union, blamed
the fire on on shipping companies who register ships under flags of
convenience to escape regulations concerning crew hiring and safety.
   The Scandinavian Star's distress signal was sent about 2:30 a.m.
(8:30 p.m. EDT Friday). News reports quoted survivors as saying the
fire was already widespread at that time.
   Hansen denied a Swedish radio report that some passengers had
slept in their cars, a practice that could contribute to safety
hazards. The vessel has large doors at both ends to allow vehicles
to drive on and off.
   Niel Bagger, deputy director of the Danish Marine Authority,
told Danish TV that the Scandinavian Star started on the
Oslo-Frederikshavn route last week, and that Danish authorities had
not yet inspected the ferry.
   An engine-room fire broke out aboard the Scandinavian Star in
March, 1988, as it sailed from Cozumel, Mexico, to Tampa, Fla. None
of the 439 passengers, mostly Americans, was injured.
   The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the
ship's smoke-detectors apparently failed, an automatic
fire-extinguishing system did not work and emergency generators
didn't work for an hour after the fire. It also said the crew was
poorly trained for firefighting.

   North Carolina State University bought out
the contract of basketball coach Jim Valvano for $212,000 on
Saturday, ending a six-week fight by Valvano to keep his job.
   The university sought Valvano's ouster following reports that
former players had accepted cash from school boosters and
allegations of point-shaving on games. The point-shaving
allegations are still under investigation.
   Valvano was never implicated in the allegations, but they
followed a two-year probation imposed in 1989 by the National
Collegiate Athletic Association, which found players had improperly
sold complimentary basketball shoes and tickets.
   Valvano, who led N.C. State to a 209-114 record and the 1983
championship during his 10-year tenure, also had been criticized
for the lack of academic progress made by the players he recruited.
   ``There is no bitterness at all,'' Valvano said Saturday.
``There is nothing but joy in the last 10 years, even the last year
and a half.''
   Valvano maintained he likely would have prevailed in any lawsuit
over his departure, but he said it was not in the best interest of
the school to pursue legal action.
   ``I'm not trying to be a divisive force,'' he said. ``I'm trying
to be part of the solution.''
   Over the past five days, Valvano had tried to meet with the
school's Board of Trustees but was turned down. On Friday, he
proposed remaining for one more year for a salary of $1. That was
turned down as well.
   Valvano settled for double his annual salary of $106,000. He had
sought $500,000.
   Chancellor Larry K. Monteith said Valvano will also receive his
regular salary through May 15, a total of $26,509.24.
   ``We wish him well in his future endeavors,'' Monteith said.
``We believe firmly that this settlement is in the best interest of
our students, faculty, alumni and everyone associated with N.C.
State University.''

   Ronald E. Evans, who was Apollo 17 command
module pilot on man's last trip to the moon, died of a heart attack
at his Arizona home Saturday. He was 56.
   The former astronaut died in his sleep and was found by his
wife, Janet, his mother-in-law, Marge Pollom of Sun City, told the
The Topeka Capital-Journal.
   Evans called his December 1972 flight to the moon in Apollo 17
``the best experience I ever had in my life.''
   He left the astronaut program in 1977 to become an officer with
Western American Energy Corp. in Scottsdale, Ariz. He was in demand
as a public speaker and traveled widely.
   Evans was born in St. Francis, Kan., and later lived in Topeka,
Kan.
   He received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from
the University of Kansas in 1956, where he enrolled in the ROTC
program, and a master's degree in aeronautical engineering from the
U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1964. He was selected in 1963 for
astronaut training and became an astronaut in 1966.

   The Cuban Supreme Court on Friday rejected an
appeal by two human rights activists sentenced to prison for
criticizing a drug trial that led to the execution of four military
officers, a news report said.
   The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said the court upheld the
sentences handed down last November to Elizardo Sanchez Santa Cruz
and Hiram Abi Cobas Nunez.
   Both were convicted of crimes against the state.
   ``The intention of the accused was to impair the prestige of and
discredit the Cuban state and affect its relations with other
nations by propagating false and tendentious news,'' Prensa Latina,
monitored in Mexico City, quoted the Supreme Court as saying.
   Sanchez Santa Cruz received two years imprisonment and Cobas
Nunez 18 months.
   Prensa Latina said the two wrote a ``joint communique''
criticizing the court martial that convicted 14 military officers
of drug-trafficking, four of whom were executed in July.
   The statement said the court martial violated legal regulations
and rights of the accused, Prensa Latina said.
   Maj. Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, a war hero who fought with President
Fidel Castro in Cuba's revolution, and three fellow officers were
executed by firing squad in July for their involvement in the drug
trafficking scandal.
   Also executed were Col. Antonio de la Guardia Font, Maj. Amado
Pardo and Capt. Jorge Martinez.
   Ochoa had been a trusted aide to Castro, commanding Cuban forces
in Ethiopia and Angola and heading a Cuban military mission to
Nicaragua.
   The scandal stunned and embarrassed Castro and his communist
government, which for years denied U.S. accusations that Cuba was
being used to smuggle drugs into the United States.
   Another 10 officers were sentenced to prison terms, and the
scandal led to a major shakeup of the armed forces, the Interior
Ministry and the Cuba's state security force.

   The United States and the Soviet Union head
for a superpower summit in seven weeks still divided on major
nuclear arms control issues but hoping that more talks next month
will produce the ``hard decisions'' needed to weld agreement.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III did use three days of
meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze this
week to deliver repeated warnings of the consequences of employing
Moscow's military weight to crush Lithuania's fervor for
independence.
   And both nations took a new look at how a unified Germany will
fit into the European community, making no effort to disguise
fundamental differences on how that fit eventually will be made.
   Baker and Shevardnadze acted to lower expectations that
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev actually
will be able to sign a treaty sharply reducing intercontinental
nuclear weapons when they meet here beginning May 30.

   A moderate earthquake rattled the San

the teams that were about to start a World Series game at
Candlestick Park when last year's killer quake struck.
   The temblor, measuring 4.5 on the Richter scale, capped an
afteroon-long swarm of seismic activity that jangled nerves and
tossed merchandise from store shelves but caused no major damage or
injuries.
   The quake struck at 7:39 p.m., just one minute after the game
between the Oakland Athletics and the San Francisco Giants got
under way at Candlestick.
   ``In the press box everybody sort of sat up and said, `No, that
didn't happen. Did someone jump hard?''' said Bob Egelko, an

   Close to 6,000 people lined up Friday night and filed through

nine homoerotic or sadomasochistic photos among the 175 on display.
   ``This crowd says a lot about the people of Cincinnati and their

   President Bush says he will sign an executive
order that he earlier promised _ and in fact claimed to have issued
_ protecting Chinese students from deportation.
   Aides said Bush will release the order, probably early next
week, incorporating provisions of an informal directive he had
issued on dealing with Chinese who feared for their safety if sent
home when their visas expired. Many had supported the
now-suppressed democracy movement.
   The president said his order also will ``extend the deferral of
enforced departure for Chinese nationals, which is currently
scheduled to expire on June 5 of this year, through Jan. 1, 1994.''
   Reacting to criticism that he has failed to issue the executive
order he promised last year, Bush said Friday: ``I did say I was
going to have an executive order. What we had was an executive
directive from the president'' that had ``precisely the same legal
effect as an executive order.''

   Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. says the
Internal Revenue Service is firmly committed to safeguarding
taxpayers' rights, but critics say the word has not filtered down
to some agents in the field.
   David Keating, executive vice president of the National
Taxpayers Union, told a Senate Finance subcommittee Friday that the
situation could get worse as budget shortages increase pressure on
the IRS to boost collections.
   ``As marching orders filter through the bureaucracy, each
management layer tends to rewrite the orders stronger, to ensure

said.
   ``The result may well be that IRS employees could take a much
tougher stand with taxpayers, causing more violations of the

   It's known by NASA as the ``Phantom
Head,'' a human skull filled with sensors to measure the dose of
space radiation that astronauts receive.
   The skull goes into space aboard the shuttle Discovery for the
third and probably last time Tuesday. Its keeper in orbit,
astronaut Kathryn Sullivan, hopes the trip will put an end to all
jokes about the ``phantom passenger.''
   ``It's not a passenger. It's a device, actually a very
sophisticated one and one that has considerable potential to
provide some very significant data to all of the people within NASA
who are trying to measure crew health,'' she said.
   The head is crammed with instruments that bring its weight to
more than 20 pounds, and covered with a black plastic material
simulating human skin. It contains as many as 600 tiny measuring
devices called dosimeters.

<HEAD>Avi-Abed, Simha, Jill: Tragedy Where Identity Was Everything</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAROLD ROSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Simha Vaknin's boyfriend, a tall, handsome man,
was known to everyone in her town of Pardes Hanna as Avi Levy, a
Jew from Zicharon Yaacov, five miles away.
   In Zicharon Yaacov, where he had lived for 20 years, ``Avi'' was
Abed al-Tiar, a member of the town's only Arab family.
   Tiar wanted to be a Jew, and when his masquerade was exposed
last month, his hopes of escaping the limitations of being Arab in
Israel collapsed.
   Police said he fatally shot Simha and Jill Eden, a Jewish woman
from his own village who had rejected him, then took his own life.
   The case illuminates the element of identity that has
exacerbated the decades-long political conflict between Arab and
Jew.
   Intermarriages are not accepted by either community. There are
only a few hundred in Israel, a nation of 3.5 million Jews and
810,000 Arabs.
   Yochanan Peres, a sociology professor at Tel Aviv University,
said the taboo against marrying outside the group is so strong that
the few violators are put in ``a suicidal situation.''
   Abed al-Tiar seemed able to overcome the obstacles if anyone
could.
   Residents of Zicharon Yaacov describe the 23-year-old farm
worker as appearing Jewish in every way _ education, dress,
flawless Hebrew, sense of humor and friendships. They say he was
happy and well-liked, and for most of his life stayed out of
trouble.
   Then, two years ago, Tiar fell in love with Jill Eden, a
30-year-old beautician in his hometown.
   She was friendly, but did not reciprocate romantic interest, and
he began to press her.
   Yitzhak Zur, police commander of the town in northern Israel,
said Tiar wrote love letters to Ms. Eden and painted messages on a
wall near her house.
   He began threatening her a year ago, and Ms. Eden complained to
the police. Tiar was convicted of harassment and released on
probation.
   A few months later, Tiar met Simha Vaknin, 20, who worked at a
boarding school for retarded children in Pardes Hanna. He
introduced himself as Avi Levy, a name as common in Hebrew as John
Smith in English.
   ``He would be here from first thing in the morning,'' said
Simha's brother, Yaacov. ``We knew him as a Jew in everything; he
never gave a single sign that would give him away.''
   Her brother said Simha never considered the possibility that
``Avi'' was not Jewish until the beginning of March, when she spoke
to his older sister and detected a slight Arab accent. Tiar allayed
her doubts by showing her a forged army identity card.
   While they sat in his car a week later, a policeman stopped for
a routine check of their identity cards. Police said they arrested
Tiar for possessing a counterfeit card and told Simha his true
identity.
   ``She decided from that moment to break it off,'' her brother
said. ``She told him very politely that he had lied to her this
whole time and she didn't want to continue their relationship.''
   If she had known ``Avi'' was an Arab, Simha never would have
become involved with him, Yaacov said.
   ``We're not interested in relationships like that,'' the brother
said. ``It's not natural. It's not healthy.''
   A few days later, Tiar arrived at the school where Simha worked.
Zur, the Zicharon Yaacov police commander, said the young man
persuaded her to get into his car, drove to the outskirts of Pardes
Hanna and shot her to death.
   Tiar then drove to Zicharon Yaacov and came upon Jill Eden
leaving work, followed her home and shot her to death as she was
entering her apartment, Zur said.
   That evening, in the orchard where he worked, Tiar wrote a
suicide note in Hebrew on a cardboard box and shot himself in the
head. Police would not disclose the note's contents, but the daily
Maariv quoted it as saying: ``They wouldn't let me live as Jew.''
   ``He told me he wanted to be a Jew,'' said Shai Zukerman, the
dead man's employer. ``He was born an Arab, but among the Arabs he
was a Jew, and among the Jews he was an Arab.''

<HEAD>Fears of Dry Weather Send Cocoa Prices Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Since last fall, the price of cocoa has risen $300 a ton off the
14-year low of $900, despite six consecutive seasons of surplus
production and record inventories.
   Analysts say there are several reasons for the upsurge,
including a concern the West African crop areas _ primarily the
Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Cameroon _ have received only a quarter of
their normal rainfall in the past two months.
   There also has been some warming of the central Pacific Ocean
off the coasts of Chile and Peru, a phenomenon that in the past has
caused dry spells and droughts in the cocoa growing areas of Brazil
and in West Africa.
   Political unrest in the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa
producer, also is providing a boost to prices.
   The cocoa market has been further boosted by a concern over the
availabilty of cocoa to processors, says Sandra Kaul, an analyst
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Ms. Kaul noted the activity in the market is taking place in
between two crops _ the main crop harvest takes place between
September and January and supplies have been sold out. The
secondary harvest begins next month.
   Because so little cocoa is available, producers have been less
inclined to protect themselves in the futures market, where they
could sell cocoa contracts and lock in prices now.
   Ms. Kaul added that against the background of concern about the
weather and political stability, the International Cocoa Agreement
has been extended for another two years, eliminating the prospect
that the agreement's 250,000 ton buffer stock of cocoa beans will
be released into the market.
   Judy Ganes, an analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York, said the
bullish cocoa market was somewhat of a surprise because most
traders had a bearish expectation of a soft market after years of
oversupply.
   One analyst, who asked not to be identified, said the technical
nature of the price rise is an indication traders are finding a way
to construe any bit of information about the crop as bullish.
   ``Certainly if it rains in West Africa or any of the (other)
cocoa growing regions, it's (the price surge) over,'' Ms. Ganes
said.

   Cattle and pork futures were mixed, with pork rising sharply

<BYLINE>Corporate Profits: Down Now, Better Later?
^By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock-market investors are bracing for a new
round of negative earnings news over the next few weeks as
corporations post results for the first quarter of 1990.
   But if the suspicions of some analysts prove correct, the gloomy
mood that has prevailed in the earnings outlook for most of the
past year could begin to brighten in the months ahead.
   Their hopes are based, to a great degree, on recent signs that
business activity is slowly pulling out of its recent slowdown,
apparently having staved off a full-scale recession.
   ``It is more likely than not that we are passing the low point
in corporate profits,'' asserts Michael Sherman, investment
strategist at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   In the last half of 1989, by Sherman's reckoning, operating
earnings for the companies that make up Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
composite index showed an average decline of 4 percent.
   Shearson estimates that the quarter ended March 31 will see a
5.7 percent drop from the like period last year, to be followed by
a 2 percent shortfall in the second quarter.
   But after that, the firm projects small gains in the third
quarter, perhaps quickly expanding to record levels as 1990 comes
to a close. If they follow such a script, profits could finish the
year with a small net gain over 1989.
   ``Corporate America has not thrown in the towel on 1990,'' says
Stephen Roach, economist at the investment banking firm of Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co.
   ``That's a bold assertion, to say the least, but one that draws
ample support from what is shaping up to be a pleasant surprise on
corporate profits.
   ``We have long maintained that a resilient American consumer
will provide solid support to the U.S. economy in 1990. And now it
seems as if the business sector will follow suit.''
   The prospective timing of any upswing in profits is the subject
of much disagreement. ``An earnings pickup will be delayed 'til
late 1990,'' argues Thomas Doerflinger at PaineWebber Inc.
   But for next year he projects a 13 percent improvement from 1990
levels. ``This forecast implies that the Fed will successfully
engineer an anti-inflationary `soft landing,''' he says.
   Despite such upbeat thoughts, the stock market managed only a
mixed showing in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials rose 9.91 to 2,717.12.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index slipped .07 to
186.78; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
fell 4.64 to 430.90, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was down .74 at 361.01.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 143.97 million shares a day,
against 132.31 million the week before.
   For the immediate future, one point of particular concern for
many analysts is earnings in the banking industry.
   Entangled as they are in many of the debt problems the economy
is grappling with _ ranging from junk bonds and Third World loans
to real estate _ the banks now face what looks like a long period
of exacting scrutiny by federal regulators looking into their
lending practices.
   ``We suspect that the President, the Treasury and the Federal
Reserve are going to have something to say about how this process
unfolds,'' observed Sherman.
   ``In the end, it is healthy that the office (of the Controller
of the Currency) is forcing banks to tighten up their lending
standards.
   ``However, the economic repercussions of these actions should be
controlled, and will be controlled, before they do major damage to
the total economy.''

<HEAD>Which Way Are Oil Prices Heading?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices are weakening, a decline traced to
rising OPEC production, seasonal slack demand and the notable
absence of any jolting events such as the Exxon Valdez spill that
helped traumatize the market last year.
   Nonetheless it appears unlikely that prices will fall
dramatically, and some analysts say the market is much more stable
than at any time in the recent past. If these trends persist,
motorists shouldn't see any sudden price changes in gasoline as the
summer driving season begins.
   Others, however, contend that the oil market in general is much
more vulnerable to disruptions now, partly because of the growing
integration of the world economy and some politically unstable
hotspots.
   If, for example, Soviet oilworkers went on strike, or chemical
warfare broke out in the Middle East, or another major spill fouled
the U.S. coast, the psychological impact could give the oil market
a serious case of nerves and force prices up sharply.
   Most of the oil-price decline this past week was attributed to
new evidence that suggests the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is aggressively producing oil in what has been a slack
demand period, between winter and summer, when most refiners
curtail operations.
   OPEC accounts for a growing chunk of world production and has
doubled its market share in the United States over the past four
years, from about 12 percent to nearly 25 percent.
   The price of West Texas Intermediate, the primary grade of U.S.
crude and a widely followed market barometer, finished the past
week at $19.15 per 42-gallon barrel, down more than $1 a barrel
from a week earlier and down about $4 from the beginning of this
year. Wholesale gasoline prices also dropped sharply. But some
strategists believe these declines won't last long.
   ``Right now it's perceived there isn't going to be a crash in
prices,'' said Kevin Lindemer, associate director of Cambridge
Energy Research Associates in Cambridge, Mass. ``We can expect a
little bit of price weakness, but I think this is something that's
typical for this time of the year.''
   It remains unclear why OPEC production is so intense. Oil
intelligence references that track the cartel's output estimate the
13 members are producing about 23.5 million barrels a day, which is
about the highest level in eight years. If that persists, a serious
price decline would seem inevitable.
   At the same time, however, much of that oil is getting soaked up
by industrialized areas of the world. Moreover, potential markets
that nobody thought existed a year ago _ the most notable example
is Eastern Europe _ could provide new sources of demand for OPEC
oil.
   Edward N. Krapels, president of Energy Security Analysis, a
Washington-based research concern that tracks prices worldwide,
said there's another wrinkle in the world oil equation _ the
difference between low-sulphur ``sweet'' crudes such as West Texas
Intermediate, and the higher-sulphur ``sour'' grades that span much
of what OPEC sells.
   The sour crudes are plentiful but require intense refining to
produce high-quality gasoline, while sweet crudes are much cheaper
to process. This is important because U.S. oil companies play a
major role in refining sour crudes and could use their leverage to
hold down prices charged by producers.
   ``We think West Texas Intermediate will stabilize at about $19
to $20 a barrel, but unfortunately for exporters, high-sulphur oil
will fall further,'' Krapels said, predicting less than $15 a
barrel for Dubai, a standard Middle East crude.
   ``So it's kind of a bifurcated view,'' he said. ``You expect the
price of the dirty stuff to be lower than the clean stuff. The
refiners are in a very strong negotiating position.''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The government-directed savings &amp; loan salvation effort took
several dramatic turns. Most notable were the record 30-year prison
sentence imposed on a failed Texas thrift's former executive
convicted of fraud; a congressional auditor prediction that the
bailout cost could hit $500 billion if the economy falters, more
than triple the amount the White House forecast last year; and
Senate approval of labor lawyer Timothy Ryan as top S&amp;L regulator,
nullifying a court decision that had threatened to derail the
entire rescue effort.
   _Japan and the United States agreed on a broad economic pact
designed to make it easier for foreigners to do business in Japan
and make American industry more competitive. The pact was hailed as
a major event in relations between the world's two largest
economies, but it remains unclear whether and when its effects will
be felt.
   _The long battle for control of United Airlines appeared to be
near an end. Directors of parent company UAL Corp. agreed to a
$4.38 billion takeover offer from employees, about $2.4 billion
less than a debt-financed acquisition proposal that collapsed a
half year ago.
   _General Motors Corp. named Robert Stempel as chairman and chief
executive to succeed Roger Smith when he retires in August. The
appointment of Stempel to take the helm of the nation's biggest
industrial company was expected, and many believe he will play a
more aggressive role in GM's car design and development than Smith,
who was widely criticized because of his accounting background.
