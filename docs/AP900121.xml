<HEAD>U.N. Human Rights Envoy Arrives In Iran For Probe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.N. delegation arrived in Tehran
Sunday to begin the first outside investigation into alleged human
rights abuses since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   The delegation's trip marks a significant breakthrough for human
rights campaigners who have long accused Iran of abuses. Thousands
of people reportedly have been executed since 1979.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, said the U.N. team was scheduled to meet several senior
Iranian officials but did not identify them.
   The mission is led by Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, the U.N. Human
Rights Commission's special envoy and an international law expert
from El Salvador.
   The U.N. investigation comes amid efforts by President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called pragmatists, to liberalize
society after a decade of rigid Moslem fundamentalism.
   Rafsanjani was elected July 28. He since has dumped prominent
radicals from senior government posts as part of his effort to
renew ties with the West and attract badly needed foreign
investment to revitalize Iran's moribund economy.
   Shortly after the U.N. team arrived, Tehran Radio reported that
the chief of Iran's judiciary, Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, told a
meeting of prison directors in Tehran that all inmates must be
treated ``with respect and in accordance to Islamic law.''
   It is not known how many people are behind bars in Iran.
Dissident groups claim thousands of political prisoners are held
without trial, languishing in appalling conditions and subjected to
torture.
   Tehran invited Galindo Pohl to visit Iran in November, ending a
longtime policy of barring foreign observers from checking its
human rights practices.
   The invitation was extended after Galindo Pohl produced an
interim report, based mainly on evidence from Iranian dissidents,
that abuses continued after Iran's revolutionary leader, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, died June 3.
   That report cited 1,700 people ``possibly executed'' and said
prisoners were flogged, whipped on the soles of their feet with
barbed wire, burned with cigarettes, sexually abused, locked up in
heated boxes and subjected to mock executions.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, said in its 1989 report that Iran executed more than
1,200 political prisoners between July 1988 and December 1988.
   The English language Tehran Times daily, which usually reflects
Rafsanjani's thinking, said Jan. 17 that the U.N. mission's visit
was ``the best way to neutralize baseless propaganda by the Western
media and enemies of the Islamic revolution.''
   Galindo Pohl will submit a report on his findings to the Human
Rights Commission's annual six-week session in Geneva that is to
begin Jan. 29.
   Nearly 1,000 people reportedly have been executed since December
1988. Iran responded to criticism of those executions by saying
that nearly all involved drug traffickers convicted by Islamic
courts. Iranian opposition groups said many were political
prisoners, however.

<HEAD>FAA Decertifies Controller in Runway Collision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The air traffic controller who was in charge of
two planes involved in a fatal runway crash last week was stripped
of his certification, a federal investigator said Sunday.
   The controller failed to warn the pilot of an Eastern Airlines
Boeing 727 that had just landed that there was a smaller plane on
the runway in front of him, said the official from the National
Transportation Safety Board.
   The pilot of the smaller plane, a twin-engine Beechcraft King
Air, was killed in the accident Thursday night at Hartsfield
Atlanta International Airport. The co-pilot of the Beechcraft was
slightly injured, but nobody aboard the airliner was hurt.
   The pilot of the Eastern plane, which carried 141 passengers,
spotted the smaller plane too late and tried to veer away, but the
airliner's right wing struck the smaller plane's cockpit.
   Safety board investigators were told the FAA had decertified the
controller due to an error made because procedures were not
followed, the NTSB said in a news release Sunday under the name of
chief investigator Bob MacIntosh.
   MacIntosh refused to answer questions.
   The controller, whose name was withheld, may apply for
retraining and recertification, but won't be allowed to direct air
traffic without certification.
   The controller was hired by the FAA in 1982 and has worked in
the Atlanta tower since October 1988, the NTSB said. He took his
post about four minutes before the accident.
   NTSB investigators said Saturday the pilot of Eastern Flight 111
from New York wasn't warned of the smaller plane on the runway
ahead of him, as is required.
   During a 2{-hour interview with NTSB investigators Sunday, the
controller acknowledged it was his responsibility to ensure the
runway was clear before allowing another plane to land, the NTSB
statement said.
   ``He stated that he thought that the King Air had cleared the
runway and was surprised that it had not,'' the statement said.
``However, he did not actually observe the King Air clear the
runway. He could not explain why he did not offer traffic
information to Eastern 111 about the King Air flight as required by
air traffic control procedures.''
   The controller also ``indicated that he was distracted'' by two
other aircraft, one that had just landed and another on landing
approach that had reported a possible hydraulic problem, the
statement said.
   The Eastern pilot, 23-year veteran Ralph Orlando, blamed the
crash on the controller.
   ``We should have been advised, at a minimum, that there was a
small plane and that it might not be cleared,'' Orlando said.
   Apparently no one in the tower saw the collision, MacIntosh said.
   The pilot who was killed, Eric Thomas, 30, worked for
Atlanta-based Epps Air Service.

<HEAD>Noriega's Wealth Overstated, Investigators Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators are concluding the Bush
administration exaggerated ousted Panamanian dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega's wealth, The Miami Herald reported Sunday.
   Many of the assets cited by the administration as evidence of
Noriega's fortune belonged to Panama's defense forces or are
registered to businessmen close to him, according to documents
emerging from Panamanian government offices in the aftermath of the
Dec. 20 U.S. invasion.
   A case in point, the Herald said, was the U.S. State Department
allegation that Noriega owned a Boeing 727 jet, three Lear jets and
three luxury boats named Macho I, Macho II and Macho III.
   Documents found in recent weeks suggest that none of those
planes and boats may be traceable to Noreiga, unidentified
officials of the U.S.-installed Panamanian government with access
to the seized records told the newspaper.
   That could complicate efforts by prosecutors to portray Noriega
as an immensely wealthy man in the former general's upcoming
federsal trial on drug charges in Miami.
   Noriega is accused of making millions in protection payments
from Colombian drug traffickers who used Panama to fly drugs to the
United States.
   The Boeing 727, purchased in 1983 for $2.2 million,. was first
acquired by the state-run Air Panama airline and later transferred
to Panama's defense forces, air traffic authorities said.
   Of the three executive jets, a Lear 35 that was regularly used
by Noriega was rented by Panama's defense forces to a Miami company
for $230,000 a month, officials said. A second Lear jet appears to
be partly owned by Carlos Duque, a businessman-poltician who made
millions from his association with the former dictator. Officials
said they don't know of a third Lear jet used by Noriega.
   The Macho I and Macho II were owned by Carlos Wittgreen, another
businessman who profited greatly from his friendship with Noriega,
documents show. No records on the third boat have been found.
   Noriega loyalists said the general used the military aircraft in
his capacity as defense forces commander. The boats were simply
lent to him by his best friends, they said.
   ``All these properties cited by the U.S. government exist but
were not his,'' said Mario Rognoni, a former commerce minister with
the Noriega regime. ``It's like saying that Camp David belongs to
(President) Bush.''
   Officials of the new civilian government counter that there is
widespread evidence that Noriega amassed a significant fortune
after taking over the defense forces in 1983.
   But officials privately concede that the U.S. government may
have liberally mixed fact with fiction in its efforts to convince
the world about Noriega's crimes, the Herald said. The State
Department's contention that Noriega's personal wealth was at least
$200 to $300 million will be hard to prove, investigators said.

<TEXT>
   The anti-communist revolutions in Eastern
Europe have yielded a bonanza for Israel in renewed diplomatic ties
and the Israelis hope it also means the end of training and weapons
support for Arab radicals.
   New openings toward Israel by countries that once firmly backed
the Arab cause ends a two-decade Soviet-bloc boycott of the Jewish
state imposed by Moscow after the 1967 Middle East war.
   On Sunday, Vice Premier Shimon Peres became the highest ranking
Israeli since 1967 to visit Czechoslovakia.
   ``We are now opening a new page in our relations with Eastern
Europe,'' said Yossi Ben-Aharon, a top aide to Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir.
   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn of Hungary, who recently visited
Jerusalem, described the changes as ``irreversible.''
   ``The old order cannot be restored,'' the Jerusalem Post quoted
him as saying in an interview.
   But it remains unclear whether the renewal of ties will
translate into long-term diplomatic support for Israel in the
Middle East conflict.
   Horn indicated Hungary was more interested in flourishing
economic ties than the Middle East conflict. However, he said he
supported an international Middle East peace conference, a proposal
accepted by the Arabs but staunchly rejected by Shamir.
   ``The Eastern Europe of today is not as pro-Palestinian as
before, but if Israel continues its hard line toward the
Palestinians, we cannot expect to win the support of these
countries,'' said Moshe Zimmermann, a historian at the Hebrew
University of Jerusalem.
   Palestinian analysts, meanwhile, acknowledged the Palestine
Liberation Organization suffered a diplomatic setback in Eastern
Europe because of its association with the overthrown communist
dictators. They said the PLO faced an uphill struggle to win the
support of the new leadership.
   ``The atmosphere is, to a certain extent, hostile to the
Palestinians,'' said Ghassan Katib, a prominent Palestinian
communist and West Bank university lecturer. ``We must establish a
dialogue with the these new forces.''
   Anti-Arab sentiment is especially strong in Romania where Arabs
were identified in revolutionary quarters as fighting in the ranks
of the hated Securitate secret police who sought to crush the
popular uprising against dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   In the meantime, the new Eastern European leaders are knocking
on Israel's door to renew ties cut in 1967. In September, Hungary
became the first. Poland and Czechoslovakia are expected to follow
this spring. Romania never severed ties, although it supported and
trained Arab guerrillas.
   Israel never had relations with East Germany, but a senior
Israeli official said such ties were expected if, as seems likely,
the East Germans drop their refusal to accept moral responsibility
for the Holocaust.
   In light of East Germany's economic problems, Israel would be
satisfied with a token payment of reparations, the official said.
   Eastern European leaders are mainly driven by the need to rescue
their crippled economies, and Israel, a close ally of the United
States, is seen as an important mediator.
   ``They believe Israel can pave the way for improved economic
relations with the Western world,'' said Mark Heller, an analyst at
Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies.
   But Israel is also seen as an economic partner in its own right.
Israeli exports to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union jumped to
$100 million last year, up 70 percent from 1988.
   The new Eastern European leaders, whose political survival
depends in part on their ability to end food shortages at home, are
especially interested in Israel's agricultural know-how.
   In December, the government-owned Israeli company Agridev signed
a cooperation agreement with Bulgaria under which Israel will
provide experts and equipment to run Bulgarian farms. A similar
agreement is expected to be signed with Poland.
   ``In the past year, many doors have been opened, due to the
changes in the political situation and the desire to supply enough
food,'' said Amram Olmert, managing director of Agridev.
   In addition to the diplomatic and economic windfalls, Israeli
officials cite a third beneficial development: an end to state
sponsorship of Palestinian terror squads.
   In the past, the PLO and other Palestinian groups maintained
close ties with Eastern Europe, especially Romania, Czechoslovakia
and East Germany, which trained and armed hundreds of Palestinian
guerrillas, according to Israeli intelligence sources.
   ``These countries provided training, weapons, served as host
facilities for terrorist organizations and sometimes provided
sabotage materials,'' said Heller.
   Israeli intelligence officials noted that Eastern European
support for Palestinian guerrilla groups has considerably dropped
in the past year, a trend they expected to continue.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if that activity stopped completely,''
Heller said.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry, acknowledging that he
needs ``to heal my body, mind and soul,'' but declining to mention
drug abuse, announced Sunday that he will seek help following his
arrest on a cocaine possession charge.
   ``He has reached the hour of reckoning,'' said his wife, Effi.
   At times blinking back tears, the mayor provided no further
details on what kind of assistance he will seek, except to say that
social activist and self-described nutritional expert Dick Gregory
has been consulting him on how to get help. An aide said Barry's
main problem was with alcoholism.
   Top advisers to the mayor, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the mayor was considering checking into the Betty Ford Clinic
in Rancho Mirage, Calif. and two unnamed clinics in the Washington
area.
   Later Sunday, one of Barry's top political advisers said the
mayor planned to enter a 30-day inpatient treatment program and
could leave as early as Monday. The aide, who also asked not to be
identified, did not know where the facility was located, but said
it was not in Washington.
   The Washington Post quoted unnamed sources in Monday's editions
as saying that while Barry had initially decided to seek treatment
at the Betty Ford center, he now is leaning toward an alternative
program with Gregory.
   In another development, the Post said some of Barry's longtime
political allies are starting to engage in behind-the-scenes moves
to shift their alliances to Jesse Jackson rather than incur their
own loss of influence in the event Barry's poltical career is over.
   Barry's brief statement was the latest chapter in an unfolding
drama that has riveted the nation's capital since the mayor was
arrested on drug charges last Thursday night.
   While the mayor did not say whether he is suffering from drug
abuse, others did.
   Herbert O. Reid Sr., one of the mayor's closest personal
advisors, said he hoped that from Barry's travails ``we can all
learn something about drug addiction.''
   ``He's doing the right thing,'' Reid said. ``I am _ we all are _
relieved, because many of us have suspected for some time that he
has had a problem.''
   ``The most serious problem is alcoholism,'' Barry spokeswoman
Lurma Rackley said. ``The mayor has acknowledged that he has a
health concern, and the details are his private matter.''
   ``For you to admit that you have a problem ... that you need to
make yourself whole again is truly a burden lifted from our
souls,'' the mayor's wife said in remarks that followed her
husband's. ``For our family it is just the beginning.
   Barry, surrounded by clergy in a broadcast appearance in front
of St. Timothy's Episcopal Church near his home, clasped his wife's
hand and said he has come ``face to face with my deepest human
failures.''
   Barry said, ``these ministers have helped me to keep the
strength I need ... I'm going to find a way to heal my body, mind
and soul.''
   The mayor did not take questions and turned the podium to Mrs.
Barry following his brief statement. Attention has been focused on
Mrs. Barry in part because the mayor was lured to his arrest by a
woman with whom the mayor has been friendly.
   Barry, 53, was arrested Thursday evening at a downtown hotel in
an FBI sting operation. He now faces a misdemeanor cocaine
possession charge after testing positive for cocaine in blood and
urine tests administered following his arrest.
   Close advisors to Barry told The Associated Press on Saturday
that the mayor has agreed to enter a drug treatment center. The
sources said details on the type of treatment and location of the
facility were still being worked out.
   Barry had been poised to announce his bid for a fourth term as
mayor on Sunday but his arrest has thrown local politics into
convulsions. Several advisers said Barry had agreed to abandon his
bid for re-election, and they added that the possibility of his
resigning from office was never discussed in Friday and Saturday
strategy sessions.
   ``The issue never came up, because it is so far out there beyond
what we are dealing with now,'' said one aide who spoke with Barry
several times on Saturday. ``There is no reason for him to resign,
because if he did, he would lose the powers of office, the
influence, and the ability to generate money for his treatment
program and his legal defense.''
   One Barry cabinet member suggested that prior grand jury
testimony _ in which the mayor has said he denied ever using drugs
_ prevented the mayor from making specific references to drug abuse
in his short announcement Sunday.
   ``If he had said he had a cocaine problem or some other form of
drug abuse, then he could possibly face a perjury charge,'' said
the aide, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. ``He had to be
careful.''
   The mayor is now faced with a quandary about whether to
permanently stay in office because law enforcement officials have
said that U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens will not drop the charges
against the mayor unless he steps down.
   Stephens has not commented on that issue directly, but he has
suggested he would look favorably on Barry's resigning when
deciding how to proceed with other, broader probes of the mayor's
activities.
   During their morning appearance, Barry frequently turned to his
wife, who stood by his side, grabbed her hand and squeezed it. With
a wan smile on her face, Ms. Barry then patted her husband's hand
in a comforting way and whispered to him.
   In her remarks, Mrs. Barry said: ``I thank God for this day that
he has given Marion Barry ... the strength to admit to this whole
world that as a mortal being he has reached the hour of reckoning.
For he realizes that it is truly in God's hands ...
   ``We, Christopher (their son) and I will be with you every step
of the way.''
   Barry said the events of the past several days had been ``more
difficult than fighting my way out of poverty'' or struggling in
the civil rights movement, because ``I spent so much time doing for
others that I have not worried enough about ... caring for myself.''
   ``I realize I'm going to have to walk this journey by myself,''
said Barry.
   When the short event was over, Barry slowly walked across the
street to his home, staring straight ahead and ignoring the
questions from a sea of reporters trailing him.
   But when one bystander shouted ``Hang in there Mr. Barry, you've
been a great mayor,'' Barry flashed a broad grin and waved a
campaigner's wave for a moment before his smile disappeared and his
arm fell limply to his side.

<HEAD>FBI Records Indicate Data Leaked by Supreme Court Justice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas
violated court confidentiality in 1966 by leaking information to
President Johnson, a history professor said, citing newly released
FBI records.
   The alleged leaks about court deliberations to the White House
and the FBI involved information that might discredit Robert F.
Kennedy, a former attorney general and political rival of Johnson.
   The documents, released to Marquette University history
professor Athan Theoharis under the Freedom of Information Act,
were outlined in The Milwaukee Journal on Sunday.
   FBI files say Fortas, who died in 1982, was cautioned by the
agency he would violate judicial ethics by reporting on private
discussions among the court's justices, the paper said.
   The records show Fortas, Johnson and White House aides saw an
opportunity to associate Kennedy with an illegal eavesdropping
incident that occurred while he was attorney general in 1963, the
paper said. Fortas discussed the case with the White House.
   ``It raises real questions about Fortas' role on the court and
the degree with which he identified with the partisan interests and
anti-Kennedy forces in the Johnson administration,'' Theoharis,
author of a 1988 book on FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, told the
paper.
   Fortas resigned from the court in 1969 during an unrelated
ethics matter. Hoover died in 1972 and Johnson in 1973.
   Theoharis said the files show Fortas violated the Constitution's
doctrine of separation of court and executive power by agreeing to
provide inside information to FBI assistant director C.D. De Loach.
   ``He should have thrown De Loach out on his ear,'' Theoharis
said.
   De Loach, now retired, told the Journal in a telephone interview
from Hilton Head Island, S.C., that he could recall nothing of the
case discussed in the files.
   The case involved bugging of a hotel room occupied by Fred
Black, a Washington, D.C., lobbyist who was appealing a fraud
conviction to the high court.
   Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall disclosed the the bugging.
   A memo written by Hoover June 14, 1966, said Fortas called
Marshall ``dumb.'' Marshall now sits on the Supreme Court.
   The court suspended deliberations in the Black case and asked
Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach if the FBI bugging was
authorized. Because Kennedy was attorney general at the time of the
bugging, there appeared an opportunity to discredit him, the
newspaper said.
   A memorandum by De Loach quoted Fortas as saying ``the entire
matter boiled down to a continuing fight for the presidency.''
Fortas volunteered to talk ``on a confidential basis at any time,''
it said.
   The Theoharis documents show Fortas told De Loach the justices
``held a confidential meeting among themselves'' and decided to
review FBI records before ruling on the Black appeal.
   Fortas suggested a plan to De Loach ``to protect the president
and the FBI'' by appointing a pro-Johnson arbitrator to review FBI
eavesdropping policy, bypassing Katzenbach, the documents said.
   Fortas telephoned De Loach June 21 to say Johnson was appointing
a three-member eavesdropping investigation panel. Johnson changed
his mind two days later, a De Loach memo said.
   The Justice Department said in July 1966 that Hoover authorized
the bugging under authority delegated by one or more of Kennedy's
predecessors as attorney general.
   In November, the Supreme Court ordered a new trial for Black,
calling the bugging illegal. Black was subsequently acquitted.
   Katzenbach, interviewed by telephone in New Jersey, said the
documents' disclosures surprised him.
   ``You think you know what's going on and you don't,'' Katzenbach
said.
   Scott Anderson, a co-author of the 1979 investigative book ``The
Brethen'' about the high court, said the documents seem to show an
unprecedented breach of Supreme Court tradition and procedure.
   ``This screams impropriety,'' said Geoffrey Miller, a University
of Chicago law professor. Codes of ethics forbid judges from
discussing judicial deliberations outside a courtroom, he said.
   ``It's disgraceful,'' said Harvard Law School professor Charles
Fried.

   Emmy-winning actress Barbara
Stanwyck, the sultry villainess of the film classic ``Double
Indemnity'' and stern matriarch of television's ``The Big Valley,''
died Saturday of heart failure. She was 82.
   Miss Stanwyck's career spanned the chorus line, vaudeville,
movies, television and won her three Emmys and an honorary Oscar.
   She appeared in more than 80 movies since the 1920s, including
four Academy Award-nominated roles: ``Stella Dallas'' in 1937,
``Ball of Fire'' in 1942 with Gary Cooper, ``Double Indemnity''
with Fred MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson in 1944, and ``Sorry
Wrong Number'' with Burt Lancaster in 1948.
   Her only Oscar, however, was an honorary statuette presented in
1982 for the body of her work.
   Her television career was equally distinguished.
   ``The Barbara Stanwyck Show'' ran from September 1960 to
September 1961. She hosted the program of half-hour plays and
appeared in most episodes.
   She received Emmy awards in 1961 for ``The Barbara Stanwyck
Show,'' in 1966 for her role in ``The Big Valley,'' and in 1983 for
the miniseries ``Thorn Birds.''
   The American Film Institute gave her its most prestigious honor,
the Life Achievement Award, in 1987.

   Soviet soldiers waged fierce street battles with
militants Saturday in the southern republic of Azerbaijan, and at
least 57 people were killed, the government said. Witnesses said
the death toll could be far higher.
   ``The street is covered with blood,'' Vadim Korsh, an editor of
Azerbaijan's official news agency, Azerinform, said of the scene at
a military garrison in the capital, Baku.
   One activist said more than 100 local troops at the garrison
joined the militants in fighting Soviet soldiers, thousands of
which were sent to quell a week of ethnic and separatist violence.
It was the first report of rebellion in local ranks.
   By evening, residents were reporting that the sound of gunfire
had stopped in the barracks and elsewhere in the city center.
   Early Sunday, Moscow Radio said Soviet forces were in control of
the city, though some gunfire could still be heard. The report,
quoted by the British Broadcasting Corp., said the first night of a
curfew passed in relative calm, with 18 people arrested for
violating the curfew.
   Azerbaijani President Elmira Kafarova on Saturday denounced the
``gross violation of the republic's sovereignty'' by the Kremlin's
declaration of a state of emergency without the approval of local
authorities.
   ``The people of Azerbaijan will never forgive anyone for the
tragic way their sons and daughters have been killed,'' she said.
   In Moscow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev went on nationwide TV
to appeal for an end to the violence that the government says has
killed more than 129 people, wounded 500 and chased thousands of
Armenians from their homes.
   ``In the last two years, the central authorities have sought to
act in a patient and thoughtful manner, trying to solve difficult
problems exclusively by peaceful, political means,'' Gorbachev said.
   But militants had begun threatening to take over the government
by force and are killing people, he said.
   ``This had to stop,'' said Gorbachev, who also has had to deal
with nationalist movements in other republics, including
neighboring Georgia, Moldavia and the Baltics.
   In Washington, the Bush administration called for ``restraint in
the use of force'' and said the sending of troops to stop the
violence should not ``become a cloak for the abridgment of the
exercise of political rights.''
   Iran, which borders Azerbaijan, urged the Soviet government to
``resolve the issue by employing peaceful means.''
   Moscow sent troops to Baku after fighting flared between the
Moslem Azerbaijanis and mainly Christian Armenians. The neighboring
republics are locked in a decades-old dispute over the region of
Nagorno-Karabakh, which is inside Azerbaijan but populated mainly
by Armenians.
   Speakers at rallies in Baku were reported to have demanded
secession from the Soviet Union and unification with Iran.
   Some 5,000 regular army troops and thousands more Interior
Ministry soldiers and police have moved in to try to restore order.
   Araz Ali-Zade, of the opposition Azerbaijani Social Democratic
Group, said 120 Azeribaijani soldiers under the command of a
colonel spent the afternoon in a pitched battle with Soviet troops
in the Salyanovsky Barracks in downtown Baku.
   By evening the shooting stopped, he said in a telephone
interview from the city, but he had no further details.
   The official Tass news agency quoted Deputy Defense Ministry
Gen. Valentin Varennikov as saying militants surrounded the
barracks and that troops who moved in to defend it were attacked by
snipers firing heavy-caliber machine guns from rooftops.
   The soldiers ``opened warning fire only in defense of strategic
sites and their own lives. If the attacks didn't stop, they fired
only on those who were threatening them,'' he said.
   The Interior Ministry reported 51 civilians and six soldiers
dead Saturday. It said 287 civilians and 36 soldiers were wounded.
Korsh said in a telephone interview from Baku that corpses were
strewn on the road to the city's airport.
   It was impossible to independently verify government casualty
figures, as foreign reporters have been barred from the region.
   Azerbaijani activists claimed the number of dead climbed into
the thousands after armored personnel carriers surrounded a central
square in Baku and opened fire with machine guns.
   But Arif Yunosof of the Azerbaijani Social Democratic Group said
the troops fired into the air in a vain attempt to dispel the crowd
of 30,000 to 40,000 people.
   Troops moved into Baku, a Caspian Sea port of 1.8 million
people, early Saturday. Army and internal security troops have been
building up in Armenia and Azerbaijan for several days, but they
previously had not entered Baku.
   Soldiers surrounded a square near the Communist Party
headquarters, where about 30,000 Azerbaijanis gathered in an
anti-government protest, said Leila Unusova, also of the
Azerbaijani Social Democrat Group.
   The biggest battles reportedly raged around the airport and
military garrison, where armed protesters had been trying to
prevent troop reinforcements from traveling to the strife-torn
areas.
   The Azerbaijan Communist Party chief, Abdul-Rakhman Vezirov, was
fired and replaced by two people: Azerbaijan Premier Ayaz Mutalibov
and party second secretary Viktor Polyanichko, Tass reported.
   Censorship was in full force as part of the state of emergency.
Tass had photographs of soldiers fighting civilians, but editors
said they were not permitted to release them.
   Radio Moscow said the measure forbids strikes and street
processions, the use of duplicating equipment, and the use of
transport without special permission. The first deputy foreign
minister, Alexander Bessmertnykh, told reporters the measures and
introduction of troops had improved the situation.
   But the reports of mass rallies and the continued sound of
gunshots ringing out in the capital indicated otherwise.
   Adding to the problems were daring political moves by
Azerbaijanis.
   The legislature of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, which is
controlled by the republic, voted to secede from Azerbaijan as well
as from the U.S.S.R., news reports said.
   Nakhichevan is a small enclave of about 250,000 people,
surrounded by Armenia, Iran and Turkey. It has been under
Azerbaijan's jurisdiction since 1924. Violence broke out there Jan.
1 when demonstrators forced open the border with Iran in an effort
to be reunited with their brethren in that country.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said the Supreme Soviet
legislature in Nakhichevan demanded Soviet troops leave the enclave
and appealed to Turkey, Iran and the United Nations for support.

<TEXT>
   When American adventurer William
Walker set fire to this handsome colonial city in 1856, the
citizens are said to have hidden their gold in holes in the ground
or in thick adobe walls.
   Among the remnants of that episode is the Granadinos' tendency
to tap on walls, hoping for a hollow sound, and the memory of the
U.S. invader who stuck a sign in the smoldering ruins with a
cynical message: ``Here was Granada.''
   When he came here for a campaign rally, President Daniel Ortega
seized on that 133-year-old memory to drive home one of the
Sandinistas' messages _ they represent the defense of national
sovereignty in the face of U.S. intervention.
   ``Times haven't changed that much,'' Ortega told some 6,000
Granadinos who recently gathered at the central park for a rally.
``The Yankees are still trying.'''
   In one campaign appearance after another, Ortega plays the
Sandinistas' top drawing cards _ patriotism, patronage and
packaging. He is taking aim at two important blocs as he tries for
another six-year term in the Feb. 25 elections _ women and youth.
   ``This is a young country. The young people are the future. They
are our future,'' said one Sandinista militant whose job is to
observe rallies.
   The voting age in Nicaragua is 16, and an estimated 46 percent
of Nicaraguans are under 15 years of age.
   Women, especially those in the 16-35 age bracket, are also an
important bloc. They normally are 51 percent of the population but
are an even greater percentage now; more than 12 years of armed
conflict has killed thousands of men and left others refugees or
members of the Contra army ranks.
   Early in the campaign, Ortega, a young-looking 44, was
repackaged to create a new image.
   ``Daniel, President of the Young,'' proclaim posters, billboards
and grafitti, many of them around university campuses and schools.
   The president traded his prescription glasses for contact
lenses. He switched from his sober trademark camouflage uniform to
black T-shirts worn under cotton bomber jackets with sleeves rolled
up. He started wearing cowboy boots.
   In December, Ortega started dancing with skimpily clad beauty
queens.
   In Granada he danced on stage with Marucha, a barefoot and
aproned food vendor known for her ``chancho con yuca,'' a favorite
Nicaraguan dish of fried pork rinds with yucca. The crowd was
delighted.
   A regular feature at Sandinista rallies is a session where
Ortega poses with children for photographs.
   Dour-faced state security agents lean down from the 7-foot-high
speaking platform to pick up tiny babies whose parents want to go
home with an instant picture of junior and the president.
   Like most rallies, the Granada rally was followed by a ceremony
honoring relatives of war victims.
   This time it was a dinner at Granada's best hotel for members of
the Mothers of Heroes and Martyrs, a Sandinista organization. With
few Nicaraguan families untouched by the war between the
Sandinistas and the U.S.-backed Contra rebels, and with most people
unable to afford restaurants, the gesture will likely be remembered.
   Josefa Salinas, the 22-year-old daughter of a poor peasant
family, waited in a broiling sun, then a downpour, for Ortega to
appear.
   Ms. Salinas, from the nearby community of El Capulin, graduated
in December from a Granada technical school with a degree in
accounting.
   ``Before, I would not have been able to study. Before, you had
to pay. Now it's free,'' she said.
   Ms. Salinas was 12 years old when the Sandinistas came to power
in July 1979 and ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza.
   The irony is that while the Sandinistas have made it possible
for a poor peasant child such as Ms. Salinas to obtain an
education, now that she has it, she can't find work. Unemployment
among Nicaraguan youth is widespread and unabating.
   ``I'm looking. But there doesn't seem to be any work,'' she said.
   However, her vote will be ``100 percent, totally'' for the
Sandinista Front.
   Why?
   ``It's the way they are carrying out the revolutionary process,
how they treat the people,'' she said. ``Before, with the
Somocistas, the government would deal only with the rich people and
the gringos, just among themselves. Now we are taken into account.''
   Ms. Salina's father was an itinerant peasant who rented his
labor to large landowners under Somoza. The Sandinista government
gave him land through agrarian reform and he now works in a farm
cooperative.
   The Sandinistas have exercised their patronage as the ruling
party and handed out hundreds of land and home titles to Nicaraguan
families; they've given taxi cooperatives easy credit to buy new
cars; government workers have obtained pay raises.
   Party pins and other symbols of recognition have been
distributed like candy, as have T-shirts, baseball caps, tote bags,
belt buckles, kerchiefs, pens, cigarette lighters and posters.
   The Sandinista Youth, an organization for men and women roughly
between ages 15 and 30, harnesses that force for party purposes.
The government sponsors popular dances with local and foreign bands
and promotes sports; belonging to it means preferential treatment
in obtaining scholarships and other advantages.
   High school student Marta Lorena Mendoza, 18, said she joined
the Sandinista Youth four days before the rally and had been sent
out everyday to hand out leaflets announcing Ortega's arrival.
   ``Everybody in the neighborhood belongs to the Sandinista
Youth,'' she said. ``My cousin,'' an older boy who is in the
Sandinista army, ``told me I should join.''

<TEXT>
   The top opposition
presidential candidate jumped back onto the campaign trail over the
weekend after knee surgery, dismissing government suggestions she
may withdraw from the race.
   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of the United National Opposition,
or UNO, pledged peace and prosperity during a speech to supporters
Saturday in the southern town of San Rafael Del Sur. She said her
coalition would ban the draft if it wins general elections Feb. 25.
   She is challenging President Daniel Ortega, who is seeking
another six-year term.
   Mrs. Chamorro, 60, wore a cast on her left leg and sat in a
wheelchair as she spoke from the back of a pickup truck in this
town, an opposition stronghold. About 3,000 people gathered to hear
Mrs. Chamorro and other UNO candidates.
   UNO leaders say they have received little of the $9 million
appropriated for Nicaragua in October by the U.S. Congress. About
$2 million is meant as direct aid to UNO and the rest is to support
the general electoral process.
   While the ruling leftist Sandinista Front has handed out
thousands of T-shirts, pins, pens, cigarette lighters, baseball
caps, tote bags and other such items, most UNO slogans appear as
graffiti scrawled on walls.
   ``Now they (Sandinistas) are distributing little gifts to buy
votes,'' Mrs. Chamorro told the crowd.
   ``I say, take the T-shirt, put a little bleach on it, take
Daniel's name off and put your own name on it if you want,'' she
told a cheering crowd.
   Clothing, even a T-shirt, is expensive for most Nicaraguans.
   ``As if the country could forget 10 years of war because of a
T-shirt,'' Mrs. Chamorro said, referring to the civil war between
the leftist government and U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   The widow of revered civic leader Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, and
the publisher of La Prensa, Nicaragua's only opposition newspaper,
Mrs. Chamorro received the backing of 14 parties _ ranging from
conservatives to communists _ that united to form an
anti-Sandinista bloc.
   Mrs. Chamorro suffers from osteoporosis, an illness that makes
bones brittle, and she fractured her knee when she fell at home
Dec. 31.
   She underwent surgery at a Houston clinic, where President Bush
telephoned twice to inquire about her health. She returned last
week to Nicaragua.
   Ortega has suggested repeatedly that UNO might withdraw from the
elections, label them a fraud and invite a U.S. invasion like the
one last month in Panama. Mrs. Chamorro and running mate Virgilio
Godoy of the Independent Liberal Party have repeatedly denied plans
to withdraw.
   Mrs. Chamorro assured the crowd that ``I take a pill for the
pain'' and will keep campaigning.
   Polls have shown that voters' top concerns are ending the
two-year draft, obligatory for 16-year-old boys, ending the civil
war, and reviving a moribund economy.
   Since the U.S. invasion of Panama, the Sandinistas have said
they expect Nicaragua to be the next target of an invasion, but the
State Department has dismissed such talk.
   Mrs. Chamorro said Saturday she was ``allergic'' to weapons and
derided Ortega's claims of wanting peace while keeping the largest
armed forces by far in Central America.
   They are estimated at about 150,000 members, including militias
and reserves.
   ``With your vote, you can say goodbye to the obligatory military
service (draft) and to inflation forever,'' she said.
   Hyperinflation of 36,000 percent for 1988 was brought down to
1,600 percent last year after the government put into effect an
austerity program, according to government figures. However, some
economists believe the inflation rate is actually higher.

   China's Great Wall Foundation has been chosen to
launch an Arab communications satellite, the official Xinhua News
Agency said Sunday.
   The satellite will be launched at the end of 1991 for the Arab
Organization for Satellite Communications, a network that groups
Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Morocco, Iraq, Syria and
Jordan.
   Arabsat, as it is also known, already has two satellites in
orbit.
   Xinhua said China's bid was selected at an Arabsat meeting last
week, and the choice was announced by Mohamed Shaheen Ismail,
director-general of the group's Jordan office.
   Great Wall is China's commercial satellite-launching venture. It
has negotiated several launches in recent years but none has taken
off.
   In December, President Bush gave approval for it to launch three
U.S.-made satellites over the next two years for Hong Kong and
Australian owners.
   China has sent 25 of its own satellites into space since 1970.

   Authorities arrested 37 Moslem
fundamentalists in connection with an attack at a trial in an
Algerian courthouse that killed three people, the French news
agency Agence France-Presse reported Sunday.
   A Shiite Moslem group, the Tradition of the Prophet and Islamic
Law, claimed responsibility for the attack, which was stopped by a
gunbattle that killed an 18-year-old gendarme and two of the
assailants.
   The incident occurred Tuesday in Blida, an Algiers suburb.
   Several assailants yelling ``God is great!'' burst into the
courtroom and took several hostages during the trial of an elderly
man accused of killing his wife. Authorities surrounded the
courtroom, and gunfire broke out. The hostages were freed.
   An investigating magistrate on Saturday night began questioning
the 37 men, who were arrested in the area, AFP said. Four men had
been charged with taking hostages and mounting an attack with a
deadly weapon, the news agency said.
   Police had no idea what prompted the attack and knew little
about the group that claimed responsibility.

<HEAD>Agencies' Use of Contractors Ruled Improper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department improperly used private
contractors to write congressional testimony for Energy Secretary
James D. Watkins and to review security clearances, the General
Accounting Office said Sunday.
   The GAO, an arm of the Congress that acts as the government's
auditor, also ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency
improperly used a contractor to run a telephone hotline to answer
questions from the public about the agency's Superfund program of
cleaning up the worst hazardous waste sites.
   The contracts in these three cases should be modified or
terminated, the GAO said, ``to ensure that these inherently
governmental functions are not performed by contractors.''
   ``The GAO's decision is confirmation that something has gone
very wrong when government officials are no more than mouthpieces
or rubber stamps for testimony, rules and decisions prepared by
private contractors,'' said Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., who had asked
GAO to review the contracts.
   Pryor is chairman of the federal services subcommittee of the
Governmental Affairs Committee and a longtime critic of federal
agencies' reliance on contractors.
   EPA spokeswoman Robin Woods said the agency planned to retain
the contract.
   ``We have made a decision to use our limited resources in areas
which must be addressed by civil servants, such as in the
development of regulations and policies, while contracting out for
technical information services,'' Ms. Woods said.
   At the Energy Department, spokeswoman Catherine Kaliniak said
the department would not comment until it had reviewed the
auditors' decision.
   The Energy Department has come under increasing criticism by
Congress for its heavy reliance on contractors. The department has
about 16,000 federal workers and more than 100,000 contract
employees. Watkins has complained publicly that his agency does not
have enough money to hire federal workers to perform the scientific
and other technical work that currently is done by contractors.
   Pryor's subcommittee disclosed last November that employees of
the contractor Systematic Management Services and those of one of
its subcontractors, BDM Corp., had written the testimony that
Watkins gave before the House Armed Services Committee on April 3,
1989, on the nuclear weapons complex.
   The GAO said that in addition to writing Watkins' testimony,
Systematic Management Services also prepared answers to
congressional inquiries resulting from Watkins' confirmation
hearing last February, and prepared briefing books and other
materials for Watkins for congressional hearings.
   Although the GAO decision made no mention of it, Pryor's
subcommittee has charged also that contractors prepared testimony
for other senior Energy Department officials, including Leo Duffy,
Watkins' chief adviser on waste management.
   The GAO said the department has admitted that this use of
contractors violated the department's own rules. More broadly, the
auditors said, the preparation of congressional testimony is
government work that should be done only by federal employees.
   The GAO also said the Energy Department was wrong to hire Maxima
Corp. of Bethesda, Md., to hear evidence in security clearance
cases. Hearing officers provided by Maxima do not grant clearances,
but they make recommendations to department managers on granting,
denying or revoking clearances, the auditors said.
   Maxima employees also serve as examiners who hear appeals of
security clearance decisions.
   This contract also calls for Maxima to do psychiatric
evaluations of security clearance applicants, according to
department records made available to The Associated Press. It also
is to audit computerized files of personnel security information on
240,000 individuals and correct inaccuracies in the files.
   The department asserted to the GAO that the Maxima contract was
proper because the hearing officers and examiners do not make final
decisions on security clearances. The auditors ruled, however, that
these are ``quasi-judicial services which are inherently
governmental functions that should not be procured by contract.''
   Last July, the Energy Department revealed in a classified
hearing of the House Energy and Commerce investigations
subcommittee that contract employees were used to conduct
interviews of applicants for the highest level security clearances
at nuclear arms plants. It said this was done because there were
not enough federal staffers available, even though it violates
written department policy. A sanitized transcript of that hearing
was released last month.
   In the EPA case reviewed by the GAO, the auditors said
GEO-Resource Consultants Inc. of San Francisco has been on the
agency's payroll since 1980 to operate the Superfund hotline. The
auditors said this arrangement raises questions ``concerning the
amount of discretion and value judgment'' used by the contractor in
answering questions about certain environmental laws.
   The EPA contends that the hotline contract is proper because the
contractor ``is merely a conduit for information'' and is not
making decisions for the government. GAO disagreed, saying the
contract employees, in responding to caller's questions, use their
own judgment to interpret EPA regulations.

   The tumultuous revolution in Romania,
culminating in the execution of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, sent
shivers down the spines of the Chinese leadership.
   Of the East European countries that experienced pro-democracy
movements, Romania had the best relations with China. There also
were similarities in their relative economic and political
developments.
   But while the Romanian people succeeded in their revolution, the
Chinese student movement, which preceded the changes in Bucharest
and around Eastern Europe by six months, failed.
   Several critical differences between the two countries helped
China's rulers. Their economy was stronger than Romania's. Their
troops remained loyal. And Romania's revolution was watched by the
benevolent eye of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, while
China's students had little but ample air time on Western TV.
   A fear of chaos in China, brought on by nightmarish memories of
the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution, also helped the Beijing's
hard-liners.
   The question _ Why not China? _ is being pondered not only by
those who study Beijing, but by those who run it. Western and
Chinese sources report meetings are being held weekly, and even
daily, among Communist Party cells, government units and the
military to stress the leadership's view of the Romanian revolution
as an ``anti-socialist uprising,'' much like the
``counterrevolutionary uprising'' of Beijing in the spring of 1989.
   After Ceausescu's execution, more troops were rushed to Beijing
to prevent demonstrations. One Hong Kong magazine reports that some
senior cadres ``were unable to eat'' upon hearing of the dictator's
demise.
   Why did the tumult in Timisoara touch such a tender nerve among
the Chinese leadership?
   Romania had the closest ties with China in Eastern Europe and
was in lockstep with the Beijing leadership on many issues of
practical and political importance. Both countries at early dates
in their Communist history distanced themselves from the Soviet
Union's foreign policy. Both revered the discredited Soviet
dictator Josef Stalin.
   There were reports Ceausescu considered seeking refuge in
Beijing as he fell from power.
   Romania's political structure also closely resembled China's.
Ceausescu was a dictator who placed family members in important
positions to perpetuate his Communist dynasty.
   China for most of the past decade has remained in the hands of
one man _ Deng Xiaoping. Nepotism is rife.
   But in June of 1989, the differences between the two countries
proved critical.
   When Deng seized power in 1978, he launched a reform program
that doubled China's gross national product in a decade, gave land
back to the peasants and sparked a marked increase in the average
standard of living.
   The economic reforms did not come with any concrete political
changes. Periods of relative liberalism were followed by crackdowns
on ``bourgeois liberalism'' and ``spiritual polllution,'' buzzwords
for democratic yearnings.
   But the people were not hungry, and their anger during the June
pro-democracy movement turned quickly to fear. The bloodiest part
of the crackdown lasted a weekend.
   In Romania, meanwhile, Ceausescu choked his economy in his drive
to repay foreign debt, sparking the most pervasive shortages in
Eastern Europe. Among the people, hunger and exasperation with
another winter without coal, oil or electricity led to desperation
_ enough that people would risk their lives to complete the
revolution.
   Romania's military was not immune to these influences. And by
apparently killing at least one military commander, the Securitate
forces alienated themselves from the regular troops, a fatal
mistake.
   In China, the military remained loyal to the state. One reason
is that China does not have a special security force separate from
the military and was thus spared the possibilities of such a
confrontation. Another is that China's army was born from a true
national liberation struggle in the 1920s and has a long history of
loyalty to the Communist Party.
   Despite its economic quagmire, Romania passed through several
decades of relative political stability before its revolution. In
the 1960s, China suffered the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution,
during which millions were killed as Mao Tse-tung sought to purge
his country of bourgeois influences. The experience left many
Chinese fearful of mass movements. In the minds of many Chinese,
the government justified its oppression by evoking fears of the
chaos of not so long ago.
   But now the Chinese leadership appears to be sowing the seeds
for the next round of chaos. It is dismantling the very reform
program that saved it.
   Leading reformers have been purged. Small-scale private and
collectively owned enterprises are being closed throughout the
country, putting millions out of work. Peasants are again being
forced to grow grain, thereby sacrificing the lucrative vegetable
market. The government has taken to issuing them IOU's that have no
deadline for collection. Workers' salaries are effectively being
cut as the government pays an increasingly high percentage of their
wages in non-negotiable bonds.
   Further blows have been struck by a fall in foreign investments.
One respected Hong-Kong based consultants' group recently branded
China the riskiest investment in Asia _ even worse than the
Philippines, which is still reeling from the bloody coup attempt in
December.
   More trouble seems inevitable.
   The worry is that the next flurry might not be centered on the
students, who with their marches and hunger strikes made
non-violence a way of life.
   China's next round of trouble might come from the countryside or
the inner cities, led by a people schooled in the art of discourse.

   When Congress returns this week, lobbyist
Kevin Kearney will climb out of his hot tub, slip into a
conservative blue suit and head for Capitol Hill to give America's
35,000 card-carrying nudists some national exposure.
   ``We need to come out of the closet,'' says Kearney, the first
full-time lobbyist for the Florida-based American Sunbathing
Association.
   Kearney, 38, an avid outdoorsman, has become an enthusiastic
convert to ``clothing-optional'' recreation since he was hired last
March by the oldest and biggest nudist organization in the country.
   He conducts business from an office in his suburban Cabin John,
Md., home, and has installed a telephone in the backyard next to
his bubbling hot tub, where he makes calls while skinny-dipping.
``It's a good place to work,'' he says.
   In his battle against government cover-ups, Kearney works
closely with Turner V. Stokes, a Leesburg, Va., computer specialist
and longtime nudist who founded NUDEPAC, a nudist political action
committee, five years ago.
   ``We're mad as hell, and we won't take it anymore,'' says
Stokes, borrowing from the line made popular by the movie
``Network.''
   Kearney already has lobbied the National Park Service and other
federal agencies to issue regulations guaranteeing nudists the
right to enjoy swimming, camping, hiking, white-water ``canuding''
and other recreational activities on public lands.
   His next targets are the 65 members of House and Senate
committees with jurisdiction over public lands. He recently mailed
each of them a copy of the ASA's artsy new wall calendar for 1990,
featuring photos of nudes romping in the Grand Canyon, splashing in
Colorado hot springs and scaling snow-covered California mountain
peaks.
   Only two legislators responded. A California Democrat wrote back
asking for more calendars. An Iowa Republican's envelope came back
unopened and stamped ``Return to Sender.''
   Undaunted, Kearney is pondering several other gimmicks to
improve the nudist image among Washington power brokers.
   He's thinking of inviting every member of Congress to a nearby
Maryland nudist camp this summer to shed their inhibitions, press
the flesh and enjoy some barbecue in the buff.
   On National Nude Weekend in mid-July, Kearney may lead a
bare-bottomed sailboat regatta down the Potomac River to challenge
federal, state and local anti-nudity regulations. He's also ready
to propose a federal excise tax on bathing suits, which he calls
``a piece of totally useless recreational equipment.''
   There are no federal laws outlawing nudity. Spokesmen for the
National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service and the Tennessee
Valley Authority say nudists generally are welcome on public lands
unless their activities are forbidden by local statutes or threaten
to disturb the tranquility of wilderness areas.
   But George Berklacy, a National Park Service spokesman, had
discouraging news for Kearney. ``We have no intention of developing
regulations which allow for nude sunbathing,'' he said.
   Kearney complained that without uniform federal regulations,
unsuspecting nudists run the risk of arbitrary eviction by hostile
park rangers, some of whom have threatened their au naturel
visitors with guns or handcuffs.
   ``Our people have lost many beaches over the last decade, and
they're frustrated and tired of being hassled,'' he said. ``This
sort of thing would never be allowed to happen to surf casters or
tennis players or golfers.''
   Kearney is convinced that despite all the prejudice and
snickering, an estimated 40 million Americans _ many of them
well-educated, highly paid professionals _ ``have participated in
nude recreation at some time,'' from neighborhood hot tub parties
to vacations on Yugoslavia's famed nude beaches.
   ``All of a sudden, Americans are going to change their attitudes
quickly,'' he predicted. ``All they need is a catalyst.''
   What kind of catalyst? ``It's going to happen when people come
out of the closet,'' he said, ``when you get a president of the
United States who'll go on television and admit that he's a
nudist.''

<TEXT>
   Lee Patrick Brown, who takes office Monday as
New York's 36th police commissioner, has made a career of tackling
troubled police departments.
   Nicknamed ``the Iceman,'' he is known as a cool, deliberate _
some say stiff _ administrator who meticulously studies problems
before acting.
   His supporters say the 52-year-old Brown is a dedicated crime
fighter prepared to tackle the nation's largest city. They call him
a a thinking person's cop who recognizes the importance of fighting
crime at its roots, including trying to correct the social ills
that foster criminals.
   His detractors say he is more a politician than a policeman,
garnering good publicity for the department while the police force
unravels from within.
   When Brown became public safety commissioner in Atlanta in 1978,
the department was reeling from a series of child murders that
shocked the nation, anti-discrimination lawsuits and a promotion
examinations scandal. In 1982, he was appointed police chief in
Houston, a city where the police had a trigger-happy reputation.
   By the time he left both cities, both police departments had won
praise and many officials begged him to stay. Two recent incidents
in Houston in which white or Hispanic officers have shot and killed
black motorists have once again tarnished the department's image,
but Brown emerged relatively unscathed. Just before he left
Houston, he fired the officers involved.
   His resume is impressive, with a Ph.D. in criminology and a
master's degree in sociology. He's been a patrolman in San Jose,
Calif., and a professor at Portland State and Howard universities.
   Brown's past is not without controversy, however, and he has
received a cold shoulder from New York police as he prepares to
take over the nation's largest police department.
   When new Mayor David Dinkins tapped Brown, he was going against
the wishes of Gov. Mario Cuomo, former Mayor Edward I. Koch and the
Patrolman's Benevolent Association; all supported the retention of
Richard Condon, who had served as police commissioner since the
retirement of Ben Ward in October.
   Numerous officers have told the press that they resent Brown
winning the job over the popular Condon, but the patrolmen's
association has taken a wait-and-see attitude.
   The organization's response certainly has been more restrained
than that of Houston police when he was named as the first black
chief there. They sent ``truth squads'' to Atlanta to check on
their new boss.
   ``They were pretty hard on him but we have no reason to do
that,'' said Joseph Mancini, a spokesman for the New York
patrolmen's association.
   Richard Murray, a political pollster at the University of
Houston, said Brown is very good at public relations. The
popularity of Houston police shot up during Brown's first few years.
   ``He's a Ph.D. and that doesn't hurt,'' Murray said. ``He's
worked his way up.''
   All agree that Brown loves criminology jargon and terminology,
sprinkling his conversations with bureaucratic phrases like
``problem-solving analysis'' and ``patrol-management plans.''
   ``He's not exactly a quote machine,'' said J.C. Mosier, a
Houston police spokesman.
   Once, when he testified in the trial of Wayne Williams, the man
convicted in some of the Atlanta child murders, an exasperated
defense attorney asked Brown if he spoke English.
   Nor is he a popular guy in the Houston police department. Police
groups say that Brown did what Mayor Kathy Whitmire wanted him to
do and did little to better the life of the average police officer.
   Still smarting from the collapse of the domestic oil market,
Houston has been unable to afford a police cadet class since 1986,
with attrition shrinking the police force to about 3,900 and police
receiving only minimal pay raises.
   When word got out that Brown was going to New York, some Houston
police officers sang ``I Love New York,'' over police radios.
   Houston Police Patrolmen's Union President Mike Howard said
Brown ``has hurt morale here terribly. The department has gotten so
bad the last couple of years and he has done nothing to help.''
   Howard compared him to ``a magician using mirrors, smoke and
glitter and the department all looks fine. But, on the inside, the
department is falling apart.''
   Whitmire said the complaints from police groups come mostly from
the old guard officers who resisted Brown's modernization efforts,
which include a strong emphasis on minority hiring.
   ``People in New York will find that he can always be counted on
to be very professional, very measured,'' Whitmire said. ``Lee's
not a person to shoot from the hip or to go with any decision
without it being well thought out.''
   Brown says he brings no preconceived notions on how to fight
crime in New York. In his calm, precise tone he says he unworried
by the lack of a welcome mat.
   ``Once I get there, I intend to reach out to them. Once I get to
meet the people, they'll understand I am a natural at this,'' Brown
said.

   Thousands of Azerbaijanis demonstrated Sunday to
protest the government's crackdown on ethnic violence in their
southern republic and to mourn nationalists who died in the
fighting.
   At the same time, Armenians congregated at a Moscow church and
cemetery to mourn their dead and collect money and offer housing
for refugees.
   At least 2,000 Azerbaijanis living in the Soviet capital
gathered at the republic's government offices, then marched to the
central headquarters of the official news agency Tass, where they
protested its portrayal of the crackdown.
   According to Tass, 51 civilians and six soldiers, died in
clashes in Baku, the Azerbaijan capital, on Saturday. Nationalist
groups in Azerbaijan and Moscow put the death toll much higher but
could not substantiate their figures.
   The crackdown, ordered by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, came
after years of ethnic tensions and territorial disputes between
mostly Christian Armenians and predominantly Moslem Azerbaijanis in
the Caucasus region.
   The Azerbaijani demonstrators demanded that the chief editor
come out of Tass headquarters and explain to them why the news
agency was ``distorting'' events in the Azerbaijani capital. When
no one emerged, the demonstrators moved off toward the studios of
Gostelradio, the state-run television and radio.
   ``They are not telling the truth,'' said one of the
demonstration organizers. ``We are not being told what is really
happening in Baku.''
   The protesters, many wearing black armbands, waved Azerbaijani
flags and held up placards blaming the violence in Armenia and
Azerbaijan on Gorbachev.
   The signs said, ``More Than 1,000 Murdered, Thousands Injured,''
``Tragedy in Baku _ Reflection of Gorbachev Politics'' and ``Who is
Next, Gorbachev?''
   Gorbachev told a nationwide television audience Saturday that
troops were sent to Baku as a last resort after efforts to solve
the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict peacefully failed.
   As the Azerbaijanis marched on media offices, Armenians gathered
at a church inside the Vagankovsky Cemetery in western Moscow to
mourn the dozens of Armenian victims of the ethnic violence.
   They lit candles and listened to an organ playing somber music
inside the small red brick church. Outside, volunteers sat at a
table on the snow-covered sidewalk to collect donations for the
15,000 Armenian refugees who fled Baku.
   Demonstrators outside the church held protest signs, including
one that blamed Moscow for the deaths of Armenians killed by
Azerbaijanis in clashes before Soviet troops were sent to Baku.

<HEAD>Abortion Foes Hope To Keep Debate Alive This Election Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a push for new restrictions in
legislatures around the country, opponents of abortion hope to keep
debate on the issue alive during this election year _ to the
discomfort of their Republican allies who'd like to see it go away.
   ``In 1990 no candidate can run for public office without
squarely facing the abortion issue,'' Republican chairman Lee
Atwater told GOP officials Friday.
   Then, with a little less certainty, he added that ``I would hope
Republicans support Republican candidates regardless of their
position on abortion.''
   After losing crucial 1989 elections, anti-abortion leaders were
trying to regain the offensive by pressing state legislatures to
impose a variety of limits on women's rights to obtain abortions.
   Abortion-rights leaders say they expect some legislatures will
pass some restrictions this year. But they believe they will
prevail in most, and that the fights will help shape the 1990
elections for governor, state legislatures and other offices.
   The two sides in the volatile debate were taking different
approaches to Monday's 17th anniversay of the Supreme Court's Roe
vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion.
   Opponents of that decision were massing for a march on the U.S.
Capitol and planning other demonstrations around the country, while
supporters of abortion were concentrating on low-key lobbying
activities.
   Both sides agree the intensifying battles over abortion will
dominate many races this year, from Congress to local offices, just
as in the few elections last fall.
   ``Anybody running for anything short of school board is going to
be put on the spot,'' said Charles Cook, editor of a Washington
political newsletter. ``Everybody up and down the line is going to
have to address it.''
   Republicans have candidates on both sides of the issue, but
under the banner of a party platform that is solidly against
abortion and a president who has vetoed abortion-rights bills from
Congress.
   Atwater contends the party ``is big enough to accept different
views,'' a position many party conservatives dispute.
   ``State your position, and move on,'' is the advice Michele
Davis, director of the Republican Governors' Association, gives her
candidates. ``Don't allow yourself to be immersed in that one and
only issue.''
   The restrictions sought by the National Right to Life Committee
and other anti-abortion groups were made possible by last year's
Supreme Court ruling that opened the way for new state limits on
abortion. The Webster decision revived political intensity over the
issue and thrust it squarely in the hands of the states.
   While the states may be the main arena, Congress is certain to
replay the battles it fought on the margins of the abortion debate
last fall.
   For the first time, the House joined the Senate in voting down
restrictions on federally financed abortions for poor women in
cases of rape or incest _ prompting President Bush to issue a
series of vetos that the pro-choice majority could not override.
   Abortion-rights advocates say they will try again later this
year, presenting the prospects of Bush vetoes just before the fall
elections. And even right-to-life leaders concede polls show a
majority of public opinion supports allowing abortion in those
tragic cases.
   ``This cuts against the Republicans,'' said Rep. Les AuCoin,
D-Ore. ``It did last year, will this year. I think if there's no
movement on their side to a more humane approach on this, it's
going to cost them dearly at the polls.''
   Abortion-rights supporters also plan to keep the political
debate churning by holding hearings this spring on House and Senate
bills that would incorporate into federal law the Roe vs. Wade
decision. They aren't likely to have enough votes to win passage of
the measure, which is aimed at preventing further erosion of
abortion rights before the Supreme Court.
   The right-to-life strategists are basing their hopes for winning
new state laws on polls showing that in spite of majority support
for keeping abortions legal, there is significant support for some
limits on abortions when taken on a case by case basis.
   For example, a national USA Today poll taken late last month
showed 72 percent favored laws requiring notification of parents
before a minor may obtain an abortion, and 63 percent support a
mandatory 24-hour waiting period.
   Those type of restrictions are among the half-dozen or so bills
the National Right to Life Committee is pushing, though they vary
in details by states.
   ``Anything we can pass will be progress,'' said Burke J. Balch,
state legislative coordinator for the National Right to Life
Committee. ``We'll be very happy if we can get one of each of these
pieces of legislation in one or two states.''
   Other restrictions pushed by the right-to-life groups include
banning abortions for gender selection; giving fathers rights to
block an abortion in court; banning abortions in public facilities
and blocking government counseling on abortions; and ``informed
consent'' requirements forcing women to receive information about
the abortion process and fetal development.
   But the most significant restriction would bar abortion as a
means of birth control _ a catch-all phrase that encompasses 90
percent or more of all abortions.

   In both foreign and internal affairs, Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is trying to instill the idea of negotiation and law into
a country accustomed to the heavy-handed style that filled labor
camps and unmarked graves and invaded neighboring countries.
   Only the threat of civil war and secession overcame Gorbachev's
deep reluctance to use force and persuaded him to send troops into
the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to stop ethnic fighting between
Azerbaijanis and Armenians.
   Mindful of bloody precedents, Gorbachev first tried to defuse
the conflict with decrees, discussions and appeals to use common
sense.
   Gorbachev said he ordered the military to shoot if necessary
only when he became convinced he had no alternative.
   ``It could no longer go on,'' a weary-looking Gorbachev told the
nation in a television address Saturday.
   ``The state is duty-bound to put an end to lawlessness and
inhumanity, to resolutely curb criminal actions of extremists who
have lost human face, who are prepared to take other people's lives
for the sake of personal ambition, selfish interests and power,''
he said.
   Victims of the conflict as well as the budding political
opposition openly second-guess him, accusing Gorbachev of
aggravating the problem with indecision.
   But Gorbachev has staked his reforms on convincing the world
that the Soviet Union believes consultation is better than
confrontation. Internally, he is removing Moscow's heavy hand in
order to shift more responsibility to local authorities.
   In raising the prestige and power of local authorities, he has
assumed that they logically will follow his reform policies, and he
has appeared startled and angry when they have not.
   Until last week, the Soviet leader had deployed Interior
Ministry soldiers only to guard vital installations in Armenia and
Azerbaijan, and to end bloody attacks on minority Meskhetian Turks
in Uzbekistan that left about 100 people dead.
   Once, when he was out of the country, violence was used against
nationalist protesters in the republic of Georgia.
   Gorbachev had ordered the troops disarmed, so they went in with
shovels, killing 19 demonstrators. The deaths sparked a national
outcry that was probably partly responsible for the retirement of a
former KGB chief from the ruling Politburo.
   Writer and historian Ales Adamovich, a progressive member of the
Congress of People's Deputies, said Gorbachev risks losing respect
because of his disdain of the use of force.
   ``Can you achieve anything in this country with his character,
mentality and psychology _ without a strong hand?'' he asked in an
article printed in the Moscow News. ``He risks being misunderstood
or just losing people's respect altogether. Remember, the people
had respect for Stalin!''
   ``Isn't there a risk that his personal democratism and
non-violence could be regarded as his weakness _ in a country
accustomed to a different style of leadership?'' Adamovich wrote.
   The deputy editor of the Moscow News, Vitaly Tretyakov, said the
Soviet leader relies so heavily on compromise as a political tool
that he sometimes blurs the line between what ultimately is
acceptable and what is not.
   Armenians and Azerbaijanis have bitterly criticized Gorbachev's
handling of the crisis that surrounds their conflicting claims to
the Nagorno-Karabakh territory.
   World chess champion Garri Kasparov, a resident of Baku whose
mother is Armenian, blamed Gorbachev's permissiveness for the
bloodletting.
   ``Everyone can decide for themselves, but what can one think of
a government that has permitted such horrendous events?'' he said
in an interview with a Spanish newspaper after fleeing Baku.
   Another Armenian refugee from Baku, Nelya Azerburyan,
interviewed in Moscow last week, said: ``Gorbachev never learned.
Instead of all this glasnost, he should have studied the Central
Asian people.''
   At least one Western military observer in Moscow agrees that
Gorbachev in the past has not acted forcefully enough.
   ``When you have people shooting at each other and killing each
other with guns and other hardware, you have to disarm them,'' he
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``To do that, you have to
kill some of them. If he's not willing to do that, he's not going
to stop the fighting.''
   It seems unlikely that the Soviet leader will respond with equal
force to peaceful demands for independence.
   Gorbachev last month withstood a barrage of demands from
conservative critics demanding he take tough action against the
non-violent but determined drive by Lithuanians to restore the
independence they lost to Stalin in 1940.
   The Communist Party chief argued Lithuanian leaders are taking
their republic down a dead-end path. He flew there to face them and
nationalist protesters, but he never threatened to use force to
stop their independence drive.

<HEAD>Many Farmers Highly Skeptical About Restrictions On Chemical Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study by the American Farmland Trust finds
that many farmers favor crop methods to protect the environment but
are highly skeptical of tougher federal restrictions on chemical
use.
   The private, non-profit conservation group said Sunday that
``substantial numbers of farmrs across the country are interested
in, and currently employing, a variety of environmentally benign,
sustainable agricultural practices.''
   But the report acknowledged that there are wide variations among
farmers, depending on the kinds of crops involved and on geographic
locations. For example, only 20 percent in one area used rotation
plans while the majority in other areas followed the soil-saving
practice.
   The project was based on personal interviews lasting for more
than an hour with 489 farmers randomly selected in five major
production areas in Butte County, Calif.; Whitman County, Wash.;
Renville County, Minn.; Livingston County, Ill.; and Dooly County,
Georgia.
   Questioners asked about methods used by the farmers in 1988, the
most recently completed crop season, including their views on the
potential environmental threats that might occur.
   The American Farmland Trust, which was founded in 1980, said it
did not design the questions or interpret results ``with any
hostility toward use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.''
   It said the study was undertaken in preparation for the 1990
farm bill debate under way in Congress. Environmental issues,
including potential hazards of agricultural chemical pollution, are
expected to have high priority.
   Over many years, report said, chemicals ``have brought great
benefits to American agriculture and consumers'' and are
``essential for financial viability'' in most farming situations
today.
   ``However, there is widespread evidence that an over-dependence
on (chemical) use has developed and much effort is today devoted to
seeking ways to enable farmers to economize on use of chemicals and
fertilizer,'' the report said.
   The Agriculture Department was one of the sponsors of the study,
although most of the financing came from private foundations. The
USDA currently is developing LISA, or ``low-input, sustainable
agriculture'' as an alternative to heavy use of crop chemicals and
other practices that jeopardize soil and water resources.
   Some research findings show that many farmers ``apply excessive
amounts of fertilizers or pesticides because they lack adequate
information about what their fields really need or because they use
very high applications as a form of insurance,'' the report said.
   ``Moreover,'' it added, ``in some situations, the threat or
actuality of ground water or surface water pollution is high enough
that a reduction in the use of chemicals may be necessary for
health reasons.''
   Crop rotation, long recognized as a way to build up soils, was
used by a majority of the farmers in four of the five areas, with
54 percent to 82 percent employing the practice in 1988, the report
said. The exception was in Butte County, Calif., where only 20
percent of those interviewed used rotations.
   Farmers were also asked whether they followed recommendations of
fertilizer dealers or those of the federal-state cooperative
extension service.
   ``Among interviewed farmers, there were many more clients of
fertilizer dealers than there were takers of advice from
cooperative extension service,'' the report said.
   Although 75 percent to 90 percent of the farmers favored changes
in USDA commodity programs that would permit planting more acres in
rotation without losing base acres used to compute federal crop
benefits, most drew the line at a regulatory crackdown on excessive
chemical use.
   One option would require farmers have an approved plan for
managing pesticide use if crop chemicals were found in their well
water. It was rejected in all five survey sites.

   Democratic reforms have swept out the Old
Guard in Eastern Europe, but its legacy lingers on in the foreign
intelligence agencies that continue to spy at home and abroad,
according to Western specialists.
   East European spies remain on the job, even though the security
and espionage agencies they serve now face reorganization under new
governments, the experts say.
   Authorities in East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland and
Bulgaria say security forces have a place even in open societies.
Traditionally these nations have combined internal security
operations with foreign espionage.
   But the exact size and mandate of the surviving services _ as
well as the fate of their foreign espionage networks _ is mostly
obscured by the traditional lack of public accountability.
   One new development is that under democratic leaders, some
cloak-and-dagger operations of the past, such as the 1978
assassination of Bulgarian writer and defector Georgi Markov, are
being denounced and investigated. But nowhere have espionage
agencies been totally disbanded.
   It is unclear what is happening to East Germany's formidable
foreign espionage department, but West Germans have expressed fears
that East German spies will use the open borders to slip into their
country.
   West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said East
Germany, for one, continues its foreign espionage activities.
   ``East Germany would be well advised to pull back its agents
even before a treaty on closer cooperation is signed,'' he said in
a recent interview, referring to the comprehensive treaty that is
supposed to be signed between the two states.
   ``There have been no indications that spying for East Berlin has
stopped. The Stasi department in charge of espionage is functioning
like it was during (deposed leader Erich) Honecker's time,'' the
Munich magazine Bunte quoted Schaeuble as saying.
   East Germany's opposition has made the abolition of the secret
service, or Stasi, the top issue in current opposition-government
talks. Last week, an angry East Berlin mob stormed and looted the
headquarters of the secret police.
   In Washington, CIA chief William Webster said in a speech Nov.
29, when only Romania was still untouched by reform, that Soviet
bloc espionage had increased.
   ``Around the world, our stations are reporting more aggressive
action, a more robust intelligence collection effort, more efforts
to recruit our embassy and intelligence personnel than we have seen
in a long time,'' Webster said.
   ``The stuff is changing so fast that people are working hard
just to keep up with it,'' said one source at Supreme Headquarters
Allied Powers, Europe.
   It is unclear whether the increasing independence emerging in
East European politics will spill over into the intelligence
agencies, which long have assisted the Soviet Union in its pursuit
of Western secrets and technology.
   The former chief of Hungary's State Security Service, Brig.-Gen.
Ferenc Pallagi, said in an interview published late last year that
taking orders on intelligence activities from the Kremlin is ``a
thing of the past.''
   Both Pallagi and his deputy, Brig.-Gen. Joszef Horvath, resigned
last week amid allegations the intelligence service spied on
opposition groups in advance of Hungary's March parliamentary
elections.
   Maj. Jozsef Vegvari, an officer in the security service, said
Friday that as late as August there was a Soviet adviser attached
to the Hungarian Interior Ministry, which runs the SSS.
   ``The KGB is active in Hungary for sure,'' he said. Vegvari
faces charges for revealing information to the political opposition
on surveillance by his own service.
   Romania's internal secret police, the Securitate, was dismantled
after the December revolution, but the former chief of the Romanian
intelligence service, Ion Pacepa, predicted Romania's espionage
will increase.
   ``They will steal technology, and now they will steal it much
more easily, because people in the West will want to help the
Romanians and will give them technology, and they will give it to
Moscow,'' said Pacepa, who defected to the United States a decade
ago.
   Under the new non-Communist dominated Czechoslovak government,
Interior Minister Richard Sacher announced last week that the STB,
the secret service charged with gathering information on
dissidents, had been disbanded.
   However, in an interview with the Czechoslovak news agency CTK,
Sacher said some Interior Ministry departments ``needed for the
defense of the state will also be needed in independent
Czechoslovakia.''
   He did not specify what their job would be.
   In Warsaw, sources within the Solidarity-led government have
told The Associated Press they are trying to strip Poland's Embassy
in Moscow of diplomats who worked for the Soviet intelligence
apparatus.
   Still relatively intact among the East bloc services is
Bulgaria's State Security, known by its Bulgarian initials DS.
   After the November ouster of hard-line Communist leader Todor
Zhivkov, the reform-minded leadership promised to publicize more
information on intelligence activities, as well as investigate the
murder by poison-tipped umbrella of Markov, the Bulgarian dissident
author killed in London in 12 years ago.
   There has long been speculation that the orders to kill Markov
came from Bucharest. The scandal forced the resignation last week
of Jozsef Horvath, head of the Internal Security Service.
   But although Bulgaria's new leadership is trying to cast off its
Stalinist image, the Bulgarian domestic surveillance and foreign
intelligence gathering operations appear to be continuing.
   ``What we know is that almost every Bulgarian who is doing some
job abroad is an agent or informant of DS, including diplomats,
journalists, and trade functionaries,'' said one Bulgarian exile
who monitors intelligence affairs and spoke in exchange for
anonymity.

<HEAD>Schools, Jobs for Women Sought to Hold Down Population</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More schools and more jobs for women would do
most to hold down massive growth in the numbers of people in the
Third World, a report by the Population Institute said Sunday.
   It found a link between ignorance and overpopulation.
   ``The population explosion is no longer a prediction. It's
already here,'' according to the institute, an advocacy group on
this issue.
   The study noted that last year, the world's population increased
by over 90 million people.
   Rich countries like the United States have ignorant people as
well as the Third World, though they are fewer. The report said
that among people in some industrial countries, one in 10 is
``functionally illiterate.'' That is, they can read and write some,
but they can not follow printed instructions or write a simple
letter.
   The report said about 900 million of the world's 5.5 billion
people cannot read, and that almost two out of every three
illiterates are women.
   ``In Sudan women with no formal education had, on average, 6.5
children,'' it said. ``But Sudanese women with four to six years of
school averaged five children and those with seven or more years of
school averaged 3.4 children.''
   ``In Mexico ... uneducated women had an average of eight
children but women with seven or more years of education averaged
2.7,'' the report said.
   The study reported that women who get only one or two years of
school tend to have more surviving childrern rather than fewer. It
suggested that was because even a little education helps a mother
keep her babies alive. Women who stay at school longer get married
later and know more about contraceptives.
   The study was prepared by Harold N. Burdett, the institute's
director of information, and Werner Fornos, its president.
   ``Nations that have opened up the schoolhouse and the workplace
to women have experienced uniform declines in their fertility
rates,'' Fornos said.
   At a news conference, he praised South Korea for its program to
give all girls eight years of school and to emphasize the textile
industry as a big employer of women.
   ``In Bangladesh ... high fertility rates have been slow to
decline and many girls are already married by the age of 13,'' the
report said.
   Bangladesh, where the average person has an income of $170 a
year, is one of the world's poorest countries.
   The report continued: ``By contrast, South Korea, a country of
42 million people which has made significant economic strides in
recent years, has a 1.4 percent annual growth rate _ the lowest of
any major developing nation in Asia _ and the average age at first
marriage has risen from 17.8 years several decades ago to
approximately 23 years today.''
   The World Bank put the average income in South Korea at $3,530
in 1988.
   Fornos also cited Mexico for encouraging industries along the
border that make goods for the United States. He said there are
about 900, ``some of them as big as football fields,'' where women
do 85 percent of the work on such jobs as assembling computer parts.
   He found 30 countries in the Third World in this kind of
restructuring: from Zimbabwe, trying like South Korea to keep girls
in school for eight years, to Indonesia, where ``Mothers' Clubs''
help women care for their babies and learn new skills.
   Fornos warned of what he called the ``aspiration bomb'' _ the
danger of educated young people turning to crime because they
cannot find jobs. He said he had seen the results in violent gangs
of young graduates now worrying Kenya, where authorities have
pushed education hard.
   The report pointed to Peru.
   ``The anger and frustration of young Peruvians who made
sacrifices to obtain an education only to end up unemployed and
disillusioned have resulted in drug addiction, delinquency and
radical politics for many,'' it said.

   College freshmen are becoming more
conservative about drugs and crime but more liberal about legalized
abortion, environmental issues and student activism, according to a
study released Sunday.
   The 24th annual survey of entering college freshmen conducted
jointly by UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute and the
American Council on Education found an ``abrupt change'' in student
attitudes about legalized abortions.
   Support for legalized abortion, which had remained fairly stable
_ between 53 percent and 59 percent _ since 1977, jumped sharply
between the 1988 and 1989 surveys, from 57 percent to 64.7 percent.
   ``An abrupt change in student attitudes of this magnitude in
just one year is most unusual,'' said Alexander W. Astin, professor
of higher education at UCLA's Graduate School of Education and the
survey's director.
   He added that ``it may well reflect the students' growing
concern about the current Supreme Court's position on this highly
charged topic.''
   The survey found the environment was the top concern, with six
out of every seven of those questioned agreeing that ``the federal
government is not doing enough to control environmental pollution.''
   And, 78.2 percent of the students endorsed greater governmental
efforts to control handguns _ a new question asked for the first
time in 1989.
   Support for abolition of the death penalty continued its sharp
decline, as did student use of drugs and alcohol. The survey found
a growing tendency toward greater student activism.
   ``While student attitudes seem to be moving in a `conservative'
direction on the issues of drugs and crime, their views on most
other issues are changing in a decidedly `liberal' direction,' said
Astin.
   The 1989 national survey is based on the responses of 216,362
students at 403 of the nation's two- and four-year colleges and
universities. These data have been statistically adjusted to
reflect the responses of the 1.6 million first-time, full-time
students entering college as freshmen in the fall of 1989.
   Key findings were:
   _Only 21.3 percent oppose the death penalty, compared to 23.0 in
1988 and 57.6 percent in 1971.
   _The percentage of freshmen who reported drinking beer dropped
to 60.3 percent, down from 65.3 percent in 1988 and 75.2 percent in
1981.
   _Freshmen who reported drinking wine or liquor dropped to 60.7
percent in 1989, compared to 66.7 percent in 1988.
   _The percentage of students who agree that ``marijuana should be
legalized'' reached another all-time low of 16.7 percent, down from
19.3 percent in 1988 and 52.9 percent in 1977.
   _The percent of students who agree that employers should be
allowed to require drug testing of employees and job applicants
jumped sharply from 71 percent to 77.8 percent between 1988 and
1989.
   According to the survey, the share of freshmen who participated
in organized demonstrations during the year prior to entering
college reached a high of 36.7 percent, which is greater than the
percentages observed during the last 1960s.
   At the same time, the percentage of freshmen who said that there
is a ``very good chance'' that they will participate in student
protests or demonstrations in college also reached an all-time high
of 6.3 percent, up from 5.4 percent in 1988 and 4.7 percent in 1967.
   An all-time high of 44.1 percent of students reported that it is
a ``very important'' goal for them to ``influence social values.''
This figure is up from 36 percent in 1987 and 31.1 percent in 1982.
   For the fifth consecutive year, student concern for the
environment increased with 86.3 percent of freshmen wanting better
federal efforts to control pollution, compared with 83.9 percent in
1988 and 80.9 percent in 1987.
   The survey showed that student interest in becoming involved in
programs to clean up the environment also increased, with 26.1
percent of the 1989 college freshmen saying that this is a ``very
important'' life goal, compared with only 15.9 percent in 1986.
   ``These trends show not only that most students want more
governmental action in the environmental field, but that increasing
numbers of them are willing to become personally involved in the
effort,''said Astin.

   District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry,
seeking treatment after his arrest on federal cocaine charges,
often tried to convey the image of a tough-on-drugs executive while
disputing reports he personally used narcotics.
   On a radio call-in show Sept. 17, 1987, Barry criticized a
federal prosecutor's decision to dismiss up to 400 drug cases
because the police officers who investigated them were suspected of
corruption.
   ``My view is that the judge ought to decide whether or not the
case ought to be thrown out or not prosecuted,'' Barry said.
``We're letting people who are poisoning our community almost
really go free. It sends the wrong signal to that community.''
   When traces of cocaine were discovered in the hotel room of
former city employee Charles Lewis after Barry visited him in
December 1988, the mayor said through a spokesman: ``I would never
knowingly associate with anybody using drugs or dealing with drugs.
Under no circumstances would I associate with anybody doing this.''
   On March 14, 1989, Barry and other city officials met with
William J. Bennett, head of the national drug control policy
office, and the mayor said that ``he and I agreed ... there will be
no quick fixes.'' He said he told Bennett the city needed more
money to expand drug treatment programs and stem drug-related
killings.
   Nine days later, he told the National Press Club: ``Drugs are
the problem, not Marion Barry. I urge the media to be fair.''
Talking about the growing crime wave, including record numbers of
homicides, he said:
   ``For the most part, the targeted killings and drug activity
take place in a small section of the city. Except for the killings,
Washington has one of the lowest crime rates in the country.
   ``Congress is safe; everyone is safe. I hope to come back here
next year and tell you Washington is safer than ever before.''
   In May 1989, after his administration came under fire for
failing to stem the increase in drug-related violence in the city,
the mayor arrived at an alleged crack house with eviction papers in
his hand and television cameras by his side, surprising 16 people
in the apartment and federal agents who had arrived an hour later
to serve a search warrant.
   Barry directed city workers to nail the apartment's windows and
doors shut, but Treasury Department agents tore down the plywood
boards when they arrived with the warrant. No one was arrested in
either raid.
   On April 4, 1989, testifying before the Senate appropriations
subcommittee on the District of Columbia, Barry outlined a $102
million plan for stemming drug-related violence, but Sen. Robert
Kerrey, D-Neb., dismissed it as a ``Chamber of Commerce document''
and accused the mayor of glossing over the city's problems.
   ``If I were to judge you on the job you're doing with drugs, and
I were given a vote, I wouldn't vote for you,'' Kerrey said. ``In
the absence of a community committed to solving the problem, no
amount of money would help.''

   Quincy Jones was awarded the French Legion
of Honor Sunday for his musical contribution as a trumpeter,
composer, arranger and record producer.
   In presenting the medal to Jones, Thierry de Beauce, secretary
of state for international cultural relations, called Jones ``a man
who reconciles the rhythms of rock, jazz and bop.''
   Jones, 56, is well known on both sides of the Atlantic. He first
came to France in 1953 at age 19 with Lionel Hampton's orchestra.
His career since then includes collaboration with some of America
and France's greatest artists _Aretha Franklin, George Benson,
Jacques Brel, Michel Legrand, Miles Davis, Ray Charles and Charles
Aznavour, to name a few.
   As a record producer, Jones was responsible for two of the most
successful albums of the 1980s _ Michael Jackson's ``Thriller'' and
``Bad.''
   After six years of dedicating himself to producing, Jones
released his own album, ``Back on the Block,'' which has risen to
16th place on U.S. charts since its December release.

   Former ``Mayflower Madam'' Sydney Biddle Barrows
has apologized for a paragraph in her new intimate etiquette book
that suggests dinner guests be told if someone with AIDS is at the
table.
   The publisher, Doubleday, said in a press release Saturday that
many have complained that the passage in the book ``Mayflower
Manners'' is insensitive.
   ``Most people will know that they cannot contract the disease by
being seated at a dinner table with a carrier,'' Miss Barrows
wrote. ``But it is a courtesy to all to let them know ahead of
time.''
   Miss Barrows said in the release, ``My advice was intended to
protect the feelings of such a guest from the ignorance of those
who might inadvertently bring up a subject, causing discomfort to
the guest. I intended no other meaning or inference.''
   She said the passage would be deleted in future printings.
   The book by Ellis Weiner and Miss Barrows is described by the
publisher as ``a satirical and tongue-in-cheek advice book.''
   Miss Barrows, a member of a prominent socialite family who ran a
high-price escort service, pleaded guilty in 1985 to a misdemeanor
charge of promoting prostitution and paid a $5,000 fine. She was
dubbed the ``Mayflower Madam'' because she traces some of her
ancestors to the group that came over on the Mayflower.

   Despite his run-ins with General Motors Corp.
after the giant automaker bought his Electronic Data Systems,
Dallas billionaire Ross Perot said he did not revel in a new
movie's stinging criticism of GM Chairman Roger Smith.
   ``I get no sense of comfort in foreseeing what is happening to
GM,'' Perot told the Dallas Times Herald after seeing ``Roger &amp;
Me,'' which documents the impact of GM layoffs on Flint, Mich.
   ``The film was hard on Roger. He's really a bright and creative
guy,'' Perot said.
   Perot said the movie is a must-see film because it vividly shows
what could happen to U.S. business if companies do not change their
approach to competition from the Far East.
   ``When you watch `Roger &amp; Me' and you're seeing American
companies deteriorate, remember that you're looking at the nuking
of our tax base,'' Perot said.

   Michael Landon, who played Little Joe
Cartwright in the long-running TV series ``Bonanza,'' can kick up
his cowboy boots at his new ranch that took a decade to build.
   Landon, who also starred in ``Little House on the Prairie'' and
``Highway to Heaven,'' traded an oceanfront residence at
celebrity-saturated Malibu Colony for a ranch estate in bucolic
Bonsall Canyon.
   The actor-director-producer bought the property 10 years ago as
a place to relax with his family.
   Landon, 52, has seven grown children from two previous marriages
and has two young children with his current wife, Cindy.
   ``They didn't anticipate that it would become their home, but as
we designed the plans, it developed from a ranch to an estate that
has the old Bel-Air or Pasadena look,'' said architect Robert Earl.
   Industry sources estimate the value of the ranch at $7 million,
the Los Angeles Times reported.

   He tried to tell Washington, says David
Funderburk, but during four years as ambassador to Romania he
couldn't convince anyone that Nicolae Ceausescu was a murderous
tyrant undeserving of American favors.
   ``It was like beating my head against a brick wall,'' Funderburk
said in an interview from his home in Buies Creek, N.C., where he
now runs an anti-communist foundation.
   ``We reported what was really happening and the whole litany of
horrors that Ceausescu was carrying out, but my reports weren't
reaching the top people and they certainly weren't being factored
into our relationship.''
   Funderburk, 45, a former college teacher fluent in Romanian,
says he knows why: when President Reagan appointed him in 1981, he
was regarded by the State Department as a protege of Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., the department's nemesis.
   Now, of course, the world knows that Funderburk's descriptions
were accurate. Ceausescu ran a police state. His people were
virtually starved while Romanian farm products were sent abroad.
Women were penalized if they refused to have babies. Clergymen and
opponents were killed. Every typewriter had to be registered.
   The United States, Funderburk said, is still following a
wrongheaded policy in Romania, backing Ceausescu's successor,
communist Ion Iliescu, head of the National Salvation Front
government.
   ``We ought to be offering our moral support to the outmanned
non-communists,'' he said.
   During the Nixon Administration, the United States had seen a
streak of independence in Ceausescu. To encourage other communists
to inch away from Moscow, Romania was given most favored nation
trade status and Ceausescu was showered with attention.
   Presidents Nixon and Ford and other high officials visited,
offering praise for Ceausescu's ``courage.'' Nixon and President
Carter lavishly welcomed him to Washington.
   Funderburk said George Bush, who was then vice president;
Alexander M. Haig, who was secretary of state; and businessmen who
wanted to trade with Romania ``trekked over to Bucharest to do
homage to Ceausescu.''
   He said he asked the visitors to press Ceausescu to honor his
human rights commitments but they ``had been told to just ignore
Funderburk.''
   Career diplomat Francis B. Corry, assigned as Funderburk's
deputy, confirmed that the ambassador was persona non grata in the
State Deparment.
   ``He had the reputation _ not entirely deserved _ of being a
protege of Jesse Helms,'' said Corry, who has since retired.
   Corry added that ``Helms' relationship with the Department of
State being what it was, there was little David Funderburk could do
to help his relationship with the department.''
   As for the kid gloves policy toward Ceausescu, Corry said: ``Was
the policy of differentiation, which was conceived in Kissingerian
times, wise? An argument could be made either way.
   ``We never got a hell of a lot of true independence from
Ceausescu. How could they be independent with a 1,500-kilometer
border with the Soviet Union?''
   On the other hand, Corry said, ``I felt _ and in this I agreed
with the department _ that having extended most favored nation
status, pulling it back would remove whatever leverage we had with
Ceausescu.''
   The Romanian dictator had demonstrated a degree of maverick
behavior. He maintained ties with West Germany, refused to break
relations with Israel after the Six-Day War, refused to boycott the
1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, and declined to back Soviet
interventions in Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan.
   Moreover, tens of thousands of Jews were allowed to leave. It
later turned out Ceausescu had received thousands of dollars from
Israel for each emigre.
   Funderburk argued Ceausescu's independence was a ploy. ``Behind
the scenes he was collaborating with the Soviets'' and sharing the
Western techology he was allowed to import, he advised Washington.
   Unable to budge the State Department, Funderburk said he used
his influence with conservatives to arrange a 1983 Oval Office
meeting with Ronald Reagan.
   ``The president seemed sympathetic and surprised, but unless he
heard the same message day after day he wasn't about to act against
his own secretary of state,'' Funderurk said. Thus, the
``groveling'' continued.
   The department, furious that he had gone around channels,
undertook to force him out as ambassador, Funderburk said. Finally,
in 1985, he quit in frustration, he said.
   Funderburk said he remains appalled at U.S. policy. ``We rushed
in with a new ambassador and recognized the provisional government.
Most of those characters are people who worked with Ceausescu. Here
we are propping up a communist government composed of people the
people hate. We don't learn anything.''

<HEAD>Pope to Visit Czechoslovakia in Second Half of April</HEAD>

   Pope John Paul II will visit Czechoslovakia in the
second half of April, and diplomatic relations between Prague and
the Vatican could be restored before then, Czechoslovak officials
said Sunday.
   It will be John Paul's first voyage to an Eastern European
country other than his native Poland, marking another breakthrough
in ties between the Vatican and Soviet bloc nations that have shed
their hard-line Communist leaders.
   A Czechoslovak government delegation issued the invitation to
the pope Saturday on behalf of President Vaclav Havel and Cardinal
Frantisek Tomasek, the archbishop of Prague and the Roman Catholic
primate of Czechoslovakia.
   The Vatican reported Saturday that the pope had accepted the
invitation but said only that the trip would take place sometime
before the Czechoslovak elections in June.
   Jan Carnogursky, first deputy prime minister and head of the
government delegation, told a news conference the pope will visit
Prague, Velehrad and Bratislava in the last half of April.
   He said final details were still being worked out and he could
not confirm some published reports in Italy and Hungary that the
trip would begin April 21.
   Carnogursky said the government invited the pope as a ``great
moral authority, as head of the Catholic faith which has millions
of followers in Czechoslovakia, and as a major personality in
today's world.''
   ``All three aspects symbolize the dimension of the changes
realized in Czechoslovakia recently,'' he said.
   Carnogursky said the new Czechoslovak government wants to
re-establish diplomatic relations with the Holy See ``as soon as
possible'' and that the pope and Vatican Secretary of State
Agostino Casaroli agreed. Ties were broken by Czechoslovakia in
1949.
   The official said an announcement on resumption of diplomatic
ties could come soon after the appointment of new Roman Catholic
bishops in March. Five of the country's 13 bishoprics are vacant.
   The former Communist regime blocked some of the Vatican's
appointments, but Carnogursky said the new government would pose
``no obstacles or problems'' to the naming of new bishops.
   The Czechoslovak Parliament on Tuesday will abolish a 1949
decree requiring government approval of bishops' appointments, thus
giving the Holy See a free hand to name its own candidates, the
officials said.
   ``The intention of the new democratic government is that there
be freedom of religion,'' said Josef Hromadka, deputy prime
minister with responsibility for religious affairs.
   As recently as two years ago, the pope decried the ``sorry
state'' of the church in Czechoslovakia, where an estimated 60
percent of the 15 million people are Roman Catholics. But
improvements were made last year, even before the opposition
victory that ended the Communists' 41-year domination of the
government.
   The Vatican is also expected to re-estalish relations with
Hungary shortly. The pope is scheduled to travel to Hungary in
September 1991.
   Last July, Poland became the first Warsaw Pact country to
restore full ties with the Holy See.

   Stung by the loss of two top House Democrats
and the problems of five senators embroiled in a savings and loan
furor, congressional leaders are weighing a substantial revamping
of campaign finance laws.
   A bipartisan House task force is at work on the problem and
Senate leaders seem determined to watch what the House does before
acting on their own. Complicating prospects for passage is the fact
that all 435 members of the House and a third of the Senate are up
for re-election this year.
   Still, Speaker Thomas S. Foley was able on Sunday to predict
passage of a reform bill in the House.
   ``I think it's going to happen in this session ... at least in
the House,'' the Washington Democrat said on NBC's ``Meet the
Press.''
   Congress historically has been reluctant to legislate in this
politically touchy area, especially in an election year, and this
issue has been bogged down in partisan argument since early 1988.
   Yet, pressure is building, thanks largely to the political
brouhaha surrounding Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr. and
the five senators to whom he gave $1.3 million in campaign and
other contributions in his fight with savings and loan regulators.
   The five senators _ Alan Cranston, D-Calif., Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., John McCain, R-Ariz., John Glenn, D-Ohio, and Donald W.
Riegle, D-Mich. _ are now subjects of Senate Ethics Committee
inquiries for interceding with S&amp;L regulators on Keating's behalf.
   This political firestorm, which ignited last year after House
Speaker Jim Wright and Democratic Whip Tony Coelho resigned amid
ethics problems, has given impetus to the fight for campaign
finance reform.
   ``With the exception of Watergate, I can't remember a single
incident that has educated people all over the country on the real
price that is paid in a campaign financing system that allows money
to be used for buying influence,'' said Fred Wertheimer, head of
the self-styled citizens lobby, Common Cause.
   A 21-member bipartisan House task force has been instructed by
Foley and Republican Leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois to have a
bill ready as soon as possible after Congress returns Tuesday.
   No specific date was set, but congressional officials working on
the package said the clear intent of Foley's directions was to have
a bipartisan package prepared for a vote in March.
   In the Senate, Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine and
GOP Leader Bob Dole of Kansas discussed setting up a similar task
force after Congress adjourned last month.
   While Senate leaders want to see what the House does first
before producing a package of their own, the leader of the last
failed reform effort, Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., is working with
McCain _ one of the ``Keating Five'' _ on a bipartisan proposal.
   Wertheimer's organization, which advocates spending limits and
federal financing of campaigns, filed the initial complaint with
the ethics panel last October. This forced the inquiries into the
five senators' intervention with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
on behalf of Keating's now-collapsed Lincoln Savings and Loan,
based in Irvine, Calif.
   All five senators have denied they intervened with the bank
board in the Lincoln case because of Keating's contributions. The
five said they often intercede with federal agencies on behalf of
constituents who are not contributors.
   Just how much ``reform'' will be in a campaign finance bill that
can win both Democratic and Republican support _ and not pose a
serious threat to the careers of incumbent lawmakers _ is in doubt.
   Common Cause has dropped its demand for public financing of the
type used in presidential campaigns since the passage of the last
significant campaign money law in 1974 following the Watergate
scandal.
   Public financing and voluntary spending ceilings, wanted by
Democrats but opposed by Republicans, stymied the last reform
effort in 1987-88.
   After Congress adjourned with the Keating controversy fresh in
its mind, Michel told the National Press Club he would give
``personal consideration to some type of cap,'' indicating a
softening in the GOP's historic opposition to spending ceilings.
   Instead of offering government campaign dollars to candidates
who abide by voluntary spending ceilings _ compulsory caps are
illegal under a Supreme Court decision _ Democrats are talking of
using discount mail and TV advertising rates as a carrot for
compliance.
   So-called ``soft money'' contributions, which go to national and
state party organizations or independent groups and foundations
utilized by members of Congress, remain a major stumbling block.
   Most of those contributions do not now have to be reported to
the Federal Election Commission and only a few states, such as
California, require their disclosure. Keating contributed $85,000
each to Republican and Democratic party committees in California,
where Lincoln's 29 thrift branches operated.
   Republican members of Congress, who rely on their party more
than Democrats for raising election money, are opposed to any
measure that would curb that ability. But they want to restrict
business, trade association and labor PACs that increasingly are
becoming the biggest source of cash for incumbent Democrats.
   ``There's always support for campaign finance reform in general,
but when it comes down to specifics, that's where everything breaks
down,'' said Ross Baker, a campaign finance expert at Rutgers
University.
   Until Republicans get over their distaste for public financing
and Democrats give up their love affair with PACs, he said, the
best reform would be requiring more disclosure.
   ``The ultimate sanction against a candidate who takes too much
money _ or money from the wrong people _ is that an opponent can
use it as an issue,'' he said. ``That's the great dagger hanging
over the heads of those five senators.''
   None of the ``Keating Five,'' however, is among the 33 senators
up for re-election this year.

   For the past 13 years, Robert Randall has made
regular trips to a pharmacy to get, legally and free, what many
others buy on the street at the risk of arrest _ marijuana.
   Randall was the first person allowed by the federal government
to use the drug for medical purposes, in his case as a treatment
for the blinding eye disease glaucoma, under what is termed a
``compassionate'' protocol.
   Others have received permission to use marijuana legally for
controlling nausea caused by anti-cancer drugs, for pain relief and
for controlling muscle spasms in people with multiple sclerosis.
   But Randall says it's easier for patients to get the drug in an
illegal street sale than through the legitimate but time-consuming
and bureaucratic process that allows government-grown marijuana to
be distributed free by prescription as an experimental drug.
   ``It's an extraordinary process to engage in. It stretches the
word `compassionate' to the limit,'' Randall said an interview last
week at his Washington home. ``I've watched one or two people go
blind while waiting.''
   Only four other people _ two with glaucoma, one with cancer and
one with AIDS _ currently are receiving marijuana from the
government, said Randall, president of the Alliance for Cannabis
Therapeutics.
   The Food and Drug Administration did not know how many people
have gotten marijuana under a ``compassionate'' protocol, but a
spokesman said at least two dozen protocols _ some covering groups
of patients _ have been approved since Randall's in 1976. Most of
the protocols now are inactive, either because patients have died
or have switched to other drugs.
   The process starts with a request from a physician for
authorization to prescribe marijuana for a patient. If the FDA
approves the physician's plans, the request goes to the National
Institute for Drug Abuse, which is responsible for growing the drug
on a Mississippi farm.
   After NIDA certifies it has a supply of the drug, the request
goes to the Drug Enforcement Administration, which must assure
tight control over distribution of the drug.
   Randall's group and the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws went to court again on Friday to try to force the
DEA to change marijuana's status as a Schedule I drug, which is
available only for research, to a Schedule II drug, which would
make it available for patient use, as morphine and cocaine are.
   A DEA administrative law judge in 1988 recommended that
marijuana be reclassified, but DEA Administrator John Lawn rejected
the recommendation Dec. 29, saying the judge ignored the scientific
evidence.
   Randall said Lawn's action ignores the pain of the ill solely to
``promote his political agenda,'' the war against illegal drugs.
   ``For me, marijuana is just another medication,'' Randall said,
adding that the only effect he gets from the drug is therapeutic _
it reduces the pressure inside his eye, helping him retain his
vision.
   Randall, who turns 42 on Tuesday, gets by prescription 300
neatly rolled marijuana cigarettes a month and smokes 10 of them
each day. He said he hasn't gotten high from the drug for years,
partly because of the low potency of government-grade marijuana.
   The American Academy of Ophthalmology Committee on Drugs says
that while marijuana can lower intraocular pressure, there is no
evidence the drug can safely and effectively lower it enough to
prevent optic nerve damage.
   Besides the long-term lung damage that can occur from smoking
the drug, short-term side effects include euphoria, low blood
pressure and eye dryness, the committee said. The panel said
long-term studies are needed.
   Dr. Keith Green, a regents professor of ophthalmology at the
Medical College of Georgia in Augusta, Ga., who has studied
marijuana, said better drugs than marijuana are available for
glaucoma patients.
   ``If this were a worthwhile venture, there would be much greater
utilization and recommendation of its use by the physicians in the
(ophthalmology) community,'' Green said.
   But Dr. Ivan Silverberg, a medical oncologist in San Francisco,
said that among cancer and AIDS patients, ``there's still a lot of
interest'' in using marijuana to control nausea and pain.
   ``Patients use it all the time,'' he said. ``It's very common in
the Bay Area,'' among older as well as younger patients.
   He added that while ``this is not the greatest drug known to
man,'' it is ``the most effective of the out-patient drugs'' for
controlling nausea because patients can get relief in a matter of
seconds without having to swallow a pill and keep it down for 30 to
90 minutes. Also, smoking allows a patient better dose control
because they can stop when they get relief, he said.
   Silverberg said he's not willing to go through the steps needed
to get permission to prescribe marijuana for patients because the
government's process is too time-consuming and patients who want it
can easily get it.
   ``I don't prescribe it, I don't smoke it, and I don't have a
reputation as a pot doctor,'' Silverberg said. But, he added, ``if
I think a patient is going to be nauseated, we'll talk about it.''

<TEXT>
   More than 2,000 students rallied in
Bucharest on Sunday to demand an end to the last vestiges of
Communist rule _ from incompetent professors to the ideological
institute that trained past officials.
   The protesters outside Bucharest University booed the mention of
the former Communist Youth Union and chanted ``Liberty!'' and
``Solidarity!'' as a string of speakers called for students to
become a force in building a new, democratic Romania.
   Loud applause greeted Eduard Cucu, a student from the northern
city of Iasi, as he announced: ``We have organized to get rid of
incompetent teachers and the teachers who told the security forces
what was going on.''
   Last week, students at Bucharest's sprawling Polytechnic
University began a campaign to rid the student body of police
informers and professors who obtained their posts through party
affiliation.
   The Bucharest University administration is considering whether
to fire Mihaela Ceausescu, a niece of executed dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu, from her post as a professor of Russian.
   It was common under the Ceausescu regime for doctorates to be
awarded on the basis of party standing rather than academic
qualifications.
   The students repeatedly broke into chants of ``Down with the
incompetents!'' during the more than two-hour demonstration.
   The loudest jeering and booing came when philosophy student
Daniel Oghina spoke out against the Stefan Gheorghiu Social and
Political Academy, which trained many of the officials in
Ceausescu's dreaded Securitate secret police force.
   The academy served as the ideological training school for all
Ceausescu's officials and was a necessary gate to further
advancement in both the party and the government under the
dictator. Ceausescu was elected by firing squad Christmas Day.
   Oghina said authorities want to keep the institute going and
give it the ironic ``new title of the Free Academy of Stefan
Gheorghiu.'' Gheorghiu was a pre-war Communist leader in Romania.
   ``They're repeating the same structures of the old regime,'' he
said.
   The interim government's plans for the academy could not
immediately be determined.
   Some of the speakers also complained of the actions of the
governing National Salvation Front, which took over after the
revolution that ousted Ceausescu. One sign held by demonstrators
read ``Down with the Securitate people in the new government.''
   ``We want the provisional government to be formed of people who
will represent the Romanian people,'' student Dan Josef told the
crowd, which blocked Nicolae Balcescu Boulevard, one of the main
streets of Bucharest.
   Dumitru Mazilu, vice president of the National Salvation Front,
has come under fire since the revolution for reportedly holding a
colonel's rank in the Securitate during the 1970s.
   After falling from favor in the Ceausescu regime, he became one
of the nation's most internationally known dissidents.
   The National Salvation Front has so far defended Mazilu,
pointing to his conversion to a human rights advocate and critic of
the Ceausescu regime.
   Sunday's demonstration came a month after bloody fighting in
Bucharest, some of it along the same boulevard where the students
gathered.
   After a moment of silence for the thousands of people who died
in the revolution, the crowd held their hands up in victory signs
and sang the formerly banned song ``Awake Romania,'' a nationalist
song dating from the Turkish domination of the nation, which ended
in the late 19th century.
   The song starts ``Awake Romania from your mortal sleep that the
barbarians and tyrants put you in ... We'd rather die in glorious
battle than become slaves again.''
   Most of the demonstration, however, was made up of speakers
calling on students to unify.
   Several French students also spoke to the crowd, raising chants
of ``Vive la Roumanie!'' and ``Vive la France.!'
   One French student, who did not give his name, told the
Romanians: ``You gave us a lesson in democracy ... For this, we
thank you.''

<HEAD>Governing Party to Band with Opposition Groups in South Korea</HEAD>

   &equals;
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Roh Tae-woo has agreed to
dissolve his governing party to create a new conservative party in
alliance with two moderate opposition groups, top politicians said
Sunday.
   Roh also has agreed to revise the constitution to replace the
country's present presidential system of government with a
parliamentary system to be headed by a prime minister, the
officials said.
   The plan is designed to break a deadlock in the legislature,
which is controlled by three opposition parties whose strong
rivalries have prevented them from working together against the
governing party.
   The plan would also dwarf the nation's most radical opposition
party, the Party for Peace and Democracy, and its charismatic
leader, Kim Dae-jung.
   In addition, the parliamentary system would allow Roh the chance
to remain in power as prime minister after his five-year term as
president ends in 1993.
   Those familiar with the agreement said it will be formalized at
a meeting Monday between Roh, Kim Young-sam, leader of the No. 2
opposition group, the Reunification Democratic Party, and Kim
Jong-pil, a former premier who heads the No. 3 opposition group,
the New Democratic Republican Party.
   Kim Jong-pil said the three-way talks will formally announce the
creation of a new conservative party. ``Everything has been set for
the new party,'' he told a meeting of party lawmakers Sunday night.
   He said five delegates from each party will begin working
together Tuesday to prepare for the new party, expected to emerge
about a month later.
   An official in the governing Democratic Justice Party said that
the three parties agreed during weeks of private discussions to
create a new party and to change the constitution to adopt a
Cabinet system of government.
   They also agreed that the new party to be formed will try to
comprise ``all liberal democratic forces,'' said the official, who
requested anonymity.
   Insiders said Roh agreed to the realignment, initiated by the
two opposition parties, after Kim Young-sam reversed himself and
agreed to support changing from a presidential system to a cAbinet
system of government.
   The new party could be a serious setback for Kim Dae-jung,
leader of the hard-line opposition Party for Peace and Democracy.
His party would be dwarfed by the new party, thus limiting his
chances of coming to power.
   The governing party may have agreed to the realignment because
it has no clear successor to Roh, whose single fiver-year term
expires in 1993.
   Governing party officials have made it clear they hope to
imitate Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party, which has long
remained in power under a Cabinet system of government.
   Roh's governing party has been in an uncomfortable situation
since it lost a parliamentary majority in the 1988 general
elections. The three main opposition parties have a combined
majority in the 299-member National Assembly but intense rivalry
has made it difficult for them to cooperate.
   The new party to be formed is expected to have a collective
leadership with Roh serving as a ceremonial head.
   A merger of the three parties will also assure it of a two-third
majority required in parliament to introduce the constitutional
revision.
   Insiders said the new party would push a constitutional revision
during the term of the current assembly, which expires in May,
1992. A constitutional draft adopted in Parliament must be approved
in a national referendum.
   Even if a new constitution is adopted, Roh's term, which expires
in February 1993, is expected to be completed by him.

<TEXT>
   Health Minister Claude Evin has added his name to
the list of prominent Europeans threatening to boycott an AIDS
meeting in San Francisco unless the U.S. Congress changes a law
they say ``stupidly discriminates'' against AIDS victims.
   Evin, in a letter to World Health Organization secretary-general
Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, condemned the U.S. immigration law that he
said ``discriminates on the basis of health.'' He said he will not
attend the huge Sixth International Conference on AIDS to be held
June 20-24 in San Francisco ``in the absence of guarantees
respecting individual liberty.''
   Evins' letter was dated Jan. 13, and its contents were carried
Friday by the news agency Agence France-Presse.
   WHO is one of the sponsors of the prestigious meeting, which
each year draws doctors, researchers, health officials and
representatives from many of the world's most respected health
organizations.
   At least 16 organizations from France, Scandinavia, Britain and
elsewhere have announced that they plan to boycott the meeting
unless the U.S. government changes a policy that prohibits people
suffering AIDS from entering the United States without a special
waiver.
   Those granted the waiver have their passports stamped with a
permanent number indicating they are infected with the HIV virus
that causes the deadly disease.
   Critics complain the law violates an individual's right to
privacy, punishes the honest, makes the individual vulnerable to
discrimination at home, and is not justified on public health
grounds.
   ``To us Europeans, this seems a profoundly shocking policy,
especially in light of America's well-publicized belief in freedom
and respect for human rights. It stupidly discriminates and deeply
contradicts America's stated values,'' said Henri Maurel, spokesman
for the French group APARTS, which assists people with acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   Since the early 1950s, the United States has required that
people requesting an entry visa declare if they are infected with
contagious diseases such as syphillis, leprosy or tuberculosis. The
question has not been uniformly applied and was not asked at all of
travelers coming from countries that do not require visas, like
Canada.
   In 1987, under a measure introduced by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
AIDS was added to the list. Critics claim that immigration
officials then went on a campaign to ferret out people suffering
from AIDS, even going through luggage looking for medicine used to
treat the disease.
   ``Our end is not to stay away from this important meeting,''
said Manon Fournerie, spokeswoman for France-AIDS. ``What we want
is to call attention to the problem and for the United States to
change this discriminatory law.''
   Protests of the law have come from the international societies
of the Red Cross, the World Health Organization, the World
Federation of Hemophilia and the National Commission on AIDS. The
commission makes recommendations to the U.S. Congress and president
to develop a consistent national policy on fighting AIDS.
   ``The way you deal with AIDS is by educating the population, not
by sealing off the border,'' said Dr. June E. Osborn, head of the
National Commission on AIDS and chairman of the University of
Michigan School of Public Health.
   Osborn, in a telephone interview, pointed out that unlike some
infectious diseases, AIDS is spread by specific, controllable
behavior.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   ``The policy is ill-conceived and irrational,'' she said.
``Those who are aware they have the disease and are under treatment
are the least likely to be any threat.''
   Only Congress can rescind the law.
   In an effort to deal with the criticism, meetings have been held
over the last few weeks by the agencies involved in administering
it, including the Justice Department, State Department and
Department of Health and Human Services.
   American health officials fear there is not enough time before
the meeting in San Francisco for Congress to make sufficient
changes in the law to satisfy critics.

   An ex-convict charged with sexually
mutilating a small boy is scheduled to go on trial Monday as major
legislation sparked by public outrage at the crime moves toward
passage at the state legislature.
   Prosecutors say they will seek a life sentence for Earl Kenneth
Shriner, 39, if he is convicted on charges he raped and tried to
kill the child by severing his penis and choking him during an
attack May 20.
   The child, then 7, was wandering naked and dazed when he was
found by his mother and grandmother near his home in woods where
the attack occurred.
   Shriner has pleaded innocent to two counts of rape and one count
each of first-degree assault and first-degree attempted murder.
   The boy is scheduled to testify.
   ``He doesn't say much, but I can tell by his actions that he
would rather run away and hide, but he's also ready to turn and
face the problem because he realizes running and hiding isn't the
way to end it for him,'' said his mother, Helen Harlow.
   The child is back in school, and ``doing all the things normal
little boys do,'' his mother said. He faces the second of two
operations to repair the damage inflicted by his assailant's knife,
and ``will be restored to normal functions in every way,'' Ms.
Harlow said.
   The child's medical, psychiatric, and other costs are being paid
from a trust fund of $600,000 formed from donations that poured in
from all over the country, said Ms. Harlow. She has no access to
the fund herself and lives off earnings from a part-time job.
   The case enraged the public, and led Gov. Booth Gardner to form
a special panel that drafted legislation to snare more ``sex
predators.''
   The measure, heading for unusually quick and almost certain
passage in this election year, toughens sex-offender sentences ans
creates a procedure to indefinitely commit highly violent offenders
through a civil procedure after they have served their criminal
sentences. It also requires sex offenders to register with county
sheriffs for from 10 to 15 years, and permits authorities to warn
communities when an offender is in their midst.
   The bill was introduced after the legislature convened Jan. 8
and is due for a vote on the Senate floor Monday.
   Three legislators also are pushing measures authorizing surgical
castration of incorrigible sex offenders.
   Gardner's $17 million package, elements of which have been
blasted by the American Civil Liberties Union as ``totalitarian
concepts,'' was a direct result of the Shriner case, said state
Rep. Marlin Appelwick, who heads the House Judiciary Committee.
   Other crimes also spurred support for the measure: the 1988
slaying of a Seattle woman by a known sex offender later sentenced
to life; the killings of three boys in Vancouver, Wash., last
summer, allegedly by a known child molester still facing trial; and
the killing of a female jogger last fall in Whatcom County. Police
have announced no suspects in the jogger's death.
   ``My only regret is it took this tragedy with this little boy to
get us all to take such a serious look at the damage sex offenders
are doing, and when even worse atrocities are happening to women
every day,'' Appelwick said. ``It's too bad it took a male victim
to get everybody's attention.''
   Shriner is being held in lieu of $1 million bail. One of his
attorneys, public defender Lloyde Alton, has complained that the
tidal wave of publicity threatens his client's right to an
impartial jury. The defense won the right to pick the jury in
another county and bring the panel to Tacoma, where it will be
sequestered.
   Shriner completed a 10-year prison term for kidnap and assault
of two teen-age girls shortly before the attack on the boy.
   Officials testified at recent legislative hearings that they
knew Shriner was likely to commit sex crimes upon release, but
under Washington law, had no way to confine him after he served his
sentence.
   Prison officials told legislators they found drawings and
diaries in Shriner's prison cell ``with detailed plans'' to
sexually assault children. Superior Court Judge Thomas Sauriol
ruled against use of the material by the prosecution, which will
rely on the boy's testimony and on hair and blood samples, among
other things, prosecutors said.

<HEAD>More Partisan Budget Year Likely as Bush Readies Spending Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is bracing for partisan budget fights
over defense spending, the Social Security system and tax breaks as
President Bush prepares to unveil his proposed 1991 fiscal plan at
month's end.
   Bush's budget, which sources say will call for $1.24 trillion in
spending, is already being panned by Democrats who control Congress
for its expected embrace of assorted dogeared Republican proposals
to save money. These include eliminations or reductions of domestic
programs like mass transit aid and energy assistance to the poor.
   ``This will be a dinosaur budget, a warm-over of what we've seen
before,'' Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.,
said recently. ``It will be the whole laundry list that Congress
hasn't accepted for nine years.''
   For their part, Republicans are already showing that they will
not be bashful about pushing their own budgetary agenda this year.
In a speech last week, Bush referred to ``demagogues'' who are
opposing his resurrected proposal to cut the tax rate on capital
gains, which he claims will raise money for government coffers.
   The higher pitched political rhetoric is being fanned by the
fact that this is an election year. With the entire House and
one-third of the Senate up for re-election in November, members of
the two parties plan to use the budget to show voters what they
stand for _ and how they differ from their opponents.
   ``Both parties will be jockeying for position,'' foresees House
Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif. ``Democrats will
be pushing for increased initiatives on human needs, and
Republicans will be trying to protect their `No new taxes' pledge.
Frankly both positions together aren't going to help'' speed the
budget process.
   The budget year that Bush launches when he submits his spending
blueprint to Congress on Jan. 29 is expected to be have three major
battlefields. Each contest will shape a crucial part of the savings
mix the president needs to heed the Gramm-Rudman law's requirement
for a projected deficit next year of no more than $64 billion.
   Bowing to deficit pressures and to diminishing tensions with the
Eastern bloc, Bush plans to call for $303 billion in defense
spending, which would be 2 percent less than necessary to keep this
year's $297 billion level abreast of inflation.
   Democrats, with liberals such as Reps. George Miller, D-Calif.,
and Barney Frank, D-Mass., leading the way, are already saying
Bush's cut is not deep enough. Even the more moderate Sasser says
he would like to see military spending reduced to about $295
billion.
   With Democrats holding majorities in the House and Senate, the
only questions seem to be how large the so-called ``peace
dividend'' will be, and where the savings will go. The majority
party is split over the latter, with liberals urging an expansion
of ailing domestic programs like education and health, and others
hoping to use the savings to lower the deficit.
   Another fight will be over the huge surpluses the Social
Security system is running.
   There is bipartisan consensus that the surplus does little more
than hide the true size of the overall deficit, which was $152
billion last year but would have been $204 billion without the
Social Security windfall. The dispute arises over what to do about
it.
   Although opinions on the issue cross party lines, Republicans
tend to couple removal of the Social Security surpluses from
deficit calculations with an extension of the Gramm-Rudman law.
That legislation, which mandates a balanced budget in 1993 and then
expires, tends to keep domestic spending down. Most Democrats
oppose a Gramm-Rudman extension.
   A wild card is a proposal by Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., who
wants to lower the 7.65 percent payroll tax employers and workers
pay to support Social Security. The plan puts Bush in the
uncomfortable position of opposing a tax cut, but opponents say the
reduction would jeopardize the savings needed to pay Baby Boomers'
retirement benefits.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., in his first public
statement on the plan, said Sunday he would vote against the plan
if he had to vote on it now. He called for the proposal to be
studied ``very carefully.''
   Also likely to cause a clash is Bush's capital gains reduction
plan. Democrats, who say the proposal is actually a money-loser,
narrowly defeated it in 1989 after a bitter political clash, but
concede that the measure will likely be enacted this year.
   A fight will evolve as Democrats struggle to win something in
return, perhaps an improved individual retirement account to
benefit the middle- and lower-class.
   Other elements of the year's budget clash should sound familiar.
   Chief among them will be questions over the administration's
economic projections. The better the economic forecast, the more
revenues the government can expect to collect and the lower the
anticipated deficit.
   Administration sources say they will project next year's
economic growth to be about 2.6 percent, well above the amount many
private economists expect. Since the Gramm-Rudman law requires use
of the administration forecast, Democrats are helpless to do more
than complain.
   Using these optimistic projections, the White House is expected
to say that it needs $30 billion to $35 billion in savings to reach
the Gramm-Rudman deficit target of $64 billion. The non-partisan
Congressional Budget Office is expected to say that the needed
savings will be more than twice as high.
   Bush is expected to propose minor initiatives in certain
education, environment, anti-drug, child care and science programs.
Democrats are ready to claim that his proposals fall short of what
is needed.

   Panamanians have gone on a spree of
witch hunts in the political shake-up following the U.S. invasion,
sometimes using American troops to settle personal vendettas, U.S.
Army and Panamanian sources say.
   The persistent accusations, dismissals of public employees and
charges made in the news media are hindering the organization of
President Guillermo Endara's new government, frustrating American
officials and delaying the removal of U.S. forces, according to the
sources.
   ``Everyone has turned into a squealer,'' said Army Col. Charles
Morris, director of a 200-member special group called in to help
the new government organize itself.
   ``They have gone wild,'' said another U.S. Army source on
condition of anonymity. ``They are using the U.S. Army for their
own personal revenge. We get calls from someone saying there are
weapons in some house, and we have to check it.''
   Shortly after the Dec. 20 invasion toppled Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, the U.S. Army began acting as a police force for the new
government.
   American forces have arrested not only former members of
Noriega's high command, but leftists and leaders of old political
parties, including the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party that
backed the old government.
   As of Friday, the U.S. Army still held 100 military and civilian
prisoners at Fort Clayton at ``the request of the Panamanian
government,'' which was sorting out possible charges against some
of them.
   Newspapers have become a daily register of purported wrongdoings
by government officials, business leaders and politicians who once
had some tie to Noriega.
   U.S. soldiers, often following tips from neighbors or
ideological foes, arrested many members of leftist political
parties and held them for two or three days. In some cases, their
main sin was militancy in the Communist Party.
   ``The soldiers would come in and arrest someone, or they would
go into an office and take what they wanted,'' said Mario Rognoni,
who spent three days in custody because he served in government
under Noriega. ``Then they would encourage people to loot the place
so they could blame the sacking on them.''
   ``The Army took our computer, our records, and then left it open
so people could take everything else,'' alleged Rognoni, a
Democratic Revolutionary Party leader.
   The retaliation has even extended to the girlfriends and
mistresses of pro-Noriega officials, who have had sofas, cars and
even dishes seized on the assumption they were bought with stolen
money.
   Leaders of the new political opposition claim more than 8,000
public employees have been fired after they were accused of having
been loyal to the past regime.
   ``But many of the public employees were forced by the (Noriega)
government to participate in pro-government demonstrations or join
the paramilitary groups. It was either that or lose their jobs,''
said a former member of a paramilitary organization. ``What were
you supposed to do when you have a family to feed?''
   The Endara government has seized at least 10 radio stations and
two television stations owned by people suspected of association
with Noriega.
   More than 100 official accusations or private lawsuits filed
against former government officials have piled up at the attorney
general's office. All must be investigated, said Attorney General
Rogelio Cruz.
   Meanwhile, the two competing newspapers, La Estrella and El
Siglo, have been trying to outdo each other showing how close to
Noriega the other's director was.
   ``There is hatred; there is desire for revenge. The country has
gone mad,'' said Rognoni.
   ``The worst part,'' said a politician who spoke on condition of
anonymity, ``is that the new `ins' who now own this country did not
fight for it.
   ``The gringos gave it to them on a silver platter. They did not
shed a single drop of blood for it.''

<HEAD>Controversy over Northern Ireland Inquiry Flares Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Stalker, the cop whose thwarted investigation
came to symbolize doubts about justice in Northern Ireland, is back
to haunt the British government.
   Stalker, who was removed in 1986 before completing an inquiry
into killings by police in Northern Ireland, says he has
documentary proof his ouster was engineered by ``senior civil
servants, possibly at the Cabinet level'' in Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government.
   If Stalker is to be believed _ and the government strongly
denies it _ his removal was intended to obstruct an investigation
of alleged murder and perjury by officers of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force.
   Trevor Forbes, recently retired as chief of the RUC's
anti-terrorist Special Branch, was quoted by The Sunday Times as
saying ``there was no conspiracy and no cover-up within the RUC.''
   If there had been, he argued, Stalker's deputy also would have
been removed, but he was not.
   Stalker's new claim of proof came last week after fraud charges
against his friend, Kevin Taylor, were dismissed in Manchester
Crown Court.
   It was Stalker's alleged association with ``known criminals''
that led to his suspension from the investigation. His association
with Taylor was at the core of the inquiry.
   ``I have always said that the charges against Mr. Taylor were a
contrivance, a means of getting at me through him,'' Stalker said.
   Taylor's attorneys said detectives lied to obtain a warrant to
examine Taylor's bank records. Documents relating to the warrant
are now missing, prosecutors acknowledge.
   Taylor intends to sue for malicious prosecution, his attorneys
said.
   Britain's Director of Public Prosecutions, Allen Green, asked
Greater Manchester Police to investigate their handling of the case
that was so damaging to Stalker, who was then Manchester's
second-highest officer.
   ``No one involved in the Greater Manchester Police should be
involved in the inquiry except as witnesses,'' protested Cecil
Franks, a lawmaker from Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party and
longtime supporter of Stalker.
   Home Secretary David Waddington, the Cabinet official
responsible for law enforcement, resisted calls for a judicial
inquiry.
   ``People are too prone these days to come up with conspiracy
theories without looking at what, in fact, happened,'' Waddington
said. ``If Mr. Stalker has a document which he feels is relevant, I
am sure he will produce it.''
   Stalker said he would do that but only to ``someone with direct
access to and authority from the Cabinet.''
   The Stalker story goes back to Oct. 27, 1982, when Irish
Republican Army guerrillas killed three RUC officers in an ambush
with a land mine.
   On Nov. 11, 1982, three suspects identified by an informer were
shot to death by Special Branch officers. On Nov. 24, the same unit
killed one man and wounded another near a hay barn, where police
believed the mine that killed their colleagues had been stored.
   On Dec. 12, two more suspects were killed by the same Special
Branch unit.
   The IRA admitted that the first three men killed were its
``volunteers,'' and the Irish National Liberation Army, an IRA
splinter, claimed the last two.
   No terrorist connection, however, was made to Michael Tighe, 17,
who was killed at the hay shed.
   Facing a storm of accusations that the RUC had a
``shoot-to-kill'' policy, Chief Constable Sir John Hermon appointed
Stalker in March 1984 to conduct an independent investigation.
   Stalker has said he admired the courage of many RUC officers and
sympathized with their difficulties in battling terrorism, but he
was appalled by the slapdash quality of the RUC's own
investigations of the killings.
   His most piquant discovery was that police and army intelligence
had been bugging the hay shed when Tighe was killed.
   Stalker pressed Hermon for access to the tape and for more
information about the use of informers.
   ``I was within a couple of days of obtaining the vital tape''
and of being allowed to question Hermon, when he was told that he
was himself under investigation for alleged involvement with
criminals, Stalker wrote in his book on the affair. Stalker was
formally suspended in June 1986.
   He was reinstated as deputy chief constable within 10 weeks but
the investigation was completed by another officer who recommended
prosecution of some RUC officers.
   Attorney General Sir Patrick Mayhew ultimately decided against
prosecution, citing national security.
   Last year, 18 RUC officers were disciplined for minor offenses
related to the case. Hermon has retired.

<HEAD>21 Reported Killed in Kashmir Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARUN JOSHI</BYLINE>

   Troops battled mobs of Moslem separatists in
the Kashmir city of Srinagar over the weekend, and at least 21
people were killed and 100 wounded before the fighting subsided
Sunday night, police said.
   Fifteen demonstrators were shot and killed Sunday, while six
were fatally wounded late Saturday night, according to Mohammad
Nomani, inspector general of Srinagar police. Militants defied a
curfew and continued trading intermittent shots with government
forces on Sunday, officials said.
   Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the death
toll was at least 30, but that figure could not be confirmed.
   Nomani, speaking by telephone from Srinagar, the summer capital
of Jammu-Kashmir state, said the fighting tapered off late Sunday
afternoon as heavy rains lashed the city. But gunfire echoed
through the deserted streets until evening, one resident said,
requesting anonymity.
   ``They (the troops) are shooting at anything moving,'' he said.
   ``It is a disastrous situation out there,'' said Ramesh Kaul, a
hotel receptionist in Srinagar.
   At least 47 people have been killed in Jammu-Kashmir state since
the beginning of the year in violence triggered by Moslem militants
demanding independence or union with Islamic Pakistan.
   The separatists, led by the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, have
often attacked government offices and police officials.
   ``The situation is tense and dangerous,'' the state's chief
secretary, Moosa Raza, said in Jammu, the state's winter capital 95
miles south of Srinagar.
   Nomani said the police dispatched 25 cars with loudspeakers into
the city, to appeal to people to obey the curfew. The cars were
escorted by heavily armed troops from the paramilitary Central
Reserve Police Force, he said.
   A 24-hour curfew was imposed Saturday in a bid to quell
escalating violence and mass anti-India demonstrations in Srinagar
and nearby towns.
   But late Saturday, crowds defied curfew and surged into downtown
Srinagar chanting ``Indian dogs go back!'' and ``Long live
Pakistan!'' local reporters said.
   They said the paramilitary troops opened fire, killing two
people instantly and injuring 14. Four of them died later. As news
of the shootings spread, thousands of Moslem men poured out of
their homes, the reporters said.
   They said protesters recited verses from the Koran, the Moslem
holy book. Some took up a chant urging ``mujahedeen,'' or Islamic
holy warriors, to prepare for the final sacrifice in a showdown
with India's Hindu-dominated government.
   Jammu-Kashmir's former state chief minister, Farooq Abdullah,
issued a statement accusing authorities of letting loose a ``reign
of terror and repression.''
   Abdullah's Moslem-dominated National Conference Party is closely
aligned with the Congress Party of Rajiv Gandhi, the arch political
foe of Prime Minister V.P. Singh.
   Abdullah's government resigned Friday to protest the appointment
of Singh's nominee as the state's new governor and imposition of
governor's rule which amounts to tighter federal control over the
state.
   The curfew order was one of the first acts of the new governor,
Jagmohan, a tough administrator who had cracked down on Kashmiri
militants during an earlier stint as the state's governor.
Jagmohan, a Hindu who uses one name, took office Friday.
   Parts of Kashmir region are claimed by both India and Pakistan.
The dispute started when the state was partitioned between the two
countries when they gained independence from Britain in 1947.
   Srinagar's 800,000 people are moslty Moslem, as is a majority of
population in the Kashmir region. The Jammu region is predominantly
Hindu.
   India has often accused Pakistan of aiding the Kashmiri
militants, a charge Pakistan has denied.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only state with a Moslem majority in
predominantly Hindu India. Moslems make up 64 percent of the state
population of 5 million.
   Nationwide, Moslems comprise 12 percent of India's 880 million
people, while Hindus comprise 82 percent.

   King Hussein met Sunday with the U.S. Army
chief of staff, Gen. Carl E. Vuono, who also held talks with senior
Jordanian military officials.
   Neither Jordanian nor U.S. officials released substantive
descriptions of the talks.
   Jordan's official Petra news agency said Vuono and his Jordanian
counterpart, Gen. Fathi Abu Taleb, ``reviewed the military
situation in the region in general and ways of cooperation and
other issues of mutual interest.''
   Abu Taleb and Field Marshal Zeid Bin Shaker, Hussein's royal
court chief, attended the palace meeting.
   The United States was long Jordan's primary military supplier,
but U.S. refusal to carry through on a proposed fighter plane sale
in the early 1980s due to pro-Israeli moves in Congress damaged
relations. Jordan then looked to Europe and the Soviet Union for
help.
   The United States still supplies spare parts and trains
Jordanian soldiers. It also takes part in yearly military exercises
in the kingdom.

<TEXT>
   The 46-nation Organization of
Islamic Conference on Sunday condemned a Tunisian professor for
writing a comic book version of the Koran, the Moslem holy book.
   Hamid al-Gabid, secretary-general of the organization, described
the French-language work by Youssef Seddik as ``sacrilegious'' and
``heresy.''
   Seddik's ``Si Le Coran M'Etait Conte,'' or ``If The Koran Were
Told To Me,'' was published in late December in Paris, where the
author has lived since 1983. The book uses cartoons to illustrate
verses from the Koran.
   Seddik told The Associated Press in Paris earlier this month
that his aim was simply to make the Koran more accessible to young
people. He denied he violated the tenets of Islam.
   His wife, Saida, said in Paris on Sunday that her husband was
out of town and unaware of the latest criticism of the book, sold
by Alef for $10. Earlier this month, a professor of Islamic studies
in Kuwait also condemned the book.
   Mrs. Seddik said her husband is ``completely flabbergasted'' by
the reaction. ``The book is written by someone who believes in
Islam and who did not seek in any way to commit heresy,'' she said.
``I don't understand why the Islamic leaders have focused with such
bitterness on the comic books.''
   The statement by the Organization of Islamic Conference said,
``The OIC strongly reproves and condemns this series of
publications as well as the publicity accorded to it.''
   The group, headquartered in Jiddah, urged all member states and
Islamic organizations and associations to remain vigilant against
such ``pernicious acts,'' which it charged were aimed at
undermining the Islamic faith.
   ``By indulging in a sacrilegious act which breaches the
authenticity of the Holy Koran, the author of these series of
cartoons has committed an act of true heresy harmful to Islam and
Moslems because it violates the sanctity of the Holy Book and the
inviolability of what was revealed in it.''
   Last year, the group condemned Salman Rushdie, the Indian-born
British author, for writing the novel, ``The Satanic Verses,''
which the organization and many Moslems around the world considered
blasphemous.
   Rushdie went into hiding after Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini called for Rushdie's assassination, and Iranian clerics
offered a multimillion dollar reward for anyone who carried out the
order.
   Tunisia's highest religious body, the Higher Islamic Council,
condemned Seddik's book Jan. 16 and said it contained ``profane
images that constitute ... heresy.'' It said the book should be
banned.
   Mohammed Faidallah, head of Islamic Jurisprudence at Kuwait
University, said earlier this month that Seddik's book constituted
a ``criminal act that ridicules the sanctity of the Holy Koran.''
   He branded Seddik ``a new Salman Rushdie.''
   The Organization of Islamic Conference promotes Islamic
solidarity and cooperation in the Moslem world. Its members include
Indonesia, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh and Malaysia.

   Tens of thousands of East
Germans carrying suitcases marched across the border into West
Germany on Sunday in a symbolic exodus to protest the Communist
Party in their homeland.
   ``They wanted to show how many people are ready to leave the
country in case the Communist Party remains in power after the May
6 elections'' in East Germany, West Germany's ARD television said.
   The marchers crossed the border at Duderstadt near the West
German city of Goettingen. About 60,000 people were involved in the
demonstration, ARD said.
   But police in Goettingen estimated the crowd of marchers at
20,000 to 25,000.
   The protesters carried banners reading: ``The Next Time it Will
Be For Real,'' and ``If the Communist Government Remains, We Will
Give Up Our Homeland.''
   Another banner read, ``Whoever Votes For the Communists, Votes
for Exodus.''
   ARD said the demonstration was organized by East Germany's
Christian Democratic Union party. In West Germany, the protesters
shouted out slogans for a unified Germany.
   After a short demonstration in West Germany, the crowd went back
across the border to East Germany. No incidents were reported,
police said.
   Despite democratic reforms in their country, about 30,000 East
Germans have resettled in West Germany so far this year, joining
the more 340,000 who arrived in 1989. East Germany's Communist
Party is under fire for not making reforms quickly enough.

   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told the Cabinet
on Sunday that the United States plans to supply several hundred
tanks to Egypt, Israel army radio said.
   A well-informed Israeli official confirmed the report and said
Rabin referred to U.S.-made M60A1 tanks. The official declined to
provide any details on delivery date or the number of tanks to be
supplied.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Sean Walsh had no comment
and referred the query to the Pentagon, where the press duty
officer, Lt. Cmdr. Ken Satterfield, also declined to comment.
   The M60 tank entered service in 1960, and its updated version,
the M60A1, was introduced in 1962.
   Rabin's disclosure reportedly caused some concern in the Cabinet
despite the fact that Egypt is the only Arab country with which
Israel has a peace treaty. The two countries signed a U.S.-mediated
treaty in 1979.
   It was not immediately clear why Egypt would want the additional
hardware or how it would enhance its arsenal.
   Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies says
Egypt already has 850 tanks from the M60A3 series, an advanced
version of the M60A1.
   The center says Egypt also already has U.S. armored personnel
carriers, anti-tank guided missiles, combat aircraft, early warning
aircraft, radars, target drones and fire control systems for
submarines.

said Sunday.
   The Antioquia state police identified the victims as two
managers of the ranch near the town of Gomez Plata and 10 youths
who had traveled there on vacation from the city of Medellin.
   The victims were found with their hands and feet tied and with
numerous bullet wounds, police said in a communique. They did not

<HEAD>Personnel Chief Says Career Diplomatics Being Appointed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, despite criticism from
Democrats about ambassadorships going to major Republican donors,
has met his goal of putting career diplomats in charge of
two-thirds of the embassies, the White House personnel director
said Sunday.
   For the next three years of Bush's term, ``close to 100
percent'' of ambassadorial appointments will go to career foreign
service officers in order to maintain that balance of two-thirds
career officers, one-third outside appointees, Charles G.
Untermeyer said.
   ``Henceforth, for the rest of the first Bush term, I expect
very, very few non-career nominations,'' the director of
presidential personnel said in an interview.
   By Untermeyer's count, 97 of the 145 ambassadorships have gone
to career diplomats, or 67 percent. Ninety-three are already in
place, one is awaiting Senate confirmation and three are still
getting cleared before they are formally nominated.
   Forty-eight ambassadorships have gone or will go to non-career
people: 42 have already been confirmed, two are awaiting Senate
confirmation and four are in the White House clearance process.
   Of those 48, Untermeyer said ``10 or less were what you could
call major donors,'' including several who made the GOP's ``Team
100'' by giving $100,000 or more to the party for the 1988 election
battle. They included real estate developers Melvin Sembler, now
ambassador to Australia, and Joseph Zappala, now envoy to Spain.
   ``Many of the non-career people are there for past proven
loyalty to George Bush,'' said Untermeyer, but he said their ranks
include such ``relatively poor people'' as Evelyn Teegan, a former
Republican National Committeewoman from Minnesota who is now
ambassador to Fiji, and Sally Novetzke, a party activist and
longtime Bush loyalist from Iowa who is now ambassador to Malta.
   Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes, D-Md., objected to several of Bush's
politically connected nominees last year and managed to block Joy
Silverman's nomination to be ambassador to Barbados. She gave
$180,000 to Republican causes befor the last election.
   Untermeyer said the White House has not yet decided whether to
resubmit her nomination.
   The percentage of non-career envoys is down from roughly 40
percent at the end of the Reagan administration to the current 33
percent, said Untermeyer.
   That was the goal that Bush and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III laid out at the start of the administration, and it was
achieved when Bush decided to nominate a career diplomat, Edward
Rowell, to be ambassador to Luxembourg, long a post reserved for
presidential pals.
   Originally, Bush had nominated his chief campaign fund-raiser,
Frederick Bush _ no relation _ to the Luxembourg post, but the
Senate batted that nomination back in August after Frederick Bush
came under scrutiny for contracts he received from the Reagan
administration's scandal-ridden Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   Theodore S. Wilkinson, president of the Foreign Service
Association, which represents foreign service officers, said, ``If
they hold to their pledge to keep a two-to-one ratio, they're going
to have to'' name career diplomats to the ambassadorships that open
up for the next three years.
   ``They've filled about a third of them with party loyalists.
They don't have any left,'' said Wilkinson. The non-career
appointments have been ``very uneven. There's some very good ones
and some very inexperienced ones.''
   By law, Wilkinson said, even the non-career appointees are
supposed to be knowledgable about the history, economics, politics
and language of the country they are assigned to. ``Some don't seem
to meet those criteria,'' said Wilkinson.
   With Congress returning from a two-month recess, Untermeyer said
the White House will send up 30 nominations on Tuesday.
   Some Democrats accused Bush last year of running ``a
Swiss-cheese government'' and taking too long to fill vacancies.
   But Untermeyer said only 5 percent of the 659 top jobs in
Cabinet departments and independent agencies were vacant. All but
25 of these 659 jobs also require Senate confirmation.

<HEAD>Vermont's Political Super Bowl: 1990 Governor Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER GRAFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vermont's gubernatorial election is
months away, but analysts are already excited about the possibility
of a three-way race involving three nationally recognized
politicians.
   Bernard Sanders, Burlington's former socialist mayor, and former
Republican Gov. Richard Snelling are both leaning toward 1990
gubernatorial bids. The Democratic incumbent, Madeleine Kunin, is
expected to seek re-election.
   ``It would be the Super Bowl of Vermont politics,'' said John
Franco, the Burlington city attorney and a close associate of
Sanders.
   ``It would be the wildest gubernatorial race,'' said Sen.
Douglas Racine, the Senate president pro tem.
   Snelling is expected to announce his intentions this week;
Sanders is planning to reveal his plans within two weeks. Kunin is
not expected to make any announcement until after the current
legislative session ends sometime this spring.
   All three politicians have achieved national prominence over the
past decade. Kunin, the state's first woman governor, has taken
strong stands on the environment and abortion rights; Sanders is
well known for his eight years as the socialist mayor of Vermont's
largest city; and Snelling, a Republican, is a former chairman of
the National Governors' Association.
   In Vermont, a candidate for governor must win a majority; if no
candidate does, the election is decided not by a runoff but in the
Legislature. This is precisely what happened in 1986, when Sanders
last made a try for governor. Kunin received 47 percent of the
votes, the Republican, Peter Smith, got 38 percnet and Sanders got
14 percent. The Democrat-controlled legislature gave the nod to
Kunin.
   At present, Democrats maintain a narrow edge in the legislature.
   Kunin, now in her third two-year term, has seen her support slip
in recent months as the state's economy has slowed, prompting her
to call for budget cuts and tax increases. Some also oppose her
calls for such measures as a ban on disposable diapers.
   Snelling, who served as governor from 1977 to 1985, has been
urged to run by Republicans who feel he is the GOP's best chance of
winning back the office. The former governor said he will run ``if
I find that I can contribute to solving the problems that are out
there.''
   Sanders, who stepped down as mayor last year, considers himself
a socialist but runs as an independent. He gained new credibility
when he ran a strong second, ahead of the Democratic candidate,
former House Majority Leader Paul Poirier, in the 1988 race for the
U.S. House.
   Poirier said Sanders shouldn't be underestimated, adding,
``Bernie made a believer out of me.''
   Franco said, ``You can safely say Bernard Sanders will be a
statewide candidate in 1990,'' but added, ``I can tell you he has
not made up his mind'' about running for Congress or governor.
   Sanders was out of town late last week and could not be reached
for comment.
   Kunin supporters say that a challenge from Snelling alone would
not force the governor out of a race. ``Madeleine Kunin doesn't
walk away from fights,'' said her former press spokesman, Robert
Sherman.
   But the entry of both Snelling and Sanders would dramatically
alter the political reality. ``It would be a very tough race for
her,'' Poirier said. ``All three of them would start out as
equals.''
   ``A Snelling-Sanders-Kunin race starts out with the advantage
going to the Republican,'' said Peter Welch, a Democrat and a
former state Senate leader, who said Sanders and Kunin would split
the progressive vote.
   Elizabeth Bankowski, Kunin's former chief of staff, disagreed.
   ``Don't ever underestimate Madeleine Kunin's ability to rise to
the occasion,'' she said.
   Snelling, who might face a Republican primary challenge from
Michael Bernhardt, would be the first former Vermont governor to
try to regain the office since Erastus Fairbanks did so in 1860.
His greatest task would be to persuade voters he has a vision for
the state in the 1990s.
   Bankowski revealed Kunin's slant on a Snelling candidacy: ``I
don't think that's what the governor meant when she called on
Vermonters to do more recycling.''

<TEXT>
   The body of Ferdinand Marcos' mother
was entombed Sunday 20 months after she died, ending a bizarre
vigil by supporters of the late president who had hoped mother and
son would be buried together.
   Marcos supporters used the entombment of Josefa Edralin-Marcos,
who died May 4, 1988 at age 95, to denounce the government of
President Corazon Aquino.
   About 1,000 people, including local officials, gathered as the
body of Mrs. Edralin-Marcos was placed in a glass and wood
structure behind the Marcos family home, where she had been lying
in state.
   ``We don't want a political color to this ceremony,'' said the
Rev. Domingo Nebres, who also officiated at Marcos' entombment in
Hawaii.
   ``We want a loving tribute to Dona Josefa...She is a woman who
did not construct monuments that can be destroyed later but was the
mother of a president who served us for 20 years to protect our
country from communistic hands.''
   Nebres recited a message from Marcos' widow, Imelda, in exile in
the United States, thanking people in this Marcos stronghold for
``accompanying my beloved Momma'' to her resting place.
   Relatives said a refrigerated concrete structure will be built
over the crypt next month to serve as a temporary tomb until Mrs.
Edralin-Marcos can be buried permanently alongside the former
president, who died Sept. 28 in exile in Hawaii.
   After Mrs. Edralin-Marcos died, Marcos' supporters demanded that
Marcos be allowed to return to the country for her funeral.
President Aquino refused, so the body lay in state, repeatedly
embalmed.
   Mrs. Aquino also refused to allow Marcos' body to be returned to
his homeland, citing national security.
   Marcos' body has been entombed in Hawaii, but his family has
vowed to bring it back for burial one day in his hometown of Batac,
240 miles north of Manila.
   During the Roman Catholic Mass before the entombment, Rodolfo
Farinas, governor of Ilocos Norte province, said there will be no
political peace in the Marcos strongholds until the former
president is buried in the Philippines.
   ``They (government) are afraid of the fierce loyalties of the
Ilocanos,'' Farinas said. ``Let us stand up. We will show them that
we are loyal within the bounds of the law. Let us all join hands,
let us give them an assurance, show them that nothing will go wrong
if the body (of Marcos) is returned here and show them that we can
be trusted.''
   Former National Assembly Speaker Nicanor Yniguez, fighting back
tears, said the government's refusal to allow mother and son to be
buried together was a sign of ``vindictiveness and vengeance.''
   Several in the crowd wept during the ceremony. Others wore
Marcos campaign T-shirts from the 1986 election that resulted in
Mrs. Aquino's rise to power.
   After the vote, a military-civilian uprising forced Marcos to
flee the country.
   Marcos' brother Pacifico attended the Sunday ceremony. A sister,
Elizabeth Keon, died in 1986, and another sister, Fortuna, is in
Hawaii.
   Marcos' father, Mariano, disappeared during World War II.
   Marcos was accused of stealing up to $10 million from the
Philippines during his 20-year rule, although the government of
Mrs. Aquino has not filed charges against him.
   A lawyer representing the Marcos family said Sunday in
Switzerland that he has appealed a decision by a Zurich attorney to
unblock $260 million deposited in Swiss banks by Marcos.
   After an investigation lasting more than three years, the Zurich
district attorney, Peter Cosandey, agreed in principle Jan. 4 to
unfreeze Marcos assets in banks owned by the Swiss Credit Institute
and release certain bank documents. But he said this was subject to
the completion of criminal proceedings in the Philippines to prove
the funds were illegally obtained.
   Marcos lawyers have filed appeals at every level of
Switzerland's complex judicial system, frustrating Manila's
attempts to obtain legal assistance to recover the wealth.
   Although the Swiss froze assets held by Marcos and his
associates shortly after he was deposed, only $2.13 million has
been handed over to the Philippines.

   City Council Chairman David Clarke would
become acting mayor if Marion Barry should he resign in the wake of
a federal drug charge.
   The next step would be to hold a special election on the first
Tuesday that occurs once 114 days have elapsed since the formal
resignation.
   However, the regularly scheduled general election, scheduled for
Nov. 6, would be held instead of a special election if the
resignation occurred less than 114 days before election day.
   City Administrator Carol B. Thompson, Barry's top aide, is
fulfilling the duties of the mayor's office. Thompson, who can
serve in that post indefinitely, has all the powers of mayor except
the ability to veto legislation or approve spending projects that
exceed $1 million in cost.
   If Thompson were to leave the government before Barry had
resigned or was ready to return to office, the mayor could appoint
any executive branch employee to handle the duties of his office.

   The government Sunday pledged to
adopt democratic reforms regardless of whether they are supported
by the Communist Party, which was deadlocked in a key congress
between liberals and hard-liners.
   Communists from the liberal republic of Slovenia urged that the
party transform itself into a loose coalition of regional Communist
parties in this nation of six federated republics and two provinces.
   Such a move would radically transform it from its traditional
centralized federal party structure and would significantly reduce
the power of the national Communist Party.
   But opponents warn that party unity is vital to the unity of
Yugoslavia, which is undergoing its worst economic crisis and is
beset by ethnic rivalries.
   Slovenian Party leader Ciril Ribicic also urged the congress to
immediately adopt a key document declaring the party's willingness
to relinquish its monopoly on power and support free elections.
   Slovenian delegates are fighting over the issue of political and
party reform with their hard-line rivals in the largest state,
Serbia.
   Regional party autonomy has been rejected by the Serbians, who
favor a strong centralized party structure and want slower
political change.
   Vice Premier Zivko Pregl warned that the government would not
allow the fate of the country to ``be decided in quarrels among
people representing 10 percent of the population,'' referring to
the 2 million party members.
   Pregl said the proceedings at the party congress would ``not in
any way influence the government.''
   On Friday, the government said it would present constitutional
amendments to Parliament scrapping the party's guaranteed leading
role in society, and lay the legal groundwork for free elections
due in April.
   Pregl said the government would go ahead with these plans
regardless of whether the party adopts the key draft document
declaring its willingness to relinquish its 45-year monopoly on
power.
   The party would in future only ``be relevant to the extent they
succeed in elections,'' he said.
   Discussion of the political reform document was forced into the
background as delegates engaged in a bitter war of words over the
future of the party, a debate indicative of the deep split within
the party.
   Slovenian leader Ribicic said the Yugoslav Communist Party
should ``become an organization of independent and free republican
Communist'' parties.
   Only then ``can we compete in a multiparty system on an equal
footing with other regional parties in the struggle for power,''
Ribicic said.
   There is a deep split within the party between those backing
rapid political change in conjunction with economic reforms already
under way and those reluctant to fully relinquish the Communists'
hold on power.
   ``No one wants to break up an organization such as this when it
is most necessary because of the upcoming democratic reforms,''
said Sonja Lokar, a Slovenian party leader, in an apparent attempt
to allay conservatives' fears that the Slovenian proposal wiil lead
to dissolution of the party.
   Earlier Sunday, Serbia's populist president, Slobodan Milosevic,
reiterated his support for a strong Communist Party.
   Milosevic charged that those seeking de-centralization of the
Communist Party were calling for ``a war among Yugoslav Communists
and ... a war among Yugoslav nations.''
   ``We don't have a united Communist Party, it is only a farce,''
said Slovenian delgate Milos Ciric. ``We don't want to impose our
liberal model on Serbia, and we will not allow Serbia to impose its
model on us either.''

   A study by university deans released Sunday
predicts an intense tug-of-war among government, industry and
academia for people with doctorate degrees.
   As a result, the Association of American Universities said the
nation's ``competitive stature'' can only weaken` in comparison
with other industrialized countries.
   ``This nation faces a serious shortage of PhDs,'' said the
report. ``A sharply increased demand will outstrip Ph.D production
before the turn of the century. Industry, government, and
universities will be pitted against each other in a battle for
critical human capital.''
   The report, ``The PhD. Shortage: The Federal Role,'' was
prepared by a nine-member working group of primarily graduate deans
from AAU institutions. It said the nation will suffer an annual
shortage of 7,500 natural science and engineering doctorates just a
few years into the next century. Shortages of doctorate degrees in
the humanities and social sciences will occur even sooner, said the
report.
   Faculty shortages already have appeared in engineering,
business, and other high-demand fields, the report said.
   In 1985, an estimated 43 percent of all doctorates employed in
the United States were working outside of higher education. Seventy
percent of 1987 engineering doctorates had commitments in
nonacademic sectors _ 53 percent in industry and 17 percent in
government and other nonacademic sectors. About 65 percent of 1987
doctorate recipients in the physical sciences had employment
commitments in nonacademic sectors _ 50 percent in industry, 15
percent in other nonacademic sectors.
   Across all fields, 50 percent of 1987 doctorate recipients had
employment outside academia, said the report.
   The report follows a study in September 1989 by the Mellon
Foundation that estimated there will be only eight applicants for
every 10 liberal arts faculty jobs by the year 2000.
   It also comes on the heel of a call to higher education
institutions last Friday by Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos to
increase by 25 percent the number of U.S. college graduates
completing doctoral programs in the basic arts, mathematics,
sciences, engineering, and technological disciplines.
   ``The current shortages have been somewhat masked by the heavy
enrollment of foreign students in Ph.D. programs in science and
engineering and by the desire of those students to spend at least
some postdoctoral years in employment in this country,'' said AAU
President Robert Rosenzweig.
   ``We should be grateful for that fact, but as many observers
have noted, it is a foolishly risky assumption for the future.''
   Rosenzweig said ``the government has an essential role in
assuring that the nation's intellectual life and economic vitality
remain healthily fed by successvie generations of talent trained to
the highest levels of which our universities are capable.''
   The report recommended ``a significant expansion of federal
support'' for graduate education and a doubling of federal
fellowships and traineeships.
   The AAU is an organization of 56 major U.S. research
universities.

<TEXT>
   An Israeli army colonel was killed Sunday
in a gunbattle with guerrillas who staged an attack in Israel's
self-designated ``security zone'' in south Lebanon, security
sources reported.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
attackers seized a house at 4 p.m. in the village of Yaroun, about
one mile north of the Israeli border.
   Israeli troops surrounded the building and the colonel was
fatally wounded in a shootout, the sources reported.
   They said the identity of the raiders could not be determined
and there were no further details about the clash. It was not known
whose house the guerrillas seized.
   The guerrillas struck two days after Israeli warplanes rocketed
a Palestinian radio station in the Mieh Mieh refugee camp in Sidon
and bases of the Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem Hezbollah, or Party
of God, in the highlands east of the city.
   Seven people were killed and 18 wounded in the raids, the first
Israeli air strikes against targets in Lebanon this year. The raids
are usually launched as reprisals for guerrilla attacks.
   Israel carved out the security zone in south Lebanon in 1985,
when it withdrew the bulk of its occupation army three years after
invading Lebanon.
   The enclave is patrolled by an estimated 1,500 Israeli troops
and the South Lebanon Army, a predominantly Christian militia with
an estimated 3,000 fighters trained, funded and equipped by Israel.
   The officer killed Sunday was the highest-ranking Israeli army
officer killed in Lebanon since the end of the Lebanon invasion.
   Last year, two Israeli soldiers and 12 fighters of the South
Lebanon Army were killed in clashes and attacks by Palestinian and
Shiite Moslem guerrillas in south Lebanon, the Israeli military
command says.
   It lists nine guerrilla attempts to infiltrate into Israel from
Lebanon last year, along with 22 clashes between the Lebanese
guerrillas and Israeli army or South Lebanon Army forces. In these
fights, a total of 75 guerrillas have been killed and 12 captured.

<HEAD>Woman Charged With Child Abuse for Drinking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pregnant woman has been charged with
child abuse after prosecutors accused her of excessive drinking,
drawing fire from civil libertarians who call the case
unprecedented prenatal interference.
   The woman's attorney said such cases would encourage abortions,
but the county attorney said prosecutors shouldn't have to wait
until a child is born with defects to act to protect it.
   Diane Pfannenstiel, 29, who is between four and five months
pregnant, was charged earlier this month with felony child abuse
because her blood-alcohol level was above the standard used to
determine drunk drivers, according to Albany County Attorney Cal
Rerucha.
   The woman was under a judge's order to avoid alcohol because a
previous child she had was born with fetal alcohol syndrome,
according to court records.
   ``If people are concerned with right to life, then they don't
encourage abortion by this kind of abusive prosecution,'' the
defendant's attorney Mary Galvan said Friday.
   ``There is no law in the state of Wyoming that makes it illegal
for a pregnant woman to drink ... that makes it illegal for a woman
of childbearing years to drink,'' Galvan said.
   Such prosecutions could only encourage women who have drunk
alcohol to have an abortion to avoid prosecution, Galvan added.
   According to Galvan, police measured Pfannenstiel's
blood-alcohol level only after the woman came to the police
department to report that her husband had abused her. The next day
Rerucha charged her with child abuse, said Galvan.
   The child abuse charge breaks new ground, according to Lynn
Paltrow, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer.
   ``Thus far we have not documented any prosections for engaging
in the use of alcohol during pregnancy,'' said Paltrow.
   ``This case points to the frightening possibility of states
creating prenatal police patrol. This prosecutor is making up a
crime.''
   When asked Sunday if there was any precedent for prenatal
prosecution of alcohol use, Rerucha replied: ``I don't care if it's
precedent-setting, all I care about is protecting one child in
Wyoming.''
   A Florida woman was found guilty in August of delivery of
cocaine through her umbilical cord to two of her children and an
Illinois woman was found guilty of child abuse because of prenatal
drug use, but neither woman was prosecuted until after the children
were born.
   Rerucha had said earlier that there were cases similar to the
one he brought in Ohio and New York, and while he said all cases
differ in the details, most of the cases were brought after the
child was born. He did not elaborate on whether the cases related
to alcohol or drug use.
   The complaint Rerucha filed against Pfannenstiel charges that
during October, November, December and January the woman
``recklessly inflicted injury on an unborn child'' by
``repeatedly'' consuming alcohol ``in an excessive amount which she
knows will cause serious physical injury upon her unborn child.'' A
preliminary hearing is scheduled Feb. 1.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Says Gas Disaster Settlement Will Be Scrapped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BHARAT DESAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BHOPAL, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh said Sunday his
government will scrap the $470 million settlement reached with
Union Carbide over the Bhopal gas leak and will pursue criminal
charges and the $3 billion originally sought.
   ``We believe there can be no deal over human corpses,'' Singh
told survivors of the 1984 disaster, which killed more than 3,500
people.
   The settlement was accepted last year by the Indian Supreme
Court and by Singh's predecessor, Rajiv Gandhi.
   Singh was greeted by surging crowds when he arrived at the
Jaiprakash Nagar shantytown where many of the victims of the gas
leak lived.
   Some people draped garlands of flowers around Singh's neck or
knelt to touch his feet as he walked through the narrow lanes of
huts just across the street from the now-closed Union Carbide plant.
   At a public rally attended by an estimated 100,000 people,
one-tenth of Bhopal's population, Singh declared: ``We have decided
to do away with the settlement and pursue the $3 billion suit
against the company and also the criminal suit against UCC (Union
Carbide Corp.) officials.''
   He promised that his government would provide interim relief to
all people living in gas-affected areas. The amount of money to be
paid will be determined within one month, he said.
   ``We must look at the Bhopal gas tragedy as a national disaster
and involve all organizations to provide succor to the survivors,''
said Singh, who took office Dec. 2.
   The prime minister did not spell out how his government would
revive the legal case in the world's deadliest industrial disaster.
   The Supreme Court, the highest in the nation, on Feb. 15
accepted a $470 million deal as ``full and final settlement'' of
the government's suit, which had been dragging through a maze of
Indian court procedures for about four years.
   The Gandhi government originally sought $3 billion in damages
and later filed criminal negligence charges against top officials
of the Connecticut-based Union Carbide Corp. and its local
subsidiary, Union Carbide of India Ltd.
   When Union Carbide and the Gandhi government agreed on the $470
million, the Indian Supreme Court absolved the company of further
civil or criminal liability.
   However, under Indian law, the decision is subject to review if
challenged. Gas victims and activist groups filed petitions with
the court challenging the settlement on two grounds: that the
Gandhi government had no right to declare itself the sole
representative of all claims arising from the Bhopal gas disaster;
and that the compensation of $470 million was inadequate.
   The Supreme Court declared Dec. 22 that the Gandhi government
did, indeed, have the right to be the claimants' only
representative.
   The second challenge is still pending, and the Singh government
announced Jan. 12 it would support the challengers.
   Union Carbide has maintained the gas leak was the result of
sabotage by a disgruntled employee at the Bhopal plant. The
government maintained the disaster was caused by company negligence.
   Methyl isocyanate, a liquid used in making pesticides, leaked
from a tank and turned into a deadly vapor when it hit the air Dec.
3, 1984, when most people were asleep.
   Many people died in their sleep or as they tried to flee in the
choking white cloud.
   According to figures compiled by the government of Madhya
Pradesh state, which includes Bhopal, the death toll has reached
3,598. About half the victims died immediately or within a few days
of exposure to the gas. The others died later of respiratory and
other problems caused by the gas, according to government records.
   An additional 20,000 people are still classified as injured.

<HEAD>Magazine Says Major Accident At Nuclear Plant Narrowly Averted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany averted a major
nuclear power accident in 1976 that could have been as devasting as
the one at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union, a West German magazine
said Sunday.
   East German officials have not disclosed the potential
seriousness of the incident, Der Spiegel said.
   The Hamburg-based magazine said the incident took place in 1976
at the Soviet-designed nuclear power plant called Lubmin, near the
town of Greifswald in northern East Germany.
   Quoting a former engineer from the plant, Spiegel said careless
manipulation of an electrical grounding system by one of the
plant's electricians resulted in a major fire that destroyed most
of the cable network.
   The fire disabled six cooling pumps for the Block I reactor at
the plant, and five of six backup pumps were also inactivated,
Spiegel said.
   ``It was only through luck'' that one of the backup pumps
functioned, Spiegel said, explaining that the backup pump had been
accidentally hooked up to the electrical system of Block II, which
was functioning.
   If the one backup pump had not functioned, a meltdown as
devastating as the 1986 Chernobyl accident could have occurred and
would have spread radioactive fallout over much of northern
Germany, Sweden and Denmark, the magazine said.
   Spiegel, quoting the engineer, said that the East German army
was called in to clean up the plant, which was repaired and put
back into operation four months later. It did not identify the
engineer.
   The report, which is to appear in the weekly magazine's Monday
edition, was provided in advance to other news media.
   The April 26, 1986, explosion at the No. 4 reactor of the
four-unit Chernobyl nuclear power plant was the world's worst
atomic accident. Two workers died immediately of burns they
suffered in the explosion, 28 died shortly after the accident from
radiation exposure, and one died of a heart attack while fighting
the fire.
   The accident sent a cloud of radiation over large parts of
northern and central Europe, leading to bans on foodstuffs from
several countries.

<TEXT>
   In Iowa, where they covet convertibles, loathe
telephone answering machines, keep an eye out for extraterrestrials
and pine for more affectionate goldfish, the poll people are at it
again.
   ``If you could take one thing with you after you die, what would
it be?'' asks the Iowa Poll, an often-irreverent institution that
has been probing public opinion in its home state for 46 years.
   The answers, published Sunday in The Des Moines Register: loved
ones (19 percent); pictures (6 percent); pets and jewelry (3
percent each). And so on.
   Extraordinary elsewhere, such tidbits are common fare in this
tireless chronicler of the offbeat in Iowa society. ``We like to be
a trendsetter in the area of goofiness,'' said the poll's director,
J. Ann Selzer.
   Others are catching on. Just this month, WCBS-TV in New York
aired a special called ``The Great American TV Poll.'' Among its
findings: Twenty-one percent of Americans think suspenders on men
are sexy.
   That's just the latest. In September the Los Angeles Times
revealed that 8 percent of the drivers in Southern California have
fuzzy dice, or some such ornament, strung from their rearview
mirrors. And CBS News reported last year that 7 percent of
Americans believe Elvis Presley may still be alive.
   A spokeswoman at Graceland, the King's Memphis
mansion-turned-museum, maintained that he died on Aug. 16, 1977.
   No matter. In this information-soaked age, goofy polls are the
latest rage. And some of the nation's pollsters, bone-weary from
their labors in the fields of political prognostication, love it.
   ``I could defend the Elvis question till the cows come home,''
said CBS pollster Kathleen A. Frankovic. First, she said, there's
currency: ``People talk all the time about sightings of Elvis.''
Second, there's sociological illumination: ``Knowing that 7 percent
of the American people think Elvis is alive says something about
this country.''
   What it says, Frankovic would not venture.
   Selzer, similarly, declined to draw conclusions about the 5
percent of Iowans who say they were personally affected by the
death of British punk rocker Sid Vicious. But she called that ``a
wonderful finding.''
   ``From the very inception of this poll part of its mission has
been to explore the soft underbelly of the Iowa psyche,'' she said
in a recent interview. ``We are fascinated with the whole idea of
what being an Iowan means. The poll gives us a wonderful instrument
for tapping into that.''
   Iowans expect nothing less of their poll. It was Selzer who
revealed how many of them have pink flamingos, or other ornaments,
on their lawns (24 percent). It was she who found that 65 percent
of Iowans prayed for rain last summer, 56 percent prefer paper
grocery bags to plastic ones, 42 percent wish they owned a
convertible, 26 percent sunbathe, 9 percent know what Auld Lang
Syne means (``old long since,'' literally, the good old days,
figuratively.)
   There is much more: Forty-three percent of Iowans believe there
is life on other planets. Forty-two percent are annoyed by
telephone answering machines. Eighty-seven percent say it's not the
heat, it's the humidity.
   And among those who keep tropical fish, 40 percent wish their
pets were more affectionate. ``That one had a very small sample
size, I have to point out,'' Selzer said. ``We couldn't resist,
however.''
   The Los Angeles Times couldn't resist Selzer's finding that 11
percent of Iowan drivers have names for their cars. ``I stole that
question,'' said L.A. Times pollster I.A. ``Bud'' Lewis. ``Because
I liked it.''
   Pilfering queries is an honorable polling tradition that allows
for comparison of data. Lewis' result: Eleven percent of Southern
California's drivers have names for their cars, too. In both
states, moreover, ``Betsy'' is among the favorite automotive
monikers.
   Not to make Betsy blush, but Lewis also found that 38 percent of
Southern California drivers admit having made indecent gestures
toward other drivers who'd made them angry.
   More gestures may be on the way. Four percent in the L.A. Times
poll had telephones in their cars and 31 percent said they'd like
one. But in the national ``Great American TV Poll,'' 54 percent
said it should be illegal to use a car phone while driving.
   Other polls drive for the bizarre. The satirical Spy magazine
reported this month that 5 percent of the Americans it had polled
said they would sacrifice a finger for a big part in a movie.
   Some of them, at least, may find it hard to make obscene
gestures.
   For the more sober polls, there is a serious side to offbeat
questions. ``They illuminate an aspect of the way Americans are
thinking in a way that normal, straightforward questions don't
illuminate,'' said CBS' Frankovic. ``These are the areas where the
answers are not predictable.''
   The result is ``something fun, something interesting, something
that you can't find out any other way,'' said Selzer. ``A poll
gives you an opportunity to take that snapshot of a little slice of
life. And people love to read about themselves.''

<HEAD>Japan Lauching Bid to Become Third Lunar Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a launch scheduled Tuesday, Japan hopes to join
an elite club in space technology by becoming the third nation to
send a spacecraft to the moon.
   If successful, the Muses-A will be the first spacecraft to visit
the moon since the Soviet Union landed the unmanned vehicle Luna 24
on its surface in 1976. The United States is the only other nation
that has sent spacecraft to Earth's closest neighbor.
   Japan has advanced rapidly in aerospace in recent years.
Although it was noted for its aviation technology during World War
II, the industry was banned by U.S. occupation forces. As a result,
Japan entered the aerospace field late.
   Officials of the Institute of Space and Astronautial Science, or
ISAS, said the launch will develop technology needed for
exploration of other planets, including precise control of orbits
and high-efficiency data transmission from distant satellites to
Earth.
   The three-stage solid-fuel rocket, an M3S-2 made by Nissan Motor
Co. standing 92 feet tall, will be carrying two satellites _ a
larger mother satellite that is to orbit the Earth and a smaller
moon orbiter.
   If the launch proceeds as scheduled Tuesday from the Kagoshima
Space Center on the southern island of Kyushu, the Muses-A
spacecraft will be sent into a highly elliptical Earth orbit that
will bring it about 10,000 miles from the moon in its first
swing-by on March 18.
   The craft is to release the smaller satellite just before
crossing the moon's orbit. A ``kick motor'' aboard the smaller
craft will propel it into a lunar orbit, the institute says.
   Because the moon orbiter carries no batteries, it will follow a
path that will keep it constantly in sunlight during the first 30
days to allow it to use solar power to send continuous data to the
mother satellite on space temperatures and electric fields, ISAS
says.
   Meanwhile, the larger satellite will continue circling Earth,
swinging by the moon and collecting data on space dust and other
phenomena, ISAS adds.
   This will be the 13th satellite launched by ISAS and the fifth
use of the M3S-2 rocket.

   The new Boy Scout handbook still tells Scouts to
``be prepared'' and how to use a compass, build campfires and tie
knots. But it also aims to help boys cope with life in the '90s.
   The handbook, the first in nine years, features a 23-page insert
on the dangers of child abuse and drugs, a new environmentally
gentle approach to camping, new rules to keep younger Scouts
interested, new merit badges such as cinematography and color
photos in place of the old illustrations.
   The changes are part of a decade-long drive to modernize the
80-year-old organization and boost its membership, which sagged
from 4.8 million in 1972 to 3.1 million in 1979 but has since
rebounded to 4.3 million.
   ``We feel like, as the nation's largest youth development
organization, that young people should be given a knowledge and a
sense of personal power that will help them in their own
protection, whether it be from child abuse or drug abuse,'' said
Lee Sneath, national spokesman for the Boy Scouts of America.
   ``Unfortunately, in today's society these are things that young
people need to be aware of,'' Sneath said.
   The new 10th edition of the Boy Scouts Handbook, as the book is
officially known, is due to be in stores late this month or early
next month. The book has sold in the millions since the first
handbook came out in 1910; the last complete revision was in 1981.
   Many of the changes in the new book reflect revisions already
made in Scout practice. For example, child abuse and drug abuse,
along with problems such as hunger, illiteracy and unemployment,
have been covered in Scout brochures and programs for several years.
   Adults involved in scouting are glad to see the organization
address child abuse. Like other youth organizations, the Scouts
themselves have occasionally been infiltrated by child abusers
posing as helpful volunteers.
   ``I think it's better for scouting that there's more emphasis on
it,'' said Scoutmaster B.R. Heiermann, who leads Troop 445 in the
Dallas suburb of Arlington.
   ``It appalls me when I read news accounts that Scout leaders
have abused kids,'' said Heiermann. ``And that abuse doesn't have
to always be physical. It can be verbal abuse as well.''
   One change in the Scout organization since the handbook was last
revised particularly affects the youngest Scouts, and is aimed at
the 40 percent of Scouts who drop out in their first year.
   The old list of requirements for a boy to advance from the
Tenderfoot rank to First Class _ a major step toward the highest
rank of Eagle Scout _ had swelled to 9{ typed pages. That list has
been cut to less than two pages and there is less emphasis on
earning merit badges at this stage of scouting.
   ``I've found that if boys get to First Class in their first 15
months of scouting, then they're more likely to remain in the
Scouts,'' Heiermann said.
   Another potential turnoff to some boys _ the Scout uniform with
long green knee socks and neckerchief _ has been supplemented with
more contemporary knit shirts, shorts and white athletic socks.
Scouts may wear the casual uniforms on trips and for camping,
saving their dress uniforms for formal occasions.
   Such changes please one Scout who did make it to First Class
level, A.J. Pierce, a sixth-grader in Irving, the Dallas suburb
where the BSA is based.
   Pierce, who wants to become an Air Force pilot someday and
thinks his Scout experience will help him reach that goal, calls
the new handbook ``really great'' and said the changes will make it
easier for more boys to adjust to scouting.
   Sneath blames the enrollment slump of the '70s on the end of the
baby boom and a sentiment against uniforms and organized activities.
   ``The `me' generation is very much an antithesis of Scouts,
which is very much a `we' organization,'' he said.
   Sneath doesn't directly tie the resurgence in enrollment in the
1980s to the organization's new focus, but said there's no doubt
Scout leaders and officials have a better idea of what today's
Scouts want.
   ``The requirements really weren't a problem before,'' Sneath
said. ``But when you deal with 3 to 4 million youths on a regular
basis, you develop a feel for what they're going through.''

   Tens of thousands of Ukrainians joined
hands Sunday in a joyous commemoration of ethnic unity marking the
brief existence of a united, independent Ukraine more than 70 years
ago.
   Organizers of the human chain, leaders of the popular movement
Rukh, said it stretched from the Ukrainian capital Kiev to the
western Ukrainian city of Lvov, about 300 miles, and involved about
100,000 people.
   That could not be confirmed, but in Kiev, block after block of
the city center was lined with smiling Ukrainians holding hands and
waving yellow-and-blue national flags. Many greeted each other with
``Long live the Ukraine,'' and raised three fingers in imitation of
the republic's three-pronged crest.
   The festive and officially-sanctioned chain, with its theme of
unity and pride, displayed a more peaceful side to the awakening
nationalism among Soviet ethnic groups a day after soldiers smashed
through barricades in the Azerbaijan capital Baku in a bid to end
fighting between Azerbaijanis and neighboring Armenians.
   Rukh organized the chain because ``we felt the hunger for
unity'' said Vladimir Yevorisky, one of the movement's leaders.
``We needed to feel we are a people, we are a nation united against
the problems of Chernobyl, economic problems, ecological problems,
and the party apparatus.''
   An April 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant 80
miles north of Kiev, which killed at least 31 people and spread a
cloud of radiation over large parts of northern and central Europe,
was the world's worst atomic accident.
   Kiev is located in the central Ukraine, and there was no effort
to make the chain stretch to the eastern, more Russified part of
the Soviet Union's second-largest republic.
   The chain appeared to be Rukh's most successful show of
strength. A similar event organized by popular fronts in the Baltic
republics in August to mark the anniversary of the 1939 Nazi-Soviet
Pact that led to their annexation drew an extimated 1 million
people.
   In Kiev, the crowd included children and old people, as well as
representatives of a wide range of groups including the
handicapped, Hari Krishnas and Jewish refuseniks.
   Banners proclaiming ``For a United, Independent Ukraine,'' and
``The Ukraine Hasn't Died Yet'' flew alongside hundreds of
Ukrainian flags. Some boys wore pins that said ``This is Our
History. Remember It.''
   On Jan. 22, 1918, amidst the shifting boundaries that followed
the collapse of the Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires a central
Ukrainian council declared a newly united and independent western
and eastern Ukraine.
   It lasted only a few weeks before it succumbed to Bolshevik
troops, but Rukh spokesman Viktor Linchevsky said its existence was
nonetheless historically important.
   ``When they created the republic, the founders knew it was
doomed to failure, but they wanted a legal precedent,'' he said.
   Official Soviet histories traditionally have considered the
western and eastern Ukraine's unification to have taken place in
September 1939 when, under the Nazi-Soviet pact, the Red Army moved
into the western Ukraine and took it from Poland.
   Kiev authorities sanctioned Sunday's chain and a later rally,
showing far more willingness than in the past to cooperate with
Rukh. Rukh meetings frequently have been suppressed in Kiev, unlike
in Lvov, which is considered the center of Ukrainian nationalism.
   Rukh claims some 300,000 members although past protests in Kiev,
where its support is only lukewarm, have drawn only several
thousand people. Its official a strong pro-secession faction.

<HEAD>Peres Opens Talks with Premier On Resuming Ties</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto PRA2</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Vice Premier Shimon Peres
arrived Sunday to discuss the resumption of diplomatic ties with
the reformist government.
   Peres is the highest ranking Israeli official to visit since
1967, when this Warsaw Pact country severed diplomatic relations
with the Jewish state in the wake of the Arab-Israeli Six Day War.
   The official news agency CTK reported that talks with Communist
Premier Marian Calfa opened immediately after Peres began his
two-day visit.
   ``They envisaged resuming diplomatic ties, and the future
cooperation between Czechoslovakia and Israel,'' CTK said.
   The terse report did not elaborate or announce a projected date
for the re-establishment of diplomatic ties.
   On Monday, Peres was scheduled to meet with Czechoslovak
President Vaclav Havel and Parliament Speaker Alexander Dubcek, CTK
said.
   Havel and Dubcek, leaders of the pro-democracy revolution that
forced hard-line Communists from power, were elected by the
Communist-dominated Parliament last month. Free elections are
scheduled for June.
   Peres was also to attend a service in the Altneue Synagogue in
Prague and hold talks with representatives of Czechoslovakia's
newly-formed Social Democratic Movement, the agency said.
   Peres's visit is viewed as another step in Israel's attempt to
improve relations with Eastern European countries, all of which,
except for Romania, broke ties with Israel after the 1967 Middle
East war.
   In September, Hungary became the first East bloc country to
resume diplomatic relations with Israel, and Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens said last week that Czechoslovakia was expected to follow
``in the immediate future.''
   The Soviet Union and Poland have sent low-level diplomatic
representations to Israel in the past two years.
   Two Czech officials were in Israel last week to discuss the
resumption of ties.

   Diners looking for an out-of-the ordinary
eating experience will find knights on horseback and trumpeting
footmen _ but no silverware _ at a soon-to-open restaurant.
   The restaurant, Medieval Times, is a replica of an 11th-century
European fortress. It is scheduled to open in mid-February, and
belongs to a restaurant company of the same name that offers
patrons a taste of the Middle Ages.
   Visitors will see jousting matches, sword fights, tournament
games and other pageantry when they take their seats in the
80,000-square-foot facility.
   Trumpeters herald visitors into the arena, which seats about
1,200 in six sections, said Medieval Times spokesman Andres
Cibotti. Guests are encouraged to cheer for the knight who wears
the same color as their section.
   ``The participation of the people is our main gimmick,'' he
said. ``They really get into it.''
   While ``serfs'' and ``wenches'' in period costumes offer guests
soup, chicken, spare ribs, potatos and the ``king's brew,'' eight
performers on horseback weave around the sandy carousel floor.
   New Jersey is the site of the company's third U.S. restaurant,
joining a castle near Disney World in Florida and another in Buena
Park, Calif.
   The company has had trouble finding employees with the requisite
skills, so it has taken out newspaper ads that read, ``looking for
athletic persons to assist knights in perfomances and to train in
the arts of horsemanship, jousting, weaponry and swordfighting.
Possible advancement to knighthood.''
   Cibotti said newcomers serve an apprenticeship as squires
lasting four to six months, where they train, rehearse and assist
the knights during performances. Knights-in-training participate in
a physical fitness program, practice riding sessions and are taught
basic martial arts and tumbling skills.

   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ Mr. Ed might have borrowed Wilbur's
newspaper to read the comics, but some area horses are getting the
morning paper for an altogether different reason.
   Anne Wolfe of the Hickory Hill Horse Center in Mountaintop says
she started using shredded newspapers to bed stalls for 25 horses
about a year ago.
   ``It's comfortable,'' she said. Newsprint is more economical
than either straw or wood shavings, she said.
   The practice also benefits the environment, Ms. Wolfe said. Not
only is the newsprint recycled by chopping or shredding, but later
it can be spread on farmers' fields as mulch.
   She uses newsstand returns and press overruns of The
(Wilkes-Barre) Times Leader and The Mountaintop Eagle, which she is
given free, said David Daris, The Times Leader's operations
director.
   The newspaper normally pays $60 to $70 per ton to dispose of
extra papers, he said.
   ``I would like nothing better than if all the cows in Luzerne
County slept on The Times Leader,'' Daris said.

<HEAD>Progressive Communists Form Faction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of progressive Communists on Sunday formed
the first de facto faction in decades and said it will work for a
multiparty political system.
   A total of 175 delegates from throughout the country wound up a
two-day meeting by creating a faction called the Democratic
Platform, activist and participant Andrei Koptyaev reported.
   On Saturday, the group decided that if an upcoming meeting of
their party leadership does not accept democratic reforms, they
will split off and form a Social Democratic Party.
   Non-Communist parties are not yet legal under national law,
though Lithuania and Latvia have broken that taboo in recent weeks.
Both Baltic republics dropped their constitutional guarantees of
Communist supremacy and legalized multiparty systems.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev earlier this month dropped
his long-standing objection to alternative political parties,
saying it would be no tragedy if they cropped up in the Soviet
Union.
   The new group's platform calls for radical reform within the
party so it can work in conditions of a multiparty system. On
Sunday, the group elected a 56-member coordinating council
including Communist maverick Boris Yeltsin and fellow progressive
parliamentarians such as Yuri Afanasyev.
   Both are also members of the Inter-Regional Deputies Group, a
group of parliamentarians who had considered but then dropped a
proposal to proclaim themselves a ``political opposition.''
   The national Communist Party has already suffered one
splintering. The Lithuanian Communists voted in December to split
off and form their own Communist Party favoring independence from
the Soviet Union for Lithuania.
   The national Communist Party is scheduled to discuss major
reforms of its structure at a congress in October.
   The progressives are principally concerned with the means of
selecting delegates to the party congress, Koptyaev said.
   In the past, the delegates have been chosen from the top,
ensuring continued support for the status quo. Reformers are hoping
for free election of delegates by the party's rank-and-file in the
belief they will force further reforms throughout the Communist
Party.

<HEAD>Governor Calls for End to Racial Demonstrations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gov. Joe Frank Harris called Sunday for an end to
racial demonstrations in the birthplace of Martin Luther King Jr.,
noting that the protests have cost taxpayers an estimated $1
million this month.
   ``Enough is enough,'' said Harris' press secretary, Barbara
Morgan. ``The point has been made.''
   Harris has previously objected to the cost of law enforcement at
such events.
   More than 2,500 police officers and National Guard soldiers
lined streets near the slain civil-rights leader's tomb Saturday
during a demonstration by four white supremacists led by Richard
Barrett of Mississippi. About 75 sign-carrying counterdemonstrators
separated from the white supremacists by authorities jeered at
Barrett.
   Barrett then traveled to Forsyth County northeast of Atlanta,
where he and one supporter marched. Civil rights leader Hosea
Williams and about 60 supporters also marched in the county. Both
events were without incident, authorities said.
   Georgia Department of Defense spokesman Harry Heath estimated
costs for security at the Atlanta rally at $500,000, plus federal
costs for the National Park Service personnel present. Law
enforcement at a Ku Klux Klan rally at the state Capitol on Jan. 6
cost taxpayers $500,000.
   Heath said costs for such demonstrations would probably always
be high.
   ``When people put in for a permit, we know how large the nucleus
is going to be, but we have no idea how large the
counterdemonstration will be because they don't have to have a
permit,'' he said. ``We have to prepare for the absolute worst.''
   Cumming Police Chief Wayne Lindsey estimated security costs to
his Forsyth County city at $2,500, and Sheriff Wesley Walraven said
county security costs may have ranged from $50,000 to $100,000.
   Saturday's rally came on the heels of the events surrounding the
federal holiday honoring King Jan. 15, and was denounced by
President Bush last week during a visit to Atlanta.
   The governor's spokeswoman called the National Park Service
decision to issue Barrett a permit to hold the rally in front of
King's tomb ``unthinking and insensitive.''
   One of Harris' top aides contacted the White House twice before
the rally to suggest that it be postponed to further separate it
from King Day activities, she said.
   On Jan. 6, more than 2,400 law enforcement officers and National
Guard troops surrounded the state Capitol for a Ku Klux Klan rally,
a year after Barrett led a march in downtown Atlanta that turned
violent as thousands of counterdemonstrators threw rocks and
bottles at the group.
   In January 1987, Williams and a group of marchers were pelted
with rocks and taunted by a crowd in Cumming during a ``brotherhood
march.''
   Williams returned later with an estimated 20,000 supporters in
one of largest civil rights marches in the United States since the
1960s.

<TEXT>
   From ``Stella Dallas'' to ``The Thorn
Birds,'' Barbara Stanwyck won enduring fame with her portrayals of
steadfast, strong-willed women. She played variations of that role
for most of her 82 years.
   The actress, who died of congestive heart failure Saturday, left
an unforgettable gallery of portrayals: The gun-toting ``Annie
Oakley,'' the sharpie who conned Henry Fonda in ``The Lady Eve,''
Gary Cooper's promoter in ``Meet John Doe,'' the wife who persuades
Fred MacMurray to kill her husband in ``Double Indemnity.''
   The film titles tell the story: ``The Miracle Woman'' 1931;
``Gambling Lady'' 1934; ``The Woman in Red'' 1935; ``The Bride
Walks Out'' 1936; ``The Mad Miss Manton'' 1938; ``Lady of
Burlesque'' 1943; ``The Lady Gambles'' 1949; ``Cattle Queen of
Montana'' (with Ronald Reagan) 1954; ``The Maverick Queen'' 1956.
   Her television roles were also powerful: the head of a ranching
clan in ``The Big Valley;'' the Australian matriarch in ``The Thorn
Birds;'' and the imperious Constance Colby in ``The Colbys.''
   Miss Stanwyck, born Ruby Stevens, learned survival as an orphan
in New York City's Brooklyn. She was moved from one foster family
to another and remarked in one of her last interviews, ``I was
always the kitchen maid, cleaning up after the meals. That's why I
never learned to cook.''
   Hoofing in nightclubs provided more lessons in how to survive
and established her lifelong professionalism.
   ``I was always afraid of being fired,'' she said. ``When you
come from where I did and you can be fired at any minute _ this was
before unions _ and you were responsible to feed and clothe
yourself, then you learn to be professional.''
   Miss Stanwyck carried those lessons into her film work. She was
adored by film crews, who called her Missy.
   ``I think it's a matter of caring about people. I care about the
crew,'' she explained. ``These people are my friends. They help me.
I'm with them more than I am with anyone else. ... If they are
happy and contented, the set is good. I can't work under pressure
and duress.''
   The actress had two marriages, and both ended unhappily.
   She married Frank Fay when he was the greatest emcee in
vaudeville and she was a little-known Broadway actress, newly named
Barbara Stanwyck. Both were brought to Hollywood during the talkie
period, and her career zoomed while his faded. The marriage ended
in 1935.
   Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Taylor became one of Hollywood's
storybook marriages, but it ended in 1951. Friends believed she
never fell out of love with the handsome actor.
   Miss Stanwyck never remarried _ ``I never came close.''
   The actress seemed to withdraw in her later years. Her career
was the only focus of her life. And when the roles grew scarce, she
became almost a recluse, seeing only close friends like Jane Wyman
and Nancy Sinatra.
   Although Miss Stanwyck was nominated for an Academy Award four
times, the Oscar eluded her until 1982, when she was presented with
an honorary one for her career.
   In her acceptance speech she thanked her fellow workers in the
studios and added: ``A few years ago, I stood on this stage with
William Holden as a presenter. I loved him very much, and I miss
him. He always wished that I would get an Oscar. And so tonight, my
Golden Boy, you got your wish.''
   Miss Stanwyck had helped Holden through his first starring role
in the 1939 movie ``Golden Boy.'' They remained fast friends until
his death in 1981, and every year he sent her a bouquet of roses on
April 1, the day they started filming ``Golden Boy.''

   Two opposition leaders expelled from Haiti were
welcomed Sunday by fellow exiles in Miami, where they asked for
support in ridding their Caribbean homeland of the government of
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
   Dr. Louis Roy, co-author of Haiti's 1987 constitution, arrived
on a noon flight after being thrown out of his country for the
second time in 30 years.
   ``I was arrested yesterday afternoon and put in jail,'' the
74-year-old civil-rights leader said after arriving at Miami
International Airport. ``This morning, I was put on a Miami flight.
They didn't even tell my why I was arrested.''
   Asked if he was physically abused, he said ``Yes, I was beaten
... in the police department.''
   Avril, who took power in a September 1988 soldiers' revolt that
ousted military leader Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, has promised to hand
over power after elections this year. Avril declared a state of
emergency Saturday and arrested dozens of critics who expressed
doubts about his commitment to democracy.
   Roy, founder of the Haitian Red Cross, was first banished in
1957, when Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier was in power.
   Also addressing reporters Sunday was conservative leader Hubert
de Ronceray, 65, who was expelled Saturday. He said that the
killing that led Avril to declare a state of siege was an
assassination meant for him.
   De Ronceray said Avril's armed forces were aiming for what they
thought was his car when they killed an army colonel driving a
similar auto near de Ronceray's home.
   He said his political colleagues had warned him that Avril
wanted him ``destroyed,'' so he changed his Friday schedule.
   ``They made a mistake and killed the colonel,'' he said.
``Thirty minutes after he was killed, the guards arrived for me.''
   The former vice minister of education under Jean-Claude ``Baby
Doc'' Duvalier said he was then arrested, beaten and thrown in
jail. Once there, he said, guards slapped him, beat him with sticks
and gun butts and even put a cigarette in his eye, which was
noticeably red.
   ``It is clear the United States must help Haiti to stop Mr.
Avril,'' he said in a news conference and rally at the
Haitian-American Republican Council of Dade County.
   De Ronceray said his party would refuse to participate in the
upcoming elections in Haiti because of Avril's military regime,
which he said only ``promised elections to get help from foreign
countries.''
   ``There's no possiblity of democracy with Mr. Avril,'' he said.
``He is a dictator.''
   Members of Miami's Haitian community joined de Ronceray in
asking the United States to help them oust Avril. About 40 Haitians
attended de Ronceray's news conference, and several hundred later
rallied in the neighborhood called Little Haiti in opposition to
Avril and support of the expelled opposition leaders.
   ``The United States is fighting for democracy in the world,'' de
Ronceray said. ``Mr. Avril is demonstating he is able to block the
democratic process.''

   Azerbaijani Turks chanting ``murderer
Gorbachev!'' attended a rally that drew thousands Sunday to protest
the military crackdown in the neighboring Soviet republic of
Azerbaijan.
   About 4,000 people gathered at the central Taksim square and
tried to march to the nearby Soviet Consulate but were blocked by
police.
   Police allowed 20 people to go to the front of the consulate,
where they placed a black wreath reading: ``We denounce the bloody
cooperation of the Russians, Armenians and the West.'' The wreath
also carried an Azerbaijani flag.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent thousands of troops to
the southern republic last week to stop violence between
Azerbaijanis and Armenians. More than 120 people have died in the
fighting in the past week, Soviet officials say.
   Members of the 2 million-member Azerbaijani community on
Saturday demanded that Turkish officials call for an end to the
military action.
   ``We are asking Turkey and the whole world to help stop this
massacre,'' said Ahmet Karaca, president of the Azerbaijani Culture
Association, an organization.
   Turkey said Saturday that the developments in Azerbaijan were
being watched closely and with sadness.
   In Ankara on Sunday, Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz summoned the
Soviet ambassador, Albert Tchernichev, to get information about
developments in Azerbaijan. No details were given.
   Turkey has long borders with Soviet Georgia and Armenia but only
a few miles of border with Azerbaijan.

   Runways sizzled and burst into bloom at summer
couture shows that opened over the weekend.
   The extravagant dream clothes by Gianni Versace, Christian
Lacroix, Hanae Mori and Torrente showed that flowers and feathers
will be hot this summer.
   Italian Gianni Versace got a jump on the French fashion houses
by showing his feathery decollete styles Saturday night at the Ritz
Hotel.
   ``Paris is mine'' crowed the 43-year-old designer, who is not an
official member of the French designers association and was staging
his first show of atelier clothes in the City of Lights.
   Versace turned out witty, minx-like and colorful styles with
enough elaborate beading to create a couture effect.
   ``Great for wives of the mafia,'' groused one resentful French
fashion commentator.
   But Julie Andrews loved them. ``Especially the little sheaths
with boa effects and jeweled necklines,'' said the star.
   Versace is designing the costumes for ``Ch'in Ch'in,'' a new
film starring Miss Andrews and Marcello Mastrioanni and directed by
Gene Saks.
   Versace won hearts with his sexy cuts that were too playful to
be vulgar. His use of elaborate beading, ostrich feathers and
rhinestones on asymmetrically draped long skirts and short skirts
were typical of the inventive Italian.
   His swirled breastplate effects on bustiers vied with
embroidered commedia dell'arte harlequin and abstract effects in
hot colors on lean pants or skirts. Also featured were
ostrich-feather tutu styles and a rhinestone-edged, flame-red
sheath split to the hip.
   Christian Lacroix's show Sunday night at the Intercontinental
Hotel ballroom was no less stunning and began with some wonderful
dressy silk and crepe suits with fitted asymmetrical jackets and
huge rhinestone buttons.
   Lacroix used opulent fabrics, often bringing out his signature
touches like trapeze-shaped coats, enormous puffy sleeves, draped
fichu or shawl effects and the occasional big organza bow-train
down the back. He also brought out some luscious organzas edged in
appliqued flowers.
   Lacroix used clouds of ostrich feathers to give a light touch to
some beautifully cut chiffons and georgette silks in delectable
colors like butter, peach and tea-rose pink.
   And looking at the bias cuts leaves no doubt: Lacroix may be an
artist above all, but he's definitely become a couturier.
   Japanese couturier Hanae Mori _ considered a Paris designer for
more than 15 years now _ showed the sexiest, youngest fashions
she's ever designed.
   Her skirts were often draped, clinging with hemlines way above
the knee, and jackets were fitted and sometimes featured plunging
necklines over sweetheart strapless dresses.
   Brown was a favorite color with Mrs. Mori, and she dolled it up
beautifully in white-striped fitted silk grosgrain suits, draped it
and paired it with lace in slinky evening gowns.
   She also went in for some siren-like vermilion draped silks, and
striking shades like cyclamen purple paired with gold lame.
   Besides her enchanting trademark sequined Japanese landscape and
wave-patterned embroidered dresses, Mrs. Mori also used some of her
favorite motifs _ butterflies and flowers.
   Torrente, whose real name is Rose Mett, also laid on a
lighthearted show that included pique suits with swooped hems on
the fitted jackets for day wear. She dressed up navy crepe suits to
advantage with gold lame rick-rack piping, and some of her great
flower-girl looks centered on enormous anemone print chemise
dresses that looked very easy to wear.
   Among her charming girlish looks were short lace ballerina
dresses and slinky strapless gowns with touches of raffia.

   Up to 10 inches of snow fell across New England on Sunday in a
storm that brought lighter snow, sleet and wind to western New
York, Pennsylvania and the Great Lakes region.
   Skies were mostly fair across the rest of the country.
   The storm moved into New England from the West, dumping 8 inches
of snow on Hartland, Vt. Up to 10 inches fell in parts of New
Hampshire, and a 10-inch accumulation was expected as the storm
moved across Maine.
   The snow hampered travel across New Hampshire and contributed to
numerous accidents, but ski-resort operators welcomed the storm,
since snow accumulation this winter was lagging 9 inches below the
average 27 inches.
   ``We should have a gangbusters weekend,'' said Bill Roy,
operations supervisor at state-owned Cannon Mountain in Franconia,
N.H. ``It's going to give us a nice surface. This will make for
good skiing.''
   Light snow fell on parts of Michigan, northern Wisconsin and
northern Minnesota in the afternoon, and strong, gusty winds
associated with the storm extended west into the Ohio Valley and as
far south as the Carolinas. Freezing rain and sleet fell in warmer
areas hit by the storm.
   Winds reached 61 mph at Johnstown, Pa.
   Fair weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with sunny
skies in the south central and southwestern regions.
   Strong westerly winds blew across the northern Plains, and a
high wind warning was issued for Sunday and Monday for the upper
Yellowstone Valley of Montana. Gusts reached 56 at Livingston,
Mont., and gusts to 70 mph were forecast for Monday.
   In Southern California, dry Santa Ana winds developed, with
gusts up to 50 mph predicted.
   High-temperature records for the date were set in Beckley,
W.Va., where it was 54 degrees, and West Palm Beach, Fla., 86.
Miami tied its high for the date at 85.
   The low for the Lower 48 was 9 degrees below zero at Caribou,
Maine.

   Army and police forces killed 14 Maoist
guerrillas in three separate battles in the Andes, Interior
Ministry reported Sunday.
   A government report said the army and police forces suffered no
casualties.
   In the bloodiest battle, a combined army and police force on
Saturday encountered Shining Path guerrillas near the town of
Huasahuasi, in Junin province, 106 miles northeast of the capital
Lima.
   Six men and one woman in the rebel group were killed in an
ensuing gun battle. Police recovered a large cache of weapons,
including ammunition and explosives.
   The other armed incidents occurred Saturday in Juliaca, province
of Puno, 610 miles southeast of Lima, where about 30 rebels
attacked a police station. Four of the rebels were killed in a
three-hour gun battle, the government said.
   The communique added that a police patrol pursued the other
attackers and killed three of them, two men and one woman.
   The Shining Path has been fighting Peru's elected governments
since 1980. Authorities say more than 17,500 peopleo have died in
the violence, including police, soldiers, rebels, government
officials and civilians.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's ruling Communist Party on
Sunday expelled Egon Krenz, the ousted leader who opened the Berlin
Wall, and lost its popular No. 2 official in a resignation that
could cripple the embattled party.
   The Communists rejected demands to disband but offered the
opposition ``co-responsibility'' in the government until May
elections, abolished their clasped-hands emblem and offered to
change their party's name.
   Tens of thousands of anti-Communist protesters carrying
suitcases marched across the border from Duderstadt to Goettingen,
West Germany, in a symbolic exodus but returned later in the day.
   West Germany's ARD television said about 60,000 people were
involved but police in Goettingen put the number at about 25,000.
   Wolfgang Berghofer, a reformer who was the Communist Party's
deputy chairman, resigned along with 39 other prominent members in
his home city of Dresden, the official news agency ADN said.
   ``With deep regret for our country, we the undersigned declare
our resignation from the Communist Party, and with this step we
include the urgent demand that the Communist Party be broken up,''
Berghofer said in a statement read to reporters in Dresden.
   Three breakaway Communist factions are trying to establish
themselves as separate political forces, and government television
said Berghofer's move put the party's future in ``extreme danger.''
   Berghofer also said he and the others ``support the growing
together of the two German states within the framework of European
unity.'' It was unclear whether he was specifically endorsing
German reunification.
   Berghofer, Dresden's 46-year-old mayor, is credited with helping
to head off a potential massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in
October. He was the first official to call for a free-market
economy.
   Berghofer has been widely reported to be joining the opposition
Social Democratic party, although Sunday's announcement made no
mention of such a step.
   His desertion is expected to spark a further exodus from the
party, whose membership has plunged from nearly 2.3 million in 1987
to 1.2 million currently.
   In a two-day meeting that ended Sunday, the Communists expelled
Krenz and 13 members of the ousted ruling Politburo. It rejected
demands to disband but promised ``radical reform and
consolidation'' and rehabilitated 47 East Germans punished for
speaking out against former hard-line Communist leaders.
   Krenz immediately appealed his expulsion, becoming the first
former top leader to fight back publicly. A dozen former leaders
were kicked out in December and nine are in prison awaiting
corruption trials.
   The official announcement did not specify a reason for Sunday's
purge. However, the Communists are moving to rid themselves of the
last of the top officials associated with Erich Honecker, the
hard-liner replaced by Krenz on Oct. 18 after 18 years in power.
   Honecker was kicked out of the party in December and now faces
an indictment for high treason. Other members of his government
have been accused of corruption.
   Krenz, seen as a Honecker protege, inherited the helm of a
country spinning out of control. Thousands were fleeing daily to
the West while others demonstrated for reform.
   Trying to stem the exodus and remain in power, Krenz opened the
Berlin Wall and other barriers to the West on Nov. 9 and promised
other reform, but he was ousted himself after just six weeks in
office.
   Prosecutors opened a criminal probe against Communist Finance
Minister Uta Nickel, who becomes the first member of Premier Hans
Modrow's coalition government to be accused of wrongdoing.
   Nickel is accused of having been involved in ``illegal
payments'' in her former post as member of the state finance and
price council in Leipzig, ADN said. It did not elaborate.
   After an all-day leadership session Saturday, the Communists
offered the opposition ``co-responsibility'' in the caretaker
government, but it was not immediately clear whether that included
ministerial posts in Modrow's Cabinet.
   A mass-circulation West German newspaper, Bild, reported that
East German secret police and army troops apparently were preparing
a coup in case of another general strike by government opponents.
Bild cited unidentified opposition sources in East Germany.
   Aside from the report, there were no other indications a coup
was being prepared.
   The newspaper said opposition groups will ask for control of the
interior and justice ministries and that if Modrow's government
refuses, they will call for a general strike for Wednesday.

<HEAD>Poll: Boston Residents See Racial Tension As Residual Effect In
Stuart Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of three city residents say the twisted case
of victim-turned-villain Charles Stuart created new tension between
Boston's black and white communties, according to a poll published
Sunday.
   Sixty-seven percent of the 400 people polled said the nationally
publicized case had damaged race relations in the city, while 27
percent said it had not. The remainder expressed no opinion or
declined to comment.
   Public sentiment, however, was not so divided over other issues
involving the slaying of Carol Stuart, whose husband killed himself
after being implicated in the shooting he originally blamed on a
black mugger.
   The poll published in Sunday's editions of the Boston Globe and
broadcast by WBZ-TV showed marked differences among the city's
blacks and whites as to how police and Mayor Raymond L. Flynn
handled the Oct. 23 killing, whether they consider Boston safe and
whether they advocate a police stop-and-search policy.
   Nine of 10 black residents surveyed said they believe the city
Police Department overreacted in its investigation of the Stuart
case, while white residents responded by a 5-4 ratio that the
police response was warranted.
   Flynn, whom many black leaders have blamed for encouraging a
blanket search of the Mission Hill neighborhood following the
murder, still retained support with a 68-percent-to-20 percent
favorable rating that reflected nearly even support from both
blacks and whites.
   Among blacks, 32 percent said they would be less likely to vote
for Flynn for governor because of the Stuart case while 47 percent
said it would have no impact. Among whites, 19 percent said the
case would have a negative effect while 68 percent said it would
have no impact.
   Flynn is considered a potential candidate for governor this fall.
   Experts said the survey, which had a margin of error of plus or
minus 5 percent, clearly indicated that the city's black and white
communities had dissimilar views of the Stuart case.
   ``In question after question there is a clear and significant
difference of opinion between blacks and whites about the case,''
said pollster Gerry Chervinsky of KRC Communications Research,
which handled the poll.
   ``By and large, whites believe there was an action that was
perpetrated by Stuart that duped everybody, and that Flynn, the
district attorney and the Police Department did what they should
have done. The black community doesn't seem to buy into that.''
   Among other findings in the poll:
   _ Seventy-four percent of blacks polled said they believed
police improperly persuaded witnesses to implicate William Bennett,
a black man later cleared in Mrs. Stuart's slaying. That compared
with 42 percent of the whites.
   _ Overall, 57 percent of the respondents said they believe black
suspects in crimes are treated more harshly than white suspects.
Blacks, by a 7-to-1 ratio, said they believe black suspects are
treated more harshly.
   Eighty-five percent of blacks questioned, compared with 51
percent of whites, do not believe police administer justice equally
in all Boston neighborhoods.
   _ Fifty-three percent of blacks questioned, compared with 25
percent of whites, said they do not feel personally safe living in
Boston.
   _ Fifty-five percent of blacks and 49 percent of whites said the
news media had done a below-average job of reporting the story.
   Although Flynn retained a high favorability rating, he and his
colleagues, District Attorney Newman Flanagan and Police
Commissioner Mickey Roache, scored badly in their handling of the
Stuart case with the trio's performance rated below-average by
about 54 percent of blacks and 32 percent of whites.

   Activists on both sides of the abortion issue rallied across the
country Sunday, waging a renewed battle over abortion rights at the
state level the day before the 17th anniversary of the Supreme
Court's Roe vs. Wade ruling.
   In one indication of new fervor over the issue, an estimated
25,000 to 30,000 people joined dueling rallies in Phoenix, where a
demonstration in support of abortion rights drew just 250 a year
ago.
   Elsewhere, demonstrators sang and chanted for abortion rights in
Albany, N.Y, lined up along a busy commercial street in Southern
California and held ``baby showers'' for poor women who choose to
have children in Provo, Utah. Demonstrations also were held in
Boston, Raleigh, N.C., and Spokane, Wash.
   Speakers called for renewed action by state legislatures
following a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision modifying Roe vs.
Wade, which legalized abortion in this country. The summer
decision, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, allowed states
to regulate abortion in some cases.
   ``It may take another year, it may take another five years, it
may take 10 years, but we will bring constitutional protections to
the unborn in the womb,'' Jim Skelly, chairman of the Arizona House
Judiciary Committee, told the Phoenix rally.
   Other rallies were held Saturday. For anti-abortion forces, the
weekend of activity was to culminate Monday with a march on the
U.S. Capitol and other demonstrations around the country. President
Bush was scheduled to address the Washington ``March for Life.''
   Demonstrators Sunday were peaceful, including in Phoenix, where
the anti-abortion group marched past the abortion-rights contingent
and released red balloons. Shouts were exchanged, but police and
rally marshals from both groups kept the peace.
   In Southern California, 5,000 people linked arms to line the
sides of Beach Boulevard along parts of a five-mile stretch through
the cities of Anaheim and Westminster to dramatize their opposition
to abortion.
   A similer ``life chain'' was formed by 2,000 people at the
California Capitol in Sacramento, who cheered fellow demonstrators
in a motorcade led by a hearse plastered with anti-abortion
slogans. About 1,000 abortion-rights supporters trying to stage a
counterdemonstration were forced to rally outside the Capitol Mall
because they lacked a permit.
   In Provo, Utah, right-to-life group sponsored several ``baby
showers'' to gather donated maternity clothes and baby gifts for
needy women who spurned abortion.
   Several thousand anti-abortion demonstrators gathered for a day
of speeches and song at the state Capitol in Oklahoma City.
   One speaker, law professor Teresa Stanton Collett, bemoaned the
state of public debate on the issue.
   ``The abortion dialogue is reducing women on that side of the
street to waving hangers dipped in red paint while women on the
other side are waving signs with gross pictures on them,'' Ms.
Collett said, pointing to pro-choice supporters. ``The debate ought
to be how we deal with women, children and families. Abortion is
the quick fix we can't afford.''
   In Albany, N.Y., abortion-rights activists, some of whom arrived
on cross-country skis in a heavy snowstorm, chanted, sang and
shouted a pledge to lobby their view in the statehouse. As they met
in the legislative office building, about 60 people demonstrated
against abortion.
   ``I pledge not to vote for or support with my money or my time
any candidate for any office who does not fully support and work
for women's equality and the right to safe, legal and accessible
abortion,'' the crowd shouted out in response to Marilyn Fitterman,
president of the New York State chapter of the National
Organization for Women.

<HEAD>Mongolian Communist Party to Cut Privileges For Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mongolia's ruling Communist Party ordered a
reduction in privileges for party officials and said some
``special'' health clinics and a hotel will be made available to
workers, the official Tass news agency said Sunday.
   The report comes a day after a foreign source in the Mongolian
capital, Ulan Bator, said the Communist government banned
demonstrations in the wake of protests by a fledgling pro-reform
movement.
   Tass said in a report from Ulan Bator that the Communist Party's
ruling Politburo approved the decree on cuts to party officials in
preparation of a 20th party congress scheduled for November.
   Tass said the Politburo decided to close a special food store
and reduce the number of official cars.
   The Politburo also ``considered several issues pertaining to
benefits for leading workers,'' Tass said.
   ``It was decided to transfer special clinics to the Ministry of
Health of Mongolia and to transfer to the Central Council of
Mongolian Trade Unions a government hotel complex,'' the news
agency said.
   Hard-line Communist governments ousted in Eastern Europe last
year were criticized for providing lavish perks to party officials.
   The foreign source, contacted by telephone in Ulan Bator, said
Saturday that the city council placed a temporary ban on
demonstrations in squares, main streets, factories and key
enterprises.
   The measure was announced on television and reported in
newspapers Friday, the source said.
   The ban came after three street rallies staged during the past
month by the newly formed Mongolian Democratic Union, a group of
intellectuals and artists advocating a faster pace of economic and
political reform.
   The ban was accompanied by a commentary in the Communist Party
paper Unen on Friday that for the first time criticized the
Mongolian Democratic Union and some of its leading members.
   The article said the group was pushing too far in its campaign
for reform and was failing to listen to the advice of its friends
and elders.
   Mongolia, a nation of 2 million scattered across the vast
deserts and grasslands of eastern Asia between China and the Soviet
Union, has cautiously followed the lead of its patron state, the
Soviet Union, in introducing ``glasnost'' and ``perestroika.''
   However, the inefficient government-run economy still fails to
meet many basic consumer needs, and unlike in Eastern Europe there
has been no challenge to one-party Communist rule.
   According to a report by Tass, the Mongolian Democratic Union
claims a membership of 60,000. It has spoken out against
``commandism,'' the authoritarian methods of party and bureaucratic
powers, and demanded that Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal, Mongolia's
autocratic ruler for more than three decades before he was purged
in 1984, be put on trial.
   Foreign sources in the capital also said a small statue of
Stalin was stolen last week and another prominent statue of the
Soviet leader was splashed with paint. Vandals also threw paint on
a statue of Horloogiyn Choybalsan, the Stalinist leader responsible
for widespread purges during the 1930s. It was not known who was
responsible for the vandalism.

   An Ariane 4 rocket blasted off
Sunday night from the European Space Agency's jungle launch pad,
carrying a French earth observation satellite and several smaller
satellites for U.S. and British clients.
   The 35th Ariane rocket lifted off the launch pad on the northern
coast of South America at 10:35 p.m. The launch had been scheduled
Saturday night, but heavy cloud cover forced a 24-hour postponement.
   Less than half an hour after the launch, Arianespace officials
announced that all the satellites were placed successfully in orbit.
   It was the first time the new generation Ariane 4 rocket was
flown without extra strap-on boosters since the rocket went into
service last year.
   Ariane shots have become routine, and the reliability of the
program has made Arianespace the world's leading provider of
commercial launch services, holding more than 50 percent of the
lucrative international market. Arianespace has a backlog of at
least 32 payloads.
   Sunday's launch carried into orbit French-designed Spot 2 earth
observation satellite, which will replace the Spot 1.
   Among the six microsatellites were a 26-pound Microsat for the
U.S.-based International Association of Amateur Radio Operators,
AMSAT, and an 88-pound Uosat telecommunications satellite for the
University of Surrey in Guildford, England.
   Arianespace, a consortium of European companies, took over the
commercialization of the Ariane program from the European Space
Agency in 1980. It is responsible for building, operating and
marketing launch services.

<TEXT>
   A tanker ran aground in a narrow channel
in Alaska's scenic Inside Passage, spilling an estimated 57,600
gallons of gasoline, the Coast Guard said.
   The spill was not expected to cause widespread environmental
damage because gasoline evaporates quickly, Coast Guard and state
environmental officials said.
   The 400-foot motor vessel Frank H. Brown slammed into Burnt
Island reef about 18 miles south of Petersburg in southeastern
Alaska around 8 p.m. Saturday, said Lt. Rick Janelle in Juneau. One
tank was ruptured but the leak was stopped by about 10 p.m.,
Janelle said.
   The Canadian-owned ship refloated itself about 8:30 a.m. Sunday,
around high tide, said Ed Moreth, another Coast Guard spokesman. It
was taken to nearby Skow Bay, where divers found a two-foot hole in
the hull.
   The tanker's crew measured the amount of gasoline left in the
ruptured tank and found that 57,600 gallons had spilled, Moreth
said.
   The spill is tiny in comparison to the March 24 Exxon Valdez
disaster which dumped 11 million gallons of heavy, long-lasting
crude oil into Alaska waters. Exxon Corp. says it has spent more
than $1 billion cleaning up the nation's largest oil spill.
   By late Sunday the Coast Guard reported three light sheens of
gasoline in the channel, the largest a mile long. ``None of the
fuel is deemed recoverable,'' a news release said.
   ``That type of fuel does dissipate faster than most oil
products,'' Moreth said. ``We expect a lot of it has evaporated or
has broken up. That's what we're looking for.''
   Coast Guard spokesman Greg Robinson said there were no immediate
plans to try to remove the gasoline.
   A private pilot reported seeing gasoline trailing a half-mile
from the vessel, but Coast Guard pilots described it as a thin
``sheen'' of unrecoverable gasoline on the water's surface.
   The state's Crystal Lake Hatchery nearby wasn't threatened by
the spill, fish culturist Bill Davidson said at the salmon hatchery.
   The spill isn't expected to pose a health risk to people in the
area, said Barbara Holian, a spokeswoman for the state Department
of Environmental Conservation.
   Conservation officials were working with fish and game experts
to identify sensitive areas and protect them with booms, she said.
   The spill occurred in the Wrangell Narrows, a 24-mile long
channel amid the mountainous, thickly forested islands of the
Inside Passage, which runs along the Alaskan and Canadian coasts
between Seattle and Juneau.
   Moreth said there were no signs of wildlife damage.
   The captain told the Coast Guard the accident was caused by ``a
judgment error'' but didn't elaborate, said Moreth, who didn't know
the captain's name. The Coast Guard took blood and urine samples
from the crew to test for drug and alcohol use.
   Bad weather prevented the Coast Guard from sending out a
helicopter to inspect the site from the air, Moreth said. Three
Coast Guard cutters were on scene, however, and their crews were
trying to determine the extent of the spill, Moreth said.
   The Coast Guard's California-based Pacific Strike Team of spill
experts arrived in Petersburg to assist the cleanup, he said.
   The vessel has been surrounded by booms to contain any further
leakage.
   ``Plans are to take the vessel to Scow Bay which is just south
of Petersburg,'' Moreth said. ``We'll assess damage there.''
   The owner has hired divers to inspect the outside of the vessel,
and the Coast Guard will board the vessel to inspect the inside to
see if any other cargo tanks have been damaged, he said.
   The owner has hired a tug and barge to remove what fuel remains
aboard the tanker, Moreth said.
   The tanker, owned by White Pass Transportation of Vancouver,
British Columbia, carries 1.8 million gallons of mixed fuels,
including diesel oil, stove oil and gasoline.
   The Wrangell Narrows is a windy channel of water about 18 miles
long that connects Petersburg with larger bodies of water in the
Inside Passage.

<HEAD>Countdown Toward Elections Starts with Diet Resumption</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The countdown toward a crucial parliamentary
election started Monday as a new legislative session opened, and
politicians began consultations expected to lead to nationwide
voting on Feb. 18.
   The election will be critical in showing whether the
long-governing Liberal Democrats can retain voter loyalty in spite
of a series of scandals and public dislike of a new sales tax that
forced two prime ministers out of office last year.
   Emperor Akihito officially opened a joint session of the upper
House of Councillors and the more powerful House of
Representatives, but on Wednesday Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu is
expected to dissolve the lower house.
   Kaifu, who has the final say on dissolving the lower house and
setting the election date, hasn't spoken officially yet, but other
leaders in the governing Liberal Democratic Party have been saying
for weeks that Feb. 18 will be election day.
   The Liberal Democrats hold 297 seats in the 512-seat lower
house, while the Socialist Party, the largest opposition group,
holds only 85, a figure they hope to almost double.
   If the conservative Liberal Democrats fall short of a bare
majority of 257 seats, Japanese politics could be thrown into a
confusing period of coalition-building in which different parties
attempt to group together with enough seats to take a majority in
the lower house.
   The Diet, Japan's Parliament, had been in recess since the end
of 1989. While the upper house, where the opposition had held a
majority since last summer when the Liberal Democrats lost their
majority for the first time in 34 years, opened Monday, the House
of Representatives is not scheduled to resume a plenary session
until Wednesday.
   It is expected that Kaifu will dissolve the lower house as soon
as it opens and declare Feb. 18 the date to elect new members of
that house. The upper house is elected on a separate schedule.
   The election will come about five months early, as the last
election for a four-year term was held July 6, 1986.
   Opening the new session, the emperor declared, ``I hope
earnestly the Diet, the highest organ of state power, will
completely fulfill its mission and meet the people's trust.''
   Akihito said Japan's Parliament strives to improve the people's
lives and to spread peace and prosperity in the world.

<HEAD>Assad Offers Help To Visiting Lebanese President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hafez Assad on Sunday awarded
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi with Syria's highest civilian honor,
the Medal of Merit, after talks on how to end a rebellion in
Lebanon by Christian Gen. Michel Aoun.
   It was Hrawi's first visit outside Lebanon since he was elected
president in November.
   Government spokesman Jibrane Kourieh quoted Assad as pledging
that Syria ``will spare no effort to provide any assistance'' the
Lebanese government requests to implement an Arab League-sponsored
peace plan to end Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   He did not elaborate, but it was a clear reference to Syria
providing troops and tanks to help Hrawi assert his government's
authority over the Christian enclave controlled by Aoun.
   The general refuses to recognize Hrawi or his government and has
branded them ``Syrian puppets.''
   Syria has an estimated 40,000 troops in Lebanon under an Arab
League mandate.
   Government-run Damascus Radio said Assad also awarded medals to
Lebanon's prime minister, Salim Hoss, and Parliament Speaker
Hussein Husseini during the ceremony at the presidential palace.
   It did not say why the awards were made. But the three Lebanese
leaders head a Syrian-backed government that has endorsed the Arab
League peace plan that shifts political power to the Moslem
majority.
   The radio said Hrawi hailed Syria's ``brotherly'' position on
Lebanon and the cooperation between the two countries and thanked
Syria for ``the help it has offered to Lebanon.''
   Hrawi aide May Kahaleh said Hrawi and Assad discussed how to
tighten control of Lebanon's borders to prevent non-Lebanese
entering the country.
   She did not elaborate, but she was apparently referring to
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian guerrillas, who have reestablished
bases in south Lebanon, and are sympathetic to Aoun's cause.
   Hrawi and Assad also want to stop shipments of arms and
ammunition reaching Aoun, who is bottled up in the Christian
enclave north of Beirut.
   Aoun rejects the peace accord, which gives Moslems a greater
share of power with the traditionally dominant Christians, because
it does not provide for a complete Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon.
   Hrawi was elected in November shortly after his predecessor,
Rene Mouawad, was assassinated in Beirut only 17 days after he was
elected.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Charles Luken puts in perspective the
Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of Federated Department Stores Inc., a
corporate cornerstone here for 45 years, by remembering how the
city endured the turmoil surrounding another local institution last
year.
   ``It kind of reminds me of the Pete Rose (gambling
investigation). People used to ask me whether it hurt the city,''
Luken said. ``I used to say the city's bigger than that, and I say
the same in this case.''
   Rose was manager of the Cincinnati Reds until he was banned from
baseball for allegedly betting on the game.
   Now attention is on Federated and Allied Stores Corp., two
Cincinnati-based department store chains that Toronto-based Campeau
Corp. placed under bankruptcy protection last week.
   Federated was founded in 1929 in Columbus by the families that
owned Abraham and Strauss in Brooklyn, Filene's in Boston and
Lazarus in Columbus. Bloomingdale's in New York joined the company
three months later. Federated moved headquarters to Cincinnati in
1945.
   The company has long supported community projects, giving
millions of dollars to charities and civic programs. The Federated
Department Stores Foundation gave $8.5 million last year to such
causes as AIDS research and minority college scholarships,
according to foundation Director Pat Ikeda.
   Ms. Ikeda said she didn't know whether the bankruptcy court
filing would affect the foundation, which is supported by an
independent trust fund.
   ``It's possible that everything will remain the same,'' she said.
   Nevertheless, the mayor said cutbacks at Federated and the time
that financial problems have demanded from executives have
drastically reduced the company's traditional prominence in civic
activities.
   ``They were involved in everything, from the low-income housing
projects to being a primary sponsor of our bicentennial
celebration'' in 1988, Luken said. ``I just don't call them
anymore. It's not life or death, but it's a tremendous resource
that's been lost to us.''
   Another sign of the change is a part of Cincinnati's skyline.
Federated put its 21-story headquarters building up for sale last
week to raise money to service its $5.3 billion debt.
   Campeau Corp. went deeply into debt to buy Federated in April
1988 for $6.6 billion, increasing its original offer by $2.4
billion to win a bidding war with R.H. Macy &amp; Co. of New York.
Campeau had bought Allied Stores Corp. in December 1986 for $3.6
billion.
   Many residents blame Chairman Robert Campeau for Federated's
problems.
   ``I think Campeau and company took what was a viable company and
really screwed it up,'' said Ocie Hammond, a manager at another
Cincinnati corporate heavyweight, Procter &amp; Gamble Co.
   Said Luken: ``I look at this as a glitch resulting from greed
run amok of one individual who didn't care very much for the human
suffering he occasioned on the people who've given their lives to
the company.''
   The problem goes well beyond Campeau himself, though, said John
Williams, president of the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce.
   ``I think that's simplistic. He's the senior man, but I guess I
blame the whole phenomenon of hostile takeovers and the whole slew
of people who profit from them at the expense of the community,''
Williams said.
   Hammond said he was disappointed that Campeau found so many
willing backers. ``Their business plan was overly optimistic, and
to my dismay, the banks bought it,'' he said.
   Federated's department stores remain profitable, but Hammond
said the parent company's financial problems could affect its
ability to attract good employees.
   ``I do recruiting for P&amp;G at colleges, and the image of a
company has a lot to do with whether top students sign up for job
interviews,'' he said.
   Dorothy Speer, a longtime shopper at Lazarus, said she expects
the company's department stores to survive the financial crisis,
even if they are sold to another retail chain.
   ``I think they'll come back,'' she said.
   ``I am concerned that they will close, and I would not like to
see that happen,'' Bonnie Patton, an engineer for AT&amp;T, said
outside the downtown Lazarus store. ``This is the only store in
Cincinnati that has something for everybody. It's the only place I
shop.''

<HEAD>Mary Cunningham Agee Develops Alternatives To Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK WARBIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mary Cunningham Agee has dropped out of the
world of business and profits to pursue a goal closer to her heart:
helping young women make it through unwanted pregnancies. She
believes even abortion-rights advocates can see the value of such
efforts.
   A decade ago, Mrs. Agee made headlines when she was forced to
resign as a Bendix Corp. vice president amid rumors of a romance
with her boss, William Agee. In 1982, the two wed, although they
both deny they were romantically involved during the time she was
at Bendix.
   Since she started the Nurturing Network almost four years ago,
she has helped some 800 middle-class single women have babies from
unplanned pregnancies.
   And as the nation marks Monday's anniversary of Roe vs. Wade,
the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion,
she says, ``People on both sides of the debate can be very much in
favor of what I'm doing.''
   The non-profit network marshals the resources of thousands of
volunteers across the country to help single working women and
college students get through the social stigma, family denial,
financial difficulty and employer animosity caused by ``crisis
pregnancies.''
   ``With all this great discussion about freedom of choice, the
irony was that the choice that was not available was not the
abortion choice, but the birth choice,'' Mrs. Agee said. ``To me,
that was a galvanizing piece of information that continues to be
missed in this very heated discussion.''
   ``The Nurturing Network gave me hope when I despaired early
on,'' wrote Kate, a 23-year-old woman helped by the organization
last fall when she faced the prospect of having to quit her job
because she was pregnant.
   Some pro-choice advocates question the motives of a group with
an agenda so clearly opposed to abortion. Mrs. Agee, 38, is a
devout Roman Catholic.
   ``I would wonder that the purpose might not actually be to help
these women carry to term,'' said Jane Johnson, vice president of
affiliate development and education for the Washington, D.C.-based
Planned Parenthood Federation of America.
   However, Ms. Johnson said, ``so long as women's rights to make
autonomous decisions are not interfered with, I have no problem
with somebody helping them carry out their wishes.''
   Mrs. Agee's ordeal in the spotlight began when William Agee, who
became Bendix chairman and chief executive officer in 1977, hired
the then-Ms. Cunningham and rapidly promoted her. Critics
speculated that her advance up the Bendix ladder stemmed from more
than just talent and a Harvard business degree, although both she
and Agee stoutly denied romantic involvement.
   She resigned as Bendix vice president for strategic planning in
1980, but her and Agee's problems didn't end there. Before she left
the company, the two drafted an aggressive takeover strategy that
resulted in Bendix's disastrous attempt to buy Martin Marietta
Corp. Eventually, Bendix was acquired by what is now Allied-Signal
Inc., Agee left the company and he and Mrs. Agee for a time formed
a venture capital and consulting firm in Massachusetts.
   Mrs. Agee launched the Nurturing Network in Massachusetts in
1986 after having a miscarriage, which she says started her
thinking about the desperation some women feel when abortion seems
like the only alternative. She moved the network to Boise when her
husband was hired as chairman and chief executive officer of
Morrison Knudson Corp. in 1988. The couple have two children.
   Researching the issue, she found that most women who have
abortions are not underprivileged, confused teen-agers, but women
20 to 24 with at least a high school education.
   Many are ``goal-oriented'' women working their way through
college or pursuing a career, unprepared to put their plans aside
but unwilling to end a pregnancy.
   With most assistance programs geared toward helping teen-agers
and the poor, middle-class women in growing numbers have turned to
abortion, Mrs. Agee said.
   To make it easier for such women to avoid abortion if they wish,
Mrs. Agee, a full-time staff of three and dozens of volunteers
recruit physicians, counselors, families, employers, colleges and
financial contributors to the Nurturing Network. It has almost
3,500 members nationwide.
   Members are asked to provide medical care, a job, a temporary
home or a change of schools for network clients, Mrs. Agee said.
The services are tailored to individual needs and many are provided
at no charge.
   Mrs. Agee said many of the woman who seek help don't know about
the Bendix flap and most of those who do are unfazed by her
notoriety.
   Her organization has tried to stay away from the abortion issue,
even as Idaho lawmakers debate whether to enact restrictive
legislation in the wake of last year's U.S. Supreme Court decision
giving states some limited additional authority.
   ``The Nurturing Network is not a forum for me to push forward my
position on abortion,'' Mrs. Agee said. ``My mission is not a
political one but a practical one.''

<HEAD>Delta Reports `Disappointing' Earnings For Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines announced record earnings for
calendar 1989 even though a sharp rise in fuel prices helped
depress earnings by 25 percent in the last three months of the year.
   Delta Chairman Ronald W. Allen said Saturday that the profits
dip in the October-Decmeber quarter also reflected weak passenger
mile yields for Thanksgiving and Christmas, usually two of the
busiest times for the airline.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, the carrier's fiscal second
quarter, Delta's net income was $64.2 million or $1.13 a share,
down from $85.2 million or $1.73 a share a year earlier.
   Net income for calendar 1989 was $473.2 million or $9.23 a
share, up 37 percent from $344.5 million or $7.03 a share in 1988.
   Operating revenue in the latest quarter rose to $2.04 billion
from $1.9 billion a year earlier. But fuel costs rose to $314.2
million in the quarter from $220.5 million.
   Major U.S. airlines have cited higher fuel costs as the reason
for fare hikes announced this month.
   ``We are very pleased with the record earnings for calendar 1989
but are disappointed with the lower earnings in the December
quarter,'' Allen said. ``Fuel expenses rose 43 percent, the result
of a 34 percent jump in the average price of aircraft fuel.''
   Allen said passenger mile yields _ the money taken in per
passenger for each mile flown _ fell about 1 percent during the
holiday season to 13.39 cents from 13.48 cents a year earlier.
   Delta made numerous strides in 1989, Allen said. He said they
included a 15 percent increase in traffic growth, a 5 percent
increase in capacity growth, the addition of seven new domestic
cities and two internationally in the route system and maintaining
a young age for its fleet of aircraft.

<HEAD>Dollar Remains Firm, Stock Prices Gain Moderately in Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar remained firm in early trading against
the Japanese yen Monday while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange gained moderately.
   The dollar started trading at 146.35 yen, up 0.02 yen from last
Friday's close of 146.33 yen.
   ``The yen is a currency that many investors will avoid buying
this week'' ahead of the expected dissolution of Japan's lower
house of parliament, a currency dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu is expected to dissolve the
512-member House of Representatives Wednesday, with balloting set
for Feb. 18, local news media said.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which gained 107.08 points last Friday, added another
101.39 points, or 0.27 percent, shortly after the market opened to
stand at 36,937.93.

<HEAD>Tentative Contract Reached</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for USAir and more than 6,000
pilots have reached a tentative contract agreement following 27
hours of talks.
   The proposed settlement still must be approved by the Airline
Pilots Association's master executive council, scheduled to meet
Thursday.
   Chris Beebe, the council's vice chairman, said the panel can
ratify the contract, return it to negotiators for further
consideration or send it to the membership for ratification. The
agreement was reached Friday in Miami.
   ``It's been a very, very long drawn-out process,'' Beebe said.
``With this much time and effort invested, to do anything hastily
would be a mistake.''
   The pilots have been working under terms of a contract that was
open for amendment on Aug. 31, 1989. It is the longest USAir pilots
have worked without a new pact.
   Neither Beebe nor USAir spokesman John Bronson would release
terms of the proposal.
   The lack of a contract had hampered USAir from completing its
merger with Piedmont Airlines. From August through December, former
Piedmont pilots flew only aircraft from that airline and USAir
pilots used only pre-merger USAir equipment.
   A transition agreement allowing crews to use planes from either
airline took effect Jan. 1.
   USAir, meanwhile, remains locked in a dispute with the
Teamsters, which is trying to organize some 8,000 baggage handlers
and ramp workers in the merged airline. The National Mediation
Board will count election ballots Jan. 30.
