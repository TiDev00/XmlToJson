   Young marriages face tough odds, but
Todd and Bonnie Longsine seemed off to a good start and headed away
from some of the troubles of their adolescent years.
   The two teen-agers owned a three-bedroom mobile home, a car and
a pickup truck and had a happy 14-month-old son, Josh, whose blond
hair and blue eyes charmed their friends.
   But Longsine, 19, turned against his family this week, fatally
shooting 18-year-old Bonnie, setting a fire that killed Josh and
then ending his own life. Their bodies were found Thursday by a
repairman making a service call to their trailer.
   No suicide note was found, leaving their neighbors in the
Country Estates Mobile Home Park in Greenville, a town of 225 in
northeastern Wisconsin, without explanations.
   ``From what I could tell from Todd and Bonnie, everything seemed
to be fine,'' neighbor Kathy Nichols said. ``It seemed like he had
it together. He was happy to be a father.''
   The couple married in October 1988, a month or so before Josh
was born, and bought their trailer home a year later. Todd
graduated from Menasha High School in 1988, worked at a warehouse
for a brief time and then enrolled in a trade school to learn metal
welding. Bonnie was a waitress in nearby Appleton, hoping to move
up to management.
   Their actions seemed to be cutting a path away from their rocky
adolescence, when Todd had some skirmishes with the law and Bonnie
dropped out of Menasha High before her junior year.
   But not everybody believed that all was well with the couple.
   Wendy Reiland, a friend of Mrs. Longsine's, said the young
mother wanted out within months of the marriage, then changed her
mind. The couple filed a joint divorce petition a year ago, then
withdrew it last summer.
   A neighbor, Krista Vollmer, saw a ``for sale'' sign in the
window of their trailer one day earlier this month. Officials at
Fox Valley Technical College said Todd failed to register Jan. 19
for the spring semester.
   Outagamie County Sheriff Thomas Drootsan said the .22-caliber
rifle that Longsine used was bought just this week. He shot Bonnie,
set the fire outside Josh's bedroom that asphyxiated the toddler as
he slept, and then shot himself, authorities said. The deaths went
undetected until the repairman's call Thursday because the fire
burned itself out.
   Sheriff's Capt. Gary Barrington said Friday that Longsine had a
juvenile record, including an arrest for disorderly conduct, but
had not been in major trouble. There were no reports of wife or
child abuse during the marriage, authorities said.
   ``I wish we had a real good motive to lay on you, but right now
we don't,'' Barrington said.
   Longsine's step-grandmother, Irene Stoeger, said she remembered
her grandson's being in trouble while growing up. His mother
``reported him to the police department a lot,'' Ms. Stoeger said.
``Quite a few years ago, Todd went on a rampage. He got mad.''
   Police in Menasha said they investigated Longsine to see if he
was helping Bonnie hide when she ran away from home in spring 1988
at age 17. He was not charged with anything and she eventually came
back home.
   Mrs. Longsine's mother, Barb Godeck, said Friday that the family
had reservations about Longsine when the two married later that
year. The couple had met at a dance, she said.
   ``There were probably a lot of things we weren't pleased
about,'' she said. ``Sometimes you think you know someone and you
really don't.
   ``Bonnie was a very loving person,'' her mother added. ``Anyone
who knew her liked her. She had no enemies.''
   Mrs. Longsine's boss at Marc's Big Boy restaurant, Dave
Anderson, called her a hard worker. He said she seemed quieter,
somewhat tense the last two weeks.
   ``We had ideas she was having marriage problems, but to what
extent? Everybody goes through marriage problems,'' he said. ``As
far as we knew, they were doing OK financially.''

   When the editor of The Sunday Times sues the
former editor of The Sunday Telegraph for libel, fascinating issues
are aired in court.
   Does it behoove ``hommes serieux'' to be seen in nightclubs?
   Should two editors pursue the same woman?
   If a bimbette is a younger bimbo, then what is an ``aging
bimbette?''
   Those issues arose this week as Andrew Neil, editor of The
Sunday Times, waged his libel suit against Peregrine Worsthorne,
former editor of The Sunday Telegraph.
   It's jam for the tabloids, of course, but the usually sober
quality papers also are enjoying a wallow in a case rife with the
personal and professional passions of Fleet Street, London's
historic newspaper district.
   Neil alleges that Worsthorne and The Sunday Telegraph falsely
implied that he knew that Pamella Bordes, his girlfriend for four
months in 1988, was a prostitute.
   Miss Bordes, a former Miss India, was a low-paid researcher in
the House of Commons a year ago when a tabloid broke the story of
her other life.
   That created a hot market for photos of Miss Bordes, including
one of her on the dance floor with Neil and another of her holding
hands with Neil's Sunday competitor, Donald Trelford, editor of The
Observer.
   In an editorial titled ``Playboys as Editors'' in the March 19
Sunday Telegraph, Worsthorne thundered that ``anybody who finds the
company of bimbos ... indispensable to their professional
fulfillment might do well to conclude that editorial chairs were
not designed for them.''
   Neil, a stocky, 40-year-old bachelor, alleges that the
editorial, a cartoon and a subsequent article by another writer
falsely implied that he knew that his girlfriend was a prostitute.
   The principals in the case are all well-acquainted. Rupert
Murdoch owns The Sunday Times as well as The News of the World,
which broke the Bordes story. After Worsthorne's editorial, Neil
acknowledged, The Sunday Times had tried to hire him, and it has
hired the author of the other Sunday Telegraph article cited in the
suit.
   The defendants say Worsthorne's editorial was fair comment and
not, as opposing counsel suggested, ``an overwritten piece of
humbug.''
   ``Newspapers are not in the business of being particularly
tolerant or understanding about public figures when they get into a
scandal,'' testified Worsthorne, a patrician figure with flowing
silver hair.
   Neil met Miss Bordes at a club called Tramp, which Worsthorne
regards as no fit milieu for the editor of The Sunday Times.
   It is not a place where one is apt to meet the archbishop of
Canterbury, the prime minister ``or even an archdeacon,''
Worsthorne said, but a place where most men go ``for one reason _
to pick up girls.'' At least, he said on cross-examination, that's
why he used to go to nightclubs.
   Editors, Worsthorne said, once were ``hommes serieux,'' serious
men who frequented ``learned seminars, European chancelleries,
establishment dinners.''
   Neil said he had become aware that Trelford also was interested
in Miss Bordes, but Neil warned Trelford away ``because I thought
no newspaper could resist a story of two editors and the same
woman.''
   After a headline in The Sun, Murdoch's big-selling daily, called
Trelford ``Dirty Don,'' Trelford publicly wondered why there was no
mention of ``Randy Andy'' Neil.
   The Sun made amends with Thursday's screamer headline:
   ``DIRTY DON TRIED TO PULL MY PAM SAYS RANDY ANDY''
   Earlier in the week, Mr. Justice Michael Davis was puzzled by
the terminology in the gossip columns. ``Mr. Neil,'' the judge
interjected, ``we heard yesterday the word bimbo. I presume a
bimbette is a young bimbo. But can you help us? What is an `aging
bimbette'?''
   Neil said he did not know.
   Worsthorne was at least prepared to define a bimbo: ``An
obviously very attractive young girl who tends to bat her eyelids
and has a very attractive frontal _ whatever the correct word is.''

   The defeat of U.S. legislation that would have
helped Chinese students extend their stays in the United States is
not likely to reverse China's course of tightening exit controls.
   The door already has closed significantly on what had been the
freest period for exit from China in its 40 years of Communist
rule, during which almost anyone who could get a scholarship abroad
and a foreign visa was able to go.
   Regulations being circulated internally bar anyone under 30 or
with less than five years of work experience from obtaining
official sponsorship to study abroad, sources in the education
bureaucracy said this week.
   Other measures have made it harder for students to take tests
for study abroad and obtain passports without official sponsorship.
   Fear of its students not returning home is only one reason for
China's shift in policy.
   More basic is the government's fear that too many students are
returning with anti-socialist ideas that could undermine their
hard-won Communist revolution.
   In September, Premier Li Peng set out the new policy:
``Henceforth, those being sent to study abroad should mainly be
visiting scholars and researchers because these people are older
and more mature politically.''
   More than educational exchanges were at stake in the showdown
between the U.S. Congress and President Bush, however.
   A biting front-page editorial Friday in the party newspaper, the
People's Daily, said if the legislation passed, the United States
``shall be held responsible for the grave consequences.''
   It called the bill a ``naked expression of power politics,'' and
said its supporters were ``anti-China addicts'' who hoped to coerce
China into giving up socialism.
   The bill would have waived a requirement the estimated 32,000
Chinese in the United States as official exchange students return
home for two years before seeking new U.S. visas to work or
continue study. Its goal was to protect students who feared
retribution for protesting China's crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators in June.
   Both houses of Congress passed the bill in November but Bush
vetoed it. The House of Representatives voted Thursday to override
the veto, but the Senate's 62-37 vote Friday in favor of the bill
fell four short of the necessary two-thirds margin for an override.
   China did not comment on the bill's defeat, although it was
reported on national television and radio.
   Bush's veto of the bill was one of a series of conciliatory U.S.
steps that halted the serious deterioration in U.S.-Chinese
relations after June. After the December visit of Bush's national
security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, China softened its comments on
dissidents Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, who have been
hiding in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing since June.
   However, Bush's success in quashing the controversial bill does
not guarantee a speedy solution to the Fangs' dilemma. China has
little reason to push for a resolution, which would require
compromise on its part. Indications are that China continues to
insist the Fangs promise not to make political statements if they
are allowed to go to a third country _ a promise that those who
know Fang believe he will not make.
   Moreover, the strong support for the bill in Congress and among
the American public reveal ideological tensions that will prevent
bilateral relations from returning to their rosy pre-June state.
   Americans have been awakened to the harsher side of China's
Communist rule, and Chinese leaders have stressed the need for
vigilance against what they consider subversive American notions of
democracy.
   China won't stop sending students abroad _ they are vital to its
plans for absorbing advanced technology _ but it will take
strenuous measures to ensure that those who go abroad are loyal
socialists and return that way.

<HEAD>Romantic, Feminine Styles Winners in Summer Couture</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Saturday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romance and femininity were in the air and on the
runways as top designers unveiled their summer haute couture
offerings.
   Short skirts, curvy silhouettes, swooping decolletes and
charming colors were the most striking messages in the week of
shows. If the top designers have guessed right, women want to be
more feminine than ever as the new decade begins.
   There were also plenty of well-cut pants for daytime or evening
as an alternative to women who would rather hide than bare their
legs.
   It was a roller coaster week. The grandmasters like Yves Saint
Laurent, Hubert de Givenchy, Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel and new
master Christian Lacroix triumphed.
   Paco Rabanne, a 56-year-old Spanish-born designer, won the
Golden Thimble award. Having worked in Paris for nearly 40 years,
Rabanne finally overcame his ``metallic sculptor'' image to receive
the coveted prize awarded twice yearly by fashion writers.
   But things didn't go so well in houses with new couture creators
drawn from the ranks of ready-to-wear. The inventive Claude
Montana, who took over as Lanvin's haute couture designer, drew
sullen reviews.
   Although purely Montana, his clothes featuring mainly skinny
pants with various toppers looked too self-consciously
``futuristic'' for the moneyed set that's used to feminine clothes
from Lanvin.
   Another flop was Angelo Tarlazzi's second collection for Guy
Laroche. Although he had some zingy raffia-bordered south-of-the
border stuff plus cute stitched peasant dresses and gringo pants,
the show didn't quite make the couture grade.
   But there was much to remember elsewhere, and the beauty of
couture is that each client _ and those who are inspired by couture
looks _ can opt for skirt lengths longer than the sensational
runway models.
   Who's going to wear this, wonder bemused TV spectators treated
to snippets of the spectacular shows. The answer is hardly anybody.
   The outfits costing around $10,000 and bought by only a handful
of women are mainly money-losers for the big-name houses. But the
designers' renown serves to give the houses big publicity and
promote sales of the real moneymakers _ perfume and cosmetics,
ready-to-wear and accessories.
   Gossamer-light luxury fabrics made these clothes look lighter
than ever, though Yves Saint Laurent won kudos for his sleek white
suits in heavy pique, ridged tussore, and Shantung silk.
   Memorable styles included the Lolita charmers at Chanel, though
most real women couldn't wear the teeny hint-of-chiffon skirts in
delightful shades of coral and pink peeping under the sharply
fitted long jackets.
   Christian Lacroix had a field day with the light fabrics,
mounding clouds of organza, lace or faille on wrapped or puffed
skirts under skimpy or decollete tops for his incomparable
high-waisted, trapeze look of luxury.
   The shoulder issue is irrelevant, because Saint Laurent and
Givenchy's bold-shouldered daytime silhouettes still look elegant,
while at Lacroix, Chanel, Dior and elsewhere they are mainly hidden
under big organza collars or discreetly small and rounded by
minimal padding.
   As in ready-to-wear that's already appearing in the shops, the
bosom is a big couture winner. Many suits or draped dresses have
slashed decollete effects.
   And transparent blouses are around _ although far from
exclusively _ for those who want see-through chic.
   Evening wear inevitably bares shoulders, pushing up bosoms under
strapless bustiers or daring decolletes a la Belle Epoque or the
18th century look of Marie-Antoinette.
   Other outstanding couture offerings included Jean-Louis
Scherrer's repeat trip to the fabulous India of the Raj. His
jeweled, lace-embroidered light silk draped dresses or trouser
outfits in white or tender pastels were an exercise in opulent
beauty.
   Ungaro made a hit by trimming down his line to the couture
basics. His line of colorful short coat-dresses and suits combining
arabesques of several bright colors were a delight to the eye.
   Typical of the haute couture were sophisticated draped and
split-skirt models in sumptuous light fabrics at Balmain by
designer Erik Mortensen.
   Fabric trends for the new soft looks include gabardine,
cashmere, raw silk and textured linen, as well as shantung, silk
crepe and cotton pique for daytime to the cocktail hour.
   For evening, romance came out in silk faille, satin and clouds
of organza and chiffon. There's also lots of delicate or heavier
guipure lace, plus re-embroidery and appliqued motifs, pearls,
sequins and feathers.
   The color palette includes lots of white and ivory, regulation
spring navy and brighter peacock blues. Khaki, tobacco, desert
beige and chartreuse flash into sunbursts of yellows and mandarin
orange, with gleaming lashings of gold brocade and lame for evening.
   Pastels range from flesh tones to the most delicate eggshell
pinks and blues and absinthe green. Violet, salmon, flame and
fuchsia reds were outstanding in a brighter vein.
   To go with this couture splendor, there were all kinds of
eye-catching headgear, from satin turbans to enormous circular
haloes at Cardin, funny visored pillboxes and piecrust-crimped
crowns at Givenchy.
   Chanel showed new boaters with bows under the brims, and
Valentino topped many of his sophisticated models with hats that
had trellis-style woven brims matching latticework on some of the
dresses.

   Manuel Noriega may have tried to put a curse on
U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and the judge in his case,
federal prosecutors suggested Friday at the deposed Panamanian
leader's bond hearing.
   When invading U.S. troops raided a Noriega office now referred
to as the ``Witch House'' _ a room in his headquarters at Fort
Amador just outside Panama City _ they found black magic
paraphernalia, including an altar.
   One soldier described signs of animal entrails and ``vats of
blood,'' as well as a portrait of Adolf Hitler.
   On Friday, Deputy Assistant U.S. Attorney Myles Malman asked
U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler to deny bond to Noriega
because he was a danger to the community, citing among other
reasons a ``white sheet of paper with four names on it'' that the
troops found with the other items in the ``Witch House.''
   The list consisted of Thornburgh; Charles Sapho, the head
Justice Department's drug section; Mark Schnapp, a former Miami
federal prosecutor partly responsible for the Noriega indictment _
and Hoeveler himself.
   Malman did not mention a curse, but such lists are sometimes put
on altars by practitioners of voodoo-like Afro-Caribbean religions
to place a hex on those named.
   ``Maybe I better not enter it into evidence,'' the judge joked
as Malman handed him the list.
   Hoeveler later denied bond to Noriega.

<HEAD>Louella Luhrman, Nation's Oldest Vet, Dies at 108</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Louella Luhrman, a World War I Army
nurse who was described as the nation's oldest veteran, died Friday
at age 108.
   Luhrman, who joined the Army in 1918 when she was 36 years old,
spent her military service at Camp Lewis, Washington. She was
discharged in 1919.
   ``She is going to be a great loss,'' said Jean Kohr, the head
nurse at Luhrman's ward at the Veteran's Administration Hospital.
``She had a wonderful sense of humor.''
   Luhrman was born in Germany on Dec. 8, 1881, and emigrated to
the United States with her family two years later, coming across
the Atlantic in a sailing ship.
   The family first settled in Marysville, Calif., but after a few
years moved to the San Jose area where Luhrman was to live off and
on for much of her life.
   ``Up until 1986, Lou heard well enough to respond directly to
questions asked by reporters,'' said her niece, France Malavos.
   She was interviewed on Veteran's Day that year and was asked
what advice she had for world leaders.
   ``Peace,'' she said. ``Peace at any price. One people, we belong
to one people.''
   Luhrman became the nation's oldest veteran in 1987 when Jasper
Garrison of Illinois died at the age of 107. Garrison served in the
Spanish-American War.
   In the nation's capital, Veterans Administration spokesman Don
Smith said he did not know immediately who is now the oldest
veteran.
   ``There are still several veterans at least 100 years old,
including Nathan Cook, a Spanish-American War veteran at our
hospital in Prescott, Arizona,'' said Smith. ``He's 104.''
   Luhrman never married but was the aunt to nine nieces and
nephews, grand-aunt to 30 and great grand-aunt to 38.
   She earned her nursing degree from Fabiola Hospital in Oakland
in 1905 and worked there until she joined the Army, according to
Holly Fletcher, spokeswoman for the Department of Veterans Affairs.
   Luhrman returned to Fabiola Hospital after the war and worked
there until the facility closed in 1932. She then became a nurse at
Peralta Hospital in Oakland from where she retired in 1943.
   In the 1986 interview, Luhrman attributed her long life to a
balanced diet, being able to put aside worries and living life to
the fullest.
   ``I hope people will think well of me,'' she had said. ``That's
all I wish for.''

   Former first lady Betty Ford honored
former White House press secretary James Brady, his wife, Sarah,
and a second couple for using their experiences with adversity to
help others.
   Mrs. Ford on Friday presented the Bradys and Kirk and Karen Ball
of Aurora with the first Betty Ford awards at a ceremony in Beaver
Creek, where Mrs. Ford and former President Gerald Ford own a home.
   ``It is gratifying to be involved with an award that recognizes
the inner strength of individuals and their selflessness in aiding
others,'' said Mrs. Ford, whose Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage,
Calif., treats chemical dependency.
   The Bradys were honored for their efforts to gain passage of
national handgun control legislation. James Brady, 49, was shot in
the head during an assassination attempt on President Reagan in
1981. Brady remains partially paralyzed.
   Mrs. Brady is vice chairman of Handgun Control Inc., a citizens'
group that lobbies for passage of federal legislation to place
tighter controls on handguns.
   Kirk Ball, 31, and his wife, Karen, 32, have a 4-year-old
daughter, Kaelin, who was born with a port-wine stain on both sides
of her face. Doctors told the Balls the stain is a symptom of a
rare, progressive disease known as Sturge-Weber Syndrome. Other
symptoms include eye problems, seizures, partial paralysis and even
mental retardation.
   They started the Sturge-Weber Foundation to help other parents
learn more about the disease and to encourage research. The
foundation now has more than 300 members worldwide.

   The suspended superintendent of the Camp
Hill prison was fired Friday for his actions during a three-day
riot last year that left 123 people injured and more than half the
institution in ruins.
   The dismissals of Superintendent Robert Freeman and one of his
deputies were based on a recommendation by Gov. Robert P. Casey,
who said Friday that Freeman was among the officials with primary
responsibility for maintaining order.
   Casey concluded that ``those having responsibility for security
... (should) be held accountable for their actions.''
   Three days of rioting at Camp Hill in October left 123 inmates,
officers and firefighters injured and caused an estimated $14
million in damage. Administrators declared the prison secure after
a first night of rioting Oct. 25, but inmates were able to free
themselves and continued their rampage through Oct. 27.
   On Nov. 1, just days after the rioting ended, The Associated
Press reported that guards had complained that prison officials
ignored warnings of cell-locking mechanisms being broken after the
first night of rioting on Oct. 25.
   Freeman was suspended without pay the same day. Attempts to
reach him for comment on his firing were unsuccessful because his
telephone number is unlisted.
   Also fired was Camp Hill's deputy for operations, Robert Smith,
said Corrections Department spokesman Kenneth Robinson. The
spokesman said the dismissals were ordered by state Prison
Commissioner David S. Owens Jr. on the governor's recommendation.
   Terry Henry, Camp Hill's deputy for treatment, will be
reassigned within the department, Robinson said. The governor said
he would have recommended the dismissal of Maj. John Stover,
captain of the guard, but Stover had resigned.
   In a news release, Casey cited the findings of an independent
three-member investigative commission that concluded management at
Camp Hill had failed to adequately search the prison after the
first night of rioting. Management also failed to assure that cells
were locked despite warnings that they weren't secure, the
commission found.
   The commission, which presented its report in December, also
said that supervisory personnel had failed to keep an adequate
force of state troopers at the prison to prevent a second night of
rioting, and that ample time was available for management to
reconsider its decisions.
   The panel criticized Owens, the prison commissioner, for his
``hands-off'' dealing with the riots, but the governor said he had
confidence in Owens.
   ``The commission recognized that direct and primary
responsibility for the security at Camp Hill did not rest with
him,'' Casey said. ``I have concluded that Commissioner Owens
carried out his responsibilities in a competent and professional
manner.''
   Robinson said acting Superintendent Jeffrey Beard would remain
in place at the prison.

<HEAD>Mayors Say Bush Fighting Drugs With Words, Not Money</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Big-city mayors, disappointed with President
Bush's anti-drug efforts, are asking the administration and
Congress to cut defense spending and raise taxes to finance
solutions for inner-city problems.
   The U.S. Conference of Mayors ended its three-day winter meeting
Friday after the president urged them to support his new drug
strategy and proposal to increase federal anti-narcotics drug
spending by $1.1 billion.
   But the mayors had more money in mind, and the group's
policy-making executive committee adopted a resolution urging the
immediate use of a ``peace dividend, in conjuction with increased
revenues,'' for an injection of new aid for America's cities.
   ``The Bush administration's approach is to force the poor people
to decide between heating and eating,'' said Newark, N.J., Mayor
Sharpe James, a Democrat. ``I think they need both.''
   The resolution was proposed by Madison, Wis., Mayor Paul Soglin.
It repeats the mayors' longstanding call for more federal taxes to
finance urban needs. It adds the so-called peace dividend, saying
the lessening of world tensions and crumbling of communism in
Eastern Europe should leave military money available for such
pressing domestic needs as poverty, homelessness, AIDS and drugs.
   New York Mayor David Dinkins, in backing the proposal, said:
``The `peace dividend' is not the entire answer, but it is a good
start. A mere 5 percent savings in defense spending will yield $15
billion that could be used for much-needed urban programs.''
   Bush appealed to the overwhelmingly Democratic Conference of
Mayors one day after unveiling his revised plan for fighting drugs.
He offered the mayors no specifics and no other initiatives on
urban problems.
   He repeated his call for more private efforts, pledging to use
his ``bully pulpit'' to ask for volunteers.
   ``Let's join hands to inspire the millions of Americans who want
to help America get clean and stay clean,'' he said. ``Together,
let's defeat public enemy No. 1.''
   But some mayors questioned whether the administration was really
making drugs its top priority and faulted Bush for failing to
provide enough money to make drug rehabilitation treatment
available to any drug user who wants it.
   ``We have not yet seen a level of commitment in line with the
size of the problem,'' said Mayor Kathyrn Whitmire of Houston,
president of the conference and the elected leader of Bush's
adopted hometown. ``We have not yet seen it move to the top of the
agenda in the federal government.''
   Mayors interviewed after the speech said they appreciated the
symbolic support his appearance provided but that Bush had offered
the cities little that was new.
   ``I guess you have to give the president a `B' for showing up,''
said Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, a Democrat.
   ``I think there is strong disagreement as to how to proceed to
address some of the issues of urban America that have been ignored
for such a long period of time,'' he said.
   ``I like what he said about education,'' said Mayor Karen Vialle
of Tacoma, Wash. ``But we need the bucks to do it.''
   Whitmire, however, said city officials believe the Bush
administration is more receptive to the mayors than President
Reagan was. Reagan never addressed the Conference of Mayors in his
eight years as president.
   ``I think his presence here indicates a little more willinginess
to discuss those disagreements and see if something can be worked
out,'' she said.

   A group of disgruntled residents of
this desert resort city has abandoned a recall effort against Mayor
Sonny Bono.
   Ron Winkler, a member of Save Palm Springs, said the recall
``basically just died out.'' One group member said more than 2,000
signatures had been gathered _ about half the number needed to
trigger a special election.
   The group accused Bono, 54, of using the office to revive a
flagging show business career, among other things.
   ``We thought Sonny Bono was a joke when we started and he is
still a joke,'' said Dick Sroda, another member of Save Palm
Springs. ``At the present time, he is laying a little low, which is
good.
   ``I think the campaigning for signatures had some effect on him.
He seems to be a little more conscious of the people.''
   Bono, who has started a film festival and championed other
efforts to revitalize the city's image, could not be reached by
telephone at City Hall after business hours on Friday.
   The songwriter and nightclub singer was teamed for years with
his ex-wife, Cher.

   Sheik Mohammed al-Fassi's bayfront
mansion was invaded by police, prosecutors and Humane Society
investigators who seized dozens of cats suspected of being
mistreated, police said.
   About 30 cats found roaming the grounds of the sheik's ``Al
Shams'' Palace on Biscayne Bay were loaded into crates and
cardboard carriers Thursday and turned over to the Humane Society,
Miami Beach police spokesman Tom Hoolahan said.
   ``It was for purposes of protecting the animals,'' Hoolahan said
Friday.
   Last year, al-Fassi launched a one-man campaign to save the
homeless cats of the world, inviting people to drop off unwanted
felines at his luxury home. An aide to the sheik, Talaat Reafat,
denied the cats had been mistreated.
   The sheik, who faces a warrant for his arrest because he owes
$80,000 in back alimony to his ex-wife and unpaid legal fees to
some of his former attorneys, has not been home since November,
Hoolahan said.

   An Internal Revenue Service auction of property
belonging to comedian Redd Foxx was set for today, but a judge
delayed the sale for a month.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Clive Jones issued a 30-day stay on
Friday despite protests by IRS attorneys and auctioneer Robert
Deiro.
   Deiro said ``hundreds of people are descending on the city''
from as far away as Asia for the sale. He said Foxx would suffer
from the delay because many who planned to attend today's sale
would not return.
   ``I feel Mr. Foxx has shot himself in the foot,'' Deiro said.
   Foxx's lawyer, Paul Whitford, told the court that the sale would
conflict with the interests of the bankruptcy court. Whitford said
the issue was ``whether provisions of the bankruptcy code override
provisions of the IRS code.''
   Foxx, who filed for Chapter 11 protection from bankruptcy in
1983, owes the IRS $900,000 in back taxes, penalties and interest.
He was not at the hearing.
   The IRS in November seized more than 400 items, including his
Las Vegas home, antique cars, furniture and dozens of pieces of
jewelry.
   Foxx gained his widest audience playing a junk dealer on the
1972-77 TV series ``Sanford and Son.''

   Vocalist Tone Loc has been rapped with a
lawsuit from his cousin, who says he served as the entertainer's
manager and alleges breach of contract and fraud, according to
court records.
   Filed by Greg Jessie in county Superior Court on Thursday, it
alleges that Tone Loc denies any ``binding contractual obligation
to pay management fees.'' The lawsuit said such a contract was
signed in late 1987.
   The contract calls for Jessie to be paid 20 percent of the first
$1,000 in gross earnings and 15 percent of all other earnings,
according to the suit.
   A telephone call seeking comment at the office of Marty
Schwartz, the rap artist's personal manager, was not answered after
business hours Friday.
   Tone Loc has recorded a number of hit rap songs, including
``Wild Thing'' and ``Funky Cold Medina.'' He is earning more than
$1 million annually, Jessie's suit claims.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Dave Durenberger repaid $11,005 to
the Senate on Friday, returning money he received from the
government to make payments on a Minneapolis condominium, the
Minnesota Republican said in a statement.
   Durenberger said he was notified by the Senate Rules Committee
on Thursday that he was not entitled to the money because it was
paid from October 1983 to November 1989 at times when the Senate
was not in session.
   It was the latest bad news for Durenberger. The Senate Ethics
Committee also is investigating him for arrangements involving his
Minneapolis condominium, in addition to a book deal and
lobbyist-paid trips to Boston. He's scheduled to go before the
Ethics Committee next month.
   He has apologized to Minnesotans for what he said were mistakes
and lapses in judgement but has denied any wrongdoing.
   Two recent statewide polls show that Durenberger's popularity
has plummeted since the investigation began last year, and as many
as 76 percent of Minnesota adults want Durenberger to resign if the
Ethics Committee finds significant ethics violations.
   The senator said he asked the Rules Committee in December to
review his receiving per diem reimbursements for daily rental
payments for the Minneapolis condominium, which he uses when on
official business in Minnesota.
   The committee ruled he was not entitled to reimbursements for
daily expenses while using the condo during August recesses and
recesses between congressional sessions in the years 1983-89,
Durenberger said.
   ``This is a first-ever ruling,'' the senator said. ``In nearly
seven years of submitting these expenses for reimbursement ... I
have never been notified by either the Senate Disbursing Office or
the Senate Rules Committee audit staff that the expenses where not
reimbursable.''
   The Associated Press was unable Friday night to contact Rules
Committee staff members Friday night to confirm whether it was a
first-time ruling.
   Durenberger said he calculated that the total amount of
reimbursements received for per diem expenses during those recesses
was $11,005, and he submitted a check for that amount to the
Financial Clerk of the U.S. Senate.
   ``When there is an official determination of the amount of
interest that is due, I will also pay that,'' he said in the
statement.
   Because his condo in McLean, Va., is considered his usual place
of residence during congressional sessions, Durenberger can claim
expense reimbursement for time spent at the Minneapolis condominium
during sessions, said Carrie Collins, his press secretary.

   Many of the 250,000 listeners who tune in
to Michael Feldman's nationwide ``Whad'ya Know?'' program Saturday
mornings on American Public Radio beg to hear about his personal
life.
   But he's not talking about that anymore.
   ``Do you bother your minister or rabbi with that question?''
Feldman shot back at a caller on a recent show who asked how
Feldman spends his time when he's not on the air.
   ``When I first started, I talked about my divorce,'' said
Feldman, who said such talk was therapeutic. ``Now I figure it's
none of their business.
   ``You have to save some for yourself.''
   The 40-year-old bespectacled Feldman, known for his dry,
off-beat humor, started ``Whad'ya Know?'' in 1985 after working as
a high school English teacher and experimenting with other radio
jobs. The program has developed a loyal following. It airs on 103
stations.
   ``He's one of the most popular radio personalities on American
Public Radio,'' said Dan Jensen, APR's marketing director in St.
Paul, Minn.
   ``Whad'ya Know?'' airs before a live audience and features
music, a call-in quiz and the ``Town of the Week,'' a feature in
which a town _ chosen by throwing a dart at a map _ is critiqued.
   Serious subjects are off limits on Feldman's show. Instead, the
host prefers to ponder callers' questions like, ``If prunes are
dried plums, where does prune juice come from?'' and ``Do radio
show hosts get dressing rooms?''
   ``Not this one,'' Feldman replied to the latter query during a
recent show. ``I come dressed.''
   Feldman said he hosts the show because it's fun and he only has
to go to his Madison office twice a week.
   ``I'm very lazy,'' conceded Feldman, who spends much of his free
time researching questions for the show's quiz or just ``doing
nothing.''
   ``I hate working for a living,'' he said. ``My main concern was
doing something fun.''
   Feldman's growing popularity has earned him a chance to take his
wit, quizzes and other innovations on national television. The
Disney Channel will air four taped segments of ``Whad'ya Know?'' in
March.
   He said he presently makes ``as much money as a bad lawyer,''
but if the television debut proves succesful his salary could jump
to that of ``an average lawyer.''
   He began working odd jobs in radio in 1977 but his first big
shot came in 1984 when he was hired for a show at WGN in Chicago.
But he and his co-host clashed and both were fired.
   When the offer to host ``Whad'ya Know?'' came in 1985, Feldman
was reluctant to leave Chicago. ``I wanted to stay and get my
revenge,'' he quipped.
   But he went, and his show now is heard around the nation _
including back in Chicago, where Feldman recently did a live remote
show that drew a sellout crowd of 1,300.
   ``I'm surprised sometimes at the dedication people tell me
about,'' he said. ``I'm a little embarrassed by it all, but I'm
glad for it.''
   His show is usually aired from Madison and people sometimes
arrive two hours early to get a seat.
   ``We have enjoyed Michael Feldman's zig-zag humor for more than
10 years,'' said Sandra Larson, who has been attending Feldman's
show with her husband since the days he broadcast from the Madison
diner.
   ``He's refreshing,'' she said. ``He has that sort of boyish
charm that lets people open up.''
   Feldman doesn't spend a lot of time pondering his future.
   ``I have an internal unattainable level of success,'' he said.
``In some ways I think it's morally wrong to want to be successful.
But on the other hand, I don't want to fail because I've done that
and it's not fun.''

<HEAD>Bush to Propose $7 Billion Military Budget Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is proposing $303.3 billion for
defense in a new budget that would increase spending for the
Strategic Defense Initiative and calls for five B-2 stealth
bombers, say congressional sources and Pentagon documents.
   The budget plan, to be released formally on Monday, also would
cut military personnel by 38,000, fund two land-based nuclear
missiles and cancel a number of weapons programs, including another
attempt to scrap the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey aircraft.
   The plan would add $7 billion to the military budget, bringing
it to $303.3 billion for the 1991 fiscal year _ a 2.4 percent
increase from this year's $296.3 billion but about 2 percent less
than what the Pentagon would need to keep pace with inflation.
   The figure includes $292.1 billion for Pentagon spending, up
from $286.8 billion, with the rest representing Energy Department
spending for nuclear programs, according to documents made
available to The Associated Press Friday by congressional sources.
   Total budget authority for the military in the year beginning
Oct. 1 would be $306.9 billion, up from $301.6 billion, also
including Energy Department money.
   The budget figures come amid dramatic changes in Eastern Europe,
where nations are pushing towards democracy, and administration
officials concede the Soviet threat has lessened.
   ``This budget represents the first steps in responding to
changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, as well as tighter
budget constraints,'' Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said in
comments included in the documents.
   The budget total for SDI _ commonly known as Star Wars _ is $4.5
billion in Pentagon spending. Adding approximately $300 million in
Energy Department money, the program would get $4.8 billion.
   The total is a $1 billion increase over what Congress approved
last year and reflects ``strong support for a vigorous SDI program
that includes the `brilliant pebbles' technology for space-based
interceptors,'' the Pentagon said.
   Brilliant pebbles is a system composed of many small ground- and
space-based interceptors that would sense enemy ballistic missiles.
The interceptors would ram the missiles, causing them to explode.
   A number of Democrats in Congress question the system and favor
long-term research on directed energy weapons.
   The budget proposal also includes $5.5 billion for five B-2
bombers, the radar-evading, bat-winged aircraft that has come under
attack on Capitol Hill for its high price of about $530 million
apiece. Last year, Congress gave the Bush administration two of the
three bombers it sought and this year's total of five is certain to
be attacked.
   Another thorny issue is the administration's plan to fund two
land-based nuclear missiles _ the singled-warhead Midgetman and the
multiple-warhead MX missile. The budget proposal calls for $202
million for the Midgetman and $2.8 billion for the MX.
   Among the other high-priced, strategic programs in the budget is
$1.5 billion for one Trident submarine and $1.7 billion for 52
Trident II nuclear missiles.
   The budget also includes plans to mothball two battleships, the
USS New Jersey and the USS Iowa, and cancellations of various
weapons programs, some of which were on the chopping block last
year.
   Among the programs terminated are the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey
tilt-rotor aircraft, the Navy's F-14D jet fighter, the Phoenix and
Maverick missiles, the Apache helicopter, the Army Helicopter
Improvement Program (AHIP), the F-15E fighter and the M-1 tank.
   Congress last year rejected the administration's attempt to
eliminate the Osprey.
   The budget calls for a reduction in active troop strength by
38,000 from nearly 2.1 million and cuts in civilian forces of 5,000
and reserves by 3,000.
   At the Pentagon, a senior administration official said the
spending would represent a decline in purchasing power after
inflation is taken into account.
   ``It means that we will be able to buy fewer planes, tanks, and
ships, and support fewer troops,'' said the official, who spoke
only on condition he not be named.

Marion, and Martin.
   Also, Okeechobee, Orange, Osceola, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk,

Volusia.
   ``Everyone in Florida was affected by the freeze, some worse

it's gratifying to know that those farmers in the counties most
severly affected will get some assistance.''
   President Bush earlier declared Broward, Collier, Dade, Hendry,
Lee, Monroe and Palm Beach counties as major disaster areas due to
damage from the freezing conditions that blitzed Florida Dec. 23-25.

   The Energy Department is dropping plans to
build a plutonium refinery in Idaho that the Reagan administration
had called essential to modernizing the nuclear weapons complex,
according to department sources.
   The decision reflects the Bush administration's reconsideration
of nuclear arms priorities in light of democratic reforms in
Eastern Europe and domestic budget pressures.
   The decision to end financing for the Special Isotope Separation
plant, planned for construction at the Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory near Idaho Falls, will be part of the fiscal 1991 budget
President Bush sends to Congress Monday, according to sources who
spoke Friday on condition of anonymity.
   The plant was expected to cost at least $1.2 billion. But $400
million already has been spent on design and related work and
construction has not started.
   Just 13 months ago, in an official blueprint for modernizing the
nuclear arms production complex, the Reagan administration called
the Idaho project ``time-critical and essential.'' It was to have
been the first new atomic weapon plant since the N reactor, which
produced plutonium at the Hanford nuclear reservation near
Richland, Wash., was put into operation 27 years ago.
   The project's refining technology, which uses lasers to vaporize
plutonium so that it can be used in nuclear warheads, has been
criticized as unduly hazardous by environmental groups.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins strongly backed the Idaho
project in congressional testimony early last year but has been
reconsidering for several months.
   Phil Hamric, manager of the Energy Department's Idaho field
office, declined to confirm the decision.
   The department announced Friday, however, that it had
indefinitely postponed a series of public hearings that would form
part of the foundation for a study of the environmental impact of a
prototype for the Idaho plutonium refinery.
   The postponement, which was not explained by the department,
apparently resulted from Watkins' decision to drop the Idaho
project. Watkins had announced last year that the department would
prepare an environmental impact report on plutonium refining
experiments with the prototype, which is at Livermore, Calif.
   The hearings were to have been held Feb. 2 and 3 at Livermore
and Feb. 7 at Idaho Falls.
   On Wednesday, Sens. James McClure and Steve Symms, Republicans
of Idaho, issued a joint statement saying they expected the 1991
budget to contain no money for the project. Both were strong
supporters of the project.
   ``If what we have learned is correct, it appears that there will
be zero funding in the budget for construction'' of the plant, the
senators said, adding that they accepted the decision ``based upon
a variety of global developments and budgetary issues.''
   The Snake River Alliance, a Boise-based environmental group,
said they interpreted the Idaho senators' statement as meaning the
project was dead.
   ``We believe that construction funds for this porkbarrel relic
of the Cold War will never be seen in the federal budget again,''
said Elizabeth Paul, the group's executive director.
   In a related development Friday, the Energy Department announced
it was replacing the manager of the troubled Rocky Flats plutonium
processing plant near Denver, which has been closed since November
to review management and safety procedures.
   Watkins said Robert M. Nelson Jr., deputy manager of the
department's Nevada field office in Las Vegas, would take over at
Rocky Flats for David P. Simonson, who will move to the deputy
manager's slot there.

   Manuel Noriega must remain in jail despite his
claim that he is a prisoner of war and should be moved to a neutral
country, a judge ruled.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler's decision on Friday came
after prosecutors portrayed the fallen Panamanian ruler as a
wealthy and dangerous man with cash and armed supporters
potentially hidden around the world.
   ``Mr. Noriega is a danger to the community,'' said Deputy
Assistant U.S. Attorney Myles Malman said during the bond hearing.
``He is a military man trained and skilled in the use of
counter-terrorism, covert actions and weapons.''
   Prosecutors said the 145-year sentence Noriega could be given if
convicted of drug trafficking, coupled with his ``extraordinary
wealth,'' made it likely he would flee the country if released on
bond.
   Investigators and U.S. troops who invaded Panama found up to $30
million in Noriega assets, including homes in Panama, a condominium
in France, sports cars and bank accounts, Malman said.
   On Noriega's ranch, soldiers found envelopes marked
``Confidential for my general,'' and stuffed with $5.8 million in
cash, he said.
   But defense attorney Frank Rubino insisted the court has no
jurisdiction in Noriega's case, and refused to participate in the
bond hearing.
   ``To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time the United
States has invaded a country, toppled its government and put its
leader on trial,'' Rubino said outside the courthouse.
   Rubino told the judge that a letter from Noriega to President
Bush was delivered Friday to the White House and the State
Department claiming status as a prisoner of war under the Geneva
Convention.
   The defense contended that an international tribunal, perhaps
the World Court at The Hague or Geneva, must automatically be
invoked by Noriega's alleged POW status.
   Hoeveler did not consider the motion immediately.
   Prosecutors emphasized Noriega's alleged dark side in their
effort to keep him in jail, saying he was known for torturing
opponents and personally ordered the execution of the leader of the
failed October coup attempt against him.
   They also said soldiers found the names of the four people on a
sheet of paper in Noriega's Fort Amador office, which contained so
much black magic paraphernalia U.S. soldiers called it the ``Witch
House.''
   Malman implied that the list was part of a curse against the
four men _ the judge himself; U.S. Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh; Charles Saphos, head of the Justice Department's drug
section; and Mark Schnapp, a former Miami federal prosecutor who
helped bring about the Noriega indictment.
   ``Maybe I better not enter it into evidence,'' the judge joked.
   Malman said Noriega, 51, has a $400,000 condominum in Paris and
a $500,000 three-story home in Panama. The prosecution introduced
photos of deposit slips showing that Noriega's 17-year-old daughter
deposited $1.3 million in Panamanian banks in September 1989.
   The U.S. government also has frozen $20 million in Noriega
assets scattered in bank accounts. The prosecution maintained that
Noriega also transferred about $19 million from an account in
London to one in Luxembourg after the indictment was unsealed. It
was unclear whether the deposits and seizures were duplicated in
the prosecution's listings.
   In addition to those sums, Noriega was said to have friends in
countries at odds with the United States, including Cuba and Libya.
He noted that Moammar Gadhafi had presented Noriega with ``his and
hers Gadhafi watches.''
   Asked by Hoeveler at the end of the session if he wished to
rebut prosecution arguments, Rubino replied by reciting Noriega's
name, rank and serial number _ 0001.

   Sir Arthur Slug, a bulldog with a bent
for betting, has picked the Denver Broncos over the San Francisco
49ers in Sunday's Super Bowl.
   Slug's predictions are nothing to sniff at, according to owner
Frank Dunn. The 100-pound oddsmaker was right 18 games out of 23
Dunn had his dog call this season.
   ``I write the name of each team playing on a separate piece of
paper. Then I put dog food on both pieces of paper,'' said Dunn,
40, a part-time bartender who lives in this Pittsburgh suburb.
   ``Whichever one he eats off of is the team I bet on. Of course,
I have to grab the other pile of dog food real fast before he eats
both of them.''
   Dunn said he seeks his pet's advice only on professional
football games because he doesn't want the 2-year-old Slug to turn
into a compulsive gambler.
   ``I guess one of the reasons he's so smart is that he's
pedigreed. He cost me $700, but I've been winning all that back,''
Dunn said.

   Jackaroos and Jillaroos who are fair dinkum
are sidling up to Elko's billabongs trying their hands at being
spruikers instead of ringers and drovers.
   That's the Australian version of events at the sixth annual
Cowboy Poetry Gathering that winds up today in this town between
Reno and Salt Lake City.
   What the Aussies mean is that male and female ranch hands who
are the real thing are going to Elko watering holes to become
reciters of poetry instead of cowboys.
   Six balladeers from Down Under joined some 70 American cowboy
poets from 16 Western states in this year's celebration of poetry
readings.
   Cowboy poetry was spawned around nighttime campfires on the open
range.
   ``I think people will be surprised to find (Australians)
basically have a parallel tradition to our cowboy poetry
tradition,'' said Hal Cannon, co-founder of the Elko event. ``They
have a similar stockman tradition and their history of settling the
Outback is similar to our settling the West.''
   Elko declared Friday Australia Day in honor of the first
European settlers who landed in Sydney on Jan. 26, 1788.
   In celebration, the Elko High School band played ``The Star
Spangled Banner'' and a version of Australia's national song,
``Waltzing Matilda,'' written by bush poet Andrew Barton ``Banjo''
Patterson.
   More than 7,000 people were expected to visit Elko, population
25,000, through the weekend to hear the lyrical tales.

<HEAD>After More Than Half a Century, Hawkins Calls End to Era</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, one of the last New
Deal-era liberal Democrats still in office, is retiring after
pressing to help the needy during his 27 years in Congress.
   ``Maybe I can do a better job calling attention to my concerns
on the outside than on the inside,'' the 82-year-old chairman of
the House Education and Labor Committee said in an interview after
announcing he would not seek re-election next November.
   Hawkins, the longest-serving black in Congress, said he made the
decision Thursday night with his wife and did not consult with
party leaders before making the announcement Friday.
   He said he considered retiring before but ``there was always
another project, another bill I wanted to see passed, so I just
kept going on.''
   Hawkins has represented the primarily black and Hispanic Watts
area of Los Angeles and surrounding Hispanic suburbs since 1963,
when he became the first black elected to Congress from California.
Before that he had been a member of the state legislature since
1934.
   In 1984, he replaced the late Rep. Carl D. Perkins, D-Ky., as
chairman of the education and labor panel. His most likely
successor as the panel's chairman is Rep. William D. Ford, D-Mich.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who chairs the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee, called Hawkins ``a tireless champion of
a better and fairer America.''
   ``Few, if any, members of Congress have done more over the past
quarter century to fulfill the nation's commitment to those who
need our help the most,'' Kennedy said.
   Narrowing the disparity between rich and poor has always been
the focus of Hawkins' agenda.
   A year after entering Congress, he co-authored the 1964 Civil
Rights Act's Title VII, which created the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission and mandated fair employment practices.
   In 1978 he was the co-author with the late Sen. Hubert Humphrey
of the Humphrey-Hawkins full employment bill, which officially
targets an unemployment rate of 4 percent as the nation's goal.
   But for most of the past decade, Hawkins was forced into a role
of tilting at windmills as a critic of the so-called Reagan
Revolution.
   The adamant liberal with a 100 percent favorable voting record
from the AFL-CIO six of the past eight years has often taken a
pragmatic approach in forging alliances with conservatives to
advance his agenda.
   In 1982, he worked with Dan Quayle, then a conservative
Republican senator from Indiana, and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, to
assure unions and community activist groups a voice in allocating
wage subsidies to businesses under the Job Training Partnership Act.
   ``I never tried to play the role of superstar, that's just not
my nature,'' Hawkins said Friday. ``My approach has always been to
get some tangible results. You can't let your ego stand in the
way.''
   Last year, he and Hatch joined to emphasize early, school-based
education for 3- and 4-year-olds as part of a multibillion-dollar
child care bill that remains stymied because of opposition from
Bush and conservative Democrats.
   Hawkins said he fears a compromise may produce ``two systems,
one in which the poor will go to inferior care facilities and the
wealthy will be able to take care of their own children.''
   Hawkins complained that Bush, while touting himself as the
``education president,'' has consistently opposed appropriating the
money needed to carry out an $8.3 billion school improvement act
that Hawkins wrote and former President Reagan signed two years ago.
   ``It's the same old story: There's just no money,'' he said.
``If we only implemented that law as it should be, education would
be at the top of the agenda. Instead, we're moving in just the
opposite direction, fooling around with fads.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Decry Bush Plan on VA Home Loans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The chairmen of the two congressional
committees that oversee veterans affairs say they will fight a Bush
administration proposal to require down payments on veterans home
loans.
   ``I'm not going to buy that,'' Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery,
chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee said when details
of the proposal were disclosed Friday in advance of President
Bush's release of the fiscal 1991 budget.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate veterans'
panel, added he would ``strongly oppose all changes in the
fundamental nature of this important veterans benefit.''
   The lawmakers applauded, however, the administration's request
to boost health care spending for veterans to $12.3 billion. Health
care is the most expensive service provided to the nation's 27
million veterans, especially as that population ages.
   The budget, details of which were obtained in advance of the
formal Monday presentation to Congress, will propose $31 billion
overall spending for the Department of Veterans' Affairs in the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   The appropriation for this fiscal year totaled $11.5 billion for
health care, $743 million more than President had asked for.
   The budget supports a health care staff of nearly 195,000.
   The down payment proposal would cover loans of more than
$25,000, essentially all new loans since the average under the
program is $70,000. The $25,000 loans generally are made for home
improvements.
   According to the veterans department, 178,000 guaranteed loans
will be closed in this fiscal year. VA borrowers may make a form of
``down payment'' in order to bring the loan down to an amount they
can afford, or if the home purchase should exceed $184,000.
   According to Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the
Mortgage Bankers Association of America, 70 percent of VA loans
have no down payment. Lasko said the proposal is part of an attempt
that began in the Reagan administration to ``throttle'' the
program, but the down payment proposal is a ``new wrinkle.''
   ``If the 4 percent proposed down payment to the VA home loan
above $25,000 is part of the budget, it represents a drastic change
in the very concept and intent of the 45-year-old VA home loan
program,'' said Larry W. Rivers, executive director of the Veterans
of Foreign Wars.
   He called it an ``unreasonable, an unfair proposal, which dashes
the dreams of countless veterans of participating in the American
dream of home ownership.''
   Lasko said he was equally disturbed by a proposal to raise the
mortgage indemnity fund fee for borrowers to 1.75 percent of the
mortgage from 1.25 percent. That fee, which took effect this month
to provide a new fund to insure against bad mortgages, replaces a 1
percent borrowers fee that went to the VA.
   ``It's a standard user fee story'' comparable to the Social
Security, airport and highway trust funds, Lasko said. Critics say
the government uses those funds to finance the deficit.
   Veterans organizations were not happy with the health care
increase, arguing $13.4 billion is needed to keep services in line
with 1988 levels.
   But Cranston and Montgomery were satisfied.
   Montgomery said the proposal for health care funding was ``fair
and realistic'' and ``one of the best we've seen in years.''

<TEXT>
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos is trying to
put aside rumors of his imminent departure, declaring ``I'm the
right person for the job.''
   ``Never once, never once has the president expressed
dissatisfaction at the way I'm doing my job or the quality of work
that is coming out of this department,'' Cavazos said Friday. ``The
day the president says, `Pack it up, it's done,' I'll say, `Yes,
Mr. President.'''
   The education secretary said in an interview with the cable
television network The Learning Channel that he was disappointed by
criticism about his low-key management style and his distaste for
publicity.
   ``If this secretary of education can move this nation into
thinking about what it must do in the coming decade about
education, what difference does it make whether you have someone
who shouts, yells, screams and tears their shirt?'' Cavazos said.
   ``I expect them to understand what I'm saying rather than
worrying about style. Style gets you nowhere. If shouting and
carrying on is what they want, they got the wrong person for the
job, ...'' he said. ``But I know I'm the right person for this
job.''
   Criticism of Cavazos focuses on his unwillingness to argue for
raising federal education spending and to use his office as a
``bully pulpit,'' as did his flamboyant predecessor, William
Bennett.
   Since his first day in office, Cavazos' professorial style,
which he said evolved through many years as dean of a medical
school and president of Texas Tech University, has been compared
with that of Bennett.
   Cavazos said improving America's schools is a massive project
that includes giving parents a choice of where to send their
children to school, allowing local officials to manage their own
affairs and using alternative methods to certify some teachers.
   ``In order to bring this about it means a total restructuring of
the educational process,'' said Cavazos.

<HEAD>Daily News, Unions Gear Up for Contract Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The picture at New York's Picture Newspaper is
not pretty _ a cost-cutting management is set to take on the unions
in negotiations that could decide the fate of the Daily News.
   Contracts with the paper's 10 unions expire March 30. Despite
protests from the unions that they have no intention to strike,
News executives have done little to hide their extensive
preparations to handle a walkout.
   John T. Sloan, the News' vice president of human resources,
called it ``the most critical negotiations in our history.''
   ``The fundamental issue in these contract negotiations revolves
around the survival of the New York Daily News ... because over the
last 10 years we have lost over $115 million in over $4 billion in
revenue,'' he said.
   Sloan said the paper wants to cut ``labor abuses that exist in
our contracts,'' and has submitted proposals to two unions that
would cut manpower, reduce insurance coverage, freeze wages, remove
foremen from the union and eliminate seniority rights except for
vacations.
   The unions are placing equal emphasis on the negotiations.
Theodore Kheel, the unions' adviser, said it was of ``critical
importance ... to the whole labor movement.''
   The unions have been unreceptive to Daily News proposals.
   ``If they need relief, let them come up to the bargaining tables
like men and say to us where they need the relief,'' said Michael
Alvino, president of the Newspaper and Mail Delivers union. ``If
there's waste, let them prove where the waste is.''
   Both sides acknowledge that the Daily News, founded in 1919,
needs to replace aging machinery with automated equipment and color
presses.
   Both sides know that the News _ which still sells more
newspapers than any other locally circulated, general interest
newspaper in America _ has lost readers. The News once sold more
than 2 million papers a day; it now sells 1.2 million weekdays and
1.4 million on Sundays.
   Analysts say the three-tabloid city _ the New York Post and New
York Newsday are the other two _ can support only one or two.
   And both labor and management know that advertising is harder to
come by as many of the city's big department stores closed in
recent years.
   The concord ends there.
   The unions claim the real goal of the News' Chicago-based
parent, the Tribune Co., is to sell the paper _ something it tried
to do in 1982 _ or fold it. News officials deny it.
   The News said it wants to spend $300 million to $500 million on
plants and equipment to replace machinery more than 30 years old.
   But labor leaders say the company already has reneged on a 1987
promise that if the unions made concessions of $30 million, it
would invest $300 million in plants and presses. Sloan said that
pledge was never made.
   The two sides even dispute whether the newspaper is losing money.
   Edward Atorino, an analyst for Salomon Brothers, said the News
has made a marginal profit of a few million dollars in recent
years. But he said that is not enough: the News must streamline its
operations, build a new plant and get rid of inefficiencies in its
labor contracts.
   ``Before the Tribune Co. starts writing some checks, they want
to get a return for their money. Otherwise, they will keep it in
the bank,'' he said.
   ``If you look at the last two or three years, the newspaper
business has had very good economic periods and many newspapers
have made a lot of money. The News hasn't. Why? Because the costs
are too high.''
   Management's preparation for strife includes the hiring of two
law firms that unions regard as union busters. The News also has
put up reinforced glass, blocked off its composing room with a
doorway and issued new card keys to employees that limit their
access to areas they once could enter freely.
   The newspaper bought 22 acres in North Bergen, N.J., and said it
intended to use it and 39 acres in Syosset, N.Y., for future
expansion.
   But the unions say buildings on the New Jersey acreage have been
used to train people on News machinery and would serve as a barbed
wire-enclosed enclave protecting a makeshift newsroom during the
strike. The News acknowledged that training has taken place there,
but said no more.
   The News' success in weathering a strike would depend on whether
deliverers worked; despite an enticing News proposal that would
make the drivers into independent operators who could make up to
$250,000 a year, drivers leader Alvino insisted that ``my union
will stick.''
   ``The New York Daily News wants a strike and we have no
intentions of getting suckered into that,'' Alvino said. ``We will
negotiate, negotiate, negotiate. We have no intentions of putting
our people in the streets.''

<HEAD>Judge OKs Drug Testing for 19 White House Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has lifted a ban on drug
testing for 19 employees in the Executive Office of the President
who have ``top secret'' security clearances, but has continued to
bar the tests for 10 others with ``secret'' clearances.
   The employees have filed a lawsuit challenging random, mandatory
urinalysis called for by Bush administration officials, who declare
that the employees hold sensitive positions and should be tested.
The employees are in the Office of Management and Budget, the
Office of Administration and the Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative.
   U.S. District Court Judge Louis Oberdorfer said Friday that it
is ``unlikely'' that those with top secret clearances will prevail
in the case, although he allowed that portion of the lawsuit to
proceed.
   The judge said ``the permissibility of subjecting'' the 10
others to drug tests ``is less clear'' and he kept the ban in place.
   The government contends, in effect, that information classified
as secret is by definition as truly sensitive as top secret
information, noted the judge.
   A 1982 executive order draws the distinction between top secret
and secret information by saying that disclosure of the former
could reasonably be expected to cause ``exceptionally grave
damage'' to the national security. Disclosure of secret information
could reasonably be expected to cause ``serious'' damage, says the
executive order.

<HEAD>Ex-Sperry Executive Sentenced to 60 Days in Halfway House</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former Sperry Corp. marketing executive who
admitted initiating a scheme to bribe a Navy procurement official
has been sentenced to 60 days in a halfway house.
   Frank J. Lavelle, 69, of Dunedin, Fla., was sentenced Friday in
U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va., on his guilty plea to
conspiracy to defraud the government and commit bribery of a public
official.
   U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton gave Lavelle a two-year
sentence, before suspending all but 60 days and ordering the
defendant to serve that period in a halfway house.
   Lavelle, former marketing director of Sperry Corp.'s Clearwater,
Fla., facility, could have received a 20-year prison term for
initiating the scheme to bribe Navy procurement officer Garland L.
Tomlin Jr.
   Lavelle, who pleaded guilty Oct. 20, has agreed to cooperate
with the Justice Department's investigation of Pentagon procurement
fraud code-named ``Operation Ill Wind.''
   Lavelle admitted that he introduced Tomlin to Sperry Corp. vice
president Charles F. Gardner, telling Gardner that Tomlin wanted a
``nest egg'' for his retirement.
   Tomlin has pleaded guilty to accepting $400,000 in bribes from
Sperry, which later merged with Burroughs Corp. to become Unisys
Corp., and $75,000 from Honeywell Inc. in exchange for confidential
bid information.

   The government is recalling three million cans
of an aerosol string confetti because the propellant used in the
product may be highly flammable.
   The product, ``Extra Thick Super String,'' often used at
children's birthday parties and other celebrations, is hazardous if
sprayed near an open flame, the Consumer Product Safety Commission
said Friday.
   The commission received reports on consumer hotlines that six
children were burned when fires started after the string was
sprayed in the area of birthday cakes with candles, said CPSC
spokesman Ken Giles.
   Approximately three million cans of the string were sold
nationwide from December 1988 until October 1989, when the New
Jersey-based manufacturer, E. Davis, Inc., developed a new
inflammable propellant formula, the agency said in a written
statement.
   Consumers should discard any pre-October cans of the product and
mail the each orange, blue, pink or green plastic can cap to the
company for two replacements with the reformulated items.

   Gubernatorial candidate John Silber said he will
not apologize for remarks he made about immigrants to Massachusetts
that his opponents and other state officials have labeled as racist.
   ``I think anyone who raised the suggestion that I was either
hostile to immigrants or in any sense a racist definitely owes me
an apology,'' Silber said Friday, adding his father was a German
immigrant.
   Asked if he owed anyone an apology, Silber said: ``Certainly
not.''
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis called Silber's comments about
immigrants to the state offensive and pressed him to apologize.
   And two of Silber's Democratic opponents, state Rep. John Flood
and Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy, renewed their criticism Friday after
expressions of outrage the day before.
   ``It is insidious to make unfair and unwarranted generalized or
stereotypical comments, especially at a time when Massachusetts is
engaged in the delicate task of restoring racial harmony,'' Flood
said.
   ``I would have hoped he could have found an apology today,''
Murphy said. ``I was offended. I think he ought to be reflecting on
all this long and hard.''
   Silber, the president of Boston University, called the news
conference Friday after controversy arose from an interview
published in the Telegram &amp; Gazette of Worcester in which he
questioned whether the state has become a ``welfare magnet.''
   ``Why has Massachusetts suddenly become so popular for people
who are accustomed to living in the tropical climate?'' Silber told
the newspaper.
   He also told the newspaper, ``Why should Lowell be the Cambodian
capital of America? It is extraordinary. Why should they all be
concentrated in one place? This needs to be examined.''
   At the news conference Silber said: ``Opponents have taken my
remarks out of context and twisted them beyond recognition. Some
have even suggested that I am racist and hostile to immigrants.
Like Sen. Joseph McCarthy, who smeared his opponents with the
charge of communism, they have attempted to smear me with the
charge of racism.''
   But he did not back away from his views that some people come to
Massachusetts to collect welfare.
   ``Some come because of the accessibility and elevation of
welfare payments. That is not a criticism. That is a description,''
Silber said. ``Sometimes we have to look at the facts. People who
want to avoid the facts are not going to solve the problems of
Massachusetts.''
   In addition, he accused the news media of poor reporting.
   ``People ought to know the distortion of reporting is so great
they would be well advised to hold their piece until they could get
a complete transcript of what one is alleged to have said,'' he
said.

   Although he's considered a longshot for
winning his party's gubernatorial nomination, Miami Democrat Alcee
Hastings is willing to bet the state is ready to legalize casino
gambling.
   Hastings _ a Miami attorney who became Florida's first black
U.S. district judge, only to be impeached by the U.S. Senate last
year _ said Friday he favors changing the Florida Constitution to
allow casino gambling with profits helping the state meet its
growth needs.
   Similar efforts to legalize casino gambling failed in 1978 and
1986.
   ``It's a new idea, one that will at least meet with some
resistance, but I believe with some favorable responses as well,''
said Hastings.
   One of those resisting is U.S. Rep. Bill Nelson, one of three
Democratic gubernatorial hopefuls.
   ``You look at the other states that have horse racing and then
you look at the states that have casino gambling, and there's a
distinct attitude, atmosphere and element that is attracted to
casino gambling that I don't think fits the family-oriented, high
technology-oriented, business-oriented atmosphere of our state,''
Nelson said Friday.
   Hastings' plan would locate casinos in 10 regions of the state,
blocking out only a three-county area around Walt Disney World
because of its reputation as a family recreational center.
   ``We have serious revenue needs,'' said Hastings, who will seek
his party's nomination in a Sept. 4 primary against Nelson and
state Sen. George Stuart.
   He said half of the casino profits would go to education with
the other half split between crime prevention and general revenue.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti's military ruler, Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril, says he is lifting a 30-day state of siege under
which security forces rounded up dozens of political activists and
forced at least seven into exile.
   In a speech Friday night carried live on state radio and
television, Avril said the state of siege would be withdrawn
Tuesday _ 18 days early _ ``in view of the positive results already
obtained.''
   It was unclear whether Avril was bowing to diplomatic pressure
or simply felt he had effectively stifled open opposition to his
16-month-old regime.
   The announcement came the same day the French government said it
was suspending economic assistance and talks on a $500 million aid
package for Haiti, one of the world's poorest nations, to protest
Avril's crackdown on his political opponents.
   The 12-nation European Economic Community also issued a strongly
worded protest Friday.
   Avril has also been under pressure from the Bush administration,
which denounced the state of siege as a ``blatant assault on basic
civil liberties.'' The United States suspended $60 milion in annual
direct aid to Haiti after an election massacre in 1987.
   In his speech, Avril did not say whether the seven exiled
opposition leaders would be allowed to return. However, the
interior and defense minister, Brig. Gen. Fritz Romulus, said
earlier in the week that the seven could take part in elections
scheduled for next fall.
   Avril also did not say whether censorship imposed on independent
radio and television stations would be lifted along with the siege
declaration.
   The military leader, wearing his uniform and sitting at his desk
at the National Palace, addressed the nation before the start of
the 10 p.m. news on state TV. He read from a prepared text in
French, rather than Creole, the language of 90 percent of Haiti's
5.7 million people.
   The state of siege was imposed on Jan. 20, one day after
unidentified gunmen killed army Col. Andre Neptune, his wife and
their housemaid.
   Avril, who attended Neptune's funeral Friday, blamed the
assassination on unspecified ``terrorists'' and ``anarchists.'' In
apparent reference to the exiled opposition leaders, Avril said
``political demagogues'' had helped create a climate of insecurity
in the country.
   Among the politicians forced into exile were Dr. Louis Roy, one
of the main authors of the 1987 constitution, and Hubert De
Ronceray, a prominent conservative and former presidential
candidate.
   They were among an estimated 50 activists arrested and
reportedly beaten in the military sweep last weekend.
   Although he did not acknowledge mistreatment by the military,
Avril said the ``furor of the soldiers'' after Neptune's killing
was understandable.
   He said the security forces had been hamstrung by certain
constitutional guarantees, such as a 48-hour limit on holding
suspects without bringing charges.
   Extraordinary measures were necessary, Avril said, ``to
safeguard our young, tottering, stammering democracy.''
   Critics have accused Avril of using the colonel's assassination
as a pretext to suppress opposition and renege on his pledge to
turn over power to a democratically elected government. Elections
are scheduled for Oct. 28.
   But Avril reiterated his pledge to hold elections.
   ``The democratic process will not be put into question,'' he
said. ``On the contrary, in a more serene climate, the electoral
machine will advance more securely.''
   Avril gained power in September 1988 when a soldiers' rebellion
ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who took over after a popular
uprising forced dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier to flee to France in
February 1986.
   The last time Haiti attempted free elections, in November 1987,
armed thugs in collusion with government troops shot or hacked to
death at least 34 voters and the balloting was canceled.

   After waiting more than a year, William
and Aleta Heidt were ecstatic to learn last week that their plans
to adopt two children from Colombia had finally been approved.
   But the joyous anticipation turned into hours of hellish
desperation for Mrs. Heidt when Avianca Flight 52 crashed with her
husband and new son and daughter aboard.
   Mrs. Heidt of Wyckoff, N.J., went to John F. Kennedy
International Airport on Thursday night carrying two small parkas _
blue and purple _ for her new children and a camera to take their
pictures.
   The adoptions had taken more than a year to set up and she knew
her son and daughter _ Blanca Beltron, 12, and her brother Pedro,
10 _ only from a snapshot.
   But Avianca Flight 52 never arrived and Friday morning, after a
night of telephone calls, Mrs. Heidt learned that her husband and
the children were being treated for serious injuries of three
separate hospitals.
   Her husband, William, 51, was in critical condition early today
at Nassau County Medical Center. Blanca was moved out of intensive
care and was reported in stable condition at Glen Cove Hospital.
Pedro was in stable condition at North Shore University Hospital.
   Adoption agency officials say Blanca and Pedro may have been
among many adoptive children aboard the plane.
   Changes in Colombian law that took effect Jan. 20 have made
adoption more difficult, and there has been a rush among adoptive
parents in the past week to adopt children there and bring them
home.
   ``All the orphanages are rushing people through,'' said Cheryl
Simon, a leader of the Latin American Parents Association, a group
that helps people adopting Latin-American children. ``We have 15
families down there now, due to a combination of new adoption laws
and courts opening up after Christmas break.''
   Hospitals reported treating at least 25 injured children among
the 89 people who were injured aboard the Avianca plane. It was not
clear how many of those children might have been adopted, however.
   Mrs. Heidt, eyes ringed by streaked mascara and clutching a
silver crucifix, said her husband had flown to Colombia on Sunday
after they met the Jan. 20 deadline with help from U.S. Rep. Marge
Roukema, in whose district they live.
   ``I'm self-employed and we couldn't afford to take the time,''
Mrs. Heidt said. ``He went and took vacation from work.''
   Numbed and distracted, Mrs. Heidt retreated into silence.
   ``When he's up and healthy and I see his beautiful brown eyes,
then I'll feel like talking,'' she said.
   ``She was so excited. She has their room ready. She left the
Christmas tree up and everything,'' said Lucy Ferguson, a
Travelers' Aid director who befriended Mrs. Heidt at the airport
during the desperate hours following the crash.
   Ms. Roukema called the air disaster ``an ultimate irony'' for
the Heidts.
   ``They have worked so hard over the past year to get these
children here. Now to have this tragedy is just unbelievable
irony.''

   The coalition government has announced
that parliamentary elections will be held April 8, ending an
administration that united leftists and conservatives in an uneasy
partnership.
   Friday's announcement came after a meeting of the heads of the
conservative, socialist and Communist parties with Premier Xenophon
Zolotas. It did not mention whether a caretaker government would
oversee the vote.
   The three parties put aside their differences in November to
form a temporary goverment and avoid calling immediate new
elections after inconclusive national voting June 18 and Nov. 5.
   Constantine Mitsotakis, leader of the conservative New Democracy
party, insisted that the coalition be short-lived, saying it could
not cope with the pressing economic and foreign policy issues
facing the country.
   The socialists and Communists wanted a longer-term government,
but they were unable to muster a parliamentary majority without the
conservatives.
   The government is struggling with 14.8 percent annual inflation
and a budget deficit estimated at $1.6 billion for 1989.
   The political deadlock developed when the socialists, after
eight years in office, lost the election June 18 amid charges that
Premier Andreas Papandreou and senior ministers were involved in
financial and wiretapping scandals.
   Papandreou has been indicted in connection with the scandals,
but no trial date has been set.

   The military, police and other armed
units will no longer be under the control of the Communist Party,
the government and the army announced.
   The announcement Friday on national television appeared to be an
effort by the Communists, who still control the goverment, to
bolster their sagging image before a key party congress starting
Jan. 30.
   On Thursday night, the policy-making Central Committee approved
a platform for the congress that commits the Communists to
pluralism and social democracy, the official BTA news agency said.
   A showdown is expected at the upcoming congress between
reformers and more orthodox Communists, many of whom kept the
powerful local posts they gained under former leader Todor Zhivkov,
who was ousted Nov. 10 and replaced by party leaader Petar Mladenov.
   A 12-party coalition of opposition groups, the Union of
Democratic Forces, is negotiating with the Communists for a greater
share of power.
   On Friday, BTA quoted the union's chairman, Zhelyo Zhelev, as
holding out the possibility his alliance would enter a coalition
with the Communists, but only if it were made clear the union did
not share responsibility for past mistakes under Communist rule.
   ``We do not want to share responsibility with people who are
guilty,'' Zhelev told BTA.
   According to a decree made public Friday, no political parties
will be allowed to operate in the future in the army and in
subdivisions of the Interior Ministry, including the police.
   In practice, that means abolition of Communist Party control,
because it has been the only party allowed to function in those
organizations.
   The decree by the State Council _ Bulgaria's collective
presidency _ made clear that individuals in the army and police
force may continue membership in the party ``at their place of
residence.''
   Defense Ministry spokesman Radnyu Minchev disclosed under a
resolution of the party's eight-member Politburo, dated Wednesday,
all Communist political organs and Komsomol, or Communist Youth
organizations, are being abolished in the army.
   ``This is proof of the party's renunciation of its monopoly on
power,'' he declared.
   Minchev said that under an emerging multiparty system, ``it is
inadmissible to wage a political fight within the army. ''
   Lyuben Gotsev, first deputy interior minister, said all
committees and organizations of the Communist Party and Komsomol
that are under his ministry's control will be dissolved, such as
the police, border troops and fire departments.
   Also Friday, a one-week strike of virtually all Bulgarian mines
was suspended pending negotiations involving the official trade
unions, the independent union Podkrepa and mining management.
   The TV report on the suspension did not say how many miners
struck, but noted that 14 strike committees joined in the protest
for higher pay, better retirement terms and greater safety on the
job.
   Numerous strikes have increased social tensions in this Balkan
nation as it moves toward democracy.

   Doctors operating on a survivor of the
Avianca airline crash made an unexpected find as they worked to
stop his internal bleeding _ several condoms filled with a white
powder believed to be cocaine.
   The chief of special surgery at North Shore University Hospital,
Dr. Robert Ward, said physicians operating on the man Friday found
what he estimated to be more than a pound of the drug inside the
victim's bowels.
   The flight from Bogota stopped in the drug-smuggling capital of
Medellin before continuing on to New York. The plane crashed
Thursday night in Cove Neck, killing 72 of the 161 people on board.
   The man, identified only as passenger No. 7, was in critical
condition, but was expected to survive. He suffered broken legs and
internal injuries, the doctor said.
   Police went to the victim's bedside to question him, Ward said.
   After the surgery, when doctors told the middle-aged man ``we
have to know what this is,'' the patient admitted it was cocaine,
Ward said.
   Ward removed four drug-filled condoms from the man's bowels and
believed more remained inside him, he said. Each, he said,
contained enough cocaine to kill the man, had one ruptured.
   The doctor said it would be dangerous to remove the remaining
condoms, adding that he hoped nature would take its course and the
man would discharge them with a week or so.

   Three suspected communists today shot
and killed one of President Corazon Aquino's guards, then ran over
and dragged his body for about 100 yards before escaping, police
said.
   Sgt. Sadiri Cadsap, 39, assigned to Mrs. Aquino's ceremonial and
escort company, died from multiple gunshot wounds, said Michael
Tambawan, a police investigator.
   He said the ambush took place along a busy street in Pasay City,
a Manila suburb, while the guard was waiting for a ride to work.
   Tambawan said communist New People's Army assassins walked up
slowly from behind and shot the soldier several times in the head
and back at point-blank range, killing him instantly.
   One of the gunmen then flagged down a passenger jeep, ordered
the driver and his wife to get out, then drove over Cadsap's body,
dragging it for about 100 yards before escaping, Tambawan added.
   He said the jeep was recovered in Quezon City.
   The communists are waging a 21-year-old insurgency against the
national government.

   The crew of a Colombian jetliner was
worried about running low on fuel just before the plane crashed,
killing 72 people, federal investigators say.
   National Safety Board member Lee Dickinson told a news
conference Friday that the crew, on a voice recorder recovered from
the wreckage, expressed concern several times about fuel levels
after an aborted landing attempt.
   But the pilot did not declare an emergency landing priority that
would have required controllers to immediately clear Avianca
Airlines Flight 52 for a landing Thursday night, he said.
   Although many clues indicate the plane had little or no fuel
when it crashed into a hill on the north shore of Long Island,
federal investigators would not say that the crash was caused by
the plane running out of fuel.
   No homes were hit and there were no casualties on the ground,
though one part of the plane came to rest on a home's patio.
Dickinson said 89 people survived the crash.
   Investigators picking through the wreckage of the Boeing 707 in
the woods of the isolated, wealthy suburb of Cove Neck said the
fuel gauges indicated the jet had 10,000 pounds, or 1,500 gallons,
of fuel, Dickinson said. Investigators had not yet checked the
tanks.
   Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble in Seattle said that could have
been enough fuel to fly the jet from the crash site to its
destination, Kennedy International Airport, ``but not much more.''
The airport is about 15 miles away.
   The flight from Bogota tried to land in fog and rain at 9:24
p.m., but aborted the attempt because of electronic warnings that
the plane was sinking too fast and approaching at an improper
angle, Dickinson said.
   The crew asked the airport's traffic controller for permission
to try again.
   ``They said they ... were running out of fuel or they were low
on fuel,'' Dickinson said.
   The tower gave directions; the crew repeated that the plane was
running low on fuel. The crew then reported two engines out.
   The jet disappeared from the radar screens at 9:34 p.m., he said.
   The Colombian radio network RCN has reported that the
23-year-old plane had been sent to the maintenance shop 37 times in
the past four months. Dickinson said he had no information to
confirm the plane's maintenance record.
   More than 12 hospitals worked Friday to treat survivors. At
least 25 of the injured survivors were either in serious or
critical condition, and more than two dozen children were among the
injured.
   Dickinson said only nine of the dead had been identified. Only
one member of the crew, the chief steward, survived the crash.
   Survivors said the plane circled for more than hour before the
crash.
   NBC News reported that the plane ran into delays along the East
Coast and was put in a holding pattern over Norfolk, Va., and twice
over New Jersey for 75 minutes. Dickinson and a FAA spokeswoman
said they could not confirm that.
   One passenger, Colombian businessman Jorge Lozano, said there
was no warning before the crash.
   ``I had time to say a prayer. ... In about five seconds we were
crashing into the trees,'' said Lozano, who suffered a cracked
spine.
   Scores of emergency workers from as far away as New York City
laid ladders up the steep wooded hillside where part of the
fuselage came to rest, then passed survivors down.
   ``What a way to come to America,'' one of the passengers told
rescue worker Jay Krul, 30, of Oyster Bay.
   Several factors show the plane may have run out of fuel: no fire
on impact; the low-speed landing; the lack of fuel odor; and the
angle of the nose, wings and body, which came down level instead of
thrusting forward, as they would have if the engines were running.
   Among the injured were a number of children who were bound for
adoption in the United States.
   ``A lot of the kids we got out alive,'' said rescuer Charles
Harris.
   The crash occurred a quarter-mile from the home where the
parents of tennis pro John McEnroe live; their lawn was used as a
makeshift morgue.
   Dickinson said there was no evidence thus far of sabotage.
   One victim of Thursday's crash appeared to have a cocaine
connection, however. Daniel Rossett, a spokesman for North Shore
University Hospital, said surgeons at work on a 30-year-old victim
who suffered abdominal injuries found condoms believed packed with
cocaine in the man's intestines.
   The man was in critical condition.

<HEAD>Judge: Begging a Form of Free Speech</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A no-begging rule in the subway is
unconstitutional because the First Amendment applies to panhandling
as much as any other form of speech, a federal judge declared.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand invalidated regulations of the
Transit Authority, which runs the subways, and the Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey, which prohibits begging in the World
Trade Center and the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
   He ruled Friday that the bans should be rewritten to include
``reasonable time, place and manner restrictions.''
   The authorities can forbid begging on moving vehicles and near
token booths, narrow platforms and on stairs and escalators, Sand
said.
   ``It is the total prohibition of all begging on all of the
defendants' facilities which is constitutionally impermissible,''
he said.
   The lawsuit was brought by two homeless men who beg in the
city's subway system. Their lawyer, George Summers, said the ruling
was the first time a federal court had determined that begging is
protected by the First Amendment.
   Summers had argued that begging is nothing more than one person
asking another a question. The judge adopted that approach. Sand
wrote:
   ``The simple request for money by a beggar or a panhandler
cannot but remind the passer-by that people in the city live in
poverty and often lack the essentials for survival.
   ``Even the beggar sitting in Grand Central Station with a tin
cup at his feet conveys the message that he and others like him are
in need. While often disturbing and sometimes alarmingly graphic,
begging is unmistakably informative and persuasive speech.''
   Douglas Lasdon, an attorney with the Legal Action Center for the
Homeless, said the judge's ruling ``reaffirms the principle that in
this country you cannot solve a social problem by silencing poor
people.''
   Sand's ruling stemmed from a class-action lawsuit filed Nov. 28
by Lasdon's group on behalf of homeless and needy people.
   Spokeswomen for the Transit Authority and Port Authority
declined to comment, saying their lawyers were reviewing the
decision.
   The Transit Authority's begging ban was part of its program to
enforce set rules for subway conduct. The lawsuit claimed the
program was designed to roust the homeless from the subway.
   The judge's decision came at a time of heightened scrutiny of
safety issues raised by the presence of homeless people in the
subway.
   On Sunday, a man who was waiting with his 3-year-old son at a
Manhattan station was spat at and punched by a homeless man. Police
said he turned on the homeless man, hit him on the head and beat
his head on the platform, killing him. The man was charged with
first-degree manslaughter.

   Union miners shut down a coal plant
employing non-union workers when more than 500 supporters from
three states marched up an Appalachian hollow in the union's
largest show of strength since June.
   ``We want to send a clear message that we're not going away,''
Bob Phalen, president of UMW District 17, said Friday. ``When
injustice is being inflicted upon our brothers and sisters, we'll
be there to support them.''
   The United Mine Workers want Rum Creek Coal Sales Inc. to stop
using non-union contractors to operate a preparation plant and the
truck lines serving it. Union members had held the jobs until last
August.
   The miners chanted ``UMWA all the way'' as they walked up Rum
Creek Hollow, blocking both lanes of traffic behind a West Virginia
State Police escort. Many were upset that a federal court judge
ordered miners off a private bridge leading to the plant and
limited the number of pickets to 15.
   No violence was reported.
   Rum Creek, which the past four days had ordered its coal trucks
to smash through vehicles left in their path, told federal and
state police they would not attempt to run coal Friday.
   ``It's a cat-and-mouse game,'' Phalen said. ``We know who the
rat is.''
   The march and subsequent rallies at the picket site and a union
camp were the largest gatherings of UMW miners since June, when a
rally in Charleston attracted more than 1,000 miners, the union
said.
   The A.T. Massey Coal Co., Rum Creek Coal's parent company,
credited police for keeping the peace.
   The June rally in Charleston triggered wildcat strikes the next
day. During June and July, more than 43,000 miners in 10 states
walked off their jobs in violation of other union contracts. Many
took days off work on Friday.
   Miners struck Rum Creek in mid-August after it re-opened the
preparation plant with non-union contractors.
   State troopers had advised the miners not to block the public
road.
   The union already was under court order not to block an adjacent
private road leading to the plant. Many of the miners said they
were prepared to be arrested.
   Two UMW members were charged on Wednesday with assaulting
federal officers and released Thursday. Three other miners have
been charged with violating a court order.
   The Rum Creek strike is not related to the 9-month-old strike
against the Pittston Coal Group, which was tentatively settled Jan.
1. The proposed pact has not yet been submitted for ratification by
the rank and file.

<TEXT>
   With 12 chimes of a 500-year-old bell, the beat
of a drum and a deafening roar of firecrackers, Beijing welcomed
the Year of the Horse today.
   At the stroke of midnight, the city's Mayor Chen Xitong struck
the 500-year-old bronze bell _ China's largest and heaviest _ a
dozen times. Residents set off a hail of firecrackers and fireworks
to greet the Lunar New Year, which in China is called Spring
Festival.
   Each lunar year is represented by one of 12 animals of the
Chinese zodiacal calendar. The Year of the Horse follows the Year
of the Snake.
   As the mayor struck the bell, a worker and a soldier nearby beat
two large, red drums atop Beijing's Drum Tower. But both the drums
and the bell were drowned out by the cacophony of firecrackers that
lasted, unbroken, for about 15 minutes.
   The sounding of the bell and drum revived an imperial tradition,
and the official Xinhua News agency said they would be sounded on
the eve of every Spring Festival. The Bell and Drum Towers were
timekeepers for imperial Beijing, but neither has been used for 66
years, since the last emperor left the Imperial Palace.
   ``In the old society, that's how we knew the time,'' said a
60-year-old native of Beijing who lives near the two towers. The
woman, who did not give her name, said it was the first time she
had heard the bell or the drum since 1949 when the Communists took
power.
   Also at midnight, Premier Li Peng and Communist Party chief
Jiang Zemin gave their holiday greetings on television. The unusual
appearance was part of an annual pre-recorded, four-hour New Year's
Eve variety show, one of China's most-watched television shows.
   The Chinese leadership earlier this week traveled to the
provinces to bring Spring Festival holiday greetings to workers and
to thank soldiers for their role in putting down last spring's
pro-democracy movement.
   During a six-day tour of Shanxi province in northern China,
Jiang emphasized the role of the working class and said socialism
will triumph in China if ``we learn from (their) spirit of fearing
no hardship and quietly contributing to the country and the
people.''
   Such exhortations have been common in the wake of last year's
pro-democracy movement, which was violently crushed by the
military. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of people died.
   This year's Spring Festival celebrations in Beijing seemed more
subdued than in past years, when the sound of firecrackers could be
heard all night long.
   Traditionally, Chinese set off firecrackers for almost any
special occasion, but especially at the Lunar New Year because it
is supposed to ward off evil spirits.
   Beijing was bustling for most of the day, as shoppers made their
final purchases for the long weekend.
   Huge quantities of food have been brought into the capital to
ensure bounty for the holiday, and in recent days, the Chinese
media have been filled with reports of an abundent food supply
throughout the country.
   Beijing stores were stocked with $370 million worth of food and
other unspecified commodities, Xinhua reported.
   Fruits from temperate climates, like oranges and bananas and
even kiwi, were on sale, and Xinhua reported that more than 50
kinds of vegetables have been shipped from southern China.
   The news agency said prices for some fruits was down by 20
percent from last year. Inflation, which peaked at an annual rate
of 36 percent in 1988, has been a major complaint among the
Chinese, and the government has scrapped plans to cut back on
subsidies.
   Tens of thousands of people turned out for the first day of the
Longtan Park temple fair, according to a woman at the ticket
window. But inside, vendors selling toys and snacks complained that
the turnout was lower than expected.
   The fair offered a variety of ``Beijing-style snacks,'' from
spicy pancakes to small deep-fried eggs on a stick to candied crab
apples, as well colorful plastic trinkets and household goods.
   Gamblers could try their hand at a portable roulette table,
which offered Lux soap and Hilton cigarettes as prizes, and
children could ride in a dog-drawn cart for about 20 cents.

   A Colombian pilot who flew cocaine for
two Medellin cartel bosses faces possible life in prison and a $4
million fine after pleading guilty to conspiracy to import cocaine.
   Jorge de la Cuesta pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy on
condition that a cocaine-distribution conspiracy count be dropped.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II set sentencing for April 6.
   De la Cuesta was arrested in a crackdown on cocaine traffickers
in Colombia after the assassination of a presidential candidate and
was flown to Jacksonville on Nov. 30.
   Carlos Fernando Arenas Ortega, a former pilot for Lehder and a
government witness, identified de la Cuesta as a pilot for both
Pablo Escobar Gaviria and Carlos Lehder Rivas, two of the cartel's
founders.
   De la Cuesta was indicted nearly a year ago as part of the
so-called ``Son of Lehder'' case. It was so named because it was an
outgrowth of testimony and information gathered during a 1987-88
trial that netted Lehder a lifetime in prison on drug-smuggling
charges.
   In the spinoff trial that ended last October, two men were
acquitted and three were convicted. Ten other defendants pleaded
guilty.
   According to court documents, de la Cuesta learned to fly as a
youth and by age 21 was a pilot for Avianca, the Colombian national
airline.
   He began flying cocaine for Lehder in 1979 and continued into
1980 but left over a dispute about money, court documents said.
   He rejoined the cartel in 1984 and flew about a ton of cocaine
in two flights from Colombia to the Bahamas and a third flight from
Nicaragua to the islands over Cuban airspace, the documents said.

   The high-flying Blackbird
spy plane, which flew faster than a bullet, was officially grounded
after a quarter-century of service.
   The SR-71 ``is an aircraft that has ... truly reached out and
touched the face of God,'' Gen. John Chain Jr., chief of the
Strategic Air Command, said Friday, referring to a famous poem
about flight.
   The crews who took the plane to record heights at speeds of
2,100 mph are ``true American heroes,'' Chain said at Blackbird's
retirement ceremony attended by about 1,000 people.
   The dagger-shaped planes, which the Air Force calls the world's
fastest and highest flying airplane, were permanently grounded in
November.
   The unarmed twin-engine planes capable of photographing a
vehicle license plate from 15 miles above the earth will be
exhibited at museums across the nation.
   ``For me, it's a sad day,'' said Ben Rich, a Lockheed Corp. vice
president who helped design the Blackbird.
   ``I was there at its birth,'' Rich said. ``I'm here at its
retirement. ... We gave the world its finest. But we must go on.''
   A federal budget measure signed last year by President George
Bush deleted more than $200 million for the aging Blackbirds.
   Critics in Congress said the loss of the more versatile SR-71
will leave a gap in U.S. surveillance capabilities.
   ``It's not that there's no need for it. It's just that we're
constrained by money,'' Lt. Col. Rod Dyckman said after flying an
SR-71. ``This will all hit me a little later, that this was my last
flight.''
   The nine existing SR-71s surrounded the stage at the ceremony.
Originally the Air Force had 30 Blackbirds; officials said some
crashed and others simply wore out.
   The Blackbirds' destinations include the National Air and Space
Museum in Washington, D.C., and the Air Force Museum at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.
   Other Air Force base museums scheduled to receive the Blackbirds
will be Offutt in Nebraska; Lackland in Texas; Robins in Georgia;
and Edwards, March and Castle in California.
   One of the jets will go to the museum here, about 110 miles
northeast of San Francisco. The aircraft also operated out of air
fields in Mildenhall, England, and Kadena Air Base in Okinawa.
   Its pilots and navigators, who wore spacesuits during flight,
say they have been attacked numerous times by missiles fired from
ground forces or jet fighters.
   The plane was the first to employ the stealth or radar-evading
technology that is the hallmark of the nation's newest military
aircraft.
   Nearly three decades after the first Blackbirds were built by
Lockheed, the jets still hold world records for speed and altitude.
   The Blackbird's top capabilities remain secret, but the Air
Force says it flies to more than 85,000 feet at more than 2,100 mph
_ or over three times the speed of sound. That's roughly 35 miles a
minute _ faster than a bullet; fast enough to streak from San
Francisco to New York in 1 hour, 45 minutes.

   Two Beirut newspapers today published an
appeal by a city university for the release of three American
educators kidnapped by Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem extremists
three years ago.
   ``We plead with those in a position to help to ensure the
release of our professors,'' said a statement released by Beirut
University College, where the three taught.
   ``Those teachers taught with sincerity and diligence for many
years and shared difficulties and dangers with their colleagues,''
the statement said.
   The Arabic-language statement was carried by the prestigious
An-Nahar and leftist As-Safir dailies.
   The three Americans _ Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse
Turner _ were kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987, from the campus of the
American-affiliated Beirut University College in the city's Moslem
sector by gunmen disguised as policemen.
   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, an underground
pro-Iranian group, claimed responsibility for their abduction.
   A fourth University College educator kidnapped with the
Americans, Mithileshwar Singh, an Indian who lived in the United
States, was released Oct. 3, 1988 after 20 months in captivity.
   Steen, 50, of Arcata, Calif., taught journalism at the college,
Polhill, 55, formerly of New York, was assistant professor of
business and lecturer in accounting at the college, and Turner, 42,
of Boise, Idaho, was a visiting professor of mathematics and
computer science.
   Fifteen other Westerners, including five other Americans, are
held hostage in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Social Philosopher Lewis Mumford Dead at 94</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMENIA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lewis Mumford, a philosopher, planner,
critic and educator who warned of the dehumanizing effect of
technology, died in his spartan, functional country home. He was 94.
   He died on Friday ``of old age'' in his sleep, said his
grandson, James Morss. ``He was frail, but there was no sickness.''
   Mumford, best known for his writings on cities, culture and
architecture, authored more than 30 books, including ``The City in
History,'' for which he received the 1961 National Book Award.
   He was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Reagan in
1986. Recipients are honored for their lifetime contributions to
American arts.
   The roots of Mumford's philosophy grew from the America of a
century ago.
   He embraced the notion of self-reliance put forth by Whitman and
Emerson. He also was inspired by Melville and Thoreau, who stressed
the virtues of humanism and a personalized society.
   ``The test of maturity, for nations as well as individuals, is
not the increase in power,'' he said near the end of his life,
``but the increase of self-understanding, self-control,
self-direction and self-transcendence. For in a mature society, man
himself, and not his machines or his organizations, is the chief
work of art.''
   Mumford urged people to turn away from faceless technology and
return to human feelings and moral values.
   He vehemently denied accusations that he saw science as evil and
wanted to destroy machinery with the hope of bringing back a
pre-industrial society.
   What he feared, he said, was science without conscience and ``a
dominant minority'' of those people who had mastered high
technology holding power over others as a result.
   The illegitimate son of a businessman, Mumford was born in New
York City on Oct. 19, 1895, and grew up on Manhattan's West Side.
   He attended night classes at City College for five years, but
failing health prevented him from completing his degree. Instead,
he took graduate courses at Columbia University and at the New
School for Social Research.
   It was then he discovered the works of Sir Patrick Geddes, a
Scottish town planner whose influence he called the most important
in his life.
   After serving as a naval radio technician in World War I,
Mumford became associate editor of The Dial magazine. His essays on
housing and urban matters led him to become acting editor of The
Sociological Review.
   Mumford was co-founder of the Regional Planning Association of
America and served on the staff of the New York Housing and
Regional Planning Commission.
   In the 1930s, he began weekly art columns and monthly
architecture critiques for The New Yorker.
   From 1934 to 1951, he published four books that became known as
the ``Renewal of Life'' series. They made his international
reputation and landed him on Time magazine's cover.
   The volumes _ ``Technics and Civilization,'' ``The Culture of
Cities,'' ``The Condition of Man,'' and the ``Conduct of Life'' _
established Mumford as a first-rate thinker. Visiting
professorships at MIT, Dartmouth, Stanford and the University of
Pennsylvania followed.
   Among honors bestowed upon him were the President's Medal of
Freedom in 1964, the Gold Medal of the Town Planning Institute, the
Emerson-Thoreau Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
the Leonardo da Vinci Medal of the Society for the History of
Technology and an honorary knighthood of the Order of the British
Empire.
   He is survived by his wife, Sophia; his daughter, Alison Mumford
Morss, and two grandchildren, James and Elizabeth.

<HEAD>Jury Awards Woman's Family Money for Toxic Shock Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Circuit Court jury has found a tampon maker
responsible for a woman's death from toxic shock syndrome in 1978
and has ordered it to pay her family $905,750.
   The jury deliberated 11 hours over two days before deciding on
Friday that Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Products Inc., maker of O.B.
Tampons, was responsible for the death of Donna Marie Davis of
Decatur.
   Ten years ago, toxic shock syndrome was linked to dozens of
women's deaths, and studies suggesting that tampons were a major
cause prompted scores of lawsuits against tampon makers.
   Ms. Davis, 31, was using the O.B. Tampons just prior to her
death, said attorney John Nickley, who tried the case for the
woman's estate.
   Spokesmen for Johnson &amp; Johnson said the company will appeal the
verdict. The spokesmen said the company believes the tampon brand
is safe and was no factor in the woman's death.
   Toxic shock syndrome is a rare, but sometimes fatal condition
linked to tampon use. The common bacterium staphylococcus aureus
can use tampons as a breeding site in the body and produce
poisonous waste which can enter the bloodstream and cause the
illness.
   Ms. Davis died Sept. 2, 1978, after suffering from vomiting,
diarrhea, fever and a rash. All are symptoms of toxic shock
syndrome.
   ``The verdict means more to me than the award does,'' said Ms.
Davis' husband, Harold, 46, who owns and operates a service
station. ``We have tried to find an answer to why she died for 12
years. We wouldn't rest until we found the answer and now we feel
that we have.''

   The state's corrections commissioner
fired the suspended superintendent of the Camp Hill prison for his
actions during a three-day riot that left 123 people injured and
much of the institution in ruins.
   The dismissal of Robert Freeman on Friday came shortly after
Gov. Robert P. Casey recommended the action, citing a commission
report that was sharply critical of management decisions during the
riot in October.
   In addition to the injuries, the rioting caused about $14
million in damage.
   Prison administrators declared the prison secure after a first
night of rioting Oct. 25, but inmates were able to free themselves
and continued their rampage though Oct. 27.
   On Nov. 1, The Associated Press reported guards had complained
that prison officials ignored warnings of cell-locking mechanisms
being broken after the first night of rioting.
   Freeman was suspended the day the report was made. His telephone
number is unpublished, and he could not be reached for comment.
   ``The extreme seriousness of the Camp Hill incident ... requires
that those having responsibility for security at Camp Hill be held
accountable for their actions,'' Casey said.
   Corrections Department spokesman Kenneth Robinson said the
dismissal was effective immediately. He said acting Superintendent
Jeffrey Beard would remain at work at the prison.
   Prison Commissioner David S. Owens Jr., acting on Casey's
recommendation, also fired Camp Hill's deputy for operations,
Robert Smith. Terry Henry, deputy for treatment, will be reassigned
within the department, an action also taken at Casey's request,
Robinson said.
   Casey said he also would have recommended the dismissal of Maj.
John Stover, captain of the guard, but Stover had resigned. Owens,
who had been criticized in the commission report for a
``hands-off'' approach to dealing with the riot, was not sanctioned
by Casey.
   The governor on Friday cited the findings of the Adams
Commission, an independent three-member panel that concluded
management at Camp Hill failed to adequately search the prison
after the first night of rioting, and failed to assure that cells
were locked when the guards said they weren't secure.
   The commission, which presented its report in December, also
found that supervisory personnel failed to keep an adequate force
of state troopers at the prison to prevent a second night of
rioting, and that ample time was available for management to
reconsider its decisions, which did not happen.
   State Rep. Jerry L. Nailor said he was perplexed if the firings
were based on the commission report, because the panel recommended
no dismissals.
   Conflicting testimony during House and Senate hearings from
guards and officials at Camp Hill have raised more questions than
they've answered, he said.
   ``I'm wondering what information the governor has now that the
rest of us haven't heard,'' Nailor said.

   Floods triggered by two days of heavy
rains have devastated the central Java capital of Semarang, leaving
76 people dead and 24 missing, an official said today.
   Also today, a landslide buried 14 people alive and left three
others missing in Jayapura, about 2,000 miles northeast of Jakarta.
   The Banjir Kanal Barat River poured over its banks Friday in the
worst floods in the city in 20 years, breaking an embankment and
crippling traffic in much of the Semarang. Hundreds of homes were
damaged or destroyed.
   Sudharmono, spokesman of the central Java governor's office,
said a rescue team was still searching for the missing. He said
thousands of people were evacuated from the stricken areas and were
being accommodated at schools and other public buildings.
   Large pools of water still cover part of the city, he said.
   In addition to the 14 dead, 16 people were injured in the
landslide in Jayapura, said Rudolf Rahauzune, spokesman of the
governor's office.
   He said the landslide, which followed a night of rain, damaged
or destroyed 20 homes.

<HEAD>Researchers Hope To Stabilize Patients' Immune Systems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new treatment for AIDS that involves
removing, stimulating and then re-injecting certain white blood
cells has the potential to stabilize patients' immune systems, a
researcher said.
   ``It's taking advantage of one's natural defense against the
virus,'' said Dr. Monto Ho, chairman of infectious diseases and
microbiology at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of
Public Health.
   Ho, who is heading what is believed to be the nation's only
clinical trials of the new treatment, said researchers plan to
remove white blood cells that attack cells infected with the AIDS
virus. The removed cells will be treated with stimulants and
incubated for two weeks so they can multiply.
   The activated cells, called killer T-cells, then will be
injected back into the patient from whom they were taken.
   The treatment is being administered to only one person, although
the six-month study calls for six to be tested.
   ``The purpose is to really see if it's toxic,'' Ho said. ``If
it's not toxic, a bigger program will be initiated to find out if
it will really kill the infected cells. Whether it will do that, we
don't know.''
   Researchers hope the activated killer T-cells, or CD8 cells,
will kill or at least inhibit the growth of AIDS-tainted cells and
fight other infections afflicting AIDS patients. The National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is financing the study.
   ``What happens to the immune systems in AIDS patients, it keeps
going down and eventually they die,'' Ho said. ``If you can
stabilize the immune system by restricting the infected cells, then
you have something.''
   The patient who has undergone the treatment was diagnosed about
a year ago with AIDS and has received three infusions in the past
six weeks. He has shown no signs of acute toxicity, Ho said.
   Dr. Jeffrey Laurence, director of the laboratory for AIDS
research at Cornell University, said researchers must make sure the
removed cells cannot harbor the virus.
   ``If they make certain they're not multiplying the virus along
with the killer cells, it sounds like a very good idea and
something worthy of a clinical trial,'' Laurence said.
   Some AIDS patients, however, already have an expanded pool of
killer T-cells, according to Dr. Susan Zolla-Pazner, professor of
pathology at New York University. As a result, providing even more
might not eliminate the infected cells although it might help slow
down the disease, she said.
   ``It's an interesting approach,'' she said.
   As of the end of December, 117,781 cases of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome had been reported to the Centers for Disease
Control. The death count was 70,313.
   University of Pittsburgh researchers plan to treat six patients
with AIDS or AIDS-related complex, a condition preceding the
disease, as part of the study. Six doses of their own activated
cells over 13 weeks will be administered, followed by 11 weeks of
tests.
   The removed cells will be stimulated with interleukin-2, an
immune system booster, as well as another substance. The technique
for isolating and purifying the cells was developed by Applied
Immune Sciences Inc. of Menlo Park, Calif.

<TEXT>
   The Colombian jetliner that crashed on
Long Island, N.Y., killing 72 people, was 23 years old and had been
sent for maintenance 37 times in the last four months, a national
radio network said.
   The RCN network quoted unidentified airport sources in its
report Friday on the maintenance problems of the four-engine Boeing
707.
   Colombia's Civil Aviation Authority does not permit news media
to review aircraft maintenance records, but RCN indicated it spoke
to someone with access to the records.
   It gave no further details on the maintenance records, such as
what the problems were and whether any regulations had been
violated.
   The plane, which had 161 people on board, crashed Thursday night
in Cove Neck, Long Island as it was approaching John F. Kennedy
International Airport in New York. The flight originated in Bogota
and stopped in Medellin.
   Avianca and airport officials have declined to comment on the
possible cause of the accident.
   Some reports said the plane had lost use of an engine, but
Alfredo Parra, a airline pilot instructor inteviewed in Bogota,
said the aircraft could have continued to fly even if it lost two
engines.
   ``Why the aircraft didn't try to land at an alternate airport
even if one or two of its engines was inoperative is an important
question to be asked in the investigation,'' Parra said in an
interview with the Caracol radio network.
   Colombian aviation experts said investigators should try to
determine why the plane _ which some reports said ran out of fuel _
was circling New York instead of heading for an alternative airport
where weather conditions were better. It was raining the night of
the crash.
   A veteran Avianca pilot noted the pilot had to abort his first
landing attempt. He said that when this happens and the 707 must
gain altitude quickly, without much fuel left, the remaining fuel
is forced to the back of tanks and may cause engines to shut off.
He spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
   However, a preliminary investigation showed that 10,000 pounds
of fuel were left in the airplane tanks, National Transportation
Safety Board spokesman Lee Dickinson said Friday night in New York.
   Dickinson said there were indications that at least three of the
four engines were not working at the time of the crash.
   An Avianca spokeswoman, who would identify herself only as
Mercedes, told the AP by telephone that the 52-year-old pilot,
Laureano Caviedes, worked for Avianca since 1962; the co-pilot,
Mauricio Klotz, 27, for 3{ years; and the flight engineer, Matias
Moyano Rojas, 44, for 24 years.

<TEXT>
   Defense attorneys in the McMartin preschool
molestation case blasted the prosecutor, judge and news media after
winning acquittals in the nation's longest criminal trial.
   Attorneys Daniel G. Davis and Dean R. Gits, who represent Ray
Buckey, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, said Friday they
plan to file misconduct complaints with the state bar association
against the chief prosecutor.
   They accused Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin of unfairly
blocking bail for Mrs. Buckey.
   ``She's not fit to have a license to practice law,'' Davis said
of Ms. Rubin. ``I am the prosecutor now.''
   Ms. Rubin said Davis has a ``history of making outrageous,
unfounded and unproven allegations.''
   ``I look forward with a lot of good feelings about Mr. Davis
claiming he's going to refer an investigation to the state bar,''
she said. ``I think it's a wonderful idea and I look forward to
complete vindication.''
   The defense lawyers also said the news media reported the case
inaccurately. They said they believed that the reports led some to
conclude the defendants were guilty.
   Gits said he counted 19 people who heard every day of evidence
in the case. Twelve were jurors; the rest were lawyers, the judge
and court personnel.
   But he noted that TV stations which took polls of their viewers
found that 70 percent to 80 percent believed the verdicts were
wrong.
   ``What the viewers were reflecting was media dissemination (of
the case),'' he said. ``The public had made up its mind the
defendants were guilty. That's a terrible, terrible thing.''
   The Buckeys were cleared of 52 molestation charges last week.
The jury deadlocked on 13 other charges against Buckey.
   The district attorney's office must decide by Wednesday whether
it will retry the former preschool instructor on those charges.
   Rubin said she has been consulting with children and their
parents on the matter.
   Davis also criticized the post-trial TV appearances of Superior
Court Judge William Pounders.
   ``I am saddened to see the trial judge in this case, with
litigation (still) pending, trooping about in television land like
a lightweight, bit actor, making comments about the children,''
Davis said.
   Pounders could not be reached for comment by telephone after
business hours Friday.

<TEXT>
   An elementary school principal whose drug arrest
touched off investigations into city school boards has been
convicted of crack possession.
   ``It was not unexpected,'' said Matthew Barnwell as he left the
court after the jury convicted him. He faces a year in jail and a
$1,000 fine when Judge William Leibovitz sentences him on March 9.
   ``This was a sad duty,'' said Hope Hagler, 43, an attorney and
teacher who was on the Manhattan Criminal Court jury that convicted
Barnwell. ``We were all upset. He was a fine gentleman who gave in
to a weakness.''
   Civil liberties attorney William Kunstler, who represented
Barnwell, said there are ``enormous grounds for appeal.'' He cited
Leibovitz's refusal to permit the jury to visit the site of the
alleged crack purchase.
   The judge allowed the visit in the last trial, which ended with
a jury hung 4-2 for acquittal. Barnwell's first trial ended in a
mistrial before testimony began.
   Barnwell, 56, was arrested on Nov. 11, 1988, minutes after he
bought two $2-vials of crack from a New York street dealer.
   His arrest sparked an investigation of local school boards when
it was revealed that he had kept his job as principal of Public
School 53 in the Bronx for 16 years despite a long record of
absenteeism and tardiness.
   Barnwell was fired two weeks ago by his local school board,
which carried out the recommendation of a disciplinary panel that
found Barnwell had betrayed his pupils and ``the enormity of his
act is clear.''

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II told
citizens of this impoverished island nation today that ``there is
no shame in being poor.''
   Later, he left for Guinea-Bissau, the second country on his tour
of Africa's sub-Saharan nations.
   In a farewell speech to President Aristides Pereira, other
officials and hundreds of faithful, the Roman Catholic leader said:
``I know the difficult problems that Cape Verde, like other
countries of this region ... has to solve _and solve urgently.''
   ``But I also know you can count on the tried and tested spirit
of your people, who hold no illusions that the fight against the
inclement climate and adverse social conditions will be easy.''
   He reminded the people of this Atlantic island nation of a local
proverb: ``There is no shame in being poor.''
   In his final speech Friday to tens of thousands in this onetime
slave-trading center, the pontiff appealed for an end to
discrimination and modern-day slavery of all kinds.
   The pontiff was on his first visit to this 10-island archipelago
about 380 miles west of Senegal in West Africa. He is on an
eight-day tour of Africa's sub-Saharan Sahel region, which has long
been plagued by drought, famine, and the spread of the desert.
   The 45th trip of the pope's 11-year papacy will also take him to
Mali, Burkina Faso and Chad.
   Speaking at an open-air Mass on Quebra Canela beach near the
capital Cidade da Praia, the pontiff said the former Portuguese
colony still bore historic scars from the ``abominable commerce of
human beings.''
   Looking down from a custom-built altar onto the crowded, black
volcanic beach, John Paul said his message was: ``No to
discrimination of any kind, never slavery of man by man, never
again any form of violence that degrades human dignity.''
   This island nation, although arid and poor, appears more
prosperous than other countries of the region thanks mainly to
foreign aid and money sent back by thousands of islanders who live
and work abroad.
   The United States provides $6 million a year to Cape Verde,
making it the second-highest recipient per capita of U.S. foreign
aid in Africa after Egypt, diplomats said.
   Up to 700,000 Cape Verdians _ nearly double the island
population of 360,000 _ live and work abroad, mainly in the United
States, Portugal, France, the Netherlands, and Italy. Up to 400,000
are estimated to live in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
   The islands of Cape Verde first prospered in the 16th century as
a major post for the Portuguese empire's slave trade between Africa
and the Americas. With the demise of the slave trade, the largely
desolate islands slid into decline as a colony of an increasingly
isolated empire.
   Cape Verde gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   Speaking in wind and rain, the pontiff also warned thousands of
young islanders gathered at Praia's sports stadium against another
form of slavery.
   He cautioned against ``moral slavery ... that threatens you most
when you are the least aware ... (persuaded) by the subtle
influence of the latest fashion or the dominant opinion.''
   John Paul urged youths not ``to follow the idols of personal
success, power, riches and eroticism.''

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black workers of the state
transport company today halted one of South Africa's most violent
strikes, a 12-week walkout marked by widespread sabotage and more
than 35 killings.
   The union failed to win even part of its requested 150 percent
pay increase, but South African Transport Services agreed to
recognize the union and rehire all of the more than 23,000 strikers
who were fired.
   Officials of the company and the South African Railway and
Harbor Workers Union signed the settlement today at a ceremony in
Johannesburg. Afterward, they said they hoped for smoother
relations after two strikes in a three-year period.
   In the latest strike, the workers walked out Nov. 2, demanding
that the minimum monthly wage be increased from $240 to $600.
   Numerous battles between strikers and non-strikers followed,
including one clash between hundreds at a train station near
Johannesburg. Railway coaches and tracks were sabotaged in dozens
of incidents, and the company said it suffered property damage of
$16 million.
   One key issue in the dispute was whether the transport service
would officially recognize the strikers' union. The company
maintained the union had not followed proper procedures for
recognition, and insisted on bargaining with a smaller black union
not tied to the militant Congress of South African Trade Unions.
   Jay Naidoo, general secretary of the congress, said at the
signing ceremony today that the settlement ``laid the basis for a
sound relationship'' between the union and the transport service.
   However, the Conservative Party's transport spokesman, Jurg
Prinsloo, said, ``It is shocking that after one of the most violent
strikes .. . the strikers have again been installed in their
posts.''
   The walkout was illegal under legislation that bars strikes in
essential services. The transport company employs about 170,000
people and runs rail and harbor operations nationwide.

   Right-wing whites equipped with
whips and clubs scuffled today with mixed-race demonstrators trying
to hold a picnic at a whites-only park.
   The confrontation occurred at Boksburg Lake, a park that was
declared whites-only in late 1988 after the far-right Conservative
Party took control of Boksburg city council in municipal elections.
   About 100 residents of Reiger Park, a mixed-race neighborhood,
arrived at the lakeside park this morning to picnic. Among the
whites who confronted them were khaki-clad members of the neo-Nazi
Afrikaner Resistance Movement.
   No injuries were reported. But two white men were arrested after
they tore down a protest banner that said: ``Mandela: The freedom
of Boksburg awaits you.''
   Jailed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela is
expected to be freed soon after more than 27 years in prison.
   Residents of black and mixed-race communities adjoining the
industrial city outside Johannesburg staged a 12-month consumer
boycott of white-owned Boksburg stores.
   They called off the protest in December after President F.W. de
Klerk proposed that Parliament, in its upcoming session, consider
repealing the law that allows segregation of local facilities.

   Troops arrested suspected Moslem
militants and searched houses today as they continued a weeklong
crackdown on secessionist violence in Indian-held Kashmir that has
killed more than 70 people.
   Sporadic gunfire was heard late Friday night, but there was no
word of new casualties.
   A senior police official said soldiers in the northern Indian
city of Srinagar were still looking for ``die-hard terrorists'' who
slipped in despite a tough, 24-hour curfew.
   At least 72 people, mostly curfew-defying protesters, have been
killed since Jan. 20 in Srinagar and surrounding towns. The
separatists want to secede from predominantly Hindu India and
establish an independent Kashmiri nation or join the neighboring
Islamic country of Pakistan.
   ``The situation is well under control,'' said Jitendra Narain
Saxena, the top police official in Jammu-Kashmir state, by
telephone. ``We have enforced very strict curfew because we have
information that die-hard terrorists have infiltrated into
Srinagar.''
   As a result of search operations Friday night and early today
``some arrests'' have been made, Saxena said. He refused to give
any numbers.
   A virtual news blackout was imposed Thursday night when local
officials rescinded journalists' curfew passes and warned them that
they risked arrest or getting shot if they tried to leave their
hotel. Most communication with the hotel was cut off at the same
time.
   On Friday, while most of India celebrated the 40th anniversary
of the constitution that marked the founding of the Indian
Republic, Srinagar resembled a ghost town with only military
patrols and a few officials allowed on the streets.
   A gasoline bomb was thrown at soldiers, but no one was injured,
according to police sources in Jammu, the winter capital of
Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Across the frontier, the leader of Pakistan-held Kashmir
threatened Friday to launch a jihad, or Islamic holy war, unless
the United Nations calls a special session on Kashmir before Feb.
17.
   Sikander Hyat Khan demanded the United Nations take action on
its 1948 resolution calling for Kashmiris to vote on whether they
want independence or union with either Pakistan or India.
   The plebiscite was never held, and the Kashmir question has
simmered for four decades. India and Pakistan have gone to war
twice over Kashmir since they became independent from Britain in
1947.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only state in India with a Moslem majority.
Moslems make up 64 percent of the state's 5 million people, but
nationwide they form only 12 percent of the population of 880
million.

   About 1,000 Moslem rebels today
attacked six predominantly Christian villages, killing at least one
person and causing thousands of residents to flee, the military
said.
   An undetermined number of other people _ villagers, soldiers,
and rebels _ were reported killed or wounded.
   Brig. Gen. Orlando Soriano, army regional commander, said the
simultaneous attacks took place around 1 a.m. in the southern
villages outside Pikit town in North Cotabato province, 590 miles
southeast of Manila.
   The Moslem separatists assaulted and burned several homes,
forcing more than 5,000 villagers to leave and seek shelter in
government buildings and schoolhouses in Pikit, Soriano said.
   He said at least one woman villager died in the cross fire.
   Government troops, backed by two helicopter gunships and mortar
fire, were sent to aid village militiamen. They counterattacked in
areas where rebels were believed to be hiding.
   Soriano ordered troops to stop the counterattacks 16 hours after
the rebels assaulted the villages. Government representatives, led
by Norodin Matalam, governor of the nearby province of Maguindanao,
was to negotiate with the rebels' Moro Islamic Liberation Front.
   The rebels attacked to avenge the massacre of five members of a
Moslem family in October by suspected Christian militiamen, Matalam
told reporters.
   On Nov. 19, 1989, several southern provinces and cities vote in
favor of a regional autonony plan proposed by President Corazon
Aquino in an effort to placate the demands of Moslem secessionists.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's Communists today said foreign
observers should be invited to monitor the nation's first
competitive elections in May as ``an additional safeguard'' to
ensure free balloting.
   Also today, the propaganda chief under ousted Communist leader
Erich Honecker was arrested and officials were investigating
charges of high treason against him, the official news agency ADN.
   A front-page editorial in the party daily Neues Deutschland said
having a team of foreign observers monitor the campaign and
elections would be ``good and practical.''
   The paper urged opposition groups to accept the proposal, which
has been proposed to Parliament by interim President Manfred
Gerlach, a member of one of the non-Communist parties in Communist
Premier Hans Modrow's coalition government.
   ``Even if all precautions are taken for free and fair elections,
an additional safeguard cannot hurt,'' Neues Deutschland said.
   The development is the latest effort by the Communists to buoy
their standing since a pro-democracy revolution toppled Honecker on
Oct. 18, opened the Berlin Wall and set up the coalition government.
   ADN said former propaganda chief Joachim Herrmann was arrested,
and it quoted the chief prosecutor as saying he was also being
investigated for his alleged ``responsibility for the
unconstitutional media policy of past years.''
   Herrmann, 61, was the top propaganda official in the
now-dissolved Communist Party Central Committee, a post through
which the Communists controlled national media, including
television and radio.
   The office also ordered the arrest of Gerhard Schuerer, former
head of the State Planning Commission, on corruption charges, ADN
said.
   Herrmann and Schuerer, the latest officials under Honecker to be
ordered arrested, were kicked out of the party Jan. 20.
   New Forum, the largest opposition movement but one of its most
diffuse, began a two-day congress in East Berlin today.
   About 150 delegates of a breakaway group today gathered in
Karl-Marx-Stadt to form the German Forum Party. A delegate,
Frank-Thomas Heinze, said the party will advocate free-market
concepts and German unity, according to ADN.
   On Friday, opposition groups agreed to join Modrow's shaky
government in an effort to keep it afloat until scheduled elections
in May.
   But the reform forces said they will participate only if all
members of Modrow's coalition Cabinet renounce their party
loyalties. It was not immediately clear if Modrow or the other
ministers were willing to serve in such a non-partisan capacity.
   The show of unity from a splintered opposition suggested that
the reformists feel the risk of domestic chaos outweighs their own
concerns of being tainted by association with the current
leadership.
   ``It is simply becoming clear that our responsibility is to keep
the country governable,'' Wolfgang Schnur, chairman of the
conservative Democratic Awakening movement, said on West Germany's
ZDF television.
   In joining the government, the opposition also seems to be
hoping it will benefit from any national exposure, and get some
credit for guiding the country through an uncertain reform phase
until the May 6 vote.
   Opposition representatives declined to say which ministerial
posts they will demand when they open talks with Modrow on Sunday.

   Soviet forces found a weapons arsenal and captured
Azerbaijani nationalist leaders accused of trying to seize control
of the tense republic, Soviet media said today.
   Forty leaders of extremist groups allegedly linked to the
nationalist Azerbaijani People's Front were being held,
Komsomolskaya Pravda said, quoting Lt. Col. A. Sorokovikh, a police
official.
   The daily Trud said more than 1,000 uniforms and a large cache
of arms were found in the front's headquarters. The newspaper said
that some leaders of the front had gone underground and were
preparing ``new mass disorders.''
   The Tass news agency said that Rakhmi Gadzhiyev, identified as
one of the leaders of the front, had been arrested.
   Nearly 150 people were detained overnight in the Azerbaijani
capital of Baku by Soviet troops, who intervened last week in an
effort to quell ethnic bloodshed between Christian Armenians and
Moslem Azerbaijanis.
   Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov told Soviet journalists in Baku
on Friday that troops were forced to enter Jan. 19 because
nationalists were trying to take control of the republic. Earlier
reports had suggested the occupation was designed to stop attacks
on minority Armenians in Baku.
   Also Friday, Baltic activists said Azerbaijani and Armenian
representatives tentatively agreed to negotiate their ethnic
dispute next week in Riga, Latvia.
   However, Romaldus Razhukas, a director of the Latvian People's
Front, said in a telephone interview from Riga that the
Azerbaijanis will hold direct talks only if the Armenians renounce
their claim to part of Azerbaijan's territory.
   The Armenians have demanded that the Nagorno-Karabakh region of
Azerbaijan, a predominantly Armenian enclave, be united with
Armenia.
   The Azerbaijanis want to limit the talks to refugees,
humanitarian issues and securing the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   Activists in the Baltic republics have something of a stake in
peacefully resolving the ethnic strife in Azerbaijan. They fear
that the continued use of force by Moscow could set the stage for
similar intervention in their own pro-independence republics of
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.
   The Tass news agency said today it is becoming more difficult to
find housing for growing numbers of refugees from Azerbaijan. It
did not give the nationalities of the refugees, but it recent days
more Russians have been fleeing in the face of growing anti-Russian
tension.
   Baku, the scene of heavy fighting earlier in the week, was
reported to be calmer today. Stores were beginning to open,
although there were shortages and long lines, Trud reported.
Strikes continued to paralyze the region with 400 enterprises at a
standstill in Baku alone, Komsomolskaya Pravda reported.
   The Soviet military intervened after Azerbaijani extremists
began killing Armenians living in Baku on Jan. 13. The military
raid has drawn criticism and support in the country and abroad as
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev struggles with perhaps the most
difficult of the nation's many crises.
   In remarks published by the government newspaper Izvestia, Yazov
appeared to stress that controlling the political situation was the
reason for the Soviet military action.
   He said the People's Front had declared its own state of
emergency in Baku a full day before the soldiers moved in, and ``in
many regions of the city ... Soviet and party organs had ceased to
control the situation.''
   Previously, Gorbachev and other top officials have cited public
safety _ dozens of people were killed during anti-Armenian riots in
Baku _ as the reason for the military assault. But critics of the
military move have contended that most of the Armenians had been
evacuated before the army moved into Baku. Azerbaijani nationalists
have accused Moscow of trying to crush their movement.
   Tass said today that 125 people, including 27 soldiers and
police, had died during the assault by Soviet forces on Baku and
the ensuing battle with nationalists.
   In an interview published today in Komsomolskaya Pravda, Yazov
said that an estimated 40,000 weapons were in the hands of the
population in Azerbaijan.

<TEXT>
   Communist leaders met today to dismantle
their faltering party and replace it with a pro-democracy group.
Party chief Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski announced that he will not lead
the new organization.
   Rakowski said it was time for ``a new generation'' to take over
the party, which this year relinquished power to the Solidarity
movement after a disastrous defeat in Poland's freest elections
since World War II.
   The weekend congress planned to expunge the party of its of
Communist ideology, endorse parliamentary democracy and create a
new social democratic organization.
   The party, formally known now as the Polish United Workers
Party, hopes its new incarnation will become the main left-wing
party in a new democratic political spectrum.
   ``I consider it appropriate to pass over the helm to a new
generation,'' said Rakowski at the close of an hour-long speech
reviewing the party's past and the future at the start of the
congress. ``I personally am not going to run for leadership of the
party and I think that comrades of my generation will not do so.''
   More than 1,600 delegates gathered at Congress Hall in Warsaw's
imposing Stalinist-era Palace of Culture and Science.
   The party now claims 2 million members, but the group that
emerges from the congress will be much smaller, said party
Politburo member Janusz Reykowski in an interview Thursday.
   A schism is possible with either orthodox Communists or
progressives leaving to form their own parties, he said.
   Rakowski appealed to delegates to prevent a split. ``If we want
to exist as a real force in the Polish political scene, we should
not leave the Congress Hall through different exits,'' he said.
   Rakowski said he struggled to reform the party since the Stalin
era ended in 1956, but failed because many members clung to old
ideas and the Soviet Union interfered with reforms until the
emergence of Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1985.
   ``It's true that we deserved a good whipping,'' he said of the
past.
   But he said the Polish party also deserved credit for being
``braver'' than its East bloc counterparts in carrying out reforms.
He praised President Wojciech Jaruzelski, the former party chief,
for the decision a year ago to lift the ban on Solidarity.
   Lech Walesa, leader of the Solidarity trade union movement that
forced Poland's changes, and the Communist Party's delegation in
parliament have supported parliament deputy Tadeusz Fiszbach, 54,
to be the reformed party's new leader. Fiszbach is a former Gdansk
party chief ousted from official positions in the 1980s because he
opposed the 1981 imposition of martial law.
   Rakowski, 65, said early in January that he also would run for
the top spot. But he appeared to be reconsidering this week in the
face of opposition from those who argued that the new party stands
no chance unless it introduces an entirely new leadership.
   Reykowski had also said it might be time for a ``clear
generational change.'' Possible candidates include Slawomir Wiatr,
37, the founder of a liberal faction in the party; Aleksander
Kwasniewski, 35, who is in charge of national sports and
recreation; and Leszek Miller, 43, a party secretary and Rakowski
loyalist.
   The Communist Party was a merger forced by Soviet leader Josef
Stalin of the Communist Polish Workers Party and the Polish
Socialist Party, a left-wing party dating from the 19th century
that enjoyed broad popular support.
   Now the party says it wants to give up the Communist part of
that heritage and build on the old socialist tradition.

<HEAD>Canadian Archbishop Who Battled Over Funding Dies in Canada</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anglican Archbishop Lewis Garnsworthy, an
outspoken cleric who tangled with political leaders over school
funding and once scolded his own church for being too
``respectable,'' has died. He was 67.
   A church spokesman said Garnsworthy died in his sleep Friday at
Toronto Western Hospital, where he had been admitted last weekend.
   No cause of death was given. However, in 1983 Garnsworthy had a
cancerous lung removed. Two years ago, he had abdominal surgery to
remove a tumor.
   Garnsworthy, a tall, stern-faced man with a booming voice,
tackled some of the church's thorniest questions and often
expressed what others left unsaid.
   ``He constantly raised issues people had to struggle with,''
said the Rev. Elizabeth Kilbourn, who was ordained by Garnsworthy
to become one of denomination's first women ministers. ``He wasn't
a wimp.''
   He once said a proposed union of the Anglican and United
churches had a ``snowball's chance in Hades.''
   He criticized the Roman Catholic Church for its ``fortress
mentality.''
   He also derided his own Anglican church of the 1940s as ``a sort
of mascot at cocktail parties _ part of the respectable scene.''
   He once described many church services as boring and called for
the burning of church pews and the melting down of collection
plates.
   Garnsworthy, who was born in Edmonton, studied theology at
Wycliffe College in Toronto. He was ordained into the priesthood in
1946 and served in Halifax before coming back to Toronto.
   In 1972, he took over as the ninth bishop of Toronto, the
largest Anglican diocese in Canada. He said he wanted to reach out
to secular society.
   Elected Archbishop of Ontario in 1979, Garnsworthy's later
battled then Premier William Davis' plan to extend funds to
Catholic school on a separate basis from the public system.
Garnsworthy favored one publicly funded system.
   A week before the election, he compared Davis to Adolf Hitler
for making the decision ``by decree.'' The archbishop lost that
fight, but some angry Conservatives later blamed him after the 1985
provincial election ended the party's 43-year dynasty in Ontario.
   Garnsworthy, who retired in 1988, is survived by his wife Jean,
a son and daughter and a granddaughter.
   A funeral service will be held Monday at St. James Cathedral in
Toronto.

<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with charges read, Politburo member
saying he helped Ceausescu with order. No pickup.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nationally televised trial began
today for four former associates of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu
charged with participating in a crackdown that led to thousands of
deaths during the revolution.
   One of those on trial, former Poliburo member Ion Dinca,
testified he helped Ceausescu ``put into practice the criminal
measures to suffocate in blood the justified revolution of the
people.''
   The four were being tried by a panel of five uniformed military
judges in a hall seating hundreds of people at the Romanian
military academy in Bucharest.
   The trial is the first of top associates of Ceausescu, whose
brutal 24-year rule ended in a popular revolution in December.
Prosecuting Ceausescu loyalists is a key test of the provisional
government, which is struggling to gain the support of the people
and has promised free elections in May.
   The trial opened one day after the vice president of the
provisional government resigned, claiming that ``Stalinistic
methods'' are being used by the nation's new leaders.
   Those on trial include former party secretary Emil Bobu, No. 3
under Ceausescu and his wife, Elena; former Interior Minister Tudor
Postelnicu, who headed the hated secret police; and ex-Politburo
members Manea Manescu and Dinca. If convicted, they could receive
20-year prison sentences.
   The four sat together in a box in the courtroom, with two
uniformed guards behind them. The trial began with each of the
defendants asked to list his age, background and education. The
charges were then read as the four defendants listened impassively.
Then the questioning began.
   The charges referred to Ceausescu and his wife as the
``authors'' of the genocide but said the four defendants did not
act to block the Ceausescus from taking illegal actions and
therefore were guilty of complicity.
   The Ceausescus were found guilty of ``grave crimes'' and
executed Dec. 25. Among those charges was genocide, which officials
said referred to 60,000 people slain during the Communist
dictator's regime.
   The defendants were not asked at first to plead to the charges,
but were questioned about events leading to orders for the security
forces to open fire on unarmed demonstrators during the revolution.
   The order was given by Ceausescu at a meeting of the Political
Executive Committee of the Communist Party, or Politburo, on Dec.
17 while demonstrators in the western city of Timisoara were
demanding the dictator's ouster.
   Dinca said Ceausescu wanted soldiers to fire in the air over the
heads of demonstrators and at the legs of those who broke into
stores, party headquarters or other institutions.
   He said Ceausescu then asked if those at the meeting had other
opinions.
   ``Nobody had any other opinions,'' Dinca recalled.
   He did not make clear how the orders were expanded to shots
fired at the heads and bodies of demonstrators but accepted
responsibility for what he called ``criminal measures.''
   ``I gave my help to Ceausescu to put into practice the criminal
measures to suffocate in blood the justified revolution of the
people,'' he said.
   When asked why the revolution was justified, Dinca said the
people suffered ``a lack of constitutional rights ... human freedom
... a lack of food and medication.''
   The charge was read out as falling under the section of the
Romanian penal code that says: ``Genocide constitutes the action of
destroying a nation, a community or an ethnic group by murder.''
   Western diplomats in Bucharest, citing witness accounts and
their own assessments, believe 10,000 people died in the uprising.
   When he resigned Friday, Vice President Dumitru Mazilu said
``Stalinist methods and practices'' are still being used by the
provisional government and ``the press is still directed to destroy
some people and promote others.''
   ``I am convinced that those who have carried out the revolution
will never accept that it be taken over by people who haven't given
anything of themselves to it,'' he said, after reading his
resignation on Radio Free Europe.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded near the home of
Lebanon's top Shiite Moslem cleric today, but the assassination
attempt failed when the vehicle hit a pile of sand and blew up
before reaching its target, police said.
   A police statement said an unidentified driver jumped out of the
explosive-packed Renault-12 sedan as it moved into the alley toward
a west Beirut building housing the third-floor apartment of Sheik
Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin.
   The car drifted to the left, ``hit a sand rampart roadblock and
exploded about 150 (yards) from the house, causing no casualties or
serious damage,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be named under
standing rules.
   Shamseddin, 55, is vice chairman of the Higher Shiite Islamic
Council, which leads day-to-day spiritual affairs of the 1.2
million Shiite Moslems who make up Lebanon's largest sect.
   Shamseddin took over after the council's chairman, Imam Moussa
Sadr, mysteriously disappeared in September 1978 during a visit to
Libya.
   The police statement said the car was rigged with 55 pounds of
explosives. It exploded at about 6:30 a.m. in the residential
district of Tallet Khayat.
   ``Several cars parked in the area were damaged in the explosion
which also shattered window glass. No casualties were reported.
   ``The sheik was at home at the time of the explosion, but he was
not hurt,'' the statement said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the car bomb. By police count,
80 people were killed and 342 wounded in nine car bombings in
Lebanon last year.
   Security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
believe the car bombing attack might be an offshoot of the power
struggle within the Shiite community between pro-Iranian
fundamentalists of Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed secular Amal
militia.
   Shamseddin is a moderate who sympathizes with Amal's chief Nabih
Berri, who is also minister of water and hydraulic resources in the
government of President Elias Hrawi and Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
   Berri is locked in a war of words with former Iranian Interior
Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, the hard-liner who founded Hezbollah
when he was ambassador to Syria in the early 1980s.
   The police spokesman said Amal and Hezbollah fighters skirmished
today with machine guns in south Lebanon's Iqlim al-Tuffah
district, but no casualties were reported. By police count, 98
people have been killed and 286 wounded since the latest round of
Amal-Hezbollah clashes began in the province Dec. 23.
   Today's explosion came a few days after Hrawi's government said
it had worked out a security plan for west Beirut calling for the
withdrawal of all militias. Broad lines of the plan were worked out
in three days of talks between Hrawi and Syrian President Hafez
Assad in Damascus.
   In a joint news conference with Assad on Tuesday, Hrawi said the
security plan would turn Beirut into an ``oasis of peace.''
   Hrawi leads a Christian-Moslem government that is backed by
Syria, which has the largest military presence in Lebanon.
Christian Gen. Michel Aoun, whose forces control the Christian
enclave, refuses to recognize the government and has vowed to drive
the Syrians from Lebanon.
   The security plan, according to government sources, is to be put
into effect early next week.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the plan
calls for troops loyal to Hrawi's government and Lebanese police to
join and then replace Syrian troops in most of west Beirut.
   No Lebanese or Syrian forces will deploy in the heart of south
Beirut's slums, where underground pro-Iranian factions holding most
of the 18 Western hostages in Lebanon are based, the source said.
   There are eight American hostages, including Terry A. Anderson,
41, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who
was kidnapped March 16, 1985. He is the longest held Western
hostage.
   Syrian troops moved into west Beirut to end three years of
militia anarchy in February 1987. The militias, including
Hezbollah, moved out.
   However, militias streamed back into west Beirut last summer
during six months of artillery duels between the Syrians and the
20,000 soldiers of Aoun. The private armies are blamed for the
robberies, car thefts and holdups that have plagued west Beirut
since their return.

<HEAD>Winnie Mandela Says New Problems May Affect Husband's Release</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PAARL, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winnie Mandela said today that
complications have arisen that may affect the expected release of
her imprisoned husband, African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela.
   ``It is quite clear there are a lot of hurdles along the way. It
is quite clear problems have cropped up about his immediate
release,'' Mrs. Mandela told journalists after a four-hour visit
with her husband.
   She appeared pensive and uneasy, in contrast to her exuberance
three weeks ago when she emerged from a visit beaming with optimism
that his freedom was imminent.
   Mandela, 71, has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life
sentence for helping to plan the start of the ANC's anti-government
sabotage campaign. He is the country's best-known black leader, and
the government has expressed interest in his offer to mediate in
negotiations with the ANC.
   Mrs. Mandela declined to discuss the new complications, saying:
``I'm in no position to explain the government's problems.''
   Mrs. Mandela declined to say whether her husband's status had
been affected by the publication Thursday in an anti-apartheid
newspaper of a lengthy policy statement he wrote last year. The
document defended long-term ANC positions, including the use of
violence, and urged the government to open negotiations that would
lead to full political rights for the black majority.
   ``All we can say at this stage was that the release of the
document was not according to his plan,'' she said.
   The government and Mandela have confirmed the authenticity of
the document, but Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said Friday the
government is treating with greater importance a secret peace plan
presented to him and President F.W. de Klerk by Mandela in December.
   The ANC, which has the largest following of any black
organization in South Africa, has said it would enter negotiations
if de Klerk frees Mandela and other political prisoners, lifts bans
on the ANC and other outlawed groups, ends the state of emergency
imposed in 1986 and halts political trials and executions.
   De Klerk has said he would like to remove obstacles to
negotiations, and is expected to address Parliament Feb. 2 about
the ANC's conditions.
   Despite the complications, Mrs. Mandela said arrangements for
her husband's release were continuing.

<HEAD>Iran Protests Manila Showing of Hollywood Movie Mocking Khomeini</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The release here of the film ``The
Naked Gun'' has drawn the ire of the Iranian Embassy, which
demanded it not be shown because of a scene that mocks the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   A letter sent by the embassy Friday to the Department of Foreign
Affairs said the Paramount Pictures film insults the memory of
Iran's late spiritual leader.
   ``In this film, the great personality of our respected leader,
who was the leader of the Moslem world, has been disgraced,'' the
letter said. ``The embassy expects the Department of Foreign
Affairs to stop (the) showing of this film as well as its
rescheduling or reshowing in the Philippines.''
   The 1988 movie, whose complete title is ``The Naked Gun: From
the Files of Police Squad!'' stars Leslie Nielsen as the incredibly
incompetent detective Lt. Frank Drebin.
   In one scene, Drebin punches a character made to look like
Khomeini and reveals a spiked, punk hairdo under his turban.
   The Philippine Daily Inquirer on Saturday quoted Manuel Morato,
chief of the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board,
as saying he had ordered local cinemas to cut the scene.
   Morato was further quoted as saying that his office had
initially approved the scene being included because it was ``done
in jest and, therefore, not offensive.''
   Khomeini, who died in June 1989, is not the only world leader
mocked in the movie.
   In another scene, the police detective grabs a character made to
look like Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and rubs off the
birthmark on his head.

<HEAD>East German Eavesdropping on Bonn Reportedly Routine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany has bugged telephone
conversations of West German government officials for years, and
evidence indicates it continues to do so, a news magazine reported
Saturday.
   East Berlin's eavesdropping targets in Bonn include the
chancellor's office, government ministries, political parties and
the federal Parliament, the Hamburg-based magazine Der Spiegel said
in its latest edition.
   It quoted unnamed renegade East German agents and officials in
the West German capital.
   ``The entire political and administrative area was monitored to
a degree of perfection that shocked us,'' it quoted a high-ranking
Bonn official as saying.
   The official, who was not named, said Bonn has ``clear
evidence'' that East Germany's new Communist-led government, in
power since last fall's peaceful revolution, has kept up the
intelligence gathering.
   To combat the snooping, the West German government is
increasingly using courier services, Spiegel quoted the official as
saying.
   Despite being under Allied administration, West Berlin in most
practical ways is a West German enclave in the middle of East
Germany.
   East Germany's new government has dropped plans for creating a
secret police force before free elections in May, but officials
have made plain that foreign spying will not be stopped in the
meantime.

   The search continues, but no traces of a U.S.
Marine pilot or his fighter plane have been found since the
aircraft went down off Okinawa last week, officials said Saturday.
   The one-seat AV-8B Harrier aircraft, which was flying from
Kadena Air Base on Okinawa Island, in southern Japan, to Osan Air
Base in Korea, crashed at about 5:05 p.m. Friday, according to a
statement released by the U.S. military in Japan.
   The missing pilot's name and hometown have been withheld pending
notification of next of kin, the U.S. military statement said.
   Japan's coast guard dispatched three patrol vessels carrying 70
crew members to carry out the search, along with a C-130 aircraft
dispatched by the U.S. Marines and Air Force, according to a coast
guard spokesman, Masataka Kin.
   The USS St. Louis also was diverted to the area to help in the
search.
   The plane crashed 23 miles northeast of Iheyajima Island as it
flew in formation with another Harrier jet. The cause of the
accident is under investigation.
   The plane was assigned to Marine Attack Squadron 542 and based
in Japan for a six-month deployment program. The squadron's home
base is Cherry Point, N.C.

<TEXT>
   Fur-hatted Muscovites have been peering through
the construction fence for weeks at the glowing golden arches
shimmering in the winter gloom.
   A glittering McDonald's is just about ready to open, and it is
more than a Big Mac and fries _ although that's a lot in a country
of food shortages.
   The McDonald's also is a first taste of what Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's perestroika can offer. It is capitalism and consumerism
in the middle of Moscow. It's Western efficiency, friendly service,
a clean, brightly lit place to eat _ things Communism hasn't
offered many Soviet citizens.
   The grand opening is Wednesday, and 18-year-old Oleg Mukhin is
learning how to smile.
   ``We're supposed to smile all the time _ people will think we've
gone loony!'' said Mukhin, one of the 630 people hired to run the
restaurant.
   They also are being drilled in such strange Western habits as
actually greeting customers and saying, ``Thank you.''
   The restaurant near Pushkin Square was 14 years in the planning,
but Gorbachev's encouragement of warmer East-West relations,
foreign investment and modernization made it possible.
   If all goes well, McDonald's will show some Soviet people that
life is not all dim cafeterias with greasy tables where rice and
fatty meat are sold by surly workers.
   McDonald's, says Mukhin, ``is for people to see how it's
possible to live.''
   It may also teach Mukhin something he thinks he needs to know
for his future. ``Where else can you study capitalism and get paid
for it?'' he asks.
   Unlike nearly every other foreign firm that has come to Moscow
since the Cold War started warming up, McDonald's will be for
Soviet citizens, not just privileged foreigners with hard currency.
   ``Let's put a sign right here: For Rubles Only,'' said George
Cohon, chairman of McDonald's of Canada and the man behind this
14-year quest, as he stepped through the last-minute sawdust.
``Just like the ones they have on the dollar stores that say, ``For
Foreign Currency Only.''
   McDonald's of Canada says it spent $50 million to enter the
Soviet market, building not just a restaurant but its own dairy,
bakery, sauce kitchens and meat-processing plant to ensure steady
supplies, primarily from Soviet sources.
   Cohon said customers will pay about three rubles _ about two
hours' pay for an average Soviet worker or a starting McDonald's
employee _ for a famous ``Beeg Mak.''
   For foreign tourists, that's cheap: about 50 cents at the
special tourist exchange rate, $5 at the official commercial rate.
   But even the king of the fast-food franchises can't promise
Muscovites a quick bite to eat. Police Maj. Gen. Nikolai Myrikov,
better known in the neighborhood for directing roundups of
dissidents on Pushkin Square, stopped by this week to plan crowd
control for a line expected to stretch so far that it will take a
couple of hours to get to the door.
   Still, it will be a ``real'' line in Soviet parlance, a line
that moves, as opposed to the dozens that just keep people waiting
forever, such as the 17-year wait for a phone. As the biggest
McDonald's in the world, it is designed to serve 1,250 people an
hour.
   A second McDonald's, out of a planned 20, will sell for hard
currency and cater to a foreign community that would rather pay
more than stand in line.
   The hamburger chain also will give hundreds of young people
unique experience in the management and sales techniques of the
capitalist West:
   _Don't ask the customer if he or she wants a large or a small
drink, a youthful Soviet crew chief tells his trainees. Say,
``Large?'' to encourage greater spending, he explains.
   _Everyone learns every job in the store, something that would
boggle the mind of the Aeroflot cashier who is incapable of quoting
a price on a flight because her only job is accepting money.
   _``If I want to take a screwdriver from the storeroom, I don't
need six papers and five signatures,'' marveled dairy manager
Alexander Omenchenko.
   It is people like Omenchenko who will make or break McDonald's.
This is a country in which the greatest consideration in taking a
job is often not the salary but the opportunity for theft and
bribe-taking.
   Yet Cohon and his staff say they have managed to find the best,
after an ad in a Moscow newspaper swamped the local post office
with 25,000 applications for the 630 jobs.
   Still, purchasing manager Vladimir Boras, a veteran of
McDonald's first venture into the Communist world, in Yugoslavia,
predicts that 240 of the young people will quit within a month in
the face of the capitalist concept of hard work and the flood of
hungry customers.
   Despite the 12-hour days Omenchenko is putting in just prior to
opening, he's glad he made the switch from his old job in a
scientific institute.
   ``I want to see modern technology,'' he said, ``and I want to
show myself. I want to see what I can do.''

   The hopes of Herbert and Jutta
Schreiber soared when the Berlin Wall opened. But after a couple of
months, they left East Germany rather than wait for a good life
that might never come.
   ``The government talks about everything, but nothing has really
changed,'' Mrs. Schreiber, 46, said of her homeland.
   They are among the 850 new arrivals temporarily housed in
emergency quarters aboard seven Rhine River tour ships at
Duesseldorf.
   Since Jan. 1, more than 33,000 East Germans, as many as 2,000 a
day, have demonstrated what they think of prospects for significant
improvements in their homeland. They left.
   Some West German politicians fear the year-end tally could reach
1 million.
   ``Those are figures that once caused the Berlin Wall to be
built,'' a West German magazine quoted Interior Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble as saying.
   West Germany is helping rebuild East Germany's economy, not only
in hopes closer ties will lead to eventual German unification, but
in a bid to give East Germans good reasons to stay at home.
   The East Germans know they have some leverage. A week ago, about
60,000 suitcase-carrying East Germans marched into West Germany in
a symbolic exodus staged to show their dismay with conditions at
home.
   They stayed in the West just a short time but carried posters
warning ``The Next Time, It Will Be For Real.''
   The unending stream of East Germans is raising concern about how
long East Germany can withstand the drain, and how long West
Germany can withstand the enormous burden on its social services
and housing market.
   More than 340,000 East Germans moved to West Germany last year.
   East Germany's Communist Party made a bold gamble Nov. 9, when
it opened its borders to show that a more democratic state was in
the making. The flow of skilled workers to the West slowed then,
but the departures have picked up in recent weeks as the Communist
government hangs on to power and bleak living standards persist.
   Resettlers give a litany of reasons for leaving: total mistrust
of the Communist Party's promises for real political change;
frustration over the lack of a unified opposition; doubts that
economic conditions will ever be seriously improved, or a
conviction that the only hope for resuing their homeland is
reunification.
   ``I had hopes that things would really change,'' said
22-year-old Torsten Herz, a East German resettler aboard one of the
tour ships. ``But the changes aren't occurring fast enough.''
   Herbert Schreiber, a 42-year-old laborer, complained about low
salaries and a severe shortage of consumer goods in East Germany.
   ``Consumer goods are exhorbitantly priced, and the ones
available are junk. It's been this way for years, and I don't see
any changes,'' he said.
   West Germany has a serious housing shortage, and East German
resettlers can expect a wait of up to three years in temporary
quarters before they move into permanent lodgings.
   But West Germany's prosperous economy offers them greater
prospects than in East Germany. And while they're adjusting to
their new surroundings, the resettlers are cradled by Bonn's social
welfare net.
   East Germans resettlers are automatically given 200 marks ($118)
in ``bridging-over money'' when they arrive in West Germany.
   They also are eligible for the same state pensions as West
Germans.
   In addition, an unemployed resettler can collect ``integration
money'' of $647 a month for one year, according to the West German
Interior Ministry.
   That may not sound like much, but it's higher than the average
monthly East German salary of about $530, and compares to an
average monthly salary of $1,882 in West Germany.
   Many West Germans still resent the expenditure of their
hard-earned tax money on those flooding in from the East.
   According to an opinion poll released Jan. 22 by West German
television, 52 percent of those questioned think the state funds
should be scaled back.
   With federal elections slated for December, West German
politicians themselves are starting to talk about trimming benefits
for East Germans and ethnic German emigres from Eastern Europe.
   West German officials fear there could be an even greater surge
of resettlers if East Germany's May 6 elections should put the
Communists back in power.
   ``There must be a lot of people waiting with packed suitcases to
see if there will be positive signals on May 6,'' said Hans-Joachim
Muehlhaus, a Duesseldorf-based official for the German Red Cross.

   Moslem militants fighting for an
independent nation burned Indian flags on the streets during a
two-hour break in a week-old curfew in the Kashmir Valley,
witnesses said.
   Hundreds of soldiers and paramilitary policemen patrolled
Srinagar and adjoining towns.
   At least 72 people, mostly curfew violators, have been killed
since Jan. 20, when troops and police officers fanned out in the
northern valley to counter militants demanding secession of
predominantly Moslem Kashmir from mostly Hindu India.
   The government repeated charges that neighboring Pakistan was
fomenting the trouble and appealed to the United States and several
other countries to ensure the situation does not get out of hand.
   Pakistan has denied fueling the secessionist movement.
   Journalists were forbidden from going on the streets of
Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, and a district
judge ordered the expulsion of five foreign correspondents, from
Time, Newsweek, the Christian Science Monitor, United Press
International, and the French news agency Agence France-Presse.
   District Magistrate Ghulam Abbas said the presence of the
reporters and photographers ``was adjudged prejudicial to the
security of the state.''
   There were no sounds of gunfire in the city Saturday.
   An official spokesman in Jammu, the winter capital of the state,
said the situation there ``was under control.''
   Authorities relaxed the curfew in Srinagar for two hours
Saturday, but few people went outside because it was raining.
Residents were not informed of the break until a radio announcement
about 45 minutes before the break was scheduled to end.
   Groups of young Moslem men gathered at two places in the city
and burned Indian flags, witnesses said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The last break in the round-the-clock curfew was Thursday. The
curfew was abruptly imposed again after police said Moslem
militants killed four air force officers on the outskirts of the
city.
   ``We have enforced a very strict curfew because we have
information that die-hard terrorists have infiltrated into
Srinagar,'' said Jitendra Narain Saxena, the state's top police
official.
   Saxena said some arrests were made Friday night and early
Saturday. He refused to give any numbers.
   The last known casualties in the region occurred Thursday, when
paramilitary troops opened fire on rioting militants in Handwara,
40 miles northwest of Srinagar.
   An official spokesman said 11 people were killed and 14 injured.
   Kashmir has been a disputed area since 1947 when India and
Pakistan gained independence after the partition of British-ruled
India. Some of the militants want Kashmir to unify with Pakistan.
   The two countries have fought three wars, two of them over
Kashmir. The region is divided into Indian and Pakistani sectors.
   The leaders of Pakistan-held Kashmir have threatened to stage an
Islamic holy war unless the United Nations calls a special session
on Kashmir before Feb. 17.
   Sikander Hyat Khan, prime minister of Pakistan-controlled
Kashmir, demanded the United Nations take action on its 1948
resolution calling for Kashmiris to vote on whether they want
independence or union with either Pakistan or India.
   The vote was never held.
   The Moslem separatist movement escalated in recent weeks and
culminated with the government crackdown last week. The crackdown
was accompanied by the withdrawal of curfew passes to journalists
and the snapping of many telephone and telex lines to Srinagar.
   Jammu-Kashmir state, which consists of mostly Moslem Kashmir and
mostly Hindu Jammu, is the only state in India with a Moslem
majority. Moslems make up 64 percent of the state's 5 million
people, but nationwide they form only 12 percent of India's 880
million people.

<TEXT>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ Vice President Dan Quayle began his
fence-mending trip to Latin America today by assuring leaders that
the last of the U.S. forces who invaded Panama will leave that
country within weeks.
   Quayle's first stop was the Honduran capital, where he had
breakfast with Salvadoran president Alfredo Cristiani. Both leaders
were in Honduras to attend the inauguration of Rafael Callejas, the
Nationalist Party leader who won last November's presidential
election.
   Details of the meeting with Cristiani were not immediately
known. But it had been expected that the two would talk about
economic policy, human rights in El Salvador and progress on the
investigation into the slaying of six Jesuit priests. Cristiani's
government has arrested and charged a group of military officers in
the case.
   ``In this case he is doing the right thing,'' Quayle said. ``We
are encouraged by the progress he is making.''
   Quayle also praised Cristiani for recognizing Guillermo Endara,
the Panamanian president installed after the U.S. invasion of
Panama on Dec. 20.
   Quayle said Friday he expected to listen to objections from the
Latins, especially President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, who
are upset that much of the U.S. force remains from the invasion.
   The vice president also scheduled private meetings today with
leaders of Guatemala, Belize, Venezuela and Costa Rica, who were at
the inauguration.
   Quayle said he hoped for a positive reception from the Latin
leaders, but conceded the bitter taste left by the invasion. But
Quayle said en route that he believes he can assure them the troops
will soon be gone.
   He predicted it will be a matter of ``weeks rather than months''
before the troop strength is back to the normal 12,000 from the
high of 26,000 that were there for the invasion.
   ``I hope the reception is a good one,'' Quayle told reporters
before leaving Friday. ``My message will be one of friendship,
consultation, where do we go from here. How do we build democracy
in Panama. How do we build democracy in our Western Hemisphere.''
   Tonight, Quayle flies on to Panama where he will meet Sunday
with Endara and will watch the Super Bowl on TV with U.S. forces.
   Quayle will discuss with Endara the details of Bush's new $1
billion aid package to help Panama recover from invasion damage.
   Bush announced the package Thursday, and on Friday he took
another step to help boost Panama's economy, which was devastated
by economic sanctions against the regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega and by government corruption.
   Bush told Congress Friday that Panama is now cooperating in
international anti-drug efforts and requested a resolution enabling
Panama to receive benefits withheld as part of the U.S. economic
sanctions aimed at toppling Noriega.
   The administration moved the drug certification up from its
scheduled review in March as part of its effort to bolster the
Endara government.
   Governments that are deemed uncooperative on the drug front
cannot receive certain U.S. preferential benefits.
   In his letter to Congress, Bush said, ``Panama is fully
cooperating with us on the war on drugs. In addressing the urgent
issues connected with rebuilding virtually every aspect of
Panamanian society since coming into office, the government of
President Guillermo Endara has made the war against drugs a
centerpiece of its program.''
   Bush has said he wants Quayle's talks to help soothe the anger
that remains over the Panama invasion, widely viewed in the region
as a violation of Panama's sovereignty. In addition, the Latin
countries objected when U.S. troops surrounded the Vatican Embassy
where Noriega initially took refuge and disapproved of the
intrusion into the home of the Nicaraguan ambassador.

<HEAD>Top Cleric Escapes Assassination Attempt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's top Shiite Moslem cleric
escaped an assassination attempt Saturday when a car packed with
explosives struck a pile of sand and blew up just before reaching
his home, police said.
   Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin was at home but unhurt when the
red Renault-12 sedan carrying 55 pounds of explosives blew up about
150 yards from his third-floor apartment, a police statement said.
   Before the blast, a man jumped out of the car and fled as the
vehicle rolled into an alley toward Shamseddin's 10-story apartment
building, the statement said.
   The car drifted to the left, ``hit a sand rampart roadblock and
exploded,'' causing no casualties, the police statement said.
   Shamseddin, 55, is vice chairman of the Higher Shiite Islamic
Council, the supreme religious body that handles the day-to-day
spiritual affairs of the 1.2 million Shiites who make up Lebanon's
largest sect.
   Shamseddin took over after the council's chairman, Imam Moussa
Sadr, mysteriously disappeared during a visit to Libya in September
1978.
   Police said several parked cars and windows were damaged by the
blast.
   There was no claim of responsibility. Nine car bombs exploded in
Lebanon in 1989, killing 80 people and wounding 342, by police
count.
   Moslem security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said they believe the attack was part of a Shiite power struggle
pitting the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia against the Syrian-backed
Amal.
   Shamseddin, a moderate, supports Amal chieftain Nabih Berri, who
also is minister of water and hydraulic resources in the government.
   Berri is at odds with former Iranian Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, the hard-liner who founded Hezbollah when he was
ambassador in Damascus in the early 1980s.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani dismissed Mohtashemi as
interior minister in August, but Mohtashemi later won election to
Parliament.
   The hard-line leader surfaced in Lebanon late last year and held
talks with officials of Hezbollah, which is believed to be the
umbrella group for Shiite factions holding most of the 18 Western
hostages in Lebanon.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, said Amal and Hezbollah fighters traded gunfire in
south Lebanon's Iqlim al-Tuffah district Saturday, but there were
no casualties.
   By police count, 98 people have been killed and 286 wounded
since the latest Amal-Hezbollah clashes broke out Dec. 23.
   The explosion came a few days after President Elias Hrawi's
government said it had worked out a security plan for west Beirut
calling for the withdrawal of militias.
   The plan was agreed upon during talks between Hrawi and Syrian
President Hafez Assad in Damascus.
   In a news conference with Assad on Tuesday, Hrawi said the plan
would make Beirut an ``oasis of peace.''
   Hrawi leads a Christian-Moslem government that is backed by
Syria, which has the largest military presence in Lebanon.
Christian Gen. Michel Aoun, whose forces control Lebanon's
Christian enclave, refuses to recognize the government and has
vowed to drive the Syrians from Lebanon.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the plan
calls for troops loyal to the government to replace Syrians in most
of the capital's western sector, which is Moslem.
   But both Lebanese and Syrian soldiers will not be deployed in
the heart of south Beirut's slums, where most of the Western
captives, including eight Americans, are believed held, the source
said.

   Dug into trenches and trading cannon

   More accustomed to hit-and-run tactics during a 15-year war,
rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola

Mavinga, which they captured in 1981.
   During the week, Soviet-made jets dropped bombs near villages
and in cornfields around the district, which is home to 20,000
people.
   Mavinga is about 135 miles northwest of Jamba, headquarters of
the guerrilla group known by its Portuguese abbreviation, UNITA.
The guerrillas have been fighting for a share of power since
Marxists took control of the government following independence from
Portugal in 1975.
   UNITA officers say the government launched the offensive last
month to embarrass guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi, on his first
visit to Portugal since independence. Portuguese officials have
agreed to meet Savimbi, although they recognize the Angolan
government.
   ``They wanted to sabotage the trip of our president, to say,
`You're in Portugal, but we're in Mavinga,''' said Gen. Arlindo
Pena Ben-Ben, UNITA's military chief of staff.
   Savimbi postponed his trip, originally set for Jan. 12, to lead
12,000 guerrillas against the offensive. At least 9,000 government
troops accompanied by tanks had driven through 75 miles of
guerrilla-held territory.
   ``At that time, we were not in control of the situation; now we
are,'' said Ben-Ben.
   He said the forces of the government _ known as the Popular
Movement for the Liberation of Angola _ were running low on
supplies, harassed by guerrillas attacking the convoys, and unable
to make accurate bombing runs because of the danger of guerrilla
anti-aircraft missiles supplied by the United States.
   The jets make up to six flights across the river each day at
altitudes of 20,000 feet, dropping two bombs at a time.
   Craters from phosphorous and shrapnel bombs within a few hundred
yards of villages indicate the targets of recent bombing runs.
   A woman who was seven months pregnant lost her baby and suffered
severe cuts when a phosphorous bomb landed outside her house, and
several women were hurt by shrapnel when a bomb landed in a
cornfield, said Lt. Col. Cristiano Sussula.
   ``They were aiming at the villages but flew away because of our
anti-aircraft defense. They had to drop the bombs abruptly,'' said
Sussula.
   The guerrillas say the planes also drop chemical bombs, which
send up a grayish-green smoke. Villagers attracted to the smoke on
Jan. 17 collapsed, coughing, vomiting and losing control of their
bowels when they approached, said doctors at Mavinga.
   Three died in two days, and others were transferred to Jamba for
more sophisticated treatment, doctors said.
   Journalists taken to a site near Mavinga saw a circle of dead
bushes, with leaves turned yellow on the stem. A week after the
bombing, a strong metallic taste lingered in the mouths of those
who went close enough to inhale the air around the site.
   The pounding from multiple-firing cannons, the thuds of mortar
shells and the rumble of tanks reverberate day and night through
the bush.
   Rainy-season offensives are rare in Angola. Ben-Ben said the
government launched this one in desperation, seeking a position of
strength because it is under pressure from other African countries
to negotiate a settlement.
   Savimbi and Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos agreed to a
truce in June, but it collapsed within weeks.
   As of Jan. 10, the guerrillas say they had 46 dead and 149
wounded, and had killed 207 government soldiers, wounded 175 and
injured four Soviet advisers. There are no firm figures on civilian
casualties, but UNITA reported at least 17 deaths and dozens of
injuries from bombs.
   Ben-Ben said Cubans are also participating in the battle, in
small numbers, but he can't prove it unless he captures one. A
Cuban presence in southern Angola would violate a December 1988
agreement with South Africa that calls for all foreign troops to
withdraw from Angola and for South Africa to grant independence to
neighboring Namibia.
   Last week, Cuba suspended the withdrawal of its remaining 19,000
troops out of anger over a guerilla attack that killed four of
them. UNITA said it did not know Cubans would be stationed at the
water purification plant that was attacked.
   UNITA was not a party to the 1988 accord, but Savimbi said last
year his soldiers wouldn't attack retreating Cubans, only those who
continued fighting.

<HEAD>Tight Vote on China Veto Points to More Skirmishing Ahead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fresh from a narrow victory in his first fight
with Congress this year, President Bush returns to Capitol Hill
this week to lay out his policy agenda in an atmosphere that points
to more skirmishing ahead.
   The president won in a showdown with the Democrat-controlled
Senate on Thursday over his policy toward China. But he had just
three votes to spare as he prevented the two-thirds majority needed
to override his veto of legislation shielding Chinese students in
the United States from deportation.
   Following that display of political muscle, Bush will send his
budget proposals to Congress on Monday, then take the podium in the
House chamber on Wednesday night to deliver his first State of the
Union address.
   The $1.2 trillion budget continues Bush's no-new-taxes pledge,
trims Pentagon spending by about 2 percent after inflation and
boosts spending on foreign aid, education, drug programs and the
environment.
   Bush's victory on the China bill came a day after the House
overwhelmingly rejected the veto on a vote of 390 to 25. Taken
together, the votes represent less than an overwhelming endorsement
of Bush's policy and came at considerable political expense to the
president as well as senators who supported him.
   ``We knew this was going to be a tough vote from the time we
asked for it,'' said Janet Mullins, chief State Department
operative on Capitol Hill.
   The China issue returns to the Senate floor briefly this week
when the chamber takes up a bill authorizing activities of the
State Department. It includes a series of trade sanctions aimed at
Beijing.
   The measure is expected to pass easily, and the administration
will not oppose it because the sanctions can be waived if Bush
determines doing so is ``in the national interest.''
   Republicans believe Bush's victory last week stunned Democrats,
even if only briefly, and will dissuade those looking for political
opportunties to embarrass Bush at least in the near term. Bush
himself said the win would ``be helpful in reaching accommodation''
with the Senate and House on other matters.
   But the president was able to win only after several days of
intense lobbying that included personal appeals and entreaties to
party solidarity. Much of the debate in the Senate focused not on
the merits of the legislation, but on whether Congress was
wrongfully trying to wrest away Bush's foreign-policy role.
   It is an election year, as well, and Congress will be looking
impatiently for the payoff from Bush's low-key efforts to coax
China's government into moderation.
   Without a major new gesture or concession from Beijing, two
enduring television images will remain in lawmakers' minds,
lawmakers believe.
   One is the student standing in front of a line of four tanks in
Tiananmen Square before the June 4 crackdown and National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft toasting the leaders who sent in the tanks.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said last week's
skirmish amounted to the ``opening day of the 1990 election
season'' and surmised that the vote to uphold the Bush veto will be
used against Republicans in 30-second Democratic political spots
come campaign time.
   On his overall agenda before Congress, Bush will be hoping to
fare better than he did last year, when he recorded unusually low
overall support scores in Congress for a honeymooning first-year
president.
   A suvery by the journal Congressional Quarterly found that Bush
got his way just 63 percent of the time in 1989, the second-lowest
first-year success rate since the publication began compiling
statistics in 1953. Only President Ford was lower, with a 58
percent rate in the Watergate year of 1974.

<HEAD>`Soft Money' Seeps Through Cracks in Campaign Law at Record Pace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Soft money,'' the kind that seeps through
the limits in federal election campaign laws, flourished as never
before in the 1988 presidential race, a new survey shows.
   And the results support claims by critics that many wealthy
donors contributed the money with an eye to helping the
presidential candidates of their choice, thus getting around
restrictions imposed by federal law.
   Federal law limits the size of individual contributions made to
candidates but puts no restriction on the size of ``soft''
donations designed to help state party organizations register
voters and similar activities.
   The Center for Responsive Politics sent its questionnaires to
donors of soft money identified by the parties. Only 19 responded,
a small fraction.
   Eleven said their primary aim was support of presidential
candidates.
   Contributors were promised confidentiality in the survey last
year and its results have not previously been released.
   The center, a private bipartisan group that wants soft money
contributions brought under federal control, made copies of the
questionnaires available to The Associated Press after deleting the
donors' names.
   Soft money may not legally be used in campaigns for federal
office. Critics, however, say it was widely used by both parties in
1988 to evade the contribution limits and pump large amounts into
key presidential states.
   Figures on exactly how much soft money was contributed are not
available. The center, basing its figures on public disclosures by
the two national parties, has used a total of $45 million.
   But that was brought into question by its own survey of reports
filed under state disclosure laws in nine presidential battleground
states, which counted money received by state parties through their
national committees and in direct donations. That survey showed
$28.5 million in those states alone.
   The Democratic National Committee said it received $11.6 million
in soft money in the three months before the election and disbursed
$15.7 million.
   One donor, who gave $100,000 to the Democratic National
Committee, told the center he was asked to contribute by Dukakis or
his fundraisers and intended his money to be used to support the
national Democratic ticket.
   He said he had no intention of contributing to other activities,
such as voter registration or get-out-the-vote drives. Others,
donors of between $35,000 and $100,000 excluded from federal
limits, gave similar answers.
   Eight of those responding said they did want their contributions
to be used for such activities.
   Thirteen of the donors said public disclosure of soft
contributions should be required by law. Several also said they
should be prohibited or restricted.
   Fifteen gave to the Democratic party and four to the Republican
party.
   Fund-raisers for both parties defend their role in soliciting
soft money during the presidential campaign season.
   ``I refuse to apologize for trying to create a level playing
field in 1988 for the first time with the Republicans,'' said
Robert Farmer, treasurer of the Democratic National Committee. He
said Republicans outspent Democrats heavily in the 1984 campaign
through use of soft money.
   ``I do not kid myself,'' Farmer said in an interview. ``The
reason such a flood of money comes in is because of the
high-profile nature of a presidential campaign. But I think the use
of the money is very clear. The fact of the matter is the money is
used for party building activities.''
   Farmer said party fundraisers working for Dukakis told him in
the heat of the campaign that ``we really need help in a key state
or two and if you are talking to anybody important and can
encourage them to give directly to that state, that would be
helpful.''
   ``I know that some people were encouraged to give directly to
state parties at the end,'' Farmer said.
   Former Republican National Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf said, ``The
Democrats never had done it before 1988. The reason they did it was
pretty clearly that they wanted to impact the presidential race. We
had done it every year. It has an incidental benefit to the
presidential campaign, even though it is not designed that way.''
   ``Anyone who followed what I did knows that my entire focus was
to build the local parties,'' Fahrenkopf said. ``But you are never
going to convince the people who believe it that every nickel of
soft money isn't just a circuitous way to aid the presidential
campaign.''
   Congress is considering campaign reform legislation as part of
the agenda for its forthcoming session.
   ``I think the House and Senate are going to pass campaign
finance bills and I think as part of them we are going to deal with
soft money,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, the
self-styled citizens lobby that advocates federal controls.
   Ellen S. Miller, director of the Center for Responsive Politics,
said she did not ``think the political signs are as optimistic as
Common Cause thinks. Members are so relucant to change a system
that benefits them in so many ways.''
   The Federal Election Commission will meet Jan. 24 to consider
new rules for allocating funds between state and national party
committees in presidential election years. Common Cause seeks to
have the FEC tighten its regulations, and the agency was ordered by
a federal judge last year to speed up action on the matter.
   A group of grass roots political activists, many of them
veterans of the nuclear freeze movement, are also getting into the
act. The Study Group on Electoral Democracy, based in Deerfield,
Mass., will hold a conference Feb. 2-4 in Waveland, Miss., to
explore ways of generating public interest in campaign reform.
   Randy Kehler, former national coordinator for the nuclear freeze
proponents, said, ``The question is: can this issue, which tends to
be complex, boring, removed from everyday life, for most people, be
made into an issue that a significant number of the American people
can care about?''

<HEAD>Storm Becomes Political Issue in Britain; Cleanup Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cleanup from a devastating storm that killed
95 people in Europe has barely begun, but weather forecasting has
already become a political issue in Britain.
   Opposition politicians accuse the government of failing to give
enough publicity to forecasts of Thursday's storm, which caused 46
deaths and an estimated $1.6 billion damage in Britain.
   Official reports said another 19 people died in Holland, 10 in
Belgium, eight in France, seven in West Germany, four in Denmark
and one in East Germany.
   The storm, with winds up to 110 mph, knocked out power and
communications in large areas of Britain and the Continent,
severely disrupted transportation and uprooted millions of trees.
   ``If we see the kind of hurricane warnings that occur off the
coast of the United States, the way that people are alerted, the
way that dangerous structures are shored up, the way that people
are warned in terms of transport or getting people off early, we
can see a very big difference indeed,'' David Blunkett, a lawmaker
from the opposition Labor Party, said in an interview carried
Saturday by BBC radio.
   On Friday night, a group of Labor parliamentarians submitted a
motion in the House of Commons condemning the government's response
to the storm.
   ``When a storm of that magnitude threatens all or major parts of
the country, the government has a duty to ensure that full and
frequent warnings are carried on TV and radio. It is deplorable
that the government completely failed to do this,'' the motion said.
   Unlike the detailed weather forecasts featured on U.S.
television, British TV seldom devotes more than a minute to a
climate that generally drones along between warm and cool, and
usually wet.
   Roger Hunt of the Meteorological Office said the storm was
accurately forecast, but the problem was getting people to pay
attention.
   ``We would like to get to the position where at least the public
didn't travel as much as they might otherwise have done if we issue
a warning to the effect that we expect driving conditions to be
extremely hazardous,'' said Hunt.
   That, he said, may take ``a good few years of education.''
   Speaking in the House of Commons on Friday, Local Government
Minister David Hunt insisted that the government responded
``swiftly and immediately.''
   ``I understand all affected police forces issued, through the
media, warnings about the dangers of travel,'' he said.
   The storm moved across the Baltic on Friday and into the Soviet
republics of Lithuania and Latvia, where it tapered off.
   Forecasters said another severe storm was expected to hit
Ireland and Britain on Monday, but winds were not expected to
exceed 60 mph.
   As the cleanup continued Saturday, BBC TV said 200,000 customers
were still without electricity. The Forestry Commission estimated
that 3 million trees were down.
   French Coast Guard aircraft resumed a search off the Brittany
coast for the five crew members of the trawler La Fayette, which
sent a distress signal Thursday and has not been seen since then.
   Belgian insurance companies estimated Saturday that damage from
the storm will exceed $79 million in their country.
   Insurers in Denmark estimated that damage there would total
$19.2 million.
   East Germany's one fatality was in the southern city of
Karl-Marx-Stadt, where a man was fatally injured when his motor
scooter hit a tree uprooted by the storm.

<HEAD>Judge: Bowlers Tour Discriminated Over Man's Pony Tail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Amateur Bowlers Tour unlawfully
discriminated against a Chippewa Indian by barring him from a
tournament because of his long hair worn in a pony tail, a judge
has ruled.
   Ramsey County District Judge Roland Faricy on Friday ruled in
favor of Joe Big Bear of St. Paul and turned down the tour's appeal
of a decision by the St. Paul Human Rights Commission.
   In September, the commission said the tour discriminated against
Big Bear on the basis of sex and awarded him $3,000 in damages. The
commission also ordered the tour to pay $1,300 in costs incurred by
the city in investigating and prosecuting Big Bear's complaint.
   Big Bear ran afoul of a rule that male bowlers cannot have hair
below the bottom of the ``normal collar'' and cannot wear braids,
ponytails, hair curlers, head bands or hats. The commission noted
that there were no rules governing the length of the hair of female
entrants.
   The tour's attorneys contended that it is not a ``public
accommodation,'' in which the law forbids discrimination, because
it is selective in admitting members. Faricy rejected the argument,
noting that the competition excludes only very high-scoring bowlers
from amateur status.
   With the support of its co-sponsor Bud Light beer, the tour has
paid more than $40 million in prizes to bowlers since 1977.
   Questioning the tour's argument that its grooming standards are
necessary to attract sponsors, Faricy cited a Bud Light commercial
in which two men are captured by an army of scantily clad Amazons.
They discover they cannot leave but are told they will get an
unlimited supply of Bud Light.
   ``If that level of bad taste, sexism and excess is acceptable to
Bud Light,'' he wrote, ``perhaps the Amateur Bowlers Tour does not
need to worry about establishing very high standards for its
members.''

   Reinforced concrete slabs from the Berlin
Wall should be used for building silos and dung storage containers,
the East German farmers' party said Saturday.
   Prized wall graffiti would not have to vanish if the concrete
were put to such use, the Democratic Peasant Party's official
newspaper said.
   ``Valuable paintings would certainly face outward and would thus
be maintained for future generations,'' the paper said. ``Why
shouldn't villages also have such a tourist attraction?''
   Since Communist authorities opened the wall Nov. 9 after 28
years, East German officials have said the border barrier will be
dismantled and sold by the slab to foreigners paying hard currency.
   East German border guards removed a first 320-yard stretch of
the 100-mile wall in West Berlin last week and carted the pieces
off to a depot.
   The farmers' party is one of several small parties that was
aligned with the Communists during their 40-year hold on power
before the fall pro-democracy revolution.
   Despite the dismantled wall's suitability to agrarian uses,
farmers are not likely to be able to compete with cash-bearing
Westerners who have been paying as much as $29,000 for slabs from
the infamous Cold War symbol.

<HEAD>Pope Urges Respect for Human Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Saturday urged
rejection of ideologies and respect for human rights as he came to
this poor Marxist-oriented country on his African pilgrimage.
   The pontiff said the church realized the difficulties of trying
to find the best political system to improve living conditions in
Guinea-Bissau, one of the world's 15 poorest countries.
   The average life expectency in this former Portuguese colony on
the West African coast is 39, the lowest in the world, and annual
per capita income is around $190.
   In an airport speech after his arrival on the second leg of his
eight-day tour of the Sahel region, the pope said the ``pillars of
a truly human model of society'' should be freedom, justice and
fundamental rights.
   The pope criticized education based on ideology. Vatican
officials said this was in reference to complaints by the local
church that the one-party state imposes Marxist-oriented teaching
in schools.
   John Paul said education should be ``global,'' cautioning
against teaching that turns students into objects and leads them to
``uncontrolled productionism, guided only by national interests''
   ``In such cases, you run the risk of evasion and the search for
escape, perhaps in violence, with all its evils,'' he said,
speaking in Portuguese.
   ``I pray that the education process here has complete success,
starting with a real literacy campaign.''
   The pope arrived in Bissau in sunshine and sweltering heat, a
striking contrast with the rain and wind that marked his two days
in the barren Cape Verde islands.
   The pope later addressed clergy in the Bissau cathedral and
celebrated Mass at the Sept. 24 stadium, named after the date in
1973 when the country gained independence.
   In his homily during the Mass, John Paul made another reference
to Marxist ideology, saying people should be spared from
``everything which seeks to crush or eliminate them in the
anonymity of collectivity.''
   He said the local church promotes ``the fundamental rights of
man'' and rejection ``of static and conditioning ideologies.''
   ``Be vigilant and don't let yourselves be won over by the
temptations of corruption and abuse of power and wealth,'' he told
the faithful.
   Touching on a common theme of his papacy, John Paul warned
against materialism, consumerism and forms of development that
``favor a mere expansion of technologies for economic growth.''
   Despite the church-state dispute over education, the government
of President Joao Bernado Vieira, who took power in a 1980 coup,
has sought to shed some of its Marxist practices.
   It has liberalized the economy, lifting price controls and trade
restrictions at the behest of the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund.
   In its latest report, the human rights organization Amnesty
International accused the government of holding about 30 political
prisoners in connection with an alleged 1985 plot to overthrow
Vieira. The report said they had received an unfair trial.
   In what was seen as a gesture to the pope, the government last
week freed 16 people who were convicted in the alleged conspiracy.
   Six others convicted in the same case were executed in July
1986, despite pleas for clemency from the pope and others.
   Guinea-Bissau, sandwiched between Senegal and Guinea on the
Atlantic coast, is one of the smallest countries in Africa,
covering 14,000 square miles.
   About 7 percent of the population of 950,000 is Roman Catholic.
More than 50 percent are animists and one-third are Moslems.
   The pope leaves Sunday for Mali, then heads to Burkina Faso and
Chad.

   A mild earthquake struck near this southern
Indiana community Saturday as an aftershock from a quake Wednesday,
but there were no reports of damage or injuries, authorities said.
   The quake measuring 3.5 on the Richter scale struck at 9:06 a.m.
and was centered 30 miles west of Louisville, Ky., the National
Earthquake Information Center reported.
   The quake was felt in Crawford and Perry counties in southern
Indiana and in Kentucky's Hancock County, said Pat Jorgenson, a
spokeswoman for the Golden, Colo.-based center.
   She said more aftershocks from the 3.8 quake Wednesday were
possible in the region, which lies over several faults.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause
slight damage in the local area.

<HEAD>Thirtieth Anniversary of Woolworth Sit-Ins Commemorated</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Joe Poole stood in the rain outside the
downtown Woolworth store and recalled what it was like in 1960 for
a black man to try to get a meal at some lunch counters in the
South.
   ``There was a time when they wouldn't wait on you,'' said Poole,
who is 85. ``We've come a long way, but it won't be perfect until
we get to heaven.''
   Thursday will be the 30th anniversary of sit-ins, which began
when four freshmen from then-all-black North Carolina Agricultural
and Technical College sat at the Woolworth store's whites-only
lunch counter and asked for service.
   Their refusal to leave when they were denied service sparked
similar sit-ins at other segregated lunch counters and helped
established passive resistance as a tool of the 1960s civil rights
movement.
   The state since has erected a historical marker at the site and,
on Wednesday, Greensboro begins five days of activities
commemorating the anniversary with a panel discussion at the
University of North Carolina-Greensboro.
   ``Not only was the South in for a time of change; more
important, the terms of that change would no longer be dictated by
white Southerners,'' wrote William H. Chafe, a Duke University
historian, in his 1980 book, ``Civilities and Civil Rights.''
   When the four students _ David Richmond, Franklin McCain, Ezell
Blair Jr. and Joseph McNeil _ planned the sit-in, Greensboro was a
segregated city.
   Public buildings had separate water fountains for whites and
blacks. Theaters had separate entrances for blacks, who were forced
to sit in balconies. Blacks also were required to step to the rear
on city buses.
   The first sit-in will be re-enacted at 7:30 a.m. Thursday. A
plaque and footprints will be dedicated in front of the store and a
sculpture will be unveiled at North Carolina A&amp;T State University.
   All four demonstrators are expected to attend the celebration,
which will include symposiums, an awards banquet, a performance of
Alice Walker's ``Down A Lonesome Road,'' and a jazz concert
featuring Dizzy Gillespie.
   Before going to Woolworth on Feb. 1, 1960, the four students
agreed they would be courteous and would not miss any classes. They
also agreed it would be a non-violent demonstration.
   They targeted Woolworth because it was a national chain that
allowed its lunch counters to be segregated only in the South.
   ``We fully talked about the prospect of going to jail,'' McCain
said in an interview five years ago. ``In fact, we didn't think
we'd come back to campus.''
   They were allowed to go back to school, and news about the
sit-in flashed across campus. The next day, more than two dozen
male and female students showed up at the lunch counter. They, too,
were denied service.
   On the third day, the demonstrations spread to the Kress
five-and-dime store down the street. The sit-ins quickly became
national news.
   Gov. Luther Hodges called the sit-ins ``counterproductive'' and
a threat to law and order. Soon, crowds began gathering to watch
the students. Hecklers _ including Ku Klux Klansmen _ taunted the
students.
   The sit-ins quickly spread to other North Carolina cities.
   ``One week to the day after the demonstrations had started in
Greensboro, black students in Winston-Salem and Durham held sit-ins
at local lunch counters,'' Chafe wrote. ``The next day
demonstrations began in Charlotte, and the day after that in
Raleigh. By the end of the week students were sitting-in across the
state.''
   Restaurant owners resisted efforts to persuade them to change
their policy, saying they feared integration would drive away white
customers.
   On July 25, 1960, nearly six months after the first sit-in,
Woolworth agreed to allow blacks at the lunch counter. Later
accounts reported the chain lost about $200,000 in business during
the sit-ins.
   Today, the lunch counter looks about the same as it did in the
30-year-old news photographs, but black and white customers sit
side by side on red vinyl seats, eating and talking about sports
and events of the day.
   ``It's the way it should be,'' said one white customer, Mary Lou
Nelson.

   An 11-year-old girl who recanted
testimony that she was raped by her mother's boyfriend had
fabricated her story after watching a television police drama,
lawyers said.
   Her testimony, given when she was 9, helped convict Ivie Cornell
Norris, who spent 513 days in Pinellas County Jail and could have
faced life behind bars. The girl recanted Friday and Norris is a
free man.
   ``He didn't do it,'' she told Circuit Judge Raymond Ulmer Jr.,
her voice barely audible, her eyes downcast. Prosecutors then asked
that the case be thrown out.
   ``I thank the Lord this kid came up and told the truth,'' a
teary-eyed Norris, 55, said as he left court.
   ``I can't understand it,'' the child's mother said. ``She
convinced me. She convinced a jury. She convinced my parents. She
went through the whole bit.''
   Attorneys in the case said the girl based her testimony on an
episode of the television drama ``21 Jump Street'' that depicted a
rape case.
   Her mother told the judge that the girl admitted a couple of
months ago she had fabricated the story with the idea of getting
Norris out of the way because the couple fought ``and she just
wanted him away from me.''
   Mary C. Orendorf, a juror at Norris' trial, recalled Friday how
the girl's credibility was the central issue during four hours of
deliberations at the trial in 1988. There was no physical evidence,
she said, only the girl's word.
   ``We really went over it and over it to see, `Is she making this
up? Is she telling the truth?','' Ms. Orendorf said.
   On the stand, the girl appeared calm, even a little timid, she
recalled. ``It just didn't seem like she was lying.''
   Investigators with the state Department of Health and
Rehabilitative Services were asked to assess the girl's claims
shortly after she reported the attack. They, too, believed her, but
noted there was no medical confirmation.
   According to the trial testimony, the alleged attack took place
in March 1988 soon after the girl's mother entered the hospital for
a three-week treatment for cocaine addiction and left the girl with
Norris.
   Norris was found guilty Nov. 9, 1988, but won a new trial on the
grounds that his attorneys should be allowed to cross-examine the
girl about her claim of molestation by another of her mother's
boyfriends.
   The second trial was set to begin earlier this month. That's
when the child's mother first told prosecutors for the first time
that her daughter had recanted the rape story.
   Some jurors said the fact Norris didn't take the stand in his
own defense, an option guaranteed defendants under the
Constitution, worked against him. Assistant Public Defender Scott
Schiltz said keeping Norris off the stand was a tactical move he
now regrets.
   ``When you get a defendant on the stand you just don't know what
they're going to say,'' the attorney said.
   Norris said his time behind bars cost him his job, friends and
time with his son. ``I lost everything,'' he said.
   He said he bears no anger toward the girl, only saying, ``She's
a good liar, always was.''

   Two people have been arrested in the
killing of the American finance director of the Panama Canal
Commission, police announced Saturday.
   William Joyce was shot in his home Tuesday by an intruder.
   Joyce, 56, was taken to the U.S. military's Gorgas Hospital and
died early Wednesday. The two hooded burglars took money and
jewelry from Joyce's home. Police said they had recovered the
jewelry.
   Joyce was the fourth-highest official of the nine-member
commission, which runs the Panama Canal.
   Leslie Loaiza, police director, told reporters Saturday that
19-year-old Rafael Palma Ricaurter and an unidentified minor had
been arrested in connection with the case.
   Loaiza said the minor told authorities he shot Joyce in the
abdomen because ``he didn't want to sit down.''
   The minor also is wanted by Interpol authorities in neighboring
Costa Rica on suspicion of assaulting and killing a Costa Rican law
enforcement agent, Loaiza said.
   Following the shooting, the U.S. Southern Command said Thursday
that it was increasing its military patrols in an effort to check a
crime wave sweeping the capital and surrounding areas.

   Rocky Balboa, filmdom's most famous boxer,
ran up the great stone steps of the Philadelphia Art Museum on
Saturday for what may be the last time.
   ``I think this is the final chapter. My legs are going,'' joked
actor Sylvester Stallone during a break in filming ``Rocky V.''
   Stallone, who was a near-unknown when he first played the boxer
who rose from the slums of Philadelphia to become world champion,
said his next challenge would be ``getting down the steps without
falling.'' He's 43.
   Stallone and his crew filmed what he called the ``turning
point'' in his latest ``Rocky'' film at dawn Saturday. The
actor-filmmaker promises it will be ``an awe-inspiring segment.''
   The original ``Rocky,'' winner of the 1976 Academy Award for
best picture, showed Philadelphia's cityscape to millions as boxer
Rocky Balboa trained by running through the city's Italian Market
and up the steps of the museum.
   The city figured less prominently in three sequels, and none of
``Rocky IV'' was filmed here. By contrast, filming for ``Rocky V''
began Jan. 10 and is expected to last about six weeks in
Philadelphia.
   Stallone said that while Rocky represents a fantasy for
everyone, the role remains intensely personal for him.
   ``It's a time when I reflect on my life,'' he said. ``My life
has been facing an uphill climb and when I get to the steps it's a
very humbling experience. I mean, I really did make it, but it's
very easy to fall down again.''
   Stallone and the city have ended an 8-year-old dispute over a
10-foot bronze statue of Rocky that he left atop the Art Museum
steps in 1982.
   The statue was returned earlier this month for the filming after
museum officials got a written contract assuring them that the
bronze would be returned to the Spectrum, the city's indoor sports
arena.
   The last time the statue stood in front of the museum, officials
spent $12,000 to move it, saying the statue wasn't art.
   Stallone has said little about the sequel's script, which he
wrote.
   ``Rocky V,'' with a $40 million budget, is said to have
heavyweight champion Balboa retiring from the ring and running the
gym where he once trained. He takes under his wing an ex-convict,
to be played by boxer Tommy Morrison, 20, a great-grandnephew of
the late John Wayne.
   Talia Shire is back as Rocky's wife and Burt Young again
portrays Rocky's brother-in-law. And John Avildsen, director of the
original movie, is back behind the megaphone.
   The film is to be released in November.

   Balloons wafted skyward and
helicopters hovered overhead Saturday as a colorful caravan of
camels, cars and a horse-drawn cart kicked off a Middle East
campaign against drugs.
   Saudis in the parking lot of the Malaz Sports Stadium cheered as
the caravan began its five-day tour of the capital. It is to
continue on to 11 other Saudi cities and then begin touring other
Arab countries in the region.
   The Riyadh vice governor, Prince Sattam, and U.S. Ambassador
Charles W. Freeman Jr. took part in the festivities.
   The 600-yard caravan is made up of five trucks, 25 sedans, an
armored vehicle, a horse-drawn cart carrying a marching band, eight
camels and police cars.
   The stadium parking lot was filled with white tents containing
visual displays, books, stickers, and pamphlets on drug abuse. The
U.S. Information Service helped provide anti-drug leaflets for the
helicopters to drop.
   Helium-filled balloons, brightly colored flags and streamers
brightened the atmosphere. Helicopters circled overhead.
   Leaflets will be distributed to the public, and theatrical
events, with drug abuse as the main them, will be performed by
Saudi actors.
   While Saudi Arabia's drug problem is minor in comparison to most
Western countries, the kingdom has responded swiftly to curtail
drug imports. Three years ago, King Fahd issued a royal decree
mandating the death penalty for drug smugglers.
   Since then, 21 people have been publicly beheaded for drug
offenses and, according to the National Commission for Combating
Drugs, drug abuse and trafficking have decreased by 50 percent.
   ``The decision to execute drug smugglers has had a major
impact,'' said Maj. Gen. Ibrahim al-Maiman, acting director of the
commission.
   In interviews with local press, al-Maiman has expressed hope
that the caravan, organized by his office, will help educate Saudi
citizens about drugs.
   ``Parades, festivals, shows, competitions and gifts will ensure
bigger attendance to the caravan and will hence enable us to
distribute more pamphlets and books against drugs,'' said al-Maiman.

   Iron bars parted and Bishop Austin Vaughan
walked out of the Albany County Jail last week to hugs, applause
and even an autograph seeker. Anti-abortion crusaders had a new
hero.
   Vaughan, a 62-year-old auxiliary bishop of the Roman Catholic
New York Archdiocese, had served a 15-day sentence for blocking the
entrance of a Planned Parenthood office in a protest organized by
Operation Rescue.
   But what Vaughan said while in jail attracted far more attention
than what he did to get there.
   The bishop said Gov. Mario Cuomo risked going to hell for his
pro-choice views. Vaughan described the New York Democrat as a
``Sunday Catholic'' who has done more than anybody in the state to
promote abortion. And Vaughan said he'd be happy to see Cuomo
excommunicated from the church.
   Cuomo, considered a potential 1992 Democratic presidential
candidate, has said he accepts the church's teaching on abortion in
his personal life, but that abortion is a matter of a woman's own
conscience. He budgets about $15 million a year in state funds to
pay for abortions for poor women. He received warm ovations for a
speech at a pro-choice conference last week.
   The governor, who termed Vaughan's remarks ``intemperate,'' said
he'll eventually be judged by a ``higher and wiser power.''
   Vaughan's colleagues haven't rushed to his defense.
   Bishop Francis Mugavero, head of the Brooklyn Diocese, said
Vaughan's statement that Cuomo risks eternal damnation ``troubles
me.''
   ``I do not think that we are in the position to judge the final
punishment a person will receive because of that individual's
actions in this life,'' Mugavero said. ``We must leave that
judgment in the hands of a merciful God.''
   Bishop Edward Head of the Buffalo Diocese said he doesn't want
to debate an individual's ``personal relationship with God'' in
public. But Head said he cannot accept Cuomo's stand on abortion.
   Cardinal John O'Connor, Vaughan's boss, said he'd withhold
comment until he spoke to the auxiliary bishop. An O'Connor
spokesman said he didn't know when that would happen.
   Vaughan said he understands why other church leaders have been
reluctant to make such public warnings, but he's not backing down.
   When he left jail Wednesday morning, five friends were there to
applaud him. One wore a silver pin of tiny baby's feet on his
lapel. Another asked Vaughan to autograph a copy of the New York
Post front-page with its headline: ``Jailed Bishop to Cuomo: You're
Risking Hell.''
   Vaughan taught theology for nearly 20 years at St. Joseph
Seminary in Yonkers and became a bishop in 1977. As an auxiliary
bishop, he serves as an assistant to O'Connor and has been assigned
as pastor of St. Patrick's Church in Newburgh.
   His activism, he said, began when he noticed none of the
candidates in the 1988 New York Democratic presidential primary
were addressing the abortion issue.
   He joined Operation Rescue, and has since served separate
two-day jail sentences for trespassing at abortion clinics in
Pennsylvania and Westchester County. With time off for good
behavior, he had to spend 10 days behind bars in Albany.
   Vaughan is one of two Catholic bishops who have been jailed for
participation in Operation Rescue demonstrations, said Barbara
Duffy, a spokeswoman for the organization.
   Vaughan said does not encourage his parishioners to risk arrest
with Operation Rescue, but he wants them to put ``justifiable
pressure'' on public officials.
   One of the state's leading pro-choice activists predicted the
church would seek to dissociate itself from Vaughan's statements to
head off a backlash similar to what happened last fall when San
Diego's bishop refused to give communion to a pro-choice California
state Senate candidate. She went on to win the election.
   ``I bet they're going to run for cover,'' said Shirley Gordon,
executive director of the Family Planning Advocates of New York
state.
   Vaughan said it's never been Catholic custom to publicly warn
politicians of their potential fate for espousing pro-choice views.
   ``By hindsight, it's a mistake,'' he said. ``But I'm not
surprised if other bishops don't jump on the bandwagon and go along
with that. The fact that this is now an issue of public discussion,
the very circumstances are going to force bishops to face up to
whether or not this is the direction they want to go in. I'm not
sure what they're going to say on that.''

<HEAD>U.S. Will Have to Back German Reunification, Kissinger Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
says the United States will have to support reunification of the
two Germanies, despite hopes to the contrary on the part of Soviet
leaders.
   ``The secret dream of the Soviet Union is that we will prevent
the unification of Germany,'' Kissinger said in a interview taped
for airing Sunday on NBC television's ``John McLaughlin's One on
One.''
   The German-born Kissiner said he personally would have been
satisfied if the reunification issue ``had not come up in my
lifetime.''
   ``But it has come up, and it has come up in a way that makes it
unavoidable, and it makes it important for the United States to get
behind it, or else German nationalism is going to turn against the
United States,'' he said.
   Kissinger said ``visible major steps will be taken within two
years'' toward German unification.
   After upcoming elections, East Germany is likely to follow
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland in requesting withdrawal of
Soviet forces from its territory, Kissinger said.
   He urged demilitarizing East Germany and creating a nonaligned
military status like that of Austria for ``former satellite
states.''
   He said East Germany will come under intense pressure to raise
its economic level to that of West Germany or lose much of its
population through the open border. This will mean forming a
``common economic unit'' with West Germany, Kissinger said.
   Kissinger predicted that a unified Germany ``economically ...
will tilt West,'' while militarily the new situation will require
complex arms talks.
   ``I do not agree that you can demilitarize a whole country of
the size and economic potential of the Federal Republic _ of all of
Germany, of some 80 million people,'' he said.
   He said the ``most dangerous situation for both East and West
would be to have a neutral Germany unattached to anybody, because
that would restore European politics to what it was before the two
World Wars of a Germany looking for its own security entirely to
itself in the center of the European continent.''
   Kissinger gave Gorbachev ``at best'' a 50-50 chance to survive
the nationality and other crises threatening his rule. The Kremlin
leader's greatest assets, he said, are that ``he has established an
extraordinary position in the outside world, and secondly the mess
inside the Soviet Union is so great that no alternative leader
wants to take over.''
   Kissinger said in a TV interview earlier this month Gorbachev
might survive secession of the Baltic states but not the loss of
more central Soviet republics now shaken by an upsurge of
nationalism.
   He said the Kremlin currently is using more force than needed to
quell clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in the Soviet
Union's southern republic of Azerbaijan.
   Kissinger said the ``real motive for the massive Soviet
intervention is to keep Azerbaijan in the Soviet Union ... to
demonstrate that the center cannot be defied with impunity.''

<TEXT>
   Trial begins Tuesday in a unique race
discrimination case with legal and social implications: A black
woman fired by the IRS is suing her boss, a darker-skinned black
woman, claiming discrimination because of color.
   Tracy Lynn Morrow would become the first black worker to collect
damages from a black supervisor because of skin-shade
discrimination, according to her attorney and federal equal
opportunity officials.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Moye ruled last spring that such
light vs. dark, black-on-black discrimination is possible and that
the issue should be decided in court.
   Ms. Morrow contends that she was targeted for harassment because
of her skin tone. Her boss, Ruby Lewis, contends that Ms. Morrow _
then Tracy Lynn Walker _ was error-prone, belligerent, frequently
late and dishonest.
   Ms. Morrow, a former Internal Revenue Service temporary employee
in Seattle, was hired in Atlanta as a clerk-typist in 1985. She
entered probation for a permanent position on Dec. 9, 1985, but was
fired on March 14, 1986.
   A race relations expert in Atlanta, Charles King, believes Ms.
Morrow will have a tough time proving discrimination because both
sides acknowledge the position eventually was filled with another
black woman.
   ``The whole thing is lamentable, that the courts would accept
this as discrimination,'' said King, nationally known for his
confrontational race relations seminars. ``To me, it's interesting,
but logistically and logically, there's no case.''
   Ms. Morrow's attorney, Stephen Katz, disagrees. The judge, he
noted, has already ascertained that Ms. Morrow is a member of what
is known in the law as a ``protected class.'' Now, he said, she
must prove that she was improperly replaced by someone outside the
protected class, or show direct evidence of discrimination.
   Katz declined to discuss his evidence before trial, but said he
is confident he can prove discrimination. The non-jury trial is
expected to take about four days.
   Ms. Lewis and Ms. Morrow's earlier boss, a white woman, Virginia
Fite, gave depositions indicating Ms. Morrow was repeatedly cited
for tardiness and poor work.
   Ms. Fite said the employee showed an ``inability to write,'' had
a ``stubborn or immature'' attitude and prompted the personnel
office to report ``she was driving them crazy'' complaining about
things. Her work was ``just adequate,'' Ms. Fite said.
   Ms. Lewis contended that Ms. Morrow ``became more demanding''
after she was made a permanent employee, made increasing errors
amid a ``further deterioration of attitude and conduct'' after a
leave request was denied, and finally lied about crucial mistakes
she had made.
   Ms. Lewis said she has never been prejudiced on the grounds of
race or color. Ms. Fite backed her up, saying Ms. Lewis was ``not
someone who would discriminate for any reason, and certainly not
for race.''
   And Ms. Lewis said she never regarded Ms. Morrow as fair-skinned
anyway _ rather as ``medium brown,'' the same as she is.
   Katz said Ms. Morrow would prefer not to discuss the case before
trial. But he said he would show the unfavorable reviews of Ms.
Morrow's job performance are not accurate.
   Ms. Morrow is seeking reinstatement and up to $60,000 in back
pay and other payments. She has since found employment with a car
rental agency but would prefer to resume her job in government,
Katz said.
   ``It's good work if you can get it,'' he said.
   The judge, in certifying the case for trial, said there is
``evidence that Ms. Lewis might have harbored resentful feelings
towards white people, and therefore by inference, possibly towards
light-skinned black people.''
   King said black-on-black discrimination ``has its basis in
blacks adapting white institutional attitudes and behavior
patterns. It's not that blacks are discriminating against blacks,
but they try to conform to white standards and procedures.
   ``Also, there is a class struggle within the black race, based
upon complexion,'' he said. He said darker complexioned blacks may
transmit hostility they have toward white people toward
light-complexioned blacks who display ``conformity to white
behavioral patterns.''

<TEXT>
   Budget Director Richard G. Darman will liken
the federal budget to a voracious ``Cookie Monster'' in a fanciful
message to Congress that also will warn lawmakers against expecting
a ``peace dividend'' from reduced tensions in Eastern Europe.
   ``The budget, for all its intimidating detail might be seen ...
as the Ultimate Cookie Monster,'' Darman will assert in an
introduction to Bush's $1.2 trillion fiscal 1991 budget.
   ``Its excess tendencies toward consumption are not exactly
ennobling. ... But at the same time, its underlying motivation is
clearly not malevolent. What harm it might cause is largely
unintended,'' Darman writes.
   Darman, in the introduction to be formally released with the
budget on Monday, tells Congress that the job of responsible public
officials is to seek to get the cookie monster under control.
   Darman also will caution lawmakers against seeking a
``wonderland'' in which military savings can be diverted to
domestic programs.
   ``The near-term `peace dividend' is likely to be smaller than
commonly assumed,'' Darman says in his introduction.
   Some members of Congress have proposed that the reductions in
military tensions in Eastern Europe can be turned into a so-called
peace dividend and spent on expanding social programs.
   Darman, however, tells Congress it would be ``naively euphoric''
to expect that the crumbling of the Soviet empire will spell a
final end to East-West tensions.
   Still, Bush's budget will propose an austere $292.1 billion in
Pentagon spending for the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1,
representing the lowest increase in more than a decade and an
actual reduction of about 2 percent if inflation is taken into
account, according to administration sources.
   Excerpts from Darman's introduction were first published in
Saturday's editions of The New York Times and later confirmed by
administration officials.
   Darman asserts that the ``great historical shift'' in Eastern
Europe ``has been almost trivialized in its translation into public
debate about the budget. The issue has been framed as ``how big is
the peace dividend'' and, in effect, ``how can I get mine?''
   He said the prime objective of the budget was not to find other
ways of spending military savings, but ``how can it best preserve
and build on America's strengths.''
   Darman asks in his partly whimsical introduction: ``How big is
the deficit?'' And, paraphrasing Elizabeth Barrett Browning, he
answers the question: ``Let me count the ways.''
   Darman also will tell Congress that many programs in the budget
are like the hungry monsters in ``Pac Man'' the popular video game,
``waiting to spring forward and consume another line of resources
dots in the budget maze.''
   But, then he adds: ``At some point, it is appropriate to put
games aside _ at least for a while. At some point, there is an
obligation to be serious.''
   ``At some point, partisan posturing must yield to the
responsibility to govern.''
   Darman also weighs in on the current controversy over Social
Security funding.
   Bush's budget proposes no change in either benefits or taxes,
but would use surpluses in the system after the year 1993 _ when
the annual budget is required to be balanced under the Gramm-Rudman
law _ to help pay off the national debt.
   By contrast, a popular proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., would roll back the Social Security tax increase that took
effect in January and reduce it further next year.
   Darman calls the Moynihan plan a ``superficially attractive
proposal.''
   But the budget director asserts that, in reality, cutting the
Social Security tax at this time would either force the government
to raise other taxes to offset the loss in revenues, or lead to a
reduction in benefits.
   ``The president's proposal ... is a responsible way to protect
the future interests of today's workers,'' Darman says.
   However, he concedes, ``Social Security is a notoriously
volatile subject when it enters the political domain. And whether
rationality will prevail remains to be determined.''
   ``This year's budget meets the responsibility to be serious,''
Darman says in his not-completely-serious introduction. ``This, of
course, is not to assert that the budget will be treated seriously
in the very next `beat-the-budget' game. It is simply to suggest
that it should be.''

   President Bush is dealing with the reconvened
Democratic Congress from a position some of his predecessors would
have used to get votesor get even. It doesn't seem to work that way
for Bush.
   Lyndon B. Johnson twisted congressional arms to gain support for
his proposals, and called it reasoning together. Ronald Reagan said
that if Congress didn't see the light, his way, he would make them
feel the heat.
   Their hardball lobbyists offered political rewards, threatened
punishments, using the popularity of their presidents and warning
that straying members might pay at the polls.
   Bush opens the 1990 campaign year with job approval ratings that
surpass the first-year standing of those predecessors and that
haven't been matched since John F. Kennedy. But so far, at least,
his personal popularity has not been convertible into lobbying
clout in Congress.
   The president did use some old-fashioned lobbying to get his way
in the first test of the year, finding three votes more than he
needed on Thursday to sustain his veto of a bill to extend the
visas of Chinese students, a step he said he already had taken with
presidential powers.
   He'd been told he would lose on the veto, even by the
head-counting Republican whips of both the House and the Senate.
They were half right; the House overrode 390 to 25. The Senate
failed to do so, 62 to 37.
   Bush and his lobbying allies used party loyalty, presidential
prerogatives and the argument that the vetoed bill was redundant in
the two-day drive that turned it around.
   Because the issue was a veto, the president needed only a
minority to keep the Senate count below the two-thirds it takes to
override. That's enough when the objective is to stop something
from happening. It takes majorities to change things or to start
new ones.
   Bush has the poll numbers, but he doesn't have the coattails
Reagan showed in his first presidential election. Reagan had
grounds to claim a mandate for major change in government, and he
had a conservative movement behind it. That gave his lieutenants a
network that could apply pressure from home districts on wavering
congressmen as the administration built its coalition of
Republicans and conservative Democrats in the House.
   Reagan also had the most saleable of issues in his first year _
the income tax cut that had been a centerpiece of his campaign.
Enacting it and pruning down the size and power of government were
his mandate.
   Bush was elected to carry on, to make it all work despite giant
budget deficits left in part because taxes were indeed cut but
government shrank little, if at all, under Reagan.
   Bush has a leftover tax cut to push, a capital gains reduction
that is likely to be passed this year. But he also is confronted
with the risk of a runaway toward the Social Security tax cut
proposed by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   His State of the Union address on Wednesday night is likely to
restate familiar proposals and priorities rather than seek new
ones, and to be coupled with a renewed call for bipartisanship.
With neither the money nor the inclination to undertake major new
programs at home, Bush is sure to emphasize successes abroad as he
keynotes the election-year congressional session.
   Seeking to head off the inevitable pressure for peace dividend
cuts in the defense budget, Bush said in advance that he will soon
present a new military plan of his own, ``to restructure America's
defenses in the wake of the dramatic changes that are taking place
abroad.''
   The defense budget he will present on Monday seeks an increase
in Pentagon spending, but Bush said it will begin ``the transition
to a restructured military, a new strategy that is more flexible,
more geared to contingencies outside of Europe while continuing to
meet our inescapable responsibility to NATO and to maintaining the
global balance.''
   Bush also will ask Congress to promote the Environmental
Protection Agency to Cabinet rank. That will be the 15th seat at
the Cabinet table.
   Overall, it is a manager's agenda, not a script for dramatic
change or a catalog of Republican issues for the campaign year.
Bush said going in that his agenda was not one of drastic change
but of building on eight years of Republican administration under
Reagan.
   The major arena of change in 1989 was outside his reach,
although it certainly worked to his benefit. The administration and
Congress could only react and respond to the largely peaceful
revolution that undid communist dominance in Eastern Europe.
   For a while, Democratic leaders criticized Bush, saying he was
too timid and too passive. But the issue didn't take.
   Republicans are trying to make Eastern Europe into a 1990 issue
on their own terms, contending their military and foreign policies
created the conditions for change.
   ``Freedom and democracy are breaking out across this entire
planet,'' Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater told party
leaders. ``I guarantee you that would not be happening today if it
were not for a decade of leadership by Ronald Reagan and George
Bush.''
   The guarantee is debatable, but there is no question that Bush
has been buoyed by those changes and by public support for his
intervention in Panama.
   For all of that, there is no sign that his current popularity
will enable the administration to move many votes, or to build a
Reagan-style coalition in Congress.
   That has more to do with the last election than with the latest
polls. In winning the White House, Bush saw his Republican ticket
lose strength in Congress. Democrats gained three seats in the
House, one in the Senate.
   A winning presidential candidate usually leads his party to
congressional gains, but Bush did not. He ran weaker than
congressional candidates in 389 of the 435 House districts.
Off-year elections historically are difficult for the president's
party. The White House party hasn't gained House seats in an off
year since 1934.

<HEAD>Bush Insists Benefits of Attending Drug Summit Outweigh Risks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House is receiving ``a lot of phone
calls'' urging President Bush not to go to a drug summit in
Colombia but he has decided that any risks to his security are
outweighed by other factors, his chief of staff says.
   ``He understands the pluses and minuses. There are a lot of hard
decisions in this ... and not every decision is all plus,'' said
John Sununu.
   Colombia has been wracked by bombings, shootings and kidnappings
ever since President Virgilio Barco declared war on the country's
cocaine drug lords last year.
   By some accounts, drug barons have put out a $30 million
assassination contract on Bush and are trying to buy surface-to-air
missiles to shoot down his plane when he travels to Cartagena for
an meeting Feb. 15 with Barco and officials of Bolivia and Peru.
   While reaffirming that Bush will attend the summit, Sununu said
the White House is taking extraordinary steps for his protection.
   ``This is critical enough that whatever we decide in terms of
logistics and timing, we will probably keep as close to the vest
until the very last minute,'' he said in an interview Friday with
five reporters.
   ``We have three or four alternatives that are reasonably
comfortable alternatives and we're trying to work with all the
South American countries involved to make sure that everybody feels
comfortable with the options we're looking at,'' he said.
   ``We'll pick _ probably at the last minute _ one option,'' he
said.
   For example, sources say the travel arrangements are being
reviewed. Rather than go into Cartagena on Air Force One, Bush
might fly somewhere else, perhaps spend some time on an aircraft
carrier and then take a helicopter to the summit.
   Sununu said all of the options involve going to Colombia. He
said Bush weighed the risks and determined ``the pluses outweigh
the minuses. We ought to be going to Cartagena.''
   Acknowledging apprehensions about Bush's trip, Sununu said, ``I
told the president we're getting a lot of phone calls, and I
communicated that to him.''
   Another security issue being examined is where to put the press
corps and White House press staff that traditionally accompany the
president.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said last week the
press operation probably would be based in another country, such as
Costa Rica, Venezuela or Panama.
   However, a number of reporters and news organizations have
objected to that idea, and Fitzwater now says the decision could go
either way.
   Commenting on that topic, Sununu said, ``Frankly, the hard part
that we have to deal with ... is that we really don't have a
structure for full protection of people beyond the president.
   ``That's a real concern, that we don't have a security structure
that extends that far out in the circle of the onion layer,'' he
said. ``And so, we are looking for combinations that allow us to
use the inherent security we have for the president and, if you
will, the logistics and the geography to the best benefit of
everybody else that is there.''

   A baby girl stolen when she was 36 hours old
snuggled in her mother's arms again Saturday after police found the
child safe and well in a rented cottage.
   ``She looks exactly the same as she was before,'' Dawn Griffiths
said Saturday as she held her baby, Alexandra, at St. Thomas'
Hospital, where the child was stolen Jan. 11.
   Acting on a tip, police found the baby Friday night in Burford,
65 miles northwest of London. The infant was in the care of a
35-year-old woman at a cottage known as the Old Police House, the
village's former police station.
   Scotland Yard said the woman had been arrested, but a spokesman
said her name would not be released unless she was charged.
   Police said the baby was taken by a woman who claimed to be a
health service aide and told Miss Griffiths she needed to give the
baby a routine blood test.
   The abduction and the anguish of Miss Griffiths, 20, and the
baby's father, Geoffrey Harris, 25, was front-page news during
their 15-day ordeal. Their appeals for the return of their daughter
were broadcast on television and radio.
   Detective Chief Superintendent John Bassett, the police officer
in charge of the hunt, said detectives recovered the baby after a
tip by neighbors.
   Bassett said the arrested woman answered the door when the
detectives arrived. They found the baby asleep in an upstairs room,
he said.

<HEAD>Statehood Advocates Hope to Prevail Despite Barry Arrest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates of statehood for the nation's
capital plan to make sure their message will not be lost in the
turmoil caused by Mayor Marion Barry's cocaine possession arrest.
   Any tourists wishing to visit the Vista Hotel, where Barry
allegedly smoked crack cocaine, first will have to pass signs
advising them that they are entering the ``nation's last colony.''
   Barry's arrest Jan. 18 on a federal charge of possessing cocaine
has focused attention on his crumbling political fortunes and a
possible mayoral candidacy by Jesse Jackson. But it has also
stirred a quieter debate over the impact on a long-moribund drive
to make the city the 51st state.
   ``Clearly this sets that back,'' Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., a city
critic, said last week after Barry's arrest. ``There is not an
organized crescendo'' (against home rule), he said. ``There is an
increased discussion about whether this thing is really working.''
   Jackson has taken up the statehood cause, regardless of whether
it leads to a personal candidacy.
   ``Maryland was not disenfranchised when (Gov. Marvin) Mandel
went to jail,'' the two-time Democratic presidential hopeful said
last week. ``There is no valid argument for denying statehood to
the nearly 700,000 people who live here.''
   Residents of the District of Columbia have no voting
representatives in Congress, even though the city claims a larger
population than either Delaware, North Dakota, Vermont or Wyoming.
The city's budget must be approved by Congress, and the House and
Senate have permanent committees to oversee the district's affairs.
   Congress approved home rule in 1974 _ Barry is only the city's
second mayor to be elected _ but took back some of the powers 15
years later.
   Both houses passed a proposed constitutional amendment for
statehood in 1978, but it expired seven years later when only 16 of
the required 38 states ratified it.
   New legislation is expected to be introduced in Congress again
in the near future.
   But before the district's chances for statehood are improved,
touchy issues having nothing to do with the mayor need to be
resolved. One is the question of whether the city should still get
an annual payment from the federal government. Another is the
difficulty of winning Republican support for statehood when the
district, with its overwhelmingly black population, almost
certainly would wind up with two Democratic senators.
   The view from the pro-statehood forces, not surprisingly, is
that Barry's arrest will not do lasting harm.
   ``We will persevere,'' said Josephine Butler, chairwoman of the
district's statehood commission.
   ``His arrest is important, but it is a short-term thing, while
statehood is enduring. Statehood has been a long and tedious
process, and we will overcome this and our other problems.''
   The board is advertising the city's unique status with road
signs that say, ``Welcome to the Nation's Last Colony. All
residents must leave their rights at the border. D.C. Statehood
Now.''
   Walter Fauntroy, the city's non-voting delegate in the House,
sees a possible silver lining in Barry's difficulties. Envisioning
a city with a new mayor, Fauntroy said, ``Members of Congress who
would use a man who admittedly has a problem ... no longer have
that excuse.''
   Whatever the impact on the city, there is no doubting the effect
on Barry's fortunes.
   Longtime Barry fund-raiser Robert Johnson, president of Black
Entertainment Television, said he would not back any re-election
effort by the mayor. Several influential ministers said likewise,
as did a prominent business group that has supported the city's
leader in the past.
   Barry, who entered a private treatment facility in West Palm
Beach, Fla., for what an aide said was treatment of alcoholism, has
not said publicly what his political plans are, but sources have
said he has said he would not seek a new term.
   With each new sign that Barry's political career may be doomed,
more attention is paid to Jackson, whose move to the nation's
capital last year fueled rumors that he might make a bid for the
mayor's chair.
   Through the week, the mystery surrounding Jackson remained the
same: he said time and again that he is not interested in running
for mayor; he also repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility
that he might get into the race if Barry bows out.
   ``A public servant ... never says never,'' Jackson said.
   Meanwhile, a group of prominent local labor leaders and
businessmen held a pair of meetings to devise a draft-Jackson
strategy; a separate group of attorneys did the same thing.

<HEAD>`Robin HUD' Says She'll Plead Guilty To in HUD Thefts Plea Bargain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A real estate agent dubbed ``Robin HUD'' after
admitting she stole millions of dollars in federal housing funds
and gave some money to the poor says she has decided to accept a
bargain with prosecutors and plead guilty to two counts.
   ``I don't want to spend taxpayers' money in a court
proceeding,'' Marilyn Louise Harrell told The Sun in Baltimore on
Friday.
   Harrell, 46, of Waldorf has admitted taking millions in U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development money, and said she has
prepared herself for imprisonment since 1985, when she first
started diverting HUD funds.
   Scheduled to appear Monday in U.S. District Court, Harrell said
she hopes to be sentenced to perform community service, but regards
prison as a chance to get a college degree.
   ``I told the kids (her son, John, and his wife, Vicki), just
think of it as Mom going away a few years for college,'' said
Harrell, who will become a grandmother sometime next month.
   In a deal with the U.S. attorney's office, Harrell said she will
plead guilty to stealing government property and failing to report
income for taxes.
   In return, prosecutors will drop two other tax counts, two
counts of lying to HUD and one count of lying to a bank on a loan
application, Harrell said.
   She was to go to trial on those charges Monday. If convicted on
all counts, she would have faced a maximum of 31 years in prison
and more than $1 million in fines.
   The two charges she says she will admit to Monday carry a
maximum sentence of 13 years in prison. But under federal
sentencing guidelines, she could serve 2{ to 3 years in prison,
Harrell said.
   Harrell's attorney, Anthony R. Gallagher, declined to comment
Friday, as did Gary P. Jordan, first assistant U.S. attorney, the
newspaper said. Attempts by The Associated Press to reach them by
telephone Saturday were unsuccessful; there was no answer at their
offices and their home numbers are unlisted. There was no answer at
Harrell's home Saturday.
   Harrell, who confessed her crimes to government officials in
December 1988, became a symbol of mismanagement at HUD when scandal
erupted there last summer. Following her indictment last November,
U.S. Attorney General Richard L. Thornburgh said the case was the
single largest involving the theft of federal funds by an
individual.
   Harrell went against the advice of her attorney and freely
discussed taking the money in testimony before Congress and in
several nationally televised interviews.
   ``I never did have a problem with pleading guilty on No. 1, the
embezzlement charge,'' Harrell said. ``Obviously, that's something
that's known nationwide.''
   Prosecutors say Harrell took at least $5.67 million from sales
of HUD properties she handled as a private escrow agent.
Prosecutors acknowledge that some money went to charities, but say
much of it went to Harrell and her family.
   Harrell said she has documents to prove that she took only $4.75
million in HUD funds and that ``less than 6 percent'' of the money
benefited her family.
   Many charities and individuals acknowledge having received
thousands of dollars in gifts and donations from Harrell, but she
has said she does not want those people to testify on her behalf.
   ``I really truthfully consider it an honor to give up years of
my life to help some of the people I've helped,'' she said.

<DATELINE>KANTA YOLE, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Keson Kaleu was able to save
three of her own children and four of a stranger's. But when she
arrived in this Ivorian village, she broke down and cried for the
son she said was shot by Liberian soldiers.
   ``They killed my child,'' the young woman wailed as she limped
into Kanta Yole, ending a two-day trek through dense forest and
across the Cavally River.
   Here, 300 Ivorian villagers are sharing their homes and meager
food supplies with more than 900 people who say they survived a
massacre by Liberian government troops.
   Bloodshed began Dec. 24 when rebels supporting former civil
servant Charles Taylor tried to overthrow the government of
President Samuel Doe.
   Government troops were sent in to put down rebel attacks in
eastern Liberia, and a Western diplomat and an Ivorian official
said Thursday the soldiers had killed about 500 civilians.
   Liberian officials say troops shot some civilians, but only
armed civilians who attacked them.
   The Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
rebels retaliated by moving south and slaughtering citizens from
Doe's Krahn tribe, one of several ethnic groups in Liberia.
   Ivorian officials and international aid agency workers visiting
Kanta Yole when Mrs. Kaleu arrived during the weekend asked her to
describe the killing of her son. But she was too distraught even to
repeat his name.
   ``They just shot him down as we ran to hide,'' she kept saying
as she nursed a crying baby.
   Later, she told a reporter: ``It was Samuel Doe's soldiers who
killed my baby.''
   Mrs. Kaleu has three daughters, but male children are valued
above females in Africa.
   In her misery, she failed to see the happy reunion of Moses Duo
and his four children. Mrs. Kaleu hid the children in the thick
bush every time she heard the gunfire that still echoes from across
the Liberian border.
   English teacher John M. Layweah, 44, who fled the Liberian town
of Kahnplay on Jan. 3, said the sounds of battle reached Kanta Yole
on Tuesday.
   ``New refugees say the rebels pushed the government forces out
of the town,'' he said.
   Layweah said nearly 192 residents of the town of 3,000,
including Mrs. Kaleu, have found their way to Kanta Yole. Kahnplay
is 60 miles from the border and Kanta Yole is five miles beyond.
   Refugees have crowded into the small thatched huts of the
villagers. Many have relatives here.
   ``Forty and 50 people are sleeping head-to-toe in huts designed
for 10,'' said the Rev. Gnalla Henri, a Roman Catholic priest who
came from the nearby town of Danane with 25 blankets.
   Reunited with his three daughters and son, Duo took them to a
half-finished hut of sticks and palm fronds he began building when
he arrived Wednesday.
   He said he lost his children in the chaos of trying to dodge
bullets.
   ``First, we hid under the beds. When the firing stopped for
awhile, my daughter started crying that a child was dead. I crawled
to the hallway and saw the body of a neighbor's child. That's when
we ran for the bushes, even though there was still gunfire and, the
next thing, I did not know where my children were.''
   Fears that haunt the refugees surfaced at Kanta Yole when
villagers accused two new arrivals of being collaborators who led
government troops to hiding places of some victims and helped
soldiers set homes ablaze.
   They gathered in muttering groups around a hut where the accused
men were dragged before a village headman. He struck one of them
with a belt when the man tried to declare his innocence. The
headman said he would hand over the two men to the Ivorian military.
   Layweah described the beginning of the conflict, which has
forced more than 72,000 Liberians to flee to Ivory Coast and Guinea.
   ``In Kahnplay, we were celebrating New Year's Day when we heard
gunfire. We ran into our homes. Then the rebels moved in and
demanded that we cook them food.
   ``Later that night, the soldiers came. We fled into the bush to
escape and watched them just rattle off their guns into people's
homes. God knows how many innocent people died.''
   Layweah said he did not know the aims of the rebels but said,
``It is obvious that Doe's soldiers are out to kill off the Gio and
Mano people. How else can you explain such barbaric and unprovoked
attacks?''
   Liberia has more than 15 ethnic groups. The Guere, Gio and Mano
tribes, who live along the eastern and northern border, long have
complained of oppression by Doe's Krahn people, who comprise about
5 percent of the population but dominate positions of power.
   Doe seized power in 1980 from the descendants of freed American
slaves who founded Liberia in 1847.

<HEAD>Sudanese Rebels Announce Daylong Cease-Fire to Evacuate Foreigners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudanese rebels said they will stop shelling
the provincial capital of war-torn southern Sudan on Monday to
allow foreigners to leave and emergency supplies to be brought in.
   In a broadcast monitored in London on Saturday, the Sudan
People's Liberation Army, or SPLA, said the cease-fire was agreed
upon during a meeting with an unidentified U.S. diplomat
representing the United States, Britain and international relief
agencies.
   It said the meeting took place Friday in the Ethiopian capital.
   The broadcast said rebels agreed to stop shelling Juba for 12
hours Monday to allow evacuation of foreigners. The only foreigners
known to be in Juba are relief workers.
   There was no immediate comment from Sudanese government
officials.
   The government suspended international relief flights to
war-affected areas in southern Sudan on Nov. 3, raising fears that
hundreds of thousands of malnourished Sudanese would die of famine.
In 1988, the United Nations estimated that 250,000 people died of
starvation in the war-torn area; others put the figure at twice
that.
   On Wednesday, the government said it would allow relief
organizations to airlift 5,000 tons of food donated by the European
Economic Community from Nairobi, Kenya, to Juba.
   The government also said it had given permission to the
International Committee of the Red Coss to airlift relief supplies
to Juba and rebel-held areas. The Red Cross said it hopes to begin
relief flights Monday.
   ``Within that period, the SPLA would not shell Juba, nor would
it shoot at the planes evacuating these foreigners,'' the broadcast
said.
   ``Should any military plane fly into Juba at times not within
the specified hours, these agreements will be rendered null and
void,'' the broadcast warned.
   Juba has been under periodic artillery bombardment from the
rebels.
   The broadcast said the rebels on Tuesday captured the garrison
town of Umm Dawrayn and assumed full control of the entire Umm
Dawrayn district.
   Fighting between rebels and government forces has intensifed in
southern Sudan since late October when an informal truce broke down.
   In addition to Umm Dawrayn, the rebels claim to have captured 11
government-controlled towns near the Zaire and Uganda borders this
year.
   The mainly Christian and animist rebels began their struggle in
early 1983, demanding greater autonomy from the Moslem-dominated
government and economic reforms in the three southern provinces of
Bahr el-Ghazal, Upper Nile and Equatoria.

   Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi
arrived here Saturday to discuss the civil war in his country and
to ask Portuguese officials to help mediate the conflict in their
former colony.
   The war between the U.S.-supported guerrillas and Marxist
government forces began when Angola became independent from
Portugual 16 years ago.
   Portugal had refused Savimbi an entry visa until peace talks
began in earnest in June with the signing of a short-lived
cease-fire agreement.
   The nine-day visit takes Savimbi away from the battlefront,
where 12,000 of his guerrillas are holding off what rebel officers
describe as the biggest government offensive ever mounted against
the rebel movement.
   A few hours before Savimbi landed in Lisbon, Angolan Deputy
Defense Minister Colonel Antonio Paulo Kassoma arrived for an
official visit that will include talks on military cooperation
between the two countries.
   Hundreds of supporters, many from the 150,000-strong Angolan
community, shouted ``Viva Savimbi'' and waved rebel flags as the
guerrilla leader arrived at Lisbon Airport aboard a private jet.
   ``I hope my contacts in Portugal will help open a new chapter in
which our two peoples can move forward together,'' toward peace in
Angola, Savimbi said in brief remarks at the airport. He then drove
in an armor-plated limousine through streets lined with posters
calling for peace and democracy in Angola.
   In a later speech to a group of prominent political figures, he
said: ``Portugal could serve as a link between the rebels and the
government ... serving as a moderator helping to bring about a
sincere and honest dialogue.'' Savimbi said President Mario Soares
would receive him in an unofficial capacity. Prime Minister Anibal
Cavaco Silva and other government leaders have declined to confirm
reports they will also meet Savimbi in a private capacity.
   Alcides Sakala, a spokesman for the guerrillas _ known as the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA _
said of Savimbi: ``No important political figure will fail to meet
him.''
   Savimbi has said that Portugal, the colonial ruler of Angola for
four centuries, could play a more important role in peace talks.
   ``Portugal needs to be better informed about what is happening
in Angola so that it can better fulfill the role of a mediator,''
Savimbi told a Portuguese newspaper before his visit. ``Without the
Portuguese, the reconstruction of Angola will never be possible.''
   Zaire's President Mobuto Sese Seko is the official mediator of
peace efforts in Angola. But UNITA and the Angolan government have
both said Portugal has a part to play in furthering the peace
process.
   Savimbi said discussions on Angola between Cavaco Silva and
President Bush in Washington earlier this month show that Portugal
has a role to play.
   Western diplomats in Lisbon said Cavaco Silva had urged the
United States to take a more even-handed approach to the Angolan
conflict, giving greater recognition to the Angolan government.
   Washington has repeatedly refused to recognize the Angolan
government and reportedly supplies Savimbi with $50 million a year
in military aid.

   A welding supply company was struck two
nights in a row by a cat burglar _ a four-legged one.
   James Rich Jr., president of J.A. Welding Supply Co., said
police responded early Thursday when the company's burglar alarm
went off, but officers found nothing.
   Then when employees came in, they found a huge 20-pound cat
huddled in the bathroom. Rich put the animal back outside, and
employees taking a look around the plant determined that the cat
had fallen through some ceiling tiles to get inside the building.
   On Friday morning, employees opened the store and were surprised
to find insulation all over the floor. The cat apparently did not
set off the burglar alarm this time, however.
   Rich said the robust kitty didn't look like it wanted a bowl of
warm milk or some Tender Vittles. He said it more closely resembled
the junkyard variety that feeds on mice and rats.
   Lots of mice and rats.
   ``That has got to be the biggest cat I've ever seen,'' said Rich.
   The animal refused to be coaxed into the box. Finally, two
employees nabbed it and put it in the box.
   Rich said the animal would be turned over to authorities to make
sure it doesn't have rabies.

   Rafael Leonardo Callejas was sworn
in Saturday as president and pledged to work for peace in Central
America, where he said people ``live with machine-gun fire and
terror.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle and four Latin American presidents
were among dignitaries from 60 nations at the inauguration, which
marked Honduras' first peaceful transfer of power to an opposition
party in 57 years.
   Callejas urged Central Americans to unite ``to fight for dignity
and progress in our republics, because nobody in the world has the
right to choose our destiny searching for greater progress and
winning dignity and honor.''
   He also outlined goals of raising the life expectancy and
literacy rates, creating more jobs, reducing the nation's debt,
selling off state-owned companies and improving public health in
one of the poorest nations in the Western Hemisphere.
   ``We are confronting our worst economic problems Honduras has
faced in its history as a republic. However, it will not discourage
us because we are convinced that by adopting adequate measures in
an opportune manner and rousing up national willingness, we will
move ahead,'' Callejas said.
   Callejas, 46, comes from a landholding family and was trained as
an agricultural economist at Mississippi State University. He was
not expected to change Honduras' strong ties to the United States.
   The National Party candidate won the election Nov. 26 by beating
Carlos Flores of the governing Liberal Party. He replaces Jose
Azcona Hoyo.
   The new president of the legislature, Rodolfo Irias Navas,
placed the presidential sash on Callejas, whose term runs through
January 1994. Among the 40,000 people attending the ceremony at the
national soccer stadium were presidents Vincio Cerezo of Guatemala,
Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador,
and Oscar Arias of Costa Rica.
   Callejas said peace will come to the region only through
cooperation with other governments.
   ``Lasting peace in Central America will come only when it is
built through the reduction of armies and the elimination of
offensive arms,'' he declared.
   ``We must systematically apply democracy so nobody in Central
America is threatened by tanks and solders and so nobody believes
that the opportunities for personal development are available only
for the few,'' he said.
   ``Our Central American sister countries still live with
machine-gun fire and terror,'' he said.
   Relations between Honduras and Nicaragua have been tense for
years because Honduras has allowed anti-Sandinista Contra rebels to
set up bases on its territory.
   Callejas has said he wants the U.S.-backed rebels removed but
wants to keep close military relations with the United States,
which maintains an air base in Honduras. He made no specific
mention about the Contras or U.S. base in his inaugural address.
   
   The new president has promised to decentralize the government,
sell some state-owned companies and create incentives for
investment and exports.
   Honduras has a per capita income of about $500.
   Honduras' principal exports are bananas, coffee, beef, lumber,
metals and sugar. Its major trading partner is the United States.
   Honduras returned to elected government in 1980 after nearly 20
years of military rule.
   The last time there was a party-to-party transition came in
1933, when Tiburcio Carias Andino of the National Party took over
from Liberal Vicente Mejia Colindres. Carias didn't allow another
vote until 1948.

   A harvest crew chief may face traffic
charges in the deaths of 10 Mexican migrant workers who drowned
when their van plunged into a fog-shrouded canal, but broke no
state labor law, investigators say.
   Rutilio Escobedo, 28, the driver, did not break state law
regulating the transportation of farm laborers by driving 11
co-workers to a citrus grove near this Lake Okeechobee farm
community, a preliminary state report says.
   Escobedo, whose wife died in Wednesday's crash, was discharged
Friday from Hendry General Hospital after treatment for injuries
received when his van ran off a curve south of Clewiston and
plunged into the canal.
   He may face charges of driving on a suspended license, but no
charges will be filed for two or three weeks, a police spokesman
said.
   The U.S. Labor and Transportation departments and the National
Transportation Safety Board also are investigating of the crash.
   Escobedo blamed the crash on a frozen steering mechanism, but
investigators said there was no evidence of a mechanical problem.
   W.T. Coppage Harvesting Inc. of La Belle, a farm labor
contractor that hired Escobedo as a crew chief, also was cleared of
any state labor-law violations, said Gil Hill, chief of the Bureau
of Agriculture Programs in Tallahassee.
   FHP officers have released the names of five victims in the
crash. Names of the other five victims were withheld while police
tried to contact relatives in Mexico.
   Escobedo's uncle, Nicolas Escobedo, 50, was the only other
survivor of the accident.

<TEXT>
   Fired Exxon skipper Joseph Hazelwood
would rather be at sea than in a courtroom this week, but is
looking forward to making the case that he should not bear criminal
blame for the nation's worst oil spill.
   ``I'd like to get rid of the misconception that I got drunk, ran
the ship aground, and just shrugged my shoulders and walked away _
because that's just not what happened,'' Hazelwood said in an
interview with The Associated Press last week in his New York
lawyer's office.
   The 43-year-old former captain of the tanker Exxon Valdez is
scheduled to go on trial Monday in Anchorage Superior Court.
   Judge Karl Johnstone expects to spend at least the first day
briefing news media representatives about courtroom rules and
considering motions before jury selection begins in what could be
at least a six-week trial.
   Hazelwood's attorneys recently submitted motions after losing
several efforts to have charges dismissed in various courts,
including Johnstone's. There are new analytical twists to the
latest motions, but essentially they are the same as earlier
requests.
   One challenges the state's jurisdiction in the case and another
seeks to prohibit as evidence the results of a blood-alcohol test
that Hazelwood failed about 10 hours after the Exxon Valdez ran
aground.
   The hull of the tanker ripped open March 24 on a charted reef in
Prince William Sound and gushed nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska
crude into the pristine waters. The oil blackened shores in the
sound and the Gulf of Alaska, killed thousands of animals and
disrupted commercial fishing seasons. Exxon says the cleanup has
cost $2 billion.
   Hazelwood, who was not on the bridge when the crash happened,
faces a felony charge of criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges
of operating a vessel while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and
negligent discharge of oil.
   The charges carry combined, maximum penalties of seven years,
three months in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Defense attorney Dick Madson is expected to argue that Hazelwood
left sound instructions for members of the crew and cannot be held
criminally responsible for their actions. Third Mate Gregory
Cousins was at the wheel of the 987-foot tanker when it ran into
Bligh Reef after leaving designated shipping lanes.
   Anchorage Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole would not
discuss the prosecution's plans. In the past, prosecutors have said
that Hazelwood should have been at the helm since he was the ship's
only authorized navigator for Prince William Sound. His lawyers say
the Coast Guard relaxed the rules in 1986.
   In an affidavit accompanying a subpoena served Friday on Cousins
in Tampa, Fla., Cole said Hazelwood put the tanker on a southward
course to avoid ice and set the automatic pilot before he left the
ship in Cousins' hands.
   Cousins said he would not talk to reporters before testifying at
Hazelwood's trial. ``I'll be saying it all in Anchorage _ probably
over and over,'' Cousins said.
   Madson said witnesses will include a computer expert who will
discuss a computer simulation for the ship's course. The witness
will testify the ship would have cleared Bligh Reef had Hazelwood's
instructions been followed, Madson said.
   He also plans to call crew members and experts on naval
architecture and the physical effects of alcohol.
   Hazelwood is expected to be in the courtroom for the whole
trial. The seaman has been living with his wife and teen-age
daughter in Huntington, N.Y., on Long Island, and working as a
lobsterman in the months since Exxon fired him.
   Before his tanker ran aground, the longest he had been ashore
since he was an adolescent was two or three months.
   ``I get stark crazy when I am too far from the salt water,'' he
said, chain-smoking at the interview in Manhattan.
   Hazelwood said he is confident that once Alaskans hear the case
against him ``they will agree that this was a tragic accident,
nothing more.''
   His trial, originally scheduled for October in Valdez, the port
town from which the tanker sailed a few hours before the accident,
was delayed as the court system reassigned judges and processed
thick stacks of motions.
   The trial was moved to Anchorage on grounds a fair proceeding
could not be obtained in Valdez, and because Alaska's largest city
has a substantial jury pool and facilities needed for extensive
media coverage.
   Court officials said it could take at least a week to screen
about 75 prospective jurors for 12 jury positions plus those of
alternates.

   Nelson Mandela does not want
to be freed from jail until the government ends its state of
emergency and legalizes the African National Congress, the wife of
the anti-apartheid leader said Saturday.
   Winnie Mandela also said her husband wants the government to
allow exiled African National Congress officials to return home as
a condition to his freedom.
   Previously, Mandela's colleagues have said the ANC leader was
eager to go free as soon as the government approved his
unconditional release.
   However, Mrs. Mandela, returning to Johannesburg after a
four-hour visit to Victor Verster Prison Farm near Cape Town, said
her husband would refuse freedom until the government ended the
state of emergency, lifted the ban on the ANC, and allowed exiled
ANC officials to return.
   ``I think the government has serious problems meeting the
demands the government has to meet before his release,'' she said.
``There is no question of him walking out of Victor Verster without
those demands having been met.''
   The demands she mentioned have also been listed by the ANC as
conditions the government must meet before the guerrilla movement
agrees to negotiations. Mandela's release was widely expected to
precede any lifting of the ban on the ANC.
   ``It is quite clear there are a lot of hurdles along the way,''
Mrs. Mandela told journalists when she emerged from the prison.
``It is quite clear problems have cropped up about his immediate
release.''
   Mrs. Mandela appeared pensive and uneasy after visiting her
husband.
   Three weeks ago, she emerged from a visit brimming with optimism
that his freedom was imminent. She said Mandela was in lower
spirits on this visit.
   Mandela, 71, has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life
sentence for helping plan the start of the ANC's anti-government
sabotage campaign. He is the country's best-known black leader, and
the government has expressed interest in his offer to mediate in
negotiations with the ANC.
   President F.W. de Klerk has said he would like to remove
obstacles to negotiations and is expected to speak about the ANC's
conditions in an address to Parliament on Feb. 2.
   In other developments Saturday, officials of the state-run South
African Transport Services and the South African Railway and Harbor
Workers Union signed an agreement ending one of the country's most
violent strikes.
   The union failed to win even part of its requested 150 percent
pay increase, but the company agreed to recognize the union and
rehire all of the 23,000 strikers who were fired.
   The workers had demanded that their minimum monthly wage be
increased from $240 to $600.
   Numerous battles occurred between strikers and non-strikers.
   Railway coaches and tracks were sabotaged, with a loss to the
company estimated at $16 million. The company employs about 170,000
people and runs rail and harbor operations nationwide.
   In Boksburg, an industrial city near Johannesburg, 100
mixed-race residents arrived at a whites-only lakeside park for a
picnic and were confronted by a group of conservative whites,
including khaki-clad members of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance
Movement.
   The park was declared whites-only in late 1988 after the
far-right Conservative Party took control of the city council in
municipal elections.
   No serious injuries were reported in the clash.
   However, two white men were arrested after they tore down a
protest banner that said: ``Mandela: The freedom of Boksburg awaits
you.''
   In the town of Kimberley, several hundred protesters staged a
relatively peaceful demonstration outside a stadium where an
English team was playing a squad of second-division local players.
   The team is defying a ban on sports contacts with South Africa.

   Blacks protesting the presence of
an English cricket team that broke a boycott clashed with police
Saturday in a township outside this mining city.
   Police said protesters burned down the home of a black constable
and threw stones at vehicles. There were unconfirmed reports that
some protesters were injured by shotgun pellets.
   Earlier in the day, several hundred protesters staged a
relatively peaceful demonstration outside the stadium where the
English team, in South Africa for a six-week tour, was playing a
squad of second-division local players.
   At one point, someone inside the stadium threw a bottle over the
fence at protesters, and stones were hurled back. There was no
serious trouble until police confronted some protesters on their
way back home and fired rubber bullets at them.
   On Friday, the start of the three-day Kimberley match, witnesses
said black youths ran through the city center breaking car and shop
windows after police refused to allow a protest. Police said 31
youths were arrested and reported that a 52-year-old man was
injured by the protesters.
   Protest leaders met with Ali Bacher, managing director of the
South African Cricket Union, and demanded they be allowed to march
on the stadium.
   Bacher, who has been seeking to minimize conflict related to the
tour, later went to a local magistrate and obtained his approval
for a protest to be held outside the stadium Saturday.
   The English team is defying a ban on sports contacts with South
Africa that was imposed to protest its policies of racial
segregation.
   The English players face expulsion from international cricket
for five years for taking part in the tour.
   Activists have vowed to stage protests throughout the visit by
the English team, led by former national captain Mike Gatting.
There have been protests outside the hotels where the players have
been staying in Johannesburg and Kimberley.
   The English players have not said how much they are being paid
for the tour, but local newspapers have put the figure at $160,000.

   A slain Israeli businessman told friends he
traveled with Secret Service agents four times in preparation for
President Bush's trip to Colombia, but an agency spokesman said he
knew of no such connection, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   Arik Afek, 39, apparently traveled on a U.S. diplomatic passport
issued under a sealed federal court agreement signed in Miami, The
Miami Herald said, quoting unidentified sources.
   Afek told friends that the agreement included the government's
promise to help him avoid prosecution for his part in helping
mercenaries who allegedly trained paramilitary groups for Colombian
drug cartels, the newspaper said.
   His body was found Wednesday in the trunk of his parked car at
Miami International Airport in what police describe as a gangland
execution-style shooting. No arrest has been made.
   Afek's shadowy past also reportedly made him a target of the
Drug Enforcement Administration and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, but federal agencies neither confirm nor
deny any interest in the murder case.
   ``It's just another homicide in Miami to us,'' said Secret
Service spokesman Allan Cramer in Washington.
   Secret Service agents preparing for Bush's planned anti-drug
summit next month in Colombia interviewed Afek after NBC reported
his links to paramilitary groups also involving Israeli army
reserve Lt. Col. Yair Klein.
   Both were named on arrest warrants issued by a Colombian judge
in September, charged with enlisting civilians in military
operations without government approval.
   The pair reportedly acknowledged a role in paramilitary training
but said it was limited to training farmers against guerrilla
attack and had no connection to drug traffickers.
   Asked about Afek's role last September, Eyal Dror, business
manager for Klein's security company, said, ``I know Afek and he
can't be taken seriously.''
   Dr. Nardo Zaias, a Miami dermatologist and a former partner in
Afek's imported flower business, told The New York Times: ``He was
not a very clever guy. He was a big kid, somewhat emotional and
naive.''

<TEXT>
   The street names are the same, the
faces familiar. Gossip still makes the circuit, drugs sometimes
change hands, and families still struggle to get by.
   This is no longer the El Chorrillo neighborhood, however, but
its essence, distilled down by an invasion and filtered into an
airplane hangar at Albrook Field, a joint-use air base used by U.S.
and Panamanian forces.
   ``We paid the highest price for the invasion,'' says Francisco
Martinez ``We had little, but we lost it all.''
   Martinez is among the estimated 16,000 refugees from El
Chorrillo, the neighborhood with the bad luck to be the home of the
Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters, the U.S. Army's main target
during the invasion of Panama on Dec. 20.
   President Bush on Thursday proposed giving $1 billion in
economic aid to Panama, and local officials said they are
discussing plans to provide new homes for the refugees.
   But despite those good intentions, the refugees most likely will
be living in tents or in small cubbyholes in a big hangar for at
least a year.
   ``It is unjust. Things ought to move a lot faster. These people
need a home,'' said Sergio Galvez, director of the camp sheltering
3,500 refugees on the northwestern edge of Panama City.
   A U.S. civilian affairs group is working with Panamanian
officials, trying to determine how to house the homeless while
rebuilding goes on.
   ``We can only make recommendations,'' said Vince Ryan, a Houston
city councilman who is a member of the group. ``The Panamanian
government must make a decision. They are talking about different
things that could be done ranging from building apartment
buildings, giving each family credit to build a home or turning
this area into a commercial area.''
   ``But anyone who tells you they can rebuild in nine months is an
optimist,'' said Ryan.
   Families live in partitions made of wooden frames and canvas.
Some of the alleys have been given names of streets from the old
neighborhood, less than two miles away.
   ``No gossips allowed,'' reads a piece of canvas that serves as a
door on one of the partitions.
   ``Gossip and disinformation are some of the problems,'' said
Galvez. ``People get desperate, there are nearly 6,000 unemployed
among those who lost their homes. Some people go around telling
others that the U.S. Army is giving cash to every family, and
within minutes you have a mob asking for the money.''
   ``Everybody is looking out for himself,'' said Miguel Martinez,
23. ``We were not a very united community back in El Chorrillo.''
   Martinez was working as a helper in a home for the elderly next
to El Chorrillo's church when the U.S. effort to oust Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega began at 12:30 a.m. U.S. officials say most of the
damage wasn't caused by the attack itself, but by fires set by
Noriega supporters.
   ``We got everyone out safely the next morning,'' Martinez said.
``The church did not burn down.''
   ``I guess I could go back, but I'm trying to help here. Some of
us get together and do volunteer work distributing medicines, food,
cleaning up and doing other jobs. We are here sharing the suffering
of our brothers,'' he said.
   Polio left Manelis Sanchez, 19, without the use of his legs. He
was a popular figure in El Chorrillo, moving around on his crutches
doing odd jobs or going to a busy corner downtown where he stopped
cars and asked drivers for money for ``an operation.''
   He lived in a shack next to the church.
   ``I was in bed when they started shooting,'' he said. ``My
friend told me, `This is Bush's Christmas gift for Noriega.'''
   There are problems at the camp. A security officer said there
was some low-level drug selling and consumption.
   ``Remember a lot of the people in El Chorillo lived off the sale
and distribution of drugs and contraband,'' said the officer, who
refused to give his name.
   This week, the U.S. Army stopped distributing ration packages to
the refugees. From now on food will have to come from private
donations.
   U.S. soldiers still provide security, but camp administration is
being taken over by the Panamanian Red Cross, with help from the
U.S. Agency for International Development; Caritas, a Roman
Catholic charity; and other charities.
   ``It was a tough neighborhood. They are boisterous, complain
about things, want their own kind of food, and are always arguing.
You have to understand them,'' Galvez said. ``You must understand

camp while others are discussing how long you are going to stay

   El Chorrillo has been leveled and cleared by U.S. Army
engineers. Most of the wooden three-story structures dating back to
the beginning of the century are gone. Still standing are three
concrete apartment buildings in need of extensive repairs.
   Estimates of the cost of rebuilding El Chorrillo alone range
from $30 million to $50 million; the White House said Thursday that
it was earmarking $42 million in aid for housing, emergency public
works, small business rehabilitation for looting victims and
technical assistance to the government.
   It is not certain Congress will approve everything Bush wants,
even though President Guillermo Endara said even $1 billion is only
half what Panama needs.

   President Bush's $1.23 trillion federal budget
for fiscal 1991 will contain a warning to Congress from budget
director Richard G. Darman against seeking a ``wonderland'' in
which military savings can be diverted to domestic programs,
administration officials said today.
   ``The near-term `peace dividend' is likely to be smaller than
commonly assumed,'' Darman tells Congress in an introduction to the
budget document, the officials said.
   Bush's budget plan will propose a reduction of the federal
deficit to $63.1 billion, roughly half as much as the current
expected deficit, through a series of austere military and domestic
programs, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   Bush will propose total spending of $1.233 trillion and will
project revenues to the government at $1.17 trillion.
   The budget includes an austere $292.1 billion for the Pentagon,
which works out to a slight increase over current spending but a
reduction of about 2 percent after inflation is taken into account,
the sources said.
   Some members of Congress have proposed that the reductions in
military tensions in Eastern Europe can be turned into a so-called
``peace dividend'' and spent on expanding social programs.
   Darman, however, will tell Congress it would be ``naively
euphoric'' to expect that the crumbling of the Soviet Empire will
spell a final end to East-West tensions.
   In his preface to the budget, to be formally submitted on
Monday, Darman will compare the federal budget to the ``ultimate
Cookie Monster,'' a reference to the character in the popular
children's television show ``Sesame Street,'' the officials said,
speaking on the condition of anonymity.
   ``It's excess tendencies toward consumption are not exactly
ennobling...But at the same time, its underlying motivation is
clearly not malevolent. What harm it might cause is largely
unintended.''
   Excerpts from Darman's introduction, first published in today's
editions of the New York Times, were confirmed by administration
officials.
   Darman also will tell Congress that many programs in the budget
are like ``Pacman'' in the popular video game, ``waiting to spring
forward and consume another line of resources dots in the budget
maze.''
   Details of the budget were surfacing on Friday in advance of the
formal submission to Congress.
   Bush himself tipped his hand on one major program increase,
announcing the proposal for the increase in spending on the Head
Start program for low-income children. He said every youngster
``deserves the opportunity for a full and happy life.''
   Bush said the new funds would permit Head Start's enrollment to
grow to 667,000 children, or 70 percent of the nation's
disadvantaged four-year-olds. Currently, it reaches 39 percent of
eligible youths.
   However, the budget will also contain spending cuts and program
slowdowns.
   Veterans will be among the victims of Bush's proposed cutbacks.
Sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the budget
would require veterans to make down payments on VA loans for the
first time _ 4 percent on loans of over $25,000.
   Larry W. Rivers, executive director of the Veterans of Foreign
Wars, called it ``an unreasonable'' proposal that ``dashes the
dreams of countless veterans of participating in the American dream
of home ownership.''
   Bush, who frequently says he wants to be remembered as ``the
education president,'' was proposing a $500 million overall
increase in education spending, but at the expense of some programs.
   For instance, the budget would reduce the Guaranteed Student
Loan program by $500 million, sources said. Another $155 million
would be cut from the Perkins loan program for low-income college
students.
   And although Bush will call for long-term increases in Pell
Grants, another source of money for low-income students, his budget
will reflect a cut in the grants by some $66.5 million for this
coming fall. As a result, more than 1.3 students will either have
their stipends reduced or eliminated, the sources said.
   ``Overall, it's an inadequate investment,'' said Gerald Morris,
deputy director of legislation for the American Federation of
Teachers.
   According to administration and congressional officials, the
budget will also include:
   _The most austere Pentagon budget in more than a decade. Bush
will propose $292 billion in new outlays, up slightly from current
spending but representing a 2 percent cut after adjusting for
inflation. However, the budget will include a request for increased
spending on the Strategic Defense Initiative to $4.8 billion, up
from $3.8 billion this year.
   _More money for fish, wildlife and recreation plus a cutback in
federal timber sales.
   _A new ``family savings account'' that would allow people to
earn tax-free interest and dividends on money that is squirreled
away for at least seven years _ with contributions of up to $5,000
per year per family.
   _No new general tax hikes and a renewal of Bush's call for a
lower capital gains tax rate, a tax credit for adoptions and one
for child care.
   _A $8.5 billion slash in Medicare funds.
   Bush has also announced that he will seek a $1.1 billion
increase, to $10.6 billion, for the war on drugs.
   Some 24,000 of the blue-jacketed, 1,592-page budget documents
are being printed, and they will go on sale on Monday at government
bookshops for $38 apiece.
   But a new government economic report was already raising doubts
about the administration's assertions that the Bush budget would
lower the federal deficit to $64 billion, as required by the
Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law.
   The Commerce Department reported Friday that economic growth in
the last three months of 1989 fell to an annual rate of 0.5 percent
when adjusted for inflation, considerably worse than projected by
the Office of Management and Budget as it put together the economic
assumptions for the new budget.
   The economic figures will make ``total hash'' of the
administration's claims that its spending outline can significantly
reduce the budget deficit, said Michael Evans, president of a
Washington-based economic forecasting service.

<HEAD>Worst River Flooding in Years Washes Our Bridges, Roads and Homes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cold, muddy water of the swollen
Amite River began receding Saturday from washed-out roads, bridges
and flooded homes and officials said they expected heavy damage in
its wake.
   ``It'll be a while before we have any good estimates. We still
can't get into a lot of the places because they're still flooded,''
said Red Cross Disaster Director Bob Hernandez.
   ``All I can tell you is that a lot of people are comparing it to
1983, which was the worst we ever had, and the Red Cross spent
$1.25 million in that one,'' he said.
   In '83, the Amite crested at 40.5 feet near Baton Rouge, the
highest crest in 100 years. The river crested at 39.5 feet
Saturday, Hernandez said.
   No injuries or deaths had been reported in the flooding by
Saturday.
   The floodwaters receded in Baton Rouge and nearby Denham Springs
in the morning. To the south, in Ascension Parish, water didn't
begin falling until later in the day.
   The flooding resulted from heavy rains Wednesday and Thursday
over the Amite River basin, primarily north of Baton Rouge.
   Also, 12 to 15 inches of rain fell in 36 hours last week in the
upper Comite Basin in southwestern Mississippi, which drains to the
Amite and Comite rivers, said Malcolm Moreau of the National
Weather Service in Baton Rouge.
   More than 30 roads and highways in southeastern Louisiana were
closed Saturday because of flooding.
   In the Denham Springs area, almost 150 single-family homes and
house trailers were damaged, an early survey revealed, Hernandez
said.
   ``We know it'll be more than that,'' he said. ``We've just
started looking. Most of what we're seeing is major damage. We had
water up to the tops of trailers, in the second floor of
split-level houses.''
   About half of the approximately 50 homes in one East Baton Rouge
subdivision flooded with up to 3 inches of water. Homeowners
estimated thousands of dollars in damage.
   Most residents left the subdivision late Friday, either taking
their possessions with them or mounting what they could on cinder
blocks.
   ``People knew this flood was coming and prepared for it
beforehand,'' said Hernandez. ``That's going to help keep the
damage to possessions down.''
   The National Weather Service predicted a 20 percent chance of
rain Saturday night and Sunday, but state Department of Public
Works officials did not expect new problems.
   About 38 people spent Friday night in shelters in Denham
Springs, said Don Eisenberg, director of the Baton Rouge chapter of
the Red Cross. He said the shelter would stay open until residents
can make their homes habitable.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Urge Curbs on Tourism in Antarctica</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental group on Saturday urged the
government to protect penguins and other Antarctic wildlife by
regulating companies that take tourists to that ice-bound continent.
   ``Repeated tourist visits will cause animals to abandon their
breeding sites or increase the vulnerability of their eggs and
young to predation,'' Environmental Defense Fund attorney Bruce
Manheim said in a statement.
   The New York-based group issued a report calling on the National
Science Foundation, the State Department and the Coast Guard to
establish a licensing system to ensure no damage to Antarctica from
tour groups.
   ``Although remote and generally inhospitable, Antarctica is now
visited by thousands of tourists each year who wish to see the
continent's pristine environment before it could be despoiled,''
the report said.
   It said ``most tourists are seriously concerned about protecting
Antarctica'' but ``their visits are often localized repetitive and
frequently occur at breeding grounds for penguins, seals and other
seabirds.''
   The report said ``frequent helicopter visits by the first
tourists to Antarctica _ diplomats and dignitaries visiting McMurdo
Station _ quickly resulted in a 50 percent reduction in the
southernmost Adelie Penguin rookery at Cape Royds.''
   It said Antarctic tourism is growing and one Australian company
hopes to develop and a hard-surface runway and luxury hotel on the
continent.
   Currently, however, most of the tour companies are American and
thus the federal government could do much to limit environmental
damage, it said.
   The group urged a ban on aircraft overflights within 1,500
meters of wildlife sites, guidelines on government observation of
wildlife, management plans for wildlife sites, advance information
requirements for expeditions, and coordination of tour visits to
wildlife areas.
   It also called for a monitoring program to assess the impact of
such visits, a ban on the disposal of oil, plastics and garbage
from tour vessels and strict regulation of vessel operations in
waters off Antarctica.
   The report was released on the first anniversary of the
grounding of the Bahia Paraiso, an Argentine tour vessel that
spilled more than 180,000 gallons of oil into wildlife breeding
areas, the report said. ``A year after Antarctica's most
significant environmental disaster, we still don't have regulations
to prevent similar catastrophes,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   Billionaire Sam Walton, who controls
one of the biggest fortunes in America, says he has a better than
even chance of winning his battle with bone cancer.
   Walton, the 71-year-old founder and chairman of Wal-Mart Stores
Inc., has been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a form of bone
cancer and is receiving treatment at M.D. Anderson Hospital in
Houston.
   He returned Friday to his home in Bentonville, where Wal-Mart
keekps its corporate offices, to attend weekend meetings.
   He is scheduled to return to Houston on Monday to resume
chemotherapy and radiation treatments on his back and on his bones,
which he said have become soft and developed holes because of the
cancer.
   Walton said the treatments have been effective and that he has
about a 60 percent chance of recovery from the disease.
   ``I'm getting on a lot better,'' he said Friday. ``I've been on
this treatment for about a week and there seems to be definite
improvement in the way I feel and the way I'm walking.''
   If his current therapy regime does not work, he said, he'll have
to take heavier doses of chemotherapy with greater side effects.
``We're trying to do it with a less-type treatment at this point.''
   Walton, known for making surprise visits to stores in his
popular Wal-Mart discount chain and leading employees and customers
in a ``Give me a W, Give me an A...'' cheer, he was grateful for
the cards and prayers of well-wishers.
   ``I'm one of the real fortunate folks who have people believing
in me and wanting to help and I wish it were that way with
everybody,'' he said.

1991 budget and the Congressional Budget Office.
   The administration estimates were supplied by sources familiar
with the Bush budget who spoke on condition that their names not be

   The CBO estimates, released last Wednesday, forecast higher
deficits because they use less optimistic assumptions about
economic growth. The CBO estimates are also based on no changes in
current budget policies.

followed by the OMB and CBO projections for deficits from 1990

<TEXT>
   Four men who were high-ranking
officials in Nicolae Ceausescu's regime went on trial Saturday on
charges they contributed to the deaths of hundreds of people during
last month's revolution.
   One of the four, former Politburo member Ion Dinca, told the
court he was an accomplice to ``criminal measures'' ordered by
Ceausescu to try to crush the uprising.
   Dinca was the only one of the defendants called to testify
during Saturday's four-hour session, but the prosecution presented
declarations it said were from each of the defendants admitting
their guilt.
   On trial are former Communist Party secretary Emil Bobu; former
Interior Minister Tudor Postelnicu; and former Politburo members
Manea Manescu and Dinca.
   They are charged with complicity in genocide in connection with
the deaths of hundreds of people during the December revolution
that ousted Ceausescu's government and face life in prison at hard
labor if convicted.
   The military prosecutor, Col. Aurel Cosma, said each man could
have prevented the killings of at least 689 people shot to death by
troops by asking Ceausescu to resign. Instead, they backed his
order to shoot protesters, Cosma said before presenting the
declarations purported to be from the accused.
   Cosma did not say when the declarations were given.
   ``I was a beast because I agreed to the orders of Nicolae
Ceausescu,'' said a statement attributed to Postelnicu, 59, who
partly controlled the Securitate secret police. ``I decided to
fight alongside him until the end,'' he said.
   Bobu, considered the No. 3 official in the government behind
Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, was quoted as saying: ``I didn't
take a position. My attitude was contemptible. I was the one who
suggested cremation of the victims in Timisoara'' to hide evidence
of the military action.
   The revolt began in the western city of Timisoara.
   Manescu, 74, was quoted as saying: ``I asked Nicolae Ceausescu
not to resign. I ordered fire with war munitions. I agreed with the
army's repression.''
   ``Everyone with no exception proved to be cowards. We carried
out Ceausescu's orders,'' said Dinca, 62.
   Hundreds of people crowded into a hall at the Romanian Military
Academy in Bucharest to view the trial, the first of former
Ceausescu associates since the dictator and his wife were tried in
secret on genocide charges and executed Christmas Day.
   The defendants entered the dock without handcuffs, guarded by
two armed policemen. Postelnicu appeared on the verge of tears.
   Prosecuting Ceausescu loyalists is a key test of the provisional
government, which is struggling to gain the support of the people
before free elections in May.
   The trial opened one day after the vice president of the
provisional government resigned, claiming that ``Stalinist
methods'' were being used by the nation's new leaders.
   The charges referred to Ceausescu and his wife as the
``authors'' of the genocide but said the four defendants did not
act to block the Ceausescus and therefore were guilty of complicity.
   One of the issues raised at the session was of the events that
led to security forces being ordered to open fire on demonstrators.
   Dinca, in his testimony, said he and four other Politburo
members opposed the president's demand that they shoot at
protesters and told Ceausescu so at a Politburo meeting Dec. 17.
   ``It was the first time that Ceausescu met with opposition from
the Politburo,'' he said. ``He got up from the council table, very
nervous, and said, `Will you please elect another general secretary
if you don't agree with me.'''
   Dinca said some Politburo members then gave their support to
Ceausescu, who went ahead with the orders to shoot protesters.
   ``I consider myself his accomplice in what he did,'' Dinca said.
``If any of us had tried to oppose him, others would have allied
with us and we would have managed to convince him to give up such
an order.''
   He added: ``I didn't have the courage. I didn't do it because of
cowardice.''
   ``I gave my help to Ceausescu to put into practice the criminal
measures to suffocate in blood the justified revolution of the
people,'' he said.
   The revolution was justified, he said, because Romanians were
deprived of basic human rights, food, medicine and energy to heat
their homes.
   Ceausescu forced Romania's 23 million people to endure
hardships, exporting food and energy supplies for heating, as he
sought to pay off Romania's $10 billion foreign debt.
   On Dec. 22, Dinca said, Ceausescu called an emergency Politburo
meeting and asked if anyone objected to the steps he was taking to
crush the revolt, which by then had spread to Bucharest and other
cities.
   ``Everybody there said they would fight to the end,'' Dinca said.
   By then, Defense Minister Vasile Milea, who had refused to shoot
at protesters, had himself been shot to death by pro-Ceausescu
forces.
   The Ceausescus boarded a helicopter to flee Bucharest on Dec.
22. They were caught and executed Christmas Day after being
convicted of genocide and ruining the economy. The death penalty
has since been outlawed.
   Under questioning from Cosma, Dinca said Milea told Ceausescu on
Dec. 17 that he had examined all the military regulations and
``didn't find anywhere that the armed forces should shoot the
people.''
   Before Dinca finished testifying, his three co-defendants were
asked if they had any questions for him. Manescu and Bobu said no.
   But Postelnicu, referring to shorthand transcripts of the
Politburo meetings, said: ``I think there are many lies in these
papers.''
   The tribunal president, Col. Andrei Nitoui, said Postelnicu
could say more about that when he testifies.
   Nitoui adjourned the tribunal until Monday.

   Welders on Saturday cut down the word
``Lenin'' from the sign over the gates to the shipyard where the
Solidarity movement was born and removed a statue of the Soviet
Communist founder from the plant.
   The tributes to Vladimir I. Lenin had remained at the
state-owned shipyard even after Solidarity had forced the
Communists to give up power in Poland following parliamentary
elections last year.
   Workers, laughing and applauding, removed the Lenin sign as the
Polish Communists were gathering in Warsaw for a last national
congress that is expected to create a new party with a new name and
program.
   ``May this symbolic act be proof of the irreversibility of the
changes in our country, a warning for those who led us to so many
disasters,'' said Zbigniew Lis, head of the Solidarity commission
at the yard.
   ``We got rid of a symbol the working class never identified
with,'' he said.
   The Solidarity committee decided to restore the old name, the
Gdansk Shipyard, as part of plans to create a joint stock company
at the complex. The yard had been renamed the Lenin Shipyard 23
years ago.
   The then-Communist government announced in 1988 that the yard
would be closed because it was unprofitable. Lech Walesa, the
shipyard electrician who has led the union since 1980, denounced
that decision as politically motivated.
   Plans for a Polish-born American heiress, Barbara
Piasecka-Johnson, to invest up to $100 million in the yard fell
through when workers would not agree to her offer.
   The Solidarity-led government now announced plans to create a
stock corporation from the state-owned shipyard whose shares would
eventually be sold to investors.

   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians clashed
with police in the troubled Kosovo province Saturday, and
opposition groups appealed for negotiations and free elections as a
solution to ending ethnic tensions.
   Police used tear gas and truncheons to disperse stone-throwing
demonstrators in protests that broke out in several Kosovo towns
Saturday. According to Radio Belgrade, shots may have been fired by
both sides.
   The state Tanjug news agency reported several injuries in the
clashes. Belgrade radio reported that up to five people may have
died, but the reports could not be confirmed.
   Protests broke out in the province Tuesday. On Wednesday, riot
police used tear gas and a water cannon to disperse about 40,000
ethnic Albanians who demonstrated in Pristina, the provincial
capital, to protest alleged human rights abuses in Kosovo.
   According to Tanjug, protests broke out Saturday in the
provincial towns of Urosevac, Pec, Orahovac, Podujevo, Suva Reka,
Prizren, and Brestovac.
   A source reached by telephone in Orahovac, about 31 miles
southwest of Pristina, told The Associated Press that demonstrators
threw stones at police in nearby Brestovac.
   Radio Belgrade reported that police fired tear gas there, and
reportedly reverted to shooting after allegedly being fired at by
demonstrators.
   In Pec, about 31 miles west of Pristina, Tanjug said about 2,000
people took part in what it described as ``very aggressive
demonstrations.''
   It said protesters built barricades and set a car belonging to
the Communist Party headquarters on fire. It said several other
cars were damaged.
   Belgrade television reported the Pec demonstrators were
dispersed and that ``very strong security units'' were maintaining
calm in the streets.
   According to media reports, shots were fired in Pec during
protests there Friday, and Tanjug Saturday quoted Pec police chief
Aslan Slamniku as saying five policemen were injured Friday.
   Earlier Saturday, ethnic Albanian opposition groups had demanded
an end to ``police repression'' and appealed for demonstrations to
stop, saying they would ``only give authorities a justification for
more repression.''
   In their crackdown against the protests ``Kosovo authorities
have once again demonstrated ... the lack of minimal willingness to
tackle social problems through dialogue,'' said a joint statement
by the region's three newly-formed independent opposition groups.
   About 100 Kosovo Albanians were arrested in the wake of this
week's unrest. Protesters were demanding the release of political
prisoners and the lifting of a partial state of emergency in the
province imposed last year.
   At least 28 people died in violence that erupted in the province
last year, after constitutional changes were passed limiting the
region's autonomy. The largest republic of Serbia, of which Kosovo
is an administrative part, gained near-total control over the
region.
   Albanians make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's 1.9 million
people.
   The opposition statement urged Kosovo residents to sign a
petition detailing their demands for democratic reforms in the
country's most economically underdeveloped region.
   The main points on the petition would establish ``the conditions
for the creation of parliamentary democracy in Kosovo, prevent a
new spiral of violence,'' said Veton Surroi, a spokesman for the
opposition.
   The Serb minority in the province has claimed harrassment by the
ethnic Albanian majority there, and authorities have said the
partial state of emergency was necessary to protect the minority.
   The petition calls for the lifting of emergency measures in
Kosovo, the freeing of all political prisoners, free elections and
freedom of the press.
   Yugoslavia's federal government has promised to permit the first
free multi-party elections in communist Yugoslavia next April.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir promised Saturday
to withstand U.S. pressures for concessions on Middle East peace
issues.
   He also threatened _ for the second time in a week _ to resign
from his job if he loses a party vote of confidence.
   In the West Bank, soldiers shot and killed two Palestinians on
Saturday in a clash with stone-throwers in the village of Abu Dis,
Arab reports said.
   The army confirmed a clash in the village and said it began when
border guards ``came upon masked activists.'' At least one
protester was wounded, an army spokesman said.
   Officials at Muqassed Hospital in East Jerusalem confirmed the
deaths.Arab reports identified the victims as Abdullah Nabil
Halabiya, 16, and his uncle, Mohammed Dahoud Halabiya, 45.
   Their deaths raised to 651 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israelis in the 25-month-old uprising against Israeli rule. Another
174 Arabs have been slain by fellow Palestinians for alleged
collaboration with Israel, and 43 Israelis have died in the
violence.
   Soldiers also clashed with protesters in the Gaza Strip, and
Arab reports said five Palestinians were shot and wounded.
   An unidentified reservist combat captain was dismissed Saturday
after an investigation found he violated regulations in the
shooting of a 5-year-old Palestinian boy Jan. 23 near the West Bank
town of Jenin, Israel TV said.
   The boy, Mohammed Kadaha, was seriously wounded by a rubber
bullet that hit him in the head as soldiers dispersed
stone-throwing protesters.
   In threatening to resign Saturday, Shamir said in an army radio
interview he ``understood that if the top institution of Likud
doesn't accept the policy of Likud's leader, then I can no longer
fill this position.''
   Shamir leads the right-wing Likud bloc.
   The Likud meeting has been called for Feb. 7 by Industry
Minister Ariel Sharon to debate his objections to Israel's plan to
hold elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as part of
an interim peace settlement.
   Sharon holds that the U.S.-backed plan could jeopardize Israel's
claim to these lands captured in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Shamir said last week he would step down if Sharon and his
backers undermined party support for Israel's peace plan.
   This time, Shamir added he would insist on a separate vote for
his proposals, suggesting that rejecting Sharon's recommendations
would not be enough to satisfy him.
   The party infighting has delayed efforts by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III to convene Egyptian and Israeli foreign
ministers in Washington.
   Baker's planned meeting is supposed to help prepare
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue in Cairo on Israel's election proposal
for Arabs in the occupied lands.
   Also delaying Baker's plans is disagreement over which
Palestinians may participate in peace talks. Israel has ruled out
any role for the Palestine Liberation Organization, but
Palestinians consider the PLO their sole representative.
   Shamir said high-ranking American officials have assured him
that the Bush administration never authorized recent published
suggestions to reduce financial assistance to Israel.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole introduced the idea of cutting
aid to Israel at a news conference Jan. 16. Dole suggested a 5
percent cut to large recipients, including Israel, which receives
$3 billion a year.
   Dole's remarks were interpreted in Israel as new pressure on
Shamir to ease his stand on peace talks.

<NOTE>EDS: SUBS 10th graf pvs, bgng: It could, with 2 grafs to UPDATE
with FAA comment on safety upgrades on foreign airliners</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air disasters such as the Avianca Airlines
crash on Long Island last week are becoming more survivable, in
part because design and technical advances have made jet travel
safer, many air safety experts say.
   ``The accident rate is improving. It's not more dangerous, it's
getting better,'' says S. Harry Robertson, director of the Crash
Research Institute in Tempe, Ariz. ``Airplanes are getting safer as
the newer generations come along. The rate of improvement is very
significant.''
   Capt. Ed Arbon, who flew for 22 years with TWA and is now an
official of the Flight Safety Foundation, agrees.
   ``Some of the recent improvements do make the modern aircraft
more survivable,'' Arbon says.
   ``Eighty to 85 percent of recent crashes are survivable,'' says
Drucella Anderson, a spokeswoman for the National Transportation
Safety Board. ``A lot of safeguards have been built into the
planes.''
   Eighty-nine of the 161 passengers _ more than half _ survived
the crash of Avianca Flight 52 into a hill on the north shore of
Long Island.
   Preliminary inquiries suggest the craft had either run out of
fuel or had a very low supply when it crashed Thursday night on its
way to John F. Kennedy International Airport. There was no fire
when the 23-year-old Boeing 707 crashed.
   But many of the experts say that the battle for air safety is
far from over even though air travel on the whole has become
amazingly safe and millions of passengers are transported each year
without incident.
   Under new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration
and prompted by the investigation of air crashes, passenger seats
are being strengthened and have been covered with fire blocking
material. The allowable level of toxic smoke and fumes from burning
aircraft materials also has been reduced, and exit doors have been
made more reliable to avoid jamming.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said Avianca, like other foreign
airlines, would have been required to make some safety upgrades,
such as providing fire-retardant seat covers and lavatory smoke
alarms, but it would not have been required to strengthen seats.
   The latter requirements still are being adopted for foreign
airliners, Farrar said.
   Arbon says that by the nature of its technology, the modern jet
passenger liner is a far safer plane than the piston aircraft it
replaced.
   ``We used to lose engines frequently,'' he said. ``The jetliner
has a very reliable power plant. It also has a good guidance
system, a good auto pilot; the electronics are much more reliable.''
   Robertson says improvements are continuing on ``the ways in
which airplanes are informed as to what is going on and how people
on the ground control them.''
   An example, he says, is the wind shear blamed for the August
1985 crash of a Delta airliner near the Dallas-Ft. Worth airport.
   ``The people in the tower had no idea of what was going on,'' he
contends. ``Today they have better sensors out there. So that is
improving.''
   Arbon said some 70 percent of today's accidents are due to ``the
human factor,'' adding that it is there that the strongest efforts
for improvement are now being made.
   Ms. Anderson says the NTSB dates many of the improvements in air
safety to the recommendations made after its investigation of the
deadly fire on June 2, 1983, aboard an Air Canada jetliner en route
from Texas to Toronto.
   Twenty-three people died aboard the plane, which made an
emergency landing at the Greater Cincinnati Airport. Some suffered
fatal burns. Others died of smoke inhalation.
   The recommendations led to the installation of fire blocking
covers on passenger seats on all commercial aircraft with 30 or
more seats, automatic fire extinguishers in lavatories, halon fire
extinguishers in the cockpit, smoke detectors in lavatories and new
rules on cabin materials to make the cabin interiors more flame
resistant and less likely to emit toxic gases, Ms. Anderson said.
   But there are some clouds on the safety horizon.
   For example, Robertson said that while seats have been made
stronger to resist the impact of a crash, the floor beneath them
has not.
   ``Before the changes the seats were folding over,'' he said.
``But when the seat is stiff it makes it easier to break it off the
floor.''
   ``So they sometimes do pop off the floor,'' he said and added:
``Maybe this step in the right direction is going to backfire.''
   Modern technology may also have reduced the protection offered
by the ``protective cocoon'' or fuselage of a jetliner, Robinson
says.
   Today's planes are made from high-strength aluminum to hold down
weight. But Robertson says the resulting fuselage is brittle.
   ``They shatter, and sharp fragments lie all over the crash
site,'' he says. ``Earlier generations of aircraft would crush,
buckle and wrinkle, but the box was still there. They are losing
that cocoon protection.''
   Robertson, whose institute has been engaged in the study of air
crashes for more than 30 years, says air disasters can be divided
into three categories.
   These range from the airborne equivalent of fender-benders _
posing small risk to those on board _ to deadly accidents in which
all or most of the passengers and crew are killed.
   But it is the third category _ middle-ground accidents in which
some are killed but many survive _ which pose an opportunity, the
safety experts say.
   ``The aim is to take that middle ground and expand it,'' thus
reducing the number of totally deadly accidents, Robertson said.
``It is in fact being expanded.''
   Robertson cites recent studies in which experts were asked what
could be done to significantly improve air safety in the year 2000
and beyond.
   ``They said you could probably make the best contribution to
safety if you can figure out a way to slow the planes enough to
allow them to land at half the speed you do now,'' Robertson said,
adding that might prove difficult to achieve.
   ``But if you can cut the speed in half you can make the greatest
contribution to safety _ that's absolutely correct,'' he said.

   Mayor David Dinkins will have his own at-bat in
the campaign to keep the Yankees in the Bronx.
   Dinkins and Yankees owner George Steinbrenner met Friday at City
Hall and agreed to renew discussion of the fate of the team that
Steinbrenner has hinted at moving to New Jersey when the Yankee
Stadium lease expires in 2002.
   ``Let's face it. The public perception is that there isn't
enough parking, ingress and egress is too slow, and there is even
perceptions about safety,'' Dinkins said.
   ``We have to do some new and unique things to get people there _
one of which is to give them a winning team,'' Dinkins said.
   Former Mayor Edward I. Koch had all but nailed down a 30-year
extension on the Yankee lease, but Steinbrenner said they could not
agree on such amenities as VIP suites and a restaurant with a view
of the ballfield.

<HEAD>Suspects Arrested in Killing of Salvadoran Politician</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six Guatemalans have been arrested in the
slaying of a leftist Salvadoran politician and a Guatemalan
attorney, who were kidnapped in the capital and shot to death,
police said Saturday.
   Police said the suspects were caught with a cache of weapons,
including a .32-caliber pistol similar to the one used to kill the
victims.
   Guillermo Mollinedo, a spokesman for Guatemala's national
police, said the six Guatemalans also were suspected of robbing
public buses, stealing weapons from the presidential guard and arms
trafficking.
   Mollinedo said they were arrested in Puerto Barrios on the
Caribbean coast, 180 miles northeast of Guatemala City. He did not
say when the arrests occurred or provide any further information on
the suspects.
   In Guatemala, suspects must appear before a judge within six
hours to be charged or released. The police did not say whether
they had been charged.
   The bodies of Hector Oqueli Colindres, 45, the deputy
secretary-general of the leftist National Revolutionary Movement in
El Salvador, and Guatemalan lawyer Gilda Flores Arevalo were found
Jan. 13 in Jalpatagua, a city east of Guatemala City on the road to
El Salvador. They had been shot in the head.
   Oqueli and Flores Arevalo were kidnapped a day earlier while
driving to Guatemala City's airport, where Oqueli was to board a
flight for Managua. He was to help monitor preparations for the
Nicaraguan election Feb. 25.
   His political party said both were kidnapped by armed men.
   No one claimed responsibility for the killings. Leftist
political leaders in Guatemala and El Salvador said they believed
Salvadoran and Guatemalan right-wing death squads were responsible.
   President Vinicio Cerezo appointed a commission of top military
and civilian officials to investigate, and said he would personally
supervise the panel's work.
   The slayings came at a time of increasing political violence in
El Salvador and Guatemala, where rightist factions have
longstanding ties.
   Oqueli was a deputy foreign minister in El Salvador from October
1979 until March 1980, when a military coup overthrew the
government.
   Like many other leftists, he fled El Salvador after the coup but
returned in 1987 to participate in politics.
   He left again in November, as did many Salvadoran leftists,
under protection of the Venezuelan Embassy after he was threatened
during a major offensive by the leftist Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front guerrillas.
   He had reportedly planned to return home Jan. 20.

<HEAD>Social Philosopher Lewis Mumford Dead at 94</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMENIA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lewis Mumford, a critic of architecture and
urban planning whose writings warned of the decline of cities and
the dehumanizing influence of technology, has died at age 94.
   Mumford, who died in his sleep Friday afternoon, ``was frail,
but there was no sickness. It was simply a matter of old age,''
said his grandson James Morss.
   Mumford, best known for his writing on the subject of cities and
culture, was the author of more than 30 books, including ``The City
in History,'' for which he received the National Book Award in 1961.
   Morss said his grandfather spent the last few years quietly,
passing the days with his wife and doing some light reading.
   Mumford was among 12 artists, including composer Aaron Copland
and film director Frank Capra, awarded the National Medal of Arts
by President Reagan in a White House ceremony in 1986. Recipients
were honored for their lifetime contributions to American arts.
   The illegitimate son of a businessman, Mumford was born in
Queens on Oct. 19, 1895, but grew up on the West Side of Manhattan.
   He attended City College, but ill health prevented him from
completing his degree. Instead, he took graduate courses at
Columbia University and at the New School for Social Research.
   It was then that he discovered the works of Sir Patrick Geddes,
a Scottish town planner whose influence he said was the most
important one in his life.
   After serving as a naval radio technician in World War I,
Mumford became associate editor of The Dial magazine. His essays on
housing and urban matters led him to become acting editor of The
Sociological Review.
   Mumford co-founded the Regional Planning Association of America
in 1923 and served on the staff of the New York Housing and
Regional Planning Commission.
   In 1938, Mumford published ``The Culture of Cities,'' a book
that traced the history of cities in the modern world and set forth
proposals for their improvement. The book made his international
reputation and put him on the cover of Time magazine.
   He was among the earliest and most prescient critics of highways
in Manhattan. In 1943, he wrote that ``express highways would be
admirable if they were related to anything except the desire, on
the part of the more prosperous, to get out of New York as fast as
possible; actually, their function is to increase the planless
decentralization of the metropolis and thereby pile up such a load
of decaying properties in the center as to hasten the final
exodus.''
   In addition to his writings on urban issues, he wrote a weekly
art column for The New Yorker. At the same time he published the
first of four volumes in what became known as the ``Renewal of
Life'' series.
   A social philosopher and educator, Mumford implored people to
place a higher value on human feelings and morals than on
dehumanizing technology. He feared that science and technology
would eventually lead to ``a uniform, all-enveloping superplanetary
structure, designed for automatic operation.''
   Man, he said, will then ``have not only conquered nature, but
detached himself as far as possible from organic habitat.''
   He is survived by his wife, Sophia; daughter Alison Mumford
Morss, of Amenia; and two grandchildren, James, of New York City
and Elizabeth of Troy, N.Y.

<HEAD>Bush Budget To Claim Big Deficit Cut, But Economic Assumptions
Faulted</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Inserts new 2nd graf to provide more budget details; picks up
3rd graf pvs ``The budget ...''

<TEXT>
   President Bush's $1.23 trillion budget, due to
be unveiled Monday, will seek to slash the federal deficit in half
in 1991, administration sources said Saturday, in a spending plan
based on pared-down defense outlays and optimistic economic
assumptions.
   Bush, sticking to his campaign pledge, will meet his deficit
goal without a general tax increase, opting instead to save
billions of dollars through trimming a variety of government
programs, ranging from Medicare to college student loans.
   The budget document, Bush's first solo effort to reorder the
government's spending priorities, also will contain a somewhat
whimsical overview written by Budget Director Richard G. Darman,
who likens the federal budget to the ``Ultimate Cookie Monster'' _
the voracious gremlin on the ``Sesame Street'' television program.
   With a generally rosy set of assumptions about economic growth
and with a host of proposed cuts in military and domestic spending
programs, the administration projects that the deficit for 1991
will be reduced to $63.1 billion, just under the $64 billion
deficit target established in the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction
law.
   The administration projects a deficit for the current fiscal
year of $123.8 billion, far above the Gramm-Rudman target of $100
billion, according to officials who have seen the budget
projections and who spoke on condition that their names not be used.
   The budget forecasts the deficit will be reduced to $25.1
billion in 1992 and will actually show a surplus of $5.7 billion in
1993, the year the Gramm-Rudman law calls for a balanced budget. It
projects further surpluses of $10.7 billion in 1994 and $9.4
billion in 1995.
   Former President Ronald Reagan also submitted budgets showing
surpluses down the road, but the surpluses never materialized
because the economic assumptions upon which the revenue and
spending forecasts were based proved too optimistic and Congress
balked at going along with many of the program cuts.
   Many analysts believe a similar fate will befall the 1991 Bush
budget, the president's first complete spending blueprint. Last
February, he released a 193-page set of amendments to Reagan's
final budget.
   Even before its release, the Bush administration's assumptions
about economic growth were being called into question. The
Congressional Budget Office, projecting lower economic growth and
thus lower government tax revenues, is estimating higher deficits
and thus the need for sharper cuts for 1991 and following years.
   Bush's 1991 budget, for the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1,
proposes total spending of $1.233 trillion and expects government
receipts will total $1.170 trillion, leaving a deficit of $63.1
billion.
   In his budget, Bush will propose using a portion of the surplus
revenues in coming years to set up a ``Social Security Integrity
and Debt Reduction Fund'' which would reduce the $2.8 trillion
federal debt and ``thus leave a more manageable financing burden
for future generations,'' according to Darman's overview.
   The fund is the administration's effort to derail a politically
popular proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to roll
back Social Security tax increases this year and in 1992.
   The budget does not include any proposed general tax increase,
continuing to honor Bush's no-new-taxes campaign pledge. To honor
another 1988 pledge, Bush will once again seek to slash taxes on
capital gains _ the profits resulting from the sale of stock or
other assets. That effort is certain to generate partisan wrangling
on Capitol Hill.
   To deflect arguments that the capital gains reduction is a tax
cut for the wealthy, Bush will unveil a proposed ``family savings
account'' which would allow people to earn tax-free interest and
dividends on money invested for at least seven years _ with
contributions of up to $5,000 per year per family.
   Among the budget cuts, Bush will propose to trim $8.5 billion
from projected spending on Medicare, the huge health plan for
Social Security recipients. The money would be saved by lowering
payments to hospitals and doctors, not by curbing patient benefits.
   Seeking to capitalize on the lowered East-West tensions, the
administration is proposing a pared-down Pentagon budget with
outlays totaling $292.1 billion, up slightly from this year, but
representing a 2 percent cut after adjusting for inflation.
   The 1991 budget proposes reducing active duty military personnel
by 38,000, cutting civilian Defense Department employment by 5,000
and reducing the reserves by 3,000, while protecting some of
administration's pet programs, such as the Strategic Defense
Initiative, the nuclear shield in space commonly called Star Wars.
   ``By 1995, defense spending will be at its lowest level,
measured either as a share of (the total economy) or as a portion
of total federal spending, since before World War II,'' Defense
Secretary Richard Cheney said in a Pentagon budget document
obtained by The Associated Press from congressional sources.
   To help meet the trimmed down spending levels, Cheney is
scheduled to unveil on Monday a sweeping list of proposed military
base closures and reductions over the next five years, targeting
installations from Philadelphia to Long Beach, Calif.
   Cheney's moves have already prompted cries of protest from
members of Congress who have been briefed on which installations
are on the ``hit list.''
   Darman complains that Congress has widely inflated expectations
of how much in government resources will be freed up from the
so-called peace dividend resulting from the reduced Soviet threat
in Eastern Europe.
   ``This great historical shift has been almost trivialized in its
translation into public debate about the budget. The issue has been
framed as: `How big is the peace dividend?' _ and, in effect, `How
can I get mine?''' Darman wrote in his essay, first reported in
Saturday's New York Times.
   Darman's colorful essay, titled ``The Director's Introduction to
the Budget,'' offers a tour of the budget ``wonderland'' with
references to the budget as the ``Ultimate Cookie Monster.''
   ``Its excessive tendencies toward consumption are not exactly
ennobling,'' Darman writes.
   He also likens many huge government spending programs to the
popular video game ``Pac Man,'' as they wait to ``spring forward
and consume another line of resource dots in the budget maze.''
   The 1,592-page Bush budget, bound with a blue cover, will go on
sale Monday at government bookstores for $38.

   Armed nationalists battled troops in southern
Azerbaijan, leaving five people dead, but other nationalist
fighters agreed to withdraw from a tense section of the
Armenian-Azerbaijani border, Tass said Saturday.
   A truce along that part of the border was said to be holding,
and the Interior Ministry reported exchanges of hostages between
Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
   Troops made scores of arrests Saturday to crush what the
official Soviet news agency called the ``criminal military
structure of the People's Front of Azerbaijan.''
   The People's Front offered to negotiate with Soviet officials, a
spokesman for the movement said by telephone late Saturday from
Baku, the republic's capital. It offered to maintain order, call
off strikes and get workers to work double shifts to make up for
lost production.
   It was unlikely that the Soviet government would agree to those
terms, however.
   The Soviet defense minister, Dmitri T. Yazov, said last week
that soldiers and security forces were intent on rooting out a
nationalist network from factories and state-run institutions.
   But another leader of the People's Front, Kh. Hajizade, said in
a telephone interview from Baku that the group's loose structure of
small independent units was keeping the front alive. ``The People's
Front continues to operate whether or not its leadership is
arrested,'' he said.
   Hajizade said the front also stood ready to discuss the removal
of Soviet soldiers, the fate of reform in the republic and other
issues.
   Most of Baku was still reported on strike Saturday to demand the
withdrawal of Soviet soldiers who entered the city Jan. 20.
   Tass quoted Baku's military commandant, Lt. Gen. Vladimir
Dubnyak, as saying 125 people, including 27 police and soldiers,
have died since troops seized control in Baku. That raised the
death toll since ethnic violence began Jan. 13 in Baku to 197.
   Dubnyak did not provide further details on the figures. It was
not clear how many of the deaths occurred in the assault on Baku on
Jan. 20, or whether the figures included the five deaths in the
battle in the southern region of Gaftona.
   One soldier was among those killed in the clash between soldiers
and armed nationalists near the Caspian Sea, Tass said. Four others
were wounded and 54 people were arrested, Tass said. It did not say
what day the clash occurred.
   Tass also reported the arrests of 80 people in Lenkoran and 22
in nearby Neftechala. Another 35 people, Armenians and
Azerbaijanis, were arrested outside Kirkidzhan, the main city of
the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region in Azerbaijan, Tass said.
   The national daily newspaper Trud, quoting military reports,
said more than 1,000 military uniforms and a large cache of arms
were seized in headquarters of the People's Front, along with
telephone lists, bank passbooks, passports and other belongings of
Armenians who were victims of ethnic attacks.
   Those attacks evolved into a fight for secession by militants in
Azerbaijan, a predominantly Shiite Moslem republic.
   Rakhmi Gadzhiyev, identified as a leader of the pro-independence
Azerbaijani People's Front and a member of the National Defense
Committee, the front's militant wing, was among those arrested, the
news agency Tass said.
   Forty more members of nationalist groups linked to the People's
Front were arrested, another newspaper, Komsomolskaya Pravda,
quoted police Lt. Col. A. Sorokovikh in Baku as saying.
   But newspapers said Front leaders had gone underground and were
preparing ``new mass disorders.''
   Nearly 150 people were detained in Baku overnight, most for
violating curfew, the reports said.
   Tass reported that negotiators meeting along the border between
Armenia and the Nakhichevan region of Azerbaijan had agreed to
remove all armed men by Sunday morning.
   The two sides may have unarmed patrols of no more than 10 men on
the roads nearby, according to the agreement. Meeting in the
Armenian border town of Eraskh, the two sides agreed Thursday on a
cease-fire.
   Tass said the two sides exchanged 17 Armenian hostages for 22
Azerbaijani hostages.
   But Rafael Popoyan, an Armenian delegate, reported from the
Armenian capital, Yerevan, that shooting from the Azerbaijani side
had been reported Saturday during a continuation of the talks.
   The ethnic attacks in Baku on Jan. 13 started the latest
flare-up in violence in the Caucasus republics of Armenia and
Azerbaijan, which are disputing control of the mountainous
Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.
   The population of Nagorno-Karabakh is predominantly Armenian and
is demanding to be united with Armenia.
   Officials of the People's Front organizations of the three
Baltic republics announced that officials from analogous movements
in Armenia and Azerbaijan had agreed to travel to Latvia for
possible peace talks.
   But the Azerbaijanis said they would negotiate only if the
Armenians did not bring up claims to Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov told Soviet journalists on
Friday that the army had moved into Baku past barricades of heavily
armed nationalists to stop a drive to transfer power to the
People's Front.
   He said the soldiers and security forces were intent on rooting
out a nationalist network from factories and state institutions.
   Yazov said the Soviet military estimates there are 40,000
well-armed nationalists still loose in the republic.
   Five hundred buses were back on the road in Azerbaijan, and the
restoration of full service was expected soon, it said.
   In Baku, some stores were beginning to open, although there were
shortages of supplies and long lines. Television broadcasts resumed
for the first time in a week but more than 400 enterprises were at
a standstill, reports said.

<HEAD>Prison Quarters Being Built for Noriega, Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction work that goes on even at night at a
federal prison southwest of Miami has sparked rumors that Manuel
Noriega will be moved there from his courthouse basement quarters.
   Lawyers visiting clients at the suburban Metropolitan
Correctional Center said they have seen work being done under
floodlights and two windows have been filled with cinder blocks in
an interview room.
   A prison official who spoke on condition of anonymity said a
holding area intended for Noriega has been under construction, was
being painted Saturday and could be ready for his transfer as early
as Sunday.
   But Angel Montalvo, a prison duty officer, said the construction
was routine and part of ongoing expansion at the 280-acre facility,
which houses about 1,200 prisoners.
   Federal prisoners held for trial in Miami normally are held at
the fenced center run by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, but the
deposed Panamanian leader has been confined in a courthouse
apartment since he was flown from Panama Jan. 4.
   The U.S. Marshals Service, which holds responsibility for
Noriega in the courthouse, and federal prison officials refuse as a
matter of policy to publicly discuss any prisoner moves.
   Defense attorneys have been assured ready access to their
high-profile client, but they are barred from divulging any
confidential matters in the case, such as preparations for a move.
   Noriega, dressed in his general's uniform, appeared before U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler on Friday claiming he was a
prisoner of war illegally captured in the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   The legal argument is given little chance of success because
courts have consistently upheld the government's right to prosecute
foreign defendants once they are in this country, no matter how
they were brought to the jurisdiction. The doctrine, outlined in
1856, was based on a capture by a bounty hunter in Peru.
   In another development, two co-defendants named with Noriega in
a February 1988 drug indictment planned Monday to renew their bids
for release on bond before Hoeveler.
   The government is appealing a $1 million bond set for accused
drug-money pilot Daniel Miranda, who had a bondsman on hand to
obtain his release at a hearing Jan. 12. Miranda remained in
custody when the prosecution appealed.
   In the other case, an attorney representing Luis del Cid, a
former Noriega aide accused of money laundering, will argue that
the government has confused him with a different man named Mario
del Cid.
   Luis del Cid appears in a photograph with Noriega and Cuban
President Fidel Castro in Havana. But his attorney, Samuel Burstyn,
argues the government knows del Cid never took part in any
conferences in which Castro purportedly acted as a mediator in
talks between Noriega and Colombian cocaine cartel leaders.

<HEAD>East Germany Welcomes Foreign Observers to May Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's Communists said Saturday they
would welcome international supervision to ensure fairness in the
country's first free elections.
   A front-page editorial in the party daily Neues Deutschland said
having a team of foreign observers monitor the campaign and the May
6 elections would be ``good and practical.''
   It urged opposition groups to accept the proposal, which has
been introduced in Parliament by interim President Manfred Gerlach,
a member of one of the non-Communist parties in Premier Hans
Modrow's coalition government.
   ``Even if all precautions are taken for free and fair elections,
an additional safeguard cannot hurt,'' Neues Deutschland said.
   Joachim Herrmann, 61, a former Politburo member who controlled
the state media in the ousted hard-line leadership of Erich
Honecker, meanwhile became the latest disgraced top official to be
arrested, a week after his expulsion from the Communist Party.
   The official news agency ADN said prosecutors were investigating
whether he could be tried for high treason. It quoted a statement
by the chief prosecutor's office as saying the probe was based on
his alleged ``responsibility for the unconstitutional media policy
of past years.''
   Herrmann was the top propaganda official in the now-dissolved
Communist Party Central Committee, a post through which the
Communists controlled national media, including television and
radio.
   The prosecutor's office also issued an arrest warrant for
Gerhard Schuerer, former head of the State Planning Commission, on
corruption charges, ADN said. Schuerer was expelled from the party
last week.
   New Forum, the largest opposition movement and one of the most
diffuse, on Saturday began a two-day congress in East Berlin to
chart its course in preparation for the May elections.
   Opposition groups on Friday accepted Modrow's offer to join the
government, but only if all Cabinet members renounce their politcal
affiliations.
   A new group, the German Forum Party, began preparing for the
elections by opening its founding congress in Karl-Marx-Stad
Saturday.
   A delegate, Frank-Thomas Heinze, said the party will advocate
free market concepts and German unity, according to ADN.

   President Bush, hoping to derail support for a
Social Security tax cut, will offer as an alternative a proposal to
use the growing Social Security surpluses to reduce the national
debt, administration officials said Saturday.
   The officials said the administration would spell out the
workings of the proposal as part of Bush's 1991 budget, which will
be released Monday.
   According to the officials, who spoke on condition that their
names not be used, the debt reduction would work in the following
way:
   The budget will call for creation of a ``Social Security
Integrity and Debt Reduction Fund'' to be administered by the
Treasury Department.
   The money for the fund would come from revenues collected by the
government beginning in 1993, the year the administration projects
the budget will finally enjoy a small surplus of $5.7 billion.
   The Bush proposal would call for the fund to receive an amount
equal to 15 percent of the surplus that year in the Social Security
trust fund. The contribution would rise to 50 percent of the Social
Security trust fund surplus in 1994, to 85 percent in 1995 and
finally 100 percent from 1996 through the year 2000.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Social
Security surplus, the amount collected in payroll taxes above what
is paid out in benefits, will total $98 billion in 1993, rising to
$112 billion in 1994 and $128 billion in 1995.
   The portion of the surplus funds flowing into the debt reduction
account would be used to reduce the federal debt, which now stands
at $2.8 trillion.
   By reducing the debt, Budget Director Richard G. Darman writes
in a budget overview to be released Monday, policymakers would be
leaving ``a more manageable financing burden for future
generations.''
   The federal debt is the sum of all of the annual deficits. Since
the government has not had a surplus for 30 years, the Treasury
must add to the national debt by borrowing more each year.
   The administration's plan assumes that the deficit reduction
targets spelled out in the Gramm-Rudman law will be met and the
government will start running surpluses in 1993.
   However, former President Reagan also forecast surpluses in
future years only to see those assumptions fail to occur because of
slower economic growth and the unwillingness of Congress to go
along with his recommended cuts in domestic programs.
   The administration's proposal for dealing with the Social
Security surpluses is a recognition of the growing support for a
proposal by Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., to reduce the Social
Security tax paid by workers and their employers by $62 billion
over the next two years.
   Moynihan wants to cut this year's 7.65 percent Social Security
payroll tax back to last year's 7.51 percent rate and also cancel a
further increase scheduled for next year.
   Bush has called the Moynihan proposal a ``charade'' that could
lead to an eventual reduction in Social Security benefits or force
a general tax increase, something the president has vowed to oppose.
   Moynihan has argued that the Social Security payroll tax should
be reduced since the growing surpluses in the Social Security tax
were not being saved to pay for the retirement of the Baby Boom
generation but were instead being used to mask the government's
real budget deficit.

   While most Beijing residents rested Saturday from
late-night celebrations of the start of the Year of the Horse, top
leaders were out hugging babies in a campaign to show Communist
Party unity with the masses.
   Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Tian Jiyun
visited homes in a rural village outside Beijing.
   Premier Li Peng went to a coking plant, a thermal electricity
plant and Tiananmen Square, the base for the pro-democracy movement
government troops crushed in June.
   President Yang Shangkun visited an exhibition hall in Shanghai,
and vice premiers Yao Yilin and Wu Xueqian went to a food market in
central Beijing.
   The national television news Saturday evening showed each of
them shaking hands, making jokes and hugging babies in a
campaign-stumping style that has become common here only in the
past few years.
   The official term for such visits to homes and factories is
``going to the grass roots,'' and it is an axiom of Maoist
Communism that ``uniting with the masses'' is the only way to stay
in power.
   The leaders' schedules were planned to include visits with
peasants, workers and soldiers, the three ``red'' _ or
revolutionary _ classes.
   In Tiananmen Square, Li saluted men of the People's Armed
Police, a paramilitary force, and praised them for serving the
country.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping was shown on television attending a
New Year's Eve party in Shanghai, but there was no report of
further activities Saturday.
   The 85-year-old Deng, who holds no official post but still holds
decisive power, walked with a slightly unsteady gait, as he has in
recent years, and shook hands with Shanghai officials with a fixed
smile on his face.
   Deng customarily spends the Lunar New Year in Shanghai.
   Officials in Beijing gathered at the Great Hall of the People
for a party, at which Li gave a speech reaffirming the government's
determination to continue its drastic austerity policy.
   Sharp reductions in credit and construction have slowed
inflation, but also have forced the closure of millions of rural
factories. Urban factories remain open, but in many the workers sit
around playing cards and drinking tea because they lack electricity
or raw materials.
   Li pledged the government's ``unremitting efforts'' to educate
Chinese in ``patriotism, collectivism, socialism, self-reliance and
hard struggle.''
   ``The year 1989 was an unusual year,'' he said. ``The Chinese
people ... withstood a severe test and achieved a great victory in
quelling the anti-government rebellion in Beijing last June.'' He
was referring to the massive pro-democracy demonstrations that were
crushed by the army, leaving hundreds and possible thousands dead.
   ``We believe that ... the progressive cause of socialism has a
bright future in spite of twists and turns along its advance,'' he
said.
   Li condemned what he called a trend in Taiwan toward seeking
independence from the mainland. The island province has been
isolated from the mainland since 1949 under rule of the rival
Nationalists, but both sides have always regarded it as part of
China.
   ``We will not sit idly by and will not keep silent if Taiwan
works for independence,'' Li warned.

   Vice President Dan Quayle said
Saturday after meeting with Latin heads of state that the U.S.
invasion of Panama has created no ``sour note'' in U.S.-Latin
relations despite their earlier comments deploring the military
action.
   Quayle said, however, that the heads of state with whom he met
did voice concerns and made it clear they want to see U.S. invasion
troops withdrawn from Panama.
   ``Yes, it will help when we're able to reduce our troops,''
Quayle told reporters after a lunch with the presidents of Costa
Rica, Venezuela, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and the prime
minister of Belize. ``That will be a positive contribution toward
the building of democracy in Panama.''
   ``Did they express concern? Certainly concern was expressed,''
Quayle acknowledged. But he and his aides reported an upbeat
atmosphere nonetheless.
   Quayle had said earlier in the day that the additional troops
would be withdrawn in ``a matter of weeks, not months.''
   A senior administration official traveling with Quayle said that
the sense was many Latin countries would not recognize the
U.S.-installed government of President Guillermo Endara in Panama
until the troop levels are down from the current 17,000 to the
pre-invasion force of some 13,000. At the invasion, there were a
total of 27,000 U.S. troops.
   However, the official insisted, there was ``no resentment''
expressed at the luncheon at the home of newly inaugurated Honduran
President Rafael Callejas.
   ``Panama was the dog that didn't bark,'' the official claimed,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Quayle was sent by President Bush to explain the invasion
rationale to the regional leaders, most of whom expressed dismay at
the invasion of Panama's sovereignty in the Dec. 20 military action.
   ``I am convinced that this decision by the president ... will
not be any type of sour note and we will be able to continue with
the good relations we have had,'' Quayle told reporters. ``There is
no strain in the relationship.''
   Quayle talked at some length privately with Callejas about
economic issues, aides said, and also for about 25 minutes with
Costa Rican President Oscar Arias about the upcoming presidential
election in neighboring Nicaragua.
   He later held a lengthy session with Venezuelan President Carlos
Andres Perez, whose government was among the most offended by the
invasion of Panama.
   A senior official traveling with Quayle subsequently
characterized Perez' position as: ``He regretted the U.S. had to
take this action, however it was done.''
   Venezuela was among the countries that signaled to Quayle that
resentment against the invasion was so intense that it would not be
opportune for him to visit there now.
   The official in the Quayle party said Perez explained that a
Quayle visit ``would be an excuse for the left to stage
anti-American demonstrations.''
   However, the official said Perez said he would welcome a visit
by Quayle soon and that ``it would be a very positive situation''
when the additional U.S. troops are out of Panama.
   ``It is necessary for the United States to withdraw its troops
from Panama as soon as possible,'' Arias said at a news conference.
``It is also necessary for the U.S. and Latin America to undertake
a joint effort as soon as possible to help in the total
reconstruction of Panama.''
   The leaders were in Honduras for the inauguration of Callejas.
   Quayle, speaking briefly to reporters after the breakfast at the
home of Ambassador Chris Arcos, acknowledged the Panama invasion
was ``not without controversy.
   ``We have certainly read the public pronouncements. Today and
tomorrow and Monday my mission will be private consultations, not
in the nature of apologizing, but in the nature of where do we go
from here. How can we work together to build democracy.''
   As to the 17,000 troops remaining in Panama, down from about
27,000 at the height of the invasion, Quayle said he would tell the
Latin leaders Bush is committed to reducing the level to the 13,000
pre-invasion strength.
   He would not give a timetable but said it was ``a time period of
weeks rather than months. We are moving in a downward direction.''
   Before the inauguration, Quayle met with El Salvador's President
Alfredo Cristiani in a session that focused mostly on human rights
and the need to move expeditiously to prosecute military officers
charged in the Nov. 16 slaying of six Salvadoran Jesuit priests.
   Quayle was applauded and cheered where he entered the outdoor
stadium where the inaugural ceremony was held. He later commented
``I was impressed by the enthusiastic response President Callejas
got'' during his lengthy inaugural speech.
   Following the ceremony, Quayle met with the presidents of
Venezuela, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Belize, in addition to
Callejas.
   They attended a luncheon hosted by Callejas that included a
minister of Nicaragua, Miguel d'Escoto. Nicaragua's president,
Daniel Ortega, did not attend the inauguration of his neighbor.
   As Quayle arrived at Callejas' home he told a handful of
onlookers that it was ``a great day for democracy.''
   At lunch Quayle planned to discuss Bush's rationale for the
Panama invasion, his aides said.
   Quayle and his party, which included Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.,
and Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., strongly urged
Cristiani to keep pressing on that case, said one official in the
Quayle party.
   They impressed on him the high level of interest in Congress,
where the Jesuits case revived rumblings about cutting the $1.5
million-per-day U.S. aid to El Salvador.
   Talking briefly with reporters, Quayle said Cristiani had
assured him of his ``steadfast conviction'' to seeing justice in
the case. He praised Cristiani for ``doing the right thing'' in
arresting four officers and four soldiers in the killings.
   Cristiani assured Quayle and his party ``that he will pursue
this investigation to its conclusion,'' the vice president said.
   Cristiani said ``we are very well on our way'' in the
investigation.
   Testimony by the soldiers has pointed to Col. Guillermo Alfredo
Benavides, who is charged in killings, as the one who gave the
orders.
   If they come to trial it will be the first trial of officers in
connection with a human rights case in El Salvador.
   Quayle aides said the vice president also was prepared to
discuss concerns by the small countries of the region who stand to
see their U.S. aid packages cut, even as Bush puts forward a $1
billion plan to help Panama recover from the invasion.
   In Honduras, the United States withheld some $70 million in 1989
aid because outgoing President Jose Azcona did not implement
promised economic reforms.
   Callejas, leader of the National Party, succeeds Azcona after
winning the election last November. It was the second time Callejas
was the top vote getter in a presidential contest. The other was in
1985 when he was prevented from victory by election rules that
allowed Azcona to take office.
   Callejas has promised to implement economic reforms that the
United States has been pushing.
   Also of concern to the Bush administration is how the new
government will deal with the Nicaraguan Contra rebels encamped
along the Honduran border. Azcona periodically has demanded the
U.S.-backed rebels be removed from Honduran territory. But U.S.
officials have urged Honduras not to boot them out.
   Traveling with Quayle for all or part of his three-day trip to
Panama Saturday night and Jamaica on Monday are Lugar, Montgomery,
Republican political consultant Mitch Daniels, Assistant Secretary
of State Bernard Aronson, as well as Quayle's staff.

   For six months, Jeff Yoder and Deborah
Werksman have been hunting Quayle in the newspapers and are
displaying their catch in a new publication devoted exclusively to
the vice president.
   The Quayle Quarterly went out in the mail last week to its first
500 subscribers, offering a generous mix of satirical and serious
news about the man who's a heartbeat away from the presidency.
   Articles include ``The Quayle Trail,'' a sampling of Quayle's
verbal gaffes, ``Travel Tips for Number Twos,'' and ``Here, But
Still Forgotten,'' along with a quiz, cartoons and letters.
   There's an advertisement for a Dan Quayle doormat and a list of
Quayle statistics, like the number of House Small Business
Committee meetings he missed in one session (10 of 14).
   Subscriptions have been sold so far to citizens, political
consultants and the Democratic National Committee. No senators and
congressmen have signed on, ``but I think a lot of their aides
did,'' said Werksman, 31.
   She runs the desk-top operation with her husband from his
Bridgeport home. They have a commuter marriage and Werksman lives
in New York City. Both are registered Democrats and did not vote
for Quayle and his running mate.
   That Quayle is vice president ``means he's grooming for the
presidency. He's being groomed and the American public is being
groomed to accept him,'' Werksman said.
   ``Americans have a short memory and we would just like to keep
the focus. We don't want it to just happen and everybody turn
around and say, `How did this happen?''' she said.
   Yoder, 35, got the idea for the Quayle Quarterly while driving
to his job at a Stamford computer software firm.
   ``He heard on the radio _ this was back in September _ that
William Bennett was being named drug czar, and it registered in his
mind that that was a job Bush mentioned as Quayle's job all through
the election,'' Werksman said.
   ``He wondered, well, what is Quayle's job? And he thought others
were probably wondering as well,'' she said.
   Werksman and Yoder figure they'll have to sell 2,000
subscriptions to break even. Four issues cost $12.
   Is Quayle a subscriber?
   ``We sent him a complimentary copy of the first issue. We only
sent it yesterday _ bulk mail,'' Werksman said with a laugh on
Tuesday. ``In fact, we debated whether we should make him buy it.''
   Quayle's spokesman, Dave Beckwith, said he has yet to see a
copy, but knew it was coming because his office answered questions
from the publishers.
   ``I'm not exactly sure who they are, but we tried to answer
their questions as well as we could,'' he said. ``It seems to be a
mixture of fun _ which I have no objection to, as long as they're
fair about it _ and serious, scholarly work.''

<TEXT>
   The same day gubernatorial candidate John Silber
found himself defending remarks viewed as racist, he caused further
controversy with his comments on alcohol abuse.
   ``You can live with alcohol abuse and still achieve at a high
level,'' said Silber, speaking to a group of Milton High School
teachers Friday.
   Silber, who is on leave as president of Boston University,
described a former boss who drank a ``pint of whiskey or enough
until he put himself to sleep'' every night but awoke to function
fully.
   Several teachers criticized his remarks, which came in response
to a question about what the faculty should do about increased
drinking by students.
   Silber said alcoholics do not burden society in the same way as
drug addicts and should not be lumped together with them.
   ``He is downplaying the ramifications of alcoholism,'' said Mary
Cobb, president of the teacher's union. ``The horror and
destruction alcoholism causes may not be as flashy, but they can be
just as devastating as drug abuse.''
   Michal Regunberg, a Silber spokeswoman, said Saturday the
Democratic candidate's remarks were not controversial and stressed
that he did not discount the dangers posed by those who drive after
drinking alcohol.
   ``I think what he was saying is that in comparison with the
scourge of drugs ... you can't compare the two. Alcohol, whether we
like it or not, has been a part of society for a long time,'' she
said.
   Silber's remarks Friday came during a day when he had to defend
himself in the face of charges that he had made racist remarks
about welfare in Massachusetts. In a published interview he had
questioned whether the state has become a ``welfare magnet.''
   ``I think anyone who raised the suggestion that I was either
hostile to immigrants or in any sense a racist definitely owes me
an apology,'' Silber said Friday, adding that his father was a
German immigrant.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who is not seeking re-election, called
Silber's comments about immigrants to the state offensive and
pressed him to apologize.

   Communist leaders wrote off their fading
party on Saturday and began issuing cards for a new party, one they
hope stands a better chance of winning power in an increasingly
democratic Poland.
   They met for the final congress of the Polish United Workers
Party _ the communist party's formal name _ as riot police clashed
outside with hundreds of demonstrators still outraged by the
Communists' long hold on Poland.
   No arrests or serious injuries were reported.
   At least one major reformer, Tadeusz Fiszbach, did not sign up
to join the new party, which had yet to be named. A party spokesman
said there were no figures on how many delegates did.
   The three-day congress was convened to officially dissolve the
Polish United Workers Party, as the Communist Party is formally
known. Delegates also planned to condemn Communist ideology,
endorse parliamentary democracy and start a new left-wing party
with a different name.

   Two construction workers plunged to their deaths
Saturday when a ladder they were using on a 14th floor terrace
toppled over, police said.
   Police Sgt. Norris Hollomon identified the victims as Benjamin
Perez, 22, and Manuel Suberdo, 31, both of New York.
   According to police and witnesses, the workers were doing brick
and stone restoration work on the 14-story midtown apartment
building when the ladder Perez was standing on twisted and fell.
   Suberdo tried to right the ladder but lost his footing and fell
with his co-worker to the sidewalk, said Sgt. Ed Burns, a police
spokesman.
   The contractor, Key Restoration, was issued a summons by the
city Department of Buildings for working on Saturday without
permits, said Hollomon.

<HEAD>U.S. Field Biologist Sees `Total Destruction' of Amazon Rain
Forest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.S. field biologist and
conservation activist said Saturday he foresees total destruction
of the Amazon jungle, home to thousands of species of plants and
animals and a major source of Earth's oxygen.
   Archie Carr blamed the Brazilian government, saying it
complained about efforts to protect its rain forest instead of
cooperating to save the jungle, the world's largest wilderness.
   He spoke to The Associated Press at a congress on conservation
at this field research station 70 miles west of Caracas, the
capital.
   U.S. and Latin American field biologists and educators have
gathered in the rain forest to discuss ways to instill a
conservation ethic in young people.
   Most U.S. participants said they were surprised at how much
conservation was taught in a school they visited in the Catia slums
of west Caracas and how much grass-roots support for conservation
exists in the region.
   ``Many of us were not even aware of our own prejudices,'' said
Ann Berkovits, director of teaching programs at the Bronx Zoo in
New York City.
   The First Pan-American Congress on Conservation of Wildlife
through Education is sponsored by the New York Zoological Society
through its field research wing, Wildlife Conservation
International.
   Carr is regional coordinator of the society's field programs in
Mexico and the Caribbean.
   Brazilians say their struggling economy benefits from
development work in the Amazon.
   President Fernando Collor de Mello told a news conference Friday
in Washington, where he was visiting President Bush, that his
government is aware of environmental concerns. But, he said, any
actions Brazil decides to take will be because the government
believes it is in the best interests of Brazil, not because of
outside pressure.
   Carr said in the interview, ``At the present time, I see no
reason not to foresee an Amazon Basin that is totally deforested,
populated from end to end, and the scene of a whole host of
environmental problems that would constitute a planetary disaster
of historical dimensions.''
   He said Brazil's recent efforts to overturn legislation giving
tax breaks to settlers clearing the land were not enough to save
the immense region, almost as large as the continental U.S.
   ``The only thing that's saving the Amazon at present is its
magnitude,'' he said.
   Carr said Brazil in the mid-1970s instituted a tax program to
encourage slum dwellers in major cities to emigrate to the scarcely
populated northern and western Amazonian states, but that the soil
there is not able to support agriculture and settlers were left
worse off than before.
   ``That's what galls conservationists. If we're going to help
poor people, let's help poor people, not try to solve a momentary
crisis by invading nature,'' he said.
   ``I just won't accept that saving the Amazon Basin is an
imperialistic solution. The urge to conserve the environment is a
universal need and it is growing,'' Carr said.
   He was answering criticism that industrialized nations are
hypocritical in urging the Amazon nations of Brazil, Venezuela,
Ecuador, Colombia and Peru to conserve the jungle instead of
cleaning up their own backyards.
   The five countries recently formed an Amazonian nation pact to
study the little-known region and come up with solutions to save
its resources.
   But Carr warned that because of a delicate environmental balance
in the Amazon, tampering with the region could lead to severe
flooding and droughts that would change the entire planet's weather
patterns.
   He said creating a national park would not solve the problems
facing the Amazon Basin, because of the sheer vastness of the
region.
   Scientists say destruction of the rain forest adds to the
greenhouse effect, which traps the sun's rays and causes global
warming.
   The Brazilian government says only 5 percent of its rain forest
has been destroyed. The World Bank, however, says 12 percent has
been cut and burned.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quaker Oats Co. is using full-page newspaper ads
to sprinkle some salt on the credibility of a recent medical study
that found oat bran supplies no special cholesterol-lowering effect.
   The cereal manufacturer has bought full-page ads in seven major
newspapers nationwide to cite 10 previous studies supporting its
claim that eating oat bran helps reduce blood-cholesterol levels
and the risk of heart attack.
   The plain black-and-white ads, published Friday in some papers,
list the studies individually by author, title, publication and
date.
   ``Quaker Oat Bran can help reduce cholesterol. Look at 27 years
of research,'' say the ads, which ask consumers who want details on
the research to write to the Chicago-based company.
   The ads were bought in USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, The
New York Times, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, the Chicago
Tribune and the Los Angeles Times.
   Quaker holds about 70 percent of the oat bran cereal market. Its
sales of Oat Bran Original Hot Cereal went from 1 million pounds in
all of 1987 to 2 million pounds per month in 1989.
   In all, 218 new oat bran products were introduced last year
alone, according to Gorman's New Product News, an industry
newsletter.
   But some analysts predict the oat-bran boom will go bust, or at
least be deflated, because of a Harvard study published last week
saying oat bran has no special cholesterol-lowering properties.
   The study, which appeared in the New England Journal of
Medicine, said the apparent cholesterol-reducing benefits of eating
oat bran resulted from its replacement of fatty foods in people's
diets, not from a special property of the grain itself.
   Other cereals work just as well to reduce artery-clogging excess
cholesterol in the bloodstream, said the authors.
   Kellogg Co., another major cereal manufacturer that makes oat
products such as Common Sense Oat Bran cereal, has ``no plans to
change our marketing strategy and no plans to change our
advertising,'' spokeswoman Nancy Roach said from the company's
headquarters in Battle Creek, Mich.
   Quaker spokesman Ron Bottrell said his company has no plans to
run additional ads or to change its marketing or advertising for
Quaker Oat Bran hot cereal, Oat Bran cold cereal or oatmeal
products.
   The company has research findings indicating the Harvard study
hasn't swayed people away from using oat bran, ``but we wanted to
reinforce with those customers (the fact that) a large body of
research existed,'' Bottrell said.
   Bonnie Liebman, director of nutrition for the Washington-based
consumer group Center for Science in the Public Interest, agreed.
   ``Scientists are used to having studies with opposite results
and they know that, over time, the truth emerges,'' Ms. Liebman
said. ``Consumers have only recently accepted science and health as
news, and they aren't used to that.''

   A 19th-century weather vane was sold for

   The copper and zinc weather vane, which portrays a well-dressed
rider on a horse, was purchased by Stephen Score, an Essex, Mass.,
dealer, said Matthew Weigman, a spokesman for the auction house.
   It was the top lot in the sale of the collection of Bernard M.
Barenholtz, who co-founded the toy manufacturer Creative Playthings
and was a widely repected collector and author. Barenholtz died
last August.
   The collection brought a total of $2.6 million at the auction, a

   Barenholtz acquired the weather vane, made about 1860, in 1966.
The 42-inch high piece, created by J. Howard &amp; Co. of West

19th-century pine spinning toy carved into a sailor, which brought
$38,500; a 19th-century rocking horse that sold for $17,600; and an
1824 New England tavern sign that sold for $71,500, Weigman said.

   Blair Bolles, a former journalist who
worked for The Washington Star and The Blade of Toledo and wrote a
book about the reconstruction of Europe after World War II, has
died at age 78.
   A cause of death was not immediately available. He died Friday.
   Bolles attended Yale University and in 1935 began covering the
White House and State Department for the now-defunct Washington
Star.
   He also wrote for a number of publications, including The
Nation, Business Week, The New Republic, the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, Click magazine, and the King Features Syndicate.
   His book, ``The Big Change,'' was based on his reporting for the
Blade from 1953 to 1956 and argued that Europe's old class
structure would give way to a more consumer-oriented, Americanized
society.
   Bolles wrote three other books: ``Tyrant from Illinois,'' ``How
to Get Rich in Washington,'' and ``Men of Good Intentions.'' In
addition, he co-authored ``America's Chance of Peace'' and a number
of foreign-policy booklets.
   He began working for The Blade in 1948 on a free-lance basis,
providing foreign affairs analysis. In 1953, Bolles opened the
newspaper's Paris bureau.
   He returned to Toledo in 1956 and worked as an associate editor
at the Blade until 1959, when he left Toledo and began a business
career with Fairbanks Whitney, later known as Colt Industries. He
worked in the company's government affairs office in Washington and
retired in 1976.
   Bolles is survived by his sons, Harry, DeVallon, and Blair, Jr.;
a daughter, Zoe, six grandchildren, and a foster grandchild.

   The communist party's plan to dissolve
itself and form a single new party with broader appeal was
threatened Saturday when a group of renegade members accused the
leadership of making only cosmetic changes.
   The communist party opened its final congress Saturday to form a
new party that it hopes will stand a better chance of winning power
in an increasingly democratic Poland.
   After heated debate most delegates voted to suspend the congress
of the Polish United Workers Party _ the party's formal name _ and
immediately open the founding congress of the new, still-unnamed
party.
   But a leading progressive, Tadeusz Fiszbach, and about 100
others refused to join, saying no authentic reform had emerged and
that the new party must shed part of its old conservative
membership to draw support.
   ``It's not our goal to break up the party, but we all are not
going the same way,'' Fiszbach told about 200 delegates at a
meeting early Sunday after the congress recessed for the night.
   Fiszbach, a communist parliamentary leader with backing from
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, was enlisting supporters for another
new party _ to be called the Social Democratic Union of the
Republic of Poland.
   Communist leaders sought to negotiate with Fiszbach in hopes of
avoiding a split.
   First Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski opened the three-day
communist party congress with a surprise announcement that he would
not try to lead a new party.
   During the afternoon, riot police clashed with hundreds of
anti-communist demonstrators Saturday outside Congress Hall. No
arrests or serious injuries were reported.
   The agenda of the communist party congress called for dissolving
the 41-year-old party with a resounding condemnation of its
ideology and endorsement of parliamentary democracy, the starting
work on the new party.
   But the more than 1,600 delegates voted overwhelmingly to change
the order by proceeding with forming the new party before
dissolving the old one.
   Fear about what would happen to the party's assets was a focal
point of much of the debate over issues involved in the dissolution.
   The legal status of buildings, companies, car fleets and other
property amassed by the communist party during its long control is
under review by a commission established last week. The
Solidarity-led government is trying to defuse public clamor to
nationalize the communists' holdings.
   After the vote suspending the communist party congress,
delegates began signing cards making them founding members of the
new, still unnamed party, which is likely to follow the Social
Democratic model.
   The delegates then quickly approved a 44-member presidium for
the new party and bylaws that had been prepared in advance.
   But Fiszbach's absence became public when his seat on a
committee had to be reassigned.
   He wanted immediate dissolution of the communist party and his
backers said unless there was evidence of deep reform, people would
not believe a truly new party had been formed.
   ``I haven't seen manipulation of such a kind for a very, very
long time,'' said communist parliament Deputy Wlodzimierz
Cimoszewicz.
   ``Mr. Rakowski should get a prize as the best magician of the
year. In one speech he turned ... communists into Social Democrats.
Everything going on in that room is too good to be true.''
   Rakowski and other leaders hope the new party will become the
main left-wing party in Poland's widening democratic political
spectrum.
   The communist party ceded governing power to the Solidarity
movement after disastrous defeat last year in the freest elections
here since World War II.
   Poland since has plunged into economic reforms aimed at swiftly
converting the system to free enterprise.
   The nation's communist party would become the second in the East
bloc to reconstitute itself. The Hungarian Socialist Workers Party
transformed itself into the Hungarian Socialist Party in October.
   As delegates met, more than 500 demonstrators from
anti-Communist groups gathered outside chanting, ``Communists must
go!'' They burned a red flag.
   Riot police moved in to push them away, with a few police using
truncheons. One demonstrator was seen with a bloodied face.
   The police moved the protesters a block away, where
demonstrators continued to hurl stones, bottles, firecrackers and a
few gasoline bombs.
   The delegates gathered in Warsaw's imposing Stalinist-era Palace
of Culture and Science, where Rakowski opened the meeting with a
speech reviewing the party's past and discussing the future.
   In announcing he would not seek a leadership role in a new
party, Rakowski, 65, said: ``I consider it appropriate to pass over
the helm to a new generation.'' The delegates responded with a
standing ovation.
   Rakowski appealed to the delegates _ whose opinions range from
orthodox communism to extreme liberalism _ not to split into more
than one party.
   ``If we want to exist as a real force in the Polish political
scene, we should not leave the Congress Hall through different
exits,'' he said.
   Rakowski said he had struggled to reform the party since the
Stalinist era ended in 1956 but failed because many members clung
to Stalinist ideas and the Soviet Union continued to interfere with
Polish reforms until the rise of Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1985.
   Referring to the past, he said: ``It's true that we deserved a
good whipping.''
   The party now claims 1.9 million members, but the one that
emerges after the congress will be much smaller, Politburo member
Janusz Reykowski predicted in an interview.
   Walesa and the communist party's delegation in Parliament have
supported Fiszbach to lead the new party. Fiszbach is a former
Gdansk party chief ousted from official positions in the 1980s
because he opposed the 1981 imposition of martial law.
   Possible candidates include Aleksander Kwasniewski, 35, now in
charge of national sports and recreation, or Leszek Miller, 43, a
party secretary and Rakowski loyalist.
   Another potential candidate, Slawomir Wiatr, 37, founder of a
liberal party faction, on Saturday announced his support for
Kwasniewski to be leader.
   The communist party was founded in 1948 in a merger forced by
Soviet dictator Josef Stalin of the small Communist Polish Workers
Party and the Polish Socialist Party, a left-wing party dating from
the 19th century that enjoyed broad popular support.
   Now the party says it wants to give up the Communist part of
that heritage and become a Social Democratic group building on the
old socialist tradition.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti's Roman Catholic bishops
Saturday urged the military government to stop its crackdown on the
opposition and restore individual liberties suspended after a state
of siege was declared last week.
   ``It is time for us to stop tearing each other apart,'' said a
statement read by the church's Radio Soleil and signed by Haiti's
10 bishops.
   On Saturday, two journalists and five other people were reported
arrested in the northern port city of Cap-Haitien. Several homes
and businesses were searched for weapons in Port-au-Prince and
Cap-Haitien, witnesses said.
   Six of the seven were released after being held briefly. The one
still detained was not a journalist.
   The bishops asked the government to allow the return of seven
political, civic and business leaders who were forced into exile
after government leader Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril declared the 30-day
state of siege on Jan. 20.
   They also urged the government to ``abolish torture in all its
forms.''
   Since Jan. 20, police have arrested more than 50 political
activists. Most were reportedly released but complained they were
beaten while in custody.
   In Cap-Haitien, police arrested Hugues Florvil and Bell Angelo,
both journalists of privately owned Radio Cap-Haitien, said a
Cap-Haitien source who insisted on anonymity.
   The two were later released.
   The government imposed censorship on radio stations Tuesday,
barring them from broadcasting news not approved by authorities.
Since then no radio stations, the main source of news in Haiti,
have broadcast local news.
   Cap-Haitien police also arrested and released activist and
shopkeeper Edouard Laroche and Max Vieux, the 85-year-old
father-in-law of conservative opposition leader Gerard
Philippe-Auguste, who has been in hiding since last week, the
source said.
   The bishops urged the government to ``take concrete steps to
establish a favorable climate for free and honest elections.''
   The crackdown came a day after mystery gunmen killed army Col.
Andre Neptune. Critics accused Avril of using the killing as a
pretext to repress the opposition and renege on his promise of free
elections in October.
   Avril said on state television Friday night he will lift the
state of siege Tuesday and reaffirmed his commitment to elections,
but ``in a more serene climate.'' He did not say if exiled leaders
could return.
   France, the United States, Canada and the European Community
have condemned the repression and banishments.
   France, Haiti's largest donor and former colonial ruler,
suspended economic aid and talks on a $500 million development
package.

<HEAD>Report Says Western Hostages Are Alive In Beirut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sunday Correspondent newspaper, quoting
unidentified senior, pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem sources, reported
Sunday that Western hostages held in Lebanon are alive.
   The report said sources in Hezbollah, a Shiite fundamentalist
faction, had confirmed that the hostages, numbering 17 according to
the newspaper's information, are ``fit and well.''
   The newspaper reported the hostages are kept in small groups and
moved regularly from one safe house to another in west Beirut's
suburbs.
   The front-page story quoted a conversation heard by London-based
reporter Hala Jaber at a wake she attended recently in Beirut of a
Hezbollah member killed in south Lebanon.
   The Lebanese-born journalist said she heard a well-known
Hezbollah member tell her unidentified contact he had guarded
hostages John McCarthy and Thomas Sutherland in the basement of a
house in the southern suburbs of west Beirut.
   The paper quoted the Hezbollah member as saying the guards had
instructions to keep the hostages healthy.
   Most Western hostages in Lebanon are believed to be held by
factions of Hezbollah, or Party of God, that receives considerable
financial support from Iran.
   Hezbollah works closely with units of the Iranian Revolutionary
Guards, stationed in Lebanon since Israel's 1982 invasion, to build
influence among the country's 1.2 million Shiites, Lebanon's
largest sect.
   The longest held hostage is Terry Anderson, 42, chief Middle
East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped on
March 16, 1985.
   McCarthy, 33, a British television journalist, was kidnapped
April 17, 1986 as he drove to Beirut airport to flee the country.
   Scottish-born U.S. citizen, Sutherland, 57, the acting dean of
agriculture at the American University in Beirut, was abducted June
9, 1985.
   ``This was not the usual Beirut talk, rumor mingled with
speculation masquerading as fact,'' Ms. Jaber wrote about the
conversation at the wake.
   ``These were two friends, talking privately after a funeral in
the heartland of Hezbollah. Nor did it seem likely that Hezbollah
was deliberately leaking information; they could do that far more
effectively by sending a photograph or a videotape of the hostages
to a Western news agency or a local newspaper.'' .
   The Sunday Correspondent said the conversation was confirmed by
a senior, unidentified member of Hezbollah's security network, who
said McCarthy and Sutherland were held together.
   ``They are in the same cell. All the other hostages are alive
and well,'' the newspaper quoted the source as saying. ``They are
not held in the same place for security reasons. They have been
split into small groups in various parts of the suburbs.''
   Jill Morrell, the TV journalist who has campaigned for
McCarthy's release, said the report matched information she had
received from French hostage Paul Kauffmann, released in spring
1988, The Sunday Correspondent reported.
   ``It is the most encouraging news we have had for a long time.
There have been so many stories, but this one sounds as if makes
sense,'' The Sunday Correspondent quoted Miss Morrell as saying.
   The newspaper quoted British government sources as saying the
report was ``interesting and possible.''
   The Foreign Office had no comment.
   In its total of 17 Western hostages, the Sunday Correspondent
did not include Alec Collett, 67, a British, New York-based writer
who was on assignment for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency when he
was kidnapped on March 25, 1985.
   The Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Moslems said it
kidnapped and killed Collett. A video was released purporting to
show his body hanging from a scaffold. No body was found.

   U.S. drug agents Saturday seized 2,700 acres
in Pennsylvania linked to the Colombian Medellin cartel, in what
was called the largest amount of land ever seized by the government
in a forfeiture action.
   The $2.8 million property, which belonged to a convicted cocaine
smuggler, is a heavily-wooded area in northeastern Pennsylvania
that includes several lakes, the Drug Enforcement Administration
said.
   The land was owned by Frederick Luytjes, through his Mastwood
Corp. of Dalton, Pa. The DEA asserts he purchased the land with
profits from 10 tons of Colombian cocaine imported from 1981 to
1984.
   The money was used to pay off a $1 million mortgage on the
property in 1986, the DEA said.
   Luytjes, 42, is serving a 10-year sentence in federal prison. As
owner and operator of Air America Inc., a carrier service based at
Wilkes-Barre-Scranton International Airport, he provided aircrafts
and recruited pilots for a major cocaine smuggling operation,
federal authorities said.
   Luytjes was an unindicted co-conspirator in an indictment
returned in August 1986 against 12 people accused of smuggling
cocaine into the country. Among them were brothers Arturo
Correa-Arroyave and Rigoberto Correa-Arroyave, members of a
principal Columbian drug trafficking family and prominent figures
in the Medellin cartel, authorities said.
   Luytjes pleaded guilty in August 1986 to charges of conspiracy
to import cocaine, possession with intent to distribute and
distribution of cocaine and income tax violations.
   The seized property, which U.S. marshals said was the largest
amount of land ever seized by the government in a forfeiture
action, will be handed over to the government if it can prove in
court that the property was purchased with the proceeds of illegal
drug sales.

   U.S. Ambassador Robert Pelletreau and a
senior aide to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat have held another meeting
aimed at opening an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue, the official
Palestinian news agency WAFA reported Saturday.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III has proposed such
talks in Cairo as a prelude to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's plan to hold elections among Palestinians in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   WAFA gave no details of the Friday meeting except to say
Pelletreau met with Hakim Balawi of the Palestine Liberation
Organization to discuss ``the means and possibilities of opening an
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.''
   Pelletreau has been the sole American official authorized to
meet with the PLO since the United States recognized the
organization in December 1988.
   The Baker plan to advance the elections has stalled on Israel's
refusal to negotiate with the PLO, which it regards as a terrorist
group, and PLO insistence on having a hand in choosing the
Palestinian delegation.
   U.S. Embassy officials could not be reached immediately for
comment, nor could officials in Washington.

   The Coast Guard on Saturday extinguished
a raging gasoline fire on a Mississippi River barge that had burned
for more than a day after colliding with another barge.
   The barges, pulled by two towboats, were traveling in opposite
directions when they collided Friday afternoon, 25 miles north of
Rosedale. One boat was towing 25 grain barges, the other was towing
five barges each carrying a total of about 20,000 barrels of
gasoline in 10 tanks.
   No one was injured in the accident.
   ``The fire was put out at 6:53 p.m.'' by chemical foam, Petty
Officer Jay Menze said Saturday night from the Coast Guard's
Memphis, Tenn., headquarters. ``They're taking off the fuel that's
on it at this time.''
   The barge on fire had been tied to a rock dike in the middle of
the river about 12 miles south of the collision so it wouldn't
threaten buildings on shore or other river vessels.
   ``We don't know how much gasoline was spilled, but we know it's
been a relatively small amount so far based on our visual
observations of the damage and based on the fact that the barge is
riding pretty level,'' said Coast Guard Cmdr. Mike Donohoe of
Memphis, Tenn.
   He said no major damage to fish and other river life was
expected.

<TEXT>
   ``Chameleon Street,'' a whimsical drama
based on the true story of an expert con man, captured the Grand
Jury Prize at the Sundance United States Film Festival on Saturday
night.
   The award, considered the most prestigious in American
independent cinema, was given to Wendell B. Harris, who wrote,
directed and starred in ``Chameleon Street.'' The fictional film is
based on the life of William Douglas Stret, a Detroit impersonator
with few equals.
   The prize, which includes $5,000, should give ``Chameleon
Street'' the acclaim needed to secure a distributor so the film can
be seen in U.S. theaters.
   The $2 million movie, typifying the renegade spirit of the
festival, was produced by Harris' mother, Helen, and was the result
of a four-year fund-raising campaign.
   Because the festival's five jurors also wanted to recognize ``To
Sleep With Anger,'' they gave the drama about family conflict a
Special Jury Prize.
   ``House Party,'' a story about teenagers and their blow-out
fete, was awarded the Filmmakers Trophy, which is chosen by
directors of the 15 dramas in competition. The Award for Excellence
in Cinematography for ``House Party'' went to Peter Deming.
   ``House Party,'' ``To Sleep With Anger'' and ``Chameleon
Street'' are all works of black filmmakers, and their triumphs
underscore the strength of contemporary black cinema.
   ``Longtime Companion,'' a drama focusing on AIDS, was awarded
the Audience Award, based on exit polling at festival screenings.
Among the well-received films that did not win awards were
``Metropolitan'' and ``The Unbelievable Truth.''
   ``True Love'' collected the top drama prize in last year's
festival, with ``sex, lies and videotape'' taking the audience
award.
   In the documentary competition with 16 entries, the top prize
and $5,000 was shared by ``Water and Power'' and ``H-2 Worker.''
The former film is about Southern California's relationship with
water; the latter looks at Caribbean laborers harvesting Florida
sugar cane.
   The documentary Audience Award went to ``Berkeley in the
Sixties.'' The Filmmakers Trophy was awarded to ``Metamorphosis:
Man Into Woman.'' ``H-2 Worker'' was presented with the
cinematography prize.
   Special jury recognition went to the documentary short
``Samsara: Death and Rebirth in Cambodia.''

   Hotel workers struck Binion's Horseshoe Club on
Saturday, with hundreds of angry pickets chanting slogans and
taunting tourists who entered the hotel and casino.
   ``Come on out, losers,'' one picket yelled at tourists entering
the casino. ``Shame on you, you slimy scabs. We don't need you
here.''
   About 300 pickets fanned out at entrances to the hotel-casino,
which covers a square block in the heart of the city's downtown
Glitter Gulch. The casino is the first to be struck since union
contracts expired June 1.
   Later Saturday, organizers said about 2,000 people showed up at
a rally in front of the hotel; police put the crowd estimate at 500.
   Dozens of police were stationed throughout the area and security
guards blocked each entrance of the casino, allowing gamblers in
and keeping strikers out. There were no arrests.
   About 1,000 kitchen workers, bartenders, porters and other
workers were expected to join in the strike at the Horseshoe, which
has long been one of the desert resort city's most popular downtown
hotel-casinos.
   The strike is the first by the 28,000-member Culinary Union
since 1984, when its citywide walkout paralyzed many major Las
Vegas resorts and cost millions of dollars in lost revenues.
   The Horseshoe is one of 14 resorts that have not reached new
pacts with the union, but 20 resorts, including most major casinos
along the Strip a couple of miles from downtown, agreed several
months ago to new five-year pacts.
   Inside, the casino was crowded with gamblers, but some tables
and gaming machines were empty. The hotel's coffee shop was closed
but a buffet remained open. Security guards kept an eye on pickets
and several police cars were stationed around the block.
   Culinary Union Local 226 secretary-treasurer Jim Arnold said 80
percent of the workers left their jobs when the strike, mainly over
wages and benefits, began at 5 a.m. Saturday.
   He said the union had been trying to avoid strikes at major
resorts since the union contract expired. ``We didn't want any
problems,'' Arnold said. ``The last thing we wanted to create was
another 1984.''
   He said the strike date was moved up following Thursday's 590-70
strike authorization vote because of alleged harassment of union
workers by hotel officials.
   Horseshoe president Jack Binion, who did not return phone calls
for comment, has said he plans to replace union workers with new
employees and keep the hotel-casino operating. Most casino workers
do not belong to unions.
   Arnold said Horseshoe negotiators and the unions were far apart
in talks that ended in December, and that the hotel refused a union
request earlier in the week to resume negotiations.
   Arnold predicted the strike would cut heavily into Horseshoe
business, which he said included many local residents who would
refuse to cross the picket lines.
   He said the resort also will find it hard to hire replacement
workers at a time the Las Vegas economy is expanding and hotel
workers are at a premium.
   Many pickets would probably begin looking for other jobs while
picketing and receiving $150 a week in strike benefits, Arnold said.

<HEAD>Judge Ruling Tribal Lawsuit Can Proceed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ruled that the Navajo Tribe can
proceed with the fraud and racketeering lawsuit filed against
suspended Chairman Peter MacDonald and more than 50 others.
   Maricopa County Superior Court Judge John Foreman ruled Friday
that the lawsuit could continue despite claims by MacDonald and his
attorney son, Peter MacDonald Jr., that it should be tossed out
because it wasn't filed in Navajo courts.
   The judge also rejected a motion Friday by Peter MacDonald Jr.
that his wife, Donna, be dismissed as a defendant.
   The elder MacDonald's lawyer, Joe Keilp, argued that the tribe
has fought for its sovereign rights for years but now is risking
them by allowing its chairman to be sued in state court.
   The tribe's lawyer, Phillip Weeks, said the case was filed in a
state court because it involves both Indians and non-Indians, and
relates to acts that occurred both on and off the Navajo
Reservation.
   The lawsuit claims the Navajo Nation was defrauded by MacDonald
in a multimillion-dollar land deal and seeks to overturn the
tribe's 1987 purchase of the 491,000-acre Boquillas Ranch in
northern Arizona.
   On Thursday, Navajo District Judge Robert Yazzie granted a
prosecution request to delay a hearing set for Monday for MacDonald
Sr.
   The hearing was scheduled to determine whether there is cause to
try MacDonald on more than 100 criminal counts involving alleged
corruption in tribal government and in MacDonald's 1986 election
campaign.
   Yazzie granted the delay because prosecutors said they were
unable to get all of their subpoenas served on witnesses in time
for the hearing.

<HEAD>Strange Light Lights Up Switchboards Along East Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people in the Eastern United
States reported seeing a strange blueish-green light in the sky
Saturday night which some experts said could have been an unusually
large meteorite.
   ``We are quite confident it was not a manmade object
re-entering,'' said Maj. Dick Adam, public affairs officer for the
North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) in Colorado
Springs, Colo. ``We have no idea what it was.''
   Robert Gribble of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle,
a private group, reported receiving dozens of calls.
   ``Based on descriptions that have been given, I'd say we're
dealing with a very large solid, a very large meteor,'' said
Gribble.
   ``Descriptions run from a blue-green to a bright green coming
down in an angular descent leaving a short tail behind it,'' said
Gribble. He said everyone who had telephoned the center described
the object ``as coming down and hitting the ground in their area,
which is very common in something like is.''
   Among the people who reported seeing the object was David
Arnold, an area air traffic control supervisor at Dulles Airport,
where the sighting occurred at 7:10 p.m. EST.
   ``We don't know exactly what it was, a meteor or a satellite,''
said Arnold, who has been an air traffic controller for 25 years.
``It lasted 25 to 30 seconds and went from brilliant white to an
orange as it broke up.
   ``We've seen things like this before, but much higher. This was
quite brilliant. It appeared to have dissipated completely.''
   However, not all witnesses saw the object change color and
appear to disappear.
   A television reporter in Oak Hill, W. Va., one of the places
where there was a flurry of initial sightings was at the home of
one of the first witnesses nearly three hours after the initial
sighting and reported the light was still hovering in the sky.
   Kitty Harrison, assignment editor for WOAY-TV in Oak Hill,
W.Va., said what she saw was ``absolutely not'' a meteorite.
   ``I've seen meteorites before and this doesn't resemble the type
of meteorite I've seen,'' she told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview from the home of Elizabeth Gray and her son,
Chris, in Stanaford, West Va.
   ``What we are seeing is a very bright bluish white object that
appears to be moving downward toward the horizon in an erratic
spiraling motion,'' Harrison told the AP. ``It is very slow. You
have to keep your eye fixed to something stationary in order to see
its progress.''
   Chris Gray, 13, was carrying firewood to the house when he saw
the object.
   ``I saw the sky light up and then I didn't pay no attention to
it until my brother said he saw the same thing,'' said the
teen-ager. ``I was looking in the binoculars and I saw this
purplish football with rings around it and it was going around in
circles and stuff.
   ``I saw the sky light up for the meteorite and then about half
an hour later I saw what I'll call a UFO, and then when the
television station called me back they told me to tape it on my cam
corder and while we were taping it was changing colors and it
started separating and going back together,'' said Chris Gray.
   Among the witnesses in the Washington area was Andrew Guthrie, a
news editor at the Voice of America since 1983.
   ``It was a dramatic thing to see,'' said Guthrie. ``I almost
drove off the road.'' He said the object appeared to be
``three-or-four times treetop level'' and about the size of a
grapefruit with an ``incandescent bright light at the center like a
magnesium flare.''
   An AP reporter walking along Pennsylvania Avenue in the Foggy
Bottom section of Washington recalled thinking initially that it
was some type manmade firework similar to flares shot into the sky
on the Fourth of July because it was very bright and distinct,
appeared to be moving across the sky at about the same speed
typical of such displays, seemed to have a tail and appeared to be
low enough to have been shot from the balcony of one of the
multistory apartment buildings in the area.
   However, the light remained on a flat trajectory, moving rapidly
across the sky without fading in intensity of falling.
   The witness then surmised that it could have been a fog-shrouded
light on a fast-moving helicopter until realizing the night was
clear and that the tell-tell ``chopper'' sound of a helicopter so
near was absent.
   A photographer driving in the same area at the time reported
similar observations, but also saw the object appear to change
color and break up. ``It looked like it was really chose,'' he
said. ``It looked like it was really there.''
   Sightings were reported from an area ranging from West Virginia
and, along the Eastern Seaboard, from Virginia to New York.
   NORAD's Adam said the Air Force was getting calls from all of
those areas.
   ``We cannot correlate the sighting with any of the information
of the objects we are tracking in space,'' said Adam. ``We are
tracking approximately 6,800 objects. Our mission is to keep track
of what's in space. Whatever it was, it wasn't one of the objects
we're tracking.''

<HEAD>Court Document Suggests William Bennett Could Still Be Suspect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense attorneys for a man cleared in the
shootings of Carol and Charles Stuart have criticized a prosecutor
for fostering an impression their client is still somehow linked to
the crime.
   Suffolk County District Attorney Newman Flanagan has stated
publicly that William Bennett is no longer a suspect. But an
appellate court brief opposing the release of police videotapes of
Stuart picking Bennett out of a police lineup suggested a link
might still be under investigation, the Boston Herald reported
Saturday.
   The prosecutors' brief stated that the tapes should be impounded
because `the man reportedly identified in the lineup may yet turn
out to have some connection with the case.''
   Bennett was placed in the lineup after he was arrested on an
unrelated charge.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, any attempt to try to indict Bennett
in this case would be an attempt to cover up the blame for their
botched investigation,'' said Bennett's attorney, Robert George.
   Stuart told police that a black mugger shot him and fatally
wounded his pregant wife Oct. 23 after they left a childbirthing
class at a Boston hospital. Ten weeks after the shooting, Stuart
apparently committed suicide after one of his brothers implicated
him in the shootings.
   The Herald quoted police sources as saying that investigators
will not concede that Bennett's remarkable resemblance to the
description Stuart gave of his attacker is a coincidence.

   After eight hours and 2,500 miles, Avianca
Flight 52 fell from the sky. But not, apparently, because of wind
shear, sabotage, a collision or any other violent, exotic or
complicated peril of modern aviation.
   It may simply have run out of gas.
   Fuel exhaustion, as the experts call it, rarely causes airline
crashes. But investigators were trying to determine if that was
really what sent Flight 52 into the Long Island woods Thursday
night, killing 73 passengers and crew members and injuring the 86
others.
   Here, insofar as it can be determined, is what happened:
   Flight 52, a Boeing 707, left El Dorado International Airport in
Bogota, capital city of Colombia, at 1:30 p.m. EST. After a stop in
Medellin, capital city of the cocaine trade, the plane headed for
New York.
   The plane, according to Colombian radio reports, had been having
maintenance problems. Over the past four months it had been hauled
back into the shop for repairs 37 times.
   It also was heading into rough weather. A slow-moving front was
dumping rain all along the East Coast, grounding many planes. But
Flight 52 was already on its way, and its passengers enjoyed a meal
of chicken and rice and a film starring Sean Connery.
   The travelers included young Blanca and Pedro Beltron, who were
traveling with their newly adoptive father to a new home in
suburban New Jersey; a 30-year-old man with more than a dozen
golf-ball sized packets of cocaine hidden inside his bowels; and
Jorge Lozano, a gray-haired Bogota resident working for American
Cargill, a large grain company. He had made this flight many times
before.
   The plane was scheduled to land at Kennedy International Airport
at 8 p.m., but air traffic was backed up all along the East Coast,
and controllers forced Flight 52 to wait en route for about 75
minutes. Then, as the plane neared New York, the passengers were
told that because of congestion there would be an additional wait
before landing. At least 45 minutes before the crash, the crew told
air traffic controllers that they were low on fuel.
   As the plane circled overhead, a woman waited at the gate at
Kennedy, barely able to contain herself.
   Aleta Heidt carried two small parkas, blue and purple, for the
two orphans who had become her children. She knew Blanca, 12, and
Pedro, 10, only from pictures, but she loved them. And she was
looking forward to seeing her husband again.
   At around 9:20 p.m., in rain, fog and low clouds, the pilot
prepared to land on runaway 22 Left. Visibility was less than a
half mile.
   Suddenly the plane was dropping too fast, and at the wrong
angle. ``Pull up! Pull up!'' intoned the recorded voice of the
plane's automatic warning device. ``Glide slope! Glide slope!''
   Looking out the window, Lozano could easily recognize the
highways below. Then, with no explanation from the cockpit, the
plane rose and banked. It was 9:24.
   The pilot told the tower the 707 was low on fuel, running out of
it.
   The tower asked the pilot if he wanted to try another approach.
Yes, he said, but we're running out of fuel. The tower gave him a
flight pattern and asked if it was OK. OK, the captain responded.
   The words ``fuel emergency,'' which might have produced a
speedier landing plan, were never spoken.
   The plane swung east out over the Atlantic and then north across
Long Island, part of a great circle that would bring it back to
Kennedy. But this maneuver also consumed vast amounts of precious
fuel. At 9:32, the pilot had more bad news: two engines were out.
That was the last the tower heard from Flight 52; at 9:34, it lost
contact.
   In the cockpit, the voice recorder stopped. The plane began to
shake. The lights inside the cabin went off, as did those on the
wings. The only illumination came from emergency lights over the
doors. The passengers were frightened. Some, especially the
children, started to cry or scream.
   We're descending, realized one woman who knew the area, but
there's no airport below.
   In the affluent suburban neighborhood below, Rick Robinson, a
53-year-old sportswriter, was watching ``The Dave Thomas Comedy
Show'' on television with his 79-year-old mother.
   Dr. Bruce Rebold, a 42-year-old physician, was talking on the
telephone with a friend.
   Jeff Race, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, was
eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and watching television
in the kitchen of his family's house.
   Overhead, Lozano had realized the plane was going to crash. The
shaking was much worse, and the craft was dropping fast. Worst of
all, the engines were silent, even though the fuel gauges would
show that the plane's tanks still held 1,300 gallons.
   There had been no explanation from the crew. But Lozano thought
he knew the problem: We're out of fuel.
   He said a prayer and, lacking a pillow, laid his attache case
over his knees. Then he bent over in the crash position and waited
to die. Five seconds later, the dark, silent plane hit the tree
line.
   Robinson heard something outside _ ``a scraping noise, like a
tree falling or a snowplow dragging along the road.''
   Rebold's house shook. When the flue came crashing down the
chimney, he figured it was time to get off the phone. ``I told my
friend I had to go, that something was happening. The house was
falling apart.''
   Race saw the kitchen lights flicker, switched on his police
radio and heard a report of a crash. He ran out the door,
forgetting to trade his Docksiders for boots.
   The 707 mowed a path through the trees, some 100 feet tall,
before hitting an embankment. The right wing broke off, and the
cockpit was crushed. Everyone and everything was thrown forward;
those in front died faster and in greater numbers.
   The plane had crashed onto a steep wooded slope, a few feet from
the deck of a large, modern house. The captain was dead or dying,
as were the two other officers in the cockpit.
   Robinson got a flashlight and went out for a look. A wire burst
into flame, showing the outline of the plane. He could hear a voice
crying feebly for help.
   Inside, Lozano looked at the wreckage that surrounded him and
realized he was still alive. ``There was a lot of screaming and
groaning around me. ... I was hoping people would help this little
girl. ... She was screaming for her mother, `Please help my mother,
she's stuck under the seat!'''
   Rescue workers brought in spotlights to cut through the fog. The
scene reminded Robinson of ``The War of the Worlds.'' The Martians
had invaded.
   Lozano could see the lights, too. But it might have been 30
minutes until firemen arrived, carried him out of the plane and
rested him on the ground outside.
   ``I laid there, counting my blessings. It was a miracle.''
   Race, one of the first people to reach the plane, found ``bodies
on top of bodies on top of bodies.'' He pulled about six children
and a dozen adults from the wreckage, and then set up a triage area
as reinforcements arrived. Soon the one access road was jammed with
vehicles, including those of the merely curious; some doctors,
nurses and technicians had to walk miles to reach the injured.
   There were unforgettable images: dozens of bodies covered by
white plastic sheets lying on the well-tended lawn of tennis star
John McEnroe's parents; a priest holding an IV bag with one hand
and administering the church's last rites with the other; a woman
who had been given up for dead and covered with a sheet, stirring
back to life.
   At a hospital a dozen miles away, Mrs. Heidt clutched a silver
crucifix. Her husband, her new son, her new daughter were in
critical condition at three hospitals with a variety of broken
limbs.
   She was asked about her husband, who went alone to Colombia to
get the kids because they couldn't both afford to take the time off
from work.
   ``When he's up and healthy and I see his beautiful brown eyes,''
she said, ``then I'll feel like talking.''

   Investigators confirmed Saturday that
none of the four engines was running when Avianca Flight 52 crashed
into a hillside, killing 73 of the 149 people on board.
   The National Transportation Safety Board had reported earlier
that three of the four engines weren't running. The fourth was dug
out of the mud by workers Saturday.
   NTSB spokesman Lee Dickinson also said Saturday that the
jetliner's crew expressed concern to air traffic controllers that
the plane was low on fuel 45 to 50 minutes before it crashed, and
the Boeing 707 was kept in holding patterns for nearly 90 minutes.
   However, it was unclear whether the plane had been put into any
of three separate holding patterns before or after the crew
complained of low fuel, Dickinson said.
   The NTSB previously reported that the crew had expressed
concerns about low fuel just 30 minutes before the crash, and that
the plane had been kept in holding patterns for about 45 minutes.
The revised estimates came after investigators interviewed air
traffic controllers, Dickinson said at the news conference at a
hotel in nearby Melville.
   Earlier in the day, Dickinson spoke at a briefing at the wooded
accident site, where investigators painstakingly examined the
wreckage, focusing especially on the broken plane's fuel tanks,
lines and gauges. The
   ``We did a quick, cursory inspection and there was no power on
these engines when the accident did occur,'' he said.
   Investigators determined the engines were not rotating because
debris inside of them had not been chewed up, he said. Fan blades
in the engine did not show damage that would have indicated a
working motor, he added.
   Residents in the affluent Long Island north shore neighborhood
reported that the plane made no sound until it hit the trees
Thursday night. The crew had radioed that it was low on fuel
shortly before the crash, and there was no explosion upon impact.
   The absence of an explosion saved lives, authorities said. Most
of the 86 survivors remained hospitalized Saturday, at least 29 of
them in critical condition. One person who survived the crash died
Saturday, said Nassau County Police spokesman Peter Franzone, but
he had no details.
   The number of people aboard was revised from 161 to 159 when
discrepancies were settled among flight lists and patient counts,
Dickinson said.
   Dickinson said it is still unknown how long it was from the time
the engines lost power to impact.
   The plane had aborted its first landing at John F. Kennedy
International Airport when an automatic warning device in the
cockpit said it was dropping too fast and at the wrong angle. Among
factors under study, Dickinson said, was whether the aborted
landing affected the plane's fuel system.
   In Bogota, a veteran Avianca pilot, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that when a 707 is low on fuel, a steep climb after
an aborted landing may force the fuel away from its engines,
causing them to stall.
   Boeing spokesman Tom Cole said Saturday he did not know if that
was the case. However, he said: ``Just on the face of it you
wouldn't design an airplane like that because you have to make
go-around attempts sometimes or take other avoidance measures.''
   He said Boeing sent three investigators to the crash site,
including a fuel expert.
   The New York Times, quoting inidentified pilots, reported in
Sunday's editions that fuel gauges on 707s are often imprecise.
Unlike newer planes, the 707 has no warning lights to indicate that
the plane is running critically low on fuel. The Times said that
the first warning light seen by the flight engineer would have been
a low-oil pressure light, and by then, the engine would already
have begun to flame out.
   Cole, however, said that in his 25 years with Boeing, he had
never heard of a problem with a fuel gauge on a 707.
   Only one of the Boeing 707's seven fuel tanks was intact,
Dickinson said. Investigators will inspect the tanks to see if any
fuel remained inside, he said.
   The NTSB has said that indicators showed the plane had about
10,000 pounds of fuel, or nearly 1,500 gallons of the 23,855
gallons of fuel a 707 can carry.
   Two fuel gauges indicated there were between 2,300 and 2,400
pounds in at least two tanks, but another gauge that measures fuel
among all seven tanks showed a total of only 1,100 to 1,200 pounds
of fuel, Dickinson said. It was not clear if those were accurate
readings or whether the needles locked into that position on
impact, he said.
   ``One of the things we have not been able to do is physically
determine how much fuel was in each tank,'' he said.
   The flight from Bogota and Medellin, Colombia, was making its
second approach to land at Kennedy airport when it crashed 15 miles
away shortly before 9:45 p.m. on a rainy, foggy night.
   Because of bad-weather delays, the plane from Bogota and
Medellin, Colombia, was put into a holding pattern for 89 minutes,
two times by controllers in Norfolk, Va. _ once for 16 minutes and
a second time for 27 minutes _ and finally 46 minutes some 40 miles
south of Kennedy, Dickinson said.
   Records were being checked in Colombia to see how much fuel was
loaded in Medellin, he said.
   After aborting its first landing attempt, the crew told air
traffic controllers the plane was low on fuel. But the crew did not
declare a fuel emergency, which would have given it landing
priority, NTSB officials said Friday.
   ``I remember the plane making all kinds of noises after the
pilot tried to land at the airport and didn't make it,'' passenger
Gloria Restrepo, who suffered fractured legs, said from her
hospital bed. ``I was scared because it didn't sound good. I knew
something was wrong. Then all the lights went out.''
   The cockpit crew members _ including Capt. Laureano Caviedes,
52, a 28-year Avianca veteran _ were killed in the crash.
   An Avianca spokesman, Jaime Marriaga, said he would have no
comment on the possible cause of the crash until its investigation
was completed.
   The 23-year-old plane had been sent to the maintenance shop 37
times in the past four months, the Colombian radio network RCN
reported.

   Some thankful survivors of Avianca Flight
52 looked forward to getting out of the hospital as early as
Monday, but at least 29 remained in critical condition Saturday and
others faced a long, hard recovery.
   ``Everybody's doing a lot better. Everybody is healing nicely at
this time, doing OK,'' said spokesman Dan Rosett of North Shore
Hospital, where 20 victims of Thursday night's crash, which killed
73, were treated.
   Dr. Charles Rogers, chief of surgery at St. Francis Hospital in
Roslyn, said some of the hospital's nine flight victims would be
able to leave soon.
   ``They all still look like they were up with Mike Tyson _ black
and blue, lots of contusions and cuts. But some of them will
probably be able to go home tomorrow or Monday,'' he said.
   At least 29 people others remained in critical condition
Saturday. The medical examiner's office said 62 of the dead had
been identified.
   All the patients at St. Francis are doing well, but one patient
who suffered a compound fracture of the left leg turned out to be a
Colombian marathoner, Placido Martin; he will require additional
surgery and long rehabilitation, Rogers said.
   Eleven adults and nine children _ the largest number of Flight
52 victims in any hospital _ were at North Shore on Saturday,
Rosett said. Eight adults and one of the children remained in
critical condition; three adults and eight of the children were
upgraded to stable condition.
   Among those at North Shore was Ivan Gomez, 32, who was holding
on to his 18-month-old daughter when the plane went down. Both of
them, along with his wife and two other children, survived the
crash.
   ``I had the baby in my arms. Then it just went down, kind of
slow,'' Gomez told his brother, Rafael. ``I remember when we hit.
That's it.''
   Carlos Gomez, whose nose was broken, was one of two survivors
hospitalized at Syosset Community Hospital.
   ``If I had any doubt about God before, this makes me believe in
him,'' said Gomez. ``I think it's a miracle.''
   Gomez said the last thing he remembered was a man emerging from
the cockpit.
   ``He had a terrible look on his face,'' Gomez said. ``I said,
`Oh my God, this is the end.' Things were all over me. I was stuck
in the chair. I was thinking about my family and I was wondering
was I alive or dead.''
   At the Nassau County Medical Center, 13 patients remained in
critical condition, said spokesman Ed Smith.
   ``Some of our patients are now in stable condition, which is at
least a slight improvement,'' he said.
   At the Stony Brook Medical Center, two of the four victims were
upgraded from critical condition _ one to stable and the other to
satisfactory, said spokesman Dominic Candido. Three of the eight
patients at Glen Cove Hospital remained critical; the rest were
either stable or satisfactory, said vice president for public
affairs Steve Bernstein.
   Other patients were being treated at Central General Hospital,
Huntington Hospital, Long Island Jewish Hospital and Winthrop
University Hospital.

   The crew of a Colombian jetliner was
worried about running low on fuel just before the plane crashed,
killing 72 people, federal investigators say.
   National Safety Board member Lee Dickinson told a news
conference Friday that the crew, on a voice recorder recovered from
the wreckage, expressed concern several times about fuel levels
after an aborted landing attempt.
   But the pilot did not declare an emergency landing priority that
would have required controllers to immediately clear Avianca
Airlines Flight 52 for a landing Thursday night, he said.
   Although many clues indicate the plane had little or no fuel
when it crashed into a hill on the north shore of Long Island,
federal investigators would not say that the crash was caused by
the plane running out of fuel.

   Manuel Noriega must remain in jail despite his
claim that he is a prisoner of war and should be moved to a neutral
country, a judge ruled.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler's decision on Friday came
after prosecutors portrayed the fallen Panamanian ruler as a
wealthy and dangerous man with cash and armed supporters
potentially hidden around the world.
   ``Mr. Noriega is a danger to the community,'' said Deputy
Assistant U.S. Attorney Myles Malman said during the bond hearing.
``He is a military man trained and skilled in the use of
counter-terrorism, covert actions and weapons.''
   Prosecutors said the 145-year sentence Noriega could be given if
convicted of drug trafficking, coupled with his ``extraordinary
wealth,'' made it likely he would flee the country if released on
bond.

   President Bush is proposing a $500 million

say the plan also would cut veterans' homebuying benefits and trim
student loan programs.
   Bush on Monday unveils what sources say will be a record $1.23
trillion budget for the 1991 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
   The president told a conference of mayors on Friday that his
budget would build on the nation's recent prosperity and provide
``opportunity for all.''
   Even so, economists suggested some of the optimistic economic
projections built into Bush's budget are threatened by a weakening

   Big-city mayors, disappointed with President
Bush's anti-drug efforts, are asking the administration and
Congress to cut defense spending and raise taxes to finance
solutions for inner-city problems.
   The U.S. Conference of Mayors ended its three-day winter meeting
Friday after the president urged them to support his new drug
strategy and proposal to increase federal anti-narcotics drug
spending by $1.1 billion.
   But the mayors had more money in mind, and the group's
policy-making executive committee adopted a resolution urging the
immediate use of a ``peace dividend, in conjuction with increased
revenues,'' for an injection of new aid for America's cities.
   ``The Bush administration's approach is to force the poor people
to decide between heating and eating,'' said Newark, N.J., Mayor
Sharpe James, a Democrat. ``I think they need both.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The environment's importance as an issue shaping
the business landscape of the 1990s was brought into sharper focus
when two major oil companies took hefty slices from earnings to pay
pollution costs.
   Exxon Corp. said $500 million was to remedy damage already done,
while Chevron Corp. said $325 million was for future cleaning costs
at its U.S. refining, marketing and chemicals sites.
   Oil industry experts say the charges announced this past week
highlighted what is expected to be the biggest single concern
facing business, and the oil industry in particular, in the 1990s.
   ``Under any scenario, we're going to be spending more on the
environment _ clean air, waste management, oil spill legislation _
a whole series of things will impact the corporate bottom line as
never before ,'' said Terry F. Yosie, vice president for health and
environment for the American Petroleum Institute, the trade
association representing major oil companies and refiners.
   Outside the oil industry, environmentalism already has become a
byword for conducting business.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., for example, has become a leader in
pushing suppliers for more recycled or recyclable products.
McDonald's Corp. promotes recycling in advertising, while Polaroid
Corp. is emphasizing waste reduction and Consolidated Natural Gas
Co. is focusing on clean-burning technologies.
   Observers say the environment as a cost in planning, organizing
and setting corporate strategy is the reality of the future.
   ``We should as shareholders and investors become used to
environmental charges as a semi-permanent part of the financial
landscape for a long time,'' said Bernard Picchi, analyst and a
managing director for Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Picchi said that while the words ecology and environment
scarcely existed in the oil industry lexicon throughout most of its
150 year history, ``it's a fact of reality in late 20th century
America that citizens, government and corporations are becoming
aware of their environmental responsibility.''
   Exxon has been dangled before the public as an example of a
company that seemingly failed to recognize that responsibility.
Despite spending $2 billion to clean the Alaska oil spill, Exxon
still has not mended its reputation and remains the target of
rebuke everywhere from Capitol Hill to the Tonight Show.
   The March disaster, the nation's worst oil spill, blackened the
image of the entire industry.
   ``The public in general believes the industry's behavior and
goals still differ substantially from what they ought to be and I
think that's an untenable position for an industry to be in,''
Yosie said.
   That is changing. Sobered by Exxon's experience, other oil
companies are taking the initiative. The environment has become a
more central component of business strategy and is managed at a
higher level than before.
   In announcing its $355 million charge against fourth-quarter
earnings for anticipated environment-related expenses earlier this
month, Texaco President James W. Kinnear said, ``The company is
committed to its role in safeguarding and maintaining the
environment in which it operates.''
   Phillips Petroleum Co., Exxon and other companies recently
created new senior-level executive positions to bring the issue
closer to the seat of corporate decision-making. Amoco Corp., which
had had a corporate-level environmentalist for three years,
Atlantic Richfield Co., British Petroleum Co. and others are
changing management structures to deal with growing environmental
concerns.
   Furthermore, public and regulatory pressure is changing the
industry's products as the environment becomes a competitive issue.
Gasoline and the processes used to make it, for example, are
expected to undergo major changes in the 1990s to minimize
pollution.
   Still, critics contend the oil industry has a long way to go. In
most instances, it still reacts to problems instead of preventing
them, which creates the perception of foot-dragging.
   ``That, too, is untenable,'' Yosie said. ``If that doesn't
change, the industry will lose control of the way it manages its
business and CEOs are acutely aware of that.''
   In other business news this past week:
   _The stock and bond markets fell, rattled by fears of higher
worldwide interest rates. Meanwhile, new economic reports raised
recession fears in this country.
   _The nation's top life insurer, Prudential Insurance Company of
America, said it plans to allow terminally ill policyholders and
those permanently confined to nursing homes to tap into death
benefits while they are still alive, providing them cash to cover
the enormous cost of dying.
   _A suspended graduate student faced five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine after he was convicted on federal computer tampering
charges. Robert T. Morris was accused of unleashing a ``worm'' that
crippled a nationwide network of thousands of computers.
   _Drugstore giant Revco D.S., Inc., the first big company to seek
bankruptcy-court refuge from debts incurred in a leveraged buyout,
announced plans to sell 712 of its 1,873 stores in a costly
restructuring.

<HEAD>Bear Tracks on Wall Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As they pore over charts of the early-1990 slide
in stock prices, some Wall Street analysts say they are starting to
see the telltale tracks of a potentially nasty bear market.
   Veterans of the financial forecasting game caution that such
phenomena are notoriously tricky to identify for sure, at least
until well after they have come and gone.
   Furthermore, the species has grown unfamiliar, given that the
stock market has not experienced a long-term decline since the
early 1980s.
   But with those qualifications, many market-watchers say there
have been several developments to suggest that a new generation of
Wall Streeters might be headed for its first face-to-face encounter
with an old-fashioned bear.
   ``Bearishness can build, and it can build to an extreme,'' says
Joseph Feshbach, technical analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities.
``A bear market's purpose, after all, is to purge the extremes of
the prior bull market.
   ``Before it runs its course, this bear market will challenge and
ultimately destroy the long-term case for equities.''
   Those are strong words for a world that has weathered in recent
times both the crash of 1987 and the big break in stock prices that
occurred last Oct. 13.
   Pessimists point out, however, that both those declines were as
short as they were severe, and soon gave place to recoveries that
carried stocks to new highs.
   What is more, they say, the sudden 1987 and 1989 declines could
be seized upon as an opportunity for ``bargain hunting'' in stocks
where earnings prospects hadn't materially changed.
   Now, many analysts argue, stock prices may be falling without
getting much ``cheaper,'' because corporate earnings are slumping
badly too, and interest rates are rising at the same time.
   Rising rates increase yields on interest-bearing securities that
compete with stocks for investors' favor, and thus reduce the
relative appeal of stock dividend payouts.
   ``Recent price declines have not restored `fair value' to the
stock market,'' argues Abby Joseph Cohen, strategist at Drexel
Burnham Lambert, in a current market commentary.
   ``Corporate profit reports for the fourth quarter of 1989 have
thus far contained more disappointments than positive surprises,
and consensus expectations for 1990 continue to move lower. We
nonetheless believe that these profit forecasts are still too
high.''
   Amid such gloomy appraisals, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials skidded 118.67 points in the past week to a six-month
low of 2,559.23.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 7.35 to
180.21; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
fell 19.55 to 421.33, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was down 15.21 at 350.87.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 181.19 million shares a day,
against 172.26 million the week before.
   For a prime example of a modern bear market, many analysts cite
the 45 percent drop in stocks over a span of more than 20 months
from January 1973 through early December 1974.
   In the subsequent recovery, it took the Dow Jones industrial
average nearly 10 years to surpass its early-1973 peaks.
   Even in that relatively recent era, Wall Street communications
and order-processing systems were primitive by today's standards.
   Analysts see other reasons as well why a bear market at the
outset of the 1990s, if one is undeed underway, need not take so
long to complete.
   For one thing, they say, markets command greater attention from
government policymakers these days as a deregulated influence on
the well-being of the country as a whole.
   Should the economy slump further along with the stock market,
say the economists David A. Levy and S. Jay Levy in Chappaqua,
N.Y., ``its carnage _ and the resulting financial crisis _ would
command the Federal Reserve's attention ahead of all other
concerns.''
