<TEXT>
   Bernard ``Hap'' Kliban, a cartoonist whose
depictions of chubby, striped cats adorned T-shirts and were
featured in books, died Sunday. He was 55.
   Kliban, whose home was in Corte Madera north of San Francisco,
died at the University of California at San Francisco Medical
Center, according to the San Francisco Coroner's Office. The cause
of death wasn't immediately known, but Kliban had undergone heart
surgery July 31 at the hospital.
   Kliban's cat-design T-shirts included several best sellers, such
as one with a caption reading, ``Sex, Mice and Rock And Roll.''
   Many of his cartoon cats pursued human activities. They worked
at the office, skiied and spent summer at the beach.
   A popular poster featuring a Kliban cat read, ``Cat: one hell of
a nice animal, frequently mistaken for a meatloaf.''
   Books with his cartoons include ``Cat,'' ``Tiny Footprints,''
and ``Playboy's Kliban.''
   In addition to T-shirts, Kliban's cats were featured on
calendars, bed sheets, bath mats, beer mugs and umbrellas, among
other items.
   Harrods, the exclusive London department store, one year
established a special Christmas section for Kliban-abilia, and
Bloomingdale's had an 8-foot-high, 250-pound Kliban display cat on
sale _ for only $1,500.
   Neiman-Marcus, the upscale Dallas-based department store,
featured a non-feline Kliban creation _ camels toting rainbows _ on
its shopping bags and catalogs in 1981.
   As his fame grew, Kliban tried to avoid publicity. He even
stopped giving out his first name, admitting to just the initial
``B.''
   In a 1980 interview with People magazine, Kliban claimed he had
sworn off drawing cats for good. The cartoonist, who was allergic
to cats as a child, also said he didn't own any felines.
   He said he was born in Connecticut on New Year's Day, and thus
his nickname ``Hap,'' short for ``Happy New Year.'' Kliban went to
California in 1959.
   In his pre-cat days, he said, he drew pictures for ads and
corporate logos, and also for the annual reports for Kaiser
Aluminum.
   ``I was a beatnik,'' he said in an interview. ``I wore a black
turtleneck and black pants and hung around dark coffeehouses
drinking poisonous coffee.''
   Kliban said in another interview that if cartoonists ruled the
world, ``there would be weird cartoon sculptures 500 feet high and
free rubber chickens, regardless of a person's religious beliefs.''

<TEXT>
   When residents of North and South
Scripture Lane see a foreigner wandering down their alley, they can
guess why.
   ``Are you looking for descendants of the Jews?'' asked an old
man sitting beside the dirt lane in his undershirt, and told the
visitor about Li, who lived a few streets away.
   He waved a hand toward where Zhao lived, but would not take the
stranger there. `He's not accepting visitors anymore,'' the old man
said. ``He's had too many.''
   Zhao Pingyu, 68, is one of a few hundred descendants of Jews
living in this ancient center of Judaism, 390 miles from Beijing in
Henan province.
   Kaifeng, the imperial capital from the 10th to the 13th century,
once was home to thousands of Jews, but they gradually became so
assimilated that little is left to distinguish them except their
memories and stories.
   In the 1980s, as China opened to the outside world, Kaifeng
officials sought to cash in on the mystique of Jews in China to
draw attract tourists. Their attitude appears to have changed since
the crackdown last year on ``bourgeois liberalism,'' the catch
phrase for Western ideas.
   When a New York family held a bat mitzvah in Kaifeng last month
for their daughter's coming of age, their requests for permission
to invite the local Jewish community were ignored.
   Zhao said the Kaifeng foreign affairs office had told him not to
receive foreigners except at official receptions, then he added:
``But if people come on their own to my house, how can I not invite
them in? That would be inhospitable.''
   Although neighbors are reluctant to take people to Zhao,
visitors have little trouble finding him. Zhao is well-known in
Kaifeng because he is one of the few Jews with knowledge of Jewish
history and culture.
   He lives with his wife, a non-Jew, in a large room at the back
of a courtyard on South Scripture Lane that once was part of the
synagogue compound.
   The synagogue was built in 1163 and stood for 700 years through
10 renovations. It eventually was destroyed by flooding from the
Yellow River, and the No. 4 People's Hospital now stands on the
site.
   Zhao has a diagram of the synagogue, which his
great-great-grandfather restored after retiring from an imperial
court office.
   A few years ago, after his own retirement from the tax bureau,
Zhao started building a model of the synagogue, which included
three elaborate worship halls and several side buildings. Much work
still remains.
   One of the three stone tablets displayed in Kaifeng's museum
exhibit on Jews in China came from Zhao's family. The tablets are
the Jews' best historical record.
   Jewish merchants arrived in China in the 7th century, joining
other traders on the journey along the Silk Road or by sea from
south India.
   Thousands settled in Kaifeng, eventually creating China's
largest Jewish community and the one that lasted longest. As
recently as 200 years ago, 2,000 to 3,000 Jews worshipped weekly in
the Kaifeng's synagogue.
   By the mid-19th century, the Jews had intermarried and become
assimilated. They adopted the customs of the majority Han Chinese
or the Moslems, forgot the Hebrew language and took Chinese names.
   A survey of Kaifeng in 1980 found only 79 Jewish families with
166 members. Other accounts say Kaifeng's population of 500,000
includes up to 300 descendants of Jews.
   Zhao and other Jews in the old imperial capital do not observe
Jewish rituals or holidays, but he remembers eating unleavened
bread for the Passover meal as a child. Many Chinese Jews observed
Passover during the Chinese Lunar New Year.
   Even though he does not practice Judaism, Zhao maintains his
sense of Jewish identity.
   ``When the Jews come here from foreign countries, I feel there's
some connection, some relationship by blood,'' he said. ``They're
our friends and our brothers.''
   A menorah given him by an American Jew is displayed in the
middle of Zhao's room, but he never uses the ceremonial
candleholder. A blue yarmulke, handmade by one of his daughters,
hangs on a wall.
   ``I have five daughters,'' he said. ``That's a good thing for a
Jew, because Judaism is passed down through the mother.''
   Zhao's household registration lists him as a Jew, but his new
citizen identification card says says he is Han Chinese.
   He said one daughter was so adamant about being Jewish that she
refused to get an identification card, because it would identify
her as Han Chinese.
   China has 54 minority groups. It does not recognize Jews as a
minority because they no longer have a language or customs to
distinguish them from Han Chinese.
   Moslems, who still practice their religion and have kept their
traditions, are China's second-largest minority. They have token
representation in government and the Communist Party and are
entitled to special treatment.

<DATELINE>ST. HELENA ISLAND, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ernice Dean lives in a small,
weather-beaten home on this tiny sea island, on land that has been
in her family for generations. But the land may not belong to her
much longer.
   Ms. Dean, like hundreds of other descendants of freed slaves in
South Carolina, has found she cannot keep pace with rising property
taxes brought on by increased property values.
   ``I was paying $280 and now I have to pay about $400
(annually),'' said Ms. Dean, who has been forced to let four other
people live on her property in order to pay the tax bill.
   St. Helena Island, population 6,230, about 40 miles from lavish
Hilton Head Island, is one of more than 100 sea islands stretching
from Charleston to Savannah, Ga. The islands, dotted with marshes
and lined with palmetto trees, were settled by slaves freed during
the Civil War.
   Today, warm breezes and fresh seafood make the island chain a
magnet for visitors.
   But with tourism has come development that has driven up land
prices and taxes, and that threatens the residents, many of whom
are poor and subsist on what they can grow in their gardens and
catch in the sea.
   Last fall, Beaufort County auctioned off 87 properties _ up 42
percent from the previous year _ for about $1 million because the
owners were unable to pay their taxes.
   ``The main source of income, the industry of tourism, pays low
wages and is seasonal,'' said Emory Campbell, director of the Penn
Community Center which has helped the islanders with land problems
since its founding in 1862.
   ``It emphasizes exclusivity and results in increased property
values. You find that it is extremely out of balance. Income from
tourism does not sustain the increased cost of taxes, housing and
food.''
   Tourism is a $5 billion-a-year industry in South Carolina.
   Beaufort County treasurer Eldrid Moody also blames the county's
spending habits. The county, he said, spends more money and has
more employees than many its size.
   ``Taxes are high because we refuse to control spending,'' Moody
said. ``My concern with Beaufort County is that we don't have to
buy the best or build the best. We need to put a measuring stick on
the ability to pay of the masses.''
   Beaufort County has 45,000 fewer residents than neighboring
Berkeley County, but a budget that is greater by $9.9 million. In
addition, the population has grown only 4.2 percent annually since
1980, while the budget has mushroomed 18 percent a year, Moody said.
   County Council chairman Bill Bowen defended the county's budget
and tax structure.
   ``Those quote, poor people, are the ones who require the most
services from the county through welfare services and receive the
most for their tax dollar,'' he said.
   Residents who lost their property in last year's tax sale have
until October to buy it back, but many are impoverished. Some lost
their land for failing to pay tax bills as low as $300.
   The County Council has discussed the tax dilemma, but Bowen
isn't sure the council should do anything.
   ``If someone can't afford to own property because they cannot
pay taxes then they shouldn't own the property,'' he said. ``If I
can't pay my taxes because my property has gotten so valuable, then
I sell my property for a profit and move to an area where it is
like it used to be.''
   There are fewer and fewer places where it's ``like it used to
be,'' Campbell said.
   A study conducted eight years ago by the Penn Center found that
35 percent of the land in Beaufort County was owned by blacks. He
doesn't have current figures, but believes that's decreased.
   ``It's driving people from a situation where they're surviving
to an inner-city situation, such as public-subsidized housing, or
even a homeless situation,'' Campbell said. ``People usually don't
have any sympathy. There needs to be some kind of recognition of
the indigenous use of land.
   ``Before you know it, the thing that attracted tourism and
development is gone. You've ruined your lakes and streams with
marinas and you've wiped out the native population.''

   President Bush ordered Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney back to the tense Persian Gulf, officials
said Monday, as American combat troops arriving in Saudi Arabia
were told to brace for a long stay.
   Bush said he would break away from his vacation for a day and
return to the White House on Tuesday for deficit-reduction talks
with his advisers and a briefing at the Pentagon on the military
faceoff with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the naval
barricade against Iraq had forced two or three ships to turn back
at sea, and he declared ``the embargo is being maintained'' on
shipping into and out of Iraq.
   He also defended the inclusion of food shipments to Iraq under
global sanctions, saying the purpose of the embargo is ``to put the
pinch on them'' and deny supplies ``that allow them to maintain the
war machine.''
   In Washington, the State Department said about 500 Americans had
quietly slipped out of Kuwait in the face of Iraqi efforts to keep
Westerners from leaving.
   In Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, a 27-year-old sergeant stepped off a
plane at a Saudi air base and summed up the concerns of many
American soldiers: ``Yes, it's scary. You have to build up the
courage and put the fear aside and do what you have to do.'' The
soldier, from Claymont, Del., had a gas mask on his belt.
   ``They are telling us to be ready to stay four to six months,''
said the soldier. The military did not permit troops to be
identified by name.
   The Pentagon said Cheney will fly to Saudi Arabia on Friday to
visit U.S. troops and meet with the kingdom's leaders. It is his
second trip to the Persian Gulf since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Cheney may visit other
countries before returning to Washington next Tuesday. The
secretary stopped in Egypt and Morocco on his earlier trip to Saudi
Arabia.
   Bush, meanwhile, is to return to his oceanside retreat on
Wednesday and then shuttle back and forth to Washington between now
and Labor Day.
   Fitzwater said the Persian Gulf crisis underscored the need for
a budget-cutting agreement between Congress and the White House.
   ``There needs to be a unity of purpose in this country not only
about the conflict in the gulf but also about our spending issues
and about where the budget is going,'' Fitzwater said.
   As global economic sanctions squeezed Iraq, the military buildup
grew steadily in the Persian Gulf area. Planes carrying U.S. troops
and equipment were landing about every 10 minutes, one military
official said. Bush has committed an estimated 50,000 U.S. forces
to the gulf so far.
   Sources said the battleship Wisconsin, meantime, has reached the
eastern Mediterranean.
   The Bush administration says the military buildup and the
embargo are designed to deter a possible Iraqi invasion of Saudi
Arabia and to force Baghdad to pull its conquering force out of
Kuwait.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler estimated there
are now about 2,500 Americans in the Iraqi-held country in addition
to 500 to 600 in Iraq itself.
   U.S. officials said some of Americans have been able to take
advantage of lax Iraqi security at the final check point on Kuwaiti
territory to cross the border into Saudi Arabia. However, David
Thomas Croskery, a Briton who apparently tried to flee by the same
route was shot to death Saturday, and Ms. Tutwiler said the
administration was ``shocked and extremely concerned'' by that
action.
   She and Fitzwater, in Kennebunkport, criticized Iraqi reports
that foreigners were free to leave Kuwait. ``We now have cars lined
up at the Saudi border who are unable to get out,'' he said.
   The White House spokesman said the global economic embargo
against Iraq would restrict food supplies for the time being,
although there is an exemption for medical products.
   Overall, Fitzwater said, ``We assess the impact of the embargo
as excellent. To our knowledge, ships are not arriving. The embargo
is being maintained.''
   He said, ``We have had two or three ships in recent hours that
have turned away or been turned away, or at least have otherwise
not landed with their cargo.'' None of the ships was engaged in a
confrontation with U.S. ships, Fitzwater said.
   U.S. intelligence officials were keeping an eye on a particular
ship suspected of hauling Polish-made small arms bound for Iraq,
according to reports by NBC News, The Washington Post and The New
York Times.
   Jane Gaffney, a spokeswoman for the State Department, said
Monday she had no information about about the ship.
   Explaining the decision to restrict food, Fitzwater said, ``The
purpose of the sanctions and the embargo is to put the pinch on
them. It seems fairly obvious to me you don't let foodstuffs and
other things go in that are subject to the sanctions.
   ``The purpose is not let supplies go in that allow them to
maintain the war machine, allow them to maintain their aggressive
takeover of Kuwait,'' Fitzwater said. ``You don't give them the
essentials that enable them to carry on the war.''
   The administration did not want to use the word ``blockade'' to
describe its quarantine of Iraq. ``We're not interested in
semantics. We're interdicting ships. That's our policy,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Bush called Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez to discuss
the gulf situation and world oil supplies, Fitzwater said. U.S.
officials have said Venezuela, a member of OPEC, is stepping up oil
production to help offset the cutoff of Iraqi and Kuwait oil.
   Asked about reports that Jordan was letting shipments through to
Iraq, Fitzwater said, ``We are hopeful that Jordan will comply.
They have said they will abide by the sanctions.'' He noted that
the Gulf of Aqaba, a Jordanian port, has been a traditional trade
route for Iraq.
   ``There may be activity in that area,'' he said.
   Asked why the United States would block food shipments,
Fitzwater said, ``We have obvious humanitarian concerns but we have
also very real military concerns and this is a force that is after
all threatening many countries of the world. It is a leader who has
killed people by his own hand and by his own forces.''

   We witnessed the unthinkable: the
invasion and conquest of Kuwait by fellow Arab troops of Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein.
   We first encountered their ugly tanks on the streets of Kuwait
City. Eight days later, we managed to escape to Bahrain.
   Here are my notes of the nightmare:
   Thursday, Aug. 2: As I approached the Gulf Bank, I saw many cars
outside and people were inside to draw cash. Indians, Kuwaitis,
Pakistanis, Eygptians, Palestinians, Americans, and others were
outside the building. Some were yelling ``Go home, go home ... Iraq
has invaded Kuwait.''
   I drove home. Troops were streaming in and heavy vehicles
rumbling down Istiklal (independence) boulevard. Friends called and
told my family to get ready for war. How the hell do you get ready
for war? Fill the bathtubs with water, buy as much canned food as
possible. Buy water, call your kin and see if they have any plans
to escape. Then, wait.
   We turned on the radio and took it along with mattresses down to
the basement.
   Friday, Aug. 3: Whatever little sleep we could have we had. It
was at that point that we heard bombs. Friends invited us to spend
the night at their house. We went. The streets were empty, silent.
   There were about five radio sets tuned to the BBC, another on
Voice of America, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, and Iraq (radio). It was
horrible to hear what they (Iraqi radio) said, especially, since we
knew that they were all lies ... that the Iraqis were in Kuwait to
save its people ...
   Saturday, Aug. 4: We woke up to the sound of bombs. They were
coming from an area called Kifan, where young Kuwaitis had obtained
rifles and were harassing the Iraqis. We were proud of them.
   Friends called and said the Iraqis were looting shops and houses
of rich people who were abroad. They said the Central Bank was
looted too, along with car showrooms.
   We heard distant shelling and were told the Iraqis were trying
to silence Kuwaiti guns at Shuwaikh.
   Sunday, Aug. 5: The Iraqis installed a new government, a joke of
a government, a group of young Iraqis who tried over television to
tell us they were Kuwaiti. Their accent betrayed their real
nationality, despite their white robes and ghutra headgear.
   Wednesday, Aug. 8: We listened to the radio newscast. A friend
called to see if we wanted to leave Kuwait. We refused.
   It was also the same evening that (President) Bush talked. I
cried when Mr. Bush said he wanted the American people to pray for
the men and women who will be fighting for the principles of
freedom and democracy.
   I am Arab, and I felt bad that we had to ask for foreign help to
defend ourselves against an invasion by fellow Arabs. It was sad,
but I understood it was necessary.
   An American friend of my father's had a heart attack. My sister
and I went to him at hospital immediately. His condition improved
but (he) was anxious to be with the rest of his family.
   Thursday, Aug. 9: I went to hospital to visit the American and
his wife and give them a radio set to listen to newscasts. When I
returned home, a friend of ours, called Nasser, was there to offer
us an escape plan, which we accepted.
   It pained our hearts to leave Kuwait. I am Saudi Arabian, but I
have lived all my years here in this country. Friends told my
father the Iraqis had rounded up foreigners, mainly American and
British, and taken them to Baghdad as hostages.
   Shortly after 11 in the morning Nasser came and picked us up. We
took what we can, some of our gold and important papers and left.
My heart was tearing up as we drove down Fahaheel road, where two
other families in their cars joined us.
   We were stopped at an Iraqi checkpoint. Nasser argued with one
of the soldiers who let us through.
   We saw Iraqi soldiers near the border. Nasser stopped then
turned right to the desert. The soldiers waved to us to get back.
We ignored them. My heart was beating so fast I could not hear
anything. We began to pray. We knew the Iraqis shoot first at the
tires, then come and smash the cars and take occupants out. There
were many destroyed cars along the border. We didn't (see) what
Iraqis did with the occupants. No shots were fired at us, but we
couldn't get over fear.
   Nasser told us to start singing, to overcome fear. The three
cars were running very fast. It took 15 minutes through the desert
to reach the Saudi border, which we crossed into the Khafji region.
   We drove on to Nasser's house there. My father, uncle and aunt
were there. We resumed driving, this time in safer areas. We
crossed the 15-mile causeway on the (Persian) Gulf and entered
Bahrain.

   ISRAEL: Israel occupied the Golan Heights, the West Bank, and
the Gaza Strip from Syria, Jordan and Egypt in June 1967. Arabs
envisage establishing an independent Palestinian state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. The West Bank is 2,270 square miles and is
home to 1 million Palestinians. The Gaza Strip is 140 square miles,
and houses 750,000 Palestinians. Some 70,000 Israelis live in these
territories.
   The Arabs have rejected the 1981 annexation of the Golan
Heights, which cover some 454 square miles of land and house 24,000
people, including 10,000 Jews.

   LEBANON: Syria, Iraq's main Arab enemy, controls about 70
percent of Lebanon. Syria entered Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab
League mandate to quell the Civil War, now in its 16th year.
   It has since maintained some 40,000 troops in Moslem regions in
the north and east as well as west Beirut. Some 2.5 million people
live in Syrian-controlled regions.
   In southern Lebanon, Israel holds a self-designated security
zone of about 400 square miles. Israel established the security
zone in 1985, after withdrawing the bulk of its army from Lebanon,
three years after it invaded. The purpose of the zone, the Israelis
claim, is to guard against cross-border guerrilla raids.

   IRAN-IRAQ: Iran says Iraq still holds 772 square miles of its
territories, occupied in the closing weeks of the 1980-88 gulf war.
But the United Nations says the area is half that size.
   The occupied Iranian territories, near the southern sector of
the border, are totally deserted, having witnessed heavy fighting
during the war. Hostilities were halted on Aug. 20, 1988, by a
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire.
   Iran controls the eastern bank of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, a
vital Iraqi outlet to the gulf. Iraq wants full control on the
channel, a confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Saddam
would trade Iranian territories for full sovreignty over the
waterway.

   KUWAIT: The small gulf sheikdom comprises 6,880 square miles.
More than half of its population of 1.8 million is composed of
foreigners, mainly Arabs, including some 400,000 Palestinians.
Kuwait gained independence from Britain in 1961 and has since been
confronted with Iraqi claims that it is part of that country.
   The threat turned into a reality Aug. 2, when tens of thousands
of Iraqi troops rumbled in from the north, occupying Kuwait within
hours and touching off the latest crisis in the volatile, oil-rich
region.

<HEAD>With PM-Iraq-Kuwait Rdp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's proposal to solve the Persian Gulf crisis, carried
by Baghdad radio and the official Iraqi News Agency and translated
from Arabic by The Associated Press:
   In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful.
   In an attempt on our part to create a peaceful atmosphere in the
region and place the region in a stable situation and in order to
reveal America and its ally the monster Israel and its small
allies, and their crimes against the nation, we have decided to
propose the following initiative.
   The United States has tried to cover its moves against humanity
and the people of this region by pretending that the economic
sanctions against Iraq are to protest the aid given by Iraq to the
people of Kuwait, who have saved themselves from the rule of the
Sabah family. It lost its mind the day the Kuwaitis and Iraqis
decided to re-establish what British colonialism had cut between
Iraq and Kuwait, as Kuwait was a part of Iraq until World War I.
Iraq has never recognized the crime committed by the colonialists.
   America started gathering its naval armada and warplanes and
beat the drums of war against Iraq as an excuse to confront the
Iraqi threat to Saudi Arabia.
   Because the spark of war it started will burn many and will
cause those who are in its arena great catastrophies; and in order
to place the facts as they are in the face of world public opinion
and the Western one in particular; and to reveal the phony
allegations of America that it supports peoples' rights, when
actually it only seeks to preserve the interests of the West:
   I propose that all cases of occupation, and those cases that
have been portrayed as occupation, in the region, be resolved
simultaneouly and on the same principles and basis that should be
laid (down) by the (U.N.) Securty Council, as follows.
   Preparation for an immediate and unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from occupied Arab lands in Palestine, Syria and
Lebanon; a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon; mutual withdrawals by
Iraq and Iran and arrangement for the situation in Kuwait.
   All military withdrawals and all related political arrangements
should take into consideration Iraq's historical territorial rights
and guarantee the Kuwaiti people's right to decide on their future.
   The basis of the program should be all United Nations and
Security Council resolutions, both to arrive at the earliest
possible solution, and to apply the same action taken by the
Security Council against Iraq on any party that does not comply
with these arrangements and answer to them.
   In order to reveal the facts to the world public opinion, to
judge them according to objective conditions, away from American
wishes and pressure, we call for the immediate withdrawal of
American forces and all other forces that responded to this plot
from Saudi Arabia, to be replaced by an Arab force, whose duties,
nationality, size and area of deployment should be determined by
the Security Council aided by the secretary-general of the United
Nations. In deciding the nationality of these forces, they should
not include any troops from Egypt, which is being used by the
United States as a cornerstone in its conspiracies against the
Arabs. There should be an immediate freeze of all boycott and siege
decisions, and matters should go back to normal in economic,
political and scientific dealings between Iraq and the world, or
these (sanctions) should be imposed on any party refusing to comply
and respond to the conditions stated above.
   Should the United States, its allies and its agents fail to
respond to our initiative, then we as the people of Iraq along with
our brethren in the Arab world will resist its evil intentions and
aggressive schemes. We will fight America's evil plans, with help
from the good people of our Arab nation and our great Iraqi people,
and we will be victorious with God's help. The evil-doers will
regret their acts when they are driven out in shame from the region.

   Finding shells on the beach isn't cause to
close the shoreline to sunbathers _ unless they're aging,
unexploded artillery rounds.
   Most of Bukroe Beach was open today after officials and
volunteers using metal detectors found 32 artillery shells, some
dating to World War I, in sand dredged from Chesapeake Bay.
   A one-mile stretch of beach was closed Saturday because of the
artillery shells. All but an 800-foot section that needed to be
checked further was reopened late Sunday.
   Hampton Fire Battalion Chief Richard C. Blakeslee said the
shells were dredged from an area two miles offshore apparently used
for target practice.
   ``These are rounds that have been fired, but upon impact failed
to go off,'' he said.
   The shells measured about 3 inches in diameter and 10 inches in
length. They came ashore with sand dredged from the bay in a $1
million beach restoration project that began Aug. 3.
   An ordnance disposal team from Langley Air Force Base took the
shells.
   The munitions dating to World War I and World War II were
probably not dangerous, police and military officers said.
   But Blakeslee said the danger was real.
   ``All of them still have the explosive material inside the
shell,'' he said. They ``were designed to take aircraft down'' and
``can be capable of doing their job for up to 200 years.''

<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's appeal early Sunday to Iraqi women, read over
Baghdad radio by an announcer and monitored and translated by The
Associated Press in Nicosia.
   Saddam addressed the women as mujahedat, or female holy
warriors, and majeda, or glorious women. He reviewed at length
their role in supporting Iraqi men in previous wars, including the
1980-88 war with Iran, and to the burden of caring for their
families while the men were at the battlefront.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Today, you have additional responsibilities to those you had
shouldered before. You are called to take on a special role in all
the social and domestic affairs...
   The role that is suitable for you today, dear majeda, is that of
organizing the economic life from the entire society in addition to
your previous duties. It is when the economic life is organized in
accordance with the overall plan we seek that we can consider the
battle over in favor of Iraq and the invaders deceived, fleeing one
after the other...
   It is then that we will possess all the potentials to take on
all the amassed forces of evil and those who might be massed in the
next two months...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   What is demanded is that the amount of food in pots or on the
table be limited to only what we really need ... and that the table
not be crowded as the tradition has been with various dishes and
types of fruit...
   What is demanded is that no one stockpile food supplies in his
home and that he keeps only what is needed for the day or a week.
Stockpiling will bring about shortages....
   I know, as well as you do, that Iraqi families, even those with
limited income, are able to live for a year without purchasing
clothes or food...
   Each family should take the initiative and tell its neighbor how
instead of consuming 5 or 10 kilograms (11 to 22 pounds) of meat a
month, it has cut down its consumption by half... It is with this
that we can hit the core of the American schemes which they have
plotted against us in accordance with the mentality that money is
everything in life...
   Even during the war with Iran, our lives were not lacking except
the very trivial things.
   Today, however, after the forces of evil took the decision of
boycott and siege, what is required is an attitude of more
awareness...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I don't believe the patriotic awareness of any of you accepts
that one stockpiles whatever he can to leave another in distress...
thus diverting the attention away from the needs of the men as they
prepare themselves for the battle should it break out.
   I don't believe any of you accepts to stockpile more of what is
needed while we all stand on equal footing in the same trench...
   Master your role as you have done in the past so Iraq can emerge
triumphant as it has in the past...
   Iraq's national wealth is abundant... Our supplies of essential
needs and foodstuffs is great. So victory is on our side and defeat
is certain for the aggressors who have pinned all their hopes to
their economic sanctions and to their forces and their useless
fleets.

   More than half the foreigners in Kuwait
are Arabs from other countries, but there are also Iranians,
Indians, Pakistanis and a small number of Westerners.
   In the population of about 1.8 million, no more than 700,000 are
Kuwaiti nationals.
   About 400,000 Palestinians made Kuwait their second home. They
are prominent in professions such as medicine, law, banking,
engineering and teaching. There are also 250,000 Egyptians, many of
them also in the professions.
   There are 100,000 Iranian citizens in Kuwait. Most of them seem
loyal to the emir, even though Iran began fomenting terrorism and
firing missiles at the Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War against
Iraq.
   Among the foreigners in Kuwait are 300,000 Indians, Pakistanis
and nationals of other Third World nations, including the
Philippines.
   There are also much small numbers of Westerners, perhaps
10-20,000, including about 3,000 Americans.
   Of the Americans, the largest groups are diplomats and oil
workers, but there are also bankers, teachers and other professions.

   The pilot, navigator and bombardier of the
plane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima say they have no
reservations about making a buck off their place in history.
   In recent months, they've been hopscotching the country, hawking
books, T-shirts, caps and coffee mugs commemorating the Aug. 6,
1945, bombing that claimed nearly 100,000 Japanese lives and
hastened the end of World War II.
   It's simple supply and demand, says 75-year-old retired Brig.
Gen. Paul W. Tibbets Jr., the pilot of the bomber Enola Gay.
   He spent years speaking for free at Kiwanis and Rotary luncheons.
   ``None of these organizations that ask you to come and talk
offer you any kind of compensation for doing it,'' he said. ``I
unfortunately arrived at the point they expect you to do it. You
owe it to them.
   ``Well, I don't think I owe anybody a damn thing.''
   Setsuko Thurlow, founder and co-chairwoman of Hiroshima-Nagasaki
Relived, a Toronto-based anti-nuclear group, finds that attitude
appalling. She was 13 when she was buried in the rubble from the
bomb, which killed her sister and niece.
   ``I think it is commercial exploitation of the hundreds of
thousands of people who were killed,'' she said. ``I do question
their sense of morality. Whatever they did, you would think they
would feel at least a part of the collective guilt.''
   But Tibbets said: ``It's never dawned on me that I'm trying to
capitalize on anybody's death. My reaction to that is, I tell them
that they're wrong.''
   Last August, Tibbets' hooked up with an agent, Clark St. John of
Buckeye Aviation Publishing Co., which published his book, ``Flight
of the Enola Gay.''
   They began touring shopping malls and air shows, and later
persuaded Enola Gay navigator Theodore ``Dutch'' Van Kirk and
bombardier Tom Ferebee to join them. Since then, they've visited
Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.
   Both Tibbets and St. John declined to say how much money was
coming in.
   ``Nobody's getting rich here,'' said St. John. ``But I would say
we're certainly in the black.''
   Tibbets said it quickly became apparent they were an attraction.
   ``We found out that people came in and they had all kinds of
pictures _ they wanted pictures autographed,'' he said. ``They were
interested in the book, but they had their own mementos. You know,
`Will you autograph this, will you autograph that?'''
   That prompted St. John and Tibbets to develop their own package
of wares, including Enola Gay coffee mugs ($6), T-shirts ($9),
sweatshirts ($12.95), videos ($19.95 and $24.95), photographs ($6
and $9) and a copy of the order authorizing use of the atomic bomb
($5).
   The mugs and shirts bear the insignia the group that dropped the
bomb and the words ``first atomic bombardment.'' The mugs also bear
Tibbets' name.
   Big sellers, said St. John, are Tibbets' book ($14.95) and a
limited edition color lithograph, selling for $24.95, depicting the
bomber climbing away as the mushroom cloud blossomed over Hiroshima.
   Autographs and handshakes are free.
   ``The general does not charge for an autograph,'' St. John said.
``He refuses to get involved in a gimmick like that.''
   At a recent book signing in Salt Lake City, people who stopped
by the trio's table included a couple of former members of Tibbets'
509th Composite Group, who snapped off smart salutes to their
former commanding officer. The group trained at Wendover, Utah, in
1944-45.
   Visitors also included other World War II veterans.
   ``Thanks,'' said one gray-haired man, whose wife took snapshots
of him shaking hands with Tibbets. ``I was a Marine in the South
Pacific and I sure as hell didn't want to have to invade Japan.''
   Japan surrendered five days after a second bomb was dropped on
Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945.
   Van Kirk said he joined Tibbets and Ferebee on the road because
it gives him an opportunity to refresh the memories of his
countrymen, fading 45 years after V-J Day.
   ``You know, I had a young reporter once ask me how to spell
`Hiroshima,''' he said. ``I think there's an amazing lack of
knowledge in this country about what went on in those days.
   ``If I'm lending even a little bit of knowledge to some people
... I think I'm making a contribution.''

   ABC newsman Sam Donaldson says he might be
too nice.
   The acid-tongued reporter pulled his punches during verbal
sparring with ``PrimeTime Live'' co-anchor Diane Sawyer when the
low-rated show premiered last year, he said in the Aug. 18 issue of
TV Guide.
   ``I could not bring myself to slap Diane across the chops,'' he
said. ``With George Will (his sparring partner on ABC's ``This Week

thing, I don't know. I haven't analyzed the motivation.''
   Despite the show's failure to attract a large audience,
Donaldson said pairing him with Ms. Sawyer was no mistake.
   ``I used to think I was the hardest worker in this business,''
he said. ``I've at least got one rival. ... Diane and I are a team,
and we usually agree on what we've done that's dumb and what we've
done that's on the mark. In theory, we ought to have been Astaire

   NEW YORK (AP) _ With the fifth, and reportedly final, ``Rocky''
movie in the can, Sylvester Stallone says maybe now fans can get to
know who he really is.
   ``Rocky's not me. I don't accept all the accolades that Rocky
gets,'' Stallone said in the September issue of Vanity Fair. ``The
people are responding to the character. When they're cheering,
they're cheering for Rocky.''
   He said his Hollywood image was created mainly by his tough-guy
screen characters and divorces, especially his split with actress
Brigitte Nielsen. But he said he's not bitter.
   ``If anybody should have become an alcoholic or a drug addict or
a dyed-in-the wool misogynist, it's me,'' Stallone said. ``I've had
every opportunity to cop out. I've been publicly humiliated ... and
held up to ridicule. I've never read about a divorce that had as
much sexual innuendo as mine did with Brigitte. That was very
embarrassing.''
   ``Rocky V,'' scheduled for release in November, is supposed to
be the final episode in the saga of Philadelphia fighter Rocky
Balboa's rise to heavyweight champion.

   A test that blows puffs of oxygen at the eye
identified Alzheimer's patients in a group of elderly people,
suggesting it may help in diagnosing the mind-robbing disease, a
researcher says.
   The test, which employs a form of learning made famous by
Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov, identified 19 of 20 people who had
been diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's, said Diana Woodruff-Pak.
But it also put seven of 20 healthy subjects in the same category,
an error rate that must be reduced, she said.
   After more research, the procedure may become a useful addition
to the battery of tests used to diagnose Alzheimer's, she said.
   Woodruff-Pak is a psychology professor at Temple University in
Philadelphia and director of the Philadelphia Geriatric Center's
Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory. She spoke at a weekend session
of the American Psychological Association's annual meeting, and in
a later interview.
   Her study is ``intriguing, it's tantalizing,'' said Deborah
Claman, program director for neuropsychology at the National
Institute on Aging in Bethesda, Md. More research must be done
before the test's usefulness can be assessed, she said.
   Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder. It
causes gradual memory loss, impairment of judgment, disorientation,
personality changes, difficulty learning and loss of language
skills.
   Woodruff-Pak's test checks for a form of learning called
classical conditioning. Essentially, that is learning to associate
one stimulus with another. Pavlov showed dogs can learn that a
particular sound meant a meal was coming.
   In the new experiment, participants wore an apparatus that
placed the mouth of a tube close to one eye. They heard a beep
lasting for a half-second, during which the tube blew a puff of
oxygen into the eye, making them blink.
   This was done repeatedly, and the test was to see how often
people blinked when they heard the beep but before the puff.
   Performance in healthy people declines with age, with
significant drops in middle age, Woodruff-Pak said.
   The elderly people were tested as they watched a silent movie.
The combination of beep and puff was given 90 times, at random
intervals of 10 seconds to 20 seconds.
   Each participant's performance was scored in terms of what
percentage of the 90 trials produced even a partial blink before
the puff.
   As a group, the Alzheimer patients scored at 11 percent. The
healthy people, who were of similar ages, scored at 32 percent.
   The result indicates a lack of classical conditioning in the
Alzheimer group, Woodruff-Pak said.
   When a cutoff of 25 percent was used, all but one of the
Alzheimer patients failed to meet the standard. All but seven of
the healthy people scored above the mark.
   The healthy subjects are being studied again, about a year after
the experiment, Woodruff-Pak said.
   At least two of the seven participants who had scored below the
standard on the eyeblink test have lost ground on a separate test
used to diagnose dementia, she said. Those who had scored above the
eyeblink standard appear to be largely stable on this test, with
about two-thirds of them retested so far, she said.
   That preliminary result suggests the eyeblink test may help pick
up early cases of Alzheimer's, she said.
   Researchers also found that patients whose dementia was due to
areas of impaired blood supply in the brain scored higher on the
eyeblink test than Alzheimer patients did. That suggests that the
test may help in distinguishing Alzheimer's from other types of
dementia, Woodruff-Pak said.
   The difference was expected because poor performance on the
eyeblink test appears related to defects in certain parts of the
brain, she said. All Alzheimer patients should have those defects,
but only some of the other demented patients would, she said.

   A can of soup believed about 135 years
old has stood the test of time, although no one is willing to give
it a taste test.
   Scientists studying the tin can of consomme-like soup say a
chemical analysis determined that it is still edible and nutritious.
   The government's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organization received the can in 1945 from its liaison officer in
London. He obtained it from a friend whose grandfather ran a store,
the group said.
   The research organization believes the soup dates to the 1853-56
Crimean War in which Great Britain, France, Turkey and Sardinia
defeated Russia.
   David Hall, of the Canned Food Information Service, said the
ancient soup is believed to be a light, meat-based broth containing
some vegetables.
   He said the can is an early example of canning technology and
helps to understand how canned food can retain its nutritional
value without preservatives.

   A monument titled Hill of Sorrow has been
dedicated in the Ukraine to the millions of peasants who died in
the 1933 famine engineered by Stalin to force them onto collective
farms.
   The simple monument, on the outskirts of Lubna, takes the form
of a burial mound topped by a cross, surrounded by a row of sticks
planted in the ground and crowned with small sheafs of rye.
   The monument was consecrated Sunday in a public religious
ceremony, the evening news show Vremya said. It was approved by a
council comprised of religious, government, cultural and other
leaders.
   More than 5 million people are believed to have died in the
famine, mostly in the Ukraine.

   The native peoples concluded a 30-nation gathering in arctic
Norway on Sunday with a resolution that said ``the unlimited
exploitation of natural wealth and related pollution will lead to
disaster for all.''
   The World Council of Indigenous Peoples, after a four-day
meeting of 400 delgates in Tromsoe, Norway, called for an immediate
ban on nuclear weapons testing.
   The colorful assembly, including Eskimos and American Indians,
rejected any celebration of the 500th anniversary of Columbus
discovering America in 1492.
   It said the date marks the start of ``the invasion of our lands,
the genocide ... against our Indian communities'' and that the 1992
anniversary should instead be used to call attention to the current
problems of indigenous peoples.

<HEAD>Bad Chip Like `Stuck Traffic Light,' But Magellan OK for Venus
Mapping</HEAD>

   One of the Magellan spacecraft's backup
computers rejected commands when a memory chip failed, but the
glitch won't hurt the $744 million exploration of Venus, engineers
say.
   ``It's like a stuck traffic light. It's not allowing the proper
flow of commands,'' said Tommy Thompson, Magellan science manager
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``The spacecraft is healthy except for this little problem, and
we can work around it,'' he added. ``Every indication is this will
have no effect on our operations.''
   Launched from the shuttle Atlantis in May 1989, Magellan is on a
mission to use radar to penetrate Venus' thick clouds and make the
best pictures and maps yet of the planet's rugged landscape.
   The spacecraft went into orbit around Venus on Friday after a
roundabout, 948-million-mile voyage to the second planet from the
sun.
   Lab spokesman Jim Doyle said the problem with the memory chip
should be corrected within a few days by bypassing the failed part.
   Computer commands are expected to turn on the spacecraft's radar
on Wednesday, then order Magellan to bounce radar off Venus in a
test on Thursday.
   That test and others the following week may produce
postage-stamp images of 15-by-15-mile squares of Venus' surface.
Those pictures will be released only if they reveal any interesting
discoveries, project manager Tony Spear said.
   Otherwise, NASA plans to issue Magellan's first official
pictures of Venus in September.
   Mapping of the planet could begin on Aug. 29, Thompson said.
   The chip failure happened in an onboard backup computer that can
accept commands from the spacecraft's main computers, then execute
those commands so the craft points properly toward Venus.
   Thompson said the faulty chip made the computer reject some
commands. But since it is a backup computer, those commands were
accepted and carried out by another computer, he added.
   Magellan orbits Venus once every 3 hours, 15{ minutes, Thompson
said. Its orbit ranges from 183 miles to 5,253 miles above Venus.

<HEAD>Senator: Flight Attendant Weight Standards Unfair to Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 40-year-old flight attendant shouldn't be
forced to starve herself into her 20-year-old size, says Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum, who's asking American Airlines to change its
weight policy.
   The policy is ``outdated and wrong,'' Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said
in a letter urging the Texas-based airline to scrap its weight
standard. The senator said the standard appears to be biased
against women, particularly older women.
   ``According to American's flight attendants, the standard is
applied in practice almost exclusively to the female attendants.
Certainly it has no application whatsoever to the pilots,
management or executive staff,'' Metzenbaum wrote.
   American Airlines President Robert Crandall has said weight
standards are necessary because ``we've got some people on our
airplanes that are way too heavy.''
   Company spokesman Al Becker said American has offered to
liberalize its weight standards but the attendants' union ``would
like for us to abandon weight standards altogether.''
   ``We are not prepared to do that,'' he said. ``Our flight
attendants are `public contact' employees.''
   The Association of Professional Flight Attendants, the union for
American's 16,000 attendants, is suing the company to challenge the
37-year-old weight guidelines, which were slightly modified after a
1975 court challenge.
   The trial is scheduled for 1991 in Fort Worth, Texas. The two
sides are scheduled to meet Aug. 22 in Fort Worth to discuss a
possible out-of-court settlement, company spokesman Ed Stewart said.
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has filed a federal
class-action suit in Los Angeles contending the policy
discriminates against women, and especially discriminates against
women over 40.
   According to Metzenbaum and EEOC lawyer Ralph D.H. Fertig,
American's policy requires ``a firm, trim silhouette, free of
bulges, rolls or paunches.''
   ``American still wants their flight attendants to appeal to a
male sexist notion of what is sexy,'' Fertig said.
   Pan American World Airways last year ended six years of
litigation by raising weight requirements and allowing an extra 9
pounds as attendants get older. The carrier also agreed to pay $2.3
million in lost wages to 115 employees who were not allowed to work
because of their weight.
   Northwest and Continental have dropped their weight
restrictions. Delta Airlines and USAir use less stringent weight
charts and provide leeway for older flight attendants.
   American's standards are roughly tied to a 1959 Metropolitan
Life Insurance Co. chart.
   A 5-foot-5-inch attendant may weight no more than 129 pounds at
American, but could weigh up to 138 at Delta, with 4 added pounds
as she ages; and up to 150 pounds at Pan Am, plus an extra 9 pounds
as she ages.
   Becker said American has offered to add allowances for age and
weight-loss leave as part of a weight proposal submitted to the
union in May. But he said he did not have details of the proposal.
   ``We believe we are being reasonable and realistic in this,'' he
said. ``What we want are a set of weight standards that make sense
and that project American in the proper light.''
   Metzenbaum urged American to follow the lead of the other
airlines and adopt ``fitness-based employee policies.''
   His letter pointed out that he heads the Senate Labor
Subcommittee, but did not threaten a formal investigation or
congressional hearing.
   Spokeswoman Nancy Coffey said Metzenbaum sent the letter Friday
to encourage American ``to become more modern,'' and further action
``would depend upon what American does.''
   Becker said he could not comment on the letter because American
had not yet received it.

<HEAD>Feared `Killer' Tomatoes Grown From Space Seeds Turning Out Tame</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The feared ``killer tomato'' seeds from outer
space are bearing a rather tame harvest.
   People have sampled the fruit of the seeds exposed to five years
more space radiation than planned. None turned into a space monster
_ or even got sick. Neither did a groundhog at Elmhurst College who
took a nibble.
   ``He's not glowing, I can tell you that,'' said Elmhurst biology
professor Frank Mittermeyer, one of about 58,000 teachers who
received some of the seeds.
   More than 12 million seeds were sent into orbit aboard a
satellite in 1984 to face deep-space radiation exposure for 10
months. But the 1986 Challenger disaster and other problems left
them aloft five years longer than planned.
   Astronauts retrieved the 11-ton Long Duration Exposure Facility
satellite in January, and the seeds were distributed to 4 million
students nationwide.
   A memo from a NASA contractor warned of a ``remote possibility''
that mutations in the seeds could produce toxic fruit, prompting
some teachers to abandon the program. The memo from Oklahoma State
University was not an official NASA statement, spokesmen said.
   About 6,000 participants have reported back to the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, program manager J. Gregory
Marlins said. So far, no one has grown a ``killer tomato.''
   Most have ignored NASA warnings not to eat the fruit. ``They're
eating them all over the country,'' Marlins said in a telephone
interview from Washington.
   ``In this first generation, there are very few mutations,'' he
said. ``But philosophically, we think it's not a good idea to eat
your science experiments.''
   Tomato plants belong to the nightshade family, which includes
such poisonous plants as the black nightshade, Marlins said. Some
scientists feared mutations could cause the tomatoes to become like
their poisonous relations.
   ``We've noticed that the colors were a little different, but
nothing yet that scares us, or makes us think they're monsters,''
Mittermeyer said. ``I'm really looking forward to eating the
tomatoes. I've been waiting six years.''
   Some of the tomatoes grown from the space seeds are darker than
those grown from normal seeds. And some of the plants have green,
yellow and white leaves, instead of normal green leaves, said Jim
Alston, a scientit with Park Seed Co., which distributed the seeds.
   The importance of those changes is not yet known, Alston said in
a telephone interview from Greenwood, S.C., where the company is
based.
   Many mutations won't become evident until the second generation
of space plants bears fruit, Marlins said. During the second
generation, mutations hidden in recessive genes may surface.
   Students and teachers involved in the program are scheduled to
return their reports to NASA by September, Marlins said. A final
report on the experiment is tentatively scheduled to be released in
December.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Is Congress a Step Ahead of Bush Foreign Policy?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barely 36 hours before Saddam Hussein's forces
swarmed into Kuwait, the State Department's top Middle East
official was telling Congress that its proposed sanctions on Iraq
were too harsh.
   The administration had sent its ambassador to speak to Saddam,
said assistant secretary John H. Kelly. ``We counseled restraint,''
he reassured a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee. Besides, the
administration already was planning to tighten export controls
``and they are working,'' he said.
   Few on Capitol Hill are claiming their sanctions would have
dissuaded Iraq's ambitious president from invading his oil-rich
neighbor. But there is a feeling that once again, Congress was a
step ahead of President Bush on an important facet of U.S. foreign
policy.
   ``In this instance, the Congress led the president,'' said Rep.
Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., the chairman of the Middle East subcommittee
where Kelly was testifying. ``A better posture would have been to
act earlier.''
   Nineteen months into his presidency, a well-defined pattern has
developed: Congress squawks about the U.S. stance in a regional
conflict, and the president, driven by criticism or by outside
forces, moves to accommodate.
   Having largely given in to congressional demands on Cambodia,
Nicaragua and El Salvador, and with Iraq policy changed overnight
by the invasion, the administration now is being confronted with
new appeals from Capitol Hill to wind down proxy wars against
communist governments in Afghanistan and Angola.
   ``This president is less fettered by convictions and less
willing to resist pressure than any since Nixon,'' said Michael
Mandlebaum, an analyst with the New York-based Council on Foreign
Relations.
   But administration defenders said the shifts result from a
changing world and Bush's desire for a bipartisan foreign policy,
not from a lack of backbone.
   ``You could butt heads, as happened during many years of the
Reagan administration, but I think that's been tried and found
wanting,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., a senior Foreign Affairs
Committee member who supported many of the policies that now are
being cast aside.
   Bush and his foreign policy team set the pattern early on, even
before he was inaugurated, by steering away from the Nicaragua
policy that had brought President Reagan into constant conflict
with Capitol Hill.
   In only a few months, Bush dropped aid to the Contra rebels _
which Reagan had created to fight the Soviet-backed Sandinista
government _ and quieted the longest-running policy fight of the
decade.
   In much the same way, Bush's policy-makers at the State
Department now are negotiating a new bipartisan approach to El
Salvador, bowing to congressional insistence that restrictions be
placed on military aid to the rightist government that Reagan had
supported unconditionally.
   The Cambodia decision seemed to come from the same mold.
Lawmakers had complained increasingly about U.S. support for a
coalition of forces opposing the communist government, because the
coalition includes the murderous Khmer Rouge.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III announced that the United
States would withdraw its support for a United Nations seat for the
coalition and would open talks with Vietnam, which installed the
current government. Some in Congress believe those moves don't go
far enough, and expect further concessions.
   Still other Third World conflicts could be the subject of change
prompted by the legislative branch. Changes in U.S. support for
Angolan rebels are reported to be in the works, and the Senate has
approved an intelligence bill that sources say slashes by one-third
the covert U.S. aid given Afghanistan's mujahedeen rebels and
eliminates the covert aid program to Cambodia's rebel coalition.
   In each case, U.S. aid to anti-government rebels has been a sore
point for members of Congress, and the administration's flexibility
has been increased because the Soviets have eased their own support
for the current government.
   ``This is a highly pragmatic administration, and it sees that
the death of communism can facilitate the death of
anti-communism,'' said Robert Hunter, an analyst at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
   Bush now can ``indulge a lot of this congressional vision
without paying heavy penalties,'' Hunter said.
   The administration's flexibility is limited, and the most
visible example is U.S. policy toward China. Bush, who claims
personal expertise on the world's most populous country, has
resisted efforts to punish Beijing for last year's crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement, drawing criticism from Congress.
   And when change does come, the impetus is not solely from
Capitol Hill.
   ``Each of these already was up on the list of issues that needed
to be re-examined,'' said a senior State Department official who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Step by step, the president and
the secretary of state have gone through and said it's time for a
change.''

<HEAD>EDITOR'S NOTE: The following dispatch from the national media pool
was filed by John King of The Associated Press. The pool stopped at
the Central Command headquarters Sunday en route to the U.S.
deployment in Saudi Arabia.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   MACDILL AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. _ The commander of the U.S.
military effort in the Middle East said Sunday the deployment of
American forces is running ahead of schedule and that Iraq would
``pay a price'' if it attacked Saudi Arabia.
   But Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the United States
Central Command, said the Iraqis were continuing to move
reinforcements into Kuwait. Those forces were taking up defensive
positions and some were ``right down literally on'' the
Kuwait-Saudi border, he said.
   Schwarzkopf said that the Iraqi troops had taken a similar
defensive posture before invading Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``There's no question about the fact that they have dug in right
now for a strong defense,'' the general said. But he added: ``They
have the capability to do just about anything they want to.'' Of
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, Schwarzkopf said: ``It is very, very
difficult to predict the man's intentions.''
   Schwarzkopf showed reporters being taken to Saudi Arabia the war
room at the Central Command headquarters at MacDill, located in
Tampa. From his command desk, Schwarzkopf said he had instant
communications with Defense Secretary Richard Cheney, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Colin Powell and virtually every
other military commander around the world.
   Behind Schwarzkopf were two tiers of desks staffed by command
directors representing all of the U.S. armed forces. The generals
and colonels faced a display of six digital clocks and screens that
showed current deployments, pending actions, force dispositions and
current intelligence on the Persian Gulf situation.
   ``There's a constant flow of information in and out of here,''
Schwarzkopf said.
   He also said the flow of troops and materiel to Saudi Arabia was
ahead of schedule and had gone exceptionally smoothly.
   ``I would never tell you that the American forces that are there
are 100 percent out of harm's way,'' Schwarzkopf said. But, he
said, ``We have built up a great deal of force over there now ...
and if they do make an attack they are going to pay a price for
it.''
   The American ground forces are outnumbered now, but Schwarzkopf
said he was confident American air and naval power could neutralize
any Iraqi attack.
   He said the Saudi military would command the burgeoning Arab
military presence in Saudi Arabia.
   ``The Saudis have made it clear that they are going to command
the Arab forces,'' he said.
   ``We're deeply involved in working that out now,'' he said of
coordination among commanders of the various multinational forces.
   An important goal of those talks, he said, was to prevent
side-by-side deployment of troops from different nations at key
strategic points because of language barriers and other
communications problems.
   ``An old adage is, never draw a (command) boundary through a
piece of critical terrain,'' Schwarzkopf said. Pentagon officials
have said Saddam has just two direct routes into Saudi Arabia from
Kuwait should he decide to attack; one along the coast, the other
further north near Saudi oil fields.
   Schwarzkopf said military commanders would avoid allowing such
``seams'' between forces of different nationalities to occur at
critical locations.
   Schwarzkopf opened his briefing by describing the logistical
challenge of transporting U.S. troops and equipment to the Middle
East, 7,000 miles by air and 12,000 miles by sea from the East
Coast.
   Airlifting one heavy division would take 1,538 loads aboard a
C-141 transport and another 269 loads aboard a C-5 transport, the
largest aircraft in the world. For that reason, he said a lot of
equipment was being shipped by sea.
   ``The magnitude of this task, to quote my teen-agers, is
`totally awesome','' Schwarzkopf said.
   Asked whether he believed Saddam's call for resistance in the
Arab world would prompt Iraqi-sponsored terrorism, Schwarzkopf
said: ``There are several terrorist organizations that have found
haven in Iraq and I have every expectation that they're going to be
asked to do something. We're paying attention.''
   But he said it was important to emphasize that the other
governments in the area recognize Saddam is a threat to them as
well as the United States and that their resistance to Iraq would
not be easily shaken.
   He said a small resistance movement continued in Kuwait but that
it was not nearly powerful enough to have an impact on the Iraqi
occupation. Still, he said it was an important symbol.
   ``Right now Kuwait as I knew it is essentially gone,'' he said.
   Schwarzkopf said he was confident U.S. troops could perform well
in the desert climate even if Saddam unleashed his arsenal of
chemical weapons.
   ``It's tough, sure, but it's not impossible. It's nowhere near
impossible.''
   Asked whether he expected a chemical attack, Schwarzkopf
said:``Given their record in the Iran-Iraq war I would never
discount that possibility ... We're prepared for everything.''
   He said Iraq has been calling up reserves but that its best
troops were those that invaded Kuwait and are still there.
   Schwarzkopf was in Saudi Arabia last week with Cheney but since
then had been directing the U.S. military response from the Florida
base, with a deputy command center based in Saudi Arabia. But he
said the main headquarters would soon be set up in Saudi Arabia and
that he personally was going.

<HEAD>Children of Divorce Risk More Illness, Study Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children of divorced or separated parents run
a greater risk of becoming ill than those who grow up in
traditional nuclear families, a study concludes.
   Researcher Jane Mauldon of the University of California at
Berkeley said children of broken families run a 35 percent risk of
developing health problems over a three-year period. That compares
with a 26 percent risk among all children.
   Tonsillitis, repeated ear infections and pneumonia accounted for
nearly one-third of the reported illnesses, according to the study.
Other problems included allergies, asthma, chronic skin conditions,
chronic lung problems and urinary infections.
   The problems persist even after the mother has remarried, the
report also noted.
   The results of the study appear in the August edition of the
journal Demographics, published by the Washington-based Population
Association of America.
   Mauldon wrote that the ``children are likely to have experienced
very significant stress because their living standards changed
dramatically.''
   ``They probably also lost many of the resources that contribute
to good health _ a safe, comfortable environment relatively free of
environmental hazards and risks of infection, good food, and
constant adult supervision,'' she wrote.
   With the father gone and many mothers needing to find work after
divorce, children have less contact with their parents, Mauldon
observed. Mothers generally have custody of children after divorce.
   Divorce can reduce the availability of health insurance for some
children, although those who are in the lowest income group may
become eligible for Medicaid.
   Mauldon, of the Graduate School of Public Policy at Berkeley,
studied 6,000 children's health histories. In families where a
divorce occurs, children average 0.13 more illnesses per year after
their parents' divorce than before, Mauldon concluded.
   Not only were children of broken families more likely to develop
health problems than those in intact families, but the problems
also persisted even when the mother remarried, Mauldon reported.
   ``If post-divorce health problems spring from emotional
difficulties, then we should see more illness in the first year or
two after separation, when children are most upset,'' she reported.
   However, she found that while the risk of health problems is
higher than average for children in the first four years after a
family separation, it increases even more after that, Mauldon said.
   Her study was published just days after a Census Bureau study
showing that divorced mothers receive only about 70 percent of the
child support payments they are due.
   That report said that as of the spring of 1988 there were 9.4
million mothers caring for children on their own.
   Only about 59 percent had been awarded child support payments,
the Bureau found, averaging $2,710 annually.
   Only about half received the full amount, however, and one-third
of mothers raising children on their own were listed as below the
poverty level.
   Mauldon said it is possible that divorced mothers are more
likely to report their children's illnesses than mothers in intact
families. But she concluded that this is unlikely to account for
the overall differences in rates of illness.

   A group calling itself the Palestinian
Revolutionary Squads said Monday it has released a second Swiss
hostage, a relief worker for the International Committee of the Red
Cross.
   A statement from the group said orthopedic expert Elio Erriquez,
24, was freed after more than 10 months in captivity ``to complete
the initiative for resolving the case of the Swiss hostages.''
   But the message, delivered to a Western news agency early Monday
along with a black-and-white picture of Erriquez, did not say where
and how Erriquez was released or give any information on his
whereabouts.
   In Geneva, neither the Swiss Foreign Ministry nor the Red Cross
could confirm Erriquez's release.
   The first Swiss captive, Emanuel Christen, 33, was released by
the same group on Wednesday. Both hostages were working with a Red
Cross clinic near Sidon when they were kidnapped.
   Christen was handed to the command of Syrian peacekeeping troops
in Lebanon, which delivered him to the Swiss Embassy in the Syrian
capital of Damascus. He flew home on Thursday.
   Monday's statement said the Swiss hostages were freed in
response to efforts by Syrian president Hafez Assad, Algerian
President Chadli Bendjedid, and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   The photograph of Erriquez showed him clean-shaven and wearing a
white T-shirt.
   Erriquez and Christen were kidnapped Oct. 6 by masked gunmen
near a Red Cross center for artificial limbs in Sidon, provincial
capital of South Lebanon, 40 miles south of Beirut.
   Police blamed the abduction on Fatah-Revolutionary Council, a
radical guerrilla group led by Palestinian terrorist mastermind Abu
Nidal. The group had disclaimed any involvment in the affair.
   The Palestinian Revolutionary Squad said in Monday's statement
that it has no connections with Abu Nidal's group or any other
Palestinian guerrilla faction.
   The statement paid ``particular tribute to Mustafa Saad for
efficient role to ensure a success'' of the latest release. Saad
heads a leftist Sunni Moslem militia that has governed Sidon since
the outbreak of Lebanon's civil war in 1975.
   Saad told reporters Saturday that Erriquez would be freed soon.
The latest release would leave 14 Westerners hostage in Lebanon.
   They are six Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, an
Irishman and an Italian. Longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East Correspondent for The Associated Press. Anderson was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   The first U.S. journalists are being allowed
to travel to Saudi Arabia since American troops arrived in the
Persian Gulf nation to protect it from a possible Iraqi invasion.
   The Washington-based reporters were scheduled to arrive in Saudi
Arabia today aboard an Air Force cargo plane. Before leaving the
United States on Sunday, they were briefed by Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf, commander of the United States Central Command, at
MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa, Fla.
   Journalists had protested to the Pentagon that U.S. troops had
arrived in Saudi Arabia, but no American reporters were allowed
into the country to cover their activities. Defense Department
officials had promised to work on the matter.
   Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug. 2, then moved toward that country's
border with Saudi Arabia. On Aug. 7, the United States dispatched
troops to Saudi Arabia to defend the oil-rich kingdom against a
possible Iraqi incursion. But no American reporters had been
allowed to view the situation.
   U.S. officials had said it was Saudi officials who established
the ground rules that kept journalists from the United States out
of the kingdom.
   When U.S. forces invaded Panama last December, a small group of
American journalists accompanied the troops. The reporters were
selected in advance by their employers and pledged to keep their
movement secret to protect the security of the military operation.
   But journalists complained that the Pentagon pool did not work
in Panama, where reporters were kept away from the action.
   The arrangement was set up after the U.S. invasion of Grenada,
when journalists were kept away from the Caribbean nation entirely.
   Journalists from The Associated Press, Reuters, United Press
International, Scripps-Howard News Service, Cable News Network,
National Public Radio, the Milwaukee Journal, the Los Angeles Times
and Time Magazine are in the pool.

   The 50th Black Hills Motor Classic, which
lured 300,000 bikers to this town of 7,000, had everything people
here had come to expect from a motorcycle rally: choppers, tattoos,
leather _ and violence.
   Eleven people died, one man was shot and two others were stabbed
in a bar brawl between motorcycle gangs, and hundreds were arrested
during the weeklong event.
   ``As I've said before, the potential is there,'' said Sheriff
Floyd Cleland. ``These people all drink booze, take drugs and carry
knives and guns.''
   Law officers shot to death a knife-wielding Australian who
charged them, and another person died of carbon monoxide poisoning
in a tent. The nine other deaths came in crashes.
   Marcy Myhre, executive director of the Sturgis Area Chamber of
Commerce's Black Hills Motor Classic Board, had predicted last fall
that this year's event could draw more than 250,000 people. Last
year's rally drew only 60,000, but officials estimated that at
least 300,000 showed up during the past week.
   ``I think that's kind of conservative,'' Myhre said of the
official estimate.
   Long lines of motorcycles roared out of town Sunday. Bill
Kienast of Oshkosh, Wis., said he was attending his first rally
here and would probably return despite the bloody bar brawl.
   ``With this amount of people, you know there's going to be
things happen. There's going to be accidents. There's going to be
fights,'' Kienast said.
   Myhre acknowledged that some Sturgis residents were bothered by
the huge crowds and violence. ``A lot of them feel it was a little
too much, but a lot of them realize this is a once-in-a-lifetime
crowd, too,'' she said.
   Law officers had made 202 drunken driving arrests and 73 drug
arrests by Sunday. There were 133 reported traffic collisions, 78
involving injuries. Officers issued 1,060 traffic tickets and 2,143
warnings.
   The bar brawl at Gunner's Lounge and Casino Saturday night
erupted between rival from the Outlaws and Sons of Silence
motorcycle gangs, he said.
   Aggravated assault charges will be filed against two Sons of
Silence gang members who were hospitalized in serious condition
with stab wounds, authorities said. An Outlaws gang member who was
shot in the neck was allowed to travel home to Atlanta on Sunday
and was not immediately charged.
   Sturgis residents Ken and Barb Grosch were on Main Street on
Saturday night with their video camera to record the procession of
bikes and bikers.
   ``It's nice to see a small, boring town come alive,'' said Mrs.
Grosch. ``I think it's great, but after a week or so I'm ready to
see them go home.''

<HEAD>Babies Already Learning About Language Before Born, Studies Suggest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Yuppie mothers-to-be who try to put their children
on the fast track by talking to them in the womb may be on the
right track.
   Studies have found that starting in the womb, babies recognize
speech as a special sound and distinguish between spoken passages,
Anthony DeCasper, a psychology professor at the University North
Carolina at Greensboro, said Sunday.
   DeCasper described research involving a group of women who were
in their 32nd week of pregnancy. Researchers asked the women to
recite a particular paragraph of a children's story three times in
a row each day until the birth.
   Three different passages were used, but each mother recited only
one.
   About 52 hours after birth, the babies were given a special
nipple and earphones. By altering their rate of sucking, they could
choose to hear a woman reciting either the story their mothers had
recited, or one of the other stories.
   They chose the familiar story, DeCasper said.
   ``We're talking about recognition of linguistically relevant
speech sounds,'' he said. ``The implication is that fetuses heard,
perceived, listened and learned about something about the acoustic
structure of American English.''
   In another study, 24 newborns were exposed to the sound of a
heartbeat or a woman speaking, DeCasper said. They were able to
choose which ear would hear the sound by varying the frequency at
which they sucked a pacifier.
   Babies chose to hear speech in the right ear and the heartbeat
in the left ear, said DeCasper. So they were already processing
speech differently from other sound, he said.
   ``What it shows is, at birth, there is some `knowledge' of the
language of the culture,'' said DeCasper, who spoke in a
presentation and an interview at the annual meeting of the American
Psychological Association.
   Mriganka Sur, of the department of brain and cognitive science
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the idea that
the result shows specialized processing of speech sounds ``makes a
lot of sense to me.''
   It reflects specialization in the brain's two halves, called
hemispheres, he said. That probably is driven by genes, although
the experience of hearing speech before birth may also play a role,
he said.

   A career military man from California who the
Pentagon said was accidentally hit by a truck in Saudi Arabia has
become the first American soldier to die in the U.S. buildup in the
Middle East.
   John Campisi, a 30-year-old Air Force staff sergeant and father
of four from Covina, Calif., died Sunday during troop preparations.
Campisi, who had been in the military since he was 18, was assigned
to Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska.
   ``It will be very hard on those children,'' Campisi's father,
Salvatore Campisi, said. ``Anything he could do with his children
he did with them.''
   ``The main thing is that he was a wonderful father,'' his
mother, Marge Campisi, said in a telephone interview. ``He was
involved in everything with those kids _ scout leader, religious
classes. He always made time for his family.''
   The elder Campisi described his son as having ``the patience of
Job.'' The elder Campisi said his oldest child was ``a good kid ...
committed to the Air Force.'' Salvatore Campisi had carved his own
career with the Navy.
   A Pentagon preliminary investigation indicated Campisi was hit
by a truck on a dark runway. Pentagon sources speaking on condition
of anonymity said he may have been wearing ear coverings that
hindered his ability to hear.
   Pentagon spokesman Major Doug Hart said the accident is under
investigation.
   Besides a wife of 11 years and two sons and two daughters,
Campisi leaves three brothers and a sister. Two brothers are in the
Navy. ``One of them just got back last week or he would have gone
too,'' Campisi's mother said.
   Campisi grew up in West Covina, about 20 miles from downtown Los
Angeles, and attended Edgewood High School, where his favorite
sports were baseball and wrestling.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   Saddam Hussein's conquest of Kuwait and
threats against Saudi Arabia have sharpened the inter-Arab
rivalries that have long thwarted hopes of forging a regional unity
against Israel.
   The failure of the Arabs to move against Saddam for gobbling up
a fellow Arab state has underlined their inherent inability to take
decisive, collective action. But the debate over the Iraqi
president's action still rings with appeals to pan-Arab concerns,
including declarations by the Saddam himself.
   The various Arab factions all condemned Israel's seizure of Arab
lands in 1967, and Saddam declared Sunday he was ready to resolve
the Persian Gulf crisis if Israel gave up those conquests.
   It was Saddam's own attempt to use one of the few issues that
all Arabs agree on to stir up pan-Arab support for his cause.
   Most Arab nations may have objected to Saddam's predatory
invasion Aug. 2, but they split cleanly over what to do about it.
Only a few have sent small military forces to help defend Saudi
Arabia, the Arab world's bankroller.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia had no choice but to call in the
Americans to defend his throne against a brother Arab because no
one else was prepared to do it.
   The Arab League, now with 21 members, was founded in 1945 to
unite the Arab world as the colonial era ended after World War II.
   But in a region riven by centuries-old tribal feuds, overlaid
with the political and territorial confrontations spawned in the
postwar era, that unity has proved to be as elusive as a desert
mirage.
   Gen. Saad el-Shazly, a hero in the Arab world for masterminding
the 1973 Egyptian assault across the Suez Canal that sent the
Israelis reeling, noted in his book ``The Arab Military Option,''
that ``the Arab world is a mosaic.
   ``Seen from afar it looks whole, but examined closely it reveals
itself no more than a pattern of glinting, multicolored fragments.
The bleak but inexorable verdict has to be that it is impossible to
see how Arab unity can be achieved in the foreseeable future.''
   He stresses that ``three diseases ravage the Arab world,
debilitating its potential strength'' _ rival ideologies, uneven
economic wealth and the conflicting ambitions of its leaders.
   The Arab world stretches from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic,
from the Mediterranean to the Congo. Its 210 million people share a
common religion, Islam.
   All speak Arabic, but traditions and custom vary so much that an
Algerian Arab is virtually incomprehensible to a Levantine Arab
from Lebanon.
   The creation of Israel in 1948 in what was once Palestine
should, in theory, have been the catalyst for bringing the
fledgling Arabs states together. But it did not _ and to this day
still has not.
   One reason why the combined Arab armies of Syria, Jordan, Iraq,
Lebanon and Egypt failed to crush the heavily outnumbered Israelis
in the first Middle East war of 1948-49 was that national
jealousies prevented the creation of a unified Arab command.
   That remains true now, three unsuccessful wars with the Jewish
state later.
   All attempts at political union by some countries, such as Egypt
and Syria, have failed because of conflicting objectives.
   No two Arab regimes are the same.
   The rivalries stemmed in large part from the arbitrary and often
artificial borders drawn for many of these states by the British
and French after World War I when they carved up the old Ottoman
Empire.
   With Iraq's annexation of Kuwait, which was ruled by an emir,
there are now seven monarchies, most of them absolute, like Saudi
Arabia.
   Seven states have thinly veiled military or military-backed
dictatorships, such as Iraq, Syria and Libya. The others are either
one-party republics or emerging democracies.
   Iraq and Syria, ruled by rival wings of the Baath Arab Socialist
Party, have been feuding for more than 10 years and have backed
different sides in Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war.
   Algeria and Morocco are at odds over the mineral-rich Western
Sahara.
   Syrian President Hafez Assad has been scrapping with PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat since 1983.
   Syria ended an 11-year rift with Egypt in December. Syria broke
off relations with Cairo in 1978 after Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat signed a peace treaty with Israel.
   Amid these frustrations, many Arab states have settled for
forming sub-regional economic and security alliances, a move that
some analysts see as evidence of a new pragmatism in the Arab world.
   The Gulf Cooperation Council was founded in 1981, while the
Iran-Iraq war raged, and includes Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United
Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and what was then the independent
emirate of Kuwait.
   In February 1989, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and North Yemen _ now
united with South Yemen _ formed the Arab Cooperation Council,
while Libya, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and Mauretania joined
together in the Arab Maghreb Union.
   Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2 and his massing of
tens of thousands of troops on Saudi Arabia's northern border was a
body blow to the Gulf Cooperation Council, which despite its
joint-security agreement failed to rally behind Kuwait.
   Saddam's action was also a slap in the face for Egypt, its Arab
Cooperation Council partner and a leading Arab moderate which had
tried to head off the Iraqi invasion.
   At an emergency Arab summit in Cairo on Friday, Egypt was one of
only 12 Arab states that voted for a resolution on sending troops
to Saudi Arabia.
   Economically, there are also great imbalances in the Arab world
which have exacerbated the lack of unity.
   The oil-rich gulf states long reveled in their petro-dollar
wealth while millions of fellow Arabs have languished in poverty,
their countries burdened by mountainous debts.
   Sadat's successor, Hosni Mubarak, has skillfully guided Egypt
back into the Arab fold after a decade of ostracism by the Arabs
and clearly hoped to become the beacon for moderate forces in this
turbulent region.
   His strategy appeared to be making headway until Saddam, his
regional ambitions fueled by his self-proclaimed ``victory'' in the
1980-88 war against Iran, went on the warpath and shifted the
center of Arab gravity from Cairo to Baghdad.

   The historic heart of the old czarist
capital is crumbling and can be saved only by giving it to the
people who live there, says a young archaeologist who has become an
influential politician.
   For Alexei Kovalyov, one of the gems of European culture is the
prize to be won or lost by an experiment in market economics and
individual responsibility.
   Piles of dirt and debris lie in Peace Square, once a beauty spot
of the city. The broad Corinthian columns of the Kazan Cathedral
are disintegrating.
   Majestic structures associated with Peter the Great,
Dostoyevsky, Pushkin and Tchaikovsky sag in dirt and decay.
   About 5,000 historic buildings dating from the time when
Leningrad was St. Petersburg are under official protection, but
that has little practical meaning because there has been no attempt
at maintenance.
   ``The condition of the city is catastrophic, and this applies
not only to its architectural monuments, but to all of its
buildings,'' said Kovalyov, 26, an intense man who began his
campaign to save Leningrad in 1986, when he was an archaeology
student.
   He now is chairman both of the city council committee on
historic preservation and one of the council factions. Like most
other public issues in the era of glasnost, his effort has become
intensely political.
   ``We usually say we don't have the money, we don't have the
materials, we don't have the working hands we need,'' Kovalyov said
of the reconstruction effort. ``That's all an illusion. If we had
normal economic relations, we would all of a sudden have the money,
the material, the working hands.''
   Since all buildings are public property under the Soviet system,
the occupants do not care about them, he said in the Marinsky
Palace, city council headquarters.
   Most people who live in a historic but run-down building in the
center of Leningrad jump at the chance to move to a new,
prefabricated apartment on the outskirts.
   ``The preservation of our city is possible only in one instance:
if we now start to transfer homes to individual owners,'' Kovalyov
said. ``These owners can be private, cooperatives ... every form of
ownership permitted in other countries of the world.''
   Similar plans are under way in Moscow. Both cities elected
reform mayors this year and the two officials, Leningrad lawyer
Anatoly Sobchak and Moscow economist Gavriil Popov, quit the
Communist Party in July.
   Although the means are the same, Moscow's purpose is different:
to start a housing market that might spur construction and end the
chronic shortage of living quarters.
   Alexander Osovtsov, chairman of the Moscow council's commission
on social policy, told the weekly Moscow News in July the city
would start giving apartments to their residents beginning in early
1991.
   Residents with more than the officially allotted space per
person, about 130 square feet, will have to buy the excess from the
Moscow city government. Those with less will get certificates
entitling them to new and larger housing.
   Moscow residents say advertisements from potential buyers
already are appearing on the streets.
   In Leningrad, as in Moscow, the issue is part of a broader
effort to eliminate the legacy of Soviet rule. Leningrad seeks a
special status that could permit it to offer tax holidays, give
free rein to entrepreneurs, boost tourism and possibly issue its
own currency.
   Kovalyov and his supporters say their city of 5 million has more
to preserve than Moscow or most other European capitals because
there never has been enough money to modernize it.
   Many downtown buildings date from the time when the city
sparkled as an imperial capital.
   Palaces and parks dot the central district. There is little
traffic on Nevsky Prospekt, the main street that leads from the
Alexander Nevsky Monastery, where luminaries of science, literature
and music are buried, to the majesty of the Hermitage and the gold
spire of the Admiralty.
   ``Of all the European capitals, Petersburg is the most preserved
city of all,'' Kovalyov said. ``If we take London or Paris, there
reconstruction was much more serious.''
   Saving the city must go beyond protecting the most famous sites
that attract thousands of tourists yearly, he said.
   ``For us, it's most important to preserve the city environment,
all the way to saving every house, each structure, every gate and
bracket,'' Kovalyov declared.
   He said Leningrad's current state is tied to its namesake,
Vladimir I. Lenin, and the communist system he built.
   The city was known as St. Petersburg for more than 200 years
after Peter the Great founded it as his capital. Then, to remove
the name's Germanic flavor, it was rechristened Petrograd during
World War I.
   It was named Leningrad in 1924, after Lenin's death.
   Whether to resume the old name is being discussed on the streets
and in the city council.
   Many other cities are demanding, and getting, their old names
back, but changing Leningrad to St. Petersburg is of special
significance in a country whose founder has been venerated for
decades.
   Skirmishes already have occurred in the council chamber on the
sensitive topic of renaming landmarks associated with Lenin.
   Last spring, the council took up a proposal to rename the square
in front of the Smolny Institute, Lenin's revolutionary
headquarters, but referred it to a committee.
   It now is called Dictatorship of the Proletariat Square and the
proposal is to name it for Andrei Sakharov, the nuclear physicist
and human rights activist who died in December.
   Kovalyov said Leningrad is an appropriate name if the city
continues to deteriorate, but ``if the conditions of the city's
existence change, then the overwhelming majority of residents will
understand the need to rename it.''

   Westerners' nightmares of long lines at
the gas station and higher fuel prices because of the Persian Gulf
crisis are already a reality in Eastern Europe.
   The visions last fall of new freedoms and better standards of
living as first one former Soviet bloc nation and then another
ousted its Communist rulers are increasingly blurred by economic
difficulties.
   And the dramatic increase in oil prices since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait is not likely to help East European countries
implement planned market reforms.
   In contrast, however, the Soviet Union, the world's largest oil
producer, stands to gain from the Middle East crisis.
   ``We can gain several billion dollars,'' Alexei M. Vasiliev,
deputy director of the African Institute in Moscow, told Soviet
television on Thursday. ``This is a breath of fresh air for our
ruined economy.''
   The Iraqi attack on its oil-rich neighbor darkened hopes that
the difficult transition to a market economy would quickly mean a
better standard of living.
   ``I would rather have gas prices go up than the cost of bread,''
said Julia Buda, a 40-year-old Budapest translator. ``But I fear
both, along with everything else, will be going up.''
   The Soviet Union dealt the first blow when earlier this summer
it cut oil exports to East European countries by up to 30 percent.
According to a CIA report, Soviet oil production has fallen in
recent months because of aging oil fields, and labor and ethnic
unrest.
   The newly democratic governments in Eastern Europe raised
gasoline prices by up to 50 percent to try to cut consumption.
Citizens resorted to panic buying, waiting up to 10 hours to fill
their tanks.
   In Czechoslovakia, some people have started storing gasoline in
bath tubs. But Eastern Europe is likely to feel the effects of the
Persian Gulf crisis hardest in 1991. Beginning next Jan. 1, the
countries grouped in the Soviet-led trading bloc Comecon will trade
in hard currency at world prices.
   Eastern Europe faces the additional burden of the large export
credits the region granted to Iraq for investment projects. It also
faces unpaid bills for weapons and other products sold to Iraq.
   Adherence to the worldwide embargo against Baghdad ``will even
more complicate the current situation,'' said Peter Havlik of the
Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies.
   Iraq owes Poland, for example, more than $500 million for
weapons and other military supplies. Part of the debt was to be
paid with oil.
   Hungary has already begun purchasing oil from Libya and Algeria
to offset the Soviet reductions of some 30 percent. But the
country, strapped with a foreign debt of nearly $20 billion, has to
pay dollars for those imports.
   Havlik said Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Bulgaria were
likely to be hardest hit, because they rely almost exclusively on

<HEAD>Briton Dead In Exodus From Kuwait</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WRIGHT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Foreigners have fled Iraq and Kuwait despite the Baghdad
government's attempt to close the borders, but one attempt at
escape ended in death for a British businessman.
   The British government said Sunday Iraqi troops shot and killed
the man as he tried to flee to Saudi Arabia from Kuwait. It was the
first official report of a Westerner killed by Iraqi troops in
Kuwait since Iraq invaded Aug. 2.
   ``This is a barbaric crime,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.
   The report came as scores of foreigners were returning to their
homelands Sunday with stories of rapes and other abuses by Iraqi
soldiers in the emirate that Iraq overran 11 days ago.
   But others said the Iraqi forces appeared well disciplined and
said no widespread destruction was apparent in the small Persian
Gulf nation, though food supplies were dwindling.
   Among recent departures, 90 Filpinos arrived in Manila on
Sunday, bringing to 263 the number of people who have returned to
the Philipines, officials said. Seven Koreans arrived in Amman,
Jordan from Baghdad on Sunday.
   In Iraq, a government spokesman quoted by Baghdad radio said the
authorities have been instructed to ``facilitate the travel of the
Arabs and foreign residents in Kuwait and other cities of southern
Iraq.''
   It was not clear whether the spokesman meant foreigners in
Kuwait could leave the country. Some foreigners were taken from
Kuwait to Baghdad in the aftermath of the Iraqi invasion.
   In London, the Foreign Office identified the slain businessman
as Douglas Thomas Croskery of northeastern England. A source close
to the family told Sky news television that Croskery, who managed a
printing company, was shot Saturday.
   Britain said Croskery's death ``must be construed as murder''
and called on Iraq to punish the culprits, whose actions had
flouted international law, the spokesman said.
   Kuwait's ambassador to Britain, Ghazi al-Rayes, said he was
told, by sources he did not identify, that Croskery was in a two-or
three-car convoy detained by Iraqi troops.
   ``The second (car), they stopped and immediately they shot this
man. They asked the others to leave the car and go walking to the
border, which was about three miles'' away, the ambassador told Sky
Television news.
   Many foreigners told of dramatic escapes to freedom.
   John Norman, an accountant from Raleigh, N.C., working in
Kuwait, said he rode a taxi for five hours across the Iraqi desert,
chain-smoking cigarettes and nibbling on hard-boiled eggs as the
cab bounced toward Jordan.
   At the border checkpoint, Norman said, Iraqi soldiers began
firing their automatic weapons after a broadcast speech by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
   ``It was an escape,'' Norman told The Charlotte Observer
Saturday. ``It wasn't a walk through. I didn't know whether I was
going to leave Iraq alive.''
   He returned to North Carolina on Friday, ending an odyssey that
in three days took him by cab, private car and jumbo jet from
Baghdad to Amman, Jordan, to London and then to Raleigh.
   Norman was scheduled to leave Kuwait on a monthlong vacation
Aug. 2, the day Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Adrian King, who was among those returning to Britain on Sunday,
said he had heard a burst of machine-gun fire as the Britons made
their escape.
   King's wife, Anne, said her German neighbor was raped by an
Iraqi soldier.
   ``The soldier had tied the husband up, raped his wife and then
made them sit down and have a cup of tea,'' Mrs. King said.
   But Daryl Holt, who fled to Saudi Arabia with his daughters
Michelle, 10, Amanda, 6, and Caroline, 4, said he encountered no
serious problems in Kuwait city ``apart for the soldiers being
there.''
   ``We were not threatened by them. In fact they were very
courteous,'' said Holt, a banker who has lived in Kuwait for 15
years. He spoke on arrival at Heathrow airport.
   The newspaper Gulf Daily News reported Sunday that one group of
32 escapees included Britons, Americans, Irish, one Singaporean and
one Filipino. There were 11 women and seven children among them.

<TEXT>
   The honeymoon was short, but at least there
was a wedding for Angie Nelson and her sweetheart, a soldier bound
for the Middle East.
   ``I'm a married woman,'' Angie Ohmer, 19, announced Sunday
afternoon as she stepped off a private jet returning her from her
hastily arranged wedding at Fort Bragg, N.C., to Pfc. Mark Ohmer of
Walled Lake.
   The couple planned to marry Saturday afternoon in Walled Lake,
but Iraq's invasion of Kuwait forced Mark Ohmer, 20, to return to
his unit, the 82nd Airborne.
   The wedding went on anyway _ six hours later than scheduled and
about 1,000 miles from Walled Lake.
   The couple got help from Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who arranged
for a Michigan businessman to donate use of his jet to take the
bride and her family to North Carolina.
   After a one-night honeymoon, Mrs. Ohmer's new husband was back
with his unit, awaiting orders to ship out.
   ``It seems like all we ever do is say goodbye,'' Mrs. Ohmer
said. ``But it's good to be married.''
   The couple had planned to live in North Carolina, where Mrs.
Ohmer hoped to take college classes. Now, with her husband's unit
leaving, she said she will register for classes in Michigan.
   ``I'm going to try and find a job and keep really, really
busy,'' she said. ``I didn't think about any of the bad stuff, but
I'll probably start thinking about it when I get home.''

<HEAD>Death Toll Rises to 173 in Tamil Attack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ERAVUR, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White flags of mourning today fluttered
above Moslem homes in five fishing villages where Tamil gumnen
massacred 173 residents with machine gunfire and machetes.
   Military officials raised the death toll as families brought in
more bodies from the stricken villages after the Saturday night
massacre.
   It was one of the worst eruptions of violence in this island
nation's escalating ethnic conflict, which pits Tamil separatists
against the Sinhalese-dominated government.
   Although Moslems claim neutrality in the 7-year-old civil war,
the government says Tamils suspect them of siding with the army.
   Elsewhere in Sri Lanka, military officials said rebels suspected
of being Tamils ambushed a truck in the northeastern Trincomalee
district at dawn today and killed 15 Sinhalese.
   On Sunday, at least 15 Tamil Tiger rebels, four Moslems and six
government soldiers were killed in separate incidents.
   A Tamil politician said Saturday's attack on Moslem villages was
in retaliation for the killing of 33 Tamil villagers by Moslems
earlier the same day. The People's Front of Liberation Tigers, the
main Tamil rebel group, denied involvement in the massacre.
   At least 538 people have been killed on Sri Lanka's east coast
in the past 10 days. The victims include 363 Moslems, 100 Tamils
and 75 Sinhalese, military officials and politicians say.
   In Eravur, tension lingered as the military lifted an overnight
curfew and stepped up patrols. Victims were given a mass burial.
   Brigadier Upali Seneviratne, the top army officer in the eastern
province, said at least 40 Tamil gunmen attacked the villages.
   ``They broke into three groups and shot at everybody in sight,''
he said. He said the dead included 29 women and 31 children, one of
whom was a 9-day-old girl.
   After a 90-minute raid on Eravur, the gunmen moved to adjacent
villages, the officials said. The villages are clustered on the
east coast, 125 miles east of Colombo.
   On Aug. 3, gunmen raided another eastern village and massacred
140 Moslems in two mosques. The incident set off a chain of
vengeance killings.
   On Sunday, Sri Lankan police shot and killed 15 Tamil rebels
after the guerrillas killed four Moslem farmers in Sammanturai,
officials said. Six soldiers died in a rebel attack in northeastern
Talaimannar on Sunday.
   The government blames attacks on Moslem and Sinhalese civilians
on the Tamil Tigers, the militia fighting for an independent Tamil
homeland in the north and east.
   The Tigers said Saturday's killings were carried out by
pro-government Tamil agents to discredit their organization.
   ``Why should we attack Moslems?,'' said Lawrence Thilakar, a
Tamil Tiger leader, from the group's press office in London.
   ``We need the fullest cooperation of the Moslem people,'' he
said. ``This dangerous game being played by the government will not
last long, very soon the truth will come out.''
   Tamil separatists, seeking an independent nation, resumed
fighting the Sinhalese-dominated government on June 11, breaking a
13-month cease-fire.
   At least 3,200 combatants have been killed since June. Hundreds
of civilians have also been killed.
   Tamils say they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese. Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people, while Sinhalese comprise 75 percent and Moslems are 7
percent.
   In all, 14,000 people have died in the civil war, which began in
1983.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Denounces Estonia's Rejection of Soviet Constitution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has strongly
denounced Estonia's rejection of the Soviet Constitution and said
the move was intended to legalize the republic's withdrawal from
the Soviet Union.
   ``Such anti-constitutional actions, ultimatums and demands have
no grounds and no future,'' Gorbachev said in a statement released
late Sunday by the official news agency Tass and published today in
Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper.
   Last Tuesday, Estonia's Parliament declared that the
constitution of the Estonia Soviet Socialist Republic was no longer
effective.
   The declaration was part of a package defining the basis for
Estonia's independence negotiations with Kremlin representatives.
   On March 30, 1990, Estonia declared a transition period toward
independence. Gorbachev rejected that move, as well as a similar
step by Latvia and an outright declaration of independence by
Lithuania.
   However, over the following months, Gorbachev has moved toward
negotiations with all three Baltic states. Sunday's strong language
broke the pattern.
   Gorbachev condemned the Estonian Parliament's move as violating
United Nations principles, international standards and the Soviet
Constitution on questions of territorial integrity and violation of
borders.
   He said the Parliament's main goal appeared to be to ``legalize
Estonia's withdrawal from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,
bypassing the people of the republic and the existing laws.''
   The statement ended by inviting Estonians to join Kremlin
representatives in working out a new union treaty. Gorbachev said a
democratic basis ``for solving the question of sovereignty'' will
be found in this framework.
   All three Baltic republics have said they will seek full
independence from the Soviet Union and do not plan to participate
in drafting the new union treaty.
   Gorbachev's statement may have been aimed at supporting
Estonia's large Russian population, which largely opposes the
republic's independence.
   Russian representatives in the Estonian Parliament walked out of
last week's vote on rejecting the Soviet Constitution.

<HEAD>French Abortion Pill Faces Difficult Time Abroad</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French abortion pill has proved to be a safe,
efficient way of terminating early pregnancy, but it faces an
uncertain future abroad.
   The drug, known as RU-486, has been denounced by the powerful
anti-abortion lobby in the United States and has not yet been
endorsed by the World Health Organization.
   It has been used with 96 percent success by more than 55,000
women, most of them in France and a few from 14 other countries,
said Catherine Euvrard, a pharmacist and spokeswoman for
Roussel-Uclaf, the manufacturer.
   Medical experts say RU-486, which must be used in the first
seven weeks of pregnancy, has great potential for reducing illegal
abortions and complications associated with surgery. The drug is
known as mifepristone and is marketed as Mifegyne.
   France approved RU-486 in 1988 and is the only country in which
it is available. Marketing is unlikely to extend beyond Britain and
perhaps a few other northern European countries for at least
another year.
   The drug prevents fertilized eggs from implanting in the uterus,
causing miscarriage. It is taken with injections of the hormone
prostaglandin, which causes uterine contractions and reduces the
risk of hemorrhaging.
   Abortions in France using RU-486 cost about $145, but 80 percent
is reimbursed under France's social insurance system, so the actual
cost to the patient is about $30.
   ``RU-486 has a direct toxic, poisonous effect on a developing
baby,'' American anti-abortion leader John Willke said in an
interview. ``If it works, it kills the baby. If the mother changes
her mind and decides not to abort, then we've given a powerful,
poisonous steroid at the time of organogenesis.''
   Willke is president of both the U.S. National Right to Life
Committee and the International Right to Life Federation, based in
Switzerland.
   Approval by the World Health Organization, a U.N. agency, is
vital to the drug's acceptance in underdeveloped countries because
of the need for followup care and fear of a black market for the
job.
   The health organization, based in Geneva, notes cautiously that
RU-486 appears to be an effective, safe approach to termination of
early pregnancy and also shows potential for treating endometriosis
and breast cancer.
   WHO spokesman Thomas Netter said, however, that the agency does
not ``believe abortion is acceptable as a family planning method.''
   Dr. Etienne-Emile Beaulieu, a consultant to Roussel-Uclaf who
developed RU-486, has claimed WHO had not approved the drug because
it feared a cutoff of U.S. funds, which make up about one-fourth of
the agency's budget.
   Washington has withheld $100 million from the U.N. Fund for
Population Activities in the past five years to protest alleged
forced abortions in China.
   In response, Netter said: ``We are studying the administration
of the drug, doses, timing, cost, logistics of delivering it to
local health services, the question of follow-up and how to avoid
misuse. We want to look at every aspect of the implementation of
RU-486 before we can advise on general use of the drug.''
   He acknowledged RU-486 was among the most sensitive matters
before the agency.
   ``If we approve it, or if we don't approve it, we'll be accused
of murder,'' he said. ``We're caught between a rock and a hard
place.''
   A major obstacle to selling RU-486 in the United States is a
threatened boycott by anti-abortion groups of products made by
Hoechst AG, Roussel-Uclaf's parent company in West Germany.
   If RU-486 ever reaches the American market, ``we will unleash a
boycott in the U.S. of any company that sells it, any subsidiary of
Roussel-Uclaf and any subsidiary of Hoechst,'' Willke said. ``It
would be a blockbuster boycott involving tens of millions of
people. The company would feel the effects immediately.''
   On the other hand, Ms. Euvrard said, ``the pro-choice side has
told us, nicely, that they will boycott us if we don't sell RU-486.
Either way, we will have a boycott.''
   In France this month, the Association of Catholic Families
condemned the ``vulgar publicity orchestrated anew'' about the
pill, which it called ``fatal for babies and, in the absence of a
precise understanding, a risk for the mother.''
   Roussel-Uclaf predicts global acceptance in 15 years.
   ``Control of overpopulation is a very big problem in the
future,'' Ms. Euvrard said. ``The problem of birth control will be
a top priority, even if we have to proceed with abortions. It's a
question of life and death for the entire planet.''

   A teen-age runner was killed by a train
after he weaved through lowered railroad crossing gates and past
flashing warning lights during a race.
   Andrew Edin, 17, of Hinckley was about 300 yards from the finish
line in the 3.5-kilometer race Saturday when he was hit by the
freight train traveling at about 35 mph, police said.
   Edin's mother and his track coach said he probably tuned out the
train's whistle because he was concentrating so hard on the race.
But sheriff's Deputy Jerry Olson said he thinks the boy saw the
train and ``made a judgment error.''
   Other runners had raced through the gates before him. His
15-year-old brother, Michael, had to be treated for shock after he,
too, reached the crossing and saw what had happened.
   The race was part of Quarry Days, an annual celebration in
Sandstone, about 70 miles north of Minneapolis.

<HEAD>More Arrests In Corruption Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have arrested about a dozen
people in what authorities called a probe of alleged corruption in
the government of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, according
to news reports today.
   Those arrested were stalwarts of Ms. Bhutto's left-of-center
Pakistan People's Party. Pakistan's President Ghulam Ishaq Khan
fired Ms. Bhutto's 20-month-old government a week ago on charges of
political ineptitude and corruption.
   Only five people have been identified, although police said at
least a dozen people were detained over the past two days. Charges
ranged from corruption to gun-running.
   Supporters of Ms. Bhutto said on condition of anonymity that
arrest orders were being drawn up for dozens more people, most of
whom live in Ms. Bhutto's power base in the interior of her home
province of Sind.
   A spokesman for Pakistan's interim prime minister Ghulam Mustafa
Jatoi said none of the arrests was politically motivated. Jatoi and
his Information Minister Abida Hussein said tribunals to probe
corruption charges will be established and conducted by Supreme
Court justices.
   Ms. Bhutto said she will not appear before a tribunal
established by her successors.
   Many of those arrested were reportedly close associates of Ms.
Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, the target of a litany of
charges of corruption.
   The former prime minister repeatedly has denied corruption
charges against her husband, a polo-playing landowner from southern
Sind province.
   Hussein said tribunals will be set up sometime before the
planned election date of Oct. 24, although it is unlikely they will
have completed their investigations before the polls.
   Ms. Bhutto said army troops had surrounded the village of her
former tourism minister Agha Tariq. It was not clear whether he had
been arrested.
   Hussein said Supreme Court justices appointed to the tribunals
will decide whether to try only elected officials or whether to
expand their mandate to include immediate family members of
politicians.
   Meanwhile, Ms. Bhutto's mother, Nusrat Bhutto, left Pakistan for
London on Sunday for medical treatment. The elder Bhutto was a
senior minister without portfolio in her daughter's Cabinet, which
put her in charge of the government when Ms. Bhutto was out of the
country.

   Rain fell in the Midwest early today and scattered fog was
reported over the East and South. Skies were cloudy in the West.
   A band of showers was forming coast to coast, winding its way
like a 3,000-mile snake from Southern California through Oklahoma
and Missouri and upwards to the tip of Maine. The storm system also
extended to Wyoming, Utah and Colorado.
   Other areas expecting rain today were the Pacific Northwest and
the Florida peninsula.
   Because of a large high-pressure system, sunny skies were
expected in southern New England, much of the East Coast and the
Deep South. Sunshine was also forecast for the northern central
part of the country and most of the West.
   Continued hot weather was expected in the West, with highs in
the 100s for much of inland California and southern Arizona. The
forecast called for temperatures in the 90s in the South, the 80s
in the East and Midwest and the 70s in the Pacific Northwest.
   The high for the nation Sunday was 119 degrees at Death Valley,
Calif.

   An earthquake jolted today the Iranian
city of Roudbar, site of the June 21 quake that killed 40,000
people in Gilan Province, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The temblor hit at 9:48 a.m. and measured 4.9 on the Richter
scale, said the agency, monitored in Nicosia. Its epicenter was 120
miles northwest of Tehran, according to the Geophysics Center of
Tehran University, it said.
   There were no immediate reports of damages or injuries.
   The quake was also felt slightly in Rasht, the provincial
capital, and lasted longer than previous aftershocks, the news
agency said.
   A temblor of magnitude 5 on the Richter scale, a measure of the
ground motion recorded on a seismograph, can cause considerable
damage in populated areas.
   Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10
times greater.

<TEXT>
   A bungling burglar got motherly treatment from
an 84-year-old woman he held hostage for 5{ hours, with a
home-cooked breakfast and a scolding about his criminal line of
work, police said.
   Ruth Wolko was held inside her Bronx apartment Sunday during a
standoff between police and Jose Cruz, 29, before he set her loose
and surrendered, Detective Dominick Misino said.
   ``They developed a very unusual rapport,'' Misino said.
   Cruz broke into Mrs. Wolko's Riverdale apartment after neighbors
called police when he allegedly was discovered ransacking another
apartment. Armed with a realistic-looking toy gun, he threatened to
shoot his hostage if police stormed the building, the detective
said.
   Mrs. Wolko calmed her captor with offerings from her
refrigerator and sincere concern about his predicament, police said.
   ``She got him juice and told him to eat,'' said neighbor Elsie
Hyman. ``She has always been a loving and a courageous person, the
classic Jewish mother.''
   During the standoff, Mrs. Wolko cooked Cruz a kosher breakfast
and asked, ``Do you have any other profession besides this one?''
she told friends.
   After the meal, she urged him to find a legitimate job. Cruz
ultimately agreed to let her go if police would give him two
cigarettes. He surrendered about two hours later.
   Outside, the alleged burglar told Mrs. Wolko ``I'm sorry, Ruth.''
   Cruz was a complete gentleman throughout the ordeal, police said.
   ``When it was over, he kept asking us if she was all right. He
was really concerned,'' Assistant Police Chief Aaron Rosenthal said.
   Cruz, a former paratrooper and prison parolee, previously has
been convicted of burglary, grand larceny and criminal possession
of stolen property.
   He will be charged with unlawful imprisonment and burglary,
police said.

   Child abuse leads a list of social ills
contributing to rising numbers of teen-agers who kill, many who are
poor and use easy-to-get guns while high on drugs, a forensics
psychologist said.
   ``We're about to see an epidemic of juvenile violence, such as
Americans have never before witnessed,'' said Charles Patrick
Ewing, who has written a book titled ``Kids Who Kill.''
   ``In the past five years, juvenile homicide has increased five
times faster than homicides committed by adults,'' Ewing said
Sunday.
   ``And it's not just murder. Murder is just the awful tip of the
iceberg,'' he said at a press conference sponsored by the
University of Buffalo at the American Psychological Association's
annual meeting here.
   The number of juveniles arrested for murder and non-negligent
homicide began a steady rise in 1985, according to figures supplied
to Ewing by the FBI. In 1989, 2,208 juveniles nationwide were
arrested on charges of murder or non-negligent manslaughter, more
than 25 percent more than the previous year. In his study of 225
juvenile killers over the past 10 years, Ewing found that more than
half came from poor backgrounds, the majority used guns and 25
percent had drugs in their systems at the time of the killings.
   He pointed to rising poverty figures and drug abuse statistics,
as well as the increasing availability of guns, but Ewing believes
escalating child abuse is the most direct influence on the growing
homcide rate among teens.
   ``Kids learn to be violent and they learn from their role
models, especially their parents,'' he said. ``And kids who are
especially brutalized by their parents learn to be the most brutal,
the mostly likely to kill others.''
   As social problems like child abuse and drug abuse worsen,
Census Bureau projections indicate a 7 percent rise in the national
juvenile population after a 3.4 percent decline during the previous
decade, he said.
   Ewing said stricter gun laws are needed, and recommended federal
controls.
   Richard Majors, a psychologist who chairs the newly formed
National Council of African-American Men, agreed with Ewing's
description of what causes teens to kill.
   Other factors include the diminishing value placed on family,
church and school, while children's peers have gained importance,
Majors said.
   He called on large corporations to sponsor mentor programs to
build urban children's self-esteem and create hope for an escape
from poverty.

<HEAD>Dollar Sharply Lower; Gold Gains</HEAD>

  The dollar was sharply lower against key currencies
in European trading today, as concern about U.S. economic
weaknesses overcame anxieties about the Middle East.
   Gold, a traditional refuge in times of turmoil, approached $400
an ounce.
   As the crisis in the Middle East has dragged on with no actual
combat, traders have turned their attention back to the fundamental
weakness in the dollar, dealers said.
   Arab leaders ``are exchanging statements, which is better than
exchanging bullets,'' said Eckhart Hager, vice president and
analyst at Chase Bank AG in Frankfurt.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 150.65 yen, up 0.90 yen from
Friday's closing rate. Later, in London, it was quoted at 150.15
yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.5749 West German marks, down from 1.5895
   _1.3209 Swiss francs, down from 1.3400
   _5.2850 French francs, down from 5.3360
   _1.7760 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7925
   _1,155.60 Italian lire, down from 1,166.50
   _1.1465 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1476
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8862, compared
with $1.8730 late Friday.
   Minori Takeuchi of Chemical Bank in Tokyo predicted that ``the
dollar would remain firm and share prices might lose ground for the
time being unless the situation improves in the Middle East.''
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $399.90 a
troy ounce this morning, up from $391.25 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $399.00, up from $390.50 late
Friday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $2.92 an ounce today to close at $397.67.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.01 a troy ounce, up
from Friday's $4.95.

<TEXT>
   President Turgut Ozal has basked in the
limelight since his country, which lies on Iraq's northern border,
became a key player in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Yet while Ozal's popularity in the West has never seemed
greater, not all Turks are happy with his paramount role in the
crisis, which began when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug 2.
   As NATO's front-line state in the region, Turkey has assumed a
strategic part in the international campaign to force Iraq out of
its tiny oil-rich neighbor and deter President Saddam Hussein from
further aggression.
   On Sunday, Parliament voted 216-151 to authorize the government
to declare war, send troops into combat and allow foreign forces on
Turkish soil, but only if the country is attacked. The vote was
seen as a setback for Ozal, who wanted much broader powers to
mobilize troops.
   There is evidence of some troop movements along both sides of
Turkey's 180-mile-long border with Iraq, although Ozal and most
Turkish officials say they do not expect an Iraqi invasion.
   The 64-year-old Ozal has led Turkey's effort to rein in Iraq. He
hopes Turkey's strong stand against Saddam will translate into more
Western support for this country, particularly in its bid to join
the European Community.
   Ozal was elected president in 1989 after six years as prime
minister. Although the presidency is normally a ceremonial post
with little executive power, he has remained Turkey's most powerful
politician.
   Since Iraq overran Kuwait, Ozal has clearly run the show. He has
chaired Cabinet meetings, plotted strategy with military chiefs and
conducted telephone diplomacy with world leaders.
   He has received most of the credit for the tough economic
sanctions imposed against Baghdad, including the closure of twin
oil pipelines across Turkey that carried more than half of Iraq's
oil exports.
   In his speech announcing the deployment of U.S. troops in Saudi
Arabia, Bush lauded Ozal as a ``staunch friend.'' Secretary of
State James A. Baker III traveled to Ankara last week to thank Ozal
for the ``forthright'' action against Iraq and assure him of NATO's
support in case of an Iraqi attack.
   But Ozal does not give the impression of a man gearing up for
war. He was in Istanbul recently dancing with his wife Semra at a
policeman's ball. When a reporter entered Ozal's office at the
Cankaya presidential palace for an interview, he found the
president watching Cable News Network and chuckling over highlights
of a brawl between the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies.
   On Sunday, as Parliament debated the war powers request, Ozal
attended a horse race in Istanbul.
   With tensions rising, Ozal went on national television last week
in a skillful performance to explain Turkey's position and calm the
nation.
   ``He went a long way to conveying to the Turkish public that the
world was acting and Turkey needed to be part of the world,'' said
a Western diplomat.
   Turkey's decision to join the economic embargo of Iraq was not
an easy one, not only because the country stands to suffer more
than $2 billion in losses as a result of the U.N. economic
sanctions against Baghdad.
   Just as importantly, Ankara has sought friendly relations with
Iraq and other Moslem and Arab nations of the region, while at the
same time seeking to be part of the West.
   Ozal, a devout Moslem, stresses Turkey has not upset its
delicate balance between Europe and Asia. ``We wear two hats, as a
modern nation allied with the West and as a member of the Islamic
bloc,'' he said Saturday. ``We want to continue this.''
   Until recently, Turkey felt it was losing importance in the eyes
of the West following the end of the Cold War. But Ozal hopes the
current spotlight on Turkey will give the country renewed status
within the West.
   ``This crisis has highlighted Turkey's importance in the Middle
East as a stable and modern country,'' he said.
   Ozal's election by Parliament was boycotted by opposition
parties, which accused him of nepotism, corruption and
high-spending during his term as premier.
   Now the opposition accuses him of exceeding the powers of the
presidency and violating the constitution. During a heated
parliamentary debate Sunday, chief opposition leader Erdal Inonu
compared Ozal to a dictator.
   Others say strong leadership is just what is needed. Columnist
Ilnur Cevik wrote in Sunday's English language Turkish Daily News:
``As we sail though the current crisis, we are better off having an
able captain than being run aground by someone else.''

<HEAD>Kaifu Postpones Trip To Deal With Gulf Policy</HEAD>

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu postponed a trip to
the Middle East because he is needed in Tokyo to decide Japan's
policy on supporting the international force arrayed against Iraq,
officials said today.
   Makoto Watanabe, director of the Foreign Ministry's Middle East
affairs bureau, appeared to leave open the possibility that Japan
would consider military or military-related aid even while
observing the no-war clause in the Japanese constitution.
   The constitution, imposed by U.S.-led occupation authorities
after World War II, is interpreted as limiting Japan's military
forces strictly to self-defense and forbidding use of Japanese
troops abroad.
   A decision to send troops openly to the Persian Gulf would raise
a tremendous controversy in Japan, though indirect assistance in
support of the multinational military force might be acceptable to
the public.
   Kaifu had been scheduled to depart Wednesday on a 13-day trip to
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Oman and Jordan _ all of which are
embroiled in the Iraqi crisis. He would have been the first outside
head of government to venture into the region since Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Scheduled long in advance, the trip had been planned as a
general effort to improve relations with countries in the region
that supplies 70 percent of Japan's oil.
   The decision to postpone was announced this morning after
meetings during the weekend among Kaifu and top Cabinet officials.
   ``The situation has changed. The purpose of the trip was forced
to change, and since it has become a hair-trigger crisis, we made
that decision,'' Kaifu said in brief comments to reporters.
   Government spokesman Misoji Sakamoto, the chief Cabinet
secretary, said it was ``necessary for the prime minister to stay
in Tokyo and grasp all the reins of government in order to decide a
concrete policy as soon as possible.''
   Kaifu hopes to reschedule the trip by early October. Meanwhile,
Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama will visit the same countries to get
further information on how Japan may help, Watanabe told foreign
journalists.
   Asked repeatedly if Japan ruled out sending military aid,
Watanabe said several times, ``We will examine all possible
measures while observing the provisions of the constitution.''
   He said Japan was determined to decide on ``concrete measures''
to assist the international force, which already includes U.S.,
Egyptian, British and French forces.
   Japan has banned all trade with Iraq and Kuwait, which were
supplying 11.2 percent of Japan's oil in the first half of 1990.
   The decision has not caused fuel prices to rise in Japan, but
economic worries have knocked Tokyo stocks off a cliff. The closely
watched Nikkei index of 225 shares has declined 15.12 percent since
Aug. 2, closing today at 26,176.43.
   Today's big drop of 4.22 percent came on extremely thin trading,
as this week is Japan's traditional mid-summer holiday.
   Government offices will start energy-conservation measures such
as reducing the use of air conditioning and lighting, and encourage
the private sector to do the same, Kyodo News Service quoted
officials at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry as
saying.
   The Iraq-Kuwait crisis marks the second time in three years that
the Middle East has thrown Japan's non-military postureinto an
uncomfortable light. It makes Japan vulnerable to accusations of
taking a ``free ride'' when others have to risk manpower, money and
prestige to ensure the flow of oil from the Middle East.
   In 1987 the attacks on oil tankers by both sides in the
Iran-Iraq war caused some to urge Japan to send at least
minesweepers to the Gulf. But the government of Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone decided the constitution would bar sending
military forces.
   Later, Japan took a number of supportive steps: It paid to
install advanced navigational equipment in the Gulf, extended loans
and a credit line to Jordan and increased its payments to support
U.S. troops based in Japan.
   Japanese news reports said Washington had encouraged Kaifu to go
on the planned Mideast trip. Neither the Foreign Ministry nor the
U.S. Embassy would deny the reports.
   The reports said U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who
met Kaifu in Tokyo on Sunday, had said the United States supported
the trip.

   A surrogate mother carrying a couple's
test-tube baby says she wants to keep it because the biological
parents haven't lived up to their end of the deal and are therefore
unfit.
   ``This is the first case that I'm aware of where the surrogate
is biologically a stranger and is seeking custodial rights,'' said
Christian Van Deusen, the couple's lawyer.
   Anna Johnson, 29, intends to sue the couple, identified only as
Mark and Chris, for custody, child support and damages for
emotional distress. She said she would file the suit today in
Superior Court.
   Ms. Johnson signed a $10,000 contract to have the couple's
embryo implanted and bear the child to term. She was hired because
the biological mother had undergone a hysterectomy.
   The mother's egg and her husband's sperm were brought together
in a laboratory to produce three embryos, which were implanted Jan.
19. One survived.
   The highly publicized Baby M dispute four years ago in New
Jersey centered on a child conceived with a surrogate mother's egg
and the sperm of a man hiring the surrogate. The man's wife had no
biological ties to the child.
   Like Mary Beth Whitehead, the surrogate mother in the Baby M
case, Ms. Johnson said she saw the surrogate contract as a
financial opportunity.
   ``I thought I could save up some money, get a car, and put
myself through (graduate) nursing school,'' she said.
   Her lawsuit will contend the couple lost interest in her
pregnancy, gave her no emotional support, were late with her
monthly payments and failed to buy her a life insurance policy the
contract required.
   ``They never held up their end of the deal,'' she said. ``They
were showing their irresponsibility and the fact that they would
not be attentive parents. To me, this is fetal neglect.''
   Van Deusen denied the allegations.
   ``Every payment that she was due was paid on time and, in fact,
two major payments were made early,'' Van Deusen said.
   An insurance policy was arranged through an agent but Ms.
Johnson never filled out the application despite repeated requests,
he said.
   The couple contend Ms. Johnson broke the contract's
confidentiality requirement, the Orange County Register reported
Sunday.

   For more than a decade, Rose Hoffman nosed
around biker bars, braved threats and talked to virtually everyone
she met in an effort to find her son.
   Her quest ended this month when three men were convicted of
sodomizing and murdering 20-year-old Gus Hoffman Jr. and stealing
his motorcycle.
   His mother's ordeal began in 1978, when the young man didn't
return to his San Jose home the night of July 4.
   ``We're a very close family, and when your son doesn't come home
all night, you right then know something is definitely wrong,''
Mrs. Hoffman said. ``I would brag he was home every night, and I
would say at least I know where he is.''
   Hoffman was last seen on his rebuilt Harley-Davidson motorcycle
at a San Jose intersection. Witnesses said he was being chased by
two other motorcycles and a car filled with people. Neither his
body nor the motorcycle was ever found.
   ``My son was a very gullible young kid. He helped a lot of
people in his life. He had a heart of gold,'' Mrs. Hoffman said.
``The bike was the reason he was killed. He spent almost all his
money ... on that bike. He only had it running for three weeks, and
then he was missing.''
   Immediately after their son's disappearance, the Hoffmans hired
private investigators, sent out fliers and offered rewards. Mrs.
Hoffman, now 55, began checking out biker bars and other places
zfor information.
   ``I didn't care if I went into a grocery store or liquor store,
I talked to people,'' she said. ``I just would not give up. I'm
very, very persistent. He was my son. ... What would you do for
your son?''
   She said she was threatened and told to stop asking questions.
``But it didn't bother me,'' she said, adding that ``there are a
lot of good bikers out there.''
   The case had been assigned as well to police, who didn't find
much. But Mrs. Hoffman kept dogging them to pursue the case. On her
own, she learned that a man named Michael Lee Stevenson might have
had something to do with her son's disappearance.
   In 1987, the San Jose Police Department's homicide chief, in an
attempt to close the books on old cases by assigning them to night
detectives, gave the case to Sgts. Jack Baxter and Jeff Ouimet.
They took it from there.
   ``We knew we had leads and witnesses to talk to, which led us to
other witnesses,'' Ouimet said. ``There was a ray of hope there
which felt pretty good.''
   A key prosecution witness turned up: the ex-wife of suspect
Richard Morris Dollar, who said she witnessed the attack.
   Deputy District Attorney Don Shearer said the woman, whose name
was withheld, had kept silent for years for fear of retribution
from Stevenson and the legal system.
   But Stevenson, in whose garage the assault is believed to have
occurred, was shot to death in 1986 by an elderly man after trying
to shake down the man's son, Shearer said.
   In 1988, Dollar and two other alleged motorcycle gang members
were arrested in Gus Hoffman's slaying.
   Dollar, 34, Michael Allen Hodges, 38, and John Michael Stelle,
49, face a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole at
sentencing Oct. 17.
   Hodges' attorney, Francis Cavagnaro, said he will seek a new
trial.
   ``It did not bring our son back,'' Mrs. Hoffman said of the
conviction. ``But we did what we could to get justice, and our
prayers were answered.''

   Thousands of West Bank Palestinians rallied
today in support of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, chanting ``We
are with you until victory!'' and urging him to attack Israel with
chemical weapons.
   The Israeli government, meanwhile, blasted Saddam's attempt to
link an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait with an Israeli pullout from
the occupied territories as ``cheap propaganda.''
   But analysts warned that Saddam's proposal could lead to more
violence in the 32-month Palestinian uprising against Israel.
   On Sunday, Saddam said he would pull out of Kuwait if Israel
withdrew from the West Bank and Gaza Strip and a Syria withdrew
from Lebanon, where it maintains 40,000 troops.
   President Bush, vacationing in Kennebunkport, Maine, rejected
Saddam's proposal. ``I didn't see ... anything pleasing in there at
all,'' Bush said.
   The proposal was Saddam's third attempt in five days to involve
Israel in the Persian Gulf crisis in a bid for grass-roots support
from Arab countries. Saddam invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and
subsequently annexed the emirate.
   Saddam's proposal drew praise from Palestinians, long frustrated
by failed peace attempts.
   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, at least 2,000 people
marched through the winding alleys of the old marketplace waving
Iraqi flags and carried poster-sized pictures of Saddam and
Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat, who has
allied himself with Iraq.
   ``Saddam, we are with you till victory!'' they chanted.
   ``Get rid of the collaborators working with the crusaders!''
shouted others.
   Many Arabs perceive support for Iraq as part of a holy war
against Western influence in the Middle East. They compare the U.S.
forces in the Persian Gulf to the crusaders of the Middle Ages.
   In Nablus, Israeli troops fired tear gas at the marchers, but
there were no reports of injuries.
   In the West Bank town of Jenin, about 1,000 Palestinians
participated in a pro-Saddam march, shouting ``Saddam, you hero,
attack Israel with chemical weapons.''
   Another march was reported in the Balata refugee camp near
Nablus, where about 300 masked activists carried posters of Saddam
and Iraqi flags.
   The marches were the most dramatic signs yet of Palestinian
support for Saddam.
   Palestinian observers said such support for an Arab leader has
not been seen in the occupied territories since mass demonstrations
in 1970 to hail Egypt's hard-line President Gamal Abdel Nasser.
   They noted that since Arafat had linked his fate so closely to
that of Saddam, a defeat of Iraq in the current crisis would mean a
serious setback for the Palestinian cause.
   In several cities, masked activists used loudspeakers to shout
slogans in support of Iraq, calling for a ``war against reactionary
forces ... and all the leaders who support the American colonialist
position.''
   In Gaza, the Moslem fundamentalist Hamas group issued a sharply
worded leaflet calling on Saddam ``to attack the heart of Tel Aviv
if Iraq is attacked by Western crusaders.''
   The leaflet also called on Palestinians to prepare themselves
for a ``long and tough holy war'' against Israel and its Western
allies and urged the Arab countries to attack American and other
Western interests in the Arab world.
   Sunday, the military refused to comment on foreign reports that
Israel placed its air force on alert and moved anti-aircraft
missiles to the Jordanian border following threats from Iraq to use
chemical weapons against it.
   Israeli stores have reported a huge increase in purchases of gas
masks.

   Iraq's last major oil export outlet, a
pipeline across the Arabian peninsula, is effectively closed and an
Iraqi tanker was turned away when it tried to load at the
pipeline's terminal, diplomatic sources said today.
   The sources at the terminal at Yanbu, Saudi Arabia said the
tanker al-Qaddisiyah arrived Sunday evening and ``just tried to get
alongside the jetty.'' They spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Tugs that are necessary to help the ships dock did not aid the
tanker, and the vessel sailed away today without taking on oil, the
sources said. Pumping through the pipeline also ceased, they said.
   Saudi officials refused to comment. The kingdom has not said
publicly it would block the oil flow from the pipeline.
   But the diplomatic sources said there was no doubt Saudi
authorities both turned away the tanker and declared the pipeline
shut.
   About 1.5 million gallons of Iraqi crude had been passing
through the pipeline daily until a boycott by most countries of
Iraqi oil forced Baghdad to reduce the flow last week.
   The other main outlets for Iraqi crude had been two pipelines
through Turkey to the Mediterranean. Those lines are no longer in
operation.
   Iraq depends on oil revenue as its main source of income. Its
daily OPEC production quota is 3.14 million barrels a day, but
punitive actions taken since its invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 have
virtually eliminated the market for Iraqi oil.
   The giant Saudi Aramco company operates both the Saudi pipeline
and the terminal.
   The Iraqis had continued to pump oil through the pipeline at a
reduced rate because the tanks at the terminal were half full. Oil
executives, speaking anonymously, said the tanks are now full, at
about 10 million barrels.
   During the Iran-Iraq war, Iraq also trucked oil through Jordan
to the Red Sea port of Aqaba. Jordan has avoided saying anything
about allowing Iraqi oil transports, other than to say it would
abide in principle with a U.N. Security Council resolution ordering
an embargo on Iraqi goods.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said the United States
would intercept Iraqi oil shipments to ensure full implementation
of U.N. Security Council embargo.
   There are at least nine U.S. warships and two aircraft carriers
in the Persian Gulf region. There are also warships from Britain,
France and the Soviet Union in the area to help enforce the U.N.
sanctions.
   The United States has not been using the word blockade but Baker
said there was ``legal basis'' to enforce the sanctions.
   The pipeline through Saudi Arabia is capable of pumping 1.5
million barrels of oil daily and had been pumping at about 900,000
daily. After the U.N. sanctions were approved Aug. 6, the Iraqis
slowed pumping to 400,000 barrels per day, according to some
sources. Others said it had been as low as 200,000 barrels per day.
   Customers of Iraqi oil stopped picking up their imports
immediately after the U.N. resolution was passed. Two tankers were
scheduled to turn up at the Yanbu terminal after the resolution but
did not show up. One was Norwegian, the other Indian.

<HEAD>Two Protesters Charge They Were Run Down by Navy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two animal rights activists say they were
struck repeatedly by Navy boats as they tried to block explosives
tests that they say are harmful to dolphins.
   The Navy conceded the men could have been hit during the protest
Friday near the Dry Tortugas islands, but said they were not hit
repeatedly and not on purpose.
   Russ Rector, who joined Richard O'Barry _ former trainer of the
television dolphin Flipper _ in the protest, charged the incident
was no accident.
   ``They used boats as weapons,'' Rector said. ``They ran right
over me. I dove down and, by the grace of God, I'm not chewed up by
propellers.''
   O'Barry, 50, suffered a concussion and bruises, according to a
medical report from Florida Keys Memorial Hospital, and Rector
suffered a back injury and bruises.
   ``Apparently they were pursued, and one of the boats could have
hit them,'' said Dan Probert, who is overseeing the Navy trials of
the explosives.
   Probert said he spoke with the FBI on Saturday about the
incident.
   Dolphin activists have demanded cancellation of the Navy tests
because of dolphin sightings in the area. Fishermen want the tests
suspended because the region is home to several seafood varieties,
and environmentalists are concerned about possible damage to nearby
coral reefs.
   O'Barry and Rector, 42, were dropped from a sea plane into the
test zone 85 miles northwest of Key West in the Gulf of Mexico.
   The pair were swimming when they saw boats approach, said
Lincoln O'Barry, Richard's son and vice president of an activist
group called the Dolphin Project.
   According to Rector, the two men were run over by a boat about
60 feet long and then repeatedly hit by other smaller boats.
O'Barry said he was hit in the head and jabbed in the face with an
aluminum pole.
   Probert described the scene differently.
   ``We have no indication of boats running over them repeatedly.
So far as we know, (O'Barry and Rector) were swimming around boats
trying to get to the target buoy,'' he said. ``As the boat was
backing away, it appears (O'Barry) was not looking at the boat.
They just literally ran into each other.''
   The two activists didn't know at the time that the Navy's
explosives test had been completed 45 minutes before the incident,
Lincoln O'Barry said.
   The two men were pulled from the water by the Coast Guard and
taken to the hospital in Key West on stretchers.

<TEXT>
   At a cross ringed with barbed wire, Germans
from East and West paid solemn tribute today to the victims of the
Berlin Wall on the 29th anniversary of its construction.
   Eighty East Germans died trying to escape across the
now-crumbling barrier that began separating the city on Aug. 13,
1961.
   The best-known of them is Peter Fechter, an 18-year-old East
Berlin worker cut down by Communist border guards' bullets in 1962.
Fechter lay bleeding to death for nearly an hour before he was
hauled away.
   ``Here where Peter Fechter died, we can feel how much suffering
the wall caused,'' said East Berlin Mayor Tino Schwierzina during
the ceremony this morning.
   Schwierzina stood beside the cross erected as a memorial to
Fechter in West Berlin. It is located near where Fechter lay dying
and calling out ``help me.''
   A weathered photograph of the young man lying in agony on Aug.
17, 1962, is tacked to the dark wood.
   About 300 people, most of them Germans, gathered for the brief
service under a brilliant sun. More than a dozen large flower
arrangements were placed before the cross.
   Although the wall has disappeared there, windows in buildings on
the Eastern side still have the bars that kept people from jumping
to freedom.
   In years past, the Communist East Germans marked the wall's
anniversary with bombastic military parades that drew criticism
from the Western Allies.
   With the wall vanishing and Germans rushing to unification,
today's service was the first joint memorial officially linking
both sides.
   West Berlin officials promised that part of the Berlin Wall will
be kept intact as a reminder to future generations.
   ``The wall cannot disappear completely,'' said city councilor
Erich Paetzold. He said a remainder will be preserved ``so that we
don't forget what happened here, so that no one forgets what
happened here.''
   ``The open wound is closing, but a scar will stay forever,''
Paetzold added.
   Paetzold and the other officials later talked quietly with
Fechter's sister Ruth, who had taken part in the ceremony.
   Despite the solemn commemoration of the wall's victims, this
year's anniversary will have an air of celebration. Tonight, the
Rolling Stones are planning a concert in an outdoor sports stadium
in East Berlin, and the Japanese symphony orchestra Saito Kinen,
conducted by Seiji Ozawa, is to play what was billed as ``The
Berlin Wall Memorial Concert.''
   Twenty-nine years ago, East German military and paramilitary
units stunned the world by hastily erecting the foundations for the
ugly concrete barrier.
   The wall was built to halt the exodus of East Germans to the
West. More than 2.5 million East Germans fled to the West from 1949
until the wall went up.
   The barrier was watched over by armed guards with
``shoot-to-kill'' orders.
   On Nov. 9, 1989, East Germany's Communist government opened the
wall in a frantic bid to retain power and halt a renewed exodus of
200,000 people.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tom Korologos has some advice for Supreme
Court nominee David H. Souter. It's the same advice he's given
countless nominees he has shepherded through Senate confirmation.
``Get ready. Expect the unexpected.''
   Korologos, a veteran Washington lobbyist and former White House
aide, is active only on the fringes of the Souter nomination,
lending his counsel when called upon.
   But he has been in the thick of the battle for confirmation of
several current justices as well as in the bruising and
unsuccessful 1987 fight to win Senate approval for Robert H. Bork.
   In the past two decades, he estimates he has helped steer
between 200 and 300 ambassadors, judges and other government
officials through confirmation, ranging from two vice presidents to
``people nobody ever heard of.''
   ``You tell them the hearing process is not fair,'' he said in an
interview in the ornate reception room just off the Senate floor.
``It is not judicial. It is not done on a level playing field. The
senators even sit higher than you do.''
   ``You say the Constitution stops at the hearing room door,'' he
said. ``Hearsay evidence is admissible; rumors are admissible.
There is no subject on earth to which a senator might not wish to
address himself, whether it's about Roe vs. Wade or the designated
hitter.
   ``So get ready. Expect the unexpected.''
   Korologos, 57, a former Salt Lake City political reporter, came
to Washington as an aide to Sen. Wallace Bennett, R-Utah, and
became an assistant to Presidents Nixon and Ford. He now is
president of the Washington lobbying firm of Timmons and Co. and
offers his help for nominees as a free service.
   The first step, he said, is to sit down with the nominee and ask
some questions, such as, ``Do they know what they are getting
into?''
   ``Most do not,'' said Korologos. ``Chances are he has never gone
through a Senate confirmation.''
   Souter has been through the mill once before, when he was
confirmed as a member of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, but
such hearings usually are perfunctory.
   This time around is sure to take longer. The Senate Judiciary
Committee says it will open hearings on Sept. 13 on Souter's
nomination to succeed retired Justice William J. Brennan Jr.
   Korologos said one of his next steps is to study the voluminous
financial disclosure and other papers that a nominee must fill out,
``to see if there's anything that telegraphs what's going to be
coming at you.''
   He asks the nominee if there is anything in his background that
would be embarrassing to him or the president.
   ``I am not asking you to tell me,'' he says. ``I am asking you
to get an answer in your head, because those guys on the Hill are
going to find it out.''
   Next come courtesy calls on members of the Senate Judiciary
Committee and other senators with key roles in the confirmation
process. An aide tags along, taking notes on what questions the
senators ask.
   The next step is known as the murder board.
   ``You ge a bunch of people to sit around a table and fire the
rottenest, worst questions you can possibly think of at these
guys,'' Korologos said.
   He usually starts out by asking, ``Mr. Jones, when did you first
find out the young lady in question was only 15 years old?''
   ``Everybody laughs and I make the point that it could be that
bad,'' said Korologos.
   ``You help him with answers,'' he said. ``You don't try to
insert anything into his principles. But if he bobs and weaves and
ducks, you say to him, `That's unacceptable; you've got to get a
better answer than that.'''
   ``Soon, though, he's ready, and the questions from the senators
aren't half as bad as the ones you asked him.''
   At least not usually, Korologos said. Occasionally, they are
worse.

   Actress Sara Seegar, who played Mrs.
Wilson on the television series ``Dennis the Menace,'' has died.
   She was 76 and lived in Newtown. She died Sunday at St. Mary
Hospital. Cause of death was not given.
   Ms. Seegar, who in private life was known as Sara Seegar Stone,
appeared as a character actress on Broadway and in London, on radio
and television and as one of the town ladies in the movie version
of ``The Music Man.''
   She also appeared 14 seasons at the Bucks County Playhouse in

the American College Theater Festival, the Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts and the music and theater department of the Army.
   ``Dennis the Menace'' was broadcast from 1959 to 1963. Ms.
Seegar played the second Mrs. Wilson from 1962 to 1963 after the
actor playing the first Mr. Wilson, the naughty protagonist's
curmudgeonly neighbor, died and was replaced by Gale Gordon.
   In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Josef; a
daughter, Francine Lida Stone; two sisters; and four grandchildren.
   Services will be private.

   Thousands of radical students and
dissidents shouting ``Unification!'' rallied today at a university
to demand free travel to Communist North Korea.
   Police fired tear gas to disperse the protesters, and several
dozen students hurled stones.
   There were no injuries or arrests at the protest outside Seoul's
Yonsei University, where the 3,000 protesters had gathered in
support of unification.
   But in a separate incident, seven students were arrested trying
to cross Freedom Bridge, a major access to the border. Another five
radicals were arrested in downtown Seoul shouting anti-government
slogans.
   Also near the border, fifteen rightists were arrested after
cutting a barbed wire fence and trying to march toward the
Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas.
   ``North, open the border,'' they shouted, accusing Pyongyang
authorities of blocking reunions with their families, who live in
North Korea.
   South Korea proposed opening its heavily guarded border last
Saturday for unrestricted travel to North Korea, but the proposal
collapsed after both sides failed to agree on procedures.
   The Korean peninsula was divided in 1945. South Korea and North
Korea have been bitter rivals since the division. They fought a
three-year war in the early 1950's. The border is sealed and there
is no mail or other forms of communication between the two sides.
   The protesters at Yonsei University, a hotbed of anti-government
protests, shouted support for a unification rally to be held with
North Koreans at the border truce village of Panmunjom on Wednesday.
   The Seoul government has said that South Koreans can not attend
the meeting unless North Korea guarantees their safety in writing.
   More than 61,000 South Koreans have applied to visit the North
during the five-day trial border opening.
   At the rally, a group of folk dancers beat drums and gongs under
a huge painting of a South Korean student jailed for making an
illegal trip to North Korea last year without government approval.
   The woman student, Im Su-kyong, is hailed by North Korea and
South Korean dissidents as ``the flower of unification.''

   Time was, being a lifeguard was a dream job:
sitting atop a white tower, a bronzed Adonis for the bikini-clad
teen-age girls to admire.
   These days, it's hard to find people interested in the job.
   Because of chronically low wages and costly and more rigorous
certification lessons, potential candidates, especially in the
Northeast, are drawn to easier, better paying jobs _ like flipping
burgers in fast-food restaurants.
   Some beaches and pools in New England and the mid-Atlantic
states have closed for lack of lifeguards, according to the U.S.
Lifesaving Association.
   ``Not too long ago we had waiting lists of applicants,'' said
Tim Hall, lifeguard coordinator for the Maine Bureau of Parks and
Recreation.
   ``Now we have to go out and recruit them. The booming economy of
the late '80s made summer jobs more available to college students.
Work as chambermaids, waitresses and construction workers paid
more.''
   Those who do sign up, from California to Florida, are frequently
much younger than in years past and not always as conscientious,
longtime lifeguards said.
   ``Anyone can put on an orange suit but these young guys don't
know what to look for,'' said Rian Wilkinson, a veteran lifeguard
from Newport, R.I. ``They just sit on the stands and there aren't
any older guys around to keep them from goofing off.''
   Part of the shortage stems from tougher and more expensive
training. In 1982, the Red Cross introduced a national lifeguard
certification program to replace the simpler lifesaving courses
designed for the general public.
   ``Now kids have to pay $75 or $80 for certification when it used
to be free, and so they'd rather work somewhere else,'' said Joe
Pecoraro, president of the U.S. Lifeguard Association and general
supervisor of beaches and pools for Chicago.
   ``It used to a be a glamour position,'' said Donald Cotter,
recreation director in Foxboro, who began recruiting lifeguards in
January and did not sign up his last one until a week before the
season opened. ``Young kids just don't want to do the training.''
   Many in the profession say the tougher requirements are part of
a plan to ensure that lifeguards are better trained and more
professional.
   ``What we call the `beach mystique' is still there,'' said Hall.
``But the lifeguard's image has basically changed and that's good.
We're not looking for people who want to smear suntan lotion on
their bodies and look for women. We're looking for people who are
interested in someday being policemen, firemen, paramedics _ who'll
see lifeguarding as an emergency service provider.''
   John Crisp, 42, assistant chief for lifeguards in the Daytona
Beach, Fla., area, said Volusia County takes lifeguards at 16 in
the hope they ``stick with us through high school and college and
turn into a real professional.''
   ``When I first came on here in 1972, it was party time,
something to do to kill a few years,'' said Crisp. ``But now we're
trying for a more professional image.''

   Thousands of protesters, angered by a
monthlong Mohawk blockade of a major commuter bridge, hurled
bottles and rocks at police, who responded with tear gas.
   At least 75 people, including 16 police officers, were injured
but none of the injuries were serious, police said. Eighteen people
were briefly arrested following the four-hour melee late Sunday at
Mercier Bridge, which connects Montreal with its suburbs.
   About 10,000 people participated in the demonstration at its
peak.
   Earlier in the day, an agreement was signed between the Indians
and the federal and provincial governments to start negotiations to
bring down the Mohawk barricades.
   The Indians are blocking the bridge to protest plans to expand a
golf course on what they claim is sacred tribal land.
   Today, broken bottles, bricks, rocks the size of grapefruit and
tear gas canisters littered the area. Three large plate glass
windows in the front of a nearby furniture store were smashed.
   Quebec Native Affairs Minister John Ciaccia said the talks were
expected to start within two days, after a team of 24 international
observers chosen by the International Federation of Human Rights
arrives.
   The observers will remain on the scene until the Mohawks remove
their barricades and all police forces are withdrawn.
   Sunday's ceremony, also attended by federal Indian Affairs
Minister Tom Siddon, was held in the pine forest behind Mohawk
barricades in Oka.
   The Mohawks signed the agreement after provincial and federal
government officials agreed to allow international observers. They
will verify the free flow of food and supplies through the Mohawk
barricades and to permit unimpeded access for Mohawk advisers.
   Mohawk negotiator Ellen Gabriel said the Indians would not
remove their barricades in Oka and at the Kahnawake reserve south
of Montreal, where a main commuter bridge has been blocked, unless
there is a final agreement.
   A dispute over town plans to expand a golf course on ancestral
land claimed by the Mohawks led to a July 11 gunbattle between
Indians and Quebec police at Oka, 18 miles west of Montreal, and
the two sides have faced each other across barricades since then.
   An officer was shot to death in the clash that began when police
tried to storm a barricade put up by the Mohawks. Responsibility in
the death has not been established.
   Residents of Chateauguay and other southern suburbs across the
St. Lawrence River from Montreal have been demonstrating and
blocking roads in frustration at the Mohawks' blockade of the
Mercier Bridge, which has forced them to take long detours to reach
the city.
   On Sunday, about 100 local residents blocked a drawbridge with
vehicles, stopping boat traffic for several hours on the St.
Lawrency Seaway.
   The demonstrators were allowed to occupy the bridge until after
the late afternoon announcement about the agreement in Oka.
   About 100 riot police then moved in to clear them out, and one
officer received a cut to the head in a scuffle with demonstrators.
Two protesters were arrested.

   Giant 2,000-year-old
sequoias were treated with fire retardant to protect them against
flames advancing today through the majestic forest that
photographer Ansel Adams captured on film.
   In Oregon, 1,200 Army soldiers were being sent to take up
firefighting positions. Fires also burned in Alaska, Washington,
Idaho and Utah.
   Drought and the threat of more lightning in California worried
fire officials after more than 200,000 acres burned statewide in
the past week.
   ``More lightning means more fires,'' said Forestry Department
spokesman Chris Parker. ``What we're seeing is the culmination of
four years' drought.''
   Yosemite was declared off limits to tourists Friday. By Sunday,
more than 2,200 firefighters were battling two fires in the park
that have burned 17,000 acres. The flames were about 10 miles from
landmarks like El Capitan, Half Dome and Yosemite Falls, and within
two miles of a stand of giant sequoias.
   Workers tried to protect the trees by clearing debris and
undergrowth from around their trunks and applying a chemical fire
retardant.
   Seventy-five people fled a park settlement Sunday to escape the
one of the fires.
   Fires have burned 127 structures since last week in California
ranging from outbuildings to homes. Sixty-six were in Foresta, near
Yosemite. The park, which usually gets 25,000 weekend visitors, was
empty of tourists.
   ``There's a degree of peacefulness, if you are not caught up in
the frantic business of firefighting,'' said Jeff Nicholas, curator
of Yosemite's Ansel Adams photo gallery.
   More than $10 million in property has been destroyed by the
fires, Yosemite fire officials said Sunday. The cost of fighting
the fire had passed $1.5 million Sunday evening.
   The park's chief naturalist, Len McKenzie, called the fires
catastrophic and blamed past park management for the size and
intensity of the blazes. By suppressing all wildfires in the
forest, he said, a huge buildup of dead wood, dry grass and other
fuel built up.
   ``We overprotected the forest,'' he said.
   Thunderstorms like those that brought 24,000 recorded lightning
strikes last week to California were expected to return by Tuesday.
The state has had below-average precipitation since the mid-1980s.
   In Tehama County, about 200 miles north of Yosemite, two blazes
have charred a combined 130,000 acres of forest. In Sequoia
National Forest, about 100 miles south of Yosemite, a fire had
burned more than 24,000 acres.
   ``The 200,000-acre figure for the state is probably pretty
conservative,'' said Forestry Department spokeswoman Karen Terrill.
``What I hear the experts saying is that this could get to be much,
much worse.''
   More than 12,000 firefighters were on duty around the state,
most of them battling 14 major fires.
   More than 6,000 people worked Sunday to corral five lightning
fires that have burned more than 120,000 acres of eastern Oregon,
said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Jim Guest. About 100 soldiers
from Fort Lewis, Wash., were sent to Oregon on Sunday. A total of
1,100 more were to follow today after some quick training.
   A mule deer and its fawn returned to a charred area after
surviving the largest of the Oregon fires. ``It's nice to see the
animals come back,'' said Risa Lange-Navarro, a Forest Service
field observer.
   Oregon's two largest fires, measuring 73,700 acres and 18,925
acres, were expected to be encircled by fire lines today. A third
was surrounded late Sunday and firefighters reported making headway
in trying to control the two others.
   Several smaller lightning-sparked fires kept Washington
firefighters busy. A rash of forest and range fires that broke out
in Idaho last week were brought under control Sunday.
   The Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, which coordinates
the fighting of forest fires around the country, said nearly 20,000
firefighters were at work Sunday on fires covering 856,000 acres,
more than half of that in Alaska.
   The weather cooperated with firefighters battling blazes
throughout Utah as rain and higher humidity helped crews contain
the state's two biggest blazes and slow the spread of several
others.

   An Iraqi oil tanker steamed away empty from a loading terminal
today after Saudi Arabia refused to let it dock, diplomatic sources
said. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein urged his countrymen to be
frugal in anticipation of a drawn-out conflict.
   Saddam, in an apparent attempt to change the focus of debate on
the Persian Gulf crisis, offered Sunday to pull out his troops from
Kuwait if Israel withdraws from the occupied territories. The
United States and Israel rejected the idea, but thousands of
Palestinians rallied to support Saddam.
   The Iraqi leader tested the strength of worldwide sanctions by
sending a tanker to a Red Sea terminal Sunday to take on oil from
an Iraqi pipeline.
   Sources at the terminal at Yanbu, Saudi Arabia, said the tanker
al-Qaddisiyah was unable to gain entry because tugs necessary to
help ships dock did not appear. The same sources said that pumping
through the pipeline had ceased.
   The Saudi pipeline was Iraq's last major operating oil export
outlet following the closure of two pipelines through Turkey last
week in retaliation for the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Saddam's army took over the wealthy sheikdom Aug. 2 in a dispute
over oil, land and money, then began massing along the border of
Saudi Arabia, which has the world's largest oil reserves.
   Western nations quickly boycotted Iraqi goods, including the
vital oil, and some Arab nations last week joined the sanctions.
American and Arab soldiers were deployed to defend Saudi Arabia,
while European, Canadian, and Australian warships headed to the
Persian Gulf to join a U.S. flotilla.
   Also, Iraqi troops were accused of fatally shooting a British
businessman trying to flee Kuwait _ the first report of a foreigner
dying in the invasion.
   Iraqi troops refused to allow a British diplomat to recover the
body, the the Foreign Office said today.
   Saddam, in a statement read on Iraqi television, called Sunday
for ``all cases of occupation, and those cases that have been
portrayed as occupation'' to be resolved simultaneously, under the
``same principles and guidelines.''
   He said Israel must leave the West Bank and Gaza Strip and Syria
must withdraw from Lebanon if Iraq is to leave Kuwait. Israel took
the territories from Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Saddam also demanded the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Saudi
Arabia and the end to economic sanctions against his country.
   The Iraqi leader warned: ``If the spark of war is started, many
will be burned.''
   Israel dismissed Saddam's proposal as ``cheap propaganda,'' and
President Bush also rejected it. ``I didn't see ... anything
pleasing in there at all,'' said Bush, on vacation in
Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Saddam's proposal appeared aimed at broadening the debate over
his invasion of Kuwait into a discussion of a host of Middle East
problems, some of which remain unresolved after decades of talks
and war.
   Palestinian leaders in the Israeli-occupied territories welcomed
Saddam's proposal. An estimated 10,000 Palestinians staged a noisy
demonstration of support for Iraq at a refugee camp in southern
Lebanon. Chanting ``Death to America!'' the demonstrators hanged
effigies of Bush and Saudi King Fahd.
   But Hussein Musawi, leader of a branch of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah movement, criticized Palestinians for supporting Saddam.
   ``Saddam is a Satan, not a Moslem leader,'' Musawi said. ``The
one who waged war against the Islamic republic (Iran) and Syria and
who unleashed chemical weapons against the Kurds is not a hero but
a Satan.''
   There were signs the Iraqis are preparing for a long siege. One
day after warning that black marketeers in Iraq would be executed,
Saddam urged Iraqi women to cut meat and bread consumption in half
and be frugal with clothing.
   ``What is demanded is that no one stockpile food supplies,''
Saddam said. ``Stockpiles will bring about shortages.''
   The Middle East Economic Survey, a respected weekly newsletter,
reported today that despite Baghdad's claims to the contrary, the
Iraqi economy is weak and ill-prepared to withstand an economic
blockade.
   A U.N. embargo on trade has blocked outgoing oil _ Iraq's main
export _ and incoming shipments of food, military parts and
essential goods. However, the embargo may allow humanitarian
shipments of food.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the United States
would honor a request by the ousted Kuwaiti government to intercept
Iraqi oil shipments.
   ``Let's not use the word blockade,'' Baker told ABC-TV. ``Let's
just say we have the legal basis for interdicting these things.''
   U.S. and allied warships are poised to meet Iraqi tankers coming
from the Persian Gulf, Red Sea or Mediterranean Sea. Iraq is
heavily dependent on oil exports to buy food and supplies for its
17 million people.
   A French warship sailed through the Suez Canal today en route to
join three French naval units in the gulf. The Dutch government
announced it was dispatching two warships.
   Iraq is virtually encircled on the ground with the possible
exception of Jordan, where King Hussein said he is working for ``an
Arab solution.''
   In Iraq's northern neighbor, Turkey, the Parliament on Sunday
gave the government permission to declare war and send troops into
combat if Turkey is attacked.
   Iraqi Information Minister Nusayyif Jasim today denied
allegations that Iraq was planning an attack on Turkey and said
such assertions were ``part of the international conspiracy against
Iraq.''
   The United States has committed 50,000 troops to the crisis, and
about 3,000 elite Egyptian forces had arrived by Sunday, the
vanguard of 10,000-strong Arab League force. Morocco and Syria are
also sending troops.
   Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the U.S. Central
Command, told pool reporters that U.S. soldiers are aware of
possible terrorist attacks against them in the Middle East.
   Aboard the USS La Salle, flagship of the Joint Task Force Middle
East, commander Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty said U.S. troops are
prepared to defend themselves in case of an Iraqi chemical weapons
attack.
   ``The fact that they do have chemical weapons is disturbing to
everybody throughout the world,'' Fogarty said. But, he added ``We
are a trained force.... I feel confident we are prepared to defend
ourselves.''
   A U.S. airman died Sunday in Saudi Arabia after an accident,
becoming the first American killed in the desert operation, the
Pentagon said. The dead man was identified as Air Force Staff Sgt.
John Campisi, a 30-year-old aircraft maintenance technician from
Covina, Calif.
   Pentagon sources said on condition of anonymity a preliminary
investigation indicated Campisi was hit by a truck on a darkened
runway.
   Meanwhile, Iraqi soldiers shot and killed British businessman
Douglas Thomas Croskery in Kuwait as he tried to flee to Saudi
Arabia, the British government said. A source close to the family
said Croskery was slain on Saturday.
   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman called Croskery's slaying
``a barbaric crime'' and demanded Iraq punish those responsible.
   Before Saddam invaded Kuwait, he accused that country's leaders
of robbing Iraq of billions of dollars by stealing oil-rich land
and exceeding its OPEC oil cartel production quota, driving down
world oil prices.
   Saddam also had demanded that Kuwait forgive $10 billion to $20
billion in loans. Iraq has a $70 billion foreign debt.

   Salvage crews today transferred oil off a barge
that buckled and leaked about 21,000 gallons of heavy fuel oil, the
Coast Guard said. It was the Houston Ship Channel's third large
spill of the summer.
   ``Now they're just trying to clean up the remaining oil,'' said
Coast Guard Seaman Karl Christensen. ``They're using booms and
vacuum trucks, small boats and absorbent pads. There were some
skimmers and pumps supposed to be arriving later today to help with
that effort.''
   The accident occurred while the barge was being loaded at an
Arco Petrochemical dock Sunday morning.
   ``It was just sitting there at the dock and apparently, it just
started buckling in half,'' said Coast Guard Senior Chief Dale
Eichmann.
   The cause of the accident was not immediately known.
   Crews put temporary patches over fractures in the barge Sunday
evening and began transferring the oil into another vessel,
Eichmann said. The transfer was completed this morning.
   He said the barge had been loaded with 630,000 gallons of oil.
   Cleanup crews strung three containment booms around the spill,
and the ship channel remained open.
   ``It looks like we have the situation under control,'' Coast
Guard Petty Officer Richard Fleming said this morning.
   The Coast Guard on Friday finished cleaning up a 700,000-gallon
oil spill that occurred July 28 when a Greek tanker collided with
two barges. The spill bottled up ships in the busy channel and
prompted a brief ban on fishing in the rich Galveston Bay.
   Earlier this year, the Norwegian tanker Mega Borg spilled 3.9
million gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico off Galveston
after an explosion ripped through the vessel, killing four crew
members and injuring 17.

   The government said today its armed
forces repulsed an attack by Indian troops along the cease-fire
line that divides the disputed territory of Kashmir, officials
said. India denied the claim.
   The Defense Ministry said the attack on a remote observation
post in the Himalayas occurred Sunday, the day after talks ended
between the two countries to ease border tensions.
   Defense officials said Indian troops used heavy artillery,
anti-tank guns and mortars in an attempt to capture an outpost on
the KEL sector in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.
   The outpost is located about 60 miles northeast of
Muzzaffarabad, the capital of Azad (Free) Kashmir.
   ``Our forces repulsed the attack and inflicted casualties on the
intruders,'' the official said, but he gave no figures.
   In New Delhi, a spokesman for the Indian government denied any
fighting had occurred.
   ``It's not true,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be identified
under briefing rules. ``We have not attacked. We have not used any
artillery. We have not suffered any casualties.''
   Skirmishes and small arms fire are frequent along the cease-fire
line, but Sunday's assault marked the first time that heavy
artillery has been used, the defense official said.
   The Defense Ministry said India's attack had been reported to
U.N. military observers in India and Pakistan and that defense
measures had been intensified.
   The official said the use of heavy artillery and mortars was an
attempt to escalate the situation along the line of control to try
to divert world attention from a Moslem secessionist movement in
Indian-held Kashmir, the agency said.
   The uprising, which has claimed more than 950 lives since late
January, has heightened already uneasy tensions between
predominantly Hindu India and Moslem Pakistan, which were created
along religious lines in the 1947 partition of the subcontinent.
   The two countries on Saturday completed the second round of
talks aimed at a series of ``confidence-building'' measures to
relieve tensions.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the talks ``did not go well''
and that while both agreed that another round should be held, no
date was set.
   Tensions escalated last spring between the two countries in the
43-year-old dispute over Kashmir, a former princely state claimed
by both.
   India and Pakistan amassed their armies along the cease-fire
line drawn by wars in 1948 and 1965. Indian Prime Minister V.P.
Singh asked his countrymen to psychologically prepare for war.
   The crisis was averted largely due to diplomatic pressure by the
United States and the Soviet Union.
   India accuses Pakistan of arming, training and harboring Moslem
militayts in India Kashmir, a charge that Islamabad denies.
Pakistan contends India has unleased brutal force to crush an
indegenious independence movement.

   Actress Esther Rolle, who played the mother in
the 1970s hit television series ``Good Times,'' was seriously
injured in a single-car accident that killed a Texas woman,
authorities said.
   Miss Rolle, 69, was in serious but stable condition today
following the Sunday afternoon accident, said Kathleen Brown, a
nursing supervisor at University Medical Center. She declined to
provide specifics about the actress' injuries.
   The character for which Miss Rolle is best known, Florida Evans,
started on the situation comedy ``Maude'' and later became the
focus of the spinoff ``Good Times.'' In ``Maude,'' Florida Evans
was a sassy maid; in ``Good Times,'' the role focused more on how
she was the strong-willed matriarch of her family.
   Just last year, she became the first woman to receive the NAACP
Chairman's Civil Rights Leadership Award, which honored her work in
helping raise the image of blacks through her stage, television and
movie work.
   More recently, she appeared as the housekeeper Idella in the
Academy Award-winning film ``Driving Miss Daisy.''
   She was a passenger in a northbound car that rolled over on
Interstate 15 near the California border, Nevada Highway Patrol
troopers said.
   The driver was identified by the Clark County coroner's office
as Paulene Hopkins, 70, of Marshall, Texas. She was pronounced dead
at the scene.
   The car drifted off the left side of the roadway about six miles
north of the California border, overcorrected and overturned into
the median, according to Nevada Highway Patrol spokeswoman Mary
Coyne.
   Two other car passengers, Martha Jordan, 63, of Las Vegas, and
Mary Collins, 63, of Los Angeles, both received minor injuries.

   A fire early today killed four residents of a home
that houses mental health outpatients, and another resident was
charged with arson, authorities said.
   Margaret Ann Wright, 46, was taken in for questioning and
charged shortly after the blaze at the boardinghouse in a south
Dallas neighborhood, said Fire Department spokeswoman Carolyn
Garcia.
   The blaze at the two-story home was doused 45 minutes after it
was reported shortly before 4 a.m. Nine people lived at the home,
Ms. Garcia said.
   At least some of the home residents were clients of the Dallas
County Mental Health-Mental Retardation Center, authorities said.
But Barry Waller, the agency's director of mental retardation
services, could not confirm whether Ms. Wright or any of the
victims were among the agency's clients.
   The victims, whose identities were not immediately released,
ranged in age from 18 to 63, Ms. Garcia said. Three women died at
the hospital, and one at the scene. All four lived on the second
floor at the home, she said.
   The other residents, who lived on the ground floor, escaped
without harm, Ms. Garcia said.
   Ms. Garcia said the county mental health agency uses private
boardinghouses throughout the city to house outpatients.

   Potato ice cream may be a good concept,
but it isn't likely to make any flavor-of-the-month lists.
   David Lee recently won high praise for his development of potato
ice cream as part of his studies for a bachelor's degree in applied
science.
   But Lee says the commendation he received was more for the way
he replaced sugar in ice cream with potatoes rather than for the
flavor itself.
   He said potatoes gave ice cream a flour-like taste, which he
tried to counter by adding fruit pulp.
   That move was successful in small doses, but Lee said a
5.3-gallon batch he produced ``went down like the proverbial lead
balloon.''

   There are so many people who want to

   Those who are chosen will be required to observe at least one

   Nearly 50,000 people, about 12 times the number authorized, have
applied to visit China as tourists during the Sept. 22-Oct. 7 games
in Beijing. A computer will be used to choose names at random.
   The number of visitors is being restricted because of limited

   A 20-year-old man who refused
to serve in the army for political reasons was ordered freed from
jail Monday after a court reduced his six-year jail sentence.
   Charles Bester had been imprisoned 20 months, since Dec. 5,
1988. The Rand Supreme Court, in upholding Bester's appeal of the
six-year term, substituted it for a sentence of 20 months and
ordered him released.
   Bester was 19 when he was sentenced for refusing to serve two
years in the army for political reasons. He refused the option to
become a religious objector and thereby do community service
instead of going to the army.
   Earlier this year, the compulsory military training for white
male South Africans was reduced to one year.

   A U.S. theologist today was elected president of
the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, succeeding the Rev. Allan
Boesak of South Africa.
   Professor Jane Dempsey Douglass was elected by secret ballot at
a closed session of the alliance's executive committee. Last week,
the committee accepted Boesak's resignation after it was disclosed
that he had an affair with a married woman.
   Boesak did not come to Geneva to participate in the session..
   Ms. Douglass, 57, is a professor of historical theology at
Princeton Theological Seminary, in New Jersey, and an elder in the
Presbyterian Church (USA). She has become known as an outspoken
advocate of women's rights. Her publications include ``Women,
Freedom and Calvin.''
   She joined the 28-member executive committee at the alliance's
General Council meeting in Seoul in August, 1989.
   The World Alliance represents 175 churches in 84 countries with
an estimated 70 million members. Ms. Douglass will serve until the
next General Council. The venue and date of that assembly has not
yet been fixed, but it normally takes place every five to seven
years. Boesak was first elected President in 1982 in Ottawa.
   Boesak, an anti-apartheid activist, resigned from the church in
July and said he intended to pursue a political career. He is a
member of the United Democratic Front, an anti-apartheid group.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS INDEPENDENCE IN THE GULF OF OMAN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warplanes
from the Carrier USS Independence have been conducting fighter
missions over the Persian Gulf nightly since a few days after
Iraq's takeover of Kuwait.
   The Independence, accompanied by six ships, reached the area
Aug. 5, three days after the invasion, after breaking off drills at
Diego Garcia, 2,500 miles south.
   Before visiting the Independence, a U.S. Department of Defense
regional media pool was aboard the USS La Salle, flagship of the
Joint Task Force Middle East, in the Gulf.
   Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty, commander of U.S. forces in the
Gulf, said in a briefing that U.S. forces rushed to the region
since the invasion are equipped with protective suits, masks and
antidotes in case of an Iraqi chemical weapons attack.
   Asked if he was worried about chemical weapons, Fogarty said:
``The fact that they do have chemical weapons is disturbing to
everybody throughout the world, but we are a trained force, if they
happen to employ them.''
   On the Independence, Rear Adm. Jerry L. Unruh, commander of
Battle Group Delta, said the battle group's ships also were
equipped to deal with a chemical attack, but that chances of such
an attack were ``very, very slim.''
   Fogarty described the Persian Gulf as ``a tough environment''
because of the high heat and humidity, especially in the summer.
But but said: ``Our forces have met this challenge.''
   He said he would not characterize the Iraqi Air Force as weak,
but added, ``I'll tell you, we're better, that I know.''
   Capt. Robert Ellis, commander of the Independence, said his crew
averaged 18-20 years old and most were on their first deployment.
There are 5,000 people on board the Independence.
   ``For a lot of young people this is their first time away from
home and they are facing these unknowns for the first time,'' he
said.
   Capt. Jay B. Yakeley III, commander of Navy Air Wing 14 aboard
the Independence, said his pilots had had ``no close encounters''
and had not sighted any Iraqi aircraft.
   ``Many of them are combat-tested against Iran, we know that. We
know the type of training they have. They probably have some real
good pilots and some that are not so good.''
   In interviews, several pilots said they were aware that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's air force had many pilots with recent
combat experience in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, and said they were
somewhat familiar with the French-built F-1 Mirages flown by Iraq.
   But they said they were more concerned about the threat of
surface-to-air missles than engaging in aerial combat with the
Iraqis.
   The pilots expressed confidence that despite their own lack of
combat experience, their training and superiority of U.S. aircraft
gave them confidence.
   ``We all feel as if we're ready for it'' said one 23-year-old
ensign who flies the F-18.
   ``Any fighter pilot here feels that he can carry out his mission
better than any Third World nation pilot,'' said another ensign.
   Asked whether American pilots were eager to get into a fight, he
said: ``We're not warmongers out here but we're ready for action
and we want to put our training to good use.''
   Fogarty, who is in overall command of the U.S. forces in the
Gulf and the north Arabian and Red Seas, answers to Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf III, commander in chief of central command.
   He said the military's mission was ``to defend against an Iraqi
attack against Saudi Arabia and to be prepared to conduct other
operations as directed.''
   He said no decision had been made on command structure of the
multinational force, but that the structure ``is being put into
force right now. It is being worked on, it is a matter or
coordination and communications.''
   He refused to say whether U.S. forces would be subordinate to
any non-American commanders.
   Fogarty said he had no intelligence at the time of the briefing
to back up a report by diplomatic sources in Riyadh that Saudi
gunners had fired on two Iraqi reconnaissance planes near Khafji on
Sunday.
   The media pool then flew to the Independence, where another
briefing was held by Unruh. He was asked whether the Navy had
interdicted any oil shipping leaving Iraq or occupied Kuwait.
   ``We have been given no directive to stop any shipping. We are
not on a blockade mission,'' he said. But he said he thought the
Iraqi oil flow ``had pretty much dried up.'' Turkey last week shut
off its oil pipeline, one of three primary outlets used by the
Iraqis.
   The 31-year-old, 80,000-ton ``Indy'' carries 60 to 70 aircraft
made up of seevn types: two F-14 squadrons, two squadrons of the
F-18 Hornet and one of the A-6E intruder, EA-6E Prowler Electronics
Countermeasures Plants, E-2C Hawkeye AWACS, S-3A Vicking
anti-submarine patrol planes and SH-3 Sea King helicopters.
   The F-14 Fighter Gap Missions over the Gulf are to protect the
U.S. Naval Force in the waterway, now totaling nine ships, and to
respond to other missions as ordered, officers said.
   A surface warfare officer in the carrier's combat information
center said the Iranians were putting out P-3 Orion surveillance
plances in the area, ``But they don't get too close. They are very
friendly. We talk to them and they talk to us.''
   The F-14s, equipped with three kinds of air-to-air missiles,
including the highly classified Phoenix, which can hit an opponent
at ``long distance,'' can perform four-hour missions and stay aloft
``indefinitely'' with the support of Air Forces KC-135 and KC-10
tanker planes in Saudi Arabia, Yakeley said.
   The mood of the men aboard the Independence was one of
anticipation that they were about to be part of an important event.
   ``They are glad that their country has made this commitment and
that they're the ones who were picked to be out here on the front
line,'' said one officer.

   Ask what Japan will do next to help in the Iraq
crisis, and the answer is it will observe the Japanese
Constitution, which forbids military activity.
   Ask what Washington wants Japan to do, and the answer is even
more vague. No one is saying, not even whether Washington has put
specific requests to Tokyo.
   These issues go to the heart of Japan's standing in the world
today, its curious mixture of confident wealth and uncertainty of
how to play the role of a big power. What specifically can Japan do
in a heated crisis to back its global partners, the United States
and other big Western democracies? What can it be asked to do?
   The administration of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu left an
impression Monday of tough choices still ahead, so great that Kaifu
postponed a trip to Saudi Arabia and four other Middle East
countries snared in the Iraqi crisis.
   The nub of the issue for Tokyo is that an international military
effort is growing in the Middle East, which is the source of 70
percent of Japan's oil. And Japan steers clear of foreign military
actions, from painful experience a half-century ago.
   Instead of going to the Middle East and showing support for the
countries that oppose Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Kaufu will stay at
home to direct the government through the minefield of deciding how
to back the international force in the Persian Gulf without
violating the constitution.
   Japan is determined to decide on ``concrete measures'' to
support the gulf force, Makoto Watanabe, director of the Foreign
Ministry's Middle Eastern affairs bureau, told reporters.
   Asked repeatedly whether Japan might send military units such as
naval vessels, he stolidly replied, ``We will examine all possible
measures while observing the provisions of the constitution.''
   Kaifu's government already has barred trade with Iraq and Kuwait
and fully supports international economic sanctions to dislodge the
Iraqis from Kuwait.
   The sanctions were a genuine sacrifice for Japan, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said last week. Japan drew 11.2
percent of its oil from Iraq and Kuwait in the first half of this
year. While Japan has 142 days worth of oil in reserve, the
government is expected to authorize modest energy-conservation
measures Tuesday in case the gulf standoff drags on.
   The crisis has knocked 15.12 percent off the closely watched
Nikkei index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The big decline seems to
belie predictions that Japan's economy, growing strongly at more
than 4 percent annually, has a comfortable cushion in times of
crisis.
   Whatever economic sacrifices emerge, the tough decision for the
Japanese government is how far it can go to support a foreign
military effort by its allies.
   Japan's no-war constitution is better suited to a peaceful world
that does not exist. It was imposed by U.S.-led occupation
authorities after World War II.
   The constitution declares that the Japanese people ``forever
renounce war as a sovereign right'' and that armed forces ``as well
as other war potential will never be maintained.''
   After the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, the constitution
was interpreted to mean that Japan could maintain armed forces for
self-defense.
   From there, Japan's defense budget has grown to a limit of 1
percent of gross national product, but there is fierce debate
whenever anyone suggests projecting military force abroad. The
navy, for instance, could have been chosen to protect
plutonium-carrying ships from terrorists. The lower-profile coast
guard was picked instead.
   In 1987, both sides in the Iran-Iraq war attacked oil tankers in
the Persian Gulf. The United States led a multinational task force
to clear the path for oil vital to Japan, but Tokyo decided it
could not send even such a defensive military unit as a minesweeper
to the gulf because of the constitution.
   Instead, Japan financed a navigation system to keep track of
ships in the gulf, extended new loans and a credit line to Jordan
and assumed a bigger share of the cost of basing U.S. troops in
Japan.
   It's most likely that Japan will use money again to back the
gulf crisis force. Other countries will risk manpower and prestige,
and Japan will face accusations of getting a free ride again.

<HEAD>Rising Prices, Mortgage Rates Hurt Homebuyers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rising prices and mortgage rates continued to
undermine the purchasing power of first-time homebuyers in the
second quarter despite increased incomes, a real estate trade group
said Monday.
   And, the National Association of Realtors added, a prolonged
conflict in the Middle East will drive up mortgage rates even
further, adversely affecting not only the entry-level sector, but
the entire housing market as well.
   The Realtors said its first-time homebuyer affordability index
was 72.9 in the April-June period, meaning a typical renter family
with wage earners between 25 and 44 years old had 72.9 percent of
the income needed to qualify for financing to buy a typical starter
home.
   The index measured 73 during the previous quarter. The Realtors'
composite index measuring the affordability of all buyers of
existing homes was 104 during the second quarter, down from 104.3
from January through March.
   The median income of a first-time homebuyer rose $245 to $23,368
in the second quarter. The median income means half of the buyers
earn more, half less.
   However, the typical first-time buyer would need an income of
$32,061 _ $8,693 higher than the median income _ to qualify for
conventional financing covering 90 percent of a home priced at
$81,800, the median starter-home price.
   The Realtors said a first-time buyer would qualify to buy a home
costing just $59,600.
   The starter-home price rose $300 during the second quarter. The
closing interest rate used in the index rose from 10.04 to 10.15
percent including additional fees, or points, paid at settlement.
Private mortgage insurance raised the interest rate to 10.40
percent.
   The changes in price, income and interest rate resulted in a
monthly payment of $668, up $9 from the first-quarter.
   Realtors President Norman D. Flynn said the association expects
mortgage rates to ease if the Middle East crisis ends quickly.
   ``If the crisis is of longer duration, we expect there to be a
significant negative impact on housing markets and affordability,
especially for first-time buyers,'' he said.

   The White House said today its naval barricade
of Iraqi ships is taking hold as the United States and its allies
squeeze Saddam Hussein economically so the Iraqis cannot ``maintain
their war machine.''
   The Bush administration said bluntly today that even food would
be withheld from Iraq. ``You don't give them the essentials that
enable them to carry on the war,'' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said.
   In Saudi Arabia, where American troops are building a massive
defense against any further Iraqi aggression, the acting chief of
staff for U.S. troop operations told reporters, ``I think our
position grows stronger with each day that goes by.''
   As Maj. Gen. Don L. Kaufman spoke, the steady drone of planes
brought more soldiers and hardware to the Saudi desert. Kaufman
said planes were landing virtually every 10 minutes or so with
their military cargo.
   On the economic front, Fitzwater said the sanctions endorsed by
the United Nations are hurting Baghdad.
   ``The purpose of the embargo is to put the pinch of them,''
Fitzwater said in Kennebunkport, where President Bush is
vacationing. ``We assess the impact of the embargo as excellent.''
   He said the White House had ``obvious humanitarian concerns''
about prohibiting food imports into Iraq. But he added:
   ``The purpose of the sanctions and the embargo is to put the
pinch on them. It seems fairly obvious to me you don't let
foodstuffs and other things go in that are subject to the
sanctions. The purpose is not to let supplies go in that allow them
to maintain the war machine, allow them to maintain their
aggressive takeover of Kuwait.''
   Asked about reports that Jordan was allowing Iraqi shipments
through, Fitzwater said, ``We are hopeful that Jordan will comply.
They have said they will abide by the sanctions.''
   Fitzwater also said the White House reported ``two or three
ships in recent hours that have turned away or been turned away or
at least have otherwise not landed with their cargo.''
   An Iraqi tanker tried to dock at a Saudi terminal to take on
oil, but was turned away by Saudi officials, diplomatic sources in
the region reported.
   Bush and his top aides are avoiding the word ``blockade'' to
describe a U.S. decision to use whatever means necessary to choke
off Iraq's oil trade and imports of other goods, including food.
But their intention was clear.
   ``I consider interdiction of shipping to be in accord'' with
United Nations economic sanctions, Bush told reporters Sunday. ``No
point getting into all these semantics. The main thing is to stop
the oil from coming out of there and that is what we're going to
do.''
   Diplomatic sources at the oil terminal near Yanbu, Saudi Arabia,
said the Iraqi tanker al-Qadissiyah, which could carry up to
900,000 barrels of oil, failed in its attempt to moor Sunday night
because three tug boats that normally would help have been taken
out of the water.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the tanker
sailed away today, after its apparent attempt to defy a U.S.
declaration that its warships would enforce a U.N. embargo aimed at
forcing Iraq's Saddam Hussein to give up his forced annexation of
Kuwait.
   Prince Bandar Bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to Washington,
said on ``Good Morning America'' that Saddam should not try to make
the Israeli territories a part of the Kuwait crisis.
   ``He is mixing the issues,'' the ambassador said. ``That is not
an excuse for an Arab country to go an invade another Arab
country.''
   The United States intensified its military fortification of
Saudi Arabia and the surrounding seas over the weekend, sending in
Marine and Army air assault troops and shipping Patriot
surface-to-air missiles and other sophisticated air-deployed
weapons to the region. Sources who disclosed the movements said
Pentagon planners assumed that, in the event of an Iraqi attack, an
initial air battle could be decisive.
   The commander of the U.S. military action, Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf, briefed reporters at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida
on the logistical difficulties of transporting troops and backup
equipment 7,000 miles by air and 12,000 miles by sea. Schwarzkopf
said the Iraqis are ``dug in right now for a strong defense.''
   ``We have built up a great deal of force over there now ... and
if they do make an attack they are going to pay a price for it,''
he said.
   Schwarzkopf said troops would be on guard against terrorists as
well as Iraqi guns and gas. An estimated 50,000 troops are
committed to Saudi Arabia in the initial deployment, with
contingency plans for a force up to 250,000. ``I would never tell
you that the American forces that are there are 100 percent out of
harm's way,'' the general said.
   Indeed, the Pentagon reported the first casualty of the military
action on Sunday. Air Force Staff Sgt. John Campisi, a 30-year-old
aircraft mechanic from Covina, Calif., was klled when he was hit by
a truck on a darkened runway.
   While soldiers took up their stations in the Saudi deserts, the
White House pressed forward with its economic isolation of Iraq.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the United States
would begin ``almost instantly'' to ``take measures that are
necessary and proportionate in order to enforce the (United
Nations) sanctions.''
   Asked if the United States was mounting a naval blockade, Baker
_ appearing on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley,'' _ said:
``Let's simply say that we now have the ability, the legal basis
for interdicting those kinds of shipments.'' He declined to use the
word blockade.
   Bush, vacationing in Kennebunkport, Maine, said the
U.N.-approved embargo ``gave us broad authority, working in
conjunction with others, to do whatever is necessary to see no oil
goes out.''
   Asked if the United States would block shipments of food as well
as oil, the president said, ``Just watch. Everything.''
   The Washington Post today quoted a senior administration
official as saying, ``We will fire on a ship if it won't stop.
We'll do the usual things _ warn them off, fire a shot across the
bow. But if it comes to that, there is no question what we will
do.''
   The U.S. pledge to stop the flow of goods in and out of Iraq
came after Kuwait's exiled leader, Sheik Jaber Alahmed Al-Saba,
asked that the United States take steps to ensure the U.N. economic
sanctions take hold.
   As the Bush administration vowed to quarantine Iraq, Saddam, in
a statement read by a spokesman on television in Baghdad, urged his
people to prepare for hardships that may result from the
international economic sanctions.
   He also linked any Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait to an Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and a Syrian
withdrawal from Lebanon. Israel seized the occupied territories
from Egypt and Jordan in 1967.
   The White House ``categorically'' rejected Saddam's proposals,
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, calling them ``another
attempt at distracting from Iraq's isolation and at imposing a new
status quo.'' Only the unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces
from Kuwait will satisfy the United States, he said.

   An Iraqi circus performer whose
specialty is pulling out car engines with his bare hands left his
French troupe to join the Iraqi army, the circus director said
Monday.
   Zanouk el Habib, 23, returned home because he was worried about
his family and wished to fight if Iraq went to war, said Pierro
Bidon, director of the Archaos Circus.
   Bidon said Zanouk left Aug. 7. He did not know if the Iraqi
national had been reunited with his mother and three sisters, who
live near Baghdad.
   Zanouk is 6-feet-9 and weighs 375 pounds. Bidon said he hired
Zanouk after watching him destroy the interior of a bar in
Barcelona, Spain.
   The director said Zanouk worked as a merchant seaman before
joining the circus, based in southern France.

   Soviet citizens on Monday expressed hope that the
new cooperation between the United States and Soviet Union in the
Persian Gulf crisis will lead to further collaboration.
   ``It seems everyone has finally understood, as they should have
long ago, that only joint efforts can bring something positive,''
said Svyeta Buzenkova, 20, a Muscovite interviewed on Red Square.
   She suggested the two superpowers combine efforts in cultural
pursuits, space research and other areas, and said she believed the
warming relations will only improve.
   ``I think people now are ... finding it more and more
interesting to talk to each other,'' Ms. Buzenkova said.
   Army Lt. Alexander Soldatov said he regretted the years that the
Soviet Union sent millions of dollars in weaponry and military aid
to Iraq. The Kremlin cut off arms shipments after Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``It's too bad that those are our weapons there,'' he said. ``I
wish they had never been sent.''
   After the invasion, Secretary of State James A. Baker III joined
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Moscow for a rare
joint statement condemning the invasion and urging a worldwide arms
embargo on Iraq.
   The Soviet Union has two warships in the Persian Gulf but so far
has declined to join U.S. efforts to interdict Iraqi shipping.
Soviet officials say they would consider participating in a naval
interdiction sponsored by the United Nations.
   Victor Borovik, a retiree who lives in Moscow, praised the
U.S.-Soviet cooperation in the Middle East following decades of
superpower competition in the oil-rich region.
   ``I don't think we should be suspicious any longer of the United
States,'' he said. ``We need to continue to take joint measures to
put out the fire in case of any military conflict.
   ``We need to prevent bloodshed and sit down for talks to resolve
this,'' he said, standing on the sloping drive between the Kremlin
and St. Basil's cathedral. ``But they are aggressors and should be
stopped.''
   Borovik and others echoed their government's cautious approach
to taking military action against Iraq.
   ``Our military absolutely should not get involved in a military
conflict,'' he said.
   ``I hope the Soviet Union uses its best efforts for a peaceful
resolution ...The globe has shed too much blood.''

   Britain and Australia said today they will help the United
States interdict Iraqi shipping, but France said it would not join
the barricade because that would make it a ``co-belligerent'' in
the Persian Gulf.
   The Netherlands said it would send two frigates to the area as a
symbol of solidarity, and Pakistan announced it would send troops
to Saudi Arabia to join thousands of U.S. forces already there as a
defense against Iraqi troops massed in southern Kuwait at the Saudi
border.
   No date for departure or number of troops were given by the
Pakistani Foreign Ministry.
   Earlier today, official Egyptian sources said the first Syrian
ground forces were expected in Saudi Arabia before Tuesday, but
Saudi sources said only that the Syrians are expected this week.
   British Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave announced
this afternoon that sailors would board any vessel attempting to
break economic sanctions against Iraq, imposed in the aftermath of
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of neighboring Kuwait.
   ``If there is evidence of sanctions-busting, the Navy will take
the necessary steps,'' Waldegrave told a news conference.
   The Foreign Office said Britain was responding to a request from
the Kuwaiti government in exile that it take steps to insure the
effectiveness of sanctions authorized last week by the U.N.
Security Council.
   President Bush said Sunday he would use any means necessary to
enforce the United Nations' embargo.
   ``I consider interdiction of shipping to be in accord'' with
U.N. sanctions, Bush told reporters Sunday. Asked if the shipments
of food would be interdicted as well, Bush said: ``Just watch.
Everything.'' Iraq imports about 75 percent of its food, including
basic foodstuffs like rice and meat.
   In Paris, a government spokesman told reporters that a U.N.
trade embargo against Iraq and Kuwait, occupied by at least 130,000
Iraqi troops, does not extend to intercepting shipments of oil by
the government of Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein.
   Any attempt by French warships to stop tankers would make France
a ``co-belligerent'' in the oil-rich region along with Iraq, the
spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Dutch government did not immediately announce whether its
two ships, which may not arrive until September, would interdict
Iraqi shipping.
   ``The Dutch military presence contributes to international
solidarity in discouraging further Iraqi aggression,'' said the
letter from the Dutch cabinet to the Parliament.
   Added a spokesman for British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
``Certainly we haven't mentioned blockade at this stage, or
interdiction.'' He did not rule out a future change in policy.
   Mrs. Thatcher is taking a vacation in England, and her spokesman
in London said he did not know whether she and Bush had discussed
the U.S. plan.
   ``Economic sanctions are indeed the way it should be played
initially,'' the spokesman said, on condition of anonymity. ``I
think the idea of sending our forces down there is very much a
deterrent. The primary bite should be the economic sanctions.''
   A spokesman at Australia's Foreign Ministry did not hestitate to
use the term ``blockade.'' He said, also on condition of anonymity,
that the aim of the naval force was to prevent any supplies going
into or out of Iraq.
   The Soviet Union has two warships in the gulf, but has said it
would consider joining a blockade only under U.N. auspices.
   Vladimir Polyakov, Moscow's new ambassador to Egypt, told
reporters in Cairo that 8,000 economic and military advisers were
in Iraq but none took part in the conquest of Kuwait.
   Three thousand Egyptian soldiers had arrived in Saudi Arabia by
Sunday, the vanguard of a 10,000-member Arab League force,
including Syria and Morocco that the league last week agreed to
send.
   About 1,000 more Egyptian troops were scheduled to arrive today,
the sources said on condition of anonymity.
   Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the U.S. military
effort in the Middle East, said Sunday the deployment of American
forces was running ahead of schedule.
   Up to 50,000 U.S. troops are expected to arrive in Saudi Arabia
in the coming weeks. U.S. officials said as many as 250,000 could
be sent, depending on how the Iraqi threat unfolds.
   Schwarzkopf said American forces are outnumbered by the Iraqi
troops, who continue to pour into Kuwait. The Iraqi occupation
force is estimated at 130,000 to 170,000 men.
   The U.S.-led multinational force and the Arab League force will
apparently be coordinating their operations under the Saudi
military.
   The British frigate HMS Battleaxe also arrived in the gulf
region Sunday, joining the destroyer HMS York and the frigate HMS
Jupiter, the Ministry of Defense said. Three Royal Navy
minesweepers depart for the gulf from Scotland today.
   A squadron of Tornado fighters is in Saudi Arabia, another of
Jaguar warplanes is in Oman, and weapons, spares and equipment have
been flown to the gulf in Hercules transport planes, the Ministry
of Defense said.
   The United States already has nine ships in the gulf, seven in
the Mediterranean, and aircraft carriers and their battlegroups in
the Red Sea and Indian Ocean.
   Canada, Denmark and West Germany have also committed ships.
   In Ankara, Turkey, Parliament on Sunday gave the government
permission to declare war and send troops into combat if Turkey is
attacked. Turkey has moved squadrons of jet fighters to bases near
the Iraqi border.

<HEAD>North Sea Oil Workers Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers at 70 North Sea oil installations went on
a 24-hour strike Monday, their fourth work stoppage in 11 days.
   A spokesman for the Offshore Industry Liaison Committee, which
seeks recognition as a union and improved safety standards, said at
least 7,000 workers were participating.
   Two oil companies hit by the action said the number of strikers
was much lower. British Petroleum said 76 of 1,435 workers at 19 of
its installations walked out. Shell U.K. said 200 of its 2,000 oil
workers did so.
   The oil companies said production was not affected.
   A total work stoppage would affect 10,000 workers on 100
platforms. British workers in North Sea oil operations are members
of assorted unions, and the Liaison Committee wants to represent
all of them.
   Nearly 400 workers were continuing an 11-day-old sit-in at
Shell's Brent Field in the East Shetland basin. They are refusing
orders to return to shore, said Keith Clyne, a spokesman for the
Liaison Committee.
   He said 2,000 men had been fired for participating in work
stoppages since the strikes began Aug. 2.
   A spokesman for the Offshore Contractors' Council said claims of
poor safety conditions were a ``media gimmick.''
   ``This industry this year will spend 750 million pounds ($1.4
billion) on safety enhancements,'' he said. ``Safety is taken
extremely seriously.''
   The world's worst oil platform disaster occurred in the British
North Sea in July 1988, when an explosion and fire at the Piper
Alpha platform killed 167 men. A helicopter crash that killed six
oil workers July 25 was the latest of several aircraft accidents in
the oilfields over the past four years.

<HEAD>In Desperate Move, Palestinians Support Saddam Hussein</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied lands are
celebrating President Saddam Hussein of Iraq as a savior who can
win back the West Bank and Gaza Strip and restore Arab pride by
teaching the Americans a lesson.
   The euphoric support for Saddam has replaced the widespread
despair gripping Palestinians since Middle East peace efforts broke
down and their 32-month uprising against Israel lost momentum.
   It also has united the PLO _ already closely allied with Saddam
_ and Moslem fundamentalist factions that have been at each others'
throats during the uprising.
   Pro-Saddam sentiments reached near-frenzy Monday, a day after
Saddam said he would only consider pulling out of Kuwait if Israel
withdrew from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Thousands marched in pro-Saddam rallies in the West Bank and
celebrated him as a national hero who would deliver by force what
diplomacy failed to achieve.
   In the West Bank's largest city, Nablus, some 2,000 people
chanted ``Saddam, we are with you until victory!'' and waved Iraqi
flags and posters of the leader. In the town of Jenin, about 1,000
marchers urged Saddam to attack Israel with chemical weapons.
   Leading pro-PLO activists said the outbursts are a measure of
the frustration over failed peace efforts. They blamed the United
States for not forcing its close ally, Israel, to make a deal with
the Palestinians and give up occupied land.
   ``People here are frustrated that there is no solution to their
plight. That explains their enthusiastic support for somebody who
might find that solution,'' said Radwan Abu Ayyash, head of the
Arab Journalists Association in the occupied lands.
   ``The Palestinians are anti-American, not pro-Saddam,'' Abu
Ayyash told The Associated Press.
   He said Americans applied a double standard by demanding Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait while accepting Israel's continued
occupation of territories won in the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``People are wondering why the Americans are suddenly Rambo in
the Persian Gulf, and where was Rambo in 1967,'' Abu Ayyash said.
   Faisal Husseini, another leading pro-PLO activist, said Saddam
has given Palestinians new hope by linking Israeli and Iraqi
withdrawals.
   ``If there is one way to solve our problem, it is through
Saddam's initiative. It would solve all problems of international
legitimacy in the area,'' Husseini said.
   Many Palestinians said the Persian Gulf crisis is the final blow
to efforts by Secretary of State James A. Baker III to broker peace
talks between the Israelis and Palestinians.
   Husseini once tentatively backed the Baker plan, which called
for preliminary talks in Cairo to discuss an offer by Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir to hold elections in the occupied lands.
   But he said Shamir's refusal to accept the Baker plan has forced
the Palestinians to give up.
   The Palestinians' support for Saddam, meanwhile, closed one of
the few channels of communication between Israelis and Palestinians.
   Israeli doves from the Labor Party, led by elder statesman Abba
Eban, decided Sunday to suspend all meetings with Husseini and
other leaders until the Palestinians denounce Saddam.
   ``My colleagues and I cannot possibly have a fruitful discussion
with Palestinians who applaud the brutality of Saddam,'' Eban said
in a telephone interview.
   Doves from Labor and other left-wing parties have been meeting
regularly with Palestinian leaders to find common ground for peace
negotiations.
   Officials in Shamir's government said they were not surprised by
the Palestinians' pro-Saddam stance.
   Shamir's government views the new Palestinian militancy as proof
the PLO cannot be a partner in negotiations. It also reduces U.S.
pressure on Israel to launch peace talks.
   Among the Palestinians, meanwhile, there were only a few voices
warning against support for Saddam.
   ``The Palestinians are now sitting in Saddam's boat. If the boat
sinks, you can say goodbye to the Palestinians,'' said Zuhair Dubi,
a respected pro-PLO journalist and mosque preacher from Nablus. ``A
defeat of Saddam will set the Palestinian cause back for decades.''
   Palestinian economist Hisham Al Khatib warned that the wealthy
gulf states, angered by the Palestinian position, may fire many of
the estimated 800,000 Palestinians working there, and throw them
out.
   Hundreds of Palestinians, who were vacationing in the West Bank
at the time of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, have already been
barred from returning to their jobs in Saudi Arabia, Abu Ayyash
said.
   Palestinian workers in the gulf send about $250 million a year
to relatives in the West Bank and Gaza. If the funds dry up, it
would be a serious blow to the Palestinian economy, already badly
shaken by the uprising.
   But the warnings are not dampening the euphoria, which has
quickly assumed religious overtones.
   Moslem fundamentalist groups have stirred up emotions by calling
for a jihad, or holy war, against U.S. forces deployed in Saudi
Arabia. The Moslems compare the Americans to the Christian
Crusaders who invaded the Holy Land in the 11th through 14th
centuries before being defeated by the Arabs.
   ``We call on Iraq to attack the heart of Tel Aviv if Iraq is
attacked by the Western crusaders,'' said a leaflet distributed
Monday in the Gaza Strip by the fundamentalist group Hamas.
   The Islamic Supreme Council, the highest Moslem authority in
Jerusalem and the occupied lands, called on all Arabs to send money
and weapons to Iraq to fight the ``U.S. conspiracy against Islam.''

   Rebel leader Charles Taylor agreed today
to meet with Gambian leader Sir Dawda Jawara to discuss West
African calls for a cease-fire in Liberia's civil war. It was the
first time Taylor agreed to such talks.
   Taylor's maneuver will likely delay deployment of a five-nation
West African task force mobilizing in neighboring Sierra Leone. The
force was expected to move into the besieged Liberian capital of
Monrovia this week to force a truce in the war.
   Taylor earlier said his troops would fight any peacekeeping
force.
   Also today, about 200 foreigners, including one American, left
Monrovia to rendezvous with U.S. Marine helicopters in Buchanan,
the rebel-held port about 90 miles southeast of Monrovia.
   More than 200 Marines from warships off the Liberian coast were
airlifted to Monrovia on August 5 to evacuate Americans and protect
U.S. installations. Washington has said they would not intervene in
the war.
   On Sunday, President Samuel Doe reversed an earlier promise to
step down by October and said he wants to stay in office for at
least a year after the regional force moves in to halt the
fighting. Taylor has repeatedly demanded Doe's immediate
resignation.
   A communique from the rebels said Taylor accepted an invitation
from Jawara and would meet him in Banjul, the Gambian capital. The
communique was issued at Taylor's headquarters in Harbel, 35 miles
east of Monrovia.
   The communique said Taylor also would talk with Nigerian leader
Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, Ghana's Flt. Lt. Jerry Rawlings and Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni, who is current chairman of the
Organization of African Unity.
   ``It is the president's (Taylor's) considered view that ECOWAS
(Economic Community of West Africa) has a role to play, and (there
is) an even wider one for the OAU,'' the statement said. ``He is
convinced that a meaningful solution can be worked out.''
   Leaders of the Economic Community of West Africa decided last
week to send troops to halt the 8-month-old civil war that has left
at least 5,000 people, mostly civilians, dead.
   The force will include troops from Ghana, Gambia, Guinea,
Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Lt. Gen. Arnold Quainoo of Ghana is
commander in chief of the West African force.
   At least 18 civilians were killed Sunday when government
soldiers attacked rebels trying to take an airport.
   Also Sunday, three Western news agency reporters were detained
and beaten by government soldiers who threatened to shoot them as
spies after they crossed through rebel lines. Among the reporters
was Michael Goldsmith, 68, of The Associated Press.
   The reporters were brought under guard to Doe's heavily
fortified mansion, where they were released and met with a
government spokesman, who apologized for the soldiers' actions.
   The rebels have accused Doe of corruption and human rights
abuses during his 10 years in power. Two rebel groups, one led by
Taylor and the other by Prince Johnson, together control most of
the nation's territory.
   Doe's statement that he will remain in office reverses an
earlier offer he made in May to resign before elections scheduled
for October.
   Doe's insistence on remaining in power will also go against West
African leaders' plans to install an interim government in Liberia
to organize free elections. The West African plan bars any of the
warring parties from participating in the interim government.
   Rival rebel leader Prince Johnson has agreed to the West African
plans. Johnson has also said he is not interested in leading
Liberia, while Taylor has appointed a rebel government of which he
is president. Taylor said he is opposed to holding elections in the
country for four or five years.

   Several thousand Sudanese shouting
anti-American slogans marched through Khartoum on Monday in support
of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and demanded the withdrawal of
foreign troops from Arab lands.
   The demonstrators marched to the American Embassy, where they
handed an unidentified embassy official a memorandum protesting the
U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia.
   ``Down, down U.S.A., go away C.I.A.! Shame on your American Arab
agents! Strike strike Saddam! Forward, forward Saddam!'' chanted
the demonstrators, carrying pictures of the Iraqi president.
   They then marched to the Iraqi Embassy and handed an embassy
official a memorandum of support.
   It was the second pro-Saddam, anti-American demonstration in
Khartoum since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   At an emergency Arab summit held in Cairo, Egypt, on Friday,
Sudan expressed reservations about sending Arab troops to protect
Saudi Arabia and other gulf countries from an attack by Iraq.
   Sudan's military ruler, Omar Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir, met Monday
with PLO chief Yasser Arafat. At the Arab summit, the PLO also
expressed reservations about deploying Arab troops to the gulf
region.
   ``The United States is determined to escalate the crisis,''
Arafat said upon his unexpected arrival in Khartoum.
   El-Bashir said he and Arafat discussed ``the continuation of
efforts to find a solution for the crisis following the failure of
the recent Cairo Arab summit to find an outlet from the explosive
situation in the gulf.'' He warned that the present situation could
have ``dangerous consequences.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush will break off his
vacation Tuesday to return to Washington for two days of briefings
on the crisis in the Persian Gulf and on the budget deficit, the
White House said today.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the embargo
against Iraq was holding and he defended the U.S. plan to cut off
even food shipments, saying the United States does not want to feed
Saddam Hussein's ``war machine.''
   On Americans held in Iraq and Kuwait, Fitzwater criticized Iraqi
reports that foreigners were free to leave Kuwait as Iraq had
claimed. ``We now have cars lined up at the Saudi border who are
unable to get out,'' said Fitzwater.
   Earlier in the day, Bush telephoned the president of Venezuela
to discuss the crisis and world oil production.
   Bush plans to return to his oceanfront summer home Wednesday
after a military briefing and speech to Pentagon employees,
Fitzwater said.
   Bush arrived in Maine Friday for a scheduled 25-day vacation,
but said then that the standoff in the Middle East would probably
require him to go ``back and forth'' to the White House.
   Fitzwater, briefing reporters at a seaside hotel near Bush's
Walkers Point home, said Bush will leave for Washington around
noontime Tuesday and meet with his top advisers on the budget and
efforts to forge a deal with leaders of Congress on reducing the
deficit.
   Bush will hold a news conference to discuss the budget problems
after his session with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, budget
director Richard Darman and others, Fitzwater said.
   He will go to the Pentagon Wednesday morning for a full briefing
on the military situation in the Gulf, where Bush has sent an
estimated 50,000 troops, squadrons of fighter jets and a large
flotilla of ships to defend Saudi Arabia and pressure Saddam to
withdraw his occupying army from Kuwait.
   The United States is leading international efforts to enforce
United Nations-ordered economic sanctions against Iraq, which has
100,000 or more troops massed in Kuwait.
   ``We assess the impact of the embargo as excellent,'' Fitzwater
said.
   He said the embargo covers food imports as well.
   ``The purpose of the embargo is to put the pinch on them'' so
the Iraqis cannot ``maintain their war machine,'' Fitzwater said.
   Pressed on whether the United States would impose a total
quarantine on shipping through the Gulf of Aqaba, Fitzwater said he
did not want to ``telegraph our intentions.'' But he added, ``I
think when the president said yesterday `Everything,' that that was
quite inclusive and adequate to give notice as to what our
intentions are.''
   Later, Fitzwater issued a written statement saying the United
States would not try to intercept medical supplies to Iraq. ``We do
not intend to go beyond the (U.N.) resolution,'' said Fitzwater,
who quoted language from the resolution stating the embargo does
not include ``supplies intended strictly for medical purposes.''
   Bush called Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez today to
discuss the Gulf situation and world oil supplies, Fitzwater said.
U.S. officials have said Venezuela, a member of OPEC, is stepping
up oil production to help offset the cutoff of Iraqi and Kuwait oil.
   On the embargo, he said, ``To our knowledge ships are not
arriving. The embargo is being maintained. The nations of the world
are abiding by their commitments. We have had two or three ships in
recent hours that have turned away or been turned away or at least
have otherwise have not landed with their cargo. We are very
optimistic at this point that the embargo will hold.''
   Asked about reports that Jordan was letting shipments through,
he said, ``we are hopeful that Jordan will comply. They have said
they will abide by the sanctions.''
   Asked why the United States would block food shipments,
Fitzwater said, ``We have obvious humanitarian concerns but we have
also very real military concerns and this is a force that is after
all threatening many countries of the world. It is a leader who has
killed people by his own hand and by his own forces.''
   ``We are very much concerned about the safety about our soldiers
and our troops in Saudi Arabia and concerned about the other
countries of the region,'' he added.
   ``The purpose of the sanctions and the embargo is to put the
pinch on them. It seems fairly obvious to me you don't let
foodstuffs and other things go in that are subject to the
sanctions. The purpose is not let supplies go in that allow them to
maintain the war machine, allow them to maintain their aggressive
takeover of Kuwait. You don't give them the essentials that enable
them to carry on the war,'' said Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater had no estimate of what it is costing to keep the
American forces in Saudi Arabia. There have been reports from
Pentagon sources that it will cost $300 million or more a month.
   Fitzwater expressed skepticism about such figures, but said,
``Funding will not drive this operation.''
   The White House announced Sunday that after a written plea from
Kuwait's exiled emir to enforce United Nations economic sanctions,
``the president has decided that the United States will do whatever
is necessary'' to isolate Iraq.
   Bush was on the telephone before dawn Sunday discussing the
international effort to isolate Iraq with Syrian President Hafez
Assad, often a target of U.S. criticism but in this case an ally.
   Fitzwater said ``the United States categorically rejects''
Saddam's proposals for withdrawing from Kuwait.
   The Iraqi leader demanded an end to the international sanctions
that have choked off his oil exports, plus a pullout of American
and other forces, and an Israeli surrender of the occupied
territories on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Saddam, who has unleashed chemical weapons in the past, warned
that ``many will be burned'' if war erupts in the region.
   Bush, asked during a golf outing if he was pleased that Saddam
at least was talking about negotiating, said crisply, ``I didn't
see anything ... pleasing in there at all _ none. Nothing.''

<HEAD>Americans, Soviets Discuss Legal Systems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and his
Soviet counterpart, Justice Minister Veniamin Yakovlev, on Monday
began a week of discussions on American and Soviet legal systems.
   The meetings between Justice Department officials and the Soviet
delegation headed by Yakovlev are a follow up to discussions
Thornburgh had in Moscow last fall.
   As part of perestroika, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has
expressed an interest in developing a legal system that relies on
due process rather than arbitrary decisions of bureaucrats.
   Soviet officials are seeking advice from American legal experts
on a number of issues. Among them is the development of a uniform
commercial code, which is seen by Western experts as a necessary
prelude to more foreign investment in the Soviet Union.
   In opening remarks, Yakovlev said the attorney general's visit
to Moscow last fall ``opened a totally new page'' in the history of
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``It's very important that our jurists and our lawyers work
closely together,'' he said.
   Yakovlev said the Soviet concept of the rule of law ``is not so
different'' than American thinking. But he acknowledged that ``our
juridical systems differ quite a lot.''
   The Soviets are particularly interested to ``understand how
legislative actions regulate economic functions,'' Yakovlev said.
``This is very pressing for us.''
   Thornburgh's remarks sounded a note of U.S.-Soviet solidarity
during the current Mideast crisis.
   ``In this period of stress in the Mideast, it seems particularly
significant that our two countries stand shoulder-to-shoulder in
the opposition of the naked aggression and the support of the rule
of law through the United Nations and other international bodies,
Thornburgh said.
   The Soviet delegation will meet with the various division heads
at the Justice Department.
   On Tuesday, Yaklovlev and Thornburgh will travel to Lake George,
N.Y., to address the Conference of U.S. Chief Justices.

   A happy event is imminent, but even though it's
at the zoo no one expects the stork to deliver this bundle of joy _
he or she will weigh about 200 pounds.
   Bozie, an 5,740-pound Asian elephant, is in her 20th month of
pregnancy and delivery isn't long off, say officials at the Lincoln
Park Zoo.
   ``We have a thousand things to prepare for,'' said Mark
Rosenthal, the zoo's curator of mammals. ``We want to get a viable,
healthy baby on the ground.''
   Bozie's little one will be only the 16th of its species born in
the United States since 1985, and the first for Chicago and the
Lincoln Park Zoo. Only 10 of those calves have survived.
   Officials surveyed zoos all over the world for information about
elephant pregnancies. As Bozie's pregnancy progressed, keepers
began taking her measurements and weighing her.
   They even built a new room for the delivery where Bozie, who has
gained 800 pounds during her pregnancy, sleeps away from the zoo's
other elephants.
   A suburban Northbrook horse veterinarian who knows how to
perform a Caesarean section on an elephant plans be on hand during
the birth in case of complications.
   ``We're all excited,'' Rosenthal said. ``But we're keeping it
calm until we see that we have a successful birth. Then we'll
probably get real excited.''
   The zoo had to go to a lot of trouble to get Bozie in a family
way, since it has no male elephants.
   Bozie was sent to Dickerson Park Zoo in Springfield, Mo., where
she and a male elephant named Onyx hit it off. Bozie was returned
to the Lincoln Park Zoo after a one-year stay in Missouri.

<HEAD>``Miss Saigon'' Furor Draws Derisive British Press Comments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British press is reacting derisively to the
refusal by an American actors' union to let the star of the musical
``Miss Saigon'' repeat his performance on Broadway.
   Film director Michael Winner, writing in The Sunday Express,
decried the ``insane decision'' of Actors' Equity to deny Welsh
actor Jonathan Pryce permission to headline the hit musical on
Broadway.
   Pryce won an Olivier Award, London's equivalent of a Tony Award,
for playing the Eurasian pimp known as ``The Engineer.'' He has
appeared on Broadway twice before, winning a Tony in Trevor
Griffiths' ``Comedians'' in 1976.
   Actors' Equity said last week that since ``The Engineer'' is a
Eurasian, an actor of Asian descent should play the role.
   This prompted producer Cameron Mackintosh to threaten to cancel
the Broadway production, which has a record advance sale of almost
$25 million. The show, a London sellout since September, was to
start New York previews in March at the Broadway Theater.
   The issue is expected to be reviewed at a meeting of Actors'
Equity this week.
   ``This decision took (protectionism) to new extremes,'' said
Winner, who has doubled as an actor. He added: ``My roles in
America now seem limited to playing middle-aged Jews.''
   Winner, a Briton, is middle-aged and Jewish.
   Sunday Telegraph columnist Oliver Pritchett wrote sarcastically
that the union's logic meant sharing ``the plum parts around all
the ethnic communities.''
   He envisioned several newly titled musicals, including ``Noh,
Noh, Nanette,'' ``Hello Bali,'' and ``The Rocky Harare Show'' to
employ Japanese, Javanese and Zimbabwean actors.
   The Peter Tory column in The Daily Express asked: ``Should the
role of the Mikado ... now only be taken by Japanese grandees
dwelling within the shadows of Mount Fuji?''
   ``The implication of the American ban leads to endless
silliness,'' he wrote.
   The Daily Mail wrote: ``This exclusion illustrates the terrible
confusion into which this once great melting-pot of a country has
descended over the issue of race.''
   Reporting on the casting of American actor Richard Gere as a
Japanese-American in a forthcoming film, The Evening Standard
headlined the article, ``When equity means double standards.''
   Not everyone agreed.
   Rhoda Koenig, an American columnist in The Independent on
Sunday, wrote: ``Could Mackintosh's high-minded political stance
have been a clever move to get public opinion on his side before
the opening and present himself as the underdog rather than the
exploiter?''
   ``The greatest irony ... is that Americans are being whipped up
to get behind a show that presents a tawdry, simplistic version of
their involvement in Vietnam,'' she added.

   The Justice Department said today that the
decision whether to retry Mayor Marion Barry on unresolved drug and
perjury charges will be up to U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens.
   Stephens ``does not need our permission to retry a case,'' said
Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian, when asked if the
department would participate in the decision. Stephens hasn't yet
said whether he plans to retry the case.
   The mayor, meanwhile, returned to work today on a fulltime basis
for the first time since his trial began in June.
   Barry was convicted of one misdemeanor count of possession of
cocaine on Friday by a jury that acquitted him of another simple
drug count but deadlocked on 12 other charges, including three
felony perjury counts.
   After a mistrial was declared, Stephens said he would decide by
Sept. 17 whether to retry the unresolved drug possession and
perjury charges.
   Eramian said that Justice Department officials in the criminal
division stood ready to give Stephens advice _ if sought _ about
how to proceed with the Barry case. But the spokesman said the
department will not offer unsolicited views on what to do next.
   ``That is the U.S. attorney's call,'' Eramian said.
   So far, ``there have been no discussions with main Justice''
about the case, said Eramian. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
``has not been involved in the case so far in any way, shape or
form,'' he said.
   Barry also planned to drop his Democratic party affiliation
today as he weighs whether to run for city council as an
independent, aides said Sunday. Barry, who announced in June he
would not seek re-election this fall, believes a run for the city
council will let him keep a hand in local political affairs, aides
said.
   On Saturday, the mayor said in a speech, ``Now is the time for
healing.'' He asked city residents to ``forgive me for any hurt I
may have caused ... I hope that any of you who still harbor
resentment and vengeance can let go.''
   Barry also said of the trial jury, ``Let their judgment be our
last judgment.''
   In his speech, the mayor acknowledged he had been ``behaving in
ways that were not in keeping with the vows I made to my wife'' and
said he had sought and received Effi Barry's forgiveness.
   Regarding his treatment for alcohol and prescription drug abuse,
he said, ``There's no shame or disgrace in being addicted to
anything. The shame and disgrace is in not making the decision to
seek help.''
   Barry has been receiving conflicting advice on whether he should
run for city council, said aides who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Monday is the deadline for switching parties. If Barry becomes
an independent, he would have to gather the signatures of 2,000
registered city voters to be placed on the ballot. He would compete
for two city-wide council seats with winners of the Republican,
Democrat, and Statehood party primaries.
   Winning a council seat would allow Barry to maximize his future
city pension earnings and let him stay active in local politics,
which he has dominated since he was first elected mayor in 1978. He
was elected to the city council in 1974.
   Sources said that while some aides believe Barry has been
exonerated and should resume his political career, others are wary
of antagonizing Jackson or prosecutors.
   ``The feeling is, `Don't do anything to draw attention to
yourself,''' one associate said.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has not yet set a
sentencing date for Barry's misdemeanor cocaine possession
conviction, which carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison
and a $100,000 fine.
   Stephens has said only that the trial evidence will be reviewed
before he decides whether to retry the 12 charges, but politics
have been intertwined with the case since Barry's Jan. 18 arrest in
the FBI sting. During plea bargain negotiations, the mayor has
said, Stephens insisted that Barry would have to resign his office
as part of any agreement with the government.
   Meanwhile, a Washington Post survey published Sunday showed that
while most of those interviewed believe the government should
abandon its prosecution of the mayor, a similar percentage believed
Barry should not seek office this year.

training mission to Saudi Arabia and now acting chief of staff for
Central Command Forward _ the command operations for U.S. troops.
   ``The Saudi government has been extremely cooperative,'' Kaufman
told a pool of reporters at a briefing Monday, adding that he
thinks the Saudis were surprised by the size of the American
commitment.
   ``They are finding that we are not going to allow a handful of
Americans to be in harm's way. The numbers are larger, I think,
than the Saudis originally anticipated,'' he said.
   President Bush ordered about 50,000 American troops to Saudi
Arabia last week at the request of the Saudi government following
Iraq's lightning seizure of neighboring Kuwait. Pentagon sources
have said the number could climb as high as 250,000 in coming
months.
   Kaufman said he was aware of no military incident between the
Saudis and Iraqis.
   ``As far as I know it has been very stable,'' said Kaufman.
   Reporters in a Pentagon pool arrived in Saudi Arabia on Monday
and were allowed to interview U.S. soldiers. Under the pool
conditions, the names of the soldiers, details of the military
equipment and the name of the air base where the interviews took
place could not be disclosed.
   Dozens of military transport planes, vehicles and equipment had
already arrived at the base. U.S. forces and equipment were
arriving at several places in the kingdom and moving on to various
positions, officials said.
   A 27-year-old sergeant from Claymont, Del., in a support unit
from Fort Bragg, N.C., said he had just arrived on a plane
chartered from Federal Express and was told to be ready to stay
four to six months.
   ``I called my wife and told her I might be called on, and if I
go, just pray we all get out of here safe,'' said the sergeant, who
had a gas mask attached to his belt. ``Yes, it's scary, you have to
build up the courage and put the fear aside and do what you have to
do.''
   At Torrejon Air Force base in Spain, where the press pool
stopped for refueling, the tarmac was lined with rows of C-141 and
massive C-5 transport planes and a wing of F-16 fighters, some
carrying Sidewinder missiles. All apparently were headed for the
Persian Gulf region.
   A huge hangar was filled with cots so the troops can catch a
nap. Volunteers from the local church handed out drinks and baked
goods.
   One young soldier, shortly after stepping off a C-5 transport
plane, said he had little training for desert or chemical warfare.
   ``So _ should I think I'm coming back?'' he asked. ``I'm pretty
scared.''

   Gardner L. Bridge, 83, an Associated Press
newsman in Washington and New York for 40 years, died Monday.
   Bridge died at Arlington Hospital of an intestinal obstruction,
his family said.
   As a reporter in The Associated Press' New York City bureau,
Bridge covered such stories as the final gang wars of the
prohibition era, the Lindbergh kidnapping, the S.S. Morro Castle
disaster and the investigation of Mayor Jimmy Walker's
administration.
   In Washington, Bridge covered the Senate and was assigned to
every national political convention from 1944 to 1968.
   While riding the Thomas E. Dewey campaign train in 1944, Bridge
and several others were injured in a train wreck at Castle Rock,
Wash. Dewey was not injured.
   Bridge was born Nov. 2, 1906, in Stockbridge, N.Y., and grew up
in Syracuse, N.Y.
   He began his career with The Associated Press in 1925 as a Morse
code operator. At the same time, he attended classes at Columbia
University's Graduate School of Journalism.
   He took a job as a reporter for the Albany Evening News in 1928
and went on to cover the state legislature for the newspaper.
   Bridge returned to The Associated Press in New York in 1931 as a
reporter and later became city editor and bureau chief.
   He transferred to Washington in 1942 and retired in 1971.
   Bridge is survived by two daughters, Vivian Bridge of Reston and
Regina Steele of Fairfax; two grandchildren and one great grandson.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete Monday.

<BYLINE>Massage Spurs Growth in Cocaine-Exposed Premature Infants, Study
Says
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Daily massage can speed up the growth of premature
babies who were exposed to cocaine in the womb, a study says.
   As a result, the babies were able to leave the hospital about
four days earlier on average than non-massaged premature infants,
researcher Tiffany Field said Monday.
   Faster-growing babies also become more responsive, which
promotes interaction with parents, she said. Other research shows
that parental involvement helps a child's development in the first
year of life, she said.
   Fetuses are exposed to cocaine when a pregnant woman uses the
drug. Such use raises the risk of premature birth.
   Field is a professor of pediatrics, psychology and psychiatry at
the University of Miami Medical School. She reported preliminary
results from the study at the annual meeting of the American
Psychological Association, and discussed it in a later interview.
The meeting concludes Tuesday.
   The study, still in progress, has so far produced data on 16
infants. They were born about 10 weeks before their due dates,
weighing about 2.6 pounds.
   They had to stay 20 days to 30 days in a neonatal intensive care
unit. Normally, such children then require about 20 days in the
hospital simply to gain enough weight to be discharged, Field said.
   The massage program took place during this latter period.
   Infants were massaged with firmness, Field said. ``They love it
when you give them a little pressure,'' she said.
   The routine included 10 seconds of working over the top of the
head and down to the neck, and then 10 seconds going the other way,
she said.
   Also massaged were the neck and shoulders, back, legs and arms.
The chest and abdomen were avoided because the infants obviously
did not like being touched there, perhaps associating it with
painful medical procedures, Field said.
   After five minutes of massage, the babies' arms and legs were
moved about for five minutes, and then came five more minutes of
massage.
   The 15-minute sessions were done three times a day for 10 days.
   The massaged babies gained 28 percent more weight per day after
the treatment than a comparison group of 16 premature infants who
had also been exposed to cocaine, but who were not massaged, Field
said.
   The difference appeared around the sixth day of the treatment
and continued for at least a few days after it ended, when
researchers stopped keeping track, Field said.
   Nobody knows why massage spurs growth, but perhaps it stimulates
release of hormones that aid absorption of food, she said. Prior
studies of premature babies have shown simply holding or paying
attention to them did not cause them to gain weight, Field said.
   The massage treatment looks promising, said a prominent
pediatric researcher, Dr. T. Berry Brazelton of Cambridge, Mass.
   But he cautioned that ``it has to be done with sensitivity to
the baby's condition and responses.''
   The massager must ease up in response to signals from the
infant, he said.
   Massage had already been shown to speed up the growth of
premature infants not exposed to cocaine, Field said.
   In one study, a 10-day course of daily massage spurred weight
gain by 47 percent. The massaged infants were able to leave the
hospital six days sooner, saving substantial sums of money in
health care costs, Field said.
   About 10 percent of births in the United States are premature,
amounting to 350,000 a year, according to the March of Dimes Birth
Defects Foundation.
   Most premature infants weigh less than 5.5 pounds at birth.
About 15 percent to 20 percent of premature infants die in the
first month after birth.

<HEAD>29th Anniversary of Berlin Wall Marked in Joint German Ceremony</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flowers were laid beside a cross honoring a
teen-ager who was slain trying to escape to freedom as Germans from
East and West on Monday marked the 29th anniversary of the Berlin
Wall.
   The ceremony, the first joint memorial of the Aug. 13, 1961,
construction of the Berlin Wall, included a prediction by a local
politician that the scar left by the crumbling barrier will never
end.
   East German Defense Minister Rainer Eppelmann demanded criminal
probes of those responsible for the shoot-to-kill orders at the
wall under the former Communist regime.
   Eppelmann said the now-ousted Communist officials must be
brought to justice ``in a fair way.''
   Communist border soldiers killed 80 East Germans making dashes
for freedom at the wall, while hundreds of others were caught and
imprisoned for trying.
   Germans are engaged in an emotional debate over whether the
soldiers themselves should be brought to trial.
   ``The open wound is closing,'' said prominent West Berlin city
councilor Erich Paetzold at the ceremony. ``But a scar will last
forever.''
   He spoke beside a rough-hewn cross erected in memory of
18-year-old East Berlin worker Peter Fechter, who was shot and bled
to death while trying to escape in 1962.
   His death has come to symbolize the bitter separation that
followed the collapse of Nazi Germany after World War II.
   East Germany's Communists suddenly started erecting the wall,
stunning the world 29 years ago, to halt the flow of refugees to
the West.
   Paetzold said a part of the wall will be preserved ``so that we
don't forget what happened here, so that no one forgets what
happened here.''
   Despite Paetzold's promise, it may be difficult to find a
suitable memorial site.
   Many of the most famous stretches of the wall have been torn
down since last fall's reforms swept East Germany and other
countries in Eastern Europe. Other sections have been hacked away
by entrepreneurs and souvenir-hunters.
   East German and West German newspapers were filled with
recollections of the wall Monday.
   They included a picture of the wall's mastermind, Erich
Honecker, shown talking to East German troops the month after the
wall was built.
   Honecker ruled East Germany for 18 years before his ouster last
October.
   Honecker, 77, is under investigation for possible murder charges
stemming from the deaths of those who tried to flee to the West.
   On Nov. 9, Honecker's desperate successors opened the wall in
hopes of halting another exodus that already numbered 200,000.
   East Berlin's democratically elected mayor, Tino Schwierzina,
reminded the 300 listeners at Monday's ceremony that the Berlin
Wall caused widespread suffering.
   ``The situation in the German Democratic Republic makes this
increasingly clear,'' Schwierzina said. ``We who are living behind
the almost disappeared wall need quick and effective help.''
   Schwierzina said the nation's economy was in ``catastrophic''
condition.
   East German demands for money from Bonn have led to tensions
between the two countries as they head into the last stretch before
unification, scheduled for December at latest.
   The representatives of the two halves of Berlin spoke at a cross
set up in honor of Fechter after his Aug. 17, 1962 death.
   Fechter bled for nearly an hour before his body was hauled away.
   ``Here where Peter Fechter died, we can feel how much suffering
the wall caused,'' said the East Berlin mayor.
   A weathered photograph of the young man lying in agony is tacked
to the cross' dark wood. More than a dozen large flower
arrangements were placed by the cross.
   Although the wall has disappeared there, windows on the Eastern
side still have the bars that kept people from jumping to freedom
from nearby buildings.
   In years past, the Communist East Germans marked the wall's
anniversary with bombastic military parades that drew the wrath of
the Western Allies.
   More than 2.5 million East Germans fled to the West from 1949
until the wall went up.
   Communist border soldiers killed more than 200 people attempting
to flee from East Berlin or other parts of East Germany to the West.

   A sales tax increase to build a Denver baseball
stadium steps up to the plate Tuesday in Colorado's primary
election.
   Voters will also chose between Josie Heath and Carlos Lucero for
the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate. Republican state Sens.
Wayne Allard and Jim Brandon are vying for the 4th Congressional
District seat.
   Democrat Gov. Roy Romer faces no opposition in the primary. His
GOP opponent, John Andrews, also is unopposed.
   Secretary of State Natalie Meyer projected a turnout of about 35
percent of the state's 1.8 million eligible voters.
   Voters in six Denver metropolitan-area counties will decide
whether a sales tax of 0.1 percent should be levied to raise $139
million over 12 years to build a baseball stadium.
   Denver is bidding for one of two baseball franchises to be
awarded this year by the National League. Baseball proponents hope
approval of the stadium tax question will lure a major-league team.
   Weekend polls showed voters about evenly split on the issue.
   Opponents have said the tax would amount to a public subsidy of
private business, and they have noted that no potential owners of a
Denver major-league franchise have yet stepped forward.
   Heath, 52, a former Boulder County commissioner, led Lucero in
polls published over the weekend that showed her lead ranging from
59-21 percent to 41-32 percent.
   Lucero, 49, a lawyer, had made an aggressive assault on the
savings and loan scandal the centerpiece for his campaign in recent
weeks, hoping to overcome a 2-to-1 Heath lead in June.
   The winner will meet U.S. Rep. Hank Brown, R-Colo., who is
vacating his 4th District seat after 10 years to run for the
Senate. Sen. Bill Armstrong, R-Colo., is stepping down.
   Most polls show Brown would easily beat either Heath or Lucero
in the Nov. 6 general election.
   Allard and Brandon are vying for the right to succeed Brown in
the 4th District. The winner faces the Democratic nominee, state
Rep. Richard Bond of Greeley, who is unopposed Tuesday.

   Late last month, 350 officers
at U.S. Central Command Headquarters in Florida held a training
exercise _ a hypothetical crisis requiring American military action
in the Middle East.
   According to a spokesman, the drill code-named ``Internal Look
`90'' was devised by Central Command's chief, Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf III, to ``test our ability to deal with a contingency
in which a threat overflowed its banks and challenged the interests
of the United States.''
   Five days later, Iraqi president Saddam Hussein's armed forces
rumbled into neighboring Kuwait, and people around the Tampa
headquarters were asking whether ``the bear,'' as Schwarzkopf is
called, had known something they didn't.
   ``It's almost exactly the scenario of IL `90,'' said Capt.
Ronald Wildermuth, chief spokesman for the 56-year-old Schwarzkopf.
Schwarzkopf took over in 1988 as commander of U.S. military affairs
in the explosive region stretching from North Africa to Pakistan.
   Schwarzkopf, a West Pointer with four stars, a master's degree
in guided missile technology and the build of a pro football
tackle, is no stranger to crisis.
   He was second-in-command of U.S. forces in the Grenada invasion
in 1983. A decade earlier, he led an infantry battalion during the
bloodiest phase of U.S. involvement in Vietnam.
   Schwarzkopf himself was wounded twice and won three Silver Stars
for valor and a host of other medals. But he was probably best
known for his personal involvement with the family of a soldier
killed by errant American artillery _ an episode described in the
book and film ``Friendly Fire.''
   While none of that has made H. Norman Schwarzkopf III a
household name, the name was already famous in the early 1930s,
when Col. H. Norman Schwarzkopf led the controversial investigation
of the Lindbergh baby kidnapping.
   The elder Schwarzkopf subsequently turned up as a U.S. Army
colonel in Iran, where he organized a national police force that
helped thwart a Soviet-backed communist insurgency at the end of
World War II.

   The Trade Ministry asked Japanese on Monday to work
in sweltering offices and use mass transit to prepare for a
possible oil crisis because of the Persian Gulf situation.
   About 70 percent of Japan's oil comes from the Middle East.
   Trade officials are proposing wide-ranging measures for
government agencies, private companies and individual households to
conserve energy.
   The proposals, expected to be approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday
and take effect immediately, include setting office building
thermostats no lower than 82 degrees and reducing office lighting
by one-third.
   ``The situation is not yet so serious because Japan has a very
large petroleum reserve,'' said a trade official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``But we ought to be better prepared for
the possible worst-case scenario.''
   Individual citizens will be encouraged to use public
transportation. People who continue to drive will be asked to go no
faster than 50 mph on highways.
   Although the proposal does not call for penalties to be imposed
for failing to comply with the measures, government guidelines
generally are widely followed.
   The trade official said the ministry also decided on stricter
measures to be implemented if the country's oil reserves, now
estimated at enough for 142 days, deteriorate.
   Those steps would include limiting both gas station operations
and late-night television broadcasting, officials said.
   ``We are trying to be cautious not to repeat the panic of the
second oil crisis in 1978,'' the official said, referring to the
oil crunch caused by the outbreak of the war between Iran and Iraq.
``The confusion occurred because we were not too well-prepared back
then.''

   An adventure-loving traveler from India
thinks the United States is a fascinating place, and can't
understand why Americans themselves don't see more of it.
   Satish Ganapathy and two coworkers from India plan to ride
90,000 miles through 37 states in 90 days on two old, Indian-made
motorcycles.
   ``We cannot see any place else like this on Earth,'' Ganapathy
said. ``This is a fun-filled country. There are so many things to
see.
   ``We have heard that many people in the United States have not
seen their own country, which is very saddening. We've seen every
nook and cranny of India. Here, people do not know their own
country.
   ``If I lived in Harrisburg I would have seen the rest of the
United States before I was 35.''
   The chance that their two motorcycles could break down adds to
the thrill.
   ``We believe in adventure,'' Ganapathy, 40, told The
Patriot-News in Harrisburg while visiting last week. ``We may find
that we may fail physically, or the motorcycles may fail. We do not
know.''
   Ganapathy, Stanley Rose, 28, and Arun Khadse, 32, workers at an
Indian power plant, set out from New York City on July 28.
   They'll cross the hot Texas flatlands and challenge California's
jammed freeways. They'll visit Yellowstone National Park, the Grand
Canyon, the nation's Capitol and Disneyland.
   The trip, which their employer helped sponsor, already has
thrilled them. They've toured Independence Hall and marveled at the
size of the enormous chocolate factory in nearby Hersey.
   And the chandeliers in Donald Trump's Taj Mahal casino in
Atlantic City, N.J., were magnificent, even though the building
hardly looks like its wondrous namesake in India, they said.
   ``You could spend 10 days in that casino,'' Ganapathy said.
   The best thing has been the way strangers have treated them,
they said.
   While staying two days at the home of a friend's cousin in Lower
Paxton Township, the three men went for a walk and an American
couple said ``Hello.''
   That rarely happens in their home town of Bombay.
   ``Even if they don't know you they say `Hello' to you,'' Rose
said. ``Back home, if I don't know you I don't say anything to you.
People are very warm here.''

<HEAD>Dissident Claims 450 Killed in Lhasa in March 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Chinese functionary claims that security
forces killed more than 450 Tibetans in the capital of Lhasa in
1989, the Observer newspaper reported.
   The Chinese government has reported that about a dozen people
were killed on March 5 and March 6 of last year, the newspaper said
in its Sunday edition.
   The Observer's report was based on films an documents supplied
by Tang Daxian, a former Chinese journalist now living in Paris.
   It said Tang had a copy of a report from the Public Security
Bureau and the Tibet Military District Command dated March 11,
which said that by then, ``387 Lhasa citizens have been killed ...
the majority by bullets ... 721 were injured, 2,100 have been
arrested or detained ... 354 have disappeared ... 82 religious
people have been killed, 37 injured, 650 arrested or detained.''
   Tang, 36, was in Tibet representing the Chinese Journalists'
Association, the State Council, the United Front Department and
other government offices, the newspaper said.
   Tang said he left Beijing in May 1989 after being warned that he
might be arrested for furnishing high-level information about
government deliberations to demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
   The Observer said Tang's father, Tang Hai, once headed the Tibet
section of the United Front Department, which supervises
non-Communist organizations.
   Tang said Chinese authorities were alarmed when a Tibetan flag
was flown above the Jokhang temple in Lhasa on Feb. 7, 1989, and
the crackdown culminated in the bloodshed of early March.
   Tang said police in Lhasa received these orders from their
commander in Beijing, Gen. Li Lianxiu: ``The special task force
should immediately produce 300 people dressed as ordinary citizens
and monks. They are to cooperate with the plain-clothes police to
complete the task of creating a provocative atmosphere along the
Barkhor (central market) on the morning of 5 March. Their tasks
are: to burn down the Darshing prayer pole on the northeast of the
Jokhang temple; to destroy and ransack the granary in Chenguan
district, provoking citizens to steal the grain, and provoking
people to rob the Tibet-Gansu Commerce Corporation of its goods.''
   On March 5, Tang said, police dressed as civilians set the
Darshing prayer pole on fire, and police shot and killed eight
people among an outraged crowd that gathered.
   Tang said police operations were suspended in the afternoon
because of foreign witnesses.
   On March 6, Tang said, most foreigners in Lhasa had been
isolated in a hotel. He said police made an advance, but retreated
under a barrage of stones. He said Tibetans charged after them with
sticks and bricks, straight into an ambush set up by police firing
automatic weapons from rooftops.
   Tang claimed that 300 people were killed in the first 10 minutes.

<HEAD>Mideast Nations Well-Armed With U.S. Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mideast is bristling with billions of
dollars worth of modern weapons, much of the arsenal provided by
the United States. That includes Kuwaiti missiles now in the hands
of Iraq.
   Many of the arms transfers to the Mideast have been financed by
low-interest, long-term U.S. loans. Israel, at nearly $1.9 billion
this year, and Egypt, at almost $1.3 billion, are the world's
biggest recipients of such aid.
   Other nations, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, pay cash for
U.S. weapons.
   Both the aid program and the cash sales are aimed at supporting
friendly governments in the region and assuring the free flow of
oil.
   That overriding interest caused President Bush to dispatch U.S.
military forces to the Persian Gulf last week to shield oil-rich
Saudi Arabia from the threat of an attack by Iraq, which overran
Kuwait Aug. 2.
   Pentagon officials say that while the United States sold arms to
Kuwait only infrequently, its arsenals included some U.S. Hawk
anti-aircraft missiles and several thousand U.S. Tow anti-tank
missiles. All are now believed to be in Iraqi hands.
   Most of Kuwait's fighter aircraft, including two squadrons of
French-built Mirage F-1s and several dozen American Skyhawk
warplanes, are believed to have been flown to safety in Saudi
Arabia.
   Before it was attacked, Kuwait had arranged a $1.8 billion
purchase of U.S. FA-18 fighter aircraft plus anti-ship and
anti-aircraft missiles.
   But the aircraft were not scheduled for delivery until 1992 and
a Pentagon official, who asked not to be named, said that if Kuwait
remains in Iraq's control the United States has no obligation to
deliver them.
   Over the last 20 years, just $1.5 billion in U.S. weaponry was
transferred to Kuwait, a small fraction of the arms sent to other
Mideastern nations.
   Saudi Arabia has been the biggest customer for U.S. arms, with
$23 billion in deliveries over that period. Israel has received $11
billion in weapons; Egypt, $6 billion.
   Washington has sold Saudi Arabia much of its modern weaponry and
is helping that nation modernize its military capability.
   Shortly after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the United States
acted to dismantle congressional obstacles to arms deliveries to
Saudi Arabia.
   Defense Secretary Richard Cheney waived a legislative
restriction limiting to 60 the number of sophisticated F-15
warplanes Saudi Arabia is allowed to have. The Pentagon official
said the Saudis will now be allowed to have 70 F-15s.
   The Saudis previously made a $3 billion purchase of U.S. TOW
anti-tank missiles, which are now being produced, the official
said. Last year, the Saudis bought 320 M1A2 tanks, which have yet
to be built, for $3 billion.
   Major Saudi arms deals this year include more than $1 billion
for the modernization of the oil-rich kingdom's national guard and
another $1 billion to modernize the Saudi fleet of AWACS
early-warning aircraft.
   In Israel, the United States is trying to improve that nation's
defensive capability through a naval modernization program, which
includes the construction of submarines, the Pentagon official said.
   Israel is also developing and recently tested the Arrow defense
missile, which is designed to destroy incoming missiles. Eighty
percent of the cost of the program is being borne by the United
States.
   Egypt has become a major recipient of U.S. military aid since it
became the first Arab nation to recognize Israel in 1979. Egypt is
now buying Harpoon anti-ship missiles.
   More modest U.S. aid, mostly in the form of military training
and basic gear, is provided to Jordan _ $47.8 million this fiscal
year _ and to other countries in the Middle East.
   For the next fiscal year, the Bush administration has asked
Congress for permission to make $4.3 million in arms-sales loans
for U.S. allies in the Mideast.

<HEAD>Bush Lifts Limit on Soviet Business People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, in a bid to bolster
U.S.-Soviet trade, on Monday lifted a long-standing ceiling on the
number of Soviet business people permitted to live and work in the
United States.
   Until now, only 69 Soviets were allowed to reside in America
while pursuing business deals. Now there will be no limit.
   Bush called upon Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to match his
move with ``reciprocal improvements in the climate for American
business in the U.S.S.R.''
   He also cautioned the Soviets against trying to slip in spies on
the pretext of doing business.
   ``This action is taken as an expression of our policy to build a
more normal economic relationship with the Soviets,'' Bush said in
a statement issued from his vacation home here.
   It is ``consistent with our interest in expanding business
contacts and trade with the U.S.S.R.,'' he said.
   ``We have made clear to the Soviets that we retain the right to
reconsider our decision should there be evidence that this
opportunity is being misused for intelligence gathering or other
inappropriate activities,'' the president said.
   Bush proposed closer economic ties with the Soviets at the Malta
summit last December, and he and Gorbachev signed a trade agreement
in Washington in June during their second summit.
   Bush noted that the United States is eager to provide the
Soviets with expertise on how to make lasting market-oriented
reforms in their ailing economy.
   ``Our business people in the U.S.S.R. and Soviet business people
here play an important role in this process. The time has come to
eliminate obstacles to commercial presence in both of our countries
and to allow the number of resident business people to grow in
tandem with the expansion of our economic relations,'' Bush said.

   A fire knocked out power to hundreds of offices
in the city's financial district today, disrupting stock market
trading and stranding hundreds of people in skyscraper elevators,
authorities said.
   Consolidated Edison officials issued an urgent appeal for other
customers to reduce electrical usage because of the danger other
parts of the system would become overloaded. Temperatures in the
city were in the middle 80s.
   Eight firefighters were taken to area hospitals suffering from
smoke inhalation, chest pains and burning sensation in their
throats, officials said.
   The New York Stock Exchange remained unaffected by the outage,
spokesman Ray Pellechia said. But officials at the American Stock
Exchange, New York Mercantile Exchange and Commodity Exchange said
they had to halt trading for the day.
   The fire at Con Ed's Seaport substation was reported shortly
before noon, said Fire Department spokeswoman Marilyn Bernard.
   Hundreds of people were stuck in elevators at the World Trade
Center for up to 2{ hours, said D. Joy Faber, a spokeswoman for the
operator of the twin 107-story skyscrapers. By 2:40 p.m., people
were evacuated from all but one elevator. The complex was operating
on emergency power.
   ``My legs are buckling. I feel so sore,'' secretary Ethel Levine
said after walking down 33 floors.
   More than 100 firefighters, including a decontamination and
hazardous materials unit, were on the scene.
   ``It's very, very heavy smoke conditions,'' Bernard said, with
``power losses all around.''
   Earlier reports of possible PCB contamination were unfounded. A
spokeswoman for the city environmental department said records show
there were no PCB's used at the electrical substation where the
fire occurred.
   Con Ed spokesman Dan Walden said some high voltage cables were
knocked out by the fire. Initially only 500 customers were affected
but two other feeder cables became overloaded and were also knocked
out, causing the blackout to spread, he said.
   A Con Ed customer can be an entire building, so the number of
people affected is many times higher than the number of customers.
The blackout area includes Wall Street and several large office
skyscrapers.
   Beekman Downtown Hospital was operating on emergency generator
power, said spokeswoman Maureen Flatley. She said lights are being
shut off to conserve power and the air conditioning was shut off.
   Concern that continued electrical usage by others would overload
more cables and spread the blackout prompted an emergency plea for
cutbacks.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately known. Some subway
trains were either being halted north of the blackout area or
rerouted to other lines, the Transit Authority said.

   Half the American public fears the Iraqi
conflict will create an oil crisis in the United States, with
rising prices and long lines at the service station, an Associated
Press poll has found.
   Respondents to the national survey overwhelmingly blamed the
recent surge in gasoline prices on oil company greed, not the
Middle East tensions. But many foresaw true shortages and still
higher prices in the next few months.
   Despite those fears, and despite widespread expectations of a
U.S.-Iraq war, the poll found strong support for the use of U.S.
troops to defend Saudi Arabia against possible Iraqi attack.
Sixty-four percent voiced approval.
   The survey of 1,004 adults was conducted Wednesday through
Sunday, after President Bush's announcement he was sending troops
and Iraq's announcement it was annexing Kuwait, which it invaded
Aug. 2.
   Several polls since Bush's speech have found Americans rallying
to his side. Support for the use of U.S. troops has ranged from 63
percent in a poll conducted Tuesday and Wednesday to 81 percent in
a one-day poll Wednesday night.
   Support for Bush personally is roughly as high. Seventy-seven
percent in a poll Friday to Sunday by ICR Survey Research Group
generally approved of the way he has been handling the situation.
And two-thirds said his reaction has been ``about right,'' rather
than too tough or too weak.
   Concerns underlie the support, however. In the AP poll, also
conducted by ICR, 33 percent said the United States is ``very
likely'' to become involved in a war with Iraq. An additional 39
percent called war ``somewhat likely.''
   Approval of the U.S. troop commitment varied among some groups
in the population. Republicans were more supportive than were
Democrats and independents _ 74 percent, compared with 61 and 63
percent, respectively.
   College-educated Americans also were more supportive of the use
of U.S. troops. And most strikingly, women were far less supportive
than men of the troop commitment, 51 percent to 79 percent.
   Beyond his aid to Saudi Arabia, Bush has said Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait ``will not stand.'' But poll respondents were less clear on
that outcome: Just one-third expected an international economic
embargo of Iraq to succeed in forcing it out of Kuwait.
   And many did not favor a military alternative. Thirty-five
percent backed the use of U.S. troops to try to push Iraq out of
Kuwait, and even fewer _ 27 percent _ favored bombing Iraqi
military targets to force it from Kuwait.
   On oil, 86 percent said oil companies were taking advantage of
the situation when they raised gasoline after Iraq attacked Kuwait;
just 6 percent called the increases legitimate, with the rest
unsure.
   But 52 percent said they believe the situation in the Middle
East is likely to create real oil shortages in the next few months,
with rising prices and long lines at the service stations.
   The AP poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3
percentage points. ICR, of Media, Pa., is part of AUS Consultant
Cos.

   Salvage crews sucked up oil from the Houston Ship
Channel on Monday after the third large oil spill in as many months
in or near the busy shipping channel.
   The Coast Guard said at least 21,000 gallons of oil spilled
Sunday when a barge buckled at a dock owned by Lyondell
Petrochemical, a former Arco Petrochemical subsidiary that was spun
off as an independent company. The barge was being loaded with fuel
oil.
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Rex Prosser said crews contained the spill
within a few hours and by Monday morning had transferred the
barge's remaining 609,000 gallons of oil to another barge.
   The salvage crews ran into difficulties Monday.
   ``The major problem is that the oil is sitting on the bottom of
the water,'' said Prosser, chief of Houston port operations.
``We're trying to bring in some underwater dredges to remove the
oil from the bottom of the turning basin.''
   Lyondell spokesman David Harpole said salvage crews used
high-pressure water sprays to help with the cleanup.
   ``Water is being sprayed into the channel to generate some
turbulence to push the oil into the shore where the vacuum trucks
and skimmers can get to it,'' Harpole said.
   Coast Guard officials said the spill area was surrounded by
refineries and other industrial plants, so concern about the
environment is minimal.
   The 295-foot barge owned by Ingram Barge Co. of Nashville
buckled at midship, creasing the center of the vessel and spilling
oil from both sides.
   Crews put temporary patches over a 2-foot fracture on the
barge's starboard side and a 3-inch split on its port side.
   Prosser blamed human error for the spill.
   ``They were loading the barge and the tankermen put too much
weight _ it was a very heavy cargo _ in the two center tanks, and
it caused the barge to buckle,'' Prosser said.
   On Friday, the Coast Guard completed a nearly two-week cleanup
of a 700,000-gallon oil spill that happened July 28 when a Greek
tanker collided with two barges under tow in the ship channel.
   On June 8, the Norwegian tanker Mega Borg spilled 3.9 million
gallons of Angolan crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico off Galveston
when an explosion ripped the vessel, killing four members of the
crew and injuring 17 others.

   Kidnappers in south Lebanon today freed
Swiss hostage Elio Erriquez after 10 months' incarceration and
handed him over to Syrian officials, Red Cross officials said.
   Erriquez was to be taken tonight to Damascus by the Syrians so
he can be turned over to the Swiss Embassy and returned home, Red
Cross officials here said. He was the second Swiss hostage released
since last week.
   Earlier today, the Palestinian Revolutionary Squads said it
released Erriquez, a 24-year-old orthopedic expert, but gave no
details, causing confusion in the Mideast and at home.
   Red Cross chief delegate Artur Bisig said he had been awaiting
confirmation of the reported release. And in Geneva, neither the
Swiss Foreign Ministry nor the International Committee of the Red
Cross had been able to confirm the release.
   But with the latest release, 14 Westerners remain hostage in
Lebanon, including six Americans.
   The first Swiss captive, Emanuel Christen, 33, was released by
the same group Wednesday. Both hostages were working with a Red
Cross clinic near Sidon when they were kidnapped.
   The group's announcement today was delivered to a Western news
agency along with a photograph of Erriquez, showing him
clean-shaven and wearing a white T-shirt.
   The group said the Swiss hostages were freed in response to
efforts by Syrian president Hafez Assad, Algerian President Chadli
Bendjedid, and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   The statement also paid ``particular tribute to Mustafa Saad for
efficient role to ensure a success'' of the latest release. Saad
heads a leftist Sunni Moslem militia that has governed Sidon since
the outbreak of Lebanon's civil war in 1975.
   Saad had told reporters Saturday Erriquez would be freed soon.
   Erriquez and Christen were kidnapped Oct. 6 by masked gunmen
near a Red Cross center for artificial limbs in Sidon, the
provincial capital of South Lebanon, 40 miles south of Beirut.
   On Wednesday Christen was handed to the command of Syrian
peacekeeping troops in Lebanon. He was then taken to the Swiss
Embassy in the Syrian capital of Damascus and flew home the next
day.
   Police had blamed the abductions on Fatah-Revolutionary Council,
a radical guerrilla group led by Palestinian terrorist mastermind
Abu Nidal. The group disclaimed any involvement in the affair.
   The Palestinian Revolutionary Squads said in today's statement
it has no connection to Abu Nidal's group or any other Palestinian
guerrilla faction.
   In addition to six Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, an
Irishman and an Italian are believed held in Lebanon. Longest-held
is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East Correspondent for The
Associated Press. Anderson was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   On Sunday, a senior Shiite Moslem leader in Beirut appealed for
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to release 15 Shiite Moslems
imprisoned for the bombings of the U.S. and French Embassies in
Kuwait.
   The release of the imprisoned men has long been a key demand by
Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, a Shiite group that holds
American hostages Anderson and educator Thomas Sutherland.
   ``The 15 reportedly have been moved to Baghdad and they should
be freed,'' said Hussein Musawi, who heads a pro-Syrian wing of the
fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, an umbrella for several
hostage-holding factions.

   Britain and Australia joined the U.S. effort to
cut off all shipping from Iraq on Monday, while Pakistan pledged to
send troops to protect Saudi Arabia from invasion by Iraq.
   The Netherlands announced its ships would sail to the Persian
Gulf to enforce economic sanctions but would not say if this
included participation in U.S. efforts to interdict Iraqi shipping.
France and Belgium, which both sent ships to the region, also
remained noncommittal on whether they would take part in the
U.S.-led force.
   A well-informed French source said any attempt by French
warships to stop Iraqi oil shipments would make it a
``co-belligerant'' in the region. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said
no decision had been made.
   The aircraft carrier Clemenceau, guided-missile cruiser Colbert
and supply ship Var on Monday were headed for the Suez Canal,
French defense sources said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said American forces
in the gulf would intercept Iraqi oil to enforce a U.N. embargo
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. President Bush said
Sunday he would use any means necessary to enforce the embargo.
   In London, Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave said
British sailors would board any vessel attempting to break the
embargo. ``If there is evidence of sanctions-busting, the navy will
take the necessary steps,'' he told a news conference.
   The Foreign Office said it was responding to Kuwaiti requests
for help by ensuring the effectiveness of the U.N.-authorized
sanctions.
   Three British minesweepers left Scotland on Monday for the
eastern Mediterranean, and C-130 Hercules transport planes were
flying to Saudi Arabia and Oman, using a Royal Air Force base in
Cyprus as a staging post.
   Twenty-four strike aircraft and 1,000 British servicemen are
also being sent to the region under ``Operation Granby,'' the
largest military deployment since Britain's war with Argentina in
the Falklands.
   Frantic work was under way to prepare the aircraft for combat in
desert conditions, defense ministry sources said.
   The Dutch government announced Monday that it would dispatch two
frigates to the gulf around Aug. 20, but it did not immediately say
whether the warships would participate in the multinational cutoff
of Iraqi shipping.
   Belgium was sending two minesweepers and a support vessel to the
Mediterranean. The Belgian Cabinet said it had not decided whether
to integrate the Belgian contingent into the U.S.-led multinational
force.
   Australia's Foreign Affairs Department spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said his country was behind the U.S. effort.
   ``We are part of a force to enforce the United Nations Security
Council sanctions on Iraq,'' he said. The spokesman said it will
take the Australian vessels three weeks to reach the gulf.
   Pakistani leaders agreed Monday to send an undisclosed number of
troops to Saudi Arabia after a series of high-level meetings with
the Saudi deputy foreign minister.
   The Foreign Ministry in Islamabad said up to 150,000 Pakistanis
are believed to be in Iraq and Kuwait, most of them oil workers.
   Iraq's ambassador, Ismail Hamoodi Hussein, told Pakistan's
state-run news agency Monday that Pakistanis in Iraq ``have no wish
to leave, but they are free to leave whenever they want.''
   Between 1983 and 1987, Pakistan stationed 5,000 soldiers in
Saudi Arabia under an agreement between the two nations, a defense
ministry spokesman said. The agreement expired in 1987.
   Pakistani soldiers would join 3,000 Egyptian troops already in
Saudi Arabia. The Egyptians are the vanguard of a 10,000-strong
Arab League force to include Syria and Morocco.
   Up to 50,000 U.S. soldiers are expected to arrive in Saudi
Arabia in the coming weeks and U.S. officials have said up to
250,000 troops could be sent.
   Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the U.S. military
effort in the Middle East, said American forces are outnumbered by
the Iraqi occupation force, estimated at between 130,000 and
170,000 men.
   The U.S.-led multinational force and the Arab League force were
expected to coordinate their operations under the Saudi military.

   It's now up to the judge to decide whether
subliminal messages exist on an album by the British heavy metal
band Judas Priest and, if so, whether such messages drove two fans
to enter a suicide pact.
   Lawyers for the band and CBS Records deny the claim in the case
before Washoe County District Court Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead.
   ``There were unique circumstances there for Raymond Belknap and
James Vance which did not include subliminal stimuli,'' defense
attorney Suellen Fulstone argued. ``Hundreds of thousands of people
have listened to this album with no adverse effect.''
   The youths reportedly made a suicide pact two days before
Christmas 1985 after drinking beer, smoking marijuana and listening
to the 1978 album ``Stained Class'' repeatedly.
   Belknap, 18, held a sawed-off shotgun in his mouth and died from
a single blast Dec. 25, 1985. Vance, then 20, sought to do the
same, but only blew away the lower part of his face.
   Horribly disfigured, he fathered a child and lived for three
years before dying on Thanksgiving Day 1988, of complications from
his injuries and a reaction to medications.
   The lawsuit claims subliminal phrases on the album _
particularly ``do it'' _ tout suicide and pushed the youths over
the edge.
   Subliminal messages _ defined as being below the threshold of
consciousness and apprehension _ supposedly take effect
subconsciously by repetition.
   Band members and defense lawyers maintain the purported ``do
its'' are a combination of a huff of breath by lead singer Rob
Halford and the sounds of drums and guitars.
   ``All the court has to do is listen,'' Ms. Fulstone said.
``There are no `do its' on this album.''
   The judge, who heard the case without a jury, gave no indication
of when he might rule in the case, but some believe it may be as
early as this week.
   The defense argued during the four-week trial that alcohol and
drug abuse, family violence and trouble with the law predestined
the youths' fate.
   Ken McKenna and Vivian Lynch, representing the youths' families,
asked the judge for upwards of $6.2 million in damages for pain and
suffering.
   Ms. Lynch, representing the Vance family, sought between $4
million and $5 million, in part to compensate the family for nearly
$500,000 in medical bills.
   McKenna asked for $1.2 million on behalf of Belknap's family.

<DATELINE>ABOARD USS INDEPENDENCE IN THE GULF OF OMAN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Navy
pilots honing their skills for a possible clash with Iraq say their
biggest worry is not Baghdad's combat-seasoned air force, but its
array of Soviet-made surface-to-air missiles.
   Since this 80,000-ton carrier with about 70 warplanes arrived
off the Arabian Peninsula on Aug. 5 as part of the massive buildup
of foreign forces in the region, some of its pilots have been
flying nightly ``CAP'' or combat-air-patrol missions over the
Persian Gulf.
   Their job is to help screen the nine U.S. warships in the gulf,
and several thousand American ground troops sent to man positions
around airfields and several key sites along the coast of Saudi
Arabia.
   In interviews with reporters who visited the Independence as
members of a Pentagon news media pool, the pilots said they have
yet to encounter any Iraqi aircraft and are never closer than 200
miles to Iraq.
   That leaves them well out of range of Iraq's formidable arsenal
of anti-aircraft guns and missiles.
   Standard military references say Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's forces have more than 300 surface-to-air missile
launchers of at least eight different types. Most are
Soviet-designed.
   Some date back to the 1960s when North Vietnam shot down scores
of American raiders with missiles like the radar-guided SAM-6,
which has an 11-mile ceiling.
   Iraq also has the SAM-9, SAM-13 and SAM-14, all of them medium
or short range _ two miles to six miles. They are designed to
pursue the infrared ``signature'' of a speeding jet. Iraq also has
the ROLAND, a French-designed SAM.
   Some of the missiles were used in the war with Iran, but with
limited effect as Tehran's force of U.S.-built warplanes was
depleted by age and a shortage of spare parts.
   In the interviews, Independence combat pilots said they
respected their Iraqi counterparts for their war experience, but
doubted they would challenge the superior American aircraft and
training.
   ``I have a hard time thinking they'd want to do that. They have
a lot of experience and not many of us have been in combat, but
we're not Iran either,'' said one pilot of an F-18 Hornet
fighter-bomber.
   Said another 29-year-old Hornet pilot, ``I do feel that our
biggest threat to losing aircraft to the Iraqis is from their SAM
platforms, as opposed to their air-to-air (fighters),'' he said.
   A senior commander, who like the others could not be identified
by name under the terms of the interviews, said there were
relatively few ``dog-fight'' encounters in the gulf war and those
that did occur were probably ``chance encounters where neither guy
got more than one shot.''
   He said the speed and armament of the F-14 Tomcats flying the
patrol missions gave them a clear edge over Iraq's French-built F-1
Mirage fighters.
   Although some sailors grumbled about the tension of waiting for
something to happen, the carrier's crew of some 5,000 seemed
generally in high spirits.
   Capt. Robert L. Ellis Jr., commander of the Independence said
his crew, most of whom are 18 to 22 years old, ``weren't thinking
about combat,'' when they embarked on their current tour of duty at
San Diego on June 23.
   ``But now they have a sense of pride that their country has
responded and they are the ones on the front line,'' Ellis said.
   In addition to the fighters on patrol missions, other aircraft
thunder constantly off the carrier's steam catapults on aerial
refueling sorties and night landing practices.
   Small groups of pilots observe and evaluate their colleages as
the gray jets roar in at maximum power against the wind to catch a
tail-hook on one of the four arresting tables stretched across the
deck.
   Most make it the first time, but occassionally one overshoots
the cables and screams off again, hook scrapping the bare deck in a
great shower of sparks.

   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank,
responding to complaints from senior citizen advocates, defended
his agency's policy of refusing to automatically forward nursing
home residents' mail when they move.
   But Frank said in a letter to Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., released
Monday that he was disturbed by reports that well-traveled nursing
home residents' mail was being left behind.
   ``I understand you are aware of places where improper mail
forwarding has caused a hardship for nursing home residents. I am
very concerned with such reports and can assure you the Postal
Service is committed to resolving any problems which may exist,''
Frank said.
   The Postal Service and the Senate Special Committee on Aging
have agreed to collaborate on a campaign to ensure that nursing
homes are re-addressing the mail of residents who have left, the
committee said. Also, Frank said the agency has formed an internal
committee to determine if policy changes are needed.
   Because all residents of a nursing home are at the same address,
the Postal Service says the home should be the agent for their
mail. The mail is delivered in bulk _ like at prisons, hotels and
summer camps _ and distributed by the institution.
   While other people may submit change-of-address cards to local
post offices, nursing home residents must rely on the institution
to write their new address on individual letters. Then, the post
office delivers it at no extra charge.
   Heinz, the Aging Committee's ranking Republican, questioned the
policy in a March letter to Frank, and a Florida elderly-rights
advocate told Congress that some mail was not being forwarded and
the policy ``treats nursing home residents like they were in jail
or something.''
   But Frank defended the policy as ``cost-effective and
practical.''
   ``Single point delivery permits management of the nursing home,
with specific knowledge of each residents' needs and condition, to
properly handle their mail and complete delivery at the best time
and in the most appropriate manner,'' Frank said.
   Allowing residents to file address forwarding cards would mean
postal employees sorting mail would need a record of each person in
the home, Frank said. He said that is not practical because of high
resident turnover.
   Also, some incapacitated residents might have problems obtaining
and completing a change-of-address card, Frank said.
   Heinz was reviewing Frank's letter, said aide Isabelle Claxton.
   In the meantime, Claxton said the Postal Service has agreed to
cooperate with the Senate panel in writing to more than 10,000
nursing homes certified by the federal government under Medicare
and Medicaid. The letters will explain to homes their obligation to
ensure that mail is forwarded.

<HEAD>Pakistan Reports Border Skirmish; India Denies It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>

   Indian soldiers tried to capture a
mountain outpost, starting a firefight with Pakistani soldiers
along the cease-fire line dividing disputed Kashmir, Pakistan said
Monday.
   India denied a battle took place.
   The Defense Ministry said the attack on a remote outpost in the
Himalayas occurred Sunday, the day after talks on easing border
tensions adjourned. It claimed there were Indian casualties, but
did not say how many.
   Earlier Monday, a Foreign Ministry spokesman reported no
progress in the talks, which adjourned without a definite date for
resumption.
   India, a predominantly Hindu country, and Moslem Pakistan have
been uneasy neighbors since their creation in the 1947 partition
that ended British colonial rule.
   Tensions have been heightened by a Moslem separatist uprising in
India's part of Kashmir.
   ``The war threat has never receded,'' said an official of
Pakistan's Defense Ministry, who cannot be identified under
briefing rules. ``This could be an isolated incident or it could
lead to escalation.''
   Indian soldiers used artillery, anti-tank guns and mortars in
attacking the outpost 60 miles northeast of Muzzaffarabad, capital
of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, and were driven off with mortar
fire after about an hour, the Defense Ministry said.
   ``Our forces repulsed the attack and inflicted casualties on the
intruders,'' one official said.
   In New Delhi, an Indian government spokesman said: ``It's not
true. We have not attacked. We have not used any artillery. We have
not suffered any casualties.''
   He also cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   Skirmishes and small arms fire are frequent along the
U.N.-monitored line in Kashmir, over which the two nations fought
wars in 1948 and in 1965.
   The attack was reported to U.N. military observers in New Delhi
and Islamabad, the Defense Ministry said. The official described
the alleged attack as an attempt to divert world attention from the
secessionist movement in Indian-held Kashmir.
   India accuses Pakistan of arming, training and harboring Moslem
militants fighting in Indian Kashmir, which the Pakistanis deny.
Pakistan contends India is using brutal force to crush an
indigenious independence movement.
   The uprising has cost more than 950 lives since Indian forces
cracked down in late January.
   Tensions increased last spring in the 43-year-old dispute over
Kashmir, a former princely state both nations claim, and their
armies face each other acros the cease-fire line.

<HEAD>Bush Slates Meetings on Gulf, Budget Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush will meet with his
senior economic advisers Tuesday to review the costs of the Persian
Gulf conflict and prepare for next month's negotiations with the
Democrats on the budget deficit, the White House said Monday.
   The gulf crisis has already pushed up oil prices, creating a
further drag on a sluggish U.S. economy veering closer to a
recession.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has said the conflict could
bring the economy's already-anemic growth rate ``closer to zero,''
although he says a recession is not inevitable.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the White
House remains ``hopeful that the Democrats are operating in good
faith and that we'll be able to reach an agreement.''
   ``We think it's even more important that we reach an agreement
now because there needs to be a unity of purpose in this country,
not only about the conflict in the gulf, but also about our
spending issues and about where the budget is going,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Bush, who had planned to interrupt his vacation anyway to return
to Washington for a Pentagon briefing, first will go to the White
House Tuesday to meet with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady,
budget director Richard Darman, economic adviser Michael Boskin and
others.
   Fitzwater said Bush ``wants some preliminary accounting of the
Persian Gulf'' conflict, and whether it may require changes in the
administration's proposal for reducing next year's deficit by $50
billion.
   ``The plan that we had ready to put on the table still
represents our best view, but we're prepared to make changes if we
think it's necessary,'' said the spokesman.
   Bush and his senior advisers will ``be talking about cutting
expenditures, overall budget figures, taxation policy _ all those
kinds of questions,'' Fitzwater said.
   The budget negotiations begun three months ago came to a
temporary halt in early August, having produced little except an
agreement to come back to the table when Congress and Bush return
from their summer vacations after Labor Day.
   Fitzwater said that Bush has no plans to meet with the budget
negotiators again until then. But Bush ``probably will speak out''
in the interim about the budget, he said.
   The president said last week he no longer felt constrained to
hold his peace about the Democrats.
   Brady, in interviews last Friday, said the surge in oil prices
could halve the U.S. growth rate this year from 1.5 percent to 0.75
percent. He said events make it ``all the more important to move
apace'' on budget cuts.
   The administration estimates a fiscal 1991 deficit of $169
billion, not counting an estimated $62 billion more in savings and
loan bailout costs. The negotiators have been trying to cut the
deficit by $50 billion next year and $500 billion over five years.
   Bush acknowledged in late June that ``tax revenue increases''
were necessary, and word subsequently leaked that the Republicans
favored raising taxes on alcohol and limiting deductions for state
and local taxes.
   The Democrats refused to come forward with a plan of their own.
   Bush plans to return to Maine Wednesday after a briefing and a
speech at the Pentagon.

<HEAD>FAA Administrator Freezes Hiring, Anticipating Budget Impasse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Aviation Administrator James Busey
announced Monday a freeze on some hiring and said contingency plans
are being made for sharp cuts if Congress fails to pass a fiscal
1991 budget.
   Following White House instructions for all departments to plan
for cuts, Busey told 50,600 FAA employees they might face mandatory
furloughs without pay for 2{ days each two-week pay period and that
national air traffic would have to be reduced.
   Busey was speaking of a worst-case scenario in the event that
automatic spending cuts of 31.9 percent, known as
``sequestration,'' take effect Oct. 15. That would occur only if
Congress and the White House fail to agree on a package of tax
increases and spending cuts by Oct. 15.
   The immediate hiring freeze applies only to non-safety-related
jobs, Busey told employees in a speech broadcast by closed circuit
to 30 FAA facilities around the country.
   Busey said automatic cuts affecting FAA would total about $2.5
billion a year if they went into effect.
   He said this would lead to reductions in equipment purchases,
suspension of permanent transfers, suspension of training programs,
curtailment of some contracts, release of all temporary employees
and support only for safety activities.
   The FAA would no longer be able to maintain safety in the skies
at current levels, and flights by airlines, businesses and others
would have to be reduced, Busey said.

<HEAD>Farm Labor Force Down From Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of workers employed by farmers
showed a seasonal increase in July but was down about 8 percent
from a year ago, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   A quarterly report said the hired work force on farms was
estimated at 1,106,000 workers during the week of July 8-14, up
from 833,000 in April. But that was down from 1,197,000 in the work
force in July 1989.
   Those did not include 356,000 ``agricultural service'' workers
provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors. In April, those
totaled 203,000 workers, and in July 1989 they were estimated at
351,000.
   Showers and thunderstorms were widespread during the July 8-14
survey week over much of the eastern half of the nation, the report
said. Heavy rains and flooding were common in some areas.
   Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was $5.30
per hour, up from $5.23 per hour a year earlier but below the
average of $5.54 in April, the report said.
   For workers hired by contractors, there was no national wage
rate available. However, workers in California were reported at
$5.82 per hour, compared with $6.59 in April and $5.80 a year
earlier in July 1989. Florida workers averaged $6.11 per hour,
compared with $5.93 in April and $5.55 a year earlier.

   When Marines started preparing
to leave for the Middle East, Shirley Cowart's phone began ringing
at 5:30 a.m.
   Cowart performs marriages at a wedding chapel two miles from the
main gate of the Twentynine Palms Marine Base, 130 miles east of
Los Angeles.
   ``I've been doing weddings at 1 o'clock in the morning at home
in my yard'' said Cowart. ``It's very, very emotional. I think
their happiness is just a cover-up. They are all just very scared.''
   Deborah and Cpl. Marc Castaneda got married Wednesday, even
though they had planned a big church wedding for September.
Castaneda, 23, left for the Middle East on Sunday.
   ``I've been crying since Tuesday, the minute I found out that
guys from Twentynine Palms might be going and that my husband might
be going with them,'' said Mrs. Castaneda, 30. ``I spent my
honeymoon preparing my husband's will and power of attorney.''
   Melinda Davis, 31, and Cpl. Lee Swain, 21, exchanged vows at the
desert chapel Sunday. He knew he was heading to the Middle East,
but was unsure when.
   ``I'm a little fearful ... but I don't think I'm gonna die. I'm
more fearful for my friends,'' Swain said.
   The base normally has a military population of about 10,300,
with 9,100 dependents.

<BYLINE>AIDS Programs for Women Must Address Other Concerns, Researchers
Say
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Programs to help women avoid AIDS also must
address other problems the women see as more immediate, researchers
said Monday.
   ``Talking about condoms with someone who doesn't have a place to
spend the night is absurd,'' said Gloria Weissman of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse in Rockville, Md.
   She and other researchers who are studying prevention of AIDS in
women discussed the topic at the annual meeting of the American
Psychological Association.
   AIDS infection ``is hardly a primary concern for a woman who is
hungry, without a place to spend the night or to put her children
to bed, or without clothing to keep her warm,'' Weissman said.
   ``Unless some of these basic and immediate needs can be
addressed, it seems not only hopeless but also foolish to be
talking about risk reduction and life-saving measures,'' she said.
   The virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome can
infect a person who injects drugs with a contaminated needle or has
sex with an infected person. Several programs around the country
are trying to block those routes of infection for women.
   One problem is that there is no device entirely under a woman's
control that lets her protect herself from infection during
intercourse, said Judith Cohen of the University of California, San
Francisco.
   For many women at risk of infection, it can be dangerous to
insist that her male sex partner use a condom or to refuse to have
sex, she said.
   ``They come back the next day as a medical emergency. You just
don't do that in some households,'' she said.
   Leaving a sexual relationship that poses a threat of infection
can mean giving up rent money and a food supply, she said. In
comparison to those immediate threats, concern about AIDS is ``kind
of down the road,'' she said.
   Prevention programs must address issues of strategies to
persuade men to put on condoms, she said.
   As for drug treatment programs, Weissman said most require that
a woman find somebody else to care for her children during
treatment, which few women can afford.
   And if a woman gets her drug-using male sex partner into
treatment, she must then forgo his economic and emotional support,
Weissman said.

   Actress Esther Rolle, the strong-willed
matriarch in the 1970s hit television series ``Good Times,'' was in
serious but stable condition following a single-car accident that
killed a Texas woman, authorities said.
   Miss Rolle, 69, was in the intensive care unit at University

bruised heart, said hospital spokesman Dale Pugh.
   She was a passenger in a northbound car that rolled over on
Interstate 15 near the California border, Nevada Highway Patrol
troopers said.
   The driver was identified by the Clark County coroner's office
as Paulene Hopkins, 70, of Marshall, Texas. She was pronounced dead
at the scene. Two other passengers suffered minor injuries.
   Miss Rolle recently appeared as the housekeeper Idella in the

<TEXT>
   President Bush and his top aides refuse to
define an ``interdiction of shipping,'' but the unspoken message to
skippers is their ships could be boarded, shot at, or disabled if
they trade with Iraq, military experts said on Monday.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said no formal instructions had
been sent to U.S. warship commanders as of Monday afternoon but
shipping was being monitored in the tense waterways near Iraq.
   ``We are keeping an eye on all ships in the region,'' Williams
said.
   He declined to specify exactly what U.S. commanders would be
told to do, but that the goal of the effort was to comply with the
U.N. mandated sanctions against trade with Iraq.
   Williams said the Pentagon was working on ``precise plans'' for
the ``operations, logistical, legal'' aspects of the interdiction
effort.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, with Bush in
Kennebunkport, Maine, said on Monday: ``We have had two or three
ships in recent hours that have turned away or been turned away, or
at least have otherwise not landed with their cargo.''
   Purposely, Bush and other administration officials avoid using
the word blockade _ since that is widely considered by
international law to be an act of war.
   A former commander of the U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, Gen.
George Crist, said any interdiction mission will be easily
accomplished by the U.S. Navy forces in the region.
   Dozens of American vessels have been posted in the
Mediterranean, Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and at the mouth of that
strategic waterway _ all able to monitor the comings and goings of
shipping to and from Iraq, he noted.
   Using international radio frequencies, U.S. commanders will
query them about their destinations and cargoes, Crist told CBS
News.
   ``If it is going to Iraq, then we'll ask them to steer clear. If
they keep going, we may board to see what their papers look like,
where are they going, what kind of cargoes they have,'' Crist said.
   If the captain of the ship decides he wants to continue in spite
of the questioning, the U.S. commander will move his ship in such a
way as to prevent the further passage of the cargo ship ``and
advise him nicely would he mind going to another port,'' Crist said.
   If that doesn't work, ``we'll probably fire a shot or two just
to get his attention. If necessary, we'll actually land people on
the ship and move him. We also can disable the ship, shoot off the
rudder, and he can't go any place,'' the general said.
   A U.S. military commander familiar with the day-to-day
instructions given to officers confirmed Crist's account of how a
commander might handle such a situation if so directed.
   And while U.S. warships have no standing orders, ``it's
generally up to the commander to decide what to do,'' he said.
   The officer knows to ``accomplish his mission with the lowest
level of force possible _ interdiction means that you physically
interrupt the progress of a ship or vessel. You put your ship in
such a position that you cause another ship to alter its
behavior,'' the official said.
   Ideally, a public warning of the possible use of force might
cause most shippers to halt activities of their own accord _ or
even cause insurers to withdraw coverage, the official said,
resulting in a halt of shipping without a shot ever being fired.
   The military official said the monitoring Williams' spoke of
referred to the vast array of intelligence gathering methods
available to U.S. forces around the world.
   ``It's the cargos, not the ships, that are important,'' he said.
``We have ways of knowing what's on those ships, if it's relevant.''
   A delicate international legal situation arises, because a halt
in shipping to and from Iraq will most probably mean dealing with
ships from third-party nations, the official pointed out.
   Another question to be answered is the treatment of ships in
other ports around the world with cargo bound for Iraq, another
official said.
   ``And a third worry is freedom of navigation, if anyone tries to
interfere with the movement of any ships in the region's
choke-points,'' the official said. ``Our intent to maintain freedom
of navigation in the region.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III caught officials by
surprise on Sunday when he said U.S. officials intended to slap an
immediate trade embargo around Iraq and that its oil tankers would
be stopped at sea.
   The statement sent the Pentagon's strategists and legal experts
scurrying to define for its military commanders just what steps can
be taken to put a choke hold on Iraq's lifeline of oil, commerce
and foodstuffs.
   White House spokesman said the purpose of the sanctions and the
embargo ``is to put the pinch'' on the Iraqis, and that means ``not
let supplies go in that allow them to maintain the war machine,
allow them to maintain their aggressive takeover of Kuwait.''

<HEAD>Umbilical Blood Transfusion Given To Cure Leukemia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE FITZHENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 4-year-old boy got a transfusion of umbilical
cord blood from his newborn sister Monday in an attempt to cure a
rare and deadly form of leukemia.
   It was the first time such a transfusion had been attempted. In
the past, bone marrow transplant has been the only treatment to
increase survival for patients of leukeumia, a cancer of the white
blood cells.
   If the transfusion works, doctors said, it could lead to the
creation of a bank of such blood that could be transfused into
children who might die before a sibling donor would be old enough
to donate bone marrow.
   The patient, Michael Sancilio, of Virginia Beach, Va., was
diagnosed in April as suffering from juvenile chronic myelogenous
leukemia. It cannot be controlled by drugs and usually kills within
one year of diagnosis.
   When Michael's sister, Christina, was born May 1, doctors
collected blood from the cord, hoping she would be a suitable donor.
   They couldn't wait to use her bone marrow because such a
transplant can't be performed on children under six-months old, and
doctors feared Michael could die by then.
   ``The odds were we thought he had the chance of surviving for a
couple of months but it was unknown when the disease would
accelerate and become life-threatening,'' said Dr. John Wagner of
the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center. ``We decided to go ahead and
take the chance on the cord-blood rather than waiting till the
donor was old enough.''
   Michael's parents and his brother, Tony, 7, weren't compatible
donors.
   Wagner injected three syringes of cord blood into a vessel near
Michael's heart as the boy dozed in his bed Monday, Wagner said.
   The boy had undergone eight days of chemotherapy to destroy his
cancerous marrow. The transfused cells from Christina are expected
to enter his bones and begin forming cancer-free bone marrow in 30
days, Wagner said.
   Cord blood transplants have been performed successfully twice in
France and once in Cincinnati to treat a different disease,
Fanconi's anemia, Hopkins doctors said.
   Blood in the umbilical cord provides nourishment and oxygen to a
fetus while being carried inside the mother, and so differs from
the baby's or the mother's blood.
   Dr. Richard Champlin, chief of the bone marrow transplant
program at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said the
transplant could have long-term significance.
   ``In the long run it could provide the potential to protect and
store umbilical blood from every baby and create a bank of cells
for transplantation that could be used if a patient didn't have a
donor within the family,'' he said.
   ``We hope it may be able to increase the number of donors
available for patients, but it has to pass this test first,''
Wagner said.
   The transplant carries the same risk as a bone-marrow
transplant. The recipient's immunity from infection is lowered
during the procedure, and the body often rejects foreign cells.
   Umbilical cord-blood is particularly rich in stem cells, which
the transplant recipient's body uses to form marrow. But the blood
could only be transplanted to young children, because it doesn't
contain enough stem cells to build marrow in the bodies of
adolescents or adults, Champlin said.
   The transplant also raises ethical questions, said Dr. Jeff
Malatack, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh.
   In suburban Los Angeles, parents conceived a baby last year to
serve as a donor for their cancer-stricken daughter. Anissa Ayala,
18, was expected to receive a bone-marrow transplant from her baby
sister, Marissa, in late summer or in the fall.
   ``Is the parent in the right position to offer the procedure be
done on a 6-month-old to save a 4-year-old? The question will come
up within families. What if it comes up with an unrelated baby?''
said Malatack.
   Malatack posited, for example, that if parents found umbilical
cord blood in a bank from a baby they thought had similar tissue to
their sick child, they might try to approach that child's parents
about a possible bone marrow transplant.
   ``Someone could say, `I'd like to use your baby to put to sleep
and do a bone marrow harvest so a baby in some other area of the
country could benefit,''' he said.

<HEAD>Ohio Woman May Get Dodge Pickup for Rejecting Car</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Ohio woman who turned down a $17,000 Honda
she won on a game show because it was non-union will receive a new
car _ union made, of course _ from the AFL-CIO, the labor
federation said Monday.
   Last week, Pamela Richards told game show officials ``I don't
want that Honda. I am union,'' when she won an Accord on the Ohio
lottery show ``Cash Explosion Double Play.'' She took a $1,000 cash
prize instead.
   The AFL-CIO was moved by her comments, especially since the game
show bleeped over them, said Rex Hardesty, a spokesman for the 14.2
million member federation. The union decided to give Richards a car.
   ``What we're trying to do is show that that's the point of view
of a lot of people in this country, and they can't get their
message out,'' Hardesty said.
   The Honda that Richards rejected was made at a plant in
Marysville, Ohio., where labor leaders contend the Japanese
automaker has used union-busting stunts to keep the United Auto
Workers from organizing workers.
   Richards, a 23-year UAW member who lives in Risingsun, Ohio,
wants a Dodge Dakota pickup, Hardesty said. Top-of-the-line Dakota
trucks sell for between $16,000 and $20,000.
   Earlier Monday, a car dealer in Huntington, W.Va., offered to
loan Richards a 1990 Imperial, a $28,000 luxury sedan, for a year.
   ``The stand she took to buy American was really remarkable,''
said Frank Horney, president of Huntington Chrysler Imperial.
   Richards said her four-driver family has four cars, but several
of the vehicles are in poor condition.
   ``I'm excited. I never knew it was going to go this far,'' she
said after being told of Horney's offer.

<HEAD>Iran Rejects Saddam's Peace Proposal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iranian leaders on Monday rejected Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's proposal linking a settlement of the
Persian Gulf crisis in part with resolution of a border dispute
with Iran, Tehran television reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Foreign Ministry
spokesman Morteza Sarmadi as saying ``linking the withdrawal of
Iraqi troops from Iran to other international issues corresponds
neither to international norms nor to Iraq's alleged commitment to
United Nations Resolution 598.''
   The U.N. resolution halted the bloody eight-year war between
Iran and Iraq in August 1988. But subsequent peace talks have been
deadlocked, and no formal peace treaty has been signed.
   In a statement Sunday, Saddam suggested that all problems of
occupation in the Middle East be resolved together.
   Saddam indicated he might withdraw his forces from Kuwait if
Israel withdrew from occupied Arab territories and Syria pulled its
soldiers out of Lebanon.
   He also called for a settlement of the border dispute with Iran,
including a mutual withdrawal of forces on both sides of the
boundary.
   The Iraqis insist that a 1975 treaty drawing part of the mutual
border at midstream in the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway is null and void.
Baghdad claims sovereignty over the full strategic waterway that
links the port of Basra with the gulf.
   Sarmadi said Iran complied with U.N. Resolution 598 by
withdrawing its forces to internationally recognized borders.
   But he said ``parts of Iranian territory, since then, have
remained under Iraqi occupation in defiance of the resolutin and
all international regulations.''
   He was referring to Iranian territory captured in the closing
weeks of the war that Baghdad has refused to relinquish until
Tehran agrees to grant full Iraqi sovereignty over the Shatt.

<TEXT>
   A visiting U.S. congressman said Monday
chances were slim of forcing Iraq to quit Kuwait without Jordanian
sanctions. The Iraqi oil pipeline and road transport between Jordan
and Iraq were reported operating normally.
   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., said immediately after
conferring with Crown Prince Hassan, brother of King Hussein: ``We
have two overriding interests at present and the first is to secure
the effective cooperation of Jordan in the implementation of
sanctions against Iraq.
   ``The second is to preserve the stability of this country.''
   He spoke to The Associated Press on the Basman royal palace
grounds.
   Iraq's pipeline to Jordan terminates at desert outpost H-4,
about 30 miles southeast of Amman. Tanker trucks load the petroleum
there and drive it to the Red Sea port of Aqaba for export. Some
oil is kept for Jordanian domestic use.
   The line is apparently Iraq's last remaining oil export outlet
following the closure, in effect, earlier Monday of a pipeline
across Saudi Arabia.
   Information Minister Ibrahim Izzeddine reiterated Monday that
Jordan intends to abide by the mandatory U.N. Security resolution
imposing sanctions on neighboring Iraq for its Aug. 2 invasion and
annexation of Kuwait.
   ``But it is still premature now to decide what sanctions will be
imposed,'' Izzeddine said, in view of Jordan's heavy economic
dependence on Iraq.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli officials warned Jordan Monday not to
transfer Iraqi exports through Aqaba, saying that would violate
blockading of Iraq. Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, deputy chief of the
Israeli Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee,
described Aqaba as Iraq's ``lifeline.''
   Official sources at Jordan's Ministry of Commerce, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the pipeline was continuing to operate
normally Monday.
   Solarz said he and Hassan discussed the Persian Gulf crisis
``and the implication for Jordan-American relations as well as the
peace process between Israel and the Arab world.''
   ``I think it is important that sanctions take effect forthwith .
.. because they are the last and only remaining way to bring about
a resolution of the crisis without the use of force,'' Solarz said.
   ``If sanctions don't work we will be confronted with the
necessity of making a choice between capitulation and escalation
and that is a choice very much in our interest to avoid.''
   He said that ``if Jordan refuses to cooperate in the sanctions .
.. there will be little hope of forcing Saddam Hussein to withdraw
his forces from Kuwait.'' Saddam is president of Iraq.
   Hassan said later on Jordanian television that ``we are under
pressure from all sides from those who want to tell us how to
conduct our affairs.''
   ``Jordan will be enormously hurt when it applies sanctions
against Iraq,'' he added, speaking in English in an interview with
a visiting Australian TV correspondent.
   An Iraqi tanker was turned away when it tried to load at the
Saudi pipeline's Red Sea terminal. An Iraqi pipeline through Turkey
was shut earlier.
   The Commerce Ministry sources said Jordan imports nearly $300
million worth of Iraqi oil a year _ one-sixth of it by pipeline and
the rest overland by tankers.
   They said the pipeline was used for much larger quantities
during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war when Iraq's gulf ports were
blockaded, but were unable to give its total capacity.
   AP photographer Yousef Allan at Jordan's border post of
Ruweishid, 210 miles northeast of Amman, reported commercial
traffic normal across the border. He said a truck or tanker crossed
into Jordan every three or four minutes.
   Official statistics indicate that 40 percent of Jordan's exports
go to Iraq, mainly agricultural products.
   Ministry officials said unemployment here, now at 16 percent,
would go up 10 to 12 more percentage points if Jordan imposes
sanctions.
   Jordan is also used extensively as a transit point for
Iraqi-bound goods.
   Aqaba port officials reached by telephone said they received no
instructions to stop unloading ships with Iraq-bound transit cargo,
and unloading of these ships was continuing normally.

   President Bush and his top aides refuse to
define an ``interdiction of shipping,'' but the unspoken message to
skippers is their ships could be boarded, shot at, or disabled if
they trade with Iraq, military experts said on Monday.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said no formal instructions had
been sent to U.S. warship commanders as of Monday afternoon but
shipping was being monitored in the tense waterways near Iraq.
   ``We are keeping an eye on all ships in the region,'' Williams
said.
   He declined to specify exactly what U.S. commanders would be
told to do, but that the goal of the effort was to comply with the
U.N. mandated sanctions against trade with Iraq.
   Williams said the Pentagon was working on ``precise plans'' for
the ``operations, logistical, legal'' aspects of the interdiction
effort.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, with Bush in
Kennebunkport, Maine, said on Monday: ``We have had two or three
ships in recent hours that have turned away or been turned away, or
at least have otherwise not landed with their cargo.''
   Purposely, Bush and other administration officials avoid using
the word blockade _ since that is widely considered by
international law to be an act of war.
   A former commander of the U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, Gen.
George Crist, said any interdiction mission will be easily
accomplished by the U.S. Navy forces in the region.
   Dozens of American vessels have been posted in the
Mediterranean, Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and at the mouth of that
strategic waterway _ all able to monitor the comings and goings of
shipping to and from Iraq, he noted.
   Using international radio frequencies, U.S. commanders will
query them about their destinations and cargoes, Crist told CBS
News.
   ``If it is going to Iraq, then we'll ask them to steer clear. If
they keep going, we may board to see what their papers look like,
where are they going, what kind of cargoes they have,'' Crist said.
   If the captain of the ship decides he wants to continue in spite
of the questioning, the U.S. commander will move his ship in such a
way as to prevent the further passage of the cargo ship ``and
advise him nicely would he mind going to another port,'' Crist said.
   If that doesn't work, ``we'll probably fire a shot or two just
to get his attention. If necessary, we'll actually land people on
the ship and move him. We also can disable the ship, shoot off the
rudder, and he can't go any place,'' the general said.
   A U.S. military commander familiar with the day-to-day
instructions given to officers confirmed Crist's account of how a
commander might handle such a situation if so directed.
   And while U.S. warships have no standing orders, ``it's
generally up to the commander to decide what to do,'' he said.
   The officer knows to ``accomplish his mission with the lowest
level of force possible _ interdiction means that you physically
interrupt the progress of a ship or vessel. You put your ship in
such a position that you cause another ship to alter its
behavior,'' the official said.
   Ideally, a public warning of the possible use of force might
cause most shippers to halt activities of their own accord _ or
even cause insurers to withdraw coverage, the official said,
resulting in a halt of shipping without a shot ever being fired.
   The military official said the monitoring Williams' spoke of
referred to the vast array of intelligence gathering methods
available to U.S. forces around the world.
   ``It's the cargos, not the ships, that are important,'' he said.
``We have ways of knowing what's on those ships, if it's relevant.''
   A delicate international legal situation arises, because a halt
in shipping to and from Iraq will most probably mean dealing with
ships from third-party nations, the official pointed out.
   Another question to be answered is the treatment of ships in
other ports around the world with cargo bound for Iraq, another
official said.
   ``And a third worry is freedom of navigation, if anyone tries to
interfere with the movement of any ships in the region's
choke-points,'' the official said. ``Our intent to maintain freedom
of navigation in the region.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III caught officials by
surprise on Sunday when he said U.S. officials intended to slap an
immediate trade embargo around Iraq and that its oil tankers would
be stopped at sea.
   The statement sent the Pentagon's strategists and legal experts
scurrying to define for its military commanders just what steps can
be taken to put a choke hold on Iraq's lifeline of oil, commerce
and foodstuffs.
   White House spokesman said the purpose of the sanctions and the
embargo ``is to put the pinch'' on the Iraqis, and that means ``not
let supplies go in that allow them to maintain the war machine,
allow them to maintain their aggressive takeover of Kuwait.''

   Kidnappers in south Lebanon freed a Swiss
hostage after 10 months of captivity, releasing Elio Erriquez to
Syrian officials there who took him to Damascus and handed him over
to the Swiss ambassador early Tuesday.
   ``I am happy, very, very happy,'' Red Cross worker Erriquez, 24,
said at the Foreign Ministry before being whisked away by Swiss
Ambassador Eric Pfister minutes after his arrival in the Syrian
capital.
   Another Swiss hostage, Emanuel Christen, 33, was freed on
Wednesday. Like Erriquez, Christen was an orthopedic technician
with the International Committee of the Red Cross. Both men were
kidnapped on Oct. 6, in Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.
   In Beirut, a late-night communique from a group calling itself
the Organization of the Palestinian Revolutionary Squads said
Erriquez was handed over on Monday to a representative of Brig.
Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, chief of Syria's military intelligence in
Lebanon. The group said earlier that Erriquez was freed at the
behest of Syria, Libya and Algeria.
   Syria's state minister for foreign affairs, Nasser Qaddour,
turned the hostage over at 12:03 a.m. Tuesday after he was driven
from Lebanon.
   Erriquez, wearing a white shirt and white pants, looked pale but
well as his ordeal ended. He was driven to Pfister's residence in
Damascus. There was no word on when he would leave Syria.
   In Geneva, his mother Graziana Erriquez, had agaonzied for hours
Monday before receiving official confirmation her son was free.
   ``Waiting for definite word was bad,'' she told a reporter. ``I
had been waiting all day long. But now, I am very happy.''
   A brief, handwritten statement in Arabic from the kidnappers was
delivered to a Western news agency at 11 p.m. Monday, with an
authenticating photograph of the hostage.
   It said: ``The Organization of the Palestinian Revolutionary
Squads announces that the release of the second Swiss hostage Elio
Erriquez has been accomplished. He was handed over to a
representative of Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan.''
   The statement said the two Swiss were freed in response to
efforts by Presidents Hafez Assad of Syria and Chadli Bendjedid of
Algeria and by Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi. It gave no
details.
   Masked gunmen seized Erriquez and Christen last October near a
Red Cross center for artificial limbs in Sidon.
   Lebanese police had blamed the abduction on Fatah-Revolutionary
Council, a radical guerrilla group led by Palestinian terrorist
mastermind Abu Nidal. The group denied the accusation.
   The Palestinian Revolutionary Squads said Monday it has no
connection with Abu Nidal or any other Palestinian faction.
   Erriquez' release left 14 Western hostages in Lebanon, most of
them held by underground Shiite Moslem extremists loyal to Iran.
   The captives are six Americans, four Britons, two West Germans,
an Irishman and an Italian.
   Most have been held three years or more. The longest held is
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, who was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   The kidnappers' statement on Monday paid ``particular tribute to
Mustafa Saad for efficient role to ensure a success'' of the
release. Saad heads the leftist Nasserite Popular Organization
militia, which has controlled Sidon since the outbreak of the
Lebanese civil war in 1975.
   The Swiss Foreign Ministry and the Red Cross have denied any
deal was made to win Christen's release.
   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said last week the release
may have been a result of France's decision last month to pardon
Anis Naccache and four other members of a pro-Iranian assassination
team.

Fires</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RED BLUFF, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One raging forest fire threatened about
1,600 homes Monday in northern California and three major blazes
remained out of control in Yosemite National Park.
   Fourteen major fires and several smaller ones burned across
California on Monday. The biggest fire _ the Campbell complex in
Tehama County _ had charred about 114,000 acres, officials said.
   But firefighters' top priority was a smaller Tehama County fire,
the 17,500-acre Finley Lake fire east of Red Bluff, which
threatened 400 homes in the town of Manton, 200 in Mineral and an
additional 1,000 in the general area, officials said.
   Loren Newman, a 73-year-old Manton resident, said he hadn't
planned to leave his home. But as firefighters cut a 30-foot wide
firebreak across his property Monday, he was reconsidering.
   ``I usually don't get too excited about fires, but this one has
me hemmed in,'' he said. ``There's fire to the west, to the south
and to the east.''
   Elsewhere in the West, smaller fires burned in Oregon, Alaska,
Washington, Idaho and Utah.
   About 1,200 soldiers from the Army's 9th Infantry Division at
Fort Lewis near Tacoma, Wash., shipped out Monday to help fight
fires in Oregon, Maj. John Lundberg said. They were to help dig
fire lines and relieve fatigued crews battling two big blazes near
Burns, Ore.
   It is the third summer in a row Fort Lewis troops have been used
to battle fires. They were fought fires in Yellowstone National
Park in 1988 and the Baker, Ore., area last summer, Lundberg said.
   An estimated 1,200 Army soldiers from the 4th Infantry Division
at Fort Carson, Colo., were expected to arrive in Tuesday in
northern California, where a long drought has heightened fire
danger.
   Firefighting in northern California was hampered by an inversion
layer _ a layer of cool air holding hot air down _ that held in
smoke, creating hot and hazy conditions. Airplanes that bomb the
fires with a mixture of fire retardant and fertilizer to encourage
new growth were unable to fly Sunday or Monday, officials said.
   Because of the thick smoke, fire officials had to bring in
helicopters with infrared sensors to identify ``hot spots'' and map
them for ground crews.
   On the Finley Lake fire, firefighters worked Monday to create a
two-mile-long defense line in Manton, burning out a swath that
hopefully would counter the northbound forest fire and keep it from
destroying several homes.
   ``Manton is our main concern this afternoon. There's up to 400
homes and 1,000 people in that area,'' said Paul Bertagna,
California Department of Forestry spokesman.
   The fire also was nearing Lassen National Forest near Mineral
and Lassen Volcanic National Park to the north.
   Manton residents hadn't been evacuated by midday but residents
were advised to be ready to leave officials said.
   Manton resident Sally Beezley decided to leave her home.
   ``I was really calm until last night,'' she said. ``But when you
see the flames, everything changes.
   ``The tops of the trees were on fire, and it was close enough so
you could feel the waves of heat.''
   Farther south in the Sierra Nevada range, three major fires
still raged Monday in Yosemite National Park, where an estimated
17,000 acres had been charred.
   Yosemite has been off-limits to tourists since Friday.
   Flames in the park were within two miles of Merced Grove, a
stand of giant sequoia trees up to 2,000 years old, and also within
two miles of the Badger Pass ski area, the oldest ski resort in
California. The sequoias were treated with fire retardant, but
their thick bark usually protects them from fire, allowing dthem to
reach their advanced ages.
   Flames were about 10 miles from landmarks like El Capitan, Half
Dome and Yosemite Falls.
   Since Aug. 3, more than 200,000 acres of California forest has
burned, mostly as the result of 31,108 lightning strikes, forestry
officials said. A total of 127 structures had been lost as of
Monday, including 42 from the Finley fire, Collier said.

<TEXT>
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz urged
the Arab League to reconsider its decision to transfer its
headquarters to Cairo, Egypt, the official Iraqi News Agency said
Monday.
   Also, Iraqi news reports monitored Monday in Nicosia said Iraq
has started special ``Voice of Arab Egypt'' broadcasts calling for
an uprising against the government of President Hosni Mubarak and
attacks on ``imperialist'' targets.
   The broadcasts started Saturday on frequencies of Iraq radio's
domestic service.
   A program with the same name was introduced by Iraq radio after
the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's visit to Jerusalem in
1977, which led to the Camp David peace agreement with Israel. The
program was later discontinued.
   Iraq and Egypt have been at odds over Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. Egypt has sent several
thousand soldiers to Saudi Arabia as part of a pan-Arab force to
deter Iraqi aggression.
   In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, Aziz said the
Arab League's decision to move its headquarters from the Tunisian
capital of Tunis to Cairo must be reconsidered due to Mubarak's
``biased running'' of last week's emergency summit to discuss the
Iraqi invasion.
   Twelve of the 21 League members voted at the summit to send an
Arab force to the gulf region to protect Saudi Arabia and other
threatened states from a possible attack by Iraq. Most League
members also supported U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
   The manner in which Mubarak ran the meeting was a ``violation of
the prevailing methods and norms in inter-Arab relations,'' Aziz
said in the news agency report, which was monitored in Nicosia.
   Aziz, who attended the summit, accused Egyptian leaders of
violating the Arab League charter, particularly an article which
requires unanimity for adopting measures against a member state.
   He said the Iraqi delegation would raise the issue at the next
meeting of the Arab League's Council scheduled for September in
Tunis and demand that the headquarters remain in Tunisia.
   The League headquarters moved from Cairo to Tunis in 1979 after
Egypt's membership was suspended for signing the peace treaty with
Israel. Last year, the suspension was lifted and the headquarters
is to move back to its former building on the Nile River this fall.
   Also Monday, Saddam asked Iraqis to treat Egyptians in his
country with kindness, regardless of differences between their
countries over the Gulf crisis.
   There are about 2 million Egyptians in Iraq, mostly workers who
immigrated during the Iran-Iraq war.
   ``We call on all Iraqis, due to the present situation, to treat
all Arab citizens well regardless of their rulers' stand,'' Saddam
said in a letter addressed to the Iraqi people. Contents of the
letter were reported by the Iraqi News Agency.
   ``All Arab citizens are your brothers. It is normal to say that
not all Arab rulers were of our choice. Part of them were chosen by
foreigners,'' Saddam said.
   ``We call on you specially to treat Egyptian citizens with the
level of my affection and with the level of their kindness and
their love to Iraq,'' he said.

   Locally heavy rain was triggered Monday by a cold front
extending from the southern Plains through the Ohio Valley to the
eastern Great Lakes.
   During the day Monday, 1.70 inches of rain fell during the six
hours up to 2 p.m. EDT at Jacksonville, Ark.; 1.43 inches fell at
Fort Sill, Okla.; 1.24 inches at Cincinnati; 1.18 inches at

<HEAD>Officials: No Contradiction Between U.N. Embargo, U.S. Quarantine</HEAD>

   U.S. and U.N. officials said Monday there
was no contradiction between the United Nations' resolution that
imposed a trade embargo against Iraq and President Bush's statement
that food be included in American quarantine efforts.
   Iraq, roundly condemned internationally for its Aug. 2 invasion
of neighboring Kuwait, imports three-quarters of its food for its
17 million residents.
   Both the U.N. embargo against Iraq and the U.S. quarantine
include all foodstuffs and grain shipments, except in cases of
distress and humanitarian aid, U.N. and U.S. officials said Monday,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The officials emphasized there was no contradiction between the
U.N. resolution, adopted Aug. 6, and Bush's statement Sunday that
food would be included in quarantine efforts.
   The U.N. resolution only exempts food from the embargo ``in
humanitarian circumstances.'' It bars the import of food to build
up Iraqi stocks and allows it only when there is serious need.
   Bush said that food would be covered in U.S. efforts to
interdict commercial vessels bound for Iraq, but added that in some
cases of severe deprivation and need there might be exemptions.
   The language in the convoluted U.N. resolution has given rise to
confusion about inclusion or exclusion of food, and U.N. officials
declined to interpret the language, saying the resolution stands
for itself.
   But privately they said the resolution imposes an embargo on all
foodstuffs, except in dire circumstances. Canada reportedly ordered
a grain vessel bound for Iraq to return recently, diplomats said.
   Section C of the U.N. resolution says that U.N. member states
should prevent:
   ``The sale or supply by their nationals or from their
territories or using their flag vessels of any commodities or
products, including weapons or any other military equipment,
whether or note originating in their territories but not including
supplies intended strictly for medical purposes and, in
humanitarian circumstances, foodstuffs, to any person or body in
Iraq or Kuwait or to any person or body for the purposes of any
business carried on in or operated from Iraq or Kuwait, and any
activities by their nationals or in their territories which promote
or are calculated to promte such saleor supply of such commodities
or products.''
   The resolution also bans financial dealings with Iraq except
those intended exclusively for medical or humanitarian purposes and
``in humanitarian circumstances, foodstuffs.''

   A small Tennessee company is fighting
the Pentagon's plan to reduce the size of its $20 million contract
for chemical protective suits that soldiers might need in the
Middle East.
   Only weeks before U.S. troops headed to Saudi Arabia to counter
Iraq and its threat of chemical warfare, the Army notified Camel
Manufacturing Co. its contract would be reduced from 327,000
protective suits to 81,000.
   The Army claimed that Camel _ one of four companies that makes
the suits for the military _ was slow to start making the suits.
Company officials blame the government for the delays.
   Rep. James H. Quillen, the senior state Republican in Congress,
wrote Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Monday seeking review of the
Camel case.
   The letter ``stressed how important it is, especially during the
Mideast crisis, that the contract be turned around,'' Quillen said.
``Let them finish the number of suits that they have been awarded.''
   Company officials are worried they won't have enough capital to
keep the 250-employee Newport, Tenn., factory open past September.
Camel already has spent most of the $3.5 million advanced on the
$20 million order.
   But company president Ben Bower said Monday that both Turkey and
the United Arab Emirates were negotiating to buy suits from the
company.
   The suits resemble camouflage fatigues, but are lined with
charcoal-impregnated foam that acts as a filter to absorb poisons.
Life inside the suits is roughly 10 degrees hotter than outside,
but that's a small price to pay for survival, Bower said.
   ``They are not designed to be worn under normal circumstances,''
he said. ``They are totally impractical for any other use.''
   Camel, which has been producing tents, field packs and similar
goods for the military for 60 years, is one of only a few companies
supplying the Army with chemical protection suits.
   The others are Sac &amp; Fox, of Oklahoma City, Okla.; Isratex, of
New York City, and National Apparel Co., of Birmingham, Ala.
   ``This is the first time we made these suits,'' Bower said. ``As
a matter of fact, the government came to us and asked us to
participate in this project.''
   The government had no comment Monday.
   ``Normally, we are very up-front about contractual matters as a
matter of public record,'' said Linda Nichols, spokeswoman for the
Defense Logistics Agency, an arm of the Pentagon. ``But the way
things are right now, we are being very careful about what we say.''
   In cutting the order, the government cited delays in production
at the Newport plant, Bower said.
   Production was scheduled to start in July 1989 but didn't begin
until February. About 7,500 suits have been made so far. In full
operation the plant is supposed to make 50,000 suits a month.
   Camel contends it would have started production sooner except
for delays by the Army's Defense Personnel Support Center in
Philadelphia in inspecting the cloth used in the suits.
   Bower said his company's contract allowed the center 30 days to
inspect the materials. Instead, it took six months, he said.

<HEAD>Cardinal O'Connor to Hear New Anti-Abortion Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 200 Roman Catholic bishops
holding an unusually secretive meeting get their first glimpse
Tuesday of a new anti-abortion campaign put together by a public
relations firm.
   An official of the company hired by the bishops, Hill and
Knowlton, said Monday they shouldn't expect anything startling.
   ``There's nothing new in this business, only new ways of
packaging,'' said Phil Armstong, a Hill and Knowlton senior vice
president.
   The two-day meeting of the National Council of Catholic Bishops
is closed to the press.
   Church officials said they didn't plan to release a text of a
speech that was to be delivered Monday by Cardinal John O'Connor,
the archbishop of New York and chairman of the Bishops' Committee
for Pro-Life Activities.
   Monday's program included conferences, speeches and
anti-abortion films, according to a participant who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The talks included one titled ``Abortion: Big Business.'' The
film titles included ``Living Proof: A Visual Encounter with the
Unborn'' and ``Adoption: The Option of Love.''
   The Hill and Knowlton campaign is designed to ``reframe the
abortion question for both the Catholic community and the general
public,'' said Julie Sly, spokeswoman for the California Catholic
conference.
   Sly defended the meeting's secrecy, especially involving the
Hill and Knowlton presentation.
   ``They regard this as any other corporation that buys public
relations services,'' she said. ``They won't release a working
report to the public. It could undermine their campaign.''
   Armstrong said company's presentation would ``basically involve
research into public attitudes and show them how to better
communicate the pro-life message.''
   The bishops also retained the Wirthlin Group, a leading
Republican polling firm that helped Ronald Reagan win his 1980
presidential campaign. That firm also was expected to deliver a
report Tuesday.
   The hiring of Hill and Knowlton drew criticism from Eugene
Kennedy, a professor of psychology at Loyola University in Chicago.
   ``The bishops have found a way to drive the money changers back
into the temple,'' said Kennedy, who has written extensively on the
Catholic Church in America. ``They are making a terrible mistake.
They are playing in the ballpark of the pro-choice people and
abandoning their real strength, which is spiritual and pastoral.''

   A man who drank a cocaine-laced soft drink from
Colombia was declared brain dead Monday.
   A life support system for Maximo Rene Menendez was to be turned
off Tuesday, according to an order signed by Dade County Judge
Robert Newman.
   Menendez, 25, drank the contaminated bottle of Pony Malta on
July 26 and immediately collapsed. He has been in a coma since the
incident.
   The Food and Drug Administration recalled a shipment of the
drink, and so far FBI laboratory technicians have found 20 bottles
containing up to several ounces of cocaine each. Drug Enforcement
Administration officials have said they believe the bottles were
part of a drug-smuggling scheme gone awry.
   No suspects have been identified in the case, although police
are looking for the owners of Miami Sweet, which imported the
drink. The bottles were not intended for export and carried false
labels, according to the Cerveceria Bavaria S.A., the Colombian
company that manufactures the drink.
   State Attorney Janet Reno said she was consulting with
Metro-Dade police about filing murder charges, but did not expect
any decision before Tuesday.

   About 500 Americans have quietly slipped out
of Kuwait since the Iraqi conquest of that country, circumventing
an Iraqi attempt to prevent Westerners from leaving, the State
Department said Monday.
   The departures have lowered the official estimate of Americans
in the Iraqi-held country to 2,500, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said.
   Other officials said the estimate is subject to change because
precise numbers in such circumstances are hard to come by.
   The officials, insisting on anonymity, said fleeing Americans
have been able to take advantage of lax Iraqi security at the final
check point on Kuwaiti territory and enter the relative safety of
Saudi Arabia.
   But a Briton, David Thomas Croskery, who apparently tried to
flee by the same route was shot to death on Saturday by Iraqi
troops in Kuwait. Ms. Tutwiler said the administration was
``shocked and extremely concerned'' by the incident.
   She said there were rumors on Sunday that all foreigners were
being allowed to leave but the administration has been told that
only Africans, South Asians and Latins are being given such
permission. Iraqi broadcasts indicate that Arabs and East Asians
also have been allowed to depart as well.
   False news reports about the opening of the Kuwait border with
Saudi Arabia to all foreigners prompted 40 to 50 carloads of
Americans to head for the frontier, Ms. Tutwiler said.
   She urged the media to report such developments with caution
because the carloads of Americans were turned back at the border,
their disappointment aggravated by ``blistering heat.''
   The attempted exodus may have been the result of an Iraqi
broadcast on Sunday saying the authorities have been instructed to
``facilitate the travel of the Arabs and foreign residents in
Kuwait and other cities of southern Iraq.'' Southern Iraq is the
term Iraqis have used to describe what was once Kuwait.
   Besides the Americans stranded in Kuwait, there are an
additional 500 to 600 who have not been given permission to leave
Iraq. With airports closed in both countries and borders sealed to
Westerners, the Bush administration has become increasingly
concerned that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein may try to use the
Americans to his political advantage.
   Still, the administration has refused to call the Americans in
the two countries hostages. No demands have been made in return for
their release.
   Foreigners fleeing Kuwait have given mixed reports on the
situation there. Some accused Iraqi troops of rapes and other
abuses but others said the Iraqis were well disciplined.
   On the diplomatic front, Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly
flew to Syria on Sunday for additional consultations after visits
to Egypt and Saudi Arabia over the weekend.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the meeting with the Saudi officials ``was
part of our ongoing cooperative efforts with the Saudi government
to confront the threat from Iraq and to work towards the immediate
and unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait and the
restoration of the legitimate government there.''
   She said there are conversations almost hourly with Iraqi
officials in Baghdad and Washington on the situation concerning the
Americans in Kuwait and Iraq. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
has called Iraq's refusal to allow the Americans to leave a
``violation of norms.''
   Baker had been scheduled to leave for his Wyoming ranch late
last week for a vacation but plans to remain here until Thursday.
   ``A full communications package will be traveling with him, and
should the need arise, he can be back in Washington in
approximately four hours,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.

   U.S. Marines flew helicopters into
rebel-held territory in Liberia on Monday to evacuate 97 foreign
nationals, including at least four Americans, fleeing heavy
fighting in the capital Monrovia.
   The evacuees, who included the Spanish ambassador and the papal
nuncio to Liberia, were airlifted during the morning from the port
of Buchanan, which is controlled by rebel leader Charles Taylor's
National Patriotic Front.
   In addition to the Americans, the evacuees included at least 16
Spaniards, 15 West Germans, as well as smaller numbers of citizens
of India, Lebanon, Switzerland, France, Britain, Holland and Guinea.
   There were also 21 Liberians, mostly dependents of U.S. citizens.
   ``We are very happy to be here. Our trip was extremely
difficult,'' said Manuel de Luna, the Spanish ambassador. His
nervous face showed signs of relief as he sat in the admiral's
parlor on board the Saipan, moored four miles off Buchanan for the
evacuation operation.
   The foreigners _ many of whom sought refuge in the West German,
Spanish and Italian embassies _ had been trapped on the battle line
in Monrovia's eastern suburbs, where heavy fighting broke out
Friday after Taylor's forces attacked government troops. Rebels
told local residents to leave the area.
   The foreigners left Sunday night in a convoy bound for Buchanan,
about 90 miles southeast of Monrovia.
   The rebels insisted that the Marines arrive unarmed to carry out
the evacuation from a beach in Buchanan.
   While heavily armed rebel troops patrolled the beach, the
evacuees waited in a tropical storm for the helicopters to carry
them to safety.
   Among those evacuated was Jeanette Carter of Colorado, who
lectures in anthropology at the University of Liberia in Monrovia.
   ``People were petrified that the government forces would start
using rockets to get the rebels out of the area'' in Monrovia's
eastern suburbs, she said.
   ``We were frightened of being accused of being rebel
sympathizers by the government. That was a realy worry in case the
rebels withdrew from an area and the government forces returned,''
she said.
   Efforts to ferry the evacuees on by helicopter from the Saipan
to Freetown, Sierra Leone, had to be abandoned because of heavy
rain.
   U.S. Public Affairs Officer Matthew McGrath told reporters in
Freetown that only eight of the evacuees were flown to the Sierra
Leone capital on Monday.
   The Saipan, an amphibious assault helicopter carrier, is one of
four Navy ships off Liberia with a contingent of about 2,100
Marines.
   More than 200 Marines were airlifted to Monrovia on Aug. 5 to
evacuate Americans and protect the U.S. Embassy. Washington has
said they would not intervene in the war in which rebels are
seeking to oust President Samuel Doe.
   Prior to Monday's operation, the United States had only
evacuated those foreign nationals who could reach the U.S. Embassy
in Monrovia. The Marines also rescued American employees at a Voice
of America relay station and U.S. Omega ship-tracking station
behind rebel lines after the evacuations began.

   Two publications alleged Monday that
East Germany's now-dismantled ``Stasi'' secret police murdered a
leading human rights activist and a star athlete after they fled to
West Germany.
   The newspaper Die Welt and the weekly pictorial magazine Bunte
said East Germany's ousted security chief, Erich Mielke, ordered
the deaths.
   West German government spokesman Dieter Vogel prosecutors will
investigate ``confidential tips'' regarding such killings, but that
``it's not yet known whether these tips correspond with the facts.''
   Mielke, 82, is in jail pending investigation of charges he
abused his power and jailed people for criticizing the old
communist government.
   Rights activist Michael Gartenschlaeger, 32, was killed May 1,
1976, while trying to dismantle self-firing guns erected along the
two Germanys' frontier to deter escapes to the West. At the time he
was believed to have been shot by regular East German border guards.
   Die Welt said Mielke's secret police found out in advance what
Gartenschlaeger was up to and had a ``special commando squad''
waiting for him.
   Soccer player Lutz Eigendorf, 26, died in a car crash near the
West German city of Braunschweig on March 5, 1983. Die Welt and
Bunte said East German agents poisoned Eigendorf before the
accident.
   Eigendorf was a former star performer for the East German
national soccer team. Die Welt said Mielke was infuriated by
Eigendorf's 1979 defection to West Germany.

   Jurors in the case of the Central Park jogger
finished a fifth day of deliberations Monday without reaching a
verdict in the vicious gang rape that left her near death.
   Three teen-agers are charged in the case.
   Before recessing for the day, the jury asked to review
photographs of the victim, including one that shows her on a
respirator at a hospital, her head bandaged and her body battered.
   Jurors also asked for a ruler and a piece of string. They did
not explain why they wanted those items. But observers at
trial-level state Supreme Court noted that a Central Park map was
in the jury room and speculated they would use the ruler and string
to measure distances in the park.
   Defendants have given differing accounts of where the attack
took place.
   Later, the jury asked for more photographs of the jogger and the
crime scene, including aerial photos.
   Defendants Raymond Santana, 15, Antron McCray, 16, and Yusef
Salaam, 16, are charged with attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse,
riot, assault and robbery in separate attacks on a woman jogger and
two male joggers during an April 19, 1989, gang rampage in Central
Park.
   According to prosecutors, the woman was jumped and dragged into
the woods, where she was gang-raped, bashed with a brick and a pipe
and left to die.
   The jogger is back at work as an investment banker but her
sight, balance and smell are impaired.

   Opponents of a paid Martin Luther King holiday
for state employees filed petitions Monday seeking a statewide vote
on the issue.
   The holiday opponents needed 43,350 verified voter signatures in
order to force the referendum. The petition filed with the
secretary of state's office carried 71,000 names.
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham, a leader of forces opposing a paid King
holiday for state workers, told cheering supporters that the slain
civil-rights leader was amply honored by an unpaid Sunday holiday
Mecham proclaimed as governor.
   ``I call on everyone to pledge to support the people's right to
make the decision and to abide peacefully by that result of the
people's vote, regardless of which way it goes,'' Mecham said.
   Mecham's successor, Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, issued a
statement meanwhile urging that voters approve the paid holiday and
predicting that business could suffer if the paid holiday is
rejected.
   The issue has been a sore point in Arizona since 1986, when
Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt declared a King holiday. Mecham, who
took office in 1987, rescinded the holiday before it could take
effect.
   The ensuing uproar included marches, tourist boycotts and
convention cancellations. The furor also fueled a petition drive
against Mecham, but he was removed by impeachment on other grounds
before the recall vote could be held.
   In 1989, with backing from Mofford, legislators created a paid
King Day for state workers by cashing in the state's paid Columbus
Day holiday.
   Infuriated Italian-American groups joined forces with
conservatives who believe there shouldn't be a holiday named for
King, and gathered enough signatures to force a vote on the bill in
the November's election.
   Supporters of a paid holiday the third Monday in January marking
King's birthday went back to the Legislature this year and got a
new bill passed. This one would restore Columbus Day as a paid
holiday and keep King Day as a paid holiday. It also would knock
the referendum on the King-for-Columbus swap off the ballot.
   But the 1990 bill is subject to referendum, just like the 1989
one, and opponents of King Day were given 90 days in which to
gather at the 43,350 signatures required to force a referendum.
   Some of those who worked on the 1990 referendum drive said they
believed there shouldn't be a holiday in King's honor because he
was too liberal and because of stories about his personal life.
   Others said declined to take a position on King but believed
voters should have the chance to decide whether to create and pay
for the holiday.
   If the 1990 petitions contain enough valid signatures, both the
1989 and 1990 laws must be placed on the ballot.

   A federal judge was urged Monday to void an
anti-obscenity pledge that artists and institutions must sign
before they can get grants from the National Endowment for the Arts.
   U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton heard oral arguments in a
lawsuit by the New School for Social Research against the
government agency.
   The New School alleges that the pledge is unconstitutionally
vague and violates free speech and due process.
   Stanton was to issue a written later.
   New School's attorney, Floyd Abrams, argued that the requirement
violates the Constitution because grant recipients have to
speculate as to what the endowment considers obscene.
   ``They have to tell us what is expected of us in a
constitutionally permissive way,'' Abrams said.
   He also charged that the right to freedom of speech was
infringed because he said the anti-obscenity ban adopted by
Congress last October was designed to suppress speech the lawmakers
found offensive.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Allan Taffet, arguing for the endowment,
made a brief presentation in which he argued that the NEA was
merely enforcing legislation adopted by Congress.

<HEAD>Soviets Intensify Diplomatic Activity in Persian Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Kremlin intensified its diplomatic activity
regarding the Persian Gulf crisis Monday, meeting with U.S.,
British and Chinese envoys and questioning the Iraqi ambassador on
the exodus of Soviets from the region.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman meanwhile expressed skepticism over
the latest offer by Iraq's President Saddam Hussein to withdraw his
troops from Kuwait.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Belonogov met U.S. Ambassador
Jack Matlock, British Charge d'Affaires David Logan and Chinese
Charge d'Affaires Zhang Zhen to discuss resolving the conflict in
the gulf region, Tass news agency reported. No details of the
meeting were disclosed.
   Igor Belousov, the Soviet official instructed by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to oversee the evacuation of Soviet citizens
from Kuwait and Iraq, messaged the Iraqi leadership on the matter,
Tass said without elaboration.
   It said Belousov also received Iraqi Ambassador Ghafil Jassim
Hussain and questioned him on the evacuation.
   Nearly 9,000 Soviets, including military specialists, are among
the foreigners caught in the two countries following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh told reporters the Soviet
Union ``continues its contacts with Iraq to convince it ... that
the actions taken by Iraq are futile and that it should pull out
its troops.''
   The Soviet Union did not join the United States in rejecting
Saddam's offer to pull his troops out of Kuwait.
   Saddam on Sunday linked any Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait to an
Israeli pullout from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and a
Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon. Israel took the territories from
Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War.
   The United States and Israel quickly rejected the offer but the
Soviet Union waited a day and did not condemn it.
   ``We have to see whether the realization of the conditions are
realistic, and it's doubtful that it's really possible to implement
the conditions,'' Gremitskikh said.
   Saddam's administration received more weapons from the Soviet
Union than any other country. While the Kremlin has condemned his
invasion of Kuwait, it is trying not to antagonize Arab nations and
for years has strongly supported their demand for Israel to
withdraw.
   The Soviet Union has sided with the United States overall in the
conflict, jointly supporting U.N. sanctions against Iraq and
stopping weapons supplies to its old ally.
   On the growing U.S. military presence in the gulf, Gremitskikh
said it was important that the United States ``does not overstep
the sensible limit which is necessary to ensure Saudi Arabia's
sufficient defense.''
   The Defense Ministry said in a statement Monday that Soviet
military help to Iraq was not to be used against third countries.
It said this country ``in recent times supplied only defense
technology'' to Iraq.

   The season's seventh tropical depression had dissipated Sunday
but regained its shape and sped west at 25 mph with top sustained

suburban Coral Gables.
   At 6 p.m. EDT, Fran's center was near 9.3 degrees north latitude

of Trinidad. Tropical storm-force winds of at least 39 mph extended
175 miles from Fran's center.
   The government of Trinidad and Tobago, which weathered an
unsuccessful coup attempt by radical black Moslems two weeks ago,
issued a tropical storm warning for its territory as well as
Grenada and other nearby islands in the southeastern Caribbean.

<HEAD>Hungry Crowds Raid Food Trucks in Peru</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EMERY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crowds of hungry shantytown dwellers have
begun raiding trucks carrying food and stripping fields of produce
on the outskirts of Lima and other Peruvian cities, news reports
said Monday.
   The incidents occurred after the government of new President
Alberto Fujimori announced harsh austerity measures last Wednesday
to control Peru's 3,000 percent annual inflation rate and its
debilitating fiscal deficit.
   Food prices have tripled and in some cases quintupled with the
elimination of subsidies.
   Radioprogramas, Peru's leading radio station, reported that
armed gangs were robbing cars and trucks traveling the Central
Highway to the Mantaro Valley, located in the Andes 120 miles east
of Lima.
   The valley, one of the most fertile agricultural zones in Peru,
is Lima's breadbasket. Maoist Shining Path guerrillas have been
trying for several years to disrupt agricultural production there
to heighten the chaos already reigning in the country.
   Wholesalers in Lima said Monday that they had halted business in
the valley because of reports of attacks on food trucks and looting
in Jauja and Huancayo, the two largest cities in the area.
   Meanwhile, radio stations in the coastal city of Chiclayo, 410
miles northwest of Lima, reported crowds of several hundred people
were robbing trucks carrying agricultural produce on the
Panamerican Highway south of the city.
   A newspaper in Trujillo, Peru's third largest city 300 miles
north of Lima, said crowds were raiding farmland around the city,
stripping the fields of tubers, cauliflower, tomatoes, carrots and
sweet potatoes.
   Another mob broke into Trujillo's principal slaughterhouse and
made off with more than 100 sides of beef, pork and lamb.
   In Lima, several hundred people with picks and shivels pulled
potatoes and produce from fields in farm districts on the north and
east sides of Lima before dawn Saturday.
   News reports also said 40 people, some with revolvers, halted a
truck before dawn Sunday 12 miles north of the capital and stole
400 chickens being taken to market.
   The food riots have stepped up in part because the government
has yet to implement its emergency food program, critics said
Monday.
   Prime Minister Carlos Hurtado Miller, who announced the
austerity measures last week, said the government would provide
more than $400 million in emergency food for Peru's poor the
remainder of the year.
   At least 7 million Peruvians _ one-third the population _ live
in extreme poverty, and four of five adult aged people lack steady
jobs.
   Government-assisted soup kitchens say their budget has been cut
in half. Shantytown community organizations complain they have
received no government aid, despite Hurtado's pledge.

   A surrogate mother on Monday began a
custody battle with the couple whose test-tube fetus she is
carrying, saying they were callous about her health and wouldn't
provide a good home for the child.
   Anna Johnson, 29, is seeking custody of the baby that she could
deliver in one to two months. Attorneys on both sides of the case
said it might establish a new legal definition of parenthood.
   ``It is Anna and her body that are responsible for this child.
... It is Anna's position that she is the biological parent,''
although she didn't provide the baby's genetic material, said
Johson's attorney, Diane Marlowe.
   Johnson, a licensed vocational nurse, is on disability leave
because of complications of the pregnancy that twice hospitalized
her, once to receive medication to stop contractions.
   In the lawsuit she filed in Santa Ana superior court Monday,
Johnson also sought child support and damages for emotional
distress.
   The couple, in their mid-30s and identified in the lawsuit as
Mark and Crispina Calvert, provided the sperm and egg to create the
embryo that was then transferred from a laboratory dish to
Johnson's womb. Mrs. Calvert was unable to carry a child because
she had a hysterectomy.
   At a news conference, they denied Johnson's allegations they had
ignored her medical needs and failed to make timely payments.
   Mrs. Calvert said Johnson had tried to speed up payment of the
$10,000 fee that she was to receive for carrying the baby, which
the couple said is a boy.
   ``I was surprised that she did this to us,'' she said. ``We
thought that we had a good relationship after all I've done for
her.''
   ``Chris and Mark both feel their child is being held hostage,''
said attorney Christian Van Deusen.
   ``This is still a miracle baby. The end results will be worth
going through what we're going through,'' Calvert said.
   ``The problem is not money. The problem is fetal neglect. And
they will have to address that in court,'' said Richard Gilbert,
another of Johnson's attorneys.
   A single parent with a 3-year-old daughter, Johnson said she had
seen the surrogate contract as a way to put herself through
graduate nursing school. She and Mrs. Calvert, also a nurse, worked
at the same hospital in the Orange County city of Santa Ana.
   Van Deusen said Johnson's effort to pursue custody of a baby
that has no biological relation to her is unprecedented.
   ``It's definitely going to be new ground turned,'' said Van
Deusen. ``This is where the arguments will have to focus: what
constitutes parenthood?''
   Gilbert agreed. Although California law presumes that the birth
mother is the legal parent, a judge has discretion in deciding a
case, he said.
   ``I'm sure this will be one of the most difficult decisions the
judge will ever have to make,'' Gilbert said.
   In the highly publicized Baby M custody case in New Jersey, the
child was conceived by a surrogate mother, Mary Beth Whitehead,
with the sperm of a man whose wife couldn't have a baby.
   Whitehead decided to renege on the arrangement, prompting a
bitter custody fight. It was won in 1988 by the father, William
Stern, and his wife, Elizabeth, who live with the 3-year-old girl
in Tenafly, N.J.

   Security forces opened
fire on protesters Monday at the start of a two-day strike over
government-imposed price increases. Police said two people were
killed and two others wounded.
   The general strike, organized by nine unions, paralyzed this
Caribbean nation of 7 million people. Stores, factories and
government offices were closed and most public transportation was
halted.
   Police said about 300 people were arrested in the capital of
Santo Domingo and four other cities.
   In Santo Domingo, one man was killed and two were injured when
police and soldiers opened fire on protesters who erected flaming
barricades and threw rocks and bottles at cars, according to
police. Security forces also used tear gas and clubs to disperse
protesters.
   Police said another man was killed during a similar violent
demonstration in San Cristobal, 17 miles west of the capital.
   Unions organized the nationwide work stoppage to protest steep
price rises for basic consumer goods announced Wednesday by the
government of President Joaquin Balaguer.
   The announcement prompted three days of violent protests in
which five people were wounded by police, stores were looted and
200 people were arrested, according to police.
   Balaguer, 83, who is to be inaugurated Thursday to a second
consecutive four-year term, lifted government subsidies, causing
prices to rise, as part of an austerity program recommended by the
International Monetary Fund.
   Gasoline prices rose by 83.6 percent, flour 95.8 percent and
sugar 75 percent, among other increases.
   The government said Saturday it would announce later this week
price freezes on 30 items to offset the increases.
   In 1984, during the last austerity program implemented by a
government, disturbances lasted three days and more than 100 people
died.
   The conservative Balaguer narrowly defeated his longtime leftist
rival, former President Juan Bosch, in a disputed election May 16.

   About 300 weary wives and children of oil workers flew to
Houston from their adopted Saudi homes on Monday, and a businessman
who fled Iraq after the Kuwait invasion said he would form a group
to help stranded Americans.
   A State Department spokeswoman said Monday that about 500
Americans have managed to flee Kuwait since Aug. 2.
   Among them were a Las Vegas dance troupe, guests of the Kuwaiti
royal family, who were awakened before dawn by their hosts to flee
across the burning sands to Saudi Arabia. Another woman described
being led across the border by a Bedouin guide.
   The group that arrived in Houston on a 20-hour flight from
Riyadh via Amsterdam included 8-year-old Nathan Gildersleeve, who
said he left his father behind in Saudi Arabia ``because I missed
my mother.''
   ``It's good to be home,'' said Linda Gunter of El Paso. ``We
just wish our husbands were with us.''
   Aramco Services Co., a petroleum services firm, arranged for the
flight to return children home for the fall school term and to
allow others concerned for their safety to come home.
   Michael Saba, a businessman who was in Baghdad at the time of
the invasion, said he would use his connections in the region to
help stranded Americans get out through a group he is forming
called the Coming Home Committee.
   ``Of course, all of us who were kind of stranded in Iraq were
tense, waiting to see what was going to happen,'' said Saba,
president of GulfAmerica International Business Services of
Champaign, Ill. ``But, I do want to point out that the Iraqis
treated us very well.''
   Saba said he has visited the families of Americans still
stranded in Iraq and Kuwait and would work with the State
Department and private humanitarian groups.
   ``We feel strongly that private efforts need to be made,'' said
Saba. ``We'll be working as individuals and we're accepting
donations to pay for phone calls, postage, tickets home and the
like.''
   Saba and another U.S. businessman paid $100 on Wednesday for an
eight-hour taxi ride from their Baghdad hotel to the border between
Iraq and Jordan, then hitchhiked across the Jordanian desert to
Amman.
   Saba said Iraqi troops stopped the taxi once and checked
passports, but made no effort to prevent him from leaving.
   Many foreigners stayed behind because they were unsure whether
the border was open, Saba said. Iraqi declarations on the subject
have been contradictory and confusing.
   Saba said he was staying at the Sheraton Hotel at the time of
the invasion, and was moved by the government to the Rashid, a
luxurious hotel with beautiful grounds, a swimming pool, a gourmet
restaurant and bowling alley.
   He recalled lighter moments such as eating Del Monte bananas in
the hotel lounge while listening to a piped-in song with the
lyrics: ``Please release me, let me go.''
   A seven-member American dance troupe, staying in a beach villa
as the guests of the Kuwaiti royal family, were awakened moments
after the Iraqi invasion by their hosts and helped to flee, said
Shirley Rankin, the mother of one of the dancers.
   Suzette Rankin, 19, of Las Vegas, and the other dancers were in
Kuwait to give a performance for the U.S. ambassador and the emir
of Bahrain, Mrs. Rankin said.
   It was the 19-year-old's first trip overseas, her mother said.
   ``Needless to say we didn't expect this much of an adventure,''
she said. A Saudi hotel at first refused to allow the dancers to
register because they were unaccompanied, Mrs. Rankin said. But the
intervention of a British diplomat resolved the quandary.
   Ramona Magee, 30, of San Diego, said a Kuwaiti Bedouin had
helped her and a British companion, Anita Rawlinson, escape from
Kuwait to Saudi Arabia shortly after the invasion.
   ``We drove south across the desert on hard sand to avoid the
main roads,'' Magee, a marketing manager for a Kuwaiti firm, said
in a telephone interview from London with The San Diego Union.
   The group was at once point turned back from the Saudi border,
but Iraqi soldiers finally let them pass, she said.

<HEAD>Witness Says Israeli Commander Ordered Beatings as Punishment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A general testified on Thursday that Maj. Gen.
Amram Mitzna, former army commander of the occupied West Bank,
ordered Palestinian rioters beaten as punishment, in violation of
army policy at the time.
   Brig. Gen. Benny Tahan also told a military court he heard
Mitzna order demonstrators' limbs broken, according to Israel radio.
   Mitzna was West Bank commander when the Palestinian uprising
against Israeli rule began in December 1987.
   Tahan was a defense witness for Col. Yehuda Meir, 37, who is
being court-martialed on charges of ordering soldiers to break the
bones of Palestinian detainees. Meir faces 20 years in prison if
convicted. The trial resumed Monday after a vacation recess.
   The radio said Tahan testified, ``I heard with my own ears
Mitzna order beatings to deter and punish. ... He even used the
expression `break their hands and legs.''
   Israeli military authorities introduced beatings to deter Arab
demonstrators a month after the uprising began. The practice was
phased out after proving ineffective and drawing criticism.
   As a prosecution witness, Mitzna testified in May that beatings
were to be administered solely to disperse protestors and control
detainees. He described Meir's actions as ``blacker than black.''
   Meir swore that former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin gave
orders in January 1988 to break the bones of Palestinian inciters
as punishment. He said Mitzna attended meetings with Rabin and did
not object to the ``policy of the beatings.''
   Military prosecutors say soldiers acting on Meir's orders
arrested about 21 Palestinians in two West Bank villages in January
1988, took them into nearby fields, bound and gagged them and beat
them with rifles and clubs.
   At least 12 of the Palestinians reportedly suffered broken limbs.
   Also Monday, unidentified security sources said they foiled a
plot last June to explode a car bomb at Jerusalem's government
compound that houses the prime minister's office, Israel television
reported.
   It quoted them as saying Wail Mohammed Salameh, 31, a Jordanian
citizen, was charged with planning to steal a car, fill it with 66
pounds of dynamite and blow it up as workers were leaving for home.
   The TV report said he was caught a week before the planned
attack, and that according to the charge sheet, Salameh was trained
and sent by Fatah, the mainstream faction of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.

   Trucks filled the navy dockyard
Monday as Canada scrambled to get three warships ready for duty in
the Persian Gulf region.
   ``I don't think there was a flatbed truck in the country east of
Winnipeg that wasn't used this past weekend for this operation,''
said navy Capt. Roger Chaisson, who commands 1,700 civilian workers
at the ship repair unit.
   Four Phalanx anti-missile guns were among the issue sent to
Halifax after Prime Minister Brian Mulroney announced Friday the
ships would join a multinational fleet. The guns, whose computers
and twin radars direct up to 3,000 rounds a minute at incoming
missiles or aircraft, were stored at Saint John, New Brunswick, and
Lauzon, Quebec, for frigates still under construction.
   One Phalanx each will be put aboard the destroyers Athabaskan
and Terra Nova. Two will be mounted on the supply ship Protecteur.
   Dockyard workers were toiling around the clock in shifts.
   The commodore heading the task force, Ken Summers, said he
expected the vessels would leave Halifax by the middle of next week.
   The ships are 18 to 30 years old.
   The navy's senior surgeon, Capt. Larry Myette, was assembling a
team of 15 to 20 doctors, nurses and technicians. They were
equipped to treat everything from food poisoning to combat
injuries, including chemical weapons, he said.
   Iraq reportedly has mass quantities of chemical arms such as
mustard gas, which it reportedly used on Kurdish separatists and
during the Iran-Iraq war.

   An electrical fire knocked out power to the
skyscrapers of Manhattan's financial district Monday, disrupting
stock trading, stranding people in elevators and sending thousands
home early through traffic-snarled streets.
   Consolidated Edison said power could be out for several days in
a commercial area of roughly 50 square blocks.
   The midday cable fire at a Con Ed substation spewed plumes of
black acrid smoke into the air over the southern tip of Manhattan.
Workers poured out of buildings like the World Trade Center and
South Street Seaport in search of pay phones and cool drinks.
   Many subway lines and commuter tunnels were stalled or shut
down; thousands walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and rush-hour
ferry service began early.
   The outage affected 4,150 customers, mostly businesses employing
tens and possibly hundreds of thousands of employees.
   After issuing a plea for consumers to cut energy use, the
utility restored power to about three-quarters of the affected area
by 5 p.m. by re-routing current through other substations, said Con
Ed spokeswoman Pat Richardi.
   But power could be out for several days in one mostly commercial
area, Richardi said. No power in tall buildings also generally
means no water, since the pumps aren't working, the utility said.
   The section stretches from just below the Brooklyn Bridge to
Wall Street and from William Street to the East River. It includes
such landmarks as the South Street Seaport and the Fulton Fish
Market.
   Monday afternoon, pedestrian traffic was so thick it overflowed
from the sidewalk onto the street, which was clogged with buses and
taxis. Traffic lights were shut off so police directed traffic by
hand.
   ``The evening rush hour is ruined,'' said Transit Authority
spokesman Jared Lebow. ``We have so many trains backed up, it's
like putting water through a eye dropper.''
   The New York Stock Exchange was unaffected by the outage,
spokesman Ray Pellechia said. But the American Stock Exchange, New
York Mercantile Exchange and Commodity Exchange all halted trading
for the day at 1 p.m.
   Hundreds of people were stuck in elevators at the World Trade
Center for up to 2{ hours, said D. Joy Faber, a spokeswoman for the
Port Authority, which operates the 110-story twin skyscrapers, the
tallest buildings in the city.
   ``My legs are buckling. I feel so sore,'' secretary Ethel Levine
said after walking down 33 floors.
   Steve and Carol Holett, visiting from Los Angeles, were on the
36th floor of 1 World Trade Center when the lights began blinking
and then went off for good. They decided to walk down because they
didn't want to spend their only day in town stuck in an office.
   William Unroch, stuck inside his high-rise home at Battery Park
City, was not as lucky.
   ``It's horrible here. All the gas is off, the water is off,
everything is off. I'm trapped here on the 35th floor. I can't get
out of my apartment. I'd have to walk down 35 flights.''
   Others made the best of the situation.
   ``It's the first time I've walked across the bridge. It's pretty
nice,'' said Joseph Eckart, an insurance company employee who
strolled the Brooklyn span that crosses the East River, holding
hands with his girlfriend, Angela Rizzica.
   ``We feel like it's seventh grade and we've gotten a day off,''
said engineer John Gratten.
   The fire at Con Ed's Seaport substation on Front Street was
reported at 11:50 a.m. and escalated to a four-alarm fire by 3
p.m., said Fire Department spokeswoman Joe McGee. It was declared
under control at 5:25 p.m.
   The cause wasn't known, McGee said.
   Some 125 firefighters, including a decontamination and hazardous
materials unit, helped fight the fire. Seventeen firefighters were
treated for smoke and exhaustion, said Marilyn Bernard, a Fire
Department spokeswoman.
   Experts tested for dangerous gases, but Tina Casey of the
Department of Environmental Protection said later that tests had
been negative.

   The government of Soviet Armenia resigned Monday,
and the republic's parliament elected a nationalist as the new
prime minister, the Tass news agency reported.
   Lawmakers elected Vazgen Manukyan, a leader of the Armenian
National Movement, as prime minister by a vote of 170-35, Tass said.
   He replaces Vladimir Markaryants, who submitted his resignation
earlier in the day, along with that of his government, Armenian
radio reported.
   Manukyan, 44, was nominated as prime minister by Armenian
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who on Aug. 4 was elected to his
post by the parliament.
   Both new leaders were prominent figures in the Armenian National
Movement and the Karabakh Committee, a group seeking Armenian
control over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is
inside neighboring Azerbaijan.
   With Manukyan's election, Ter-Petrosyan told the parliament,
``We have proved we have a strong power that should become a
guarantee of stability of the political situation in the
republic,'' the Interfax news service reported.
   Manukyan is expected to form a new cabinet within a month, Tass
said.
   Hundreds of people have been killed the last two years in ethnic
clashes between Christian Armenians and Moslem Azerbaijanis over
control of the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. The mostly Armenian
region has been controlled by Azerbaijan since the 1920s.

<DATELINE>GUAYMAS, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Storms and flooding have left two people
dead and forced almost 2,000 people to flee to temporary shelters
in the northwestern state of Sonora, officials said Monday.
   Roads were flooded in the Gulf of California port of Guaymas,
isolating it from other towns inland, said Mirolava Villa, a
spokeswoman for the Guaymas police. The dock was still open.
   Many people were being housed in temporary shelters, churches
and schools, she said. Scores of wooden homes were destroyed.
   Although the rain had stopped by Monday afternoon, some Guaymas
streets were under 10 feet of water, Ms. Villa said.
   Flooding was less severe in the nearby city of Empalme, which is
at a higher elevation, she said. The main road to the popular
tourist community of San Carlos was open.
   Many of those rescued and taken to shelters were traveling on
Highway 15 between Guaymas and Hermosillo, the capital of Sonora
about 70 miles to the north. Parts of the road were under water.
   More than 400 medical and volunteer assistants were flown in to
Guaymas, said Beatriz Rodriguez Samudio, a Red Cross volunteer in
Guaymas.
   Food and other necessities were also being airlifted into
Guaymas.
   Most telephone lines were either out of order or jammed by
calls, and many residents were communicating by radio, she said.
   Guaymas is about 230 miles south of the Mexico-U.S. border city
of Nogales.

<HEAD>Drug Lords to Keep Truce Despite Killing of Cartel Member</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN GUTKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug traffickers said Monday they will
hold to the cease-fire they declared last month despite the killing
by police of Gustavo Gaviria, a major leader of the Medellin
cocaine cartel.
   The pledge came in a statement sent to local news media and
bearing the letterhead the ``Extraditables,'' as the cartel calls
itself.
   The statement said Gaviria was unarmed and was executed by
police last Saturday, not killed in a shootout as officials said.
   ``Arrest warrants have become execution orders,'' it claimed.
   Gaviria, considered the No. 3 man in the cartel, was shot by
members of an elite anti-narcotics police unit at his luxury
apartment in southern Medellin.
   The Extraditables said they still would continue the truce they
declared July 27 in their year-old war against the government.
   ``Our cease-fire is indefinite and our desire for peace is
unshakable,'' the statement said.
   Officials had feared terrorist attacks would follow Gaviria's
killing. After his death, police in Medellin and the capital,
Bogota, were put on maximum alert.
   The cartel has been blamed for killing about 500 Colombians the
past year in bombings and assassinations.
   Police operations director Gen. Octavio Vargas said in
statements published in a Bogota newspaper Monday that authorities
had wanted to capture Gaviria alive, hoping he could lead them to
Pablo Escobar, boss of the Medellin cartel.
   Vargas said security troops tailed Gaviria for 20 days, finally
moving in because they feared he would discover the secret
intelligence operation against him.
   Observers say drug traffickers may be waiting to see if
Colombia's new president, Cesar Gaviria (no relation to Gustavo),
will continue extraditing accused drug smugglers to the United
States _ a fate the drug lords fear most.

<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union filed
suit Monday challenging a sales ban on ``As Nasty As They Wanna
Be,'' the album by rap group 2 Live Crew.
   The suit filed in Richland County Circuit Court asks for a
prohibition on arrests for the sale of the album. It also asks that
a judge decide whether the album is obscene.
   Richland prosecutor Jim Anders, who in June threatened to
prosecute those selling the album, is named as the defendant. Three
record stores have joined the ACLU as plaintiffs, said Steve Bates,
executive director for the South Carolina ACLU.
   Anders welcomes the suit's request for a determination on
whether the material is obscene, he said, adding, ``I think it
ought to apply statewide.''
   Joe Watson, prosecutor for Greenville and Pickens counties, has
also threatened prosecution of stores who sell ``Nasty.''
   Bates said the record ``has significant literary, artistic and
political values that reflect the African and Afro-American
heritage of a large segment of our population.''
   He acknowledged that 2 Live Crew's use of raw and sometimes
violent sexual imagery in songs like ``Me So Horny'' made it
``tough to argue this.''
   By South Carolina standards, Anders said, the album is obscene.
The ACLU is a group that wants ``anything to go,'' he said.
   A person found selling obscene material under state law could be
subject to a maximum fine of $5,000 and five years imprisonment.
   The group has been at the center of a First Amendment-obscenity
battle since June, when group members were arrested in Hollywood,
Fla., after they performed songs from the album in a nightclub.
   A federal judge in Florida declared the album obscene.
   Selling ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' has also been banned in
the city of Aiken, and the city of Charleston in July kept a
city-owned outlet from selling tickets to a 2 Live Crew performance
at a private auditorium.
   The controversy is helping 2 Live Crew's sales nationwide.
   The group's ``Banned in the U.S.A.'' album, a free-speech anthem
based on the Bruce Springsteen song, ``Born in the U.S.A.,'' has
sold nearly a million copies.

<TEXT>
   A moderately strong earthquake shook the
Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage Monday, knocking objects from
store shelves and rattling residents as far as 400 miles away,
authorities said.
   The quake measured 5.6 on the Richter scale, according to the
Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer and the Alaska Earthquake
Information Center in Fairbanks. A quake of that magnitude is
capable of causing considerable local damage in the right
conditions.
   Those agencies and police in Homer and the other main peninsula
town of Kenai said there were no reports of damage or injuries.
   ``Everything was dancing _ it felt like the roof was coming
in,'' said Fran Skaggs, who works at Ulmer's Rexall drugstore in
Homer.
   ``There were quite a few things falling off the shelves,''
Skaggs said. ``We didn't lose anything _ there's just a few piles
of things here and there that need to be cleaned up.''
   The quake, at 3:04 p.m., was centered between Homer and
Ninilchik, said Charlotte Rowe, a seismologist at the Earthquake
Information Center. The area _ a popular vacation spot some 110
miles southwest of Anchorage _ is one of the more populous parts of
the sparsely settled state.
   It was felt strongly in Anchorage and also in Fairbanks, 400
miles to the north.
   The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.,
gave the quake a Richter reading of 5.3, said spokeswoman Pat
Jorgensen.
   Dispatcher Sam Brown of the Kenai Police Department said she
hadn't received any calls about the earthquake.
   ``We felt a big jolt and things started shaking pretty good,''
she said.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.

<HEAD>Scientist Says Blood-Alcohol Not Enough to Judge Impairment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evidence of alcohol in the blood doesn't
always mean a person is impaired, a behavioral scientist testified
Monday at the trial of three former Northwest Airlines pilots
charged with flying while intoxicated.
   James Wilson, a psychology professor at the University of
Colorado at Boulder, testified for the defense that impairment by
alcohol varies from person to person. Some test subjects, he said,
have been unimpaired with a blood-alcohol content as high as .10
percent, he said.
   ``Everybody is different,'' he said. ``A lot of people dosed
(with alcohol) are steadier than a lot of people sober.''
   Wilson's testimony in the trial of Capt. Norman Lyle Prouse, 1st
Officer Robert Kirchner and flight engineer Joseph Balzer
conflicted with the testimony of a prosecution witness. Herbert
Moskowitz, also a behavioral scientist, told the federal jury last
week that all people are impaired beginning with alcohol
concentrations as low as .01 percent.
   The three pilots are accused of flying a Boeing 727 on March 8
from Fargo, N.D., to the Twin Cities while under the influence of
alcohol they drank the night before at a lounge in Moorhead.
Blood-alcohol tests taken two hours after Flight 650 landed showed
blood-alcohol concentrations of .13 percent for Prouse, .08 percent
for Balzer and .06 percent for Kirchner.
   The pilots are being tried in U.S. District Court on charges of
operating an aircraft while under the influence of alcohol. The
case marks the first time that commercial pilots have been tried
under the 1988 federal law provision prohibiting operation of a
common carrier while under the influence of alcohol.
   Unlike state drunken-driving laws, the federal law doesn't
specify an illegal blood-alcohol content. To find the pilots
guilty, jurors must conclude they were impaired by alcohol despite
their apparently solid performance.
   Prouse has said he is an alcoholic with a built-up tolerance.
   Wilson testified that there are three types of tolerance to
alcohol: chronic, acute and innate. People who drink heavily can
develop chronic tolerances and the children of alcoholics are
sometimes innately tolerant of the drug, he said.
   In addition, people can become more tolerant to alcohol during a
single drinking session, he said. He said all three types of
tolerance can be at work in the same person, making it possible for
a drinker to be unimpaired after significant doses of alcohol.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth de la Vega asked Wilson if he
thought it would be safe for a pilot with a blood-alcohol content
of .15 percent to fly a passenger jet.
   ``Very possibly,'' Wilson said.
   She asked if it would be more safe if that pilot was an
alcoholic.
   ``Quite likely,'' he said.
   Thomas Burr, an expert on alcohol testing who also testified
Monday for the defense, said alcohol impaired only about half of
the people he has seen tested to have blood-alcohol concentrations
between .05 percent and .08 percent.

<HEAD>Founder of Earth First! Disavows Organization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the founders of Earth First! is
leaving the radical environmental group because he believes it is
being pulled too far to the left, he said in a report published
Monday.
   Dave Foreman, 42, told the Santa Rosa Press Democrat the group
has been tilted beyond its environmental ethic into a ``leftist''
arena by ``yippies and hippies.''
   Foreman, who once supported Republican Gov. Barry Goldwater,
said he doesn't want any hard feelings with his fellow
environmentalists.
   ``I just want a no-fault divorce,'' Foreman said.
   Foreman's disavowal seemed to threaten a split within Earth
First!, a loose-knit movement that hasn't got a formal membership
list but circulates a monthly journal to at least 15,000 people.
   Foreman maintained that the movement's emerging leaders,
including the Northern California promoters of the Redwood Summer
campaign to disrupt logging, are ``more interested in the wildness
within than the wildness out in the forests''
   He said he began to pull back from his highly visible role in
Earth First! a few years ago, partly because of his disenchantment
with the growing influence of activists like movement co-founder
Mike Roselle of Berkeley and Judi Bari of Mendocino County.
   ``I'm not feeling we share the same style,'' Foreman said. ``We
have very different strategies.''
   Earth First! is generally split into two factions, one of which
wants to stick to the original goal of disrupting activities seen
as harmful to nature. The other, based in Northern California,
prefers more traditional peaceful protests but also would broaden
its activism to wider social issues.
   Several followers and key organizers, including Foreman, are
either under indictment or face possible criminal charges stemming
from pipe bombings, tree spikings and an alleged plot to shut down
nuclear plants in Arizona, California and Colorado.
   In May, Bari and group member Darryl Cheney were injured when a
pipe bomb exploded in her car.
   ``Dave Foreman wants Earth First! to remain small, pure and
radical. I want it to be big, impure and radical,'' said Bari. She
said she wants to go beyond ``eco-defense tactics'' like tree
spiking and vandalizing heavy-duty logging equipment.
   ``Profound social changes don't come about without a mass
movement,'' she said.
   Roselle accused Foreman of ``red-baiting,'' and said he was ``a
retired old man out on the lecture circuit.''
   ``We don't need Foreman in Earth First! if he's going to be an
unrepentant right-wing thug,'' Roselle said. ``We're going to keep
doing what we think is best, and that's raise these issues and
confront the industries that are trying to exploit our last wild
lands.''
   Foreman, a former lobbyist, helped found Earth First! a decade
ago with four other conservationists. He said he may issue a public
letter of resignation this week.
   Despite the leadership split, Roselle said, the fast-changing
Earth First! movement retains a ``formidable grassroots nationwide
network that's intent on saving wilderness and old-growth forests.
That's been our priority and will remain so.''

   The Persian Gulf war of wills settled into one of economic
attrition Monday as an Iraqi oil tanker was unable to dock or load
at a Saudi Arabian port. A barricade of U.S. warships stood ready
to block all trade with Iraq.
   ``The purpose of the embargo is to put the pinch on them'' so
the Iraqis cannot ``maintain their war machine,'' said White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``You don't give them the essentials that enable them to carry
on the war,'' Fitzwater said. He said the embargo covers food
imports as well as military supplies and other goods.
   An international quarantine was imposed against Iraq for its
lightning conquest of Kuwait and its massing of troops near Saudi
Arabia, which has the world's largest oil reserves. Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein launched the Aug. 2 blitzkrieg in a dispute over
oil, land and money.
   The New York Times in Tuesday's editions reported Iraq had
transferred $3 billion to $4 billion in confiscated gold bullion,
currency and goods from Kuwaiti institutions to Baghdad, sizeably
increasing its financial reserves. The paper quoted Arab bankers in
London and the gulf in its report.
   Fitzwater said the naval barricade against Iraq had forced two
or three ships to turn back at sea, and ``the embargo is being
maintained'' on shipping into and out of Iraq.
   Pakistan voted to send troops Monday to help defend Saudi
Arabia, joining ground forces from the United States, Egypt,
Morocco and Syria. Squadrons of warplanes and a multinational
armada, joined Monday by warships from Belgium and the Netherlands,
have also massed in the region since the invasion.
   ``I think our position grows stronger with each day that goes
by,'' said Maj. Gen. Don L. Kaufman, chief of the U.S. military
training mission to Saudi Arabia. He said planes ferrying U.S.
troops and equipment were landing every 10 minutes or so at a base
in the desert.
   Saddam called for a ``holy war'' against the Saudi royalty and
Western forces now gathering. Over the weekend, he asked Iraqis to
cut their meat consumption by half and refrain from hoarding food.
Black marketeers will be executed, he warned.
   The Iraqi tanker al-Qaddisiyah, which can hold 900,000 barrels
of oil, was prevented from docking at the Saudi terminal at Yanbu
on the Red Sea because tugs necessary to guide ships did not
appear, according to Saudi diplomatic sources who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   If tankers cannot load, it cuts off, in effect, Iraq's last
major oil export outlet _ a pipeline across the Arabian peninsula
from Iraq. Turkey closed two pipelines carrying Iraqi oil last
week. However, a smaller Iraqi pipeline to Jordan was reported
operating normally Monday.
   Earlier, two other tankers voluntarily joined the boycott. Ships
from Norway and India were scheduled to fill up at the Yanbu
terminal, but the customers did not show up after the U.N.
resolution.
   Also, the Iraqi oil tanker Tarik ibn Ziyad was denied access to
a Portuguese repair yard and cruised toward international waters,
officials said in Lisbon. The work was contracted before the
crisis, but Portugal said it would violate a trade embargo.
   Economic sanctions against Iraq were imposed by the United
Nations and endorsed by 12 members of the Arab League. Besides the
pipeline, normal road transport was reported continuing between
Iraq and Jordan, a friendly neighbor on Iraq's western border.
Jordan's main exports to Iraq are agricultural.
   Iraq is heavily dependent on oil exports to buy food _ it
imports about three-quarters of its basic foodstuffs _ and supplies
for its 17 million people. An international quarantine is designed
to hurt Iraq economically and force it to withdraw from Kuwait.
   In an Associated Press poll, 64 percent of the Americans
contacted supported Bush's decision to commit U.S. troops to
protect Saudi Arabia.
   However, 86 percent said oil companies were taking advantage of
the situation when they raised gasoline prices, and 52 percent said
they believe the gulf crisis is likely to create real oil shortages
and long lines at service stations.
   Meanwhile, the Japanese Trade Ministry made some belt-tightening
proposals to save oil. It asked that office thermostats be set no
lower than 82 degrees and that lighting be reduced by one-third.
About 70 percent of the country's oil comes from the Middle East.
   President Bush said the U.S. Navy would halt Iraqi tankers to
``stop the oil from coming out.'' Britain and Australia also said
they would help interdict Iraqi ships.
   The United States said such action is authorized by the U.N.
vote condemning Iraq's invasion, but referred to it as an
interdiction rather than a blockade, which is a word used in time
of war.
   Bush, vacationing in Kennebunkport, Maine, will return to
Washington Tuesday for two days of talks on the gulf crisis and the
U.S. budget deficit.
   In a related development, Bush ordered Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney to fly to Saudi Arabia on Friday and meet with the kingdom's
leaders, the Pentagon said Monday. It will be his second trip to
the region since the invasion and followup blockade.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Monday only
the Security Council has the right to impose a blockade.
   The Security Council is awaiting a report from a special
committee about compliance with the embargo before deciding whether
to call for a blockade to enforce the embargo.
   Both the U.N. embargo and the U.S. quarantine include all
foodstuffs and grain shipments, except in cases of distress and
humanitarian aid, U.N. and U.S. officials at the United Nations
emphasized on Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In Jordan, border officials said 30 Soviets and four Germans
crossed from Iraq after an overland journey through the desert.
   Up to 3,100 Americans are among the foreigners trapped inside
Iraq and Kuwait. The State Department said Monday about 500
Americans quietly slipped out of Kuwait after the Iraqi conquest,
lowering to 2,500 the official estimate of Americans still there.
Up to 600 Americans remain stranded in Iraq.
   A trickle of American diplomatic personnel was allowed to leave
Iraq but ``it does not appear that any non-official citizens are
being allowed to leave,'' Fitzwater said.
   Meanwhile, Yemen on Monday backed Saddam's peace initiative that
linked a settlement of the gulf crisis to Israel's withdrawal from
Arab territories occupied in the 1967 war. Israel and the United
States rejected the idea.
   Tehran TV, monitored in Cyprus, said Iranian leaders on Monday
rejected Saddam's proposal linking a settlement of the crisis in
part with resolution of a border dispute with Iran.
   Thousands marched in pro-Saddam rallies in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and celebrated him as a national hero who would deliver
by force what diplomacy failed to achieve.
   Several thousand Sudanese marched Monday through Khartoum in
support of Saddam and demanded the withdrawal of foreign troops
from Arab lands. The demonstrators marched to the American Embassy
where they chanted ``Down, down U.S.A., go away C.I.A.''

<HEAD>Greenwich Residents Speak Out About Signs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 300 people showed up at a
public hearing Monday night to support a millionaire who spray
paints real estate signs and to tell town officials they want all
such signs eliminated.
   Rene Anselmo, who was charged last month for spray-painting a
real estate sign, drew cheers and applause as he told town
residents the signs are unsightly and should be banned.
   ``The fault is with the town for 90 percent of this pollution,''
Anselmo said, referring to the signs.
   The signs are just the ``tip of the iceberg'' in the destruction
of the town's pristine landscape, he said.
   ``They (Greenwich residents) didn't move here to live in a sea
of signs,'' he said, drawing loud applause.
   He cited chain link fences as another aesthetic problem
troubling this elite suburb of New York City. He also recently
offered to replace, at his expense, metal highway signs with more
attractive, wooden ones.
   The town's Board of Selectmen called Monday's public meeting
after the recent outcry over Anselmo's arrest on July 3.
   The 64-year-old owner of a television satellite company became
an instant folk hero when he obliterated a real estate sign with
spray paint and was charged with third-degree criminal mischief in
the incident.
   Out of dozens of speakers, only one supported of signs.
   Benjamin Rowe of Preferred Properties said Anselmo had painted
one of his signs.
   ``Mr. Anselmo is probably a saint to everybody, but I'm the guy
who's had his sign painted on, so I don't love him,'' Rowe said.
   At that point, someone in the crowd yelled, ``Take up a
collection.''
   The town's zoning regulations say homeowners can place signs on
their land, but cannot place them on town-owned property, which is
the land adjacent to the road.
   Anselmo, who has lived in town for 23 years, last year donated
$40,000 to the town to plant trees and pays annually for the
planting of flowers on town property.
   After his arrest, Anselmo submitted to the town's zoning
enforcement officer a list of 127 signs he deemed offensive.
   He has pleaded innocent and a trial in the case is set for Aug.
24 in Stamford Superior Court. The charge carries a maximum penalty
of a $1,000 fine and six months in prison.

<HEAD>U.S. Journalists Travel to Saudi Arabia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. journalists left aboard an Air Force
cargo plane Aug. 12 for Saudi Arabia to join American troops.
   Before leaving the United States, they were briefed by Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the U.S. Central Command, at
MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa, Fla.
   Journalists had protested to the Pentagon that U.S. troops
arrived in Saudi Arabia without American reporters allowed into the
country to cover their activities. Defense Department officials had
promised to work on the matter.
   Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug. 2, then moved toward that country's
border with Saudi Arabia. On Aug. 7, the United States dispatched
troops to Saudi Arabia to defend the oil-rich kingdom against a
possible Iraqi incursion. But no pool of American news reporters
was organized to accompany the American forces to view the
situation first-hand.
   U.S. officials said Saudi officials established the ground rules
that kept U.S. journalists out of the kingdom.
   When U.S. forces invaded Panama last December, a small group of
American journalists accompanied the troops. The reporters were
selected in advance by their employers and pledged to keep their
movement secret to protect the security of the military operation.
   But journalists complained that the Pentagon pool did not work
in Panama, where reporters were kept away from the action.
   The arrangement was set up after the U.S. invasion of Grenada,
when journalists were kept away from the Caribbean nation entirely.
   Journalists from The Associated Press, Reuters, United Press
International, Scripps-Howard News Service, Cable News Network,
National Public Radio, the Milwaukee Journal, the Los Angeles Times
and Time Magazine are in the pool.

<HEAD>Middle East Crisis Boosts Network News Ratings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public interest in the Middle East crisis
boosted the ratings for the three network evening news shows by 15
percent Aug. 6 through Aug. 8, a CBS research executive said.
   The 24-hour Cable News Network also said its coverage has
boosted ratings, with the highest daily average recorded on Aug. 8
_ a 1.5 rating that represents 831,000 homes. It was more than
double CNN's audience this quarter.
   That rating, based on Nielsen audience estimates, was CNN's
highest since its coverage of the U.S. invasion of Panama last
December, said CNN spokesman John Bianchi.
   ``The American public is definitely interested in the (Middle
East) story,'' said David Poltrack, CBS senior vice president for
research, citing preliminary overnight ratings from 24 major cities.
   ``CBS Evening News'' had the biggest increase, up 22 percent in
overnight ratings compared with those for the same three-day period
in the preceding two weeks, he said.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' and ``NBC Nightly News'' were up 16
percent and 8 percent, respectively, he said.
   ``It's conceivable that the three network news ratings will
beat'' those of this week's prime-time programs when the week's
national ratings are averaged out, ``and based on these numbers it
should,'' he said.
   CBS anchorman Dan Rather, who cut short a vacation in France
when Iraq invaded Kuwait, has been among CBS overseas staffers
reporting the story, with Rather working from Jordan.
   NBC's Tom Brokaw and his ABC counterpart, Peter Jennings, have
remained in New York to anchor their evening newscasts, but ABC
``Nightline'' anchorman Ted Koppel flew to Cairo to broadcast from
there Aug. 9.
   Garrick Utley, co-anchorman of NBC's ``Sunday Today,'' went to
Cairo to co-anchor the program from there Aug. 12.

<HEAD>Iraq Jamming Voice of America, BBC Broadcasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voice of America and the BBC increased their
Arabic-language broadcasts after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and
Iraq began jamming both services.
   The broadcasts have been heavy on news about the invasion and
international efforts to punish President Saddam Hussein.
   The U.S. service was trying to bypass the interruption by
beaming its programs to Iraq through satellite television
broadcasts. VOA Deputy Director Robert Coonrod said Iraqis can tune
in if they have a satellite dish or access to one through a local
TV station.
   Satellite transmissions, too, can be jammed. But experts say
Iraq would need to jam the entire Indian Ocean satellite in order
to block VOA.
   The English-language programs of the VOA and BBC have not been
blocked, Coonrod said Aug. 7.
   VOA increased the number of hours it broadcasts in Arabic to the
Middle East from 7{ daily to nearly 10, and replaced music programs
with more news.
   The BBC expanded its Arabic-language broadcasts from nine to 10{
hours.
   ``Jamming the BBC is always the last resort of those who wish to
suppress the truth _ and in a way it is a tribute to the role of
the World Service at times of crisis,'' said David Witherow, deputy
managing director of the BBC World Service.
   ``Jamming is never entirely effective and I am sure that
listeners throughout the region are relying on the BBC for news,''
he said.

<HEAD>Army Refuses Comment on Deployment at Fort</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT BRAGG, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military clampdown on information
about the deployment of troops to the Middle East is the tightest
in years, say reporters staking out this sprawling army post.
   Fort Bragg officials answer press requests and questions in
generic terms, scheduling briefings on the history, climate and
culture of Saudi Arabia and bringing in army chemical weapons
experts.
   But they refuse to comment on any activity regarding deployment
of 82nd Airborne troops to the Middle East, leaving the news media
to sift through rumors.
   Michael Rouse, executive editor of The Fayetteville
Observer-Times, said he respected the military silence.
   He attributed the tense security position to ``irresponsible
acts of the media.''
   ``Some of these people (from outside this area) do something
really stupid like film troops when they're getting ready to move
out when nothing has been announced,'' he said. ``That doesn't add
a damn thing to any of us getting anything.''
   But Tom Lawrence, a reporter for Raleigh television station
WRAL, said the military differentiates between the general public
and reporters.
   ``Civilians with a home camcorder could drive through the base
and shoot anything,'' Lawrence said. ``On the other hand, the news
media can't.
   ``Unless a declaration of war does exist I think the public does
have a right to know what's going on.''

<HEAD>Western Reporters Detained and Beaten</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Western news agency reporters
were detained and beaten by government soldiers who threatened to
shoot them as spies after they crossed through rebel lines Aug. 12.
Among the reporters was Michael Goldsmith, 68, of The Associated
Press.
   The incident happened as government soldiers attacked rebels
trying to take an airport. Reports said at least 18 civilians were
killed in the fighting.
   The reporters were detained by government troops after they had
crossed on foot through rebel lines into government-controlled
territory in the center of Monrovia.
   Besides Goldsmith, those detained were Michael Roddy of Reuters
and Mark Huband, a free-lance writer for United Press International
and The Guardian of London.
   Soldiers seized watches, wallets and other valuables from the
journalists. Some of the items were later returned by senior
officers, but others vanished.
   Soldiers ripped the shirts off the reporters and forced them to
walk shoeless to the presidential mansion. On the way, they were
slapped, punched and threatened with rifle butts.
   Senior officers of President Samuel Doe's army later apologized
for the troops' behavior.
   ``You have to understand they're very nervous,'' said Lt. Col.
Moses Thomas. The journalists later made their way back across
rebel lines without incident.

<HEAD>Organization for Journalism Programs at Black Colleges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-nine historically black colleges and
universities agreed Aug. 10 to form an association of journalism
and mass communication programs.
   Orlando J. Taylor, dean of the School of Communications at
Howard University in Washington, said the group will be called the
Association of Black College Journalism and Mass Communication
Programs.
   The new organization ``represents a historic effort to ensure
that the voices of black colleges and universities will be heard in
journalism and mass communication education and in the media
professions,'' he said.
   The association is designed to help journalism programs gain
accreditation, and increase the hiring of black journalists and
other media professionals.
   ``This association wants to destroy the myth that there are no
qualified black media professionals,'' Taylor said.
   Taylor, chairman of the new group's planning committee, said
large U.S. corporations and major foundations will be asked for
donations.
   Taylor said the organization plans ``an intensive study of the
nature, scope and status of all journalism and mass communication
programs at the nation's 117 historically black colleges, to be
accomplished in the coming year, in order to provide the data base
for enhancing these programs.''
   The new organization was formed during the convention of the
Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.
   Other members of the group's planning committee are Elayne
Hayes-Anthony of Jackson State University, Harry Amana of
Clark-Atlanta University, Dianne Cherry of Hampton University and
Clarice Lowe of Texas Southern University.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Rules Against Houston Chronicle in Transcript Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Houston Chronicle says it will appeal a state
appeals court ruling blocking it from seeing the college
transcripts of local school administrators.
   A three-judge panel of the 1st Court of Appeals held unanimously
Aug. 9 that an amendment to the state Open Records statute exempts
the transcripts from public scrutiny.
   The amendment was enacted at the request of the Houston
Independent School District. That request came after the Chronicle
asked to see the records and after the state attorney general and a
district court had agreed they were public record.
   ``The aspect of this litigation that continues to be distressing
is the extent and the public expense to which the district goes in
order to operate in secret,'' said Chronicle Managing Editor Tony
Pederson.
   HISD Superintendent Joan Raymond declined comment.
   The Chronicle request stemmed from an investigation that showed
that at least 25 high-ranking school officials had obtained
worthless college degrees by mail.

<HEAD>Court Justice Bars Access to TV Videotape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state Supreme Court justice on Aug. 9
stalled an attempt by prosecutors to force a television station to
hand over portions of an interview tape with a crime suspect that
were not broadcast.
   Kevin E. Gendron was sentenced to three years in prison after
pleading no contest to a charge he improperly dumped more than 200
containers of paints and thinners.
   Gendron called WJAR-TV and gave an interview before surrendering
to authorities.
   Superior Court Judge Anthony A. Giannini ruled earlier that the
Rhode Island reporters' shield law did not apply to broadcast
portions of the videotaped interview that were not broadcast. The
judge said WJAR could not claim confidentiality because Gendron had
invited the interview.
   Of more concern to news executives, however, was Giannini's
broader ruling that even if there had been confidentiality
concerns, parts of the shield law that kept such materials from
grand juries were unconstitutional.
   Prosecutors have said the videotape is needed for a grand jury
investigation.
   Justice Donald Shea delayed enforcement of Giannini's order
until the supreme court decides whether to hear the station's
appeal. Shea's order provided no comment on the merits of the case.
   Larry Price, the station's news director, said he was encouraged
by Shea's order ``because it would seem to indicate some interest
in the Supreme Court in hearing the appeal. So we're optimistic
we'll have some opportunity to salvage the shield law.''

<HEAD>Councilors Criticize Newspaper for Vendor Flyers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA FE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two city councilors blasted The New Mexican
newspaper for handing out flyers urging motorists buying papers
from street vendors to support a fight to keep the vendors.
   The city's Public Safety Committee on Aug. 6 adopted a
recommendation by the city attorney to bar vendors from Santa Fe
streets because of liability concerns.
   The New Mexican, the only Santa Fe newspaper that uses vendors,
contends street sales are not a traffic hazard and that a ban would
serve only to put the vendors, many of whom are homeless, out of
work.
   On Aug. 8 vendors distributed flyers headed, ``Help us save our
jobs,'' and listing the home and work telephone numbers of Mayor
Sam Pick, City Manager Suzanne Huebner and the eight city
councilors.
   But Councilor Peso Chavez told a council meeting that night that
it's ``not professional for a reputable newspaper to publish
something without giving the public all the facts.''
   Chavez said it was never the intent to do away with anyone's
job, adding, ``If it's The New Mexican's job to be humanitarian,
they should find these people jobs inside.''
   And Councilor Ouida MacGregor, who said she had been leaning in
favor of the vendors until she saw the flyers, said the newspaper
``knew better (than) to give people the scare that their jobs would
disappear.''
   A secretary in the mayor's office said about 125 calls were
logged by mid-afternoon, most in support of the vendors.
   The flyers also suggested people who could not reach their
councilor attend the council meeting to speak on the issue, but
only one man spoke.
   The council took no action on the issue in the Aug. 8 meeting.

<HEAD>Verdict in Washington Mayor's Trial Prompts Extra Newspaper
Coverage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The outcome of Mayor Marion Barry's drug and
perjury trial was big enough news in the nation's capital that it
prompted one of the city's two daily newspapers to publish its
second-ever extra edition.
   The Aug. 11 Washington Times extra also was the 8-year-old
newspaper's first weekend edition. The Times is usually published
Monday through Friday, while the more widely distributed Washington
Post is printed seven days a week.
   Barry was convicted Aug. 10 of a single cocaine possession
offense after a 10-week trial that featured a videotape showing the
mayor smoking crack cocaine during an FBI sting operation.
   Linda Clark, spokeswoman for the Times, said the extra edition
was sold in downtown Washington and in newsstands and racks on the
street. She said the paper also was being distributed in some
suburban areas.
   The Times published its first extra edition after Barry's arrest.

<HEAD>San Francisco Examiner Editorial Calls for Legalizing Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The San Francisco Examiner, in one of the
first pro-legalization editorials by a big-city newspaper, said
Aug. 12 that the sale and use of drugs should be made legal in the
United States.
   An editorial called the federal war against drugs ``a colossal
waste of effort, money and human resources.''
   ``All anti-drug laws should be repealed,'' it said. ``The war on
drugs should be called off. Just declare victory, play `76
Trombones' and march out. It always gets applause.''
   The newspaper noted that the federal government recently
finished a much-publicized sweep against marijuana plantations in
Humboldt County, about 200 miles north of San Francisco.
   The operation was termed a success by federal officials, the
Examiner noted, although the 1,400 marijuana plants destroyed was
``not enough to put a dent in the supply of marijuana.''
   ``Any way you slice it, there is no denying that this
politician-declared war has been just about effective as the war on
poverty, the war on crime and the war on cancer put together, which
is to say, a complete defeat,'' the editorial said.
   ``The time has come to legalize the sale and use of drugs. Treat
them all like alcohol, which is legal though its sale is subject to
controls.''

<HEAD>State Ordered To Dissolve Board of Inquiry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Aug. 11 directed the state to
dissolve a board of inquiry it convened to investigate a contract
dispute between the Daily News and 10 labor unions.
   U.S. District Judge Kenneth Conboy, in granting the newspaper's
motion for a preliminary injunction, agreed it would be
``irreparably harmed'' if the state fact-finding panel proceeded
with its investigation.
   An inquiry by the board would destroy ``any atmosphere of frank
and open discussions'' and could force the News ``to divulge
confidential or proprietary information,'' the judge wrote.
   The decision also said the newspaper was likely to succeed in
its argument that state labor law, which provides for the
establishment of such a panel, is pre-empted by the National Labor
Relations Act.
   Daily News spokeswoman Virginia Woo said the newspaper does not
comment on ongoing litigation.
   State Labor Commissioner Thomas Hartnett formed the three-member
board in July to look into the labor talks at the News. The panel
has the power to issue subpoenas and take sworn testimony, but
cannot mandate a settlement.
   The News and its unions have een negotiating for six months.
Their contracts expired March 30.

<HEAD>Two Newspapers Pull Doonesbury Strips</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A set of ``Doonesbury'' comics
containing suggestive language and showing a woman wearing nothing
but rope and a bucket is in poor taste, say two newspaper editors
who pulled the strips.
   ``If we had been running it on the op-ed page, we probably would
have thought differently about it,'' said Phil Record, associate
executive editor of the Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram. ``But we
just did not think this was suitable on a page we try to draw kids
to.''
   The newspaper said Aug. 6 it was not publishing ``Doonesbury''
strips that week and notified readers they could pick up copies at
newspaper offices.
   The Republic in Columbus, Ind., also decided to drop the strips.
The newspaper planned to run old ``Doonesbury'' comics instead,
Editor John Harmon said.
   ``It just didn't meet our guidelines for taste,'' he said. ``If
our photographers came back with something like that, we wouldn't
run it.''
   The Baton Rouge (La.) State-Times and Morning Advocate decided
to run the strip opposite the editorial page rather than on the
comics page.
   ``It contains language and art that I would be very reluctant to
invite children to look at,'' said Jim Hughes, executive editor.
``And children read the comics page.''
   The strip by Garry Trudeau apparently referred to the
controversy over National Endowment of the Arts funding. Some
politicians have tried to block government money going to art they
consider obscene, and some artists have lost grants.
   In the Aug. 6 strip, the character J.J. tells her husband she
has a new concept for performance art so innovative that the NEA
will have to reconsider her grant application.
   She is covered only by a strategically placed rope and her hand,
and she has a bucket over her head.
   In strips for later in the week, J.J. utters words such as
``ooze,'' ``lubricate'' and ``hot juices,'' although she makes no
direct reference to sex acts.
   Lee Salem, editorial director at the strip's distributor,
Universal Press Syndicate, said only about eight to 10 newspapers
called with concerns. The Kansas City company distributes the strip
to about 1,000 newspapers.

<HEAD>Radio Station Halts Coverage of Festival</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radio station pulled the
plug on coverage of a festival at an Indian reserve after one of
its reporters said she was told to soften her reports.
   CKNW reporter Laura Ballance said a volunteer at the Stein
Festival on Aug. 4 told her to do a positive story if she wanted to
stay on the site at the Tsawwassen Indian reserve south of
Vancouver.
   ``It's just not acceptable to be told what slant to put on a
story,'' Ballance said.
   News director Warren Barker told listeners on the noon newscast
that the station had canceled further coverage of the festival, a
joint production of Indian bands and environmentalists to help
preserve the Stein Valley north of Vancouver from logging.
   More than 15,000 people turned out Aug. 5 for the festival.
   ``We are not trying to influence coverage,'' said festival
co-ordinator Don McCandless. ``This festival is all about free
speech.''
   Ballance also objected to signing a waiver that urged ``a gentle
approach'' to media coverage.
   McCandless said the waiver merely meant reporters should use
discretion when conducting interviews.
   ``If any media has any difficulty with the waiver we're prepared
to rip it up,'' he added.
   Other media outlets said the waiver was no problem.
   ``They're assisting us rather than hindering us,'' said Margo
Harper, a producer for British Columbia Television.
   The festival, first staged in 1985, mixes native, pop and
country performers with speeches and panels on environmental and
native issues.

   A reporter for the
Vancouver Province newspaper, forced to testify in a drug trial,
acknowledged he secretly taped a meeting he had with a defense

recording of the meeting as an exhibit.
   Young is one of several lawyers defending seven people charged

<HEAD>Concern Over Attacks on Press in Turkey and Namibia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Press Institute said Aug. 8 it
was ``extremely concerned'' at the arrest of a newspaper editor in
Turkey and the firebombing of a newspaper's offices in Namibia.
   The institute sent a message to Turkish President Turgut Ozal
calling for the ``immediate and unconditional release'' of Dogu
Perincek, editor of the newspaper Yozol.
   Perincek was arrested Aug. 6 in Diyarbakir, eastern Turkey,
``apparently because he had spoken out against current government
repression in the southeastern region of Turkey,'' the message said.
   The institute said it was ``distressed'' to learn of a fire bomb
attack last week on The Namibian newspaper in Windhoek.
   ``We understand that white right-wing extremists are thought to
be behind the bombing,'' the institute said in a message to Prime
Minister Hage Geingob.
   It hoped those responsible would be brought to justice quickly
and the newspaper compensated and given protection.
   The institute has offices in London and Zurich and is an
independent organization of publishers and editors in some 60
countries.

   A major union at NBC said it probably will go to
court to fight the network's ``final'' offer that the company plans
to put into effect Aug. 15.
   The decision by the National Association of Broadcast Employees
and Technicians was made Aug. 9 after NBC rejected the union's bid
to resume negotiations with a federal mediator present, a union
spokesman said.
   ``NBC's position is that we've had a number of meetings over
seven months and there has been ample opportunity to discuss key
issues,'' said Betty Hudson, an NBC spokeswoman. ``The contract is
on the table and we have no intention of modifying it.''
   There will be no salary increases when NBC puts the contract
into effect because union members haven't ratified it, she said.
``They'll operate under the old wage provisions until we have a
ratified contract.''
   NBC's previous contract with NABET expired March 31. Union
members have twice rejected NBC contract offers.
   When NBC implements its new four-year contract, ``it appears
that we'll be countering with every legal means at our disposal,''
said the union's spokesman, John Krieger.
   This means a court challenge of NBC's action, said Krieger,
whose union says it has 2,373 members at NBC, 1,300 of them
engineers.
   Major issues in the dispute include jurisdiction, daily hires
and NBC's proposals to let outside producers rent its facilities to
make new programs without union members employed by NBC.
   No walkout is imminent. The union's members, who struck NBC for
17 weeks in 1987, have not taken a strike vote, Krieger said.
   NABET members work at NBC and NBC-owned facilities here and in
Burbank, Calif., Washington, Cleveland and Chicago.

   Merchant banking funds headed by Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc. have agreed to buy a significant minority interest in
Infinity Broadcasting Corp., which owns 17 radio stations.
   The privately owned company announced Aug. 6 that the Merchant
Banking Partnerships of Lehman Brothers agreed to buy $26.7 million
in newly-issued stock and warrants from Infinity Broadcasting.
   In addition, the funds agreed to pay an undisclosed sum for
additional stock from the founders of Infinity Broadcasting,
Michael Weiner and Gerald Carrus.
   After the deal is completed, the partnership will own just under
50 percent of the company's stock, according to Infinity spokesman
Farid Suleman.
   The biggest individual shareholder will be Mel Karmazin,
Infinity's president and chief executive, who holds just under 20
percent.
   Weiner and Carrus, who will stay on as co-chairmen of the
company, each will own under 10 percent of the company, Suleman
said.
   Warrants held by bondholders and employee stock options account
for most of the remainder of the company's stock.
   Suleman said Infinity had $107.8 million in revenue last year.
   Infinity owns and operates the following radio stations: WXRK-FM
and WZRC-AM in New York; KROQ-FM, Los Angeles; WJMK-FM and WJJD-AM,

   Attorneys for former WBZZ-FM news director Liz Randolph asked
Judge John L. Musmanno to uphold the verdict against EZ
Communications, which owns WBZZ-FM, and against DJs Jim Quinn and
Donald ``Banana Don'' Jefferson.
   Earlier this year the jury said Ms. Randolph was entitled to
compensation and punitive damages for intentional infliction of
emotional distress, invasion of privacy and defamation.
   The case was based on comments and skits, which Ms. Randolph
said implied she was sexually promiscuous, had sexually transmitted
diseases and was seeing a psychiatrist.
   Attorneys for the defendants want the judge to overturn the
verdict or to grant a new trial outside of southwestern
Pennsylvania.
   The defendants maintain the remarks were jokes. Their lawyers
argued Aug. 6 that the announcers can't afford to pay the $292,000
the jury ruled they should give Ms. Randolph, who now works for
KDKA radio in Pittsburgh.

Campisi, who had been in the military since he was 18, was assigned

   A 40-year-old flight attendant shouldn't be

Howard Metzenbaum, who's asking American Airlines to change its
weight policy.
   The policy is ``outdated and wrong,'' Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said
in a letter urging the Texas-based airline to scrap its weight
standard. The senator said the standard appears to be biased
against women, particularly older women.
   ``According to American's flight attendants, the standard is
applied in practice almost exclusively to the female attendants.
Certainly it has no application whatsoever to the pilots,
management or executive staff,'' Metzenbaum wrote.
   American Airlines President Robert Crandall has said weight
standards are necessary because ``we've got some people on our
airplanes that are way too heavy.''

   ``The spacecraft is healthy except for this little problem, and
we can work around it,'' he added. ``Every indication is this will

   Launched from the shuttle Atlantis in May 1989, Magellan is on a
mission to use radar to penetrate Venus' thick clouds and make the

   Today is Monday, August 20th, the 232nd day of 1990. There are
133 days left in the year.
   
   Fifty years ago, on Aug. 20, 1940, British Prime Minister
Winston Churchill paid tribute to the Royal Air Force, saying,
``Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many
to so few.''
   On this date:
   In 1833, Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd president of the United
States, was born in North Bend, Ohio.
   In 1866, President Andrew Johnson formally declared the Civil
War over, even though fighting had stopped months earlier.
   In 1914, German forces occupied Brussels, Belgium, during World
War I.
   In 1918, Britain opened its offensive on the Western front
during World War One.
   In 1920, America's first commercial radio station, 8MK in
Detroit (later WWJ), began daily broadcasting.
   In 1948, the United States ordered the expulsion of Jacob
Lomakin, the Soviet Consul General in New York, accusing him of
attempting to force the return of two consular employees to the
Soviet Union against their will.
   In 1953, the Soviet Union publicly acknowledged it had conducted
a test detonation of a hydrogen bomb.
   In 1955, hundreds of people were killed in anti-French rioting
in Morocco and Algeria.
   In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed a nearly $1 billion
anti-poverty measure.
   In 1968, the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact nations began
invading Czechoslovakia to crush the ``Prague Spring''
liberalization drive of Alexander Dubcek's regime.
   In 1977, the U.S. launched Voyager 2, an unmanned spacecraft
carrying a 12-inch copper phonograph record containing greetings in
dozens of languages, samples of music and sounds of nature.
   In 1979, swimmer Diana Nyad succeeded in her third attempt at
swimming from the Bahamas to Florida, arriving at Juno Beach 27
hours and 38 minutes after leaving North Bimini.
   In 1986, mail carrier Patrick Henry Sherrill went on a deadly
rampage at a post office in Edmond, Okla., shooting 14 fellow
workers to death before killing himself.
   Ten years ago: The U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 _ with the
   United States abstaining _ to censure Israel for declaring that all
of Jerusalem was its capital.
   Five years ago: The Reverend Jerry Falwell, returning to the
U.S. from a five-day tour of South Africa, called Anglican Bishop
Desmond Tutu a ``phony'' for presuming to speak on behalf of South
African blacks.
   One year ago: British conservationist George Adamson, 83, was
shot and killed by bandits near his camp in Kenya.
   Today's Birthdays: Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
   D-Maine, is 57. Singer-musician Isaac Hayes is 48. The former prime
minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi, is 46. CBS newscaster Connie Chung
is 44.

days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On Aug. 23, 1927, Italian-born anarchists Nicola Sacco and
Bartolomeo Vanzetti were executed in Boston for the murders of two
men during a 1920 payroll robbery in a case that had drawn
widespread controversy.
   (In 1977, Sacco and Vanzetti were vindicated by Massachusetts
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who declared that ``any stigma and
disgrace should be forever removed'' from their names.)

term.
   In 1979, Soviet dancer Alexander Godunov defected while the
Bolshoi Ballet was on tour in New York.
   Ten years ago: In a reversal, the Communist government of Poland
   agreed to negotiate directly with representatives of striking
workers.
   Five years ago: The Reverend Jerry Falwell said his statement
calling South African Bishop Desmond Tutu a ``phony'' was a poor
choice of words. But Falwell said he still believed Tutu did not
speak for the majority of black South Africans.
   One year ago: In a case that inflamed racial tensions in New
York, Yusuf Hawkins, a 16-year-old black youth, was shot to death
after he and his friends were confronted by a gang of white youths
in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn.

<HEAD>TV's `Women and Men' Puts Short Stories on the Screen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SHEPPERTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a soundstage west of London, actor
Beau Bridges was ordered to ``keep the menace on.''
   ``Otherwise, the scene sags,'' director Frederic Raphael told
the 48-year-old actor, who was sizing up a potentially available
Elizabeth McGovern on a train heading westward across the United
States.
   It was the 12th take of a scene that depends largely on innuendo
and the unspoken, and Raphael and his actors are determined to get
it right. Minutes later, a satisfied beam spreads across the face
of the lanky Chicago-born Briton. Listening to the tape playback,
he has decided that all is well.
   The results can be seen Aug. 19 on Home Box Office. ``Women and
Men,'' a 90-minute film, consists of three dramatized short stories
_ Dorothy Parker's ``Dusk Before Fireworks,'' Ernest Hemingway's
``Hills Like White Elephants,'' and Mary McCarthy's ``The Man in
the Brooks Brothers Suit.''
   ``With (producer) David Brown and 75 executives from HBO, it's
the biggest production since `Intolerance,''' D.W. Griffith's epic
1916 silent film, joked Raphael, 59.
   He was speaking at the end of a January day's filming on ``The
Man In the Brooks Brothers Suit,'' which he adapted and directed.
It is his first TV work since ``After the War,'' the acclaimed
British mini-series based on his novel and aired in the United
States at the beginning of the year.
   David Brown asked Raphael to adapt the short story, written in
1941 for Partisan Review magazine.
   ``Writing TV for HBO for someone else to direct is not exactly
my idea of heaven,'' said Raphael, who was eager to take on both
tasks.
   ``I mean, there's always some reason why I spend my life
teaching what I'm afraid I now think of as `kids' what I meant and
why I meant it and why their view of it is wrong,'' he said. ``So
when it was put to me to do this, I couldn't really refuse.''
   All three ``Women and Men'' segments have attracted top-drawer
talent. ``Hills Like White Elephants,'' filmed last December in
Spain, pairs Oscar nominees Melanie Griffith (``Working Girl'') and
James Woods (``Salvador'') under the direction of Tony Richardson,
who won the 1963 Academy Award for ``Tom Jones.''
   ``Dusk Before Fireworks,'' directed by Ken Russell, teams Peter
Weller as the slick-haired gigolo Hobie and Molly Ringwald as his
satin doll, Kit.
   ``I'm almost schizophrenic in it,'' Ringwald said during a break
in shooting. She was decked out in silk and satin and beads to play
a would-be sophisticate.
   ``One scene I'm calm and charming, the next I'm angry. I hope
people will like (Kit) enough or understand her enough to forgive
her her mood changes,'' she said.
   Brown said the three stories were linked ``only in a random
way.''
   ``They're all about the male-female relationship _ the battle of
the sexes, if you will,'' said Brown, whose credits include the hit
films ``Jaws'' and ``The Sting'' as well as the current Broadway
plays, ``A Few Good Men'' and ``Tru.''
   ``Women and Men'' has been budgeted at ``just under'' $3
million, Brown said. He is interested in having Nora Ephron and
Woody Allen, among others, adapt stories for future telefilms.
   ``The idea was that most of us in show business don't always get
to do the things that interest us that much,'' he said. ``I'd like
to do films I would personally see.''
   Anthology films inevitably invite comparisons among the
participants, Brown said, though ``we don't wish them to be in
competition.''
   Frederic Raphael said of such comparisons: ``It matters to me
because in life nearly everything matters, unfortunately.''
   ``But if Tony and Ken turn out to be better directors than me,
my mother and I are the only people who are going to break our
hearts about it,'' he said. ``My wife most certainly is not.''

   The race between U.S. Rep. Denny Smith and
Democratic challenger Mike Kopetski has turned into a name-calling
grudge match focusing on some of this year's hottest campaign
issues: taxes, abortion and the savings and loan mess.
   Smith, running for a sixth term, calls Kopetski a tax-happy
``extreme liberal'' who's been using dirty tricks to win a seat in
Congress.
   Kopetski says Smith is the one who's been waging a dirty
campaign in an effort to hide his own ``unethical'' conduct in
office.
   Smith was shocked two years ago when Kopetski came within 707
votes of ousting him from the 5th District seat. This year, Smith
is under even greater pressure. The staunchly anti-abortion
congressman has been targeted for defeat by national pro-choice
groups and he's been linked to the national savings-and-loan
scandal.
   Combined, those factors make Smith one of the most vulnerable
House incumbents. And that may explain why the campaigns have
turned so nasty.
   Smith agrees that discussions have gone beyond the issues.
   ``We have sensed that Kopetski's campaign staff hates us,'' the
Republican congressman said. ``I do sense his animosity, and the
animosity of his campaign.''
   Kopetski, who served in the Oregon House from 1985 to 1987, said
he harbors no ill will against Smith personally, but is irritated
by the ``very negative, very dirty'' campaign Smith is waging
against him.
   ``He really set the tone early on,'' Kopetski said. ``He's
broken new ground on negative campaigning.''
   The war of words is likely to escalate after Labor Day, when
Kopetski plans to begin hitting hard on what could be his
campaign's most potent issue: Smith's involvement in the nation's
savings and loan mess.
   Abortion also looms large as an issue and not just because
national groups are interested in the race. Oregon voters,
generally considered pro-choice, will be asked to decide on two
ballot issues that would restrict access to abortions.
   The populous 5th District stretches from south of Portland
through the Willamette Valley and includes the state capital of
Salem. There is no heavy industry and many people in the district
work in agriculture, academics and state government.
   But it's hard to tell how voters are reacting because there
haven't been any significant independent polls on the race.
   In a series of newspaper and radio advertisements, Smith painted
Kopetski as a tax-and-spend political liberal who's soft on crime
and who wants to lock away more old growth forests at the expense
of timber worker jobs.
   Kopetski cried foul, saying that the ads contained distortions
and lies.
   Smith, however, said he intends to keep running advertisements
that highlight Kopetski's record as a two-term state representative.
   ``What is dirty about saying Mike voted 39 out of 42 times to
raise your taxes while he was in the Legislature?'' Smith said.
``He needs to be smoked out on these issues.
   ``The more people see of Mike Kopetski and the more they ask of
his record the better chance I have to get more votes,'' he said.
   The Kopetski campaign has countered with the charge that Smith
has been improperly using a congressional staff employee and an
office fax machine for his political campaign.
   Smith denied any wrongdoing and has challenged Kopetski to ``put
up or shut up'' by filing a complaint with the House Ethics
Committee.
   A more serious attack on Smith's integrity could spring from
disclosures last December that he lobbied for protection of
directors of troubled savings and loan institutions while he was
one such director.
   The issue is a sensitive one for Smith because taxpayers are
being asked to foot the bill for $500-billion bailout, which
results from wholesale failures in the savings and loan industry.
   Kopetski hasn't said much publicly about the savings and loan
issue, but he said that will change once the fall campaign season
is in full swing.
   ``Starting after Labor Day, of course we're going to be talking
about his involvement in savings and loan,'' the Keizer Democrat
said.
   Kopetski said his campaign would work to get the message across
to 5th District residents ``that their member of Congress used his
office for private, personal gain. He had his own interests at
heart.''
   ``There's a serious question of whether he violated the ethical
standards of Congress,'' he said.
   Smith said he only went to bat for savings and loan directors
who were being hounded by federal regulators and that he's ready to
defend his conduct to district voters.
   ``I'm not ashamed of anything I've done,'' he said. ``I didn't
take any jet airplane rides, didn't stay in anybody's condominium.
   ``I didn't do anything wrong and I have nothing to apologize to
my constituents for except that I didn't make more noise and get
these regulators removed.''
   Smith said he's also prepared to defend his long-held stand
against abortion, which he doesn't consider a major campaign issue.
   ``I don't sense that that's the most important issue to
people,'' he said.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Although still a little cloud on the horizon,
the formation of white student unions is causing concern on already
fragmented U.S. college campuses. Are they the wave of the future,
a reaction to affirmative action programs or are they just a
passing fad?

   Another hot night is closing in on Mark
Wright. Outside his apartment at a complex for married students at
the University of Florida, black parents are coaxing their children
indoors from the swimming pool. He can hear neighbors bid goodnight
in Spanish.
   Mark Wright lives here, but he is not one of them.
   ``I guess we're the last group to say we're a victi,'' said
Wright, a 23-year-old engineering student who is inching his way
out of the working class. Apart from the worry that pinches his
face and a stomach ache that could be the start of an ulcer, Wright
looks like he has nothing to complain about. But he does.
   His problem, he says, is that he is white.
   That's why he formed a White Student Union.
   ``Americans are notorious for their short-sightedness. When we
(whites) become minorities, the belief systems will be entrenched
for discriminating against whites,'' said Wright, fingering a white
and blue bumper sticker from the U.S. Senate campaign of David
Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader turned Louisiana legislator.
   ``A lot of whites like me don't make it here,'' he said. ``We're
fighting for white civil rights.''
   A small but persistent and growing movement, white student
unions are another sliver in the fragmenting of campus life in the
United States.
   The backdrop to the movement is a contemporary college campus no
longer dominated by white men. It reflects the nation's racial and
ethnic mix. In California, for instance, it's easy to find
four-year colleges where Caucasian describes just half the student
body, if that _ the University of California at Los Angeles, the
University of California at Berkeley and California State
Polytechnic University at Pomona, to name a few.
   One result is an array of student unions and associations formed
along racial and ethnic lines. African-Americans, Native Americans,
Hispanics, Asian-Americans, Filipinos, Pacific Asians and the like
find strength by banding together. Besides the social benefits of
such unions, students who align themselves this way find a new
identity, asking for more teachers and a curriculum that teaches
them about their particular heritage.
   It's the first time for many to stop feeling like an invisible
minority and start gaining pride in an identity.
   These groups follow on an older tradition of students forming
alliances along religious lines, such as Newman centers for Roman
Catholics and Hillel clubs for Jews.
   The current fragmenting alarms educators. But there is good news
on campus, too. Many college students of all colors and backgrounds
are finding common ground in a new enthusiasm for volunteer
projects. Students are finding that in helping others, they are
helping each other scale high social walls.
   Though white student unions so far have raised more derision
than members, the groups are staking a claim in the collegiate
mainstream. At least two unions, at the University of Florida and
at Temple University in Philadelphia, are officially registered as
student activities, though the latter seems to have disappeared
from that campus.
   White unions are also forming at Suffolk University in Boston,
the University of Southwestern Louisiana, Tulane University and the
University of New Orleans. The would-be founder at the latter is
Howie Farrell Jr., the son of David Duke's campaign manager.
   Their stated purpose is opposing affirmative action policies as
unfair and unnecessary and saving what they call ``white culture.''
   Whites are the new losers, they say.
   Critics call them racist. Others find their claims of anti-white
oppression ludicrous.
   But if they are chastised as bigots and laughed at for saying
whites need defending, white student unions should not be dismissed
as some silly fringe, observers and educators say, since they
express a resentment of quotas, financial aid and scholarships they
claim favor blacks and other minorities.
   ``White student unions are indicative of a larger problem,''
said Leonard Zeskind, research director for the Center for
Democratic Renewal, which tracks and responds to hate groups.
   ``The real cause for concern is that certain elements of the
next generation of young whites will not have a commitment to
racial justice and political pluralism and democratic values,'' he
said.
   It is worrisome, Zeskind added, that the founders of white
student unions are those who will be in the professional ranks.
   Take Stephen Heaslip, a 20-year-old junior at Suffolk University
who is considering a law career. He is organizing a white student
union at the private Boston school and hopes to have an adviser
next year.
   ``I got the idea from reading our school newspaper, which had a
lot of racially based articles,'' Heaslip said. ``Black this, black
that. I'd see in the paper, you'd have to be a minority to get
(certain) scholarships. That brought about feelings I was being
discriminated against because I'm white.
   ``There's been discrimination against blacks and Jews and
Irish,'' Heaslip said. ``But this is government-mandated racism.''
   As a wider assortment of people go to college, tensions and even
open hostility threaten a happy picture of democracy in action.
   This mutual aid and comfort has another side to it, said
Reginald Wilson, senior scholar at the American Council on
Education and expert on minorities in higher education. ``It serves
a purpose of raising pride, and then it can reach a xenophobic
point,'' he said. ``Not a pride in who you are, but rejecting who
you ain't.''
   He pointed out that the present course of equal opportunity was
set in a time of economic optimism that is no more.
   ``In the '60s the economy was expanding and colleges were
opening up and more spaces were created in universities. Nearly 800
campuses were built in a 20-year span. Higher education was
bursting all over the place,'' Wilson said.
   New laws demanded an end to bias in admissions and in the hiring
of minorities when they graduated.
   Today, higher education costs more. No one is building colleges
and competition for existing places in college and afterward is
fierce.
   ``We could be heading back into an era where there would be very
serious conflict on campus,'' Wilson said.
   That conflict has sometimes evolved into violence.
   A black fraternity is burned to the ground at the University of
Mississippi; the Native American community council president at
Macalester College in Minnesota receives hate mail; the University
of Michigan at Ann Arbor is the scene of protests and violence
between Arabs and Jews over the issues of Zionism, anti-Semitism
and Palestinian rights; a laundry ticket is tacked to the bulletin
board used by a club for Asian Pacific law students at New York
University; blacks are mocked and assaulted at any number of
campuses.
   Even at its most benign, today's campus is a place of cliques
and special interest groups.
   Noting this trend, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement
of Teaching issued a special report this year about the growing
fragmentation on campuses along racial and ethnic lines.
   ``Communication is frequently breaking down and prejudices are
reinforced,'' said foundation President Ernest Boyer from his
office in Princeton, N.J. ``This is an ominous trend in the society
at large. If the university can't define itself higher, you don't
have much hope for the city streets,'' he said.

   Some of the white student unions still being formed are simply
trying to find a faculty adviser. Others are awaiting official
recognition come fall or to gain enough members to make their
entrance felt.
   So far they are attracting few active members _ Wright's has
about 10 since its founding last December. A pattern for the unions
and white supremacist efforts is that they are either squelched or
forced underground by opponents.
   The unions, which are connected by an informal network, keep
their distance from white supremacists, at least publicly. Open
association with hate groups could cost them the credibility they
covet.
   Yet the Ku Klux Klan has shown interest and already has caused
trouble for the Florida group. When a former Klan leader asked
Wright for a copy of the union's constitution, he got it. But the
union's faculty adviser promptly resigned. The union must find a
replacement to maintain official status.
   A respected state institution, the University of Florida was
once a preserve of the state's white establishment. Now there are
unwelcome sentiments and tensions on the campus where, under shade
trees dripping with Spanish moss, the 34,000 students, 7,000
minority members among them, usually mingle with a polite civility.
   The White Student Union's first meeting in January attracted 60
protesters, white and black, who wrangled with Wright and his
supporters in emotional debate. The second meeting ended early when
a similar scene occurred.
   The next month, the moribund Campus Coalition Against Bigotry
regrouped and staged an anti-racist protest.
   Black students react with puzzlement and dismay that the bad old
days may be coming back.
   ``To me, it was kind of funny,'' said Brian Coe, a 21-year-old
senior planning to teach special education. But he was disappointed
it gained official status. ``I thought, if they can let something
like that form, what's next?''
   Up north, the City of Brotherly Love didn't do it for Michael
Spletzer.
   While studying architecture at Temple University a few years
ago, he assessed his opportunities as a white man and decided he
was losing his edge and needed a platform to defend his rights.
   So in 1988 he prevailed on the university to allow him to
register the country's first White Student Union.
   Spletzer, who graduated this spring, keeps in touch with Kristl
Wiernicki. Dean of students at Temple, Wiernicki decided that once
the White Student Union met school requirements, getting an adviser
and drafting a suitable constitution, she was obliged to let it
register at Temple, which has 34,000 students. Nearly 25 percent
are racial minorities.
   Wiernicki said that after the White Student Union's initial
stormy recruitment effort, when students of all colors tangled with
the union in loud public debate, it vanished from campus.
   She regards the White Student Union as a passing trend, but says
it was also important not to ignore what Spletzer and his
apparently few comrades were after. What Spletzer was saying was,
``We don't want you to lose sight of us,'' Wiernicki adds.
   A recent visit to the Temple campus seemed to confirm
Wiernicki's assessment.
   Freshmen had scarcely heard of the union. Older students said it
hasn't been heard from in a long time.
   On the urban campus, where every identifiable group seems to
have its own unofficial corner in the Student Activities Center,
most people see the white union as part of the mosaic.
   Others called them troublemakers. ``They're racist pigs,'' said
Josephine Chiappetta, 20, a business major who is white. ``I feel
the same way about the black students union.''
   Those who gravitated to Temple's white union, said junior
Michael Tilghman, are just disturbed that blacks get so much
financial help and other assistance. ``By starting a White Student
Union, that's a way to express their anger,'' he said.
   On one point Tilghman, who is black, agrees with them, however.
``Affirmative action is an insult to me. Give me the same as a
white person.''

   When Tara Green and Barbara Merz make
sandwiches for their local soup kitchen, they think they're only
feeding the hungry.
   But the two 19-year-old Temple University students are also
binding the racial and cultural fragments troubling today's college
campuses.
   Tara Green is black; Barbara Merz is white. Volunteer projects
like theirs at the Alpha Sigma Alpha sorority are a new kind of
necessary glue, educators and activists say.
   With the help of civil rights law and university policies
seeking more diversity, higher education is now pursued by those
formerly kept out. Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans, as
well as the disabled and older students are taking their places in
the classroom.
   Once there, they also organize.
   Like tiny nations, groups identified by race and heritage pursue
their own interests, leading to campus fragmentation. But another
kind of activism is gaining cachet on campus: extracurricular
community service. This may be the way to reconnect the pieces of
the shattered mosaic, some organizations say.
   ``What we see are signs of community activity on campuses, both
among majority students and students of color,'' said Susan Stroud,
director of Campus Compact and the Center for Public Service.
   Housed at Brown University in Rhode Island, Campus Compact is a
national endeavor founded five years ago to promote volunteer
activities as part of the college experience.
   Stroud adds, ``There are some campuses that are making community
service one of those ways that one bridges the differences at
campuses.''
   ``Mixing it up'' is the philosophy adopted by the Campus
Outreach Community League in St. Paul, Minn. Run mostly by recent
college graduates and affiliated with 600 campuses, the
organization fosters the idea that altruism isn't enough. When
students arrange to build housing for the poor or tutor inner-city
children, they must be sure to draw participants from assorted
races and ethnic backgrounds.
   Says the league's executive director, Julia Scatliff:
   ``For organizations to remain predominantly white in an age that
is predominantly diverse, it's not effective anymore.
   ``Higher education needs to be shook up, because there are
really pockets of isolation on campus and what we're trying to do
is offer pragmatic solutions,'' Scatliff said in a recent interview.
   It's this notion of bringing people together that inspired Diana
Lugo to form ``culture clusters'' last year at California State
Polytechnic University in Pomona.
   Students from various ethnic and racial backgrounds who did
volunteer work met weekly during Lugo's senior year to talk about
their respective cultures. ``That's the only way we're going to
learn about each other,'' said Lugo, a Mexican-American who now
works at the California spinoff of Campus Compact.
   In Louisiana, where a fledgling white student union movement
stirs fears of old racism in a new disguise and schools are still
identified by color, 150 white and black students from eight New
Orleans campuses joined forces one day in April to spruce up a
mission for the homeless.
   That event was the work of Debra Thomas, New Orleans coordinator
of the league and a recent graduate of Southern University at New
Orleans.
   Like many in this new effort to integrate volunteer activities,
she said it's too soon to know the long-term results.
   ``But one of the things that have happened, it has provided a
forum in which students have a chance to change some of their old
perceptions. And that's a start.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The once barren wastes of northern Quebec,
untamed and pristine, have been transformed by the construction of
the largest hydroelectric project on earth. The government of
Quebec Province says only good will result; the natives think
otherwise and are prepared to try to hold back further building.

   The $62 billion James Bay project is the
largest hydroelectric development on the planet, cutting roads,
building dams, diverting rivers and changing the face of the earth
in an area as big as France.
   For officials of the Hydro Quebec power company, owned by the
government of the Province of Quebec, taming the wild rivers of
this frigid and practically unpopulated sub-Arctic region is the
cleanest, most economic and socially acceptable way of meeting the
province's growing energy needs into the next century.
   For the 10,000 Cree Indians whose ancestors lived in the
northern Quebec forest here for centuries and who make up one of
the earth's last remaining hunter-trapper societies, the
15-year-old project is disrupting nature, poisoning the fish,
ruining traplines and threatening their traditional way of life.
   And for many environmentalists, the development of the James Bay
region is not only destructive to the fauna and flora, it has been
ill-studied, never subject to public review and may not even be
needed.
   ``If they don't let us develop hydroelectric power, that means
nuclear power at a much higher price, both in money and in
insecurity,'' rejoins Andre Mercier, an engineer and Hydro Quebec's
vice president for system planning in Montreal.
   ``To us, this land is sacred,'' said Matthew Coon-Come, grand
chief of the Crees of Quebec. ``It's the only thing we have left.
It is still our main economic base, hunting and fishing. We are
concerned about the kind of land and environment we leave behind
for our children.''
   Radisson is the end of the road north. After Radisson, you go by
air, by water or you walk. From here to the northern tip of Quebec
Province is 650 miles of trackless taiga and tundra. Until now it
has been the domain of the Cree, a few Inuit Indians and the
occasional hardy white hunter or fisherman.
   Seen from Radisson, a company town of about 2,500 inhabitants
650 miles north of Montreal, the James Bay project is an awesome
engineering accomplishment. In just one phase of construction that
began on one river, La Grande, the company has built nine dams and
206 dikes using 150 million hours of work by 55,000 people. It has
excavated 262 million cubic meters of rock and soil and poured
550,000 tons of concrete into pristine northern rivers. And it
spent $13.8 billion.
   One example of the Herculean nature of the scheme: the
Caniapiscau River, which used to run north and empty into Ungava
Bay, now runs west into the La Grande system and empties most of
its water into James Bay.
   The LG2 dam just east of here, on what 10 years ago was a lonely
river in a vast, silent forest of black spruce, is as high as a
53-story building and is 1} miles long. It required 23 million
cubic meters of fill. That, as Hydro Quebec's on-site public
relations officer Serge Marcoux likes to say, ``is 10 times the
volume of the Cheops Pyramid,'' for all those whose mind's eye
carries a portable pyramid.
   When all 16 LG2 turbine units are operating at the same time,
Marcoux says it requires the equivalent of five Olympic swimming
pools full of water each second, for those who think in terms of
Olympic swimming pools. The reservoir contains enough water to
supply the needs of Montreal for a century.
   And that's not counting LG3 and LG4, or LG1 now under
construction downstream, or the new power plant here called LG2A,
or the Laforge 1 and Laforge 2 plants to come on line in 1993 and
1994. It's mind-boggling.
   Phase 1 of La Grande has added 10,282 megawatts of power to
Hydro Quebec's capacity. A megawatt is 1 million watts. Phase 2 is
adding 4,652 megawatts more. Next on Hydro Quebec's horizon is
development of the Great Whale River, 125 miles north, for another
3,500 megawatts, followed by the Nottaway, Broadback and Rupert
Rivers, known as NBR, 8,000 megawatts.
   The Crees are determined to stop Great Whale and NBR development
and have filed actions in both federal and provincial courts.
   ``Right now, we are economically self-sufficient,'' says
Coon-Come. ``But they are going to destroy it. Then the taxpayers
are going to say, `Those lazy Indians, now we have to pay for their
housing, their health services, their alcohol abuse programs.' They
are going to find their taxes going to these `lazy, drunken
Indians.' That's because they destroyed our economic base.''
   Mercier estimated the hydroelectric potential of the James Bay
rivers at 50,000 megawatts, some of them more cost efficient than
others.
   ``There is no other province or state in North America that is
in such a privileged situation,'' he said. ``It is a resource that
is there to use.''
   In that, Mercier is echoing his boss, Quebec Premier Robert
Bourassa, whose policy is to make hydroelectric development of the
province's vast northland the foundation of the entire economic
development of Quebec, whose leaders in the past have raised the
possibility of secession.
   ``Quebec is a vast hydroelectric plant in the bud, and every day
millions of potential kilowatt hours flow downhill and out to sea.
What a waste,'' Bourassa said in his 1985 book ``Power from the
North.''
   Hydro Quebec revenues represent 5 percent of the province's
gross national product with $5.2 billion in sales to Quebec and
$308 million to the rest of Canada and the United States. It is a
company with $34 billion in assets, but also $22 billion in
long-term debt.
   The sale of electricity to the United States particularly riles
opponents. Many feel Quebec is being raped to run the
air-conditioners of New York.
   Hydro sees foreign sales as subsidizing construction now for
meeting future Canadian needs.
   Seen from Chisasibi, a Cree village of 2,500 about 80 miles to
the west on the shore of James Bay, the development is equally
awesome. It brought the 20th century crashing down on a simple
people.
   Before the project, there was no road to Chisasibi. Nobody had
cars or trucks; there was no television and little store-bought
food. Supplies came in summer by barge from northern Ontario.
   Hydro Quebec built the road and the modern world drove right
down it to the James Bay, bringing better education and health
care. But it also brought the dark side of modern life _
alcoholism, drug abuse and juvenile delinquency.

   ``Health has changed,'' said Fernand Filion, an anthropologist
now heading social services in Chisasibi. ``Infant mortality has
been reduced. The Crees live longer. But now they have high blood
pressure, obesity and alcoholism.''
   Adds Charlie Pepabano, executive assistant to Chisasibi Chief
Violet Pachanos: ``The progress was too much. It came too fast and
didn't give us a chance to adapt. We are trying to educate people
that it's here and that we are going to have to live with it.''
   Another blow has been to the country and its wildlife. The land
is fragile. In these northern climes, it takes a tree 100 years to
grow to the size of a man's thigh. Forest fires ruin areas for
generations, disrupting wildlife, even affecting the quality of the
fish, according to Crees.
   Hydro Quebec says the impact on the environment has been
minimal. The company points to the hundreds of environmental
studies and follow-ups carried out by more than 200 scientists and
claims there are no fewer resources, no fewer animals, no fewer
fish in the region than before the project began. In some cases, as
with caribou, numbers are even on the increase.
   Cree hunters and trappers say otherwise. All the best fishing
lakes are flooded, along with many beaver lodges, according to
Chisasibi trapper George Lameboy. Those beaver are gone, he said.
``Now you never see signs of muskrat in the LG2 area,'' he said.
   ``Their studies are geared to insure that they are in conformity
with their plans,'' says Coon-Come. ``There were no totally
independent studies carried out.''
   One of the major critics of the project is the New York-based
National Audubon Society, which says the development is a major
threat to numerous species of shore birds and waterfowl. The
eastern shore of the James Bay is a major staging area for
migratory birds.
   Hydro Quebec, responding to electricity needs, increases the
discharge of water into the James Bay in winter and decreases it in
spring and summer, reversing Mother Nature.
   The only major impact the company will admit to is a serious
rise in the mercury levels in fish from newly flooded reservoirs.
As a result, the Crees no longer can eat certain types of fish from
certain lakes and rivers.
   The mercury occurs naturally in vegetation. When reservoirs are
flooded, bacteria feed on the decomposing organic matter,
transforming the harmless mercury into poisonous methyl mercury.
This in turn gets into the food system by contaminating predator
fish such as pickerel, lake trout and whitefish.
   Hydro Quebec says the lakes and rivers eventually will return to
normal but the estimated time it will take varies from 10 to 30
years.
   Others say all of Hydro Quebec's studies are self-serving.
   Alan Penn, an ecologist who advises the Grand Council of the
Crees of Quebec, said: ``It is information generated by an
organization for its own purposes and not to understand the
functioning of an ecosystem.''
   Penn's biggest criticism is that there is no outside control or
direction of Hydro Quebec's studies and that they are producing
largely useless data.
   The Crees claim they only found out about James Bay development
when it was well under way, after Hydro Quebec began building roads
and other infrastructure. The Indians went to court and won an
injunction, but Hydro got a stay and work went ahead while the
matter languished in court.
   The natives saw it was too late, work had progressed too far,
and decided to make the best deal they could. That deal was the
James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement. The 31-chapter accord
covers all aspects of life and development in a 410,000-square-mile
area of northern Quebec.
   In it, the Crees and Inuit agreed to the La Grande River
development under certain conditions. The Crees received an initial
$135 million in cash compensation, which has been invested or used
to create Cree-run businesses such as Cree Construction and Air
Creebec, and more cash in subsequent extensions of the agreement.
   The Crees say future development requires Cree consent, and
they're not giving it.
   Serge Dube, Hydro's counselor on Indian affairs, says the future
development already is conceded in the James Bay and Northern
Quebec Agreement. ``All of the rights for all of the projects are
covered by the agreement,'' Dube says. ``There is no legal ground
to stop it.''
   ``What the project did was wake everybody up,'' says Lameboy.
``We used to think the government would protect us, the government
would not let this happen. Then we woke up to the fact that the
government is pushing this. That they can be the bad guys.
   ``The government is saying the north is open, the sky is the
limit, go help yourself.''

   When Robbie Matthew leans back in a
city armchair and talks about life out on his trapline in northern
Quebec, his eyes glisten, a soft smile spreads across his face.
Come September, he'll be back out there with his family, living in
a muhtukan, hunting and trapping.
   City for Matthew is Chisasibi, a Cree Indian village of 2,500 on
the shore of James Bay, a thumb of water shooting southeast off
Hudson Bay. He comes in from the forest for a few weeks at
Christmas. Then again when the ice breaks.
   ``There, I'm happy,'' he says of the 100-mile-by-40-mile
trapline he runs east of what is now known as the LG2 Reservoir.
``I enjoy the scenery most of all. Every year we go out, even if
fur prices are low. What would I do here, play bingo and watch
hockey on TV? Myself, I like to move about.''
   Matthew calls himself an old man, though he is 56. And he is a
lucky man. The massive, $62 billion James Bay hydroelectric
development project did not destroy his trapline as it did some
others, when it covered the land with thousands of square
kilometers of water.
   Though his trapline is not submerged, he has seen the effects of
building massive dams and dikes on the magnificent La Grande River
and the construction of hundreds of miles of roads and electric
transmission lines.
   Hydro Quebec, the power company owned by the province of Quebec,
says its environmental studies show very little permanent impact on
the wildlife from 15 years of construction. Officials say there is
just as much beaver, lynx, marten, muskrat, caribou, bear and fish
as before.
   But many of the small creeks are now filled up on Matthew's trap
and he says he never sees muskrat any more.
   Each fall, Matthew, his wife, three of his six sons and their
families head for the trap. They construct a winter home of split
logs placed upright and swamp moss _ ``the same stuff we used to
make baby diapers with.'' From there, in cold as much as 45 below
zero, Matthew and his family hunt and trap, taking just enough to
eat and to keep the women busy preparing the furs to sell.
   ``And you come back inside where it is so warm,'' he says,
closing his eyes and almost smelling the fire. ``I love that. No
matter how cold it is outside, it is always warm inside. There all
winter. With your children and grandchildren.''
   Matthew is what is known as a tallyman. He is responsible for
managing the trapline, inherited from his uncle. That involves
doing a yearly inventory of the beaver lodges and other animals on
his trap.
   ``A trapline is like a garden; you have to manage it wisely,''
he says. That includes working some parts of it and letting other
parts rest for two or three years, but not more. Untrapped
territory becomes as unproductive as overtrapped territory.
   The animals also have their say.
   Sometimes the animals don't want to be trapped, Crees say. So a
trapper moves to another area. There must be respect for the
animals or the animals will respond by not letting themselves be
caught.
   Matthew is worried about the caribou. Like all game, they are
cyclical. Caribou are now abundant. But, says Matthew, they are
acting strangely.
   ``Now they are starting to decrease, because of all the forest
fires. The wolves are starting to increase.'' And he is finding
dead caribou in the lakes with no sign of wounds or attack by
animals.
   ``There is something strange happening with the caribou. In the
old days, if he smelled smoke or heard a shot, he would run for
miles. Now, they are not scared anymore. You can practically walk
up and shoot them.
   ``It used to be, we really had to hunt. And you really had to
hide yourself and be careful to kill a caribou. That's one thing I
would like these biologists to do. Is there something wrong with
the caribou?''
   He notices other things, too.
   ``I think some of that acid rain stuff must be getting here. I
had the strange feeling that trees are a slightly different color
than usual in spring.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ While many U.S. military installations are being
closed down, the Army has been building at Fort Drum, N.Y. It's the
Army's largest construction project since World War II. And it's
bringing many changes in the rural area of northern New York, near
the Canadian border.

<TEXT>
   Workers are laying in the last piece of
tile, painting the last wall and putting the other finishing
touches on the U.S. Army's largest construction project since World
War II.
   At a time when experts foresee a major contraction in American
defense spending due to the thaw in U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations, the
Army has spent five years and $1.2 billion building a new home for
its reactivated 10th Mountain Light Infantry Division, a deployable
light infantry division.
   Everything from barracks to bowling alleys and motor pools to
mini-malls has been built for the 10,000 soldiers attached to the
division and about 14,000 members of their families. Another 6,000
people moved into the region as a direct result of the expansion,
officials estimate.
   Construction has gone so well at Fort Drum that the project will
be completed about two months ahead of the January 1991 scheduled
target date.
   But socially, and economically, the influx of so many strange
new faces has been disquieting for some in the rural, insular
communities in the region near the U.S.-Canadian border about 250
miles northwest of New York City.
   ``It's ruined Smalltown U.S.A.,'' says lawyer Jack Scordo, 63, a
lifelong resident of the city of Watertown, located about 10 miles
west of the huge Fort Drum compound. ``The quality of life has
definitely changed. It had what I like to call a rarefied
atmosphere. But that has changed.''
   Men in uniform are nothing new in northern New York. The Army
began staging maneuvers in the area in the early days of the 1900s
and much of the original Fort Drum was constructed during the early
1940s, when the encampment became a major training area for World
War II troops.
   National Guard units from throughout the Northeast have long
used the 107,000-acre installation, the largest in area in the
northeastern United States, for summertime training. In winter, the
Army sends troops to Drum for training in the region's arctic-like
snow and cold.
   Prior to expansion, the Army had based a permanent garrison at
Fort Drum of about 1,000 men to manage the facility.
   But moving the 10th Mountain Division into the fort required the
construction of what amounted to a new city.
   The ``old'' Fort Drum looks as if it could pass for the set of
television's ``Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C.'' The new base, built on 1,800
acres adjacent to the Quonset huts of the original installation,
looks more like a college campus or an industrial park.
   Much of the housing for the soldiers and their families is
located in communities up to 25 miles away from the base.
   The superintendent of one school district that had an influx of
military children said that integration of families into the
communities was a good idea.
   ``We have a true mix within the communities of military-related
people along with the people of the communities themselves,'' said
Kenneth Rishel of the Carthage Central School District. ``We don't
have much `them vs. us' between people from the fort and those from
the villages.''
   Maj. Hyram Bell, a public relations officer at Fort Drum, said
that with housing for 1,900 Army families scattered throughout the
region, there has been much interaction between the soldiers and
civilians.
   ``Our kids go to schools in those areas, shop in the local
stores, go to the same recreational areas and participate in
community activities,'' he said. ``People get to know us.''
   A major worry for Fort Drum officials was problems that black
and Hispanic soldiers and their families could encounter in the
overwhelmingly white region. Prior to the expansion of the fort,
less than 1 percent of the residents of Jefferson County, where the
base is located, were minorities. Nearly one-third of the
division's members are minorities.
   The fort dispatched teams to local schools and chaplains were
sent to local churches to speak about racial harmony. Thus far,
there have been no racial problems.
   Some residents feel the ethnic diversity created by the Fort
Drum expansion has added something to the quality of life.
   ``It's rather nice to see a Korean grocery store,'' said Steve
Lyman, Jefferson County's deputy commissioner of social services.
``You hear some different kinds of music on the radio now. It's
brought some welcome diversity. This was kind of a stagnant area,
the sort of place where kids grew up and left.''
   But while growing up, it was the sort of place where everyone
felt safe. Now, Rishel said, some people complain about having to
lock their doors at night for the first time in their lives.
   Crime has increased in Jefferson County during the past five
years, but Lt. Ed Simser of the sheriff's department said
authorities don't believe the Army personnel or their families are
directly to blame.
   ``With the fort came an increase in population from other
avenues, from workers on the fort and in other industries that have
moved in,'' he said. ``We've seen a definite increase in crime, no
question about it, but we believe it's due more to the population
trends and not Fort Drum specifically.''
   Unemployment has dropped in Jefferson County from 13.3 percent
in 1984 to 6 percent as of June, according to the state Labor
Department. Lyman said that the county's welfare rolls have been
reduced from 2,400 cases before 1985 to about 1,900 now.
   But Scordo argues that the economic benefits promised by
expansion proponents in 1984 and 1985 haven't really materialized.
He said most jobs created by the expansion are low-paying positions
in fast-food restaurants and mall stores, not the high-paying
blue-collar jobs that were a staple of northern New York's economy
for decades until a slump in the 1970s and 1980s.
   Defenders of the project concede that the boom the region
experienced at the height of the construction is over.
   ``We're now settling into a plateau,'' said Mary Parry of the
Greater Watertown Chamber of Commerce.
   She said economic officials want to better develop the region's
tourism industry in light of the Fort Drum expansion. The fort is
not far from the northeastern shore of Lake Ontario and the rivers,
many filled with popular sport fish, that flow into the lake.
   ``These are young people at the fort and their families come up
to see them,'' she said. ``They come as tourists. We want them to
come and see the area.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Two years ago, the tiny Illinois town of Ohio
seemed to be dying, the victim of an aging population and a
shortage of jobs. Today, it is thriving, thanks to an innovative
marketing scheme that brought a renaissance.

<TEXT>
   In an era of dying small towns, Ohio paid a
price to survive. The gritty community of 540 residents offered
cash incentives up to $5,000 to lure newcomers willing to trade
big-city amenities for small-town charm.
   The results surprised everyone.
   Today, vacant homes are virtually non-existent. Most houses
boast fresh paint, neatly mowed lawns and gardens sprouting flowers
and vegetables. There's a new subdivision with sewers, water and
electrical lines, and construction is under way on new houses.
   City leaders also hope to land a federally subsidized housing
project for older residents to free up even more houses for
prospective buyers.
   ``The bounty (money) gets people's attention. But it's not the
key to getting them here,'' says Jack Piper, one of the program's
architects. ``Visitors just get such a warm feeling about the
community. They see why it's such a great place to live.''
   Two years ago, Ohio had little to offer. ``We were suffering
because our kids were moving out, our population was aging and we
didn't have any new jobs,'' Piper says.
   Dick Swanson helped organize a town meeting at which ``we passed
the hat and a couple dozen people chipped in.'' The group formed
the Ohio Growth Foundation to make one last attempt to generate
some expansion.
   In early 1989, the foundation launched a modest marketing
campaign stressing friendly community life, top-notch schools and
crime-free environment, with the cash incentive as the centerpiece.
   The foundation offers grants of $3,000 to anyone buying an
existing house or $5,000 to buyers of newly built houses. The
grants are to pay real estate taxes.
   ``The response was much greater than we anticipated. We weren't
ready for the calls we got,'' Swanson said.
   Ohio resembles dozens of remote towns sprinkled among the
cornfields of rural Illinois. Its classic business district
includes a post office, bank, feed store, beauty parlor, insurance
agent's office, attorney's office, gas station, coffee shop and a
couple of taverns.
   Downtown is dissected by an abandoned railroad right-of-way. The
tracks are long gone, a sign that often signals the demise of
farming communities that developed as rail stops where farmers
shipped crops, bought seed, supplies and groceries and met friends.
   What the railroad left behind in Ohio is Swanson's huge grain
elevator. He now ships grain by truck rather than boxcar.
   The hog sale barn is closed. But Bill Sisler's ice business
thrives, along with his dairy that produces rich ice cream in
flavors like tin roof sundae.
   The loss of rail service left Ohio with intersecting two-lane
blacktops as the only link to Chicago, 105 miles east, and Peoria,
75 miles south.
   Overcoming the remote location wasn't the only obstacle to
growth.
   The transfusion generated by the cash incentive program had to
wait for major surgery on the town's heart: its classic old brick
school, where grades kindergarten through 12 study under one roof
in classrooms overlooking a tiny gymnasium and stage.
   As the town's population dropped over the years, enrollment at
schools dwindled, making it harder to find teachers and
administrators.
   Two years ago, only 40 kids remained in high school and a budget
deficit loomed. Demographic trends pointed to an aging population
and a declining birthrate.
   Rather than close the school and consolidate with another
withering town, residents approved a 40 percent tax increase.
   ``I guess we're crazy, but we think our kids are worth it,''
Piper said. ``It costs a lot to run our school. But we figure, if
we spend money on schools and send them to college, maybe we won't
have to spend a lot of money on jails.''
   But money alone didn't solve the problem. A catalyst was needed
to re-energize teachers and students alike, and integrate new ideas
without disrupting the community's comfortable family environment.
   Frank Dagne was coaxed out of retirement from nearby
Sterling-Rock Falls where he served as school superintendent and
school board member. He agreed to help Ohio find a permanent
administrator.
   Four years later, he's still on the job and has relocated to
Ohio. Dagne has caught Ohio fever and he's glad he did.
   One of his first moves was to hold private fund-raisers to buy a
dozen computers for the school. In two years, he raised $8,000 from
Ohio residents, many of whom don't have children in school.
   Next, he renovated a study hall into a library resource center.
He also hired a retired band director to help build school spirit.
   ``We were down to eight students, most of whom couldn't read
music,'' Dagne said. ``I hired a retired band director, Dick Davis,
and now we have 40 kids in band. They sound great and they are
winning awards. And the community really supports it.
   ``It's an example of the difference in the communal feeling of
this town. People here really are friendlier and concerned about
the kids. They really care.''
   Tony DiCarro saw a news report about what Ohio calls a bounty
while rehabilitating a house in Florida. ``I was looking for the
peace and quiet of a small town,'' said DiCarro, who has relocated
to Ohio and is gutting an old apartment house.
   The cash incentive program has resulted in sales of 24 homes _
leaving just one vacant house in town. And five new homes have been
built.
   The state also helped with small business loans to attract
business, including development of a high technology company, a
restaurant and insurance agency.
   The new businesses created a half-dozen new jobs. ``That doesn't
sound like much activity in most cities, but it's more than has
happened in the last 20 years in Ohio,'' Piper said.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The key to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, the
shrine where Christ was buried, is held by Moslems, to prevent
squabbles among Christians. However, it recently has become a
source of contention between two Moslem families. In Jerusalem,
it's Joudeh vs. Nusseibeh.

   Abdul Khader Joudeh held in his outstretched
hands the rusty, 10-inch iron key that opens the door to the
holiest site in Christendom, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.
   ``This key is from the time of Saladin,'' said Joudeh, a Moslem
whose family has charge of the key as a way of preventing squabbles
among rival Christian sects over rights to the holy shrine.
   Now, however, the key to the shrine where Christ was buried has
set off a jealous conflict between two of Jerusalem's oldest Moslem
families, the Joudehs and Nusseibehs.
   More precisely, the vaunted title ``keeper of the key'' is at
issue.
   Like most such Arab disputes, this one involves tradition,
family pride and a history that may stretch back to the Moslem
conqueror Saladin, or even beyond.
   ``When you are the owner of the key for 800 years, no one can
take this right from you,'' said Jawad Joudeh, a brother of Abdul
Khader. At 65, Jawad is the family elder and official key custodian.
   Wajeeh Nusseibeh of the rival clan, while he grants the Joudehs
hold the key, insists the Nusseibehs' long link to the Holy
Sepulcher gives them the right to the key custodian's title, too.
   ``When the Caliph came to the city of Jerusalem, the key was
given to a member of our family,'' says Nusseibeh, referring to the
Caliph Omar, the first Moslem conqueror of Jerusalem in A.D. 636.
   The Joudehs dispute that claim and trace their own hold on the
key to Saladin, who recaptured Jerusalem from the Christian
Crusaders in 1187.
   Both Omar and Saladin ensured Christian rights to the Holy
Sepulcher under Moslem rule, leading to today's traditions of the
key keeper and the Moslem guards in fezzes who still escort bishops
to the shrine for ceremonies.
   The current squabble began last spring when the Holy Sepulcher
was closed to protest an effort by Jewish settlers to take over a
building in Jerusalem's Christian Quarter. News reports at the time
referred to Nusseibeh as ``keeper of the key.''
   The Joudehs were mortified.
   ``I heard it on Radio Amman, then on Radio Cairo,'' said Abdul
Khader. ``I felt we had been deprived of our rights.''
   The family put statements of protest in two of Jerusalem's
Arabic newspapers. Jawad wrote letters to reporters, and Abdul
Khader came with documents to news agency offices.
   When the family was invited to tell its story, the Joudeh
delegation consisted of the two brothers, a cousin, a friend and
Abdul Khader's 24-year-old son Ahab, a graduate student at George
Washington University in Washington, D.C.
   The Joudehs brought firmans, or decrees, from the Ottoman
Turkish sultans who ruled Palestine for 400 years to show the
family's long possession of the key.
   The family's argument, explained over cups of thick Arabic
coffee, is that the Nusseibehs are the ``door keepers'' of the
church, not the key keepers.
   The Joudehs turn the key over to the Nusseibehs who then must
climb a ladder to reach the keyhole, insert the key and finally do
the physical labor of pushing open the heavy wooden door.
   This tradition came about, Abdul Khader explained, because of
the stature of his family.
   ``They were all sheiks,'' he said. ``How could they open the
church? How could they push the door? Everyone was coming to kiss
their hands. So the Nusseibeh family was assigned as doorkeepers.''
   Abdul Khader added that the Nusseibehs gained some note over the
years, including in its numbers government ministers during
Jordanian rule.
   ``They don't want to say they are doorkeepers but that is what
they are,'' he added.
   The Joudehs and the Nusseibehs agree on one thing. The origin of
the key being put in Moslem hands was not to stop fights among
Christians, though it evolved into that.
   The first reason was Saladin's fear that Crusaders would try to
regain the church. Later, money got involved when taxes were levied
on Christian pilgrims, with proceeds going to Moslem charities and
the families controlling the door.
   ``At the time of the Ottoman Empire...we were receiving a good
income,'' said Abdul Khader.
   The practice of taxing pilgrims ended in the 1800s, however.
Wajeeh Nusseibeh says that together the two families now get about
$20 a month from the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Armenian
churches.
   ``It doesn't cover transportation or breakfast or dinner for
even one day,'' he added. ``We do the job out of pride.''
   In fact, both families pay workers actually to open the church
at 4:30 a.m. each day and close it in the evening. The Joudehs and
Nusseibehs only open the doors on special occasions like Easter.
   Wajeeh Nusseibeh, 39, took over his church duties when his
father died in 1982. He maintained that his family was not only
given the key to the church by Caliph Omar but again by Saladin
after he drove the Crusaders from Jerusalem.
   ``Saladin asked for the key from the Nusseibehs and he gave it
back,'' he said.
   He added that the Joudehs got involved in the process later.
   Nusseibeh said he accepts the Joudehs' job descriptions _ that
they hold the key and he opens the door. ``I believe it's important
who opens the door,'' he added.
   What bothers him is the suggestion that his family has no
association with the key, that the Nusseibehs are somehow late
arrivals in the Arab history of Jerusalem.
   ``We came before the Joudehs,'' he said. ``We are the most
ancient family in Jerusalem.''
   And in this battle of firmans and families, who is right?
   It turns out both Joudehs and Nusseibehs are partly right,
according to the ``Status Quo,'' the rules on rights to Jerusalem's
holy sites that were formulated by the Turks, cataloged under
British rule of Palestine and still used by Israel.
   The idea was to keep the Christians from fighting among
themselves, and the Turks were precise. Their rules say which
candle in the Holy Sepulcher each Christian sect may light, which
scrap of floor it must sweep.
   As for the church door, the ``Status Quo'' states the tradition
of Moslem guardians dates from the time of Caliph Omar. But it
makes no mention of Saladin's awarding of the key.
   It says, though, that when Moslems fully dislodged the Crusaders
from Jerusalem in 1289, ``the custody of the keys was given to the
family of El Insaibi (Nusseibeh) to prevent disputes between the
various Christian communities.''
   Later, the document says, the guardianship was divided with the
``Judeh'' family. It adds:
   ``This is the position at the present time, the Judeh family
holding the keys and the Insaibi having charge of the actual
opening of the door.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Rougham Airfield may go the way of its planes
and fliers _ into history. But for the moment, there are still
reminders of what some American servicemen accomplished nearly 50
years ago during the dark days of World War II.

   Silence and fog hung over what
was left of a runway at Rougham Airfield, where American fliers had
roared off to raid German targets during World War II.
   The peacefulness contrasted with my grandfather's memories of
the U.S. 8th Air Force base: the rumble of scores of engines in the
air; dogfights overhead; a B-17 landing with heavy battle damage,
every man aboard wounded, every cartridge aboard fired, the
aircraft itself dripping blood.
   Cpl. T. Morgan Daniel had served as a mechanic here with the
94th Bomb Group, 331st Squadron, during World War II.
   He doubted anything remained of this airfield. But on a side
trip during a vacation, I found remnants of runways, huts used for
storage and housing, a control tower and a community that still
identifies itself by what Americans did here almost 50 years ago.
   Rougham is in the East Anglia region of England, flat farm
country juting into the North Sea, its location and terrain
tailor-made for air bases designed to hit Germany and occupied
Europe.
   Inside the Flying Fortress pub on the base site, the walls are
lined with photographs of men in leather jackers, crouched in neat
rows before planes painted with what was called nose art. Cartoons
illustrated the planes' nicknames. Eighth Air Force bombers sported
names such as ``Royal Flush,'' ``Southern Comfort,'' ``The Eagle's
Wrath'' and ``Rain of Terror.''
   A wooden plaque in the pub carries the ``A'' that adorned the
tails of the bombers that flew from here, and says, ``94th Bomb
Group, 1942-1945.''
   The pub also features a print showing B-17s in flight. The
painting looked familiar: I had seen it before in my grandfather's
house, the handiwork of a comrade in arms.
   An American accent and a mention of the 8th Air Force brings a
warm welcome in Bury St. Edmunds and at the Flying Fortress.
``There is an awful lot of good feeling toward the Americans who
were here during the war,'' said Keith Allchin, the pub's owner.
   The feeling is mutual. My grandfather used to talk fondly about
the hospitality of the English and dinners at their homes.
   Allchin said up to 400 American veterans have visited since the
Flying Fortress opened in December 1988.
   ``They're pleased to think they're remembered,'' he said. ``They
seem to think a lot of people have forgotten all about them.''
   Veterans and those visiting on behalf of veterans are asked to
sign a guest book kept at the bar. A bartender also gave me a map
of Rougham as it was during wartime to help identify what remains.
   Finding those remnants isn't easy. Rougham Airfield, originally
a British Royal Air Force base, was camouflaged in its time.
   ``The Luftwaffe bombed all around us but they never found us,''
my grandfather used to say.
   And for all practical purposes Rougham is still camouflaged.
   A narrow, twisting road leads from Bury St. Edmunds to the
airfield site, or the aerodrome, as the British call it. Other than
the pub's sign, nothing visible on Mount Road indicates that part
of the air power that liberated Europe was launched from here.
   An official military account of the 8th Air Force's first year
over Europe quotes Virgil: ``Germany heard a clashing of arms all
over the sky; the Alps trembled with uncommon earthquakes... Never
did lightnings fall in greater quantities from a serene sky, or
dire thunders blaze so often.''
   Local residents confirmed that part of Rougham Airfield still
existed and provided directions.
   Amid fields of wheat, barley and sugar beets, one finds part of
the runways, cracked and broken. In a heavy mist, they appear to
recede into the past, and a walk down one of them seems to go on
forever. Instead of warplanes, tractors now roll down the runways.
Farmers use some of the airmen's huts as storage sheds.
   In a heavy British fog, the kind that might have grounded a
bombing mission, the huts materialize like ghosts as one approaches.
   A bumpy, muddy path leads to what had been the control tower.
Locals say an elderly woman made the tower her home until her death
about 18 months ago. The tower is now hidden among trees and high
weeds.
   Rougham Industrial Estate, a small industrial park, has grown up
around other buildings.
   And some of those structures have found a modern use, according
to Allchin.
   ``A hanger itself is a seed storage depot,'' Allchin said. He
also said an environmental group is refurbishing the old chapel and
gym to turn it into a village hall.
   Eventually, Rougham Airfield may go the way of its planes and
fliers, into history. Allchin said a developer is seeking
permission to build housing on the site.
   The lightning and thunder launched against targets such as
German aircraft factories and submarine pens have long since
stilled. But at least for now, one can find a few silent reminders.

   Lucie Arnaz says that her new CBS drama
``Sons and Daughters'' is a series that has something to say about
everyone.
   That's a broad statement, but she thinks the series title, a
last-minute change from ``The Hammersmiths,'' helps.
   ``When people ask me what the new name means I ask, `Are you a
son or a daughter?'.
   ``When they say yes, I say, `It's about you.' It's a name that
says something about parenting and being a son or a daughter.''
   She says, ``It's not a show that's easy to explain and `The
Hammersmiths' didn't give you a clue.''
   ``Sons and Daughters,'' a one-hour show on Thursday nights with
a 13-member ensemble cast, is about a lot of offspring _ mostly the
spawn of Bing Hammersmith. There are four generations of
Hammersmiths, with the ``thirtysomething'' sons and daughters as
the major focus.
   ``I play Tess Hammersmith, and she's a survivor, like some of my
favorite people in the world,'' says Arnaz. ``She's trying to make
ends meet. She's trying to be a good soul to her daughter. We all
have stuff that happens to us that make us swear our family's
crazier than any other.
   ``Being a parent is one of the most important things in the
world, but you don't need a license for it and no one gets any
training. Tess's father, Bing, had a traveling job and was never
home. Her mother got fed up and walked out, forcing Tess at 15 to
be the reluctant mother to her brother and sister.''
   The series opens with Bing (Don Murray) unexpectedly returning
home with a new young wife (Lisa Blount) and a baby son. He wants
to reclaim the house that Tess has been living in with her adopted
daughter.
   The series also stars Peggy Smithhart as Tess' sister Patty,
Rick Rossovich as Patty's husband, Scott Plank as Tess'
status-conscious brother and Stacy Edwards as his wife.
   ``Sons and Daughters'' is set in Portland, Ore. ``I tell people
we're in the town next to `Twin Peaks,''' says Arnaz, referring to
the offbeat mystery series set in Washington state featuring the
murder of a high school girl.
   She says her show is also more true to life than ``Father Knows
Best,'' ``The Donna Reed Show'' or ``Here's Lucy,'' in which she
and her brother, Desi Arnaz Jr., starred with their mother, Lucille
Ball.
   ``It's fascinating raising kids,'' she says. ``I have three
kids, each two years apart and each going through a phase.'' Her
husband is actor Laurence Luckinbill.
   ``Larry also has joint custody of two older children,'' Arnaz
says. ``His ex-wife, Robin Strasser, lives two blocks away. She's
an enormous help, let me tell you. The day my mother died she was
at my doorstep and took care of the kids. I was in shock.''
   Arnaz made her acting debut in ``Here's Lucy'' in 1968. In 1985
she starred very briefly in ``The Lucie Arnaz Show.'' She has spent
much of her career on stage, but she has also been in feature
movies including a major role in ``The Jazz Singer'' and such TV
movies as ``Who Is the Black Dahlia?,'' ``Washington Mistress,''
``The Mating Season'' and ``Who Gets the Friends?''
   Her husband is currently working on a Broadway musical about her
father called ``Desi.''
   ``Larry's writing the musical and I'm sort of protecting it from
my brother and my side of the family,'' she says. Some relatives
may not like it.
   ``It's been a longstanding project. Larry only recently turned
it into a musical. We originally took it to CBS as a TV movie.
Larry worked on the script with Bernard Dilbert of `M.A.S.H.' In
1987 it went out with a lot of other CBS projects.
   ``In the process of doing the TV movie my father passed away. I
kept telling him, `You're going to get well; you're going to see
it.' I made a personal pact that I was going ahead with this one.''
   The stage musical is the life story of her father in which his
marriage and collaboration with Lucille Ball on ``I Love Lucy'' is
only part of an astonishing rags-to-riches saga.
   ``It's the story of a Cuban immigrant who lost everything at 18
to come to a country where his race was thought of only as waiters
and busboys,'' she says. ``He was a hero to the Hispanic people. It
shows that you can rise above the stereotype.''
   Meanwhile, CBS is planning a movie about Lucy and Desi. Arnaz
denies that she is opposed to the venture, but says, ``I don't want
to be involved with telling that story on film right now.''

<HEAD>End of Land-Idling Contracts Will Mean More Crops in Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By the turn of the century, American farmers
are going to gain at least 34 million acres of cropland, a
potential surge in production capacity that already has some people
concerned.
   The ``additional'' cropland is currently tied up in the
government's Conservation Reserve Program under 10-year contracts
that will begin to expire in 1996. The last of the CRP land will be
freed up in 1999.
   Some refinements of the CRP are included in 1990 farm bills
passed by the House and Senate, including amendments to extend the
enrollment period through the 1995 crop year. Those details will be
worked out in conference negotiations in the coming weeks.
   But the basic program, authorized in the 1985 farm law, remains
pretty much the same as set up by the Agriculture Department.
Signups began in 1986 and the last were held a year ago.
   Even without the uncertainties caused by federal budgetary
pressures and the pressures on Congress to tinker with the program,
it's tough to make predictions about the future of CRP and its
impact on agricultural production.
   A recent report by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, cited a number of factors that
relate to the future of U.S. crop production and, therefore, the
CRP:
   _Natural conditions, which could limit the available land for
agricultural use and could influence the quality or quantity of
production. National conditions include location, climate, soil
conditions and proximity to water.
   _Economic conditions, including the price and availability of
labor and capital. Also, it would include domestic and
international patterns of production and consumption, and exports
and imports.
   _Public policies, including federal, state and local efforts
that directly or indirectly influence agricultural production.
Local zoning regulation for the control of pesticides could
influence yields, for example.
   The GAO report, looking at the possibilities for stepped-up
production once the long-term CRP contracts have expired, said much
will depend on decisions of individual farmers on whether to
continue idling their land or returning it to productive use.
   ``For example, about 6 percent of the CRP acreage has been
planted with trees,'' the report said. ``Assumptions about the
extent to which these 2 million acres of trees will be cleared and
returned to cropland would be a consideration in determining the
CRP's impact on production.''
   The CRP is expected to cost the government about $14.6 billion
over the life of its contracts.
   About $13 billion comes from the annual rental payments received
by farmers for idling and protecting their land. Those payments
average about $49 per acre per year. Farmers also get initial
cost-sharing for planting grass or trees to protect the soil.
   Thus, the CRP makes a significant contribution to farm income,
and producers faced with the end of payments will be making
decisions on what to do next.
   ``Because farmers will not be obligated to maintain the CRP
conservation covers (grass and trees) after contracts expire, most
CRP land is likely to revert to crop production if prices and
commodity programs are favorable,'' says an Agriculture Department
analysis.
   This will not be a wholesale acre-for-acre switch back to crop
production. Compliance provisions of other parts of federal law
relating to conservation will continue to be factors, and lawmakers
in the next several years may make further modifications.
   Meanwhile, the analysis by the department's Economic Research
Service shows that the CRP is helping boost market prices and farm
income by reducing crop production from levels that otherwise would
be attained.
   Overall, that may amount to $2.1 billion to $6.3 billion over
the life of the CRP, the report said. This would be in addition to
the $13 billion in total annual rental payments.
   ``After 1995, when land initially enrolled in the CRP may come
back into production, net farm income will begin to slide as crop
prices drift down,'' the report said.
   On the consumer side, the report said retail food costs ``are
increasing less than 1 percent in any year'' because of the land
idled under CRP.
   ``But, in total, the present value of CRP-related increases in
consumer costs is estimated to be $2.9 billion to $7.8 billion over
the program's life,'' the report said.

   OK. It's summer. It's hot. Who wants to cook?
Not too many of us, nor do we wish to pig out the way some of us do
when there's snow on the ground or when chestnuts roast in an open
fire.
   Despite the heat and ennui, there's still a mild interest in
food. But if you'd rather look at it than eat it, there are a few
videos available in which food _ or eating _ plays a key role.
Here's a partial list:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Airplane!'' (1980): Who ate and did not eat the fish figures
in this spoof.
   ``Babette's Feast'' (1988): Award-winning film from Denmark,
starring blini with black caviar, quail stuffed with foie gras and
truffle sauce, turtle soup and other tasty morsels.
   ``Country'' (1984): While the the government tries to take the
farm, Jessica Lange fries chicken, bakes bread, fries eggs, flips
pancakes and otherwise provides a hearty bounty for her family and
for the film-going audience in this powerful drama.
   ``The Dead'' (1987): John Huston's last movie, adapted from the
James Joyce short story about a group of women who give a dinner
party.
   ``Dinner at Eight'' (1933): George Cukor takes us on a merry
romp with John Barrymore, Jean Harlow and Billie Burke.
   ``Eating Raoul'' (1982): Paul Bartel's very funny look at a real
neat way to beat the recession _ literally.
   ``Eat the Rich'' (1987): A waiter gets fired from a toney
restaurant. He seeks his revenge upon the rich by serving them up
in his new restaurant. Pretty tasteless, but it has its moments.
   ``The Four Seasons'' (1981): The joys and sorrows of three
couples who remain friends through thick and thin and lots of food,
directed by Alan Alda.
   ``Hamburger _ The Motion Picture'' (1986): A limp, silly send-up
of the fast-food business. Too bad, because the industry begs to be
blasted, but this movie only fizzes.
   ``Heartburn'' (1986): Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson play out
writer Nora Ephron's neurotic marriage to journalist Carl Bernstein
amid the recipe du jour.
   ``Men Don't Leave'' (1989): Jessica Lange again. This time
baking her little heart out for a gourmet shop in Baltimore in
order to support herself and children after her husband's death.
   ``My Dinner With Andre'' (1981): Two men chat over dinner.
   ``Mystic Pizza'' (1988): A delightful coming of age movie set in
a Mystic, Conn., restaurant that serves the best pizza in the East.
   ``A Private Funciton'' (1985): Michael Palin and Maggie Smith
star as a timid foot doctor and his aggressive wife who get caught
up in the black market food business in World War II England. The
real star is the pig.
   ``Soylent Green'' (1973): Like hot dogs and most junk food, once
you find out what's in Soylent Green, you won't want to eat any.
   ``Tampopo'' (1987): How to make the perfect noodle.
   ``Tom Jones'' (1963): A brilliant and bawdy tale through Tony
Richardson's lens. The seductive eating scene was a trendsetter.
   ``What's Up, Tiger Lily'' (1966): Never has egg salad been so
important.A peculiar Japanese spy movie with a Woody Allen
translation.

   ``Das Rheingold'' (Deutsche Grammophon) _ conducted by James
Levine, played by Metropolitan Opera orchestra
   
   The second installment in the Metropolitan Opera's complete
recording of Wagner's Ring Cycle is a disappointment, a distinctly
routine ``Rheingold.''
   Don't fault the singing or the orchestral playing. Both are
first-rate, as one would expect. Rather the problem seems to lie
with conductor James Levine, whose reading of the score too often
falls flat. It lacks the fire and energy that made Solti's
recording a classic, and rarely conjures up the chamber-music
effect that distinguished Karajan's interpretation.
   The cast is mostly familiar to anyone who has seen the
production at the Met or who watched the recent television version
on PBS. James Morris is a sturdy, resonant Wotan; Christa Ludwig is
expressive as Fricka, his wife; Siegfried Jerusalem is superb as
Loge, the wily demigod. Ekkehard Wlaschiha and Heinz Zednik make a
strong pair of brother dwarfs, Alberich and Mime; Birgitta Svenden
is effective in Erda's solo.
   A couple of cast changes are improvements over the staged
performances. Hei-Kyung Hong's soprano adds luster to the role of
the lead Rhinemaiden, Woglinde; bass Kurt Moll sings the part of
the giant Fasolt so beautifully he makes him downright sympathetic,
the way the late Martti Talvela did on the Karajan recording.
   But the big moments in ``Rheingold'' are orchestral rather than
vocal _ the creation-of-the-world opening measures; the interludes
before and after the Nibelungen scene with the sound of hammers
clinking on anvils; the brassy entrance of the gods into Valhalla.
The orchestra plays all the music flawlessly, but a spark is
missing. Somehow the whole adds up to less than the sum of its
parts.
   The recording of ``Die Walkuere'' that launched the project was
far livelier. Maybe matters will improve again with ``Siegfried''
and ``Goetterdaemmerung.''

   ``After the Rain'' (DGC) _ Nelson
   
   Many critics found it hard to take the late Rick Nelson
seriously because of his status as a teenybopper favorite _ harder
than it should have been.
   His identical twin sons, Matthew and Gunnar Nelson, could face
the same problem as they launch a career leading a five-piece band
with their father's surname. Their looks strike you before their
music _ the twins inherited their father's classic face and add
oceans of blond hair.
   So how's the music? Not half bad, actually. This is Metal Lite,
the kind that appeals to teen-age girls, not boys. It's not
terribly demanding, of course, and while Nelson doesn't transcend
the genre, Ricky's boys don't embarrass themselves, either.
   Matthew and Gunnar's voices mesh nicely on a string of earnestly
sung cliches. Most of the record is what radio programmers call
``power ballads,'' heavy metal love songs with the drums, guitars
and synthesizers muted a bit. Brett Garsed's guitar work is strong
without adding too much histrionics, particularly on ``(Can't Live
Without Your) Love and Affection.''
   Now if they could only write a song like their sister Tracy, who
helped Guns N' Roses pen ``Sweet Child 'O Mine...''

<HEAD>Star Watch: Mel Gibson Enjoyed Exotic Film Location</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many film stars return from far-off locations
with tales of peril and privation. Now listen to Mel Gibson, who
spent three months in the mountainous jungles near the poppy fields
of the Golden Triangle of Southeast Asia:
   ``It's a neat place, you know. It's not so unpleasant. The food
is great; it's hard to get a bad feed there. The dogs are a little
mangy; you gotta watch out for rabies and stuff_ don't walk around
at night. The people are absolutely charming. The culture is old
and rich and amazingly simple.''
   Gibson went to Thailand for the filming of ``Air America,'' a
Tri-Star Pictures action-adventure about CIA operations in Laos
during the Vietnam War. It looks like a physically strenuous shoot,
but you won't hear any complaint on that score, either.
   ``It wasn't too bad,'' says Gibson. ``I think the most strenuous
thing I did was cut out of the picture. So it isn't worth talking
about.''
   The star's good feelings may partly be due to his reported
salary of $8 million, plus a cut of the profits. Beyond that, Mel
maintains a cheerful attitude about the good fortune that has
befallen him during his unexpected movie career. That makes him
unique amid a new generation of actors who seem to suffer under the
pressures of stardom.
   Air America was the name of the CIA's secret airline that
operated in Southeast Asia from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s.
The film is partly based on the book by Christopher Robbins, who
wrote that the CIA ``maintained a secret mercenary army in Laos.''
The cargo included refugees, ammunition, counterfeit money as well
as bushels of opium transported for local war lords, said Robbins.
   Gibson and Robert Downey Jr. are among the ragtag group of
pilots flying the rugged terrain. To ease into the role, Gibson
took lessons in helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft ``so I could at
least know what to do, what it felt like. I enjoyed it. There's a
safer feeling when you can understand it more.''
   Until he read the script, Gibson was unaware of the secret
operations in Laos. ``The picture tells about it in a primer
fashion, and it's informative. But I don't think most Americans did
know about it.'' He observed, incidentally, that the head of the
CIA at that time was _ George Bush. ``Anyway,'' he added quickly,
``I'm not on a witch hunt.''
   After appearing in high-energy films like the ``Mad Max'' cycle
and the two ``Lethal Weapons,'' Mel Gibson surprised everyone by
taking on the title role in Franco Zefferelli's ``Hamlet.'' Mel
Gibson as the gloomy Dane? Is something off-kilter in Denmark?
   ``I liked the story, it's a great story,'' he explained. ``It's
a very tragic story: it's all about bad timing. Why do it? Why not
do it, because it was sitting there for the taking and it was
offered to me on nothing less than a silver plate? I couldn't see
any reason not to.''
   He added that he had done Shakespeare as a young actor in
Australia, ``but on the stage; he didn't write for the screen, did
he? That's why it's a little tricky for celluloid. It's only two
hours instead of four and a half.''
   Gibson, who costars with Glenn Close, said Zefferelli fixed on a
``standard English sound'' for the actors: ``It required a kind of
uniformity, since you couldn't have a Utah cowboy amid the likes of
Alan Bates, Paul Scofield and Ian Holm, pretty good actors who know
their Shakespeare.''
   Mel Gibson's dual nationality, along with his good looks,
contribute to the immense popularity he now enjoys after a dozen
films. He spent his first 12 years in upstate New York, then moved
with his large family _ he was sixth among 11 children _ to Sydney.
After his graduation from the National Institute of Dramatic Arts,
he was picked by director George Miller to play ``Mad Max.''
   His first international films _ ``The Bounty,'' ``The River,''
``Mrs. Soffel''_ were unsuccessful, but Gibson made his box-office
mark with ``Lethal Weapon.'' Now his choice of projects is
unlimited.
   A devout Catholic, Gibson, 34, strives to maintain a balance
between career and family; he and his wife now have six children,
including 7-year-old twins. He tries to take them all along
wherever he works.
   ``We had to suspend that because of the `Air America'
location,'' he said.
   ``I didn't want to risk going through all that business of
inoculations and kids in the jungle and talk about the snakes.
   ``Geography and time permitting, they go to school wherever we
are. There's a sense of semi-permanence about their education, but
they're getting one. Cultural shock? They get a cultural
smorgasbord, and that can't be bad.
   ``It's rounded and educational for everyone.''
   The Gibsons now have a base here, but their principal home
remains an Australian cattle ranch. Mel wants it known that he is
no mere gentleman rancher.
   ``It's all happening there: genetics, embryo transfers,
cryogenic tanks with liquid oxygen, embryos shipped from above the
45th parallel, because of the disease problem below the 45th,'' he
said. ``Then there's the genetic part at the end: what you end up
with walking around on the ground. A cow with a sheep's head. No,
not really. It's not genetic engineering.
   ``They're really nice animals. You can practically map out what
you want and be sure of hitting fairly near the mark. You can do in
three years what took your grandfather all his life.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Art Sleuths Weeding Out Masterworks From Also Rans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. (AP) _ It's been a long, strange trip
for the oil painting of the nude woman and Cupid now hanging in a
Bard College gallery.
   The painting was found years ago in a hayloft with a modest fig
leaf painted on Cupid and the chubby, prone woman's breasts
enlarged. A private collector bought the painting, removed the
bogus overpainting and cleaned it over three years.
   The collector, who refuses to reveal his identity, says he's
convinced the painting was created in a Venice studio by Titian,
one of the greatest painters of the Italian Renaissance.
   The art world isn't so sure.
   That puts the purported Titian in the same boat as many of the
80 works of art exhibited at ``A Connoisseur's Quest,'' a new
gallery exposition at this Hudson Valley college.
   Paintings from Europe, carvings from Africa and ancient Egyptian
pottery are coming under scrutiny for the first time as art
detectives try to weed out bonafide masterpieces from artful
forgeries.
   Art historians and others who breath the rarefied air of the art
world have begun debating whether particular works are really
Raphael's or Durer's or El Greco's.
   ``Some of these pieces will be shrouded in mystery for the rest
of their existence,'' said Linda Weintraub, curator of the Edith C.
Blum gallery.
   The exhibit, which Weintraub shepherded here, is unique in that
the pieces are being shown to the public for the first time after
being held in a private collection for decades _ some for up to 50
years.
   The collector credits Weintraub, a longtime acquaintance, with
persuading him to share his private treasure with the public after
all these years. His identity though, remains hidden so as not to
deflect attention from the art, he said.
   ``The object of the collection is not the collector. The object
is the art,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``I'm glad to have
it scrutinized.''
   The scrutiny in this case means students of art looking for
subtle clues that would place a work in time, or a technique that
would distinguish a creation as belonging to a particular artist.
   The question with the picture of the nude woman and Cupid is
whether the painting is a first version of Titian's ``Danae,''
which depicts the picture's namesake just after being impregnated
by Zeus.
   Weintraub said such aficionados as former Metropolitan Museum of
Art curator Thomas Hoving have applied their critical eye to the
work and believe it to have come from the brush of Titian.
   One dissenting voice comes from artist Martin Canin who says
``the painting lacks the quality of execution'' to be a real Titian.
   ``I'm sure it's not,'' he said. ``There's just too many bad
passages.''
   Canin said his painter's eyes can see what many art historians
cannot. In ``Danae,'' he sees an un-Titian-like linear approach to
the work and an ``amateurish'' painting of the figures' feet and
toes. Canin thinks the painting was a product of a contemporary
workshop or student.
   A big problem with sorting out the works of the European masters
is that most of them trained their young students to paint just
like them _ often exactly like them. Weintraub said many students
were instructed to paint over the master's sketches and even copy
their work outright.
   ``Even pieces with signatures can easily have been done by
students,'' she said.
   Also, in the days before photocopiers or even photos, copying
the great contemporary works by hand for affluent buyers was a
common practice.
   Unlike people who study stones or stars, art sleuths usually
rely on more esoteric means to weed out masterworks from copies.
   Bonnie Solomon, an art restorer with Solomon &amp; Mattozzi of New
York City, shined a black light on ``Danae'' to determine if the
work was fudged with overpainting.
   ``There was some work done on it, but not a lot,'' she said.
Solomon said she's pretty sure the Titian is the real thing along
with another possible masterpiece by the European master El Greco,
but admitted there are some incredible fakes in existence.
   The presumed El Greco, a palm-sized painting of Christ at
Calvary looking imploringly up to heaven, could represent the
finest of the painter's work.
   Then again, just like the Titian, it could be the work of one of
his rivals or students, or any exceptionally talented painter
familiar with El Greco's work.
   ``This could be a student's, it could be a copy, it could be
from 200 years after his death,'' Weintraub said. ``But look at his
eyes. How could it be by anyone else?''
   Even established works of art can become suspect. Vincent Van
Gogh's ``Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' is familiar to anyone who
has ever flipped through an art book. The painting has been in the
Metropolitan for years as one of the pearls in its collection. Now,
a leading scholar has raised questions about its authenticity.
   ``There's little certainty about any work,'' Weintraub offered.
   Paintings for non-European works are less problematic in terms
of determining the creator. Artisans kept a lower public profile in
most other cultures and so works by any particular person tend to
be less in demand in the art world.
   But they do pose other problems.
   ``Some of these works, we just have no idea where they're
from,'' Weintraub said.
   Works shown in the Bard exhibit such as the Chinese Buddha and
little icons of Egyptian deities are easy to trace, but others
aren't. Experts agree a small, carved ivory spoon shown at Bard is
from Africa. But where, when and even the why of the spoon is
debatable.
   ``All the scholars are bewildered,'' Weintraub said. ``Even if
there's a consensus, it's never absolutely known.''
   Still, the mystery collector says he's relatively unconcerned
that someone might soon come up with some devastating evidence his
Durer or ancient Greek coins are not what they appear to be.
   ``I bought all the work for its visual power,'' he said. ``It
wouldn't change the effectiveness of the work one bit.''

   John Hiatt is basically a sentimental kind of
fellow, though you'd never guess from those Dust Bowl eyes, 5
o'clock shadow and paisley tie.
   But talk about rock 'n' roll heroes, Elvis Presley or Bob Dylan,
and Hiatt gets a little misty-eyed, a little nostalgic. ``Isn't
that cool,'' he says, his voice lifting slightly as he thinks about
the days when Elvis could top the pop, country and R&amp;B charts with
just one song.
   And Dylan, he still remembers the summer of 1965, sitting in a
car as a teen-ager when ``Like a Rolling Stone'' came on the radio,
wondering if his mother would realize her son's life had changed by
the time of the next commercial.
   Hiatt is from Indiana, and that means the heartland, with all
the corny talk of family and the outdoors. Don't expect him to run
for office, but this is one rocker with plenty to say about the
wife and kids, and the music that sprang from ``this fair land of
ours.''
   ``Yeah, you surprise yourself when you find out how really
traditional you really are,'' Hiatt said in an interview at the
Manhattan offices of A&amp;M Records. ``Especially when you fancy
yourself kind of a wild, rebellious, angry-young-man sort of guy.
   ``A lot of it comes from the idea of coming from the Midwest and
not having a strong cultural background, in a traditional, melting
pot kind of American way. It's almost like being a blank, fill it
in as you learn about it. It's kind of an adventure, booting around
like a wild hedgehog.''
   The jokes come easy now for Hiatt, no small achievement for a
man who knows a few things about drugs and death and life on the
road. ``Stolen Moments,'' the followup to his acclaimed ``Slow
Turning'' album, is his happiest, most personal record, with brick
houses and sleeping babies and a tall tale about a guy leaving town
in the back of a pickup truck.
   ``A little encouragement goes a long way with me,'' he said of
the response to ``Slow Turning'' and the cover version of Hiatt's
``Thing Called Love'' by Bonnie Raitt. ``I've never been so at ease
with the process of record making.
   ``I think this record's got a kind of celebratory tone to it.
I'm just kind of grooving on the fun of it. I had a wonderful time
in the studio and I learned a whole bunch. I hung out for the
mixes, which is something I've never done. That's a real step
forward.''
   On ``Stolen Moments,'' you'll learn a few things about Hiatt's
father, Robert Hiatt. He was a storyteller, his son remembers,
who'd gather the kids in the living room and imagine them on great
adventures _ incredible adventures _ in all kinds of places.
   That's what ``Seven Little Indians'' is about, but as Hiatt
tells it, real life was never that way. His older brother, Michael,
committed suicide when Hiatt was nine. Two years later, his father
died. ``In that old brick house it always felt like something was
moving for the kill,'' Hiatt sings. ``They started dropping like
flies.''
   ``I found myself out on the road on the `Slow Turning' tour,''
Hiatt explained, ``and all of a sudden it seemed like my father was
everywhere.
   ``I don't know why it was that way. At 35 or 36, all of a sudden
these `dad' things should come up. But that happened. A lot of
these things came from just riding around in the back of the bus.''
   Hiatt, born in 1952, dropped out of high school and drifted. He
wrote songs in Nashville, Tenn., earning $25 a week. He toured in
44 states. Made albums in every style you'd care to name. There
were two bad marriages, his second wife committing suicide. He was
hooked on heroin, kicked it, and got addicted to alcohol instead.
   ``Back of My Mind,'' a country rocker, tells how he survived,
and Hiatt sounds amazed about it still, sitting back and telling
his tale like a soldier spinning an old war story.
   It's all there _ watching his dad at the foot of the stairs,
taking to the highway, ``just a lookin' and a hopin' to find some
solutions, some answers,'' taking a wife, hitting the bottle and
almost losing everything.
   But he turns it around, right in the middle of the song: ``Well
the end of the tunnel, it never came up, 'til I came to the end of
the line. And I saw that the light I'd had been hoping to see was
just a spark in the back of my mind.''
   In 1985, he joined Alcoholics Anonymous, where he met his
current wife, Nancy, and cleaned himself up. Two years later, he
issued ``Bring the Family,'' receiving some of his best reviews,
and topped it in 1988 with ``Slow Turning.''
   ``The similarity I see between myself and John Cougar Mellencamp
is he seems to do his best work as he gets into his 30s,'' Hiatt
said of his fellow Indiana rocker.
   ``I see myself as a late bloomer, though I kind of consider
myself a bit of a knucklehead. My friend calls me a `knucklehead
savant,' a step up from idiot savant, but not much.''
   And that's how it is for a man who never expected life to turn
out so well. It really is a stolen moment, he'll tell you, a time
to just take in every second, when it's so much easier to think
about the past because you're feeling so good about what's going to
happen the following day.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: A Smooth Landing for John Casey</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   John Casey began writing ``Spartina'' in 1979 at
the worst time of his life. One of his former students, a talented
author, had committed suicide. His father died and his marriage was
breaking up.
   The book came slowly. It started as a short story called ``The
Mean Story,'' and was continously revised. The central character,
Dick Pierce, was a cranky Rhode Island fisherman, about 40 years
old, like the author himself.
   When he was finished, nearly 10 years later, Pierce was still a
pretty difficult fellow, but a little more likable, a middle-aged
man with a wife, two kids, a lover and an unfinished boat called
``Spartina'' in his back yard.
   ``People who are simply good or simply bad are harder to write
about,'' Casey explained in an interview to promote ``Spartina''
which has been released in paperback by Avon Books.
   ``It's not the way most of us are. Most of us are pretty bad
hoping to get better. Sometimes if you can just observe the
process, the accidents involved in getting better, that's the real
purpose of fiction.
   ``There's an enormous grace in nature, as well as a grace to
people.''
   He speaks in a voice as rough as saltwater. You can't get much
further from the life of a fisherman than the tearoom of a
Manhattan hotel, but Casey looks as if he just stepped off the
dock, his sleeves rolled up, his hair windblown, his face reddened
by the sun.
   The author's background seems more suitable to the yachting
circuit. Casey, born in 1939, is the son of Joseph Edward Casey, a
Democratic Congressman from Massachusetts in the 1930s and '40s. He
wrote poetry in high school and eventually graduated from Harvard
Law School.
   Research was unnecessary for ``Spartina.'' He started sailing as
a kid, racing boats at summer camp. He and his wife then purchased
a four-acre island in Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island, where Casey
lived _ and fished _ for four years.
   ``I thought I knew something when I got to Rhode Island,'' said
Casey, who has also written the novel ``An American Romance,'' and
a collection of stories, ``Testimony and Demeanor.''
   ``Boy, did I learn there was a lot more to it. After four years
there, I learned an awful lot of stuff,'' he said.
   ``It was the time of my life I was most integrated into the
place I lived. I had to work part time to make ends meet. I had
very little money, but it didn't matter. I caught fish every day. I
had a couple of lobster pots, and there were a lot of things to eat
almost all year round.''
   Casey writes love scenes like adventures at sea and adventures
at sea like love scenes. Dick's determination to build his own
fishing boat has strained relations with his wife, May, and he
eventually turns to Elsie Buttrick, a free-spirited rich-kid, for
support and affection.
   ``She took both his hands, and he floated to his feet,'' Casey
writes of the moment when Dick and Elsie begin their affair. ``He
bumped the corner of the table. When she touched his cheek, they
were clear of the table, in the center of the room.
   ``She said several things but he didn't take them in. He felt
weightless, but when their bones touched he felt their weight
against each other, as though they were small boats at sea rising
on the same swell, jostling, fendered by their flesh.
   ``He had one complete sting of conscience when they drifted
apart for an instant. Elsie shoved aside the red curtain and they
floated through.''
   When Dick finally finishes his boat, he stubbornly launches
Spartina despite an oncoming hurricane. He is no longer floating.
With the ship being thrown in the air like a parent tossing his
child, Casey describes a man staggering on deck, his only
fortiication a can of Coke and a thermos of coffee:
   ``As he stood back up, Spartina suddenly slid forward as though
she were greased. She stuck her nose into a wave. He felt her head
held down, caught, then lifted up by the bow and spun sideways. He
leaned against the spokes of the wheel. No effect. She fell back on
her beam. He clung to the wheel post with one hand to keep from
falling over. For a long moment he had no idea where she was or
which way was up.''
   Casey landed quite smoothly. ``Spartina'' won the National Book
Award in 1989, the same year his brother-in-law, Dr. Harold E.
Varmus, shared the Nobel Prize in medicine. A professor of English
literature at the University of Virginia, he now lives in
Charlottesville, Va., with his second wife, Pinchot Pittman, an
artist and calligrapher.
   And ``Spartina'' is just the first novel of a trilogy, Casey
promises, with other characters telling their stories and the
author giving them the chance as well to show their natural grace
through the worst of times.
   ``I knew I wanted Dick to become a better person through his
troubles,'' Casey said. ``There was a flowering of him. And Elsie,
too. She knows she needs to become better in some way. It's an
optimistic story in a way. Both of them become better even though
they've been bad.''

   In the first phase of her career, Carlene
Carter was caught in a deadening trap _ too rock 'n' roll for
country radio stations, and too country for rock listeners.
   This daughter of one of country music's most famous families
leaves no doubt where she stands now in her first album in seven
years.
   She brought in Heartbreaker Howie Epstein, retro-rocker Dave
Edmunds and former Band member Levon Helm to help her record _ an
album as country as her Tennessee home.
   ``I just did what came naturally and felt right to me and it
came out more country,'' said the 34-year-old Carter. ``I guess
I've just evolved as a writer and a performer a lot more and have
gotten a little older and wiser.''
   For anyone familiar with Carter's rocking side, the new ``I Fell
in Love'' comes as a bit of a shock. Fiddles and steel guitars
abound, and Carter doesn't hide her Tennessee accent on lines such
as, ``You burned me up like a chicken in a barbecue.''
   Carter was more of a stranger to the country crowd during the
late 1970s and early '80s. The daughter of June Carter Cash and
stepdaughter of Johnny Cash moved to London for eight years,
married English rock star Nick Lowe and ``was pretty wild and
crazy,'' she said.
   Her wedding to Lowe was immortalized in the video to Lowe's hit,
``Cruel to Be Kind'' and can still occasionally be seen on
late-night MTV. No video chronicled the divorce, however.
   Carter recorded five albums but none made her a star. ``Musical
Shapes,'' with Carter backed by her husband's former band,
Rockpile, was a favorite to the few who heard it and presaged
country music's more extensive flirtations with rock 'n' roll.
   But with the 1983 release of ``C'est Ce Bon,'' a
synthesizer-tinged album that even Carter disparages now, her
recording career went on hiatus. She turned briefly to musical
theater, performing in the London production of ``Pump Boys and
Dinettes.''
   ``I took a little time off and said I can't just make another
album without really knowing what I wanted to do,'' she said. ``You
can only get away with that for so long.''
   It was a phone call from her mother that changed her career.
   June Carter Cash and two of Carlene's aunts were performing in
London as the Carter family. One night, Carlene recalled, her Aunt
Anita took sick and the Carters needed an emergency fill-in. At
first, Carlene protested she didn't know the songs, but then did
her family duty.
   She loved it. The songs she thought she didn't know were burned
into her memory from family singalongs. Carlene, who learned how to
play guitar and poker from her grandmother, Maybelle, soon found
herself touring as a backup singer in the Carter family band.
   ``It's something I never thought I would want to do after having
been a rebel for so long,'' she said. ``I didn't think I would want
to go back and be in a group with my mom. But it was fun singing
with them and fun remembering what it was like laughing and being a
kid.''
   She helped the Carter Family record an album, then turned to her
own career.
   She has nothing but praise for Epstein, who took a holiday from
Tom Petty's backup group to produce Carter.
   ``It was really his first album as a producer and I felt it was
my first album as a serious participant,'' she said.
   On past albums, she said, ``I had my mind on so many other
things I didn't really take a lot of time. My thought processes
were often scattered, and it came across on record sometimes. This
time I'm real focused and I think that comes across, too.''
   Carter plunders her own background for songs. Cuts on the new
album include the Carter Family's ``Dixie Darling,'' ``You Are the
One,'' a hit for her father, Carl Smith, and ``Easy From Now On,''
one of the first songs Carter ever wrote that was once featured on
an Emmylou Harris record.
   Carter has no regrets about her rock 'n' roll days and doesn't
feel they discredited her family tradition.
   ``I was doing something that I believed was right at the time,''
she said. ``There's nothing written in stone that if you do one
kind of music one day that you can't do another kind of music
another day. I was experimenting. I was doing what they had taught
me growing up to do _ to be yourself and to be comfortable with
yourself.''
   Her marriage to Lowe over, Carter has moved into the house in
which she grew up in Madison, Tenn.
   The woman who once couldn't turn down a party invitation crawls
into her pajamas at 11 p.m. and gets ``real excited when I see they
have Spectravision in my hotel room.''
   She's rehearsing with a new band for a touring show that will
draw heavily from ``Musical Shapes'' and ``I Fell in Love.''
   ``I'm country through and through but some people might think
it's more rock 'n' roll,'' she said. ``I really don't care what
they think.''

   Colon Theater, the world-renowned
opera house, is back in business after a renovation and then labor
disputes kept its stage almost bare for two seasons.
   When the curtain belatedly went up on ``Faust'' in mid-July,
moviemaker and Colon director Sergio Renan said with relief, ``It
was a kind of compensation for a lot of headaches.''
   The modernization of the lighting system, repair of the machine
that rotates the sets, and other renovations were stretched out by
Argentina's recession and inflation that nearly reached 5,000
percent in 1989. A short-lived production of ``Aida'' was performed
last year in between repairs.
   The fall season normally begins in April. However, 1990
subscriptions initially were refunded and ``Faust'' was pushed
back. As the July 19 opening date drew near, opera and dance lovers
wondered if the 82-year-old theater would be ready in time.
   With special effects such as lightning and billowing smoke, the
opera also gave the Colon a chance to show off its improvements,
including a computer-controlled system to move sets up, down and
sideways; quickly and quietly.

   The stock market tumbled and oil prices climbed
as belligerent rhetoric by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein unnerved
investors and heightened fears of an oil shortage.
   The stock market closed the week with its worst performance
since Monday as virtually all sectors except gold and oil were
battered by tensions in the Middle East.
   Hussein's call for a ``holy war'' against Western forces and the
planned dispatch of Arab troops to Saudi Arabia created fears of
further disruptions of oil supplies from the Middle East, a
critical source of world fuel.

   Wholesale prices declined 0.1 percent in July,
the government said. The report showed inflation was in check
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week sent oil costs spiraling.
   The seasonally adjusted decline capped a six-month stretch of
virtually no change in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index
for finished goods. The index had risen a modest 0.2 percent in
June, the department said Friday.
   For the first seven months of the year, wholesale prices
advanced at an annual rate of 3 percent, down sharply from the 4.8
percent increase for all of last year.

   Stock prices nose-dived following the cancellation
today of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's planned trip to the Middle
East because of the Persian Gulf crisis. The dollar firmed against
the Japanese yen.
   The dollar, normally considered a safe haven in time of
international crisis, closed at 150.65 yen, up 0.90 yen from Friday.
   The dollar has gained 4.00 yen since Iraq's invaions of Kuwait
on Aug. 2.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues plummeted
1,153.12 points, or 4.22 percent, to 26,176.43. The index had shed
286.18 points Friday.
   The Nikkei, already weaker due to higher interest rates, has
percent since Aug. 1, when it closed at 30,837.99.
   Oil prices rose to above late Friday levels in New York. North
Sea Brent crude oil for October delivery was valued at $25.20 a
barrel as of 4 p.m. local time, up from Friday's close of $23.70.
   Earlier in the day, the government said Kaifu postponed his trip
because he was needed in Tokyo to coordinate Middle East policy.
His 12-day visit, scheduled before the current crisis erupted, was
to take him beginning Wednesday to Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Oman,
Jordan and Egypt.
   Following the announcement, the Nikkei index collapsed, traders
said. The closing rate was the lowest since April 1, 1988, when the
index finished at 26,104.22.
   ``Uncertainty prevaied, while activity was slow with only 250
million shares traded,'' said Yoshiro Inoue of Nomura Securities.
Trading was light because this week is a traditional Japanese
holiday.

<HEAD>USDA Cancels Public Calendar of Senior Officials' Schedules</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bureaucratic ooze has engulfed a popular daily
calendar that for many years has informed the public where senior
officials at the Agriculture Department spend their time and with
whom.
   The daily schedules of Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and
his top aides were last published on July 19. Efforts by news
organizations that regularly cover USDA to have them reinstated
have been denied.
   ``There's no requirement for us to produce a calendar such as
that,'' said Kelly Shipp, director of the department's Office of
Public Affairs. ``If you want to know who is meeting with whom,
you're more than welcome'' to file under the Freedom of Information
Act.
   Long before the FOIA, the creaky old department was something of
a model of openness. Glasnost, which made its mark in the Kremlin,
was old hat in USDA.
   Of course there were and are secrets. You are in peril of life
and limb if an attempt is made to crack the ``lockup room'' where
crop reports are prepared. And television monitors keep track of
visitors hanging around the secretary's office.
   Speaking of which, the USDA secretary's glass-walled outer
office once was shrouded from the inside by heavy drapes so
passersby couldn't identify visitors by sight.
   The drapes came down during the Nixon years so reporters and
anyone else could see inside. Sometimes you could even go into the
``bird cage'' outer office and read a magazine or two while keeping
an eye out for agricultural celebrities.
   But gradually there was a tightening of the rules. The old USDA,
referred to as ``peculiarly the people's department'' by creator
Abraham Lincoln, became perceptibly stuffier and harder to
penetrate because of the security.
   Tourists once were freely able to traipse in from the rounds of
the nearby museums and art galleries and get free USDA brochures
and booklets on virtually every subject. Fees are charged now, and
the booklets have to be ordered from some place out West.
   So the elimination of the daily postings of schedules is only a
small part of the changes that have occurred.
   The public versions of the daily schedules of USDA officials
underwent editing to delete certain sensitive appointments from the
calendars, a practice that went back through at least several
administrations.
   Shipp, who was Yeutter's press secretary before taking over the
top public affairs post recently, is still his chief spokeswoman.
   In an interview with The Associated Press and United Press
International, Shipp said the canceling of the daily appointments
calendar was an internal matter and ``you're just making too much
out of it.'' She said Yeutter did not make the decision to cancel.
   ``It was a decision made at a lower level,'' she said. ``I'm not
even sure he's aware of the decision. It was not a press (office)
decision. It was not Kelly Shipp.''
   The daily calendar was canceled for three basic reasons, Shipp
said. It was not accurate, she said, and there are difficulties
switching to a new computer system. Another reason is security.
   Daily schedules were floated all over Washington, allowing
lobbyists, market speculators, foreign interests and intelligence
gatherers of all sorts to note the comings and goings at USDA.

   The nation's total 1991 meat output is
expected to increase about 3 percent from this year's level,
according to Agriculture Department projections.
   Red meat, mostly beef and pork, is forecast to increase in 1991
after two years of decline, the department's Economic Research
Service said in last week's monthly supply-and-demand report.
   Beef production may increase slightly next year, most likely
from fed cattle going to market. Non-fed beef output may drop a bit
in 1991.
   ``Prices in 1991 probably will average the same to a little
above the 1990 level,'' the report said. ``Beef imports are
forecast to increase slightly in 1991, and exports will likely show
another gain.''
   Looking at pork, higher hog prices are expected to trigger a 3
percent increase in 1991 production.
   ``Prices will weaken under the increased output and for all of
1991 average a few dollars below this year's expected level,'' the
report said. ``Pork imports in 1991 are expected to increase
modestly, and exports likely will remain near the anticipated 1990
level.''
   Broiler producers may boost 1991 production by about 5 percent,
despite lower prices, the report said.
   ``The 1991 average price is expected to be near to slightly
below 1990's level,'' it said. ``Broiler meat exports in 1990 have
been boosted by sales to the Soviet Union and, if these sales
continue in 1991, exports likely will remain at this year's level.''

   Domestic cookies are costing more in Taiwan
these days, so the Asian nation is looking toward imports.
   An Agriculture Department report in the August issue of Foreign
Agriculture magazine says cookie and cracker importers are hopeful
they can profit from the situation.
   In the past, the report said, imports of cookies and crackers
were minimal because of high tariffs and ineffective marketing
strategy.
   ``With the tariff now reduced to 35 percent and recent increased
(domestic) production costs, imports of cookies and crackers are on
the rise,'' the report said.
   But if U.S. manufacturers want to get into the growing market,
they'll have plenty of competition from South Korea, Japan and Hong
Kong, the report indicated.

<TEXT>
   The Middle East crisis helped drive up
gasoline prices at the pump by more than a dime a gallon over the
last three weeks, an oil analyst says.
   The nationwide Lundberg Survey of about 13,000 stations found
the average price for all grades of gasoline, including taxes, was
$1.27.94 a gallon on Friday, up 10.2 cents from July 20.
   Analyst Trilby Lundberg on Sunday said that U.S. oil companies
have been forced to pay inflated prices for oil and gasoline on the
short-term spot market to meet consumer demand during the summer
driving months.
   ``The refiners are more susceptible to what's happening in the
Middle East now than at any other time,'' she said.
   Refiners also raised their wholesale prices quickly to prevent
panic buying that would leave them unable to fill customer orders,
she said.
   There was a bright spot for consumers: Dealers failed to pass on
the full cost of wholesale price increases to their customers.
Between July 20 and Aug. 10 their profit margins shrank by 0.8
cents a gallon, Ms. Lundberg said.

<TEXT>
   Despite Iraqi claims to the contrary, the
Iraq economy is weak and ill-prepared to withstand an economic
blockade, the Middle East Economic Survey reported today.
   ``Iraq's financial position was precarious before the invasion
and the ending of new hard currency flows will impose severe
strains on the Iraqi economy very rapidly,'' said the respected
weekly newsletter based in Nicosia.
   The newsletter disclosed that payments for Iraqi crude delivered
even before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait are being frozen.
Payment is normally made by 30-day letters of credit.
   Iraq's economy depends almost entirely on oil. And the three
outlets for Iraqi oil exports, pipelines across Turkey and Saudi
Arabia, and shipment by sea direct from an Iraqi terminal at the
head of the Gulf, have been blocked.
   The blocking of oil exports is part of a total trade embargo
decreed by a U.N. Security Council resolution after Iraq invaded
and then annexed Kuwait.
   ``Drawing together the available economic indicators, the clear
indication is that the Iraqi economy has been deteriorating during
the last year,'' the newsletter said.
   Iraq was becoming more dependent on outside funding after an
expensive eight-year war with Iran. In the second half of 1989, a
large increase was reported in short-term debt to Western
industrialized countries.
   Also, last year cash aid to Iraq from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,
estimated at $2 billion a year during the war _ which ended in a
cease-fire in 1988 _ stopped.
   In 1989, Iraq had trouble borrowing from commercial banks,
according to newsletter. Of a total of $1.6 billion in loans, $1.5
billion was in unauthorized loans from the Atlanta, Ga. branch of
the Italian Banca Nazionale del Lavoro.
   The Middle East Economic survey said it is unlikely that Iraq,
even before the embargo, could have found significant untapped
sources of new money.
   ``It is clear that at the present time the Iraqi economy is very
vulnerable and that it has little leeway to withstand an economic
blockade,'' it said.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has claimed that Iraq can hold
out against the embargo if it conserves supplies.
   ``Iraq's national wealth is abundant. ... Our supplies of
essential needs and food stuffs is great,'' Saddam said in a
message broadcast Sunday on Baghdad television. ``Victory is on our
side and defeat is certain for the aggessors who have pinned all
their hopes to their economic sanctions and to their forces and
their useless fleets.''
   However, in the same speech he indicated a concern about
shortages. He asked Iraqi women not to hoard foodstuffs and to cut
back on consumption.

   A tanker carrying nearly 1
million barrels of Iraqi oil that docked here does not fall under
the trade embargo ordered by President Bush, the Coast Guard said.
   Mobil Oil Corp. accepted the oil at its Paulsboro Refinery on
Sunday, but payment for the oil was blocked by sanctions Bush
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, said refinery
spokeswoman Ida Walker.
   The embargo does not apply to the oil because the
Bahamian-registered tanker left Turkey before the Middle East
invasion, Ms. Walker said.
   Mobil contacted the Treasury Department for instructions and was
told to accept the oil and deposit the payment due Iraq into a
frozen account. She said she did not know how much the shipment
cost.
   The tanker Nausicaa was docked in this port located across the
Delaware River from Philadelphia. It carried the first Iraqi oil
shipment into the area since the embargo was imposed, said Coast
Guard Lt.j.g. Jonathan Burton.
   ``It was all bought before the thing started,'' he said.
   Until the embargo is lifted, Mobil will try to obtain extra oil
from the North Sea, Mexico or other Middle East nations, Ms. Walker
said.
   Before invading Kuwait, Iraq had been exporting 2.7 million
barrels of oil a day through two pipelines across Turkey and Saudi
Arabia and by ship through the Persian Gulf.

<HEAD>Unemployment At Highest Rate In 15 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's unemployment rate climbed to 10.1
percent in the second quarter of 1990, the highest figure in at
least 15 years, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported Monday.
   According to the bureau, about 165,000 Israelis older than 15,
or 10.1 percent of the country's work force, were jobless between
April and June.
   Among men, the unemployment rate was 8.7 percent, compared with
11.9 percent among women, the bureau said.
   According to Finance Ministry projections cited in the Jerusalem
Post Monday, unemployment rates will hover around 9 percent to 10
percent during the next five years.
   Goverment data show a steady increase in unemployment since
1975, when the jobless rate measured 3.1 percent.
   The mass immigration of Soviet Jews is expected to pose a major
problem for the job market. About 70,000 Soviet Jews have already
arrived, and the number is exected to climb to 150,000 by the end
of the year.

<HEAD>New Loans Approved, Despite Reports Of Dropping Credit Rating</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   India can repay all the foreign loans it
receives, the nation's top finance official said in an effort to
refute charges that commercial banks are having misgivings about
lending to the nation.
   ``There has been no scrambling for loans,'' Finance Secretary
Bimal Jalan said in an interview this weekend, adding that India is
not facing a credit crunch.
   ``As far as India is concerned, there is still a lot of
enthusiasm'' on the part of international financial institutions to
lend it money, he said.
   But experts say India's credit is in danger with commercial
banks and predict that borrowing will become more difficult as its
oil bills multiply. India spends $4 billion a year on oil, and
rising prices will strain India's finances even more.
   India was approved last week for $320 million in new commercial
loans, according to a Finance Ministry document. One loan, to the
state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Commission by a Japanese syndicate,
was previously reported to have fallen through.
   Jalan said India is paying off $1 billion in loans this year,
``and we are absolutely on schedule.'' He admitted, however, that
repayment terms were not as good as they once were. ``Two or three
years ago we were underborrowing, and we got the finest terms. We
are still getting terms as good as Indonesia and better than
China,'' he said.
   V.J. Ravishankar, a senior economist at the World Bank in New
Delhi, said so far India has not been rejected for a loan, but its
credit rating has fallen as it dipped deeply into its foreign
currency reserves to finance a balance of payments deficit.
   ``India has never had any problems. But the situation is
changing,'' Ravishankar said. Bankers are worried about its low
foreign currency reserves and the increase in short-term loans, he
said.
   A diplomatic source who closely monitors India's finances agreed
the drop in reserves to about $2 billion _ enough to cover one
month's imports _ worried the banks.
   Jalan said India's external debt grew to $44 billion as the
government borrowed to bankroll major projects. World Bank figures
said the external debt was actually about $65 billion as of last
March. The larger figure included $9 billion in foreign currency
deposits by Indians living abroad and loans from the International
Monetary Fund.
   On the positive side, Jalan said exports are growing at about 18
percent aa year and ``keeping pace with imports. India's foreign
debt is 17.8 percent of the gross domestic product, which he said
is manageable.
   The debt service ratio, or the percentage of exports needed to
repay loans, declined to 21.6 percent, one of the lowest ratios in
the developing world, and is still falling, he said.

<HEAD>GM Strike Continues, Could Idle 40,000 This Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A six-day strike at a General Motors Corp. parts
plant has idled three assembly plant and could force the layoff of
40,000 autoworkers by midweek, the company says.
   Bargainers for United Auto Workers union Local 659 and the AC
Rochester Flint West plant began meeting Sunday afternoon and
continued talks into the night.
   The plant makes 65 percent of the fuel tanks for GM cars and
trucks as well as other parts including engine valves, van doors
and grilles for vans and pickup trucks.
   ``The workers attitudes are excellent and they are positive,''
union spokesman Larry Sills said Sunday.
   Among the plants that could close as early as today are GM's
luxury car plant in Oakland Orion Township and the Pontiac East
plant in Pontiac, GM said.
   GM officials were forced to close truck assembly plants in
Pontiac, Moraine, Ohio, and Shreveport, La., last week due to parts
shortages, idling 7,400 workers in all.
   Parts shortages brought on by the strike by 2,700 workers, which
began Wednesday over health and safety issues and line speedups,
also threaten production at the Buick City complex and the Truck &amp;
Bus Group assembly plant in Flint.
   Also threatened with layoffs are GM plants in Baltimore, Md.;
Fort Wayne, Ind.; Wentzville, Mo.; and Oshawa, Ontario.
   The strike also could force shutdowns inside GM's vast network
of component plants. For example, workers at the AC Rochester East
plant in Flint, where pumps used in GM fuel tanks are made, were
sent home Friday.
   In all, the strike could idle more than 40,000 GM workers by
midweek unless the dispute is settled.
   One UAW insider, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
bargainers have made little progress in the past few days. ``We're
just not getting anywhere,'' he said.
   UAW Vice President Stan Marshall has called the strike a signal
to GM that union officials are frustrated with the drain on jobs
due to outsourcing _ contracting for parts from sources outside GM.
   The UAW's national contracts expires Sept. 14.

   Stock prices fell sharply in early trading today
as the market remained jittery over the tension in the Middle East
and the resulting jump in oil prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 24.25 to
2,692.33 in the first half hour of trading.
   In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancing
ones by more than 4 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 195
up, 859 down and 387 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 20.99 million
shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts expected the market to continue its downward path from
Friday, when the Dow plunged 42.33 points.
   Concern about the Mideast prompted investors to dump stocks in
favor of safer investments, such as U.S. Treasury securities and
precious metals, analysts said.
   Analysts expect the rise in oil prices to put pressure on
corporate profits. Before the Mideast shock, experts were looking
for profits to improve in the second half of the year.
   The domestic market didn't get any help from abroad. The key
index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei, posted its
fourth-largest percentage drop ever today, while share prices also
were down in Europe.
   Among actively traded blue-chip issues today, Boeing fell 1 to

Motors fell | to 38~.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common shares was

   On Friday, volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 145.34

   Donald Trump may have to reveal some
details of his financial bailout if the Casino Control Commission
rules the public has the right to the documents.
   Trump has requested that some of the 1,000 pages of documents
remain secret because they hold sensitive financial information and
business plans. The commission, in hearings scheduled to begin this
afternoon, will decide which documents will be released. The
material outlines a $65 million bank loan made to Trump in June.
   The loan was designed to avoid a default on bonds issued to
support the Trump Castle Casino Resort By The Bay, one of three
Atlantic City casinos owned by the Manhattan developer.
   The commission ruled last week that all the documents could be
released, appellate judge delayed the order. The appellate division
ruled Trump should present the commission with specific requests
for what should not be released.
   Trump's attorneys say release of the more sensitive details
could jeopardize future negotiations on restructuring the $1
billion in debt used to finance his three casinos. The commission
is scheduled to hold a hearing Thursday on the merits of the
restructuring plan.
   In other developments, news reports said Trump will hire First
Boston Corp. to handle the restructuring, replacing Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co.

<HEAD>Number of Working Rigs Jumps by 26</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and natural gas rigs in
the United States rose for the first time in three weeks, jumping
by 26 this week to 992, Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   In the two previous weeks, the count had dropped by a combined
56 rigs. A year ago this week, the count was 858.
   Ike Kerridge, a vice president at Baker Hughes who keeps track
of the count, said the increase ``may well be'' the start of a
resurgence sparked by the Iraqi oil embargo.
   ``If this isn't the increase, I would certainly expect it
shortly,'' Kerridge said.
   But he noted most of the fluctuation came from Texas, which last
week dropped 16 rigs and this week gained 14. Kerridge said many of
those rigs may have been moving to other locations in South Texas,
the predominant site of a surge in horizontal drilling in the past
year.
   Kerridge said he expected the count to continue increasing
throughout the remainder of the year from seasonal fluctuations
alone.
   The Houston-based oil toolmaker company has kept track of the
rig count _ the widely watched index of drilling activity _ since
1940.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Among major oil-producing states, Texas gained 14 rigs for the
week, after losing 16 last week. Other states with gains for the
week included California, which added six, and Louisiana and
Pennsylvania, which each added three.
   States reporting rig declines for the week include North Dakota,
down three; Ohio and Michigan, each of which dropped by two; and
Wyoming, which lost one rig.
   Other states including Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico and Oklahoma
reported their rig counts were unchanged for the week.

<HEAD>U.S. Should Have Oil Reserves Ready to Go, Petroleum Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States should be prepared to tap its
strategic crude oil reserve in case the boycott of Iraqi and
Kuwaiti oil creates an insurmountable shortage, the head of an
industry group said today.
   President Bush ``should give very serious consideration to
releasing that oil,'' said Charles J. DiBona, president of the
American Petroleum Institute. ``There is no immediate pressure to
do that, but that could change and we should be prepared to do
that.''
   The White House said late last week that it had no plans to open
the nation's strategic petroleum reserve, a vast quantity of crude
stockpiled in response to the Arab embargo oil shocks of the 1970s.
   The reserve is stored in underground salt caverns in Louisiana
and is said to contain several hundred days' worth of emergency
supplies.
   Oil prices climbed again this morning because of the uncertainty
in the Middle East. The price of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, rose 47 cents a barrel to $26.70 by late
morning on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil fetched $21 a
barrel just before Iraq seized Kuwait Aug. 2.
   It might take a few weeks for the government to gear up to
auction the oil held in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, so
preparations for opening the reserve should be made now to avoid
any delays, DiBona said. The turmoil in the world oil markets
caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait ``is clearly the kind of
circumstance for which the oil reserve was designed,'' DiBona said.
   He told a news conference that the immediate fate of the oil
supply will hinge on the willingness of foreign producers to make
up nearly 4 million barrels per day that had been exported by Iraq
and Kuwait.
   ``Saudi Arabia, a key gulf producer, has indicated a willingness
to help,'' DiBona said. ``So has Venezuela. And to the extent they
do, they will largely make up the 4 million barrel per day
shortfall. However, no one can know at this point what the net
effect on world oil supplies will be.''
   DiBona said there are other steps the United States can take to
lessen the effects of the higher prices.
   He called on the government to open the Point Arguello oilfield
off the coast of California, which he said is sitting idle because
California officials have not given oil companies permission to
deliver their oil. The field could immediately produce 90,000
barrels per day, DiBona said.
   Consumers could ease the crisis by conserving the oil they use
and by resisting the temptation to top off their tanks or hoard
supplies, although conservation will not be enough to solve the
problem, DiBona said.
   Asked about complaints from consumers that oil companies have
been unfairly raising prices, DiBona reiterated the industry's view
that the companies have shown restraint. Retail prices of gasoline
have not risen nearly as high as spot market prices or wholesale
prices, he said.
   ``The petroleum industry has not taken advantage of this
international crisis in a self-serving way,'' DiBona said. DiBona
declined to predict what will happen to prices in the future.
   Increased domestic production could also alleviate the oil
crisis, DiBona said, but oil companies base their plans for more
exploration on their projections of prices over a long term. The
prices have been changing too rapidly in recent days to permit any
such long-term planning, DiBona said.

   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. Chairman Edward Brennan was
given an ultimatum by the board of directors last week to either
shape up the company's sagging retail operations or ship out,
Crain's Chicago Business reported today.
   Sears categorically denied the report.
   Crain's, attributing the report to unidentified board members,
said Brennan was told at a directors' meeting last Wednesday that
he has six months to achieve marked improvement in retail profits.
   The company did announce after that meeting that Brennan demoted
the head of the Merchandise Group and took on those
responsibilities himself.
   At the time, Sears said Michael Bozic was removed as president
of the Merchandise Group because he wasn't moving fast enough to
implement changes already under way.
   But Crain's said there was more to Bozic's removal than met the
eye.
   ``You say you can turn this around _ then do it yourself,'' a
director told Brennan, according to the Crain's account.
   Sears spokesman Gerald F. Buldack denied there was any truth to
the Crain's report.
   ``It's absolutely false and misleading,'' Buldack said. He
declined to answer specific questions about the report.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were modestly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, partly
reflecting profit-taking after last week's gains in corn, soybeans
and oats.
   Analysts also linked early losses in the corn and soybean
markets to forecasts for more good growing weather in the Midwest.
   A National Weather Service six-to-10-day outlook issued Friday
predicts mild temperatures and above-normal rainfall for the
Midwest for the five-day period beginning Thursday.
   Traders will get an update on the condition of the corn and
soybean crops when the Agriculture Department releases its weekly
crop progress report after today's close.
   Wheat futures were pressured in early trading by perceptions the
United States is becoming less competitive on the world wheat
market because of an increased global supply of the grain.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 2{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.79 a bushel; corn
futures were unchanged to 2 cents lower with September at $2.48\ a
bushel; oats were { cent to 1\ cents lower with September at $1.18\
a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 4 cents lower with August at
$6.06{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .20 cent higher with August
at 79.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .38 cent to .50 cent
higher with August at 89.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent
lower to .58 cent higher with August at 58.35 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .25 cent lower to .63 cent higher with August at
48.25 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mostly lower on Friday; pork futures were

   Investors said the trading day opened amid fears that the

   Gold prices soared Monday with some buying from
Middle East sources worried that Iraq's occupation could flare up
into a broader conflict involving Western forces.
   The U.S. dollar fell sharply against major foreign currencies,
reflecting growing concern about the fundamental strength of the

yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8842 from $1.8730 late

significant flare up in the Gulf during the day.
   He that the lack of a major development encouraged speculative

otherwise be inclined to given uncertainties over Gulf developments.
   Dealers said the costs of maintaining U.S. troops in the Middle
East is high, and that is apt to undermine efforts in Washington to
reduce the budget deficit.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $5.15 a
troy ounce, up from $4.95 bid late Friday.

   Much of the immediate reactions in securities
markets after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was based on fears of an
oil shortage and a runup in the price of fuel, as in 1973 and 1979.
   But much has changed since then, a good deal of it, though not
all, for the better.
   Some of the conservation program has been junked, for example,
but it has left a legacy of better insulated houses, more efficient
combustion engines, and less reliance on oil. And parts of the
program can be resurrected.
   The political situation has changed.
   Back then, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Nations was
united in efforts to raise prices. And the world powers were still
antagonistic toward each other's plans, whatever they were.
   Today, much of the Arab world opposes Iraq's actions, and the
world's powers seem more accommodating to each other's hopes for
the future. OPEC seems willing to allow production to rise.
Stability is another widely shared goal.
   Oil reserves of the Western world and Japan today are massively
higher than before. The United States has close to a billion
barrels in strategic and commercial oil stocks. Relative to usage,
Japan may have more.
   Meanwhile, the lesson of the 1970s was not entirely wasted.
Philadelphia Electric now relies heavily on nuclear power,
generating less than 5 percent of its electricty from oil. New
England electric has cut its reliance in half.
   The economic situation has changed.
   In the 1970s the U.S. economy was effectively out of control,
with prices and interest rates high or rising. As a result, the
Federal Reserve tightened its monetary policy, hoping to slow the
economy.
   In 1990, the economy has many weak spots _ debt, for instance _
that pose more critical dangers than a temporary increase in the
price of oil. The economy as a whole is under a tight-fisted
monetary policy.
   Moreover, when the Fed pushed up short-term interest rates in
the earlier crises it precipitated recessions, the second one
considered to be among the worst of the century. It isn't likely to
commit that error again.
   While a prolonged shortage of oil or extreme prices could be
debilitating to the American economy, that prospect is not nearly
so high today as it was in the 1970s, when major oil producing
countries were united in their stand.
   A short-term cut in the flow of oil from abroad still would
affect prices, but perhaps to a smaller degree than many people
fear. In the absence of panic, says economist Roger Brinner, a
$2-a-barrel rise seems likely in 1991.
   By his calculations for DRI-McGraw-Hill, an important provider
of economic data to the private sector, this would imply a 5
percent gain in the average wholesale price of all fuel and power.
   While that $2-a-barrel increase would be close to 10 percent, he
reasons that the significant roles of nuclear, hydro and coal
generation would dilute the effect on delivered prices.
   The consumer impact would be even less, he says. Because
household spending on energy is 5.5 percent of all consumer
purchases, ``the direct inflation impact is about a quarter of a
percentage point (5 percent of 5.5 percent).''
   The spillover from other product and labor markets could add to
this impact. Brinner believes it might mean a total price bulge of
0.5 percent, ``but not to any material, sustained increase in the
rate of inflation.''
   A more optimistic scenario than many would paint, of course. And
it never should be forgotten that economic projections have a
tendency to be revised when confronted with reality.

   An electrical blackout disrupted New York's
financial district today, halting the operations of many investment
companies and the trading of some stocks and commodities.
   The American Stock Exchange, New York Mercantile Exchange and
other New York commodities futures exchanges suspended trading for
the rest of the day following the early afternoon power failure.
   Many financial brokers and dealers had to curtail or suspend
operations and others simply told workers in the affected area to
leave for the day after power failed at about 1:15 p.m.
   ``Except for a skeleton crew, everybody's heading home,'' said
Steven Faigen, spokesman for Shearson Lehman Brothers, one of the
biggest Wall Street investment firms.
   Shearson and other major brokerages still kept traders on the
floor of the New York Stock Exchange, which was unaffected by the
power outage. But the volume of trading slowed.
   A substation fire caused the outage, which affected much of
southern Manhattan's Wall Street area, the World Trade Center and
World Financial Center, headquarters of many of the nation's
biggest financial businesses. Con Edison, New York's electrical
utility, said it wouldn't restore power for hours.
   The outage also briefly disrupted operations at Dow Jones, which
publishes the Wall Street Journal and operates a financial news
wire service. Spokesman James Ambrosio said the news wire stopped
for about 30 minutes and the company was operating on emergency
backup power.
   The fire at Con Ed's Seaport substation began shortly after
noon, said utility spokesman Dan Walden.
   ``It knocked out some high voltage cables serving the area,''
Walden said, initially affecting 500 customers. Two other feeder
cables became overloaded and were also knocked out, causing the
blackout to spread.
   ``I can't say for sure how many now. But it's going to be
substantially more than 500,'' Walden said.
   Concern that continued electrical usage by other customers would
overload feeder cables and knock out additional networks, prompted
Con Ed to issue an emergency plea for immediate cutbacks.
   ``It's imperative that other customers cooperate,'' Walden said.
   The cause of the fire, which was not under control more than an
hour after it began, was not immediately known. The fire also
affected some subway service in the area, the Transit Authority
said.

   Stock prices were mixed today as the market
remained jittery over tension in the Middle East and the jump in
oil prices. Trading was reduced by a power outage that halted
operations on several exchanges.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 4.21 points
at 2,720.79 as of 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Earlier, it was down by as
much as 32 points.
   But in the broader market, declining issues outnumbered
advancing ones by about 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange, with
573 up, 868 down and 495 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 99.15 million
shares as of 3 p.m.
   Trading on the American Stock Exchange, the New York Mercantile
Exchange and the Commodity Exchange was cut off shortly after 1
p.m. EDT after a fire caused a power outage in Manhattan's
financial district. The exchanges were forced to halt trading for
the rest of the day.
   The NYSE was not affected by the outage, but some brokerage
houses said their operations were curtailed.
   Analysts expected the stock market to continue its downward path
from Friday, when the Dow plunged 42.33 points. Concern about the
Mideast prompted investors to dump stocks in favor of safer
investments, such as U.S. Treasury securities and precious metals,
analysts said.
   Economists expect the rise in oil prices to depress the economy
and put pressure on corporate profits. Before the Mideast shock,
experts were looking for profits to improve in the second half of
the year.
   The domestic market didn't get any help from abroad today. The
key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei, posted its
fourth-largest percentage drop ever due to concern about the
Mideast, while share prices also finished lower on London's Stock
Exchange.
   Among actively traded blue-chip issues today, Boeing fell &rsqb; to
52|, Philip Morris was unchanged at 45~, IBM was up 1\ at 103\ and
General Electric fell &lsqb; to 66{.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common shares rose
0.24 at 184.39. The American Stock Exchange market value index was
unavailable due to the interruption of trading.

   Eastern Airlines announced reduced fares Monday,
and gave travelers about two weeks to buy tickets before a
fuel-related fare increase takes effect.
   The one-way fares, ranging from $69 to $139, cover all of
Eastern's 62 U.S. destinations from Sept. 5 to Dec. 16, but the
tickets must be purchased by Aug. 29, the Miami-based company said.
   Eastern, along with several other airlines, plans to hike fares
by 5.3 percent this week because of higher fuel costs following the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   But Eastern said it decided to offer the reduced fares to
increase business during the slower fall season.
   A Saturday night overnight stay is required to qualify for the
lower fares, which are available all days but Nov. 21 and Nov.
25-26, said senior vice president for marketing George Brennan.
   Some of the fares include: Miami-New York, $79; New York-Los
Angeles, $139; and Atlanta-Boston, $79.

   Stock prices rose today though the market
remained jittery over tension in the Middle East and the jump in
oil prices. Trading was reduced by a power outage that halted
operations at several exchanges.
   ``We're having a very light-volume rally,'' said Dudley Eppel, a
managing director at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   He said the market had reached an ``oversold'' state and
investors began buying issues again. In addition, prices were
boosted late in the session by computer-driven buying tied to the
futures market.
   ``In the light-volume days the computer controls the tape. It
takes it right out of our hands,'' he said of the program trading.
   The rally was a surprise given the market's slump early in the
session, Eppel said. The Dow Jones industrial average was down by
as much as 32 points in the opening hour.
   Trading on the American Stock Exchange, the New York Mercantile
Exchange and the Commodity Exchange was cut off shortly after 1

   Grain and soybean futures retreated Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, partly in reaction to improved growing
conditions for the southern soybean crop.
   Rain fell Monday in the Mississippi Delta region, where
drier-than-normal conditions had raised concerns about the soybean
crop.
   Weather forecasters predicted a continuation of beneficial crop
weather in the Midwest, where the bulk of U.S. corn and soybeans
are grown.
   The broad-based decline also reflected disappointment in the
market's generally weak response last week to a government crop
report that projected lower 1990 U.S. corn and soybean production
than traders had expected.
   ``There were some discouraged sellers today,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain trading
division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat futures settled 3 cents to 7{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $2.75\ a bushel; corn was 2
cents to 5 cents lower with September at $2.45\ a bushel; oats were
3 cents to 3{ cents lower with September at $1.16 a bushel;
soybeans were 5{ cents to 14 cents lower with August at $6.03\ a

   Oil-producing countries are planning a new
meeting to discuss how they should handle oil shortages that have
resulted since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the Saudi ambassador said
Monday.
   ``There will be an OPEC meeting soon,'' Prince Bandar Bin Sultan
said at a briefing for reporters. He said members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are holding
``consultations'' in preparation for the meeting.
   Bandar provided scant details, refusing to say when and where
the OPEC meeting would be held. Earlier he said the Saudis would
like ``to have a stable and predictable market for oil.''
   The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2 _ and subsequent sanctions
against those countries _ have cut by 4 million barrels a day the
amount of oil available on the world markets.
   At the same time, oil prices have climbed because of the
uncertainty in the Middle East. The price of West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, rose 54 cents a barrel to
$26.77 Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, in trading that
halted early due to a power outage. Oil traded at about $21 a
barrel just before Iraq seized Kuwait.
   Charles DiBona, chairman of the American Petroleum Institute,
said Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have both indicated a willingness
to help ease shortages.
   At the most recent OPEC meeting, which concluded in Geneva,
Switzerland, July 27, the 13 OPEC ministers raised the target price
$3 to $21 a barrel. They also agreed not to puncture the production
ceiling of 22.5 million barrels a day until the end of the year.
   Just before the meeting, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had
threatened military action against countries that were
over-producing chronically, namely Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury

weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $9.2 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.41 percent, up from 7.23 percent

average discount rate of 7.31 percent, up from 7.19 percent last

   The rates were the highest since July 30 when three-month bills
sold for 7.50 percent and six-month bills averaged 7.37 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. said Monday there's no truth
to a published report that Chairman Edward Brennan was given six
months to revive the company's retail operation or risk losing his
job.
   The report in this week's edition of Crain's Chicago Business
quoted unidentified directors as saying the board is fed up with
Sears' decline as the nation's biggest general retailer.
   ``Brennan is on real thin ice, and he has a very short time
period,'' Crain's reported, quoting a source close to the company.
   ``He has taken over the helm of a ship that has a rotten bottom,
and he has been running around trying to patch up the holes with
tar, but he has too many gushers.''
   Brennan reportedly was given the ultimatum during a directors'
meeting last Wednesday.
   After the meeting the company announced the demotion of Michael
Bozic from head of the retail operation and said Brennan was taking
on those added responsibilities.
   But director Albert V. Casey, former chairman of AMR Corp., said
he attended Wednesday's meeting and there was no attack on Brennan.
   ``His job isn't in jeopardy at all,'' Casey said in a telephone
interview Monday. ``If we didn't have him, he's just the kind of
executive we'd be looking for.''
   Sears also denied that Brennan had been given an ultimatum.
   ``It's absolutely false and misleading,'' spokesman Gerald
Buldack said of the Crain's report. He declined to answer specific
questions about the story.
   Sears stock dropped 25 cents to $30.50 in Monday trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Before taking over the leadership of Sears, Brennan had been in
charge of its Merchandise Group and led it to its top earnings in
1984.
   But the company has struggled in recent years with rising costs,
stiff competition and a sluggish overall retail environment.
   Sears' retailing costs are the highest in the industry. Expenses
last year consumed 30 cents of every retail sales dollar, compared
with 23 cents at K mart Corp. and 16 cents at Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
   Net income produced by the Merchandise Group declined 32 percent
during the second quarter of this year.

   Bethlehem Steel Corp. said Monday it plans
to sell its railroad freight car division as part of an effort to
divest assets unrelated to its basic steel making operations.
   The division, which is located in Cambria County and employs
1,000 people, produces rail cars including coal gondolas and
haulers for truck trailers.
   The rail car division posted revenue of $120 million in 1989.
Bethlehem, the nation's second-largest steel maker, said the
division's earnings increased in the first six months of 1989
because more rail cars were shipped.
   USW Local 2635 President William Kramer in Johnstown said the
announcement was a surprise. He had no further comment. The sale
offer was announced to employees Monday morning.

   Gold prices climbed to five-month highs Monday
on concerns that Iraq's occupation of Kuwait could explode into war
involving Western forces, choke off the oil flow and batter the
economy.
   The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, slumped against major foreign
currencies, which are expected to strengthen as interest rates rise
overseas while rates fall here as monetary authorities try to keep
the economy out of a recession.
   Gold for current delivery was up $8.30 a troy ounce at $405.20
as trading was unexpectedly halted in the early afternoon on New
York's Commodity Exchange due to a power outage. The gain followed
a rise of $11.10 an ounce.
   The spot price for gold hasn't closed that high since early
March, traders said.
   In after-hours trading at Republic National Bank in New York,
gold was quoted at a $403.25 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $7 from
Friday's late bid.
   Dealers in New York said most of the gains in gold prices
occurred overnight in foreign markets and included reported
purchases by Mideast buyers.
   They said gold prices surged in the first hour in New York to
match the gains overseas but trading was subdued and featureless
for the rest of the day.
   ``The price rise reflected the continued crisis in the
Mideast,'' said Steven Pepper, bullion dealer for Republic National
Bank.
   He said investors buy gold in times of international political
turmoil, and the metal also affords protection against inflation
that is expected to result from the oil price surge that followed
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2.
   Gold rose $13.35 to $404.60 an ounce in London, and jumped to
$404 an ounce in Zurich from $390.50 late Friday. Earlier in Hong
Kong, gold rose $2.92 an ounce to close at $397.67.
   Silver for current delivery rose to $5.145 per troy ounce on the
Comex, up 17.6 cents from Friday's close. Silver rose to $5.15 a
troy ounce in London from $4.95 late Friday.
   In the currency markets, the dollar lost more ground against
major currencies on anticipation that U.S. interest rates will move
lower while rates overseas rise in coming days.
   The dollar has been under pressure in recent weeks because of
weakness in the U.S. economy, and many traders expect the Federal
Reserve will eventually move to lower interest rates in an effort
to stimulate the economy to keep it from a recession.
   But at the same time, traders expect rates will rise in Germany
and Japan as central banks there try to head off inflation due to
rising oil prices.
   The net effect would be to make the dollar less attractive for
foreign investors.
   ``The only thing supporting the dollar is the flight to
quality'' that is traditionally involved when international events
are in turmoil, said Karen Gibbs, a seniuor financial analyst for
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   ``The dollar is no longer perceived as quality _ it's the Swiss
franc, the D-mark and the Australian dollar,'' she said.
   In New York, the dollar fell to 150.25 Japanese yen from 150.40
yen late Friday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose to 150.65 yen
from 149.75 yen at Friday's close. In London, it fell to 150.35 yen.
   The dollar lost ground against the British pound. In New York,
the pound rose to $1.8825 from $1.8735 late Friday. In London,
sterling rose to $1.8842 from $1.8730 late Friday.
   Dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Friday,
included: 1.5780 German marks, down from 1.5895; 1.3165 Swiss
francs, down from 1.3375; 5.2925 French francs, down from 5.3325;
1,156.25 Italian lire, down from 1,165.00; and 1.14625 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.14705.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.5762 German marks, down from 1.5895; 1.3160
Swiss francs, down from 1.3400; 5.2915 French francs, down from
5.3360; 1.7753 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7925; 1,156.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,166.50; 1.1475 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1476.

<HEAD>Chase Manhattan Offers Severance to Longtime Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Longtime U.S. employees of Chase Manhattan Corp.
are being offered severance payments to leave their jobs early as
the nation's second-biggest banking company begins efforts to trim
costs by $300 million.
   The company made the offer last week to employees with at least
10 years service, a company spokesman who asked not to be
identified said Monday.
   He was unable to say how many of the company's 30,000 domestic
employees are eligible for the program, but estimated it is a few
thousand.
   Like other major banking companies, Chase has been under
pressure to cut costs because the commercial real estate market has
left lenders with increasing levels of problem loans.
   Chase expects to charge about $30 million against its
third-quarter earnings as a result of the voluntary program,
depending on how many employees take advantage of it. It expects to
save $10 million in the fourth quarter as a result of the program,
again depending on participation.
   The new separation program is only part of the company's plan to
trim costs, the Chase spokesman said. He said the program ``is a
way of giving added flexibility to the employees who have been with
us a long time.''
   Under the offer, employees who retire with at least 10 years
service would get two week's pay for every year of service and
those with at least 20 years would get three weeks' pay for every
year of service.
   The offer is open until Sept. 10.
   Chase told employees in June that it intends to trim $300
million in costs. That announcement came in the wake of a
management reorganization in which it named President Thomas G.
Labrecque to replace Willard C. Butcher as chairman and chief
executive officer effective Oct. 31.
   For the first six months of this year, Chase's profits have
fallen 64 percent to $96 million, or 44 cents a share.
   For the third quarter of 1989, Chase lost $1.11 billion, or
$12.45 a share, including $1.26 billion of special provisions, such
as adding to the bank's reserves for possible losses on loans to
countries refinancing their debts.

   An afternoon rally sent stock prices higher
Monday after a steep opening slump, but trading was reduced by a
power outage that curtailed operations at the American Stock
Exchange and several brokerages.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 30.20 to
2,746.78.
   But declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancing ones in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
726 up, 766 down and 479 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 122.82 million
shares, down from 145.34 million in Friday's session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 151.19 million shares.
   The market opened with a thud, with the Dow Jones average
plunging as much as 32 points in the first half hour.
   The drop followed steep losses overseas. The key index on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei, posted its fourth-largest
percentage drop ever due to concern about the Mideast. Share prices
also finished lower on London's Stock Exchange.
   But prices in New York began to pick up in the afternoon in a
``light-volume rally,'' said Dudley Eppel, a managing director at
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. He said the market
had reached an ``oversold'' state and investors resumed buying.
   Prices rose further late in the session in a bout of
computer-driven buying tied to the futures market.
   ``In the light-volume days the computer controls the tape. It
takes it right out of our hands,'' Eppel said of the program
trading.
   Trading on the American Stock Exchange, as well as on the New
York Mercantile Exchange and the Commodity Exchange, was cut off
shortly after 1 p.m. EDT after a fire knocked out power in
Manhattan's financial district. The exchanges were forced to halt
trading for the rest of the day.
   The NYSE was not affected by the outage, but many brokerage
houses said their operations were curtailed.
   Analysts had expected the stock market to continue its downward
path from Friday, when the Dow plunged 42.33 points. Concern about
the Mideast and the effect of rising oil prices on the economy
prompted investors to dump stocks in favor of safer investments,
analysts said.
   But the fact that conditions in the Mideast did not deteriorate
significantly in recent days may have helped spark Monday's rally,
Eppel said.
   Among most-active blue-chip stocks, IBM rose 1} to 103}, Eastman
Kodak jumped 2{ to 43{, Philip Morris was up | to 46{, and Boeing
was down &rsqb; to 52|.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market grew $20.877 billion, or 0.65
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.48 to 185.63.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock composite index rose 3.32 to 338.84.
S&amp;P's industrial index was unavailable due to the power outage.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.27 to 408.30. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index as of 1 p.m. EDT _ before the market was forced to close by
the power outage _ stood at 338.14, down 1.18.

<HEAD>Plants Prepare for Strike After Offer Rejected</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. closed coke ovens and blast
furnaces Monday as the ailing steel maker braced for a strike
Thursday by 5,500 union workers in Ohio, West Virginia and
Pennsylvania.
   The Wheeling, W.Va.-based company said it cut production after
the United Steelworkers rejected a contract that included a $3,000
signing bonus and a raise of $2 an hour in each of the next four
years.
   Workers at 13 USW locals last month authorized a strike
beginning just after midnight Wednesday.
   USW spokesman Dick Fontana said Monday the union had no comment
on the rejection of the offer.
   Resumption of talks wasn't scheduled this week, but
Wheeling-Pitt was trying to meet with the union before the strike
deadline, said company spokesman Ray Johnson.
   ``We'd certainly be willing to sit down with them to negotiate
further,'' he said.
   Wheeling-Pitt, the nation's 10th largest steel maker, operates
steel mills in Allenport, Washington County, Pa.; Beech Bottom,
Follansbee and Wheeling, W.Va.; and Steubenville, Mingo Junction,
Canfield, Martins Ferry and Yorkville, Ohio.
   The company sought protection from its creditors in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in 1985, and its reorganization has been one of
the nation's longest.
   Wheeling-Pitt said in a news release Monday that mills were
preparing to stop making and shipping steel ``to effect an orderly
shutdown in event of the walkout.''
   ``You don't just shut these operations down by pressing a
button,'' Johnson said. ``You have to gradually get them to a point
where you can shut them down.''
   Union officials have said they are angry about fees paid to
accountants and lawyers in Wheeling-Pitt's reorganization and
payment to union members of 13 cents on the dollar for stock,
compared to 74 cents on the dollar for creditors' claims.
   Wheeling-Pitt said its negotiators are concerned the USW kept
details of the rejected proposal from rank-and-file members. The
company said it would keep its doors open to employees who wanted
to work during a walkout.
   The company alleged a strike would violate federal labor laws
and accused the USW of repressive bargaining.
   Wheeling-Pitt Chairman William Scharffenberger told the
company's board of directors in July that a long strike would force
him to consider liquidating the company's assets and turning over
proceeds to creditors.
   The USW called Scharffenberger's announcement a bluff.

<HEAD>Creditors Relieved by Robert Campeau's Removal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Creditors overseeing the Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization of the Federated and Allied retailing companies were
relieved by the ouster of chairman Robert Campeau of Campeau Corp.,
a creditors' lawyer said Monday.
   Toronto-based Campeau Corp., which owns Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., announced Friday that the
66-year-old Canadian businessman who founded the company more than
40 years ago had been forced out as chairman and chief executive.
He remains as a company director, but his future role has not been
announced.
   ``We obviously hope that it would have some positive _ although
I doubt any immediate _ direct impact. His involvement has not had
any apparent effect on the administration of these cases,'' said
Lewis Rosenbloom, a lawyer representing Federated's unsecured
creditors.
   ``I think what's important is his removal reflects realization
by his board of directors and shareholders of the financial
destruction wrought by the administration of Federated and
Allied,'' Rosenbloom said.
   Campeau engineered the 1986 purchase of Allied and the 1988
buyout of Federated. The leveraged deals saddled Federated and
Allied with debt that prompted them to seek Chapter 11 protection
from creditors on Jan. 15 in Cincinnati.
   Federated and Allied, which listed $7.7 billion in debts, still
have not announced when they plan to file their formal plans for
emerging from reorganization. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug
Jr. of Cincinnati is overseeing their operations.
   Rosenbloom said the ouster reassured creditors because it
suggests Campeau will not attempt to involve himself in the
reorganization by claiming equity in the reorganized Federated and
Allied. Federated and Allied, both based in Cincinnati, operate 256
stores in 28 states and employ about 100,000 people.
   ``Our view was that any role he would play would be in the
ultimate reorganization of those companies, and that he would
potentially present an impediment to the reorganization process,''
Rosenbloom said.
   Rosenbloom said the creditors he represents want Federated and
Allied to survive _ not be liquidated _ because the two companies
have demonstrated historically that they are profitable.
   ``Our constituency believes that the return of the companies to
the marketplace as operating companies outside of Chapter 11 is
very, very important to the health of the companies,'' he said.
   Conrad Morgenstern, the U.S. trustee helping Aug administer the
Federated and Allied cases, said Robert Campeau's ouster should not
affect the reorganizations.
   Carol Sanger, a Campeau Corp. spokeswoman in Cincinnati, said
Federated and Allied have been remote from Robert Campeau since
January's Chapter 11 filings. ``Ultimately, I think it may prove to
be a good thing in that many of the creditors were urging that this
be done all along,'' Ms. Sanger said. ``It will have no direct
impact as far as we're concerned.''

<HEAD>Gold Soars With Oil Price, Inflation Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices soared in an abbreviated trading session
Monday on New York's Commodity Exchange, reflecting rising
inflation fears as oil prices continue to climb.
   On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures fell
sharply and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Trading on the New York commodity exchanges ended abruptly with
an electrical blackout early in the afternoon that affected much of
New York's Wall Street district.
   On the Commodity Exchange, trading halted with gold futures up
$7.20 to $11, with the contract for delivery in August at $405.20 a
troy ounce, the strongest finish for a spot gold contract since
March 1.
   Silver futures ended 17.1 cents to 20.9 cents higher with August
at $5.145 a troy ounce.
   Precious metals rose sharply for the third straight day as
surging oil prices kept inflation fears alive. Gold is considered a
good hedge against inflation.
   When trading ended on the New York Mercantile Exchange, West
Texas Intermediate crude oil futures were 43 cents to $1 higher
with September at $26.66 a barrel; heating oil was 1.48 cents to 3
cents higher with September at 75.05 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .65 cent to 3.45 cents higher with September at 82.90
cents a gallon.
   Strength in the oil markets was again linked to tensions in the
Persian Gulf, where a barricade of U.S. warships stood ready to
block all trade with Iraq.
   Iraq's conquest of Kuwait has been a powerful stimulant for
gold, which traded as low as $352 an ounce in early June. Some
analysts believe the market would fall just as sharply if the
Middle East situation suddenly cooled.
   But Stephen Gotwald, vice president of GoldCorp Australia, a
marketer of Australian precious metal coins, said Monday's rally
above $405 demonstrated ``some real confidence'' in gold that had
nothing to do with the Middle East.
   And as long as the United States remains a key player in the
Persian Gulf war, gold will find additional support there, he said.
   ``The deeper we go, the less likely that a reasonable solution
is going to be found any time soon,'' Gotwald said of the Middle
East situation.
   Grain and soybean futures tumbled on the Chicago Board of Trade,
partly in reaction to improved growing conditions for the southern
soybean crop.
   Rain fell Monday in the Mississippi Delta region, where
drier-than-normal conditions had raised concerns about the soybean
crop.
   Weather forecasts predicted a continuation of beneficial crop
weather in the Midwest, where the bulk of U.S. corn and soybeans
are grown.
   In a six-to-10-day forecast released after the close, the
National Weather Service predicted normal- to above-normal
temperatures and normal precipitation in the Midwest for the first
half of next week.
   A 30-day forecast projected warmer and drier-than-normal
conditions for the region through mid-September.
   Corn and soybean development continues to lag well behind the
normal pace, according to the Agriculture Department's weekly crop
progress report, which was also released after the close.
   Wheat futures settled 3 cents to 7{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $2.75\ a bushel; corn was 2
cents to 5 cents lower with September at $2.45\ a bushel; oats were
3 cents to 3{ cents lower with September at $1.16 a bushel;
soybeans were 5{ cents to 14 cents lower with August at $6.03\ a
bushel.
   Strong cash markets helped lift near-term livestock and meat
futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle settled .15 cent lower to .23 cent higher with
August at 79.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .55
cent higher with August at 90.07 cents a pound; live hogs were .18
cent lower to .53 cent higher with August at 58.30 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .45 cent lower to 1.28 cents higher with
August at 48.90 cents a pound.

   A Wall Street blackout displaced Iraq's Saddam
Hussein as the bogeyman of the U.S. financial markets Monday,
disrupting trading in stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodites.
   The fire at a Con Edison power substation forced the American
Stock Exchange, New York Mercantile Exchange and other futures
markets in southern Manhattan to close by early afternoon.
   The New York Stock Exchange was unaffected by the outage but
trading volume slowed at the nation's biggest stock market as
electricity-starved offices elsewhere in the financial district
emptied.
   Thousands of workers from secretaries to investment bankers
flooded into traffic-snarled streets and headed home early.
Yellow-tinged smoke from the substation fire billowed through the
skyscraper canyons of southern Manhattan. Amid the confusion, oil
prices rose, gold surged, stocks and bonds were mixed and the
dollar fell.
   Amex spokesman Robert Shabazian said power was restored by late
afternoon and it planned to reopen Tuesday morning as normal. He
also said ``we're making provisions for auxiliary power in the
event there's another outage.''
   The disruptions in trading caused by the fire added to the
pressure bearing down on the markets since Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait Aug. 2. Among the markets that were forced to close early
was the volatile oil futures market at the New York Merc.
   ``It greatly affected us,'' said Peter Stern, a dealer at Refco
Inc., a leading New York commodities futures concern. ``Our phones
went down, our screens went down, a lot of people went home.''
   The fire forced an evacuation of several buildings including
parts of the World Trade Center and World Financial Center
complexes that frame southern Manhattan's skyline, leaving some of
the nation's biggest brokerage operations functioning with skeletal
crews.
   It briefly stalled the Dow Jones News Service and caused a more
serious and prolonged disruption to the Telerate Inc. news service,
two of the principal information pipelines feeding the markets.
   In addition, the fire hampered trading far beyond New York's
borders, since many key dealers based in the affected area were
forced to curtail business. This meant they could not move price
information to the network of computer screens and telephones that
form part of a global trading system.
   ``To sum it up real simple, the bond market more or less shut
down,'' said Mark McCluskey, who works on the bond trading desk at
the Manhattan office of Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co., a leading Swiss
bank.
   Many dealers shifted their trades to offices abroad such as
London and Tokyo, but others with speculative positions in the
market were left dangerously exposed.
   ``A number of our sources had no screens to work with, or didn't
want to say anything. The picture of the market suddenly
disappeared and a number of dealers were affected,'' said Bruce
Chalfant, assistant vice president for information services at
Telerate. ``I'm sure there are people who are not going to be
sleeping well. There was no close, things just stopped.''
   On the New York Merc, one of three key world oil markets besides
London and Singapore, the price of benchmark West Texas
Intermediate crude was up 54 cents to $26.77 a barrel when trading
shut down.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale
home-heating oil rose 2.44 cents to 75.05 cents a gallon, and
wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 3.35 cents to 82.80 cents a gallon.
   The exchange said the day's trading would be reflected in the
tally of transactions for Tuesday, when trading was expected to
return to normal.
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.20 points to 2,746.78,
but the broader market for stocks was mixed and trading was light
because of the power outage. The Amex market value index was down
1.18 to 338.14 before the outage.
   Prices in the bond market, an important barometer of interest
rates, were mixed in light volume as well.
   Gold was up $8.30 a troy ounce at $405.20 on the New York
Commodity Exchange when traded halted, the highest price since
early March and a signal of growing inflation anxiety caused by the
rise in oil.
   The dollar lost value, reflecting expectations that higher
interest rates abroad will make foreign currencies such as the
German mark and Japanese yen worth more.

<HEAD>Eastern, TWA Announce Discount Fare Promotions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two major airlines announced Monday they would cut some domestic
air fares for a limited time, offering the promotion at a time
major airlines have raised most ticket prices to account for
sharply higher fuel prices.
   Eastern Airlines announced new discount one-way fares that will
range from $69 to $139 and cover all Eastern's 62 U.S. destinations
from Sept. 5 through Dec. 16. The tickets must be purchased by Aug.
29, Eastern said.
   The cheaper fares, which will apply only to round-trip tickets
with a Saturday overnight stay, were announced two days before
Eastern's scheduled 5.3 percent hike in its other fares.
   Like other major airlines, Eastern is raising most of its fares
because of the jump in jet fuel prices following the Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait by Iraq and subsequent speculation of a
disruption in oil supplies.
   The discount fares aren't available for travel on Nov. 21 and
Nov. 25-26, but the tickets will be refundable, Eastern said.
   Separately, Trans World Airlines announced it would cut
non-refundable domestic fares in most markets 20 percent or more,
reducing the rate to $158 one-day from New York to St. Louis, for
example.
   Trans World spokesman Jim Faulkner said the company still plans
to raise international fares by $20 and might consider raising its
domestic fares in the future if fuel prices do not retreat.
   Trans World's cheaper tickets must be purchased between Tuesday
and Aug. 29 for travel between Sept. 5 and Dec. 16.
   Airlines that have announced fuel-related fare hikes include
Delta, United, USAir, Northwest, America West, Midway, Pan Am,
Southwest and Trump Shuttle.

<HEAD>Labor Officials File Charges Against Western Union Over Lockout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union lawyers filed an unfair
labor practices complaint with the National Labor Relations Board
Monday over Western Union Corp.'s lockout of about 2,000 workers.
   At the same time, employees represented by the Communications
Workers of America have set up informational picket lines at
Western Union telephone and computer centers, but said they had no
plans to call a strike.
   In its brief to the Washington-based labor board, the CWA
accused Western Union of acting illegally by imposing a selective
lockout on Saturday.
   About 500 service and business representatives, administrative
clerks and technicians have been asked to continue work, said
George Kohl, the union's director of research.
   Lawyers also are protesting that some temporary workers earn
more than union employees and that the company violated the
workers' rights to bargain and strike by locking them out.
   Kohl said he expects the labor relations board to set a calendar
date Tuesday.
   Union employees have been hoisting signs and distributing
information since the lockout was declared Saturday, but the
union's chief negotiator, Dan J. Beckstead, said the CWA has no
plans to call a strike.
   ``It is not a strike,'' Beckstead said, taking pains to
distinguish between the informational picket lines and strike
lines. ``No one has even suggested that we are going to strike.''
   Union employees authorized a walkout two weeks ago, but set no
date for a strike, said Beckstead, president of the Communications
Workers of America-United Telegraph Workers Bargaining Council.
   Monday, both sides expressed a desire to continue the contract
negotiations that began July 23, two weeks before a two-year
contract was due to expire.
   Talks continued after the agreement expired Aug. 6, but ran
aground on the company's desire to pare down medical benefits and
to contract union work to outside firms, Beckstead said.
   Western Union served notice Saturday that it would replace most
of its union employees unless labor officials reconsidered the
company's Aug. 8 offer to extend the expired contract by 90 days.
   Some temporary workers were on the job by 1 a.m. Saturday, with
2,200 replacements reporting to work Monday morning, said Western
Union spokesman Warren Bechtel.
   About 300 of the workers are Western Union managers and the rest
are locally hired and trained replacements, he said.
   Union workers total nearly 75 percent of the company's
nationwide staff of 3,400, Bechtel said.
   Operations at the giant telegram company have been slowed, but
not disrupted, Bechtel said.
   ``Services are being provided, and the level of service is good
and getting better,'' he said. ``You don't replace trained,
experienced people and overnight come up to same level of service,
but we're working on it.''
   Monday, pickets were concentrated at Western Union centers in
Bridgeton, Mo., and Reno, Nev., where major central phone bureaus
and a computer center are located, Beckstead said.

   Average gasoline prices dropped more than 3
cents nationwide this weekend after soaring nearly 18 cents as the
Persian Gulf crisis unfolded, the American Automobile Association
said Monday.
   AAA's national Fuel Gauge Report shows self-serve regular
unleaded averages $1.216 per gallon, down 3.4 cents since Friday.
   In Detroit on Monday, the average price fell .6 cents to $1.184
per gallon. In St. Louis, it fell .6 cents to $1.063 per gallon,
and in Kansas City, it dropped 1.7 cents to $1.121.
   In Washington, motorists were paying $1.157 per gallon, up .7
cents since Friday. The average costs in the capital had dropped 2
cents between Wednesday and Friday.
   In southern Indiana, the average price, which dropped 5 cents
overnight Friday, increased 1 cent Monday to $1.22 per gallon.
   Monday's survey was based on a spot check of stations nationwide
by Computer Petroleum Corp. of St. Paul, Minn. The company also
publishes the National Petroleum Price Index, which monitors more
than 50,000 daily wholesale prices in the United States and Canada.
   The Orlando-based AAA is a not-for-profit federation of motor
clubs with nearly 32 million members in the United States and
Canada.

<HEAD>Union Says USAir Will Lay Off 211 Pilots</HEAD>

   USAir Group Inc. said Monday it would lay
off about 200 pilots in a cutback that could also affect flight
attendants and other employees, a spokeswoman for the airline said.
   ``We will not fly as much new service as originally planned, in
view of the state of the economy,'' spokeswoman Susan Young said in
explaining the layoffs. She said she could not elaborate on the
number of workers involved or when they might be let go.
   Earlier Monday, the Air Line Pilots Association announced to
members that the Arlington, Va.-based carrier had decided to lay
off 211 pilots around the end of the year.
   The union told its members in a tape-recorded telephone message
that it learned of the plans last week in Los Angeles during a
meeting with USAir President Seth Schofield and other airline
executives.
   USAir Group lost $113.1 million in the first half of this year,
and has not posted a profit since the second quarter of 1989.
   ``I think it's safe to say that the airline's traffic and the
industry's traffic is flat,'' she said.
   She also said the airline may have too many pilots for its
fleet. The excess could have resulted from ``older aircraft and
rescheduling of aircraft deliveries,'' she said. Twelve new jets
had been scheduled for arrival this year, but USAir delayed taking
delivery in an unusual cost-cutting move.
   It also has tried to save money by paying less overtime to
maintenance crews.
   The union message said Schofield told the pilots' Master
Executive Council that USAir foresees a further decline in traffic
and higher fuel prices.
   The vice chairman of ALPA's Master Executive Council, Chris
Beebe, urged the pilots to adhere exactly to the wording in their
contract and not to fly overtime.

<HEAD>Commission Stays Order Releasing Key Parts Of Trump Documents</HEAD>

   An angry state Casino Control
Commission on Monday ordered Donald Trump to release information on
a restructuring that puts the developer's three Atlantic City
casinos up as collateral.
   However, the commission delayed its order for 24 hours to allow
Trump's attorneys to appeal the decision.
   The panel ordered all the documents unsealed after Trump's
attorneys asked for a blanket order sealing the more than 1,000
pages of documents detailing a $65 million emergency loan for Trump.
   The loan was arranged in June after Trump missed a date to make
a payment on bonds sold to finance Trump Castle Casino Resort By
The Bay. Trump made the payment within a 10-day grace period after
receiving a bridge loan while paperwork on the $65 million deal was
finished.
   Under the agreement, Trump for the first time is using his
casinos as collateral for financial assistance. The agreement with
the banks will restructure about $1 billion of his $1.3 billion
casino debt and $1.9 billion in other debts.
   The commission is scheduled to review the bailout on Thursday
and members say they want the plan's underpinnings available to the
public. Attorneys Nicholas Ribis and Joseph Fusco said the
sensitivity of the documents could jeopardize the negotiations.
   Acting commission chairwoman Valerie Armstrong said in a
scathing opinion that Trump's attorneys again failed to prove why
the public should not know the details of Trump's restructuring.
   ``This proposal would, if approved by the commission,
collateralize Mr. Trump's ownership of three of the largest casino
hotels in Atlantic City,'' Ms. Armstrong said. ``It is indisputable
that the economic structure and stability of Trump's casino
holdings in this state is a matter of public concern.''
   She rejected the argument that details of Trump's problems would
hamper his deal-making efforts.
   ``It is certainly no secret to the marketplace that Mr. Trump is
experiencing serious financial difficulties,'' Ms. Armstrong said.
   Since its April 2 opening, the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort has
hovered around the $1.3 million a day in gross gaming revenues that
analysts said it needed to show a profit. However, those figures
were achieved in months skewed by the attention given the opening
and by higher numbers traditionally recorded by the casinos during
the summer.
   Trump's other casinos _ Trump Castle and Trump Plaza Hotel and
Casino _ have posted faltering numbers since the Taj Mahal's
opening.
   By a 4-1 vote, the commission rejected attorneys' requests to
seal the documents that included a debt repayment schedule for
Trump, which Ms. Armstrong termed, ``the key inquiry of the
upcoming hearing.''
   In another development related to Trump's restructuring, Ribis
said First Boston Corp. would handle the restructuring, replacing
Merrill Lynch Corp., which left last week.

   Boston area investor Andre Danesh announced
plans Monday to seek a major stake in the stock of Southmark Corp.
which recently emerged from bankruptcy reorganization.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Danesh
disclosed he and entities he controls have 9.9 percent of
Southmark's common stock. Most recently, Danesh sold 176,800
Southmark shares between July 16 and Aug. 6 at prices ranging from
9 cents and 22 cents per share.
   But Danesh, a Brookline, Mass. investor who specializes in
buying the stock of troubled companies, said he intends to buy up
to 100 percent of new preferred stock, 100 percent of new notes and
up to 49 percent of new common stock expected to be issued by
Southmark, a Dallas-based real estate investment company, this week
as part of its reorganization.
