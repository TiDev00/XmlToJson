   Czechoslovakia's new ambassador to the United
States has an early form of leukemia and is trying to decide
whether to remain in this country or return to her own, The
Washington Post said in its Wednesday editions.
   ``It's not that we don't have good doctors at home,'' Ambassador
Rita Klimova told the newspaper. ``But we don't have the ability to
protect patients from infection. That requires a high degree of
sophistication in the hospitals.''
   The ambassador, who assumed her diplomatic post five months ago,
said her government will pay her medical bills, but she is
concerned about the finances and does not want to run up a big tab.
   She said her decision on whether to stay in the United States
will depend on finding treatment that ``fits in with someone's
research plans.''
   Ms. Klimova became ill in May, but the leukemia diagnosis is
recent, the newspaper said.
   Leukemia is a form of cancer of the blood-cell forming system.
Though the disease once was considered invariably fatal, treatment
has improved dramatically in recent decades and years, and complete
remissions may be obtained for some types.

   A 60-year-old public radio personality
suffered a stroke while hosting his classical music show Tuesday
morning and died a few hours later.
   Listeners to WETA-FM heard four minutes of empty air after
announcer Bill Cerri began garbling his words and left his open
microphone about 9 a.m.
   Long pauses are not unusual for classical music stations, but
listeners sensed something was amiss and started calling the
station, said Joe Davis, chief engineer for WETA.
   ``Our listeners were right on top of the situation,'' Davis
said. ``Gosh, they knew that something was wrong with Bill. They
were calling immediately.''
   Cerri was taken to National Hospital for Orthopaedics and
Rehabilitation in Arlington, Va., where he died at 1:38 p.m.
   He had a number of health problems, including Parkinson's
disease, and had planned to take a disability retirement next month.

<HEAD>Launching Commercial Satellites is a High-Risk Industry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Imagine you paid a company to move your
belongings from California to New York. In Kansas, the truck breaks
down. You end up paying someone else to haul your stuff the rest of
the way _ but it takes another couple of years.
   To add insult to injury, the first mover goes to court to
forestall any attempt to get your money back.
   Farfetched? Well, that's about what is happening in the nervous,
competitive, megabucks business of launching satellites for profit.
And the moving company in this case _ the giant Martin Marietta
Corp. _ claims it may have to get out of the commercial launching
business if it loses in court.
   Martin Marietta is one of only three major American companies in
that infant of private enterprise and the only one lifting the
heaviest satellites. Should Martin Marietta's prediction come true,
the European consortium Arianespace, the Chinese, the Soviets _ and
someday the Japanese _ all will be waiting, rockets at the ready.
   Here is what happened:
   For $111.5 million, Martin Marietta agreed to launch a satellite
for Intelsat, the international communications consortium. The
satellite, valued at $157 million, lifted off from Cape Canaveral,
Fla., on March 14 aboard Martin Marietta's Titan 3 rocket.
   Once in orbit, the satellite and the spent Titan were to
separate and a much smaller booster attached to the Intelsat 6 was
to take it on the next 22,000 miles of its journey to its work
station. But Martin Marietta had miswired the rocket, the
separation didn't take place and the satellite was trapped in a
useless orbit.
   Engineers were finally able to split the two and Intelsat 6 is
awaiting a 1992 visit by NASA astronauts who will attach a new
booster rocket and send the satellite on its way. This will cost
Intelsat another $90 million.
   According to a suit filed by Bethesda, Md.-based Martin Marietta
in federal court in Baltimore, Intelsat demanded damages. Martin
Marietta called that ``unlawfully coercive demands.''
   The launch firm said its contract called only for a replacement
launch at an undisclosed price ``in the event the Titan 3 mission
fails for any reason.'' Intelsat could have bought insurance but
didn't.
   ``I don't want to call it a pre-emptive strike,'' said Martin
Marietta corporate spokesman Elliott H. Miller. ``We did this
because it became clear they were going to file a civil damage
suit. We are asking the court to essentially declare that the
provisions of our contract are enforceable.''
   A question at the heart of the suit filed by Martin Marietta is
what constitutes a launch. Miller says that under terms of the
contract with Intelsat ``when the engines are fired, that
constituted a launch.''
   Intelsat has until Sept. 4 to file an answer. A spokesman, Tony
Trujillo, said the dispute is unfortunate because ``we don't have
an ax to grind.'' He would not comment on the suit.
   In its complaint, Martin Marietta said that if it is forced to
pay damages on the failed launch it may have to raise prices to an
uncompetitive level or ``terminate its commercial launch business.''
   To date, Martin Marietta has sold only four launches on the
Titan 3 and its competitors say privately that the company might be
getting out of the commercial launch business anyway. It has plenty
of military customers.
   ``It's been a very competitive business,'' said spokesman
Miller. ``One of the differences in competition has been the entry
of foreign _ really government-owned and supported _ competitors
such as China and now the Soviet Union.''
   To put that competition on a level playing field, President Bush
this week is expected to sign a new space policy setting forth
conditions under which other countries can enter U.S. launch
markets.
   The president also is expected to sign an agreement under which
a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp. will be allowed to help
build a launch facility in Australia that might someday be used by
the Soviets.
   Such technical assistance requires an export license, and that
has led to erroneous reports that the United States will be
agreeing to send up American-built satellites on Soviet rockets.
   ``The real competition in launching heavyweight satellites is
between ourselves and General Dynamics,'' said Douglas Heydon,
president of Arianespace's American subsidiary. General Dynamics
markets the Atlas.
   Spokesman Trujillo said Intelsat would have no hesitancy in
purchasing launches from China or the Soviet Union. ``A diversity
of suppliers is a situation we like to encourage,'' he said.
Intelsat is a cooperative of 119 nations, including China. The
Soviets are not members, but they use Intelsat's services.

   It can't be easy being Jeff Sagansky these
days.
   Six months on the job, in charge of entertainment for the
bottom-rated TV network, and everyone looking to you for a failsafe
way to rocket out of last place.
   So there he stood before the nation's TV critics at their annual
press tour this past weekend, proudly hyping CBS' new fall shows.
   The reporters wanted to talk about sex.
   And morality. And questionable dialogue uttered by children
during peak, prime-time family viewing hours.
   Specifically, the reporters wanted to know why a 6-year-old girl
will be delivering lines such as ``you suck'' at 8 p.m. on Mondays.
   The show in question is ``Uncle Buck,'' a fall TV spinoff of the
John Candy film. In the pilot, the blond, cherubic child star also
explains the crankiness of a female family member by saying ``she's
ovulating.''
   Some of the reporters at the Century Plaza Hotel news conference
Sunday appeared righteously indignant.
   ``How can you say, Mr. Sagansky, that the networks are more
sensitive now when you do have programs like `Uncle Buck' coming on
the air?'' demanded one critic.
   Looking a bit uneasy, Sagansky replied, ``I'll tell you
something, believe it or not, kids say that in homes all over
America. And I don't think we can go and put on shows which have no
relationship to reality.''
   Besides, Sagansky added, the child is immediately reprimanded
for such talk, and future episodes do not consistently contain that
kind of dialogue.
   The reporters were unappeased and the 37-year-old,
Harvard-educated programming executive spent much of the 45-minute
press conference defending his network's standards.
   Or lack thereof, as some critics grumbled.
   Although a lot of time was spent dissecting the social value of
``Uncle Buck,'' many questions also concerned Sagansky's strategy
for boosting ratings.
   Sagansky admitted his work is cut out for him. Part of his game
plan for enhancing CBS' schedule has focused on wooing top writers
and producers.
   That included giving carte blanche to Linda Bloodworth-Thomason
and Harry Thomason, creators of the network's hit ``Designing
Women.''
   What the Thomasons came up with was ``Evening Shade,'' a comedy
about life in a small Arkansas town that debuts with a one-hour
pilot on Sept. 21.
   Starring Burt Reynolds, ``Evening Shade'' was one of three shows
that Sagansky touted as having the fall schedule's ``most unique
voice.''
   The others were ``WIOU,'' a drama about a TV news operation in
Chicago, and ``Lenny,'' a blue-collar situation comedy starring
stand-up comic Lenny Clarke, a former Boston janitor.
   Sagansky also was asked about the wisdom of putting ``The
Flash'' _ a new fantasy action thriller about a man who moves so
fast his feet nearly catch fire _ on Thursdays at 8 p.m.
   The time period has been dominated for years by NBC's top-rated
``The Cosby Show,'' and Fox Broadcasting Co. recently announced a
gutsy decision to move the phenomenally successful ``Simpsons''
family to the same half-hour slot.
   ``I knew that we had a great idea when we went in Thursday at
8,'' Sagansky said. ``Unfortunately, we weren't the only ones who
had that idea.''
   Fox has admitted that if ``The Simpsons'' bomb in their new time
period, they will probably be sent back to Sunday nights, Sagansky
said.
   ``So I don't want to run away from them, particularly if they're
not going to be there.''
   On the subject of the street-smart alternative network, Sagansky
was asked if Fox could ever beat one of the big three in the
overall Nielsen ratings.
   ``Not during my watch,'' Sagansky replied. ``Absolutely not.''
   Another crucial aspect of Sagansky's vision, he said, is to lure
younger viewers to CBS.
   ``When we talk about younger viewers for CBS, we're talking
about people, you know, less than 60,'' he told reporters, who
erupted in laughter.
   ``Look, for CBS, I'M a younger viewer.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a look at how a $100 billion spending
cut would be triggered by the Gramm-Rudman law, and what it would
mean:
   HOW IT WORKS:
   The White House's Office of Management and Budget estimated
Monday that the fiscal 1991 deficit will hit $168.8 billion, or
$231.4 billion if the savings and loan bailout is counted. Between
now and Oct. 1 _ the start of the new fiscal year _ OMB will
monitor any new laws that affect spending or government revenue
collections and take them into account. If the projected deficit
exceeds $74 billion on Oct. 1 _ $10 billion above the target _
spending is cut temporarily by whatever amount is needed to reduce
the shortfall to $64 billion. The cuts take effect permanently on
Oct. 15.
   Savings and loan rescue spending is included in the deficit
calculations under current law, but many in Congress and the Bush
administration want to exclude those costs.
   DISTRIBUTION OF CUTS:
   50 percent to defense, 50 percent to domestic programs. But
portions are exempt in full or in part.
   _ Defense: About one-third of the $300 billion defense budget is
exempt from Gramm-Rudman cuts because it has already been committed
to long-term contracts. Of the remaining amount, the law allows the
president to exempt personnel costs, such as salaries.
   He chose not to exempt personnel last year. If he made the same
choice this time, according to OMB, this could mean dismissal of
about 1 million troops, about half of the active-duty force;
layoffs or dismissals of up to half the military's 1.1 million
civilian employees, and a cut in weapon acquisition programs, such
as reducing the request for major new naval ships from 15 to 11.
   If personnel costs were exempted, remaining programs would be
slashed by 41.3 percent. This would mean that the amount of flight
time for aircraft and steaming time for ships would be cut by half
and about 80 percent of the military's civilian workers could lose
their jobs.
   _ Domestic: Completely exempt from cuts are interest on the
national debt; Social Security and several federal retirement and
disability programs; several low-income programs including food
stamps, Medicaid and child nutrition aid, and many veterans'
programs.
   Several other programs can be cut only partially. Cuts in
Medicare and some health programs for veterans and migrants are
limited to 2 percent reductions. There are also special rules for
support payments to farmers and for Guaranteed Student Loans.
   Spending on those programs subject to the full brunt of the cuts
would be reduced by 38.4 percent. According to OMB, that could mean
a one-year delay in hazardous waste cleanups at Energy Department
sites; elimination of vaccines for polio, measles and other
diseases for 1 million children; a 20 percent cut for FBI
investigations into organized crime, and prevention of government
plans to upgrade airline security overseas.
   DURATION OF CUTS:
   By law, they remain in effect for the entire fiscal year once
Oct. 15 passes. But ``permanent'' Gramm-Rudman cuts have been
rolled back before, most recently just last fall.

<HEAD>Veto Threatened if Senate Crop Supports Enacted</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is threatening a veto
of the 1990 farm bill if the crop support programs in the version
expected to be debated this week in the Senate reaches the White
House.
   The announcement came in a letter Monday to the Senate from
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who said the programs were
too costly at a time when the government is trying to cut the
budget deficit.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Agriculture
Committee, immediately criticized the letter as an ``eleventh-hour
threat'' aimed at killing the five-year bill as part of an
international trade negotiating strategy being pursued by President
Bush and Yeutter.
   Senate leaders have said they would try to begin debate on the
bill by Wednesday.
   Leahy's committee has estimated that the commodity programs in
the bill would cost $55 billion over five years, but Yeutter said
its spending requirements amount to $59 billion.
   This compares with an estimated $79.4 billion spent over the
last five years under the 1985 law that expires this year.
   The veto threat follows efforts by Bush at the seven-nation
economic summit in Houston last week to get the Europeans to reduce
subsidies on farm products that the United States considers
distorting to the international marketplace.
   A five-year farm bill could be viewed as limiting the promises
negotiators could make to the other countries about U.S. policy.
But members of the Senate and House agriculture committees have
said they would make necessary adjustments based on the outcome of
the ongoing talks over the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
in Geneva, Switzerland.
   The administration has indicated support for a one-year
extension of the current farm law. Senate Republican Leader Bob
Dole of Kansas said on Friday he would offer such legislation if
the spending in the bill going to the floor is not reduced.
   ``The administration's veto threat is a thinly veiled effort to
kill the farm bill so the administration can cut a back-room deal
in Geneva, out of sight of the American farmer,'' said Leahy.
   Yeutter didn't mention the trade talks in his letter. He dwelled
instead on the budget implications of the Senate's farm bill,
criticizing every subsidy program in the legislation.
   ``From a budget standpoint, the cost of the bill is excessive,''
he said.
   Yeutter said that if the bill is sent to the president before
budget talks with Congress are completed and without substantial
savings and a change in the price and income support programs,
``the secretary of agriculture and the president's other senior
advisers would recommend that he (Bush) veto the bill.''
   The government subsidizes farmers who produce wheat, corn, rice,
cotton, soybeans, sugar, dairy products, wool and mohair, honey and
peanuts either by direct payment or manipulation of the marketplace.
   Leahy said the administration had ``cooked up new numbers'' in
estimating the bill's impact on the budget.
   ``The reality is that the Senate farm bill is over $6 billion
less than what the president proposed in January for current
services,'' he said.

   Whether Marie Antoinette ever really said, ``Let
them eat cake'' remains in doubt, but 17 pastry chefs have created
in wondrous constructions of chocolate and marzipan the cake she
might have had in mind.
   Cakes that no peasant in pre-Revolutionary France likely ever
got to taste surrounded a life-size ice sculpture of a guillotine
and two cannons at the Plaza Hotel on Monday.
   Pastry chef Martin Howard of the Hudson River Club in New York
designed three necklaces of chocolate jewels spilling out of
chocolate jewel boxes. Pascal Scirrotto of Restaurant Deja-Vu in
Philadelphia made a croquembouche, a towering, traditional wedding
cake then and now in France.
   There even was a cake of three kinds of caviar, cream cheeses
and Scotch salmon from Bruce Sobol of Caviarteria in New York.
   The fifth annual Bastille Day celebration, though two days late,
ended with the selection of three of the chefs as the U.S. team for
the International World Cup Pastry Competition next January in
Lyon, France.
   One of them, Mary Cech from Jackson at Montgomery in San
Francisco, prepared a fanciful tea party in chocolate, with a
teapot of chocolate, elaborate place mats and lace napkins of white
chocolate, and a cake of chocolate and strawberry.
   ``I went for a theme that was light and frilly,'' Cech said as
she handed out tastes of her cake for judges and guests.
   The two other chefs going to France are Gil Renusson, executive
pastry chef at the Amway Grand Plaza in Grand Rapids, Mich., and
pastry chef Eric Bedoucha of the restaurant Adrienne at the
Peninsula Hotel in New York.
   In a second competition, celebrity judges were given sheets to
score their favorites. Some of the judges attracted as much
attention as the cakes. A crowd pressed around judge Ivana Trump,
the estranged wife of Donald Trump, wherever she stopped. Other
judges included designer Mary McFadden and Robin Leach of
``Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.''
   Perhaps the plainest Jane cake was a chocolate sheet cake
presented by pastry chef Chad Gilchrist of the Plaza Hotel.
   He had made a 2-foot-high replica of Versailles, with Marie
Antoinette throwing cake to a crowd.
   But earlier in the day a door hit Gilchrist, and the cake went
flying.
   It was destroyed.
   ``It was most disappointing,'' he said. ``Two days of work ended
on a sour note.''
   The event was a benefit for the Pierre Franey Scholarship Fund
at Johnson &amp; Wales University in Rhode Island. Pastry fans paid $50
a ticket.

<TEXT>
   While most of Europe is on the
threshold of unification, Yugoslavia's deeply divided states cannot
agree on how to remain together. The troubled Balkan country is on
the brink of disintegration.
   Some politicians maintain that Yugoslavia has already falle
apart.
   ``Yugoslavia no longer exists,'' said Dimitrij Rupel, foreign
minister of Slovenia, the republic leading the rebellion against
Yugoslavia as the world has known it for the last 70 years.
   The country was formed as a joint kingdom of Serbs, Croats and
Slovenes in the aftermath of World War I.
   After being occupied and dismembered by the Germans in 1941, it
re-emerged as a Communist-style federation of six ``peoples'
republics'' with Macedonia, Montenegro and Bosnia-Hercegovina added
to the three pre-war states under Yugoslavia's Communist founder
Josip Broz Tito.
   During the Cold War, Tito's nationalist politics were useful to
the West, which provided significant financial and other support to
non-aligned Yugoslavia as a check on Soviet influence in the
sensitive Balkans.
   This in turn helped Tito impose unity and the rule of a
Communist Party that ostensibly rose above Yugoslavia's traditional
ethnic rivalries.
   But traditional ethnic and regional rivalries began to bubble
after Tito's death in 1980. And the message of greater democracy
and human rights that spurred last year's revolutions in Eastern
Europe also worked against the old-style centralized rule from
Belgrade.
   On July 2, Slovenia proclaimed its full sovereignty,
establishing an independent legal system and asserting the right to
control all armed forces stationed on its territory.
   On the same day, ethnic Albanian deputies of the volatile
southern province of Kosovo announced plans to secede from Serbia,
the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics.
   Croatia, the second-largest republic, has already demanded
radical reshaping of the federal system bequeathed by Tito.
President Franjo Tudjman's center-right party won a landslide
victory in the republic's free elections this spring.
   Slovenia's freely elected president, Milan Kucan, said this
month that his republic will secede, either alone or with Croatia,
if the country does not swiftly become a loose confederation of
fully independent states.
   ``The only thing that could keep us together is constant and
brutal repression,'' Rupel said _ an apparent reference to repeated
warnings by the Communist-run armed forces that the ``battle for
Yugoslavia will not be fought without the military.''
   In contrast, the Communist leaders of Serbia want a federal
system with a strong central authority and they oppose free
elections.
   Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's president, has effectively ruled
out confederation. He has said Serbia would agree only if its
present borders are revised to include the estimated 2 million
Serbs in Croatia and the central region of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
   Retaining Kosovo, an ancient Serbian heartland now dominated by
ethnic Albanians, and the assertion of Serbian nationalism appear
to take precedence over ties with Slovenia and traditional rival
Croatia.
   Many Yugoslavs fear that Milosevic's demands, which brought him
wide popularity among the Serbs, could trigger ethnic violence.
   Rupel described Milosevic's aspirations as ``lunatic.''
   Behind the ethnic divisions lurk other clashes over introducing
democacy and integrating Yugoslavia with Western Europe.
   Slovenia and Croatia want to join the integration processes
going on throughout Europe. In July, their officials held
exploratory talks with the European Community on eventually joining
the grouping.
   The EC and the United States, however, view Yugoslavia as a
single country and would like it to remain that way.
   It is difficult to see how the Yugoslavs can reconcile their
deep differences to meet Western demands for unity and for an
improved human rights record.
   Amnesty International and the European Parliament repeatedly
have condemned what they see as gross human rights violations by
Serbia against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
   At least 60 Kosovo Albanians, who demand full autonomy and free
elections, have died in clashes with Serbian security forces since
March 1989, when Serbia virtually abolished the region's
self-government. Thousands have spent time in jail, and Serbia has
muzzled ethnic Albanian media.
   For many Yugoslavs, federal premier Ante Markovic remains the
only integrating factor among the feuding republics.
   Markovic won widespread admiration for a remarkably swift
economic turnaround, and his market-oriented programs have received
wide support from Western governments and financial institutions.
   But optimism only a month ago that Markovic could translate his
economic success into political clout and use it to form a new
party has evaporated in the face of Slovenia's declaration of
sovereignty and Serbia's reaction.
   Even Yugoslavia's collective presidency, nominally in charge of
the country, seems unwilling or unable to stop the disintegration.
   Borisav Jovic, the Serb now heading the country's collective
presidency, has suggested a referendum to determine whether
individual nationalities want to remain united in one country.

   Forty miles and a half-century away from
Italy, citizens of this Albanian coastal city dream about a life
without communism.
   ``We all dream of Italy,'' sighed a waiter at a government-run
restaurant.
   Residents interviewed Monday by a reporter on a one-day ferry
trip from Italy all expressed a desire to go abroad.
   Some appeared to want to live better. Others longed to escape
the grip of Europe's last hard-line Communist government.
   Their quick, whispered comments suggested that the discontent
that drove thousands of Albanians to seek refuge this month in
embassies in the capital city of Tirana is no isolated phenomemon
in this tiny Balkan nation.
   ``There's nothing in this country to live for,'' a young
economist said angrily.
   Like the others interviewed, he spoke on condition of anonymity.
Albanians can receive harsh punishments for contacts with
foreigners.
   Vlore, 60 miles southwest of Tirana and just 40 miles across the
Adriatic Sea from Italy, provides a glimpse of life in Europe's
poorest and most isolated country.
   Most of the 70,000 residents live in five-story apartment
buildings lined up like matchboxes. Laundry flaps from the
balconies. In the rocky, white dirt lots around the buildings, thin
children in patched clothes and rubber thongs play in a baking sun.
   Asked whether residents had problems getting enough food, a
mechanic looked around to see if anyone was listening, then nodded.
   A silence hangs over the city because of an absence of cars,
which individuals are not allowed to own. On the broad, palm-lined
road to the Vlore port, horses and wagons rattle past bicyclists.
   But nearly every building has a television antenna, allowing
residents to watch Italian television.
   Several residents, spotting a group of Italian tourists on
Monday, called out the names of Italian soccer players. A few
debated the merits of Italian pop stars.
   One student, a member of the Roman Catholic minority, said he
liked to watch Pope John Paul II on Italian television. Until
recently, religious observances were banned in Albania.
   ``When I see him, I cry,'' he said.
   It was through Italian TV that many Albanians learned about the
revolutions in Eastern Europe last year, as well as the boatlift
that carried about 4,500 Albanian asylum-seekers to Italy and
France last week. Many had spent more than a week packed into
embassies in the capital before the government decided to let them
leave under the supervision of foreign diplomats.
   Those interviewed Monday spoke of widespread discontent in the
country of 3 million people. But they said they did not expect a
revolution like the ones that overtook other Eastern European
countries.
   ``There are so many simple people here,'' said the economist.
   A university student said that most people would be content once
the Communist government carried out the limited reforms it has
announced since spring. They include giving everyone over 16 the
right to a passport and foreign travel. Albanians have not had such
a privilege for 45 years.
   Limited reform seemed unlikely, however, to appease a group of
factory workers standing outside their plant.
   Asked about living conditions, they laughed bitterly and one
uttered an expletive. Then they asked about the possibility of jobs
in Italy.
   Most of those interviewed spoke quietly and looked around
nervously, showing the widespread fear of the powerful Sigurimi
secret police.
   At one point, a van of police pulled up at the government-run
restaurant. All but one of a group of youths talking to a Western
reporter shrank away.
   ``I haven't done anything wrong,'' declared the youth, as police
glared at him.
   A moment later, several officers approached and ordered him off.
   He slunk down the road to a tree, from which he watched the
foreigners and apparently continued to ponder life across the sea.

   A pair of neighbors feared they would be
taking a bath on bills for more than 140,000 gallons of water, but
the local water company says it wasn't trying to soak them.
   The Lemont Water Co. billed Eugene Emerick for 79,000 gallons of
water during the second quarter of 1989. For John Paul Devereaux,
it was a 64,000-gallon question.
   ``I was wondering what I did with all that water,'' Emerick
said. ``I think I'd have to bathe three times a day and drink water
all day to use that much.''
   When Devereaux got his bill, ``The first thing I did was go
downstairs and look at the cellar to see if it was flooded.''
   Devereaux said his normal water bill totaled $17 per quarter.
The inaccurate bill he received this month was for $70.15.
   Emerick said his bill was $80 before the mistake was caught. His
real bill totaled $17.54.
   Cindy Rose, a spokeswoman for the 2,000-customer water company,
said computer errors were responsible.
   ``There were too many zeroes on there,'' Rose said.
   What made the bills even harder to understand was that Centre
County had 12.42 inches of rain during the April-June period
covered by the bill _ 9.8 percent above normal.
   Devereaux did win three swimming events at the Centre County
Senior Games this summer, but he said he didn't have a pool to
account for his big bill.
   ``With this rain, we haven't even watered the garden,'' he said.

   The jury weighing the case of four defendants
charged with complicity in the slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique
Camarena began their deliberations Monday.
   The jury began weighing two months of evidence presented them
during trial. After meeting for several hours, they retired without
reaching a verdict. Deliberations were set to resume Tuesday.
   Closing arguments ended Friday and U.S. District Judge Edward
Rafeedie gave the jurors their instructions Monday morning.
   On trial are Ruben Zuno Arce, Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros and
Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez and Javier Vasquez Velasco.
   The group is charged with conspiring in 1985 Camarena's kidnap
and murder near Guadalajara, Mexico. The killing strained U.S.
relations with its southern neighbor.
   Bernabe also is charged with the murder of Camarena's pilot,
Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
   The beaten and tortured bodies of Camarena and his pilot were
found in March 1985. Prosecutors contend the men killed Camarena
and Zavala in retaliation for the drug agent's pursuit and
crackdown of cocaine and marijuana traffickers in Guadalajara.
   Vasquez is charged with helping kill Americans John Walker and
Alberto Radelat. The two walked into a restaurant in Guadalajara a
week before Camarena was abducted and were mistaken for DEA agents.
   In all, 22 people have been charged in Los Angeles in connection
with the murders.

<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An annual market survey by the Agriculture
Department shows the rate of farmland sales through financial
failure declined last year.
   Nationally, voluntary and estate sales accounted for 70 percent
of the farmland transfers in the latter part of 1989, compared with
66 percent in the same period of 1988.
   Sales or transfers among family members accounted for 16 percent
of the land transactions, about the same as the preceding year, the
department's Economic Research Service said.
   ``Another 11 percent represented foreclosure, bankruptcy and
condemnation sales and transfers (against 15 percent in 1988),
while 3 percent fell into the `other' sales and transfers category
(the same as in 1988),'' the report said.
   Officials said the survey included information on nearly 6,600
farmland sales involving more than 2 million acres.
   The research agency's annual farmland market survey was
described in a new Agricultural Resources outlook report
elaborating on figures announced in April that showed U.S. farmland
prices rose 4 percent in 1989.
   A further gain of between 3 percent and 4 percent is forecast
for 1990, based upon the current economic outlook.
   The report said other farmers continue to buy most of the land
sold during the year, accounting for 59 percent of the purchases
last year, compared with 57 percent in 1988.
   Tenants made 12 percent of the purchases, compared with 11
percent the previous year. Non-farmers accounted for 27 percent,
down from 29 percent in 1988, and retired farmers, 2 percent,
unchanged.
   ``Shares among buyer groups have been fairly stable over the
past several years,'' the report said. ``Ten years ago,
owner-operators were involved in 50 percent of the reported
purchases, with tenants (15 percent), retired farmers (2 percent),
and non-farmers (33 percent) accounting for the rest.''
   The report also noted that nearly 41 percent of all U.S.
farmland operated in 1989 was rented, according to another survey
on farm costs and returns.
   ``Leasing was most widespread in the Corn Belt, Northern Plains,
Southern Plains and (Mississippi) Delta states, where 50 to 55
percent of all land operated was leased,'' the report said. ``In
other regions, the proportion of leasing ranged from 28 percent in
the Southeast to 35 percent in the Mountain region.''
   Tenants most often leased land on a cash-rent basis, accounting
for 66 percent of all rented land last year. Thirty percent was
rented for shares of production and 4 percent was rent-free.

   The structure and volume of Japan's
agricultural trade has changed substantially over the long haul,
despite a popular perception of inflexibility, according to an
Agriculture Department analyst.
   Rapidly changing economies in then Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe have dominated the world's attention, says William Coyle of
USDA's Economic Research Service.
   ``Japan, by contrast, often appears reluctant to change because
of persistent and large trade surpluses, an inhospitable attitude
about foreign investment and imports, and a political system
dominated for 35 years by one party,'' he said.
   But changes do occur in Japan, but they sometimes go unnoticed
because they are slow and incremental.
   Bulk commodities such as grain, soybeans, cotton and tobacco
still make up most of Japan's agricultural imports, but Coyle said
value-added products are accounting for a growing share.
   Tariff reductions, deregulation of foreign cigarette imports and
more beef and citrus since 1985 helped push Japan's value-added
imports to $12 billion in 1988, up 20 percent from 1970.
   In 1988, when Japan's agricultural imports were valued at $27.2
billion, bulk commodities made up 55.4 percent of the total. In
1970, when they were worth $4.2 billion, grains and other bulk
items accounted for 79.8 percent.
   Coyle, writing in a new outlook report on world agriculture,
said the changes have meant more meat, less imported grain; more
cigarettes, less leaf tobacco; more finished textile products, less
raw fibers; and more pasta and less wheat.

   A package of queen honeybees from a
90-year-old monk in England is being added to the Agriculture
Department's weaponry against the destructive tracheal mite.
   The 15 queen bees from Brother Adam in Buckfastleigh, England,
will be used by scientists at the department's bee laboratory in
Baton Rouge, La., to breed mite-resistant strains.
   Ralph A. Bram of the department's Agricultural Research Service
said the breeding program will take two or three years. If
successful, new queens will be distributed to bee breeders.
   Parasitic tracheal mites clog the breathing tubes of bees,
killing 80 percent or more of a hive.
   Brother Adam, a resident of the abbey since 1910, began keeping
bees at age 16, the agency said. He has written reports that his
bees withstand mite attacks ``even when in identical environments
other races and crosses collapsed mid-season.''

<HEAD>South African Reminded of Past at Rally in Mozambique</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At a rally in his honor, Nelson
Mandela received a souvenir from the past _ a framed copy of an
arrest warrant issued for him in 1962 by the Portuguese colonial
rulers of Mozambique.
   Amid much laughter from the crowd, President Joaquim Chissano
presented the memento to Mandela on Monday. The South African black
nationalist leader is on the last stop of a 14-nation tour of
Africa, Europe and North America.
   The warrant described Mandela as a ``black agitator'' in South
Africa last seen ``wearing a long beard and a chauffeur's uniform,
with a peaked cap,'' the national news agency AIM reported.
   The warrant said Mandela, the underground leader of a newly
organized guerrilla campaign at the time, could be on his way to
Mozambique, South Africa's eastern neighbor.
   Mandela was captured by South African authorities in 1962 and
sentenced to life in prison for sabotage and plotting to overthrow
the white-led government. He was released in February.
   Mozambique gained independence from Portugal in 1975 and has
been governed for the last 15 years by the leftist FRELIMO party,
which supports Mandela's African National Congress. The ANC is the
leading black opposition group in South Africa and the guerrilla
movement is an arm of the group.
   ``The struggle of the ANC is our struggle,'' said Chissano, who
described Mandela as ``a man of peace.''
   Mandela said he would seek to end the violence in South Africa.
   ANC supporters have been locked in a power struggle with
Inkatha, a relatively conservative Zulu organization. Four years of
factional fighting in the eastern province of Natal has claimed
more than 4,000 lives.
   Also, right-wing whites have claimed responsibility for a recent
series of bomb attacks aimed at blacks and whites who oppose
apartheid.
   The violence threatens efforts by South African President F.W.
de Klerk to end white domination and negotiate a new constitution
that would give political rights to the country's 30 million black
majority.
   Mandela is to return to South Africa on Wednesday, his 72nd
birthday, and is expected to meet de Klerk soon afterward.
   Mandela's tour has raised millions of dollars for the ANC, which
is trying to establish itself as a major force inside South Africa
after being banned from 1960 until February.
   He also has helped convince foreign leaders to maintain economic
sanctions against South Africa despite de Klerk's reforms.
   Mozambique has been devastated by a 13-year-old civil war
pitting the government and against guerrillas who have been accused
of widespread atrocities. The South African government openly
supported the Mozambican guerrillas until the nations signed a
peace pact in 1984.
   The war has left Mozambique one of the world's poorest nations.
Annual per capita income is about $200 and almost half of the
country's 15 million people require some level of food assistance.

<HEAD>Senate Deciding Whether to Force Vote on Civil Rights Bill</HEAD>

   The Senate is deciding whether to force a vote
on civil rights legislation with critics still warning that it
would inevitably lead to racial and ethnic hiring quotas.
   Bargaining among the White House, bill sponsors and conservative
senators stretched into the early evening Monday but failed to
produce an agreement on the embattled civil rights bill.
   Provisions of the measure range from a ban on racial harassment
in the workplace to punitive damages for victims of discrimination.
   The most controversy has surrounded a provision that would
require employers to end practices shown to be statistically
discriminatory or prove in court that they were justified by
business necessity.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said talks over the
last three weeks have produced many areas of ``common ground
between the administration and the bill's proponents here in
Congress.''
   ``But this common ground is shaky ground, and it will collapse
if the bill's proponents do not show some willingness to address _
in very meaningful ways _ some very legitimate concerns raised by
the president and his advisers,'' Dole added.
   He said he favored a civil rights bill but could not accept the
version currently under debate.
   Meanwhile, Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, laid the
groundwork for a vote today on whether to limit debate to 30 hours.
It would take 60 votes to succeed in such a move.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and other sponsors have been
holding off on trying to force a vote while negotiating with the
administration.
   It appeared Friday that Kennedy and the administration might be
close to an agreement Friday and the Massachusetts senator said one
was likely this week. Before leaving for his Camp David retreat
Friday, President Bush said he was encouraged by the turn the talks
had taken.
   The bill is aimed at reversing five Supreme Court decisions last
year that civil rights forces say represented a severe setback for
their cause.
   Before last year's decision in the case of Wards Cove vs.
Antonio, involving hiring at a Salmon cannery in Alaska, it was up
to the employer to prove in court that a practice shown to be
discriminatory was a matter of business necessity and therefore
justified.
   The Wards Cove decision reversed that and said those filing
discrimination suits must prove that the practices involved were
not matters of business necessity.
   Kennedy's bill would place the burden back on the employer. But
critics say it would make it even easier to win a job
discrimination suit than before the Wards Cove decision. They say
employers would be guaranteed to turn to the use of quotas to
protect themselves from such suits.
   Business groups also are upset over a provision of the bill that
would allow courts to award punitive damages to victims of bias in
the workplace.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., on Monday introduced a proposed
compromise that appeared likely to gain support from lawmakers
holding out against the Kennedy version but wanting to prove that
they were not opponents of civil rights.
   Kassebaum said in a statement that her measure would reinstate
the legal language in use before the Wards Cove decision. She said
that provision ``forms an appropriate balance between the concerns
voiced on both sides _ avoiding quotas and excessive litigation
versus ensuring equal opportunity in the workplace.''
   She said her measure was designed ``to restore our civil rights
laws to the same strength and clarity that existed before a series
of Supreme Court decisions last year.''
   ``Those decisions have significantly increased the difficulty of
proving discrimination, and if they are allowed to stand, they will
weaken our civil rights laws,'' she said.
   She said the other goal of her bill was to ``maintain the
balance first struck by the 1964 Civil Rights Act and to preserve
the basic philosophy of conciliation, cooperation and equitable
relief that are the foundation of all of our civil rights laws.''

   Asian Games organizers holding a huge dress
rehearsal for the September competition found many small problems
with the new stadiums and a few unusual ones, including a vibrating
press box.
   Nearly 9,000 athletes, referees, police and officials took part
in the weekend rehearsal at all the games venues around Beijing.
   Scoreboards, telephones, toilets, lights, air conditioning,
parking, drug-testing facilities and emergency and security
procedures were tested as athletes held make-believe contests.
   Sixteen of the 36 sporting venues are newly built, and 11 others
have been renovated for the Sept. 22-Oct. 7 games. It will be
China's first major international sporting event.
   China Sports News said the basketball stadium leaked during
heavy weekend rainstorms, but did not say how serious the problem
was.
   At the Ditan Stadium, the paper said in its Monday editions,
journalists found their press box vibrated throughout the try-out.
   ``After half a day, their rear ends were numb, if not shaken to
pieces,'' the paper said. It turned out the stadium's air
conditioning equipment was installed under the press box.
   ``If the air conditioning is turned on (during the games),'' the
paper wrote, ``what will the foreign guests think?''
   Chinese reporters arriving at another stadium said none of the
guards could tell them where the press box was, and when they found
it, discovered there were no telephones.
   Other stadiums discovered they had too few entries and exits,
the paper said _ not commenting on how such a basic problem would
be resolved.

<HEAD>TV, Radio Stations Asked to Prove Compliance With FCC Political
Rules</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission will
examine information from 30 major market television and radio
stations asked to show that they are offering political candidates
the lowest possible advertising rates.
   The FCC on Monday began its first-ever audits of broadcasters,
prompted by what an agency news release called an ``obligation to
assure that broadcast stations are complying with political
programming laws and rules, especially in an election year.''
   The audits were not the result of any complaint, said Milton
Graves, chief of the FCC's political division.
   ``This is just a part of overseeing how the stations are
complying,'' he said. ``We want to know what their practices are.''
   The FCC sent field inspectors to stations in Cincinnati,
Dallas-Ft. Worth, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Portland, Ore. In
each city, they visited four television stations, an AM radio
station and an FM radio station.
   ``These cities were selected because they are geographically
diverse and also because, in some instances, the stations serve
more than one state,'' the FCC said.
   Inspectors asked the stations for political files for the 1990
elections, rate cards for political and commercial advertisers,
commercial invoices, program logs and statements from the stations
regarding pricing structures and methods of calculating ``lowest
unit'' charges for political candidates.
   They were given 20 days to send the FCC data on rates for
non-political advertisers but were asked to provide the political
information immediately, Graves said.
   He said auditors in the agency's Washington office will
``examine all the information that's provided to us.''
   Under FCC regulations, the lowest unit charge is available to
political candidates 45 days before primary balloting and six days
before a general election. Candidates may purchase single broadcast
advertisements for the same price as commercial advertisers who buy
a number of spots in the same time period.
   Graves said most of the field auditors completed their work
Monday but that their jobs were ``just the beginning'' of the
auditing process.
   Spokeswoman Briana Gowing said the action was an unusual one.
   ``Apparently the FCC has never before done anything like this
before,'' she said.
   The stations are:
   _Cincinnati: WCPO-TV, WKRC-TV, WLWL-TV, WIII-TV, WCKY-AM and
WWNK-FM.
   _Dallas: KDFW-TV, KXAS-TV, WFAA-TV, KTXA-TV, KRLD-AM and KPLX-FM.
   _Philadelphia: KYW-TV, WCAU-TV, WPVI-TV, WGBS-TV, WPEN-AM and
WWDB-FM.
   _Portland: KATU-TV, KGW-TV, KOIN-TV, KPTV-TV, KWJJ-AM and

<HEAD>U.N. Agency Halts Relief Food Distribution In Uganda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. relief agency has halted delivery
of emergency food in northeastern Uganda after unidentified gunmen
ambushed its convoy and killed a driver.
   Lee Tommi, the World Food Program representative in Uganda, said
the Rome-based organization would resume deliveries if the
government provides armed escorts into the arid region, where
people are reported dying of starvation.
   ``The situation is serious,'' Tommi said Monday. ``We talked to
the authorities and elders in Moroto and Kotido who reported that
at least 300 people have died of starvation in the past couple of
weeks.''
   Moroto and Kotido are trading towns about 310 miles from
Uganda's capital, Kampala. An estimated 220,000 people are
threatened with famine caused by drought, Tommi said.
   He said a driver was killed and two people hired as truck
loaders were injured in the July 7 ambush.
   New Vision newspaper described the gunmen as ``about 70 shabbily
dressed bandits.'' They stole the corn and burned two trucks. A
third truck escaped.
   Tommi said President Yoweri Museveni's government had not
officially appealed for emergency food, but that the World Food
Program decided to deliver 5,000 tons of corn. The operation began
in May and about 3,000 tons of the grain have since been delivered,
he said.
   ``This is a drop in the bucket,'' he said. ``It is hardly
enough. People are going without food for days.''
   In 1980, starvation caused by a severe drought killed thousands
of people in the same region, known as Karamonja.
   The region is also home to remnants of insurgencies that took up
arms against Museveni after he took power early 1986.

<HEAD>FDA Tells Manufacturers to Stop Making Health Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fish oil sellers are under orders from the
Food and Drug Administration to stop claiming their capsules can
help lower cholesterol and the chance of heart attacks.
   FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said the agency concluded after
consulting with the National Institutes of Health that, although
some studies have suggested fish oil might be useful for
cholesterol lowering, ``there wasn't sufficient evidence for them
to make these claims'' regarding the amount found in capsules.
   The letters sent to 60 fish oil capsule makers Monday are an
extension of an earlier FDA warning for them to stop claiming the
capsules were good for arthritis and other disorders. The companies
agreed with that, but argued that the cardiovascular benefits were
well-enough established to justify the claim.
   Several studies in recent years have suggested that fish oils
containing a component called omega-3, such as those from mackerel
and herring, can lower blood pressure and cholesterol, reduce
damage from inflammatory processes such as arthritis and lower the
chances of other problems such as diabetes and heart attacks.
   Grigg said the FDA agrees that ``there are studies that show
fish diets may be helpful.
   ``We said it's quite conceivable'' that further research might
justify an assertion that the capsules provide health benefits,
Grigg said.
   But such results are several months ``if not more'' down the
road, he added.
   It is the assertion of a health benefit that brings fish oil
capsules under stringent drug regulation rules. The manufacturers
can continue selling their capsules as foods without health claims
if the FAA accepts them as ``generally recognized as safe,'' Grigg
said.
   This might be a simple matter for some products, because ``for
cod-liver oil and some of the others, there is a good record,''
Grigg said.

   All but two of 13 studies conducted for
generic drug manufacturers by a Pittsburgh lab violated Food and
Drug Administration regulations or fell short of accepted
laboratory practice, the agency says.
   The lab, Biodecision Laboratories, promised to correct the flaws.
   FDA headquarters is analyzing the inspection reports to see
whether they affect any drugs recently approved or waiting for
approval, spokesman Don McLearn said Monday.
   He said he did not know what drugs were involved but noted that
``this is not a product issue, but how a lab conducts its
business.''
   Biodecision is one of the more heavily used laboratories in the
generic drug industry, McLearn said.
   The studies were so-called ``bioequivalence'' studies aimed at
showing that a candidate generic drug reaches the same
concentration in the bloodstream as the patented drug for which it
will be sold as a substitute.
   McLearn said an example of violation of standards of good
practice would be starting an analysis before validation of the
method being used.
   The agency can refuse to accept data from labs it deems
unreliable, but McLearn said the company ``is not in that kind of
jeopardy at this point.''
   The inspection was conducted in January and the company reported
its plans for corrective action in March. At some point, FDA
probably will approve or disapprove those plans, McLearn said.
   The agency has been wrestling with problems in the generic drug
industry for more than a year, with some drug manufacturers having
been found to have cheated on their lab tests and bribed FDA
officials.
   In Pittsburgh, a man answering the company's telephone who
identified himself as a guard said no one was available to comment.
   In Tuesday editions, The Washington Post quoted the company
president, Robert Lecher, as saying, ``We view the entire process
as very constructive and have taken it extremely seriously. We
don't take issue or disagree with any of the observations.''

   A major earthquake jolted Manila and
surrounding Luzon island on Monday, killing at least 193 people.
Hundreds more were reported trapped in collapsed buildings.
   The death toll, compiled by the Office of Civil Defense,
included some 80 people killed in the mountain resort of Baguio,
where four hotels were heavily damaged.
   Reports said nearly 1,000 people were believed trapped in
damaged buildings in the resort 110 miles north of Manila.
   Most of the Baguio victims, about 50, were at the Hyatt Hotel.
Aerial footage taken early Tuesday by private television station
GMA showed that the entire front section of the Hyatt, the city's
plushest hotel, had collapsed.
   It appeared that floors containing guest rooms had crashed down
onto the lobby, which includes the main restaurant, bar and shops.
   Baguio radio station DZWT said 23 people were killed when the
commerce building at the University of Baguio collapsed.
   Aftershocks continued Tuesday, and reporters in Baguio said most
of the 119,000 residents slept outdoors on the streets after the
quake, which struck about 4:30 p.m. and measured 7.7 on the Richter
scale.
   Officials said the worst affected areas were Nueva Ecija
province, which includes Cabanatuan, 60 miles north of Manila;
Baguio area; and Dagupan on Lingayen Gulf, about 100 miles north of
Manila.
   Manila TV stations said local officials were woefully short of
blood, medicine and rescue equipment in the nation's worst
earthquake in 14 years.
   President Corazon Aquino was meeting senators in her office when
the quake hit and she took cover under a table, said her spokesman,
Adolf Azcuna. She ordered the military to begin rescue operations
and closed schools throughout the area Tuesday. She flew early
Tuesday to Cabanatuan to inspect damage and console relatives of a
school disaster.
   Early Tuesday, hospitals said 35 people were killed in the
Cabanatuan area and 154 injured. Most casualties came from the
collapse of the six-story Philippine Christian College school in
the city of 80,000, but officials had no accurate breakdown because
of administrative confusion.
   Hundreds of students and staff were trapped in the collapse of
the school, which taught students from the first grade to senior
year in college. Cabanatuan is about 20 miles southeast of the
epicenter.
   The U.S. Embassy said Tuesday an official of the U.S. Agency for
International Development is missing and feared dead after the
quake heavily damaged the Nevada Hotel in Baguio, where he and
others were attending a symposium. The embassy refused to give his
name.
   U.S. officials said the Baguio injured were being transported to
American military hospitals at nearby Camp John Hay and Clark Air
Base.
   The State Department said earlier in Washington it was
investigating reports of deaths or injuries to American government
officials.
   Rescue efforts were hampered by poor communications and lack of
equipment.
   Landslides blocked roads to Baguio and the airport was closed
due to poor visibility and damage to the runway, officials said.
   The Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology recorded
70 aftershocks, measuring up to 3 on the Richter scale. Only 11
were felt by the public, the last at 5 a.m. Tuesday.
   The June 21 earthquake in Iran registered 7.3 to 7.7 and killed
at least 40,000 people.
   At least 150 people were believed trapped in the Hyatt Hotel in
Baguio, a favorite with foreign tourists. The military said 800
more were believed trapped in a government building in the Baguio
Export Processing Zone.
   The Pentagon said it provided an Air Force C-141 transport plane
to carry 16 civilian search and rescue personnel, four dogs and
support equipment to assist in the hunt for survivors.
   In Manila, which together with surrounding areas has a
population of about 8 million, numerous buildings were slightly
damaged and one fire broke out in the city's Santa Cruz district.
Two people were killed. Thousands were sent fleeing into the
streets. Filipinos prayed or made signs of the cross.
   The temblor cracked walls and broke windows in many buildings,
including the downtown ticket office of Philippine Airlines and The
Manila Hotel, a luxury hotel on Manila Bay from which hundreds of
guests were evacuated.
   Much of the city was without power Monday night. Stop lights
were knocked out of service, causing huge traffic jams.
   Most of the casualties were reported in the densely populated
areas north of the capital in central Luzon, the country's
agricultural heartland.
   One 14-year-old survivor at Cabanatuan, Loida Gabwat, a high
school sophomore, screamed after being pulled from the rubble:
``Mommy, mommy, come here! I can't go through this alone! My
friends are dead inside!''
   Hours after the quake, hundreds of relatives and friends watched
as volunteer rescuers dug through the wreckage; hope for survivors
faded.
   Ms. Gabwat, 14, said her class had just finished a math exam
when the quake struck.
   ``We were kidding each other, we were saying the test was so
easy,'' she said. ``Then suddenly, the walls trembled, the ceiling
collapsed and there was total darkness. We embraced each other. We
were very scared.''
   A 7.8 quake struck the Philippines in 1976, killing 8,000
people. Most died in a tidal wave that struck Mindanao.

<HEAD>Auto Safety Group Asks For Chrysler Recall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An auto safety group wants the government to
investigate and recall 5.5 million Chrysler cars and vans after 76
reports of vehicles moving into gear while their transmissions were
in park.
   The Center for Auto Safety said in a letter to National Highway
Traffic Safety Administrator Jerry Curry on Monday that two people
had been killed and 20 injured in accidents involving the problem
with several Chrysler models from 1981 to 1989.
   NHTSA spokesman Tim Hurd said the agency had just received the
letter and would review it before deciding whether to open an
investigation.
   James Kenyon, spokesman for Chrysler Corp., said the company was
not aware of any problem with the models cited in the petition. He
said the company had not seen the complaint, which was sent first
to members of the news media.
   The center, which describes itself as an independent consumer
group formed in 1970 to improve vehicle and highway safety, said
its petition covers 1981-89 Dodge Aries and Plymouth Reliants;
1982-87 Dodge 400s and Chrysler LeBarons; 1983-88 Dodge 600s,
Plymouth Caravelles and Chrysler New Yorkers; and 1984-89 Dodge
Caravans and Plymouth Voyagers.

<HEAD>Pan Am Threat Not Considered Credible</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration informed
airlines of a threat against Pan Am in Europe but did not consider
the threat credible, an FAA spokesman says.
   ``The FAA routinely issues information to U.S. carriers to put
into perspective rumors, news reports and other information that
may be based on erroneous information or speculation,'' spokesman
Fred Farrar said Monday.
   Such a circular was issued July 12, he said, without describing
its contents.
   A London newspaper, the Sunday Correspondent, reported Sunday
that U.S. authorities had warned airlines of a threat to blow up a
Pan Am jet on a flight from West Germany in the next 10 days.
   The supposed threat involved a female student with a Canadian
passport who was to be duped into carrying a suitcase containing a
bomb on a Pan Am flight from either Frankfurt or Berlin.
   Farrar said information about the threat had been circulating
for several months among news organizations in Europe.
   The FAA cautioned that doubts existed about the information and
advised airlines that the agency did not consider it a credible
threat, he said.

<HEAD>Stigma of Mass Child Sex Abuse in Rural Coal Country Won't Go Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROB WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALYERSVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This impoverished town in the eastern
Kentucky coalfields was shocked when 23 men and women were indicted
four years ago for sexually and physically abusing more than two
dozen children.
   Four trials have come and gone and a fifth opens this week, but
the unwelcome spotlight of the nation's media has dimmed.
Nevertheless, for some residents the stigma is proving hard to bear.
   ``We'll never live it down,'' said Sheriff Chalmer Wireman.
   Investigators concluded that 26 children ranging in age from 1
to 11 had been abused. The accused included their fathers,
grandfathers, uncles and mothers, and charges ranged from rape and
sodomy to torture with burning cigarettes.
   Nineteen of the defendants were members of an extended family
supported largely by work as low-income laborers.
   One defendant was convicted, eight others pleaded guilty and
five won acquittals. None of the victimized children was returned
home and 10 have either been adopted by new families or have
adoptions pending.
   Impoverished living conditions common in an area with 20 percent
unemployment came to light at the recent trial of Herbert ``Hub''
Gipson when his 12-year-old son testified that he fabricated tales
of abuse ``because I wanted to live in a better place.'' Gipson was
acquitted.
   Despite the five acquittals, Assistant Attorney General Barbara
Whaley says she thinks prosecutors have excelled because winning
convictions in child sexual abuse cases is among the hardest of
legal tasks.
   Medical evidence and witnesses to confirm child allegations are
frequently lacking, and the pressures of court testimony on alleged
child victims makes pursuing such cases difficult, said Ms. Whaley,
a special prosecutor assigned to the case.
   Children recanted in Gipson's trial, she said, because ``it's
almost impossible to ask those kids to come in here.''
   Gipson, an unemployed former tobacco farmer with a seventh-grade
education, had been charged with eight felony counts for allegedly
sexually abusing three of his children and a cousin.
   Gipson thinks the acquittal will enable him to clear his name,
but said the 3{-year wait for trial was an ordeal.
   ``It hurts and everything ... getting jobs and things like
that,'' he said. The investigation began in August 1986 when state
police and social workers interviewed a young incest victim. The
case snowballed when the child said other youngsters had been
molested.
   Seventeen of the original 23 cases have been resolved. Brack
Nickles, 64, of Mason's Creek, received the maximum sentence of 20
years after being found guilty last summer of rape and sodomy.
   The eight defendants who pleaded guilty to various misdemeanor
and felony counts have all received probation. Three cases ended
when one man died, one woman's charges were dismissed, and
prosecutors realized that one person named didn't actually exist.
   In the next trial, scheduled to begin Thursday, 27-year-old
Della Adkins is charged with three felony child abuse counts for
allegedly acting as an accomplice in the molestations of two girls
and a boy.
   Some local residents defended the accused and about 50 rallied
in front of the county courthouse in November 1986 to demand
charges be dropped and that children be returned to their families.
   But now many are eager to forget.
   ``I'd say it's just fading away, except for the damage that's
done to a few kids,'' said Jim Wadges, an unemployed millwright.

   A new astronaut on track to
becoming NASA's first female shuttle commander said she welcomes
the Bush administration's scrutiny of the beleaguered agency.
   The administration on Monday ordered a review by outside experts
of the nation's long-term space goals, the same day the astronaut
candidate class of 1990 reported to work for the first time.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has endured a
spate of recent embarrassments, including trouble with the $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope and hydrogen leaks that have
grounded the space shuttle fleet.
   Air Force Maj. Eileen Collins, one of 23 new astronauts selected
earlier this year, told reporters she is not unnerved by problems
with sophisticated machines. The new astronauts were chosen from
more than 2,000 applicants.
   ``There are high points and low points in any airplane or weapon
system,'' Ms. Collins said Monday. ``You learn to get through the
bad times.''
   ``If our president feels it's something that needs to be done,
it needs to be done,'' she said.
   If all goes according to plan, Ms. Collins would become the
first woman to command a shuttle mission. She said she hopes to be
flying shuttle missions to help construct the planned space station
Freedom.
   The candidates will become full-fledged astronauts a year from
now, after undergoing advanced training and evaluation. In the
history of the program, only one candidate has dropped out during
this last leg, officials said.
   An assignment on a space shuttle would probably take at least
two years after that.
   Besides the seven pilots, the 1990 class includes 16 mission
specialists. Eleven of the 23 are civilians and 12 are military
pilots.
   Of the five women selected, three are military officers,
including Ms. Collins. The class also includes Ellen Ochoa, of Los
Altos, Calif., the first Hispanic woman to be selected.

   The nation's first program allocating state
money to poor parents so their children can attend private schools
is nearing its autumn startup, but critics are planning a
last-ditch effort to block it.
   The school choice plan, which has drawn praise from the Bush
administration and Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, faces a court
hearing this month that could determine its immediate fate.
   The hearing is the result of a lawsuit, urged by state School
Superintendent Herbert Grover and filed by opponents of the plan,
that challenges the constitutionality of using state money for
private schools.
   The Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to immediately review the
lawsuit and referred it to Dane County Circuit Court, which has
scheduled a July 28 hearing.
   If the court blocks the program, it will start a legal battle
that will probably delay implementation.
   ``The arguments they're making amount to grasping at
constitutional straws,''said Clint Bolick, spokesman for the
Landmark Legal Foundation Center, a Washington-based advocacy group
assisting in the fight against the lawsuit.
   Even if they win the court battle, program organizers still face
a battle with Grover over requirements for the 10 private schools
that have applied to accept the students. That battle has prompted
a second lawsuit challenging Grover's authority.
   Plans that allow parents more choice over where to send their
children to school have gained momentum in the last five years.
   Minnesota and Iowa were among the first to offer tax credits to
parents sending their children to private schools. Wisconsin's
voucher system would be the nation's first to directly provide
government money for the purpose.
   The program was approved by the Legislature in April and signed
into law by Thompson. It has been hailed by Bush administration
officials as a national model for overhauling public education.
   It provides as much as $2,500 to each of nearly 1,000 poor
Milwaukee students to help them leave the public schools and enroll
in non-sectarian private schools. The average yearly tuition at the
private schools is $3,200.
   The experiment would affect about the poorest 1 percent of the
city's estimated 97,000 students. The money used would be deducted
from the city's school budget.
   Critics such as Grover and the Wisconsin Education Association
Council teachers union claim the plan undermines public education
and puts students in private schools that aren't fully accountable
to the state.
   Grover devised a series of forms for the schools to complete
before they would be allowed to participate. Two of the schools
completed the forms. The others refused and filed a lawsuit
claiming the forms were too complex and would force the schools to
meet numerous requirements not specified in the law.
   ``None of these schools are capable of providing those kinds of
services,'' said attorney William Levit, who represents the private
schools. ``The city of Milwaukee doesn't even provide them on a
school-by-school basis. The district provides them.''

   Loida Gabwat's class had
just finished a math test when the earth shook, bringing her
six-story school down in crumbling concrete on hundreds of students
and teachers.
   ``We were kidding each other, we were saying the test was so
easy,'' said the 14-year-old. ``Then suddenly, the walls trembled,
the ceiling collapsed and there was total darkness. We embraced
each other. We were very scared.''
   Survivors groped for one another in the darkened rubble and
prayed aloud.
   ``We were calling out our classmates' names but they did not
respond any more,'' Miss Gabwat told a reporter while being taken
to a provincial hospital. ``Then we groped for their hands but felt
that they were cold. Each time, we wept.
   ``We were scared and some were screaming. But then later on,
they said they wanted to sleep already and rest. Then there was
silence.''
   Ms. Gabwat lost so many of her friends.
   ``Mommy, mommy, come here!'' she had screamed when she was
pulled from the rubble of the Christian College of the Philippines
after Monday's quake. ``I can't go through this alone! My friends
are dead inside!''
   Mayor Honorato Perez said about 50 people remained buried today
in the rubble of the school _ which included first grade through
the senior year of college _ but fewer than half were believed
still alive.
   The quake was centered 20 miles northwest of Cabanatuan, a city
of 80,000 people.
   The rescue efforts that followed were undertaken largely by
local volunteers. There was little sign of experienced supervision.
   President Corazon Aquino flew to Cabanatuan from Manila early
today to console families and visit survivors.
   While she was present, a rescuer crawled from the rubble and
told reporters he found four boys, all alive. But he said one was
pinned under the ruins, in such pain he amputated his own leg with
a jagged piece of concrete.
   Lt. Benbol Moralde, part of an army contingent sent from nearby
Fort Magsaysay, said he believed few remained alive beneath the
debris.
   Moralde said victims' cries grew fainter and fainter and that he
could see bodies and parts of bodies when he surveyed the
destruction.
   Hours after the temblor, hundreds of family members and friends
watched and prayed as rescuers dug through the school rubble.
   Each time someone was brought out alive, relatives crowded
around the survivor, begging for news of those still missing.
   ``They told me she's still alive,'' said Rosa de los Reyes, who
was waiting word of her daughter, Maria Lisa, 14. ``I'm very happy
but if it turns out she has died, I think I'm going to die too.''
   Throughout the night, boys as young as seven scrambled between
slabs of concrete carrying water to victims still trapped.
Sixteen-year-old Florencio Alano crawled through the wreckage
looking for his 13-year-old brother, Cesario _ only to find out he
was dead.
   Florencio, who eventually led three survivors to safety, said:
``At first I couldn't believe that he was already dead. So I
crawled through the passageway. I saw his face and felt him. What
else can one feel but just accept it.''
   Rescuers could hear the anguished screams during the night of
those buried under tons of debris. Most begged for water. One girl
shrieked for rescuers to ``cut off my legs'' to free her.
   Cenando Memping, whose 14th birthday was Monday, said he had
just invited his three best friends to join him after class at a
restaurant when the quake hit.
   Cenando and his friends were trapped beneath tons of rubble. He
said there were 54 students in his class. More than 10 hours after
the quake, he was the only one of them who had been rescued.
   ``I prayed to God that if I survive, I'll hear Mass every day,''
he said from his hospital bed. He said his friend Michael Nuevo
joked that he would never go to a ``high'' school again.
   Moments later, Michael died, Cenando said.
   ``We were kidding each other, comforting each other,'' Cenando
said softly. ``Then suddenly, he stopped breathing. He said,
`Praise the Lord. Our Father, Our Father, Our Father.' Then he was
silent.''

<HEAD>Faulty Speaker System Adds To Confusion In Empire State Building
Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The speaker system at the Empire State Building
may have been faulty when a smoky fire erupted halfway up the
102-story landmark, forcing many of the 1,000 people inside to seek
their own way out.
   ``Some people said they heard the alarms, others said they
didn't. But we get that in every fire,'' said Fire Department
spokesman John Mulligan. ``There's a speaker system and we are
investigating to see how well it worked.''
   At least four civilians and 34 firefighters were hurt, mostly
from inhaling smoke, in the Monday evening fire, Mulligan said. The
blaze was confined to four unoccupied offices on the 51st floor,
but smoke spread throughout the upper floors.
   Sixteen people were sent to hospitals for treatment. A
firefighter who suffered minor burns was the only one to be
hospitalized.
   About 1,000 people evacuated the building down the stairways and
elevators, said Fire Department Capt. Charles Kasper. Although
10,000 people work in the building, more than 80 percent of them
leave the building at 5 p.m., officials said.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately known. ``We are trying
to find out now who was the last person in the room,'' Mulligan
said.
   ``There were nothing but tourists up there and there were no
announcements,'' said Josephine Danielson of New York, who was on
the observation deck with five friends from Spain. ``No one really
knew what was going on, not even the employees.''
   ``We started smelling smoke and we saw on the east side of the
building dense black smoke coming from below the tower,'' said
Danielson, a Pan Am stewardess. ``Whoever runs the observation deck
is tremendously unorganized. You would think they would have had
some kind of recorded announcement.''
   Paula Schnorbus of Hoboken, N.J., who was on the observation
deck with her boyfriend Stephen Giradi, also complained that
``there was no one up there to tell us where to go.''
   Tourists who stayed on the observation deck were eventually
evacuated, by elevator, 15 at a time. The last civilian came out at
about 10:20 p.m., Mulligan said.
   The fire was reported at 6:30 p.m., and by 8:45 p.m., the blaze
was out and the danger passed, fire officials said.
   Nabila Al Riyami, a tourist from Oman, emerged from the building
at about 9:15 p.m. with her husband and five children.
   ``Some people were crying and having nervous, trembling fits,''
she said. Her husband, Said, added: ``We were praying to God that
he would help us. We are safe and we thank the fire department of
the municipality.''
   Fire Department officials reported heavy fire damage on the 51st

   Hundreds of Lucy and Desi wanna-bes, hoping
to play the comedy duo in a television movie, flooded CBS
Television City with red hair and broken English as a nationwide
casting search began.
   The Desi Arnaz warning, ``you gotta lotta splainin' to do,'' got
a workout Monday before a producer and a casting director who
smiled cheerfully through some painfully amateurish readings.
   One truth seemed evident: The more the performers looked like
Lucy and Desi, the worse their acting was.
   Some women dyed their hair red for their slim chance to be in
``Lucy and Desi: Before the Laughter.'' A few men wore white suits.
Most every fake Lucy wore a 1950s-style dress and heels. Several
looked just like the zany comedian, while others bore more of a
resemblance to Carol Burnett.
   One couple danced the rumba while waiting for their names to be
called.
   ``What are my chances? Not great. There are like tons of people
here,'' said Randy Aguirre, an engineer who missed a staff meeting
to audition for the part of the Cuban band leader.
   A woman named Tahoe Castle (``I was born there'') died her hair
red and drove 300 miles for a stab at the lead role.
   ``It's just a rinse so I can wash it right out,'' she said,
fingering her tresses. For her shot at stardom, Castle performed a
song from the musical ``A Chorus Line'' as Lucy might have
interpreted it.
   ``I feel like I'm really her,'' said Castle, who came from San
Martin in Northern California to be one of the first in line. ``I
watch all of her old shows.''
   Castle also planned a trip to Disneyland as part of her Southern
California visit.
   The CBS movie will cover the late Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz's
life from when they met in 1940 while making the movie ``Too Many
Girls,'' to 1951, the year television's ``I Love Lucy'' premiered.
   ``I'd like to play her, but it's so hard to fill her shoes,''
said Dianalynn Pfennig, who drove from her makeover salon in San
Jose to perform Lucy's famous drunken sales pitch for the
alcohol-laced Vita Meta Vegamin nutritional supplement.
   In addition to false eyelashes and the heavy makeup she'd been
wearing since 2 a.m., Pfennig brought a stage prop: a bottle of
multivitamin liquid extract from which she drank during her
two-minute monologue.
   ``This stuff tastes awful,'' she said after her performance.
   Her audition was scarcely the most offbeat.
   One Desi gave a stream-of-consciousness monologue, Ricky Ricardo
as scripted by Hunter S. Thompson. One actress' audition consisted
entirely of her impression on how Lucy would eat a crumb.
   A few Lucy simulations came from as far away as Dallas and El
Paso. The first Lucy in line arrived at 3 a.m. after finishing her
shift as a waitress at a late-night restaurant.
   Tony Rael, who was born in Havana and came to the United States
when he was 2, was one of the few the producers wanted to see
again. He sang the show's theme song for his tryout.
   ``I love Desi Arnaz,'' Rael said. ``He's a hero to the Hispanic
people.''
   Producer Larry Thompson said the television movie, due to be
broadcast next February, will be a ``loving but honest portrayal''
of the relationship between Lucy and Desi.
   He deflected criticism from daughter Lucie Arnaz, who said, ``I
believe that the climate is wrong to try and tell my parents' story
accurately no matter who tells it.''
   CBS Entertainment President Jeff Sagansky said: ``We're not
going to desecrate all the wonderful things Lucy and Desi did for
CBS.''

<TEXT>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics is advising
that babies should be vaccinated three months earlier than
previously recommended against a disease that causes meningitis and
pneumonia.
   The 39,000-doctor academy is recommending that children be
vaccinated at 15 months against the disease hemophilus influenzae
type b rather than at 18 months, the academy said in a news release
Monday.
   The academy said its Committee on Infectious Diseases revised
the position after reviewing data on 15-month-old children who had
been vaccinated.
   Before immunizations against the disease were introduced, there
were about 16,000 cases a year in this country among children 5
years of age or younger. More than 9 percent of the cases occurred
among children 15 months to 17 months old.
   The vaccine recommendation was published in the July issue of
the American Academy of Pediatrics News.

<BYLINE>Government Extradites Two Accused Drug Smugglers To U.S.
^By STEVEN GUTKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a move sure to anger cocaine bosses,
the Colombian government has extradited to the United States two
more men accused of drug trafficking, one a native Texan, police
say.
   Both were sent to the United States on Monday night, bringing to
19 the number of suspects extradited since August, when the
government declared war on cocaine traffickers.
   President-elect Cesar Gaviria promised Monday to fight poverty
in Medellin slums, where drug traffickers are hiring teen-agers as
assassins in their war to stop extraditions, the fate they fear
most.
   The Texas native extradited was identified as Eduard George
Mitchell, a U.S. citizen wanted on drug smuggling charges in
Wisconsin.
   The other suspect, Jose Gil Zapata, is a Colombian charged in a
Florida court with cocaine trafficking, a police spokesman said in
a telephone interview.
   Gil Zapata was arrested on Jan. 15 in Medellin, headquarters of
the Medellin cocaine cartel, the spokesman said.
   Mitchell, 44, was arrested in northern Colombia on Jan. 22.
   No further details were given on the arrests.
   Eleven other drug smuggling suspects are still in Colombian
jails awaiting extradition to the United States.
   The government of President Virgilio Barco reinstated the
nation's extradition policy in August after drug traffickers were
blamed for murdering a leading presidential candidate, Luis Carlos
Galan.
   The policy is not popular in Colombia, where many believe
sending citizens to be tried in a foreign country is an insult to
national pride.
   Many drug bosses have been able to bribe or threaten their way
out of Colombian jails.
   One of the main cities where the drug traffickers are carrying
on their bombing and murder campaign against the government
crackdown is Medellin, home of the drug cartel by the same name.
   Drug barons often hire teen-agers from Medellin's poor
neighborhoods to carry out their campaigns of bombings and
assassinations, authorities say.
   An estimated 3,000 people have been murdered in the city this
year, including about 1,50 police officers. With 2 million people,
Medellin is Colombia's second-largest city after the capital.
   Gaviria, who becomes Colombia's next president on Aug. 7, said
at a news conference in Bogota that the government will have to
attack Medellin's poverty if it hopes to make a dent in
drug-related violence.
   ``The country's gravest problem now is violence in Medellin, and
this will require special treatment from my government, a treatment
that transcends just military, police and public order measures,''
Gaviria said in his first public appearance since returning Sunday
from Europe, the United States and Venezuela. He met with President
Bush during his trip to Washington last week.
   He also said the drug raids now taking place in northeastern
Colombia have not been a failure, as suggested in many news reports.
   Last week about 2,000 policemen and soldiers began combing the
area in search of Pablo Escobar, reputed head of the Medellin
cocaine cartel.
   Police said they had Escobar surrounded, but the fugitive drug
lord managed to slip away for the third time in a year.

<TEXT>
   The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo today, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange firmed
on arbitrage buying.
   The dollar closed at 148.20 yen, down 0.23 yen from Monday's
close of 148.43 yen. It opened at 147.87 yen and ranged between
147.80 yen and 148.30 yen.
   Spot transactions totaled $8.568 billion, up from $7.959 billion
on Monday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 150.55
points, or 0.46 percent, to 33,172.28. The index surged 377.36
points on Monday.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 600 million shares,
up from Monday's 580 million shares.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond stood at 86.87 points as of 5 p.m., down
from Monday's close of 87.06 points. The yield was 7.225 percent,
up from 7.185 percent.
   Currency dealers said movement of the dollar was narrow before
the release in Washington of U.S. trade data later in the day.
   ``Dealers' sentiment here generally favors the dollar to slip
further'' because of Friday's cut in the U.S. key federal funds
rate, among other factors, said Akihiko Kagawa, a dealer with Bank
of Tokyo.
   On the stock market, traders said share prices moved higher on
arbitrage buying in the day's closing minutes of trade.
   Yoshiro Inoue of Nomura Securities said share prices opened
firm, aided by a steep overnight advance on Wall Street, and
transactions were brisk in early trading before a rumor hit the
market that Japan's central bank would raise its key rate for loans
to commercial banks near in the future.
   Japan's discount rate now stands at 5.25 percent, one of the
lowest among industrialized nations. The country has been under
pressure from its trading partners to raise the rate to stem the
yen's weakness against the dollar and other major currencies.
   Higher interest rates tend to make a currency more attractive to
investors on the one hand, but make security investment less
attractive on the other hand.
   In the last few minutes of the day's trading the benchmark
Nikkei index shot up on buying linked to stock-index arbitrage,
Inoue said. In the arbitrage, traders bought shares coupled to a
short sale of the same securities to profit from a disparity of
prices, he said.

<TEXT>
   Rebels have redoubled their efforts to
take the capital, and frightened residents are streaming out of the
city on the last open road in search of food and safety, witnesses
say.
   The fighting has cut off food supply routes and public
utilities, and the witnesses said Monday that food shortages had
worsened.
   Gunfire was heard in Monrovia, but there were no details on the
battles. Heavy fighting was reported Sunday just east of this city
of about 400,000.
   Hundreds of refugees have been fleeing, and on Monday they
converged on the only road still reported open.
   A high government official, who said he had been held captive by
the rebels for two weeks, said they were murdering members of
President Samuel Doe's Krahn tribe as well as the allied Mandingos.
   ``It was sheer anarchy,'' the official said of what he had seen
during his captivity. ``Every house is opened and looted of the
cars and food in it. When they see your house, they chase you out
with your family. If you resist, they kill you.''
   The official spoke on condition of anonymity. It was not clear
how he gained his freedom.
   He said he understood that the rebel leader, former Doe aide
Charles Taylor, was trying to prevent such abuses.
   Human rights groups have accused both sides of killing hundreds
of civilians in the war, which has been fought along largely tribal
lines.
   The government official said the rebels were demanding food and
lodging from civilians. He said they were executing those who
refused.
   Witnesses have made similar charges about Doe's forces.
   The rebel National Patriotic Front of Liberia began its
insurgency in December, accusing Doe of corruption and rights
violations.
   Since then, its ranks have swelled from only a few hundred men
into the thousands, and the rebels have captured most of the
country.
   Most diplomats believe Doe cannot hold out against the
insurgents' 2-week-old onslaught on the capital.
   The United States has posted 2,000 Marines on ships offshore,
saying they might be needed to protect American lives.
   The government is operating with a skeleton staff, with only
four of 21 ministers remaining. Officials acknowledged Monday that
the army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Charles Julu, has fled the
country.
   He was reported to be in the United States.
   The West African nation has strategic importance for the United
States.
   It is the base for all diplomatic messages to and from U.S.
missions in Africa. There is a huge Voice of America transmission
station outside Monrovia, and the country also has a powerful
transmitter responsible for guiding all U.S. shipping in the
Atlantic.
   Doe took power in a 1980 coup that ousted the elitist
descendants of freed American slaves who founded this nation in
1847. Liberia now has 2 million people.
   The United States has offered to escort Doe from the country.
The rebels have said they will not lay down their arms unless he
leaves, and peace talks in neighboring Sierre Leone have broken
down.

<TEXT>
   Rite Aid Corp. and its president have been
acquitted on charges of bribing a member of Ohio's pharmacy board
in an effort to fill his job with someone more favorable to the
drugstore chain.
   Prosecutors contended that Rite Aid President Martin L. Grass,
36, gave Board of Pharmacy member Melvin Wilczynski a $33,000
company check to get him to resign. The company wanted to push its
own member into the job, they said.
   But when the prosecution rested its case Monday, two weeks into
the trial, Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Lillian Greene
granted a defense motion for acquittal.
   The judge said prosecution evidence was circumstantial and did
not prove any willful intent to bribe.
   The ruling was met by courtroom applause. Supporters hugged the
smiling Grass or shook his hand.
   ``I never had a doubt. It was a ridiculous prosecution,'' Grass
said.
   Grass and Rite Aid, based in Shiremanstown, Pa., were charged in
an indictment unsealed in August with bribery and possession of
criminal tools, described as a corporate aircraft.
   Assistant County Prosecutor William Caine refused to comment.
   Wilczynski, 61, said he was offered a Rite Aid check for just
over $33,000, plus ongoing insurance benefits.
   Rite Aid's lawyers claimed the payment was a legal buyout of
Wilczynski's consulting contract for another drug store company,
Lane Drug Co., a division of Peoples Drug Stores Inc. acquired by
Rite Aid last year.
   Wilczynski testified that Grass offered the buyout only if he
would step down as a voting member of the board.
   Prosecutors said Rite Aid had complained that the pharmacy board
harassed the company when enforcing state regulations over
drugstores.
   But defense attorneys argued that the board had a vendetta
against Rite Aid because the company challenged some rules and
decisions that it thought unreasonable.
   The prosecutors had the jury hear and watch two secretly-made
tapes _ a recorded telephone conversation between Wilczynski and
Grass on April 26, 1989, and a videotape the following day in a
Cleveland hotel room.
   In the telephone tape, Wilczynski is heard arranging the
following-day meeting with Grass at the hotel to discuss the
contract buyout.
   In the videotape, Wilczynski and Grass are seen in the motel
room, leafing through papers, some of which Wilczynski signs.
Prosecutors said the papers included six undated letters of
resignation.
   Wilczynski remains a voting member of the pharmacy board.
   The bribery charge carried a maximum 10-year prison sentence and
a fine of up to $5,000.

   Thunderstorms moved across the northern Plains and Great Lakes
region today, but fair weather prevailed over much of the rest of
the nation.
   A disturbance that brought heavy rain to New Mexico and Texas
over the weekend was expected to linger over the western Gulf of
Mexico.
   Showers fell over southern Texas early today, and the Atlantic
coastline from Florida to the Carolinas was overcast. Thunderstorms
rumbled through the Dakotas and northern Michigan, and a cool front
was expected to trigger more storms later in the day.
   Today's forecast also calls for thunderstorms to spread eastward
from Texas into Louisiana. Dry weather is expected in the northern
Rockies, Pacific Northwest and the central Plains, and warm air
moving into the East will ward off the threat of showers between
the Ohio Valley and the Northeast.
   Flash floods were likely in the desert Southwest.
   The nation's high for Monday was 107 degrees at Yuma, Ariz.

<HEAD>Dollar Generally Lower in Europe, Gold Also Weaker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was generally lower in calm European
trading late this morning as the market waited for the release of
two key U.S. indicators for guidance on the currency's next move.
   Gold prices were weaker in moderate dealings.
   Traders said U.S. trade figures for May and industrial
production figures for June may push the dollar out of its current
tight range.
   The trade deficit is expected to have widened to $7.7 billion in
May from $6.94 billion in April, while industrial production is
forecast to rise 0.2 percent in June following a 0.6 percent rise
in May.
   If the indicators don't provide a strong clue about the U.S.
economy, dealers said the market will be waiting for Wednesday's
congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
for a further indication of U.S. monetary policy.
   The dollar fell after Greenspan's comments last week indicating
that a modest easing in U.S. credit policy might be necessary.
   ``The performance of the dollar in the last few days hasn't been
bad when you consider the reaction after the Greenspan comments
last week,'' said Jochen Zimmermann, chief trader at Berliner Bank
AG in Frankfurt.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.23 yen to a closing 148.20 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 148.17 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.6515 West German marks, down from 1.6535
   _1.4165 Swiss francs, unchanged
   _5.5373 French francs, down from 5.5460
   _1.8653 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8640
   _1,209.50 Italian lire, down from 1,210.75
   _1.1573 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1587
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, which was
quoted at $1.8075, compared with $1.8040 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $360.90 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended
price of $361.30. Both were down from $362.75 bid late Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $361.00, down from $362.70 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.25 to close at a bid $361.86.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $4.85 a troy ounce, from
Monday's $4.89.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge sentenced a wealthy
pro-Israel activist to 90 days in prison for making an illegal
$120,000 campaign contribution to aid the re-election of Alan
Cranston in the 1986 Senate race.
   ``You must be made an example,'' U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W.
Lew told Michael Goland during sentencing Monday. ``There must be
deterrence.''
   Goland, 43, was convicted of a misdemeanor charge of making the
illegal contribution in the tight race between Cranston and his
Republican challenger, Ed Zschau of Los Altos.
   Goland was accused of paying for a $120,000 television
advertisement for American Independent Party candidate Ed Vallen to
help split the conservative vote between he and Zschau to aid
Cranston, who is considered liberal.
   Cranston is a long-time supporter of Israel and Goland felt
Zschau might be less supportive of continued aid for the Middle
East nation. The candidates were not implicated in the case.
Cranston beat Zschau by about 100,000 votes.
   The contribution was illegal because the commercial claimed it
was financed by the Vallen for Senate Committee, a group that did
not exist, and it failed to note Goland was the actual backer,
prosecutors said.
   Goland was acquitted of three felony counts, including
conspiracy and making a false statement to a federal agency.

activist calls himself a ``modern-day Johnny Appleseed.''
   ``Instead of planting (tree) seeds, I plant seeds of
consciousness,'' Storch said. ``Everybody has to work together.
Around the world, efforts are being made to clean up and save our
planet.''
   Wary of water-born germs, Storch said he had been inoculated
against hepatitis. ``There are all kinds of dangers out there,'' he
said, adding that he would wear a bodysuit to protect against the
cold.
   Storch, a recreation director from Spring Valley, N.Y., swam to
New London, Conn., where he stopped for the night.
   A boat carrying volunteer supporters will accompany him on the
trip.
   The chilly water ``sapped most of my energy in the first two
hours,'' Storch said. He plans to swim about 17 miles a day and end
the week at the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor.
   Twenty million people live, work or play on or near the sound,
swim organizers said. The waterway extends from New York Harbor to
the southwestern tip of Rhode Island.
   Herm Hannah of the Long Island Sound Taskforce said it once was
an important commercial fishing area where beachgoers could take a
dip without getting a booster shot first.
   ``Unfortunately, it has also been a dumping ground,'' Hannah
said. ``Skip Storch is going to highlight the good things he sees
and try to make us very much aware what needs to be done to keep
this sound clean and usable.''
   Terry Backer of the Long Island Soundkeeper Fund said ignoring
cleanup efforts could be costly.
   ``The coastal environment for Rhode Island, Connecticut and New
York is the source of billions of dollars of revenue,'' he said.
``When people feel (the waters are) open sewers ... we're going to
lose that revenue.''
   It wasn't the first time Storch has embarked on a long swim to
heighten awareness about water pollution.
   Last summer he swam from Atlantic City, N.J., to New York Harbor
and the summer before he swam down the Hudson River from Albany,
N.Y., to the Statue of Liberty.

   ``Die Hard 2'' stayed atop the box office
ratings, but ``Ghost'' conjured up more dollars per screen while
debuting in less than half as many theaters.
   ``Die Hard 2'' grossed $14.5 million over the weekend, becoming
only the second film this summer, after ``Dick Tracy,'' to lead for
two consecutive weeks. The Bruce Willis tough guy-vs.-terrorists
flick has now made $60.7 million.
   ``Ghost,'' a romantic drama starring Demi Moore and Patrick
Swayze, was second with receipts of $12.2 million, but the film
opened on just 1,101 screens, fewer than half as many as ``Die Hard
2.''
   Its ticket sales of $11,073 per screen was the third-best
per-theater average of the season, behind the far more expensive
and heavily hyped ``Total Recall'' and ``Back to the Future Part
III.''
   ``Days of Thunder,'' with Tom Cruise as a race-car driver whose
smile is as winning as his automobile, was in third place and
continuing to do strong business with $8.2 million.
   The re-release of the 1967 animated film ``Jungle Book'' was
fourth on a gross of $7.7 million.
   ``The Adventures of Ford Fairlane,'' starring raunchy comedian
Andrew Dice Clay, was fifth in a somewhat limited release. It
collected $6.4 million in its first weekend, or $5,120 per screen
in 1,245 theaters.
   ``Dick Tracy'' was sixth with $4.8 million, followed by Bill
Murray's latest, ``Quick Change.'' The comedy about a bank robber
grossed $4.7 million in a weak debut.
   Arnold Schwarzenegger's ``Total Recall'' finished in eighth with
a gate of $3.2 million, and ``Another 48 HRS.'' was ninth on $3
million. ``Jetsons: The Movie'' was 10th with collections of $2.9
million.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Sunday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Die Hard 2,'' 20th Century Fox, $14.5 million, 2,433
screens, $5,965 per screen, $60.7 million, two weeks.
   2. ``Ghost,'' Paramount, $12.2 million, 1,101 screens, $11,073

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rules Against Sharon's Emergency Housing Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's Supreme Court today overturned
emergency regulations by Housing Minister Ariel Sharon to speed the
construction of homes for thousands of Soviet immigrants.
   The three-judge panel ruled Sharon could have sought approval
for the programs from parliament instead of using the emergency
powers.
   It was the first time the court challenged the government's use
of such regulations, which date from Israel's 1948 independence war.
   Up to 150,000 Soviet immigrants are expected to arrive this
year. Tent cities are springing up across the country as part of
protests by Israelis who say subsidies for immigrants are driving
up rents and pricing others out of the housing market.
   Sharon, who also serves as Cabinet coordinator of immigration,
had asked to use emergency regulations to allow the purchase of
3,000 prefabricated homes, either locally or abroad. The Cabinet
approved it July 1.
   ``There is no doubt that this is a revolutionary decision,''
said Moshe Negbi, a legal expert for the Hebrew daily newspaper
Hadashot.
   He said the procedure for emergency powers was introduced during
war in 1948 when there was a fear the Knesset, or parliament, could
not always be convened because of the fighting.
   ``For the first time, the Supreme Court clearly says that the
government ... must not use these radical powers when there is no
problem in convening the parliament,'' Negbi said. ``It must not
get around the parliament and adopt its authority.''
   Under the emergency regulations, the Cabinet authorized the
prefabricated housing units to be set up near nine Israeli towns,
most in the Galilee in the north and in the southern Negev desert.
   Some politicians expressed fear that Sharon would try to take
undemocratic actions, assuming powers delegated to planning
councils and zoning boards. Sharon was accused as defense minister
in 1982 of concealing military plans from the government that led
to the army's invasion of Lebanon.
   The high court panel issued its ruling after a liberal
legislator, Abraham Poraz of the Shinui Party, appealed Sharon's
use of emergency regulations.
   In his appeal, Poraz argued Sharon used emergency regulations at
a time when the Knesset was debating the housing crisis. Last week,
the Knesset passed a law that shortened housing license procedures.
   ``Emergency regulations are an anti-democratic act ... that
should be used only in difficult, exceptional situations, when
there is no other choice,'' Poraz said on Israel army radio.
   The government argued in its court response that emergency
regulations were needed to ease the housing crisis created by the
mass influx of Soviet Jews.
   According to figures submitted by the government, Israel's
20,000 available rental apartments will be filled by the end of
September.

Advance</HEAD>

   Hezbollah fighters dislodged their Amal
militia rivals from a key hilltop village in southern Lebanon in
fierce fighting, leaving the village square ``littered with
bodies,'' police said today.
   Palestine Liberation Organization fighters moved in to block the
fundamentalist Hezbollah's push to expand its territory and later
came under mortar fire from Hezbollah, which overran the village of
Jarjou.
   At least eight people were killed and 27 wounded in fighting
during the night, police said. That raised the casualty toll since
fighting began early Monday to at least 20 killed and 77 wounded.
   The PLO said it intervened to block the apparent drive by
Hezbollah, or Party of God, to the Mediterranean coast.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group
while Amal is a Syrian-backed group comprised of more secular
Shiites. The rival militias have been fighting off and on for three
years for control of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's
largest sect.
   Police said Hezbollah fighters broke through Amal's defenses
around the village of Jajrou and were advancing toward Nabatiyeh,
the main town in the central sector of southern Lebanon.
   Jarjou is five miles north of Nabatiyeh, which has been
controlled by Amal since an offensive against Hezbollah two years
ago.
   ``It was close-quarter combat in Jarjou. The village square is
littered with bodies that couldn't be evacuated by the Red Cross
because of the savage fighting,'' a police spokesman said.
   Police said several hundred heavily armed guerrillas from Fatah,
Yasser Arafat's faction in the PLO, moved in to halt the
bloodletting this morning. It deployed along a two-mile front
between Amal and Hezbollah along the southwestern edge of the
disputed zone in the villages of Sarba and Houmine overlooking
Jarjou.
   Four hours later, Hezbollah fighters shelled the Palestinians in
Sarba with 82mm and 120mm mortars, police said.
   Lt. Col. Anwar Madi, commander of the PLO force in Sarba,
reported no casualties in the barrage.
   The police spokesman said Madi shouted at the Hezbollah fighters
through a bullhorn: ``Stop shooting or we'll respond.''
   The shelling ``sharply decreased about 15 minutes later,'' the
spokesman said.
   The PLO has about 5,000 fighters in the south based in refugee
camps around Sidon.
   Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps has an estimated 3,000
men deployed in the Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon. The guards
were moved there in 1982 during Israel's invasion of Lebanon.
   The PLO fears that Hezbollah's aim is to seize control of Sidon,
the southern provincial capital, to gain an outlet to the
Mediterranean, a move that would dramatically alter the strategic
balance in the region north of Israel.
   Hezbollah badly needs a coastal outlet because its supply lines
from the Bekaa Valley northeast of the battle zone are vulnerable
to interdiction by Syria and its Lebanese allies.
   A PLO source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said if
Hezbollah was allowed to control ``any part of the coast, they'll
have a port to ship in weapons, ammunition and fighters and
establish their own Islamic republic modeled on Iran.''
   The PLO also is determined to prevent Iran from establishing
control, through Hezbollah, of strategic terrain east of the
Palestinian camps in Sidon.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Palestinian deployment today was ``personally ordered by Arafat in
a message received overnight.''
   Shortly after the PLO force was deployed, Israeli warplanes made
several low-level passes over the battle zone.
   ``They're apparently monitoring the Palestinian deployment,''
the police spokesman said.
   In January, a battalion-size PLO force intervened to separate
Amal and Hezbollah units in the region. That halted a Hezbollah
advance, saved Amal from a decisive defeat and at the same time
enlarged the PLO's area of control.
   By police count, 1,069 people have been killed and 3,228 wounded
in Amal-Hezbollah fighting since late 1986.

<HEAD>12 Cuban Asylum-Seekers Leave Czechoslovak Embassy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with details, Cuban agency not
mentioning a promise to the asylum-seekers. Pick up 8th pvs, `Five

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twelve Cuban asylum-seekers have
left the Czechoslovak Embassy in Havana, and one report said the
Cuban government promised to help them leave the country.
   However, Cuba's official news agency reported the release
without any mention of a promise to help the Cubans leave.
   At least eight other would-be emigrants were reported still
holed up in diplomatic compounds.
   The East German news agency ADN, in a dispatch from Havana
today, quoted the Cuban Foreign Ministry as saying the
asylum-seekers left Monday night after the country's Communist
government promised to help them find asylum abroad. Czechoslovak
radio also reported the release.
   A Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry official, Jindrich Opava, said
by telephone that he had no details on the circumstances of the
asylum-seekers' leaving.
   The Cuban agency Prensa Latina, also quoting an official
statement, said the asylum-seekers would be returned to their homes
upon completion of an investigation of the incident.
   It made no mention of any Cuban promise to the asylum seekers.
The Spanish news agency EFE also quoted the Cuban statement as
saying 11 of the Cubans ``left the embassy voluntarily (and)
unconditionally'' Monday night. The twelfth, according to
Czechoslovak sources, was evacuated earlier Monday in an ambulance
after his blood pressure went up, EFE said.
   On Monday evening, the Mexican news agency Notimex quoted the
Cuban Foreign Ministry as saying it would not give in to the
refugees' demands for safe conduct out of the country.
   Five of the 12 had arrived on July 9 and apparently remained
peaceful. But the other seven, who arrived on Wednesday, took
several diplomats hostage on Monday, Notimex reported from Havana.
   The agency said they threatened to blow up an embassy building
unless they were allowed to go to the United States. They were
believed to be unarmed.
   Czechoslovak television reported later that the diplomats had
been released.
   Five refugees remained at the residence of Czechoslovak charge
d'affaires Jan Doemoek, ADN said. It said the diplomat has asked
Cuban authorities to eject the five from his home, but the Cubans
have so far refused.
   It said Czechoslovakia was refusing to grant asylum to the five
because they used violence to break into the diplomat's home.
   In addition, three would-be emigrants took refuge in the Spanish
embassy last week. Madrid lodged a protest after Cuban authorities
chased a fourth onto the grounds of the Spanish Embassy and hauled
him away Sunday.
   ADN said ``tumultuous scenes'' occurred at the Czechoslovak
Embassy compound Monday, with furniture and other objects being
thrown from the windows.
   The affair has soured Cuba's relations with Czechoslovakia. The
countries had been close allies before last fall's ``velvet
revolution'' toppled Prague's hard-line Communist leaders.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro has defied the reformist trend
sweeping Eastern Europe, refusing to abandon socialism.
   Castro, in his first official statement on the affair, called
the asylum-seekers ``antisocial elements encouraged by Czechoslovak
diplomats,'' the Czechoslovak newspaper Lidova Demokracie said
Monday.
   The newspaper also quoted him as saying that Cuba has no
agreement on diplomatic asylum with European countries, and the
embassies of these countries have no right to grant asylum.
   Czechoslovak television quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Lubos
Dobrovsky on Monday as saying a deputy foreign minister would leave
for Havana immediately because ``it is necessary to protect the
safety of Czechoslovak citizens.''
   As the tension over the refugees increased, about 30
Czechoslovaks left Cuba on Sunday on a regular flight, Lidova
Demokracie reported Monday. Opava said they included some families
of diplomats.

<TEXT>
   An obsessed fan of ``Cagney and
Lacey'' star Sharon Gless apologized during her sentencing to six
years in prison for a break-in at the performer's home.
   Joni Leigh Penn, 30, of Garden Grove pleaded no contest to two
felony burglary charges Monday in San Fernando Superior Court.
   ``I just want to apologize to Sharon Gless and her family and
any of her friends for all the stress and trouble I've caused,''
said Ms. Penn.
   ``I want her to feel safe, because she is from me, and I'm
really sorry for what I did,'' she said.
   Gless' brother and attorney, Michael Gless, said that he was
glad Ms. Penn would be locked up for a while.
   ``That might be enough for her to get the help she needs so this
won't be a problem any more,'' he said.
   Police said Penn was carrying an assault rifle when she
barricaded herself in Gless' home. Gless, who played a tough police
detective on the old ``Cagney and Lacey'' television series, was
not at her Studio City home.
   Police said Ms. Penn told them she was in love with Gless and
planned to sexually assault her, then kill herself. At the time,
she was under a restraining order instructing her to stay away from
the actress.

   Writer Susan Sontag may cut back on lecturing.
Population studies expert Paul Ehrlich says he will buy part of a
rain forest. And public health activist Sidney M. Wolfe plans to
continue battling for consumers.
   All three were contemplating how to deal with sudden wealth as
recipients of this year's MacArthur fellowships, grants of up to
$375,000 that the 36 winners may spend as they choose.
   A juggler, a free-lance wildlife illustrator and numerous poets
and academicians also received the prestigious grants announced
Monday by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.
   The grants range from $150,000 to $375,000 over five years, with
the largest amounts going to the oldest recipients.
   ``It's very liberating, and it's also a great honor,'' Sontag of
her $340,000 grant. ``It's an incredible relief. It means a lot for
my work.''
   The 57-year-old essayist and critic, whose works include ``On
Photography'' and ``AIDS and its Metaphors,'' said she can now
concentrate on writing and cut back on lecturing that was needed
``to help pay the rent.''
   Individuals cannot apply for the grants, which must be proposed
to the foundation by a group of more than 100 designated nominators
nationwide. Nominations are reviewed by a selection committee, and
final approval for the fellowships comes from the foundation's
board of directors.
   A total of 319 fellows have been named since the program began
in 1981. They have ranged in age from 18 to 82, representing fields
including the arts, human rights, mathematics and medicine.
   Ehrlich, a Stanford University professor whose work also
includes environmental preservation, said he will use his $345,000
grant to buy part of an Argentinian rain forest that is rich in
bioligical specimens.
   ``For somebody in my position, (the grant) is the best of all
possible worlds,'' Ehrlich said.
   ``It's just delightful to get recognized by this organization,''
said Wolfe, a 53-year-old physician and director of the Public
Citizen Health Research Group, a Washington-based public-interest
group whose work has led to government bans or limitation on
certain drugs and medical devices.
   Wolfe received a $320,000 grant, but said, ``The thing that
means the most is really recognizing that our way of researching
health issues and trying to improve people's health is important.''
   Also among this year's recipients are Jacques D'Amboise, founder
of the National Dance Institute; Michael Moschen, a juggler who has
appeared in several films and on television's ``Sesame Street;''
and Kent Whealy, co-director of the Seed Savers Exchange, a
Decorah, Iowa, group that preserves heirloom varieties of crop
plants.
   The MacArthur Foundation is the legacy of John D. MacArthur,
founder of Bankers Life and Casualty Co. and a Chicago
philanthropist who died in 1978; and his wife, Catherine, who died
in 1981.
   The bulk of the couple's fortune went to the foundation they
created, which has awarded more than $800 million in grants since
1978.

<HEAD>Jubilant Kohl Says Pan-German Elections Expected in December</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A jubilant Chancellor Helmut Kohl said
today that he and Mikhail S. Gorbachev have solved all practical
problems in the way of German unification and that elections for an
all-German parliament are expected on Dec. 2.
   Kohl met with reporters a day after returning from a two-day
trip to the Soviet Union, where he and the Soviet president
announced Gorbachev had dropped his objections to NATO membership
for a united Germany.
   The Soviet objections had been the most significant obstacle to
unification.
   ``The practical problems, which lay before us on the way to
German unity, have been solved,'' Kohl said.
   He said joint German elections were expected Dec. 2, but whether
East Germany merges with the West before or after elections had to
be decided by East Berlin.
   He also reiterated his position that the capital of a united
Germany must be decided by the new Parliament.
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, who is pushing
for Berlin over Bonn as united Germany's capital, has said the
capital must be stipulated in a unification treaty now in
preparation.
   Kohl said that during his visit he had offered no specific
economic aid to the Soviets, but he emphasized that Gorbachev needs
financial help if his program of economic restructuring is to
succeed.
   He said he could envision the West Germans helping the Soviets
retrain the thousands of soldiers who would return from East
Germany and possibly face unemployment, as well as help in
supplying housing but ``not for a certain category of Soviet
residents.''
   West German officials worry about the political fallout at home
of building housing specifically for returning Soviet troops.
   Kohl ruled out the possibility that West Germany would be the
sole source of financial aid to the Soviets, saying the burden
would be too great.
   At the Houston summit of the world's industrial leaders last
week, Kohl had pushed for a $15 billion international aid package
for the Soviet Union. Instead, the leaders asked the International
Monetary Fund to study exactly what kind of aid would be most
beneficial.
   West Germany has already backed a $3 billion bank credit to help
the Soviet Union shift its economy to a free market and has agreed
to pay $780 million toward the upkeep of Soviet soldiers stationed
in East Germany in the second half of this year.
   Kohl said he hoped a bilateral treaty with the Soviet Union that
covered all areas and provided for regular meetings could be ready
by next summer. He set the same time frame for a treaty with
Poland, and said he wanted it to be wide-ranging, not just focusing
on the border question.
   Poland has been pushing for a formal, written guarantee that
Germany will never try to reclaim territory it lost after World War
II. One-third of modern day Poland was once German land.
   Among the Kohl and Gorbachev agreements announced Monday were
plans to reduce the size of a united German army to 370,000
soldiers within three to four years after unification. Currently,
the two Germanys have about 600,000 soldiers under arms.
   East German Foreign Minister Markus Meckel today rejected the
idea of one German army. He said East Germany should retain its
army and its own command structure and called for even deeper cuts
in the combined armed forces.

   Western countries are praising Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's decision to allow a united Germany the
freedom to join NATO, calling it a turning point in European
history.
   The decision, announced Monday by Gorbachev and West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, was ``an extremely positive development in
Soviet thinking,'' Britain's Foreign Office said.
   ``We have throughout argued that a united Germany in NATO would
be in the best interests of all those concerned,'' it said in a
statement.
   In Washington, President Bush said Gorbachev's action
``strengthens efforts to build enduring relationships based on
cooperation.''
   By dropping its objection to NATO membership for a united
Germany, the Soviet Union removed the last big obstacle to German
unification.
   A beaming Kohl said today in Bonn that he and Gorbachev have
solved all practical problems in the way of unification and that
elections for an all-German parliament are expected on Dec. 2.
   Gorbachev and Kohl announced the agreement in a televised news
conference in Gorbachev's home region, Stavropol in the Soviet
republic of Russia. The area was one of the deepest points of
German penetration during World War II.
   The announcement capped several months of intense diplomatic
maneuvering, during which Germany backed a $3 billion bank loan to
Moscow and pushed its allies for a comprehensive plan to bail out
the crumbling Soviet economy.
   The Foreign Office said Gorbachev was evidently swayed by the
July 5-6 NATO summit in London at which the 16 leaders of the
Western alliance committed themselves to limiting the size of the
German army _ a prime Soviet concern.
   Leaders of North Atlantic Treaty Organization also offered a
non-aggression pact to the Soviet Union and other Eastern European
countries, and said nuclear arms would only be weapons of ``last
resort.''
   France, a major West European power that belongs to NATO but
keeps its military forces outside the alliance's command, had no
immediate comment. Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said he was
waiting to hear the news personally from West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   In Rome, an Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman praised
Gorbachev's position. ``At first glance we look on it with extreme
favor,'' said the spokesman, who declined to be identified.
   Austria, which is not a member of NATO, said the agreement was
``a historic hour for Europe and for the world.''
   ``The long journey of European history in this century has
reached a very positive station,'' said Austrian Chancellor Franz
Vranitzky. It is ``the foundation for building a peaceful Europe.''
   The Soviet Union took the heaviest casualties of any nation in
World War II, with some 20 million people killed.
   In Tokyo, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu today hailed the
development as ``big progress.'' Japan is not a NATO member by has
expressed its intention to send officials as observers to meetings
of both NATO and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
   NATO, in a statement from its Brussels headquarters, said
Gorbachev's acceptance of a unified Germany in the Western alliance
``will increase stability for all ... including the Soviet Union.''
   In Bonn, the leader of Kohl's governing party said the decision
marked a ``new high point'' in German-Soviet relations.
   ``There is nothing more standing in the way of the reunification
of Germany in full sovereignty by the end of the year. The new
Europe has taken on a concrete form,'' said Volker Ruehe,
general-secretary of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere told West German
television ``the question ... of full sovereignty for a united
Germany has been secured.''
   In the German view, this includes an end to all remaining rights
over the divided nation by the four World War II victors _ the
Soviet Union, the United States, France and Britain.
   The four allies were meeting in Paris today for another round of
talks on the international implications of German unity.

   Rescuers perched in dinghies
worked for three hours to untangle a whale from a fishing net, then
whooped and cheered as the humpback swam free.
   The rescuers were nearly capsized Monday when they came within
inches of the 38-foot whale's breathing hole. The whale named
Mallard was discovered earlier in the day thrashing in the Atlantic
Ocean, 30 miles from Boston.
   ``Boy, did these guys have guts,'' said Captain Tom Hill of the
Yankee Captains, one of the vessels dispatched to try to save the
5-year-old whale. ``All it would take is one good swipe with a
flipper to kill them.''
   But with patience and daring, the rescuers untangled the net
from Mallard's flippers, mouth and tail. The 25-ton humpback,
spouting and breaching, joined a throng of whales that had remained
nearby.
   Once the sight of a helpless whale would have been considered a
bounty for sailors who plied the Atlantic in search of whales.
Today, the ships that roam this area are filled with people longing
for a glimpse of the creatures.
   Rescue workers attached buoys to the trailing ends of the net
wrapped around Mallard and waited for the humpback to tire and rest
on the surface. The other whales kept a safe distance, expect for
one that came up alongside the entangled mammal and rubbed its head.
   Leading a crew of four rescuers, Charles ``Stormy'' Mayo, head
of the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Mass., launched
two inflatable and motorized dinghies and floated on top of the two
whales.
   When Mallard suddenly reared its head, Mayo's boat nearly
overturned.
   ``Finally, we were able to cut the lines with some of our
specialized equipment. Rough weather made this rescue quite
difficult,'' Mayo said later.
   ``The whale seemed to work in harmony with our efforts to free
it.''
   The rescue mission began after a fisherman radioed that he was
awakened in the morning by a whale thrashing next to his boat.
   The whale, named by whale watchers when it was first recorded in
1986, was identified by scars and coloring on its tail and flukes.
   Mallard _ sex unknown _ was tangled in one of the
quarter-mile-long gill nets set on the lucrative Stellwagen Bank
fishing grounds about 17 miles off Gloucester and 25 miles from
Provincetown. Whales come to the area to feed on cod, haddock and
other fish plentiful this time of year.

<HEAD>Energy Department Releasing Records of Nuclear-Weapons Workers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Records detailing radiation exposure of
50,000 nuclear weapons workers are being sent to researchers who
were denied access to the information in the late 1970s after they
detected high cancer rates.
   The federal Energy Department said Monday that the computer
tapes containing data on the workers at the Hanford, Wash., nuclear
reservation would be in the mail today at the latest. They would
have been mailed Monday but for a minor glitch in preparing the
tapes, department spokesman Robert Griffin said today.
   ``It won't be very dramatic, but it's a great moment in history
of this research,'' said Alice Stewart, one of three radiation
scientists awaiting the records.
   Last month, after resisting for years, the Energy Department
agreed to release the data, in a settlement with a
Philadelphia-based group that monitors plant safety, the Three Mile
Island Public Health Fund.
   ``It's been a long struggle and I'm very gratified that we've
been successful,'' said Daniel Berger, a lawyer for the group.
   Researchers Thomas Mancuso of the University of Pittsburgh and
Stewart and George Kneale of Birmingham University in England
studied Hanford records in the late 1970s for the Energy Department
but were discharged after publishing preliminary findings showing
high cancer rates.
   ``We left the story rather abruptly because we produced a risk
estimate that was considered impossibly high,'' Stewart recalled.
   The release is important, she said, because it shows that
``whoever owns the industry must never be totally in charge of
health records.''
   In Washington, Energy Department spokesman Bob Griffin said
officials in Hanford were ``making last-minute adjustments, working
feverishly'' to prepare the tapes for delivery.
   The department agreed to release records of workers at 10
weapons plants in four batches over the next 10 months. All told,
the information will cover 200,000 of the 300,000 current and
former workers at the plants since World War II.
   The Energy Department stopped financing the research and denied
access to the records, citing patient confidentiality. The Three
Mile Island Public Health Fund sued for access and the department
agreed to reopen the files.
   It enabled the resumption of research done more than 10 years
ago, Stewart said.
   ``We're hoping that, say by the end of year, we'll establish
some very firm points,'' she said.
   Stewart estimated cancer rates may be shown to be three to five
times higher than most experts previously thought, in line with the
preliminary findings of 13 years ago.
   The next batch of records to be released will over workers from
these plants: Rocky Flats, Colo.; Los Alamos National Laboratory,
N.M.; Mound Laboratory, Miamisburg, Ohio; and the Pantex facility
in Amarillo, Texas.
   After that, records will be released from plants at Oak Ridge,
Tenn. and Savannah River, S.C.; followed by records from the
Fernald Feed Plant, Fernald, Ohio; the Mallinckrodt Chemical Works
in St. Louis and the K-25 Plant in Oak Ridge.

   Andrew Young put his bid to become Georgia's
first black governor before the voters today, and a federal judge
refused to throw out Georgia's runoff election system.
   Late polls showed Young running slightly behind Lt. Gov. Zell
Miller in the five-way Democratic primary with neither of them
likely to gain the majority vote required to avoid an Aug. 7 runoff.
   Black leaders acting without Young's support had filed a lawsuit
arguing the runoff system is unfair to blacks, who make up about 22
percent of Georgia's registered voters.
   They asked U.S. District Judge Richard Freeman to declare
today's top finisher the Democratic nominee even if he did not have
a majority.
   But the judge, who held a five-day hearing on the request last
week, today refused to interfere, saying he would not issue a
temporary restraining order that would have immediately blocked the
runoff. He did not set a trial date to consider the issue further.
   It was cloudy in Atlanta and elsewhere, but there was no rain to
discourage voters early today. Election officials predicted that 33
percent of registered voters would cast ballots.
   Young, the former Atlanta mayor, U.N. ambassador and
congressman, predicted Monday he would run more strongly in
predominantly white areas today than pollsters and other observers
expect.
   ``A lot of people who say I couldn't get votes in south Georgia
have implied there's something backward about south Georgia, and I
think they've underestimated south Georgia again,'' he said in
Columbus. ``We're going to surprise people in where we get votes.''
   Miller and state Sen. Roy Barnes, also expressed optimism as
they crisscrossed the state Monday. Both are white.
   ``I feel better about this campaign and this race than any of
the others,'' Miller said at a rally in suburban Atlanta.
   Barnes refused to concede defeat despite Young's prediction
earlier Monday that the state senator would support him in a runoff
against Miller.
   ``Andy and I have deep philosophical differences,'' said Barnes,
who portrayed himself as the conservative alternative to
``tax-and-spend liberals.''
   Polls have shown state Rep. Johnny Isakson with a strong lead in
the four-man Republican gubernatorial race.
   Gov. Joe Frank Harris, a Democrat, is completing his second term
and cannot seek re-election.
   Despite the closeness of the race, the Democratic campaign has
been a gentlemanly affair, free of negative advertising and racial
appeals. Even former Gov. Lester Maddox, a longtime segregationist
running a longshot campaign, de-emphasized race as an issue.
   Young said he didn't attribute the positive nature of the
campaign to any altruism on the candidates' part. Rather, he said,
negative campaigns don't seem to work these days.
   ``I think they would fire away if they thought it would work,''
he said.
   Miller, who has made a lottery to raise money for schools his
signature issue, attributed the positive atmosphere to ``the
character of the candidates.''
   ``And I think it has been good for the state of Georgia,
racially,'' Miller said. ``You can't get elected in Georgia without
a strong coalition of urban and rural and black and white.''
   In event of a runoff, Young will be battling for white support.
A recent poll by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution showed 36 percent
of likely Democratic voters favored Miller, 30 percent Young and 16
percent Barnes. The poll had a margin of error of 3 points.
   But the poll found that only 14 percent of white voters
supported Young, while 45 percent supported Miller.
   Three seats in the U.S. House also are being contested today,
but only one incumbent, Rep. Doug Barnard, has opposition. Barnard,
a Democrat from Augusta, is a member of the House Banking Committee
and has been accused of being too cozy with savings and loan
officials. He faces journalism student Scott A. Starling.
   J.B. Stoner, a white supremacist who served time for the bombing
of a black church in Alabama, is running for lieutenant governor
but is considered the longest shot of nine candidates in the
Democratic primary.

   Authorities said today that more than
230 people were killed in a major earthquake, and television
reports said the worst affected areas were woefully short of blood,
medicine and rescue equipment.
   U.S. military units rushed to two of the worst affected areas
with medical supplies and engineering equipment to help clear
rubble. Japan and other countries also provided help.
   President Corazon Aquino today visited the quake-stricken city
of Cabanatuan and declaed a state of emergency in the affected
areas.
   Scores of buildings were destroyed by Monday's temblor and the
death toll was expected to rise as rescuers pulled more bodies from
the rubble.
   Figures compiled by the Office of Civil Defense and the
Philippine Red Cross showed 234 people were killed and more than
600 injured in the quake, which measured 7.7 on the Richter scale
and struck the country's main island of Luzon, including Manila.
Its epicenter was 60 miles north of the capital.
   Officials complained that rescue efforts were hampered by a lack
of heavy equipment to remove rubble. Reporters said some efforts
appeared disorganized with little evidence of government
supervision.
   In Geneva, the International Red Cross today appealed for
$357,000 to provide aid _ mostly food and medicines _ to earthquake
victims.
   The hardest-hit area was the mountain resort of Baguio, 110
miles north of Manila, where 22 buildings, including four hotels,
were heavily damaged.
   Officials said as many as 1,000 people were trapped in damaged
buildings in Baguio, with the Hyatt Hotel sustaining the worst
damage. Officials estimated about 50 people died.
   The earthquake caused the catwalks that surrounded a five-story
indoor atrium to collapse, and parts of adjacent guest rooms fell
into the lobby.
   The quake ripped the city's luxury Nevada Hotel in half, leaving
a huge gash in the middle of the structure. Baguio radio station
DZWT said 23 people were killed when the commerce building at the
University of Baguio collapsed.
   U.S. officials said four members of the U.S. Agency for
International Development were staying at the Nevada and one was
missing.
   A Filipino television reporter who visited Baguio by helicopter
described the city as a virtual ``war zone,'' running low on food,
water and fuel.
   An American medical unit from the Subic Bay naval base was flown
by helicopter to Baguio, a fashionable summer retreat, today to
help in rescue efforts and establish a field hospital.
   Thirteen aftershocks rumbled across Luzon after the quake and
many of Baguio's 119,000 people slept outdoors Monday night. Manila
television stations showed clusters of the homeless camped out in a
city park.
   Numerous bridges in central Luzon were heavily damaged and
hundreds of motorists were stuck along highways. Roads to Baguio
were blocked by landslides, officials said.
   Officials said the other worst affected areas were Dagupan, 100
miles north of Manila, and Nueva Ecija province, which includes the
80,000-resident city of Cabanatuan, where a six-story school
collapsed.
   Schools were ordered closed indefinitely in Manila and other
affected areas as officials inspected classroom buildings for
damage.
   In Cabanatuan, 60 miles north of Manila, hospitals were so
jammed with injured that many patients spent Monday night on cots
in the hospital's yards. Hospitals said 35 people were killed in
the area and 154 injured.
   Mayor Honorato Perez said up to 30 people were believed still
trapped beneath the rubble of the school. U.S. military engineers
from Clark Air Base brought in heavy equipment to clear the rubble.
   Volunteers had been trying to dig through the rubble, sometimes
with bare hands. They appeared to be acting with little supervision
by local authorities.
   In Cabanatuan, friends and relatives of the students kept vigil
at the ruined school. Each time a survivor was brought out, the
crowd rushed forward asking for word of their loved ones.
   In Dagupan, the civil defense office reported 20 deaths.
   U.S. officials said some of the Baguio injured were being
transported to American military hospitals at nearby Camp John Hay
and Clark Air Base.
   The Pentagon said it provided an Air Force C-141 transport plane
to carry 16 civilian search and rescue personnel, four dogs and
support equipment to assist in the hunt for survivors.
   Canada, Thailand, Switzerland and South Korea also offered
assistance.
   Officials said 10 people were killed in the metropolitan Manila.
   The Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology recorded
more than 70 aftershocks.
   Monday's quake was the worst to strike the Philippines since
1976, when a 7.8-magnitude quake killed 8,000 people. Most died in
a tidal wave that struck Mindanao.
   The June 21 earthquake in Iran registered 7.3 to 7.7 on the
Richter scale and killed at least 40,000 people.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means the ground motion
is 10 times greater.

   At least 40 mountain climbers, including 13
foreigners, have died in an avalanche set off by an earthquake in
the Pamir mountains in Soviet Central Asia, the Tass news agency
and climbing officials said today.
   Three climbers in the group survived when the avalanche Friday
engulfed a base camp on Lenin Peak, a climbing coach said.
   According to Vladimir Shatayev, a coach with the Soviet mountain
climbing committee, Alexei Koren of Leningrad suffered a broken arm
and an unidentified Czechovakian member of the group broke a leg. A
third climber escaped unhurt, he said.
   The two injured climbers were taken to a hospital in Osh, in the
Republic of Kirghizia, he said.
   Tass said the avalanche struck the base camp, known as ``Frying
Pan,'' situated at the 15,900-feet level of Lenin Peak in the
Central Asian mountain range 1,800 miles southeast of Moscow.
   ``There has never been such a tragedy in the history of Soviet
mountain climbing,'' Shatayev said in a telephone interview. ``I
don't think there has ever been such an accident in the world.''
   He said the base camp has been in use since the 1930s. Since
1974, he said, the base camp has been almost permanently occupied
by groups of 100 or more mountain climbers.
   Shatayev said 23 of the victims belonged to the Leningrad
mountain climbing team, four came from Israel, six from
Czechoslovakia, two from Switzerland and one from Spain. The
remainder were from other Soviet clubs.
   He said none of the bodies have been recovered, but that a team
of 100 rescue workers was searching for the remains of the victims.
``Everything is complicated by heavy snow,'' he said.
   Interfax, the information service of Moscow Radio, said the
climbers were preparing to climb to the top of Lenin Peak when the
avalanche struck.

   An animal rights activist who pleaded no
contest to trying to bomb the head of a company that uses dogs in
medical demonstrations has been sentenced to 32 months in prison.
   Fran Trutt was accused of planting a pipe bomb near the parking
space of Leon C. Hirsch, chairman and chief executive of
Norwalk-based U.S. Surgical Corp., in November 1988. The company
uses anesthetized live dogs to show surgeons how to use its
surgical staplers, used in some cases in places of sutures.
   Trutt, 35, of New York, pleaded no contest April 16 to charges
of attempted murder, possession of explosives and bomb
manufacturing in the incident.
   Stamford Superior Court Judge Joette Katz imposed a sentence of
10 years for each charge, to run concurrently and suspended after
32 months. With credit for time already served, Trutt will be
released from prison next March 31.
   Trutt told Katz that she feels she is a scapegoat. ``Here I am
taking the brunt for it. This is unbelievable,'' she said. She had
said in interviews that she wanted to scare Hirsch, not kill him.
   Animal protection groups, citing an abhorrence of violence, did
not rally behind Trutt until her attorney, John R. Williams,
alleged the company had set her up.
   According to Williams, Mary Lou Sapone was cent Chevron stake to slightly
less than
10 percent.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .21 to 201.34. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index fell 1.10 to 364.48.

   A federal judge today refused to halt Georgia's
Aug. 7 primary runoff despite a challenge by blacks to the state's
majority vote rule, saying the opponents had filed too late to
disrupt this year's elections.
   The 16-page ruling, which came as voters were going to the polls
to choose Democratic and Republican nominees for governor, allows
the state to hold runoffs, if they are needed after today's vote.
   An attorney for the black plaintiffs said he could not rule out
a future court challenge to the outcome of the runoff.
   Granting an injunction to halt the runoff at this late date
would ``significantly disrupt elections at all levels in Georgia,''
U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman said in his order.
   Candidates who signed up for today's primary ``reasonably
believed that the majority vote requirement would govern the 1990
elections,'' Freeman said.
   But he also said the plaintiffs had raised a legitimate point
that would have to be decided later.
   A coalition of black political and community leaders filed a
lawsuit in May, seeking to abolish Georgia's majority vote
requirement on grounds that it discriminates against black voters.
   They asked Freeman for a preliminary injunction that would have
halted the Aug. 7 runoff. Such a runoff is expected in the
Democratic gubernatorial primary, where pre-election polls indicate
no one is likely to get an absolute majority. A runoff is
considered less likely in the Republican primary.
   Among the five Democrats in today's governor's race was Andrew
Young, the former Atlanta mayor seeking to become Georgia's first
black governor. A ruling halting the runoff could have favored
Young, most observers believe, although Young did not support the
lawsuit.
   The judge, who held a five-day hearing on the request last week,
did not address the merits of the lawsuit itself in his ruling
today. But he wrote, ``Given the evidence presently before the
court, it appears to be a close question as to whether plaintiffs
will ultimately prevail on the merits of their claims.''
   Laughlin McDonald, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney
who helped file the suit for the black plaintiffs, said the group
was not likely to appeal Freeman's decision. But he did not rule
out the possibility of a challenge to the results of the runoff
when attorneys argue the merits of the case before the judge.
   Freeman has not set a trial date for the lawsuit.
   In his ruling, Freeman noted that the group filed the lawsuit
only three months before the Aug. 7 runoff and at least five years
after state Rep. Tyrone Brooks, the lead plaintiff, said he had
viewed the majority vote requirement as racially discriminatory.
   Brooks testified during the hearing that he had considered the
requirement discriminatory since 1984.
   Freeman said he was sympathetic to testimony that the group was
unable to obtain representation earlier, but added, ``The court
cannot ignore the timing of the filing of plaintiff's suit in
assessing the equities of this case.''
   He also said the group had failed to support its contention that
the court would have to call a special election and unseat
incumbents who were not plurality winners if it later found that
the majority vote requirement caused irreparable injury to the
plaintiffs.
   McDonald said he was not disappointed with today's ruling.
   ``We had two purposes,'' he said. ``One was to try to get an
injunction to stop the runoff. The second was to make certain we
raised a legally valid objection to the use of the runoff. We
accomplished half of that.''

   The declaration of a tie in the Republican
primary for in a suburban legislative district has forced a lottery
to determine the winner _ and ensured an appeal from the loser.
   Cook County Circuit Judge Francis Barth declared the March 20
primary race, which pitted a strongly anti-abortion incumbent
against a pro-choice challenger, a tie Monday after reviewing a
recount.
   The original primary results showed Mary Mulligan, a paralegal
from Des Plaines, had defeated incumbent Rep. Penny Pullen by 31
votes in the 55th District race.
   Pullen sued for a recount, which Barth ordered July 3. The
recount was conducted last week.
   At Monday's hearing, Barth threw out 39 ballots that had not
registered on the electronic computer system used in punch-card
voting. Mat Delort, an attorney for Mulligan, said today that with
the 39 ballots, Pullen probably would have been ahead.
   Under Illinois law, the State Board of Elections must hold a
lottery to determine the winner of a tied election. The race could
be decided by the flip of a coin or by pulling a name from a hat.
   The Board of Elections was expected to conduct the lottery this
week.
   But the lottery is not likely to be the final step.
   ``Both sides agree there definitely will be an appeal,'' said
Pullen's lawyer, Michael Lavelle.
   Mulligan's attorney said each candidate is proceeding with
campaign plans on the assumption that she will be declared the
winner.
   ``I'm very pleased,'' said Pullen, a seven-term representative.
``We live to fight another day.''
   ``I think we have a lot of issues that are appealable in our
favor if it (the lottery) shouldn't go the right way,'' Mulligan
said in a telephone interview.
   Lavelle, former chairman of the Chicago Board of Election
Commissioners, argued Monday that the three-day recount completed
Wednesday at the Cook County warehouse showed Pullen winning by 17
votes. But lawyers for Mulligan contended the recount showed a tie.
   The victor in the heavily Republican district in Chicago's north
suburbs will face Democrat Robert Mucci in the November election.

   The government today lifted a ban on
opposition campaigning for a national referendum on one-party rule.
   Judge Matthew Ngulube, head of the government-appointed
referendum commission, said campaigning will be allowed beginning
Monday as long as the language used is ``sober and temperate'' and
does not defame individuals.
   Pro-democracy activists have so far been denied access to the
media but Ngulube said today opposition groups would be allowed to
buy campaign advertisements.
   The secret ballot scheduled Oct. 17 will ask voters ``if they
support the reintroduction of a multiparty system,'' he said.
   Voters will use one of two symbols to cast their vote.
   The symbol for a ``yes'' vote will be a hand; the symbol for a
``no'' vote will be a foot.
   In April, the government announced plans for a referendum on
one-party rule and immediately banned public debate on the issue.
   Opposition activists said, however, the state-controlled media
continued to air arguments siding with President Kenneth Kaunda's
ruling United National Independence Party, the only legal political
organization in this southern African nation of 7.5 million people.
   Ngulube told Zambians their vote in the referendum will
determine the nation's future.
   ``This is a critical moment in our history...the future of our
country is in your hands,'' he said.
   Kaunda's party has held power unchallenged since 1973.
   In each district, referendum commission officers will monitor
public meetings to ensure both sides of the issue are equally
discussed, Ngulube said.
   He said police will attend meetings to maintain law and order.
   Last month, student-led protests against food price increases
and one-party rule left at least 26 people dead.
   Voicing widespread political discontent, labor leaders,
students, private businesses and churches have said they want to
form a broad-based opposition group.
   Zambia, one of Africa's poorest and most indebted nations, last
held a referendum in 1969 and that vote endorsed measures by Kaunda
to establish a one-party system.
   Kaunda has said he will abide by the outcome of the referendum
and is confident his party will retain its monopoly on power.

   President Kenneth Kaunda today turned over
to British officials a British nurse freed at his request from an
Iraqi prison where she was jailed for helping a journalist who was
hanged as a spy.
   Daphne Parish, 53, was driven to the home of British High
Commissioner Peter Henchliffe after spending the night at State
House, Kaunda's official residence in the capital, Lusaka.
   She was freed Monday after pleas from Kaunda.
   At a brief ceremony, Kaunda prevented Mrs. Parish from answering
reporters' questions.
   But, looking tired and drawn, the soft-spoken nurse thanked
Kaunda for his role in her release from Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.
   The British nurse was sentenced to 15 years in prison as an
accomplice to Farzad Bazoft, an Iranian-born British journalist who
worked for The Observer newspaper.
   Mrs. Parish was arrested in September after driving Bazoft to
the Al-Iskandaria military installation outside Baghdad.
   The Observer said Bazoft, who lived in Britain and traveled on
British documents, was trying to check out reports of an explosion.
But Iraq said he was a spy and hanged him on March 15.
   Iraq later confirmed 19 people died in an explosion at a
military installation.
   When asked by reporters about her visit to the military
installation with Bazoft, Mrs. Parish said: ``It didn't appear
improper at the time. We didn't do anything I considered illegal.''
   She said other British journalists had already visited the scene
and had climbed over a perimeter fence.
   ``We didn't climb over any fences,'' she said. ``As we were
driving around, we saw what appeared like coal dust on the side of
the road.''
   Bazoft wanted to collect some of the dust and she gave him a
bottle to put it in.
   ``We did this in full view of cars going up and down. We did
nothing secretly,'' she said.
   Iraq accused Bazoft of collecting soil samples to establish the
nature of weapons used at the military installation.
   Parish said she was told by prison guards of her release
midmorning Monday.
   ``I just laughed,'' she said.
   She said in the prison, where she shared a cell with four other
inmates, prisoners played fortune-telling games by reading tea
leaves in each others' cups.
   ``We said: Oh yes, you'll be released ... this afternoon. It was
a joke so I thought this was just another joke.''
   Kaunda said he sought Mrs. Parish's release on humanitarian
grounds. He did not question the validity of the sentence passed by
the Iraqi court.
   Kaunda said in a letter to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein dated
March 11 he also asked for the death sentence passed on Bazoft to
be commuted.
   In his letter, Kaunda said, he referred to `` the deep feelings
of love and confidence'' he shared with Hussein and asked for the
release of both Mrs. Parish and Bazoft.
   At his news conference Kaunda also lashed out at the British
press for what he termed its ``outrageous coverage'' of Mrs.
Parish's release.
   He claimed the British press reported that Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein ``and myself are using Daphne Parish to cleanse
ourselves. Zambia was never dirty. This was a genuine humanitarian
appeal.''
   Last month, the worst civil unrest since Zambia's independence
in 1964 erupted over food prices and calls for a Western-style
multiparty democracy.
   Rioting and a bungled coup attempt by mutinous soldiers June 30
left at least 26 people dead.

<TEXT>
   News that the White House boosted its projection
of next year's budget deficit caused barely a blip in the bond
market, while the stock markets roared ahead to a record-high close
a whisper away from the 3,000 mark.
   The reaction Monday _ or lack of one _ wasn't unusual, corporate
economists say, considering the executive branch's horrendous track
record on deficit figures.
   ``Private estimates both on Wall Street and elsewhere have been
very large, and the market knew that,'' said James L. Kochan, chief
bond market strategist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Kochan said White House budget reports ``have always been viewed
with a high degree of skepticism as being somewhat tainted or being
overly optimistic.''
   The White House increased its forecast of the deficit for the
fiscal year starting Oct. 1 to $168.8 billion _ $231.4 billion if
savings and loan bailout costs are counted.
   The figure is $10 billion higher than the Bush administration's
informal estimate of a month ago and up sharply from January's
$100.5 billion estimate.
   News of a greater deficit often weakens bond prices because it
implies the need for more government borrowing, which in turn can
drive up interest rates. Higher rates tend to decrease the value of
fixed-return investments such as bonds.
   But bond prices closed virtually unchanged Monday and remained
flat this morning. The stock market, meanwhile, continued its
rally. The Dow Jones industrial average closed Monday at 2,999.75,
up 19.55, and gained an additional 7.43 points in early trading
this morning, standing at 3,007.18 as of 11 a.m.
   Analysts said the stock market was driven by prospects of lower
interest rates, as well as by a belief that corporate profits for
the second quarter will be higher.
   Jerry Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los
Angeles, said Wall Street typically has two reactions to White
House projections of budget shortfalls, ``both a yawn for the
marke.''
   ``If the White House is simply coming up with projections that
are in line with what private forecasters have been saying, then it
doesn't affect the market,'' he said. ``If it's different than what
the consensus is, then we just disregard it because it's politics.''
   Besides, ``Everyone knows the White House doesn't have any
authority on budgetary matters,'' Jordan said, adding the real work
takes place in Congress.
   Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co., said the Congressional Budget Office came out with
figures in May that are similar to those released Monday by the
administration.
   ``The markets have learned to believe the Congressional Budget
Office. They tend to be more accurate,'' he said.
   The markets view the White House budget report as ``more of a
political than economic document,'' Kellner said.
   For example, he said, the report contains what he called an
optimistic rate of economic growth for next fiscal year, along with
lower interest rates.
   ``White House documents always seem to be rosy scenarios,'' he
said.
   Kochan of Merrill Lynch said the bond market in particular has
more on its mind these days than the budget shortfall. Chiefly it
is concerned with remarks last week by Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, who indicated the central bank may ease interest
rates to compensate for a perceived credit crunch in the banking
system.
   ``The bond markets have known for some time about how large the
budget deficit was going to be,'' Kochan said.

   Bridgette LeAnn Wilson of Oregon topped 50
other teen-agers to earn the Miss Teen USA crown in the eighth
annual pageant.
   ``I went in and I was going to give it my best shot, and
whatever my best was, I was going to hope for the best,'' said the
blonde, brown-eyed teen after her win Monday.
   The 16-year-old from Gold Beach said she hopes for a career in
entertainment.
   ``There are 51 beautiful girls here. I'm a sincere person, and I
believe in myself, and having my family here was a help,'' said
Wilson, who was crowned by 1989 Miss Teen USA Brandi Sherwood of
Idaho Falls, Idaho.
   Miss Alaska, Mar La Johnson, 18, of Anchorage was first
runner-up, and Miss Georgia, Holly Roehl, 17, of Griffin was second
runner-up.
   Sandy Duncan and Former Miss Teen finalist Leeza Gibbons, of
``Entertainment This Week,'' were co-hosts of the two-hour pageant
held at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum and televised nationwide.
   Wilson will receive more than $150,000 in cash and prizes,
including a car. Contestants competed in interviews, evening gown
and swimsuit events. Finalists also competed in an impromptu
interview.
   Wilson said she was unsure of what her year would include. ``I
don't know. This is pretty good so far. If it gets better, I can
hardly wait.''

critically injuring a 2-year-old girl and injuring seven others,
police said.
   The driver had been working on the van's brakes in the driveway

van, put it in gear, and drove through a gate and hit the children,
said police Lt. John Rohrbach.
   The driver was not charged while police investigate Monday's

   The injured girl, Tyree Davis, was in critical condition today
at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with a broken pelvis and
internal injuries.
   Three other children were hospitalized, and the others were

<TEXT>
   Infant bean bag cushions called ``Baby Comfy
Cushions'' sold by New Orleans-based Kalencom Corp. are being
recalled voluntarily because of a risk babies could suffocate, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission said today.
   Kalencom had sold about 8,000 of its fabric-covered, polystyrene
pellet-filled cushion since 1988. No reported deaths have been
linked to the Baby Comfy Cushions, but the commission said it has
received 29 reports that infants were found dead lying face-down on
similar cushions made by other manufacturers.
   Kalencom is the 11th company to recall infant bean bag cushions,
but the commission said it was concerned that only 11.5 percent of
such cushions that were sold have been accounted for.
   Baby Comfy Cushions can be returned for refund to the stores
where they were purchased, or buyers can return them directly to
Kalencom for an exchange for another baby product.
   To return the Baby Comfy Cushion to Kalencom, cut a six-inch
square from the product's cover and return it with the sewn-in
labels, including the manufacturer's name, to:
   The Kalencom Corp.
   740 Clouet Street
   New Orleans, La. 70117
   Consumers with questions can call Kalencom at (504) 943-0123 or

   A stray artillery shell accidentally exploded
today near a group of soldiers on a training exercise, killing five
and wounding 10, the army command said.
   Three of the wounded suffered serious injuries, the military
said.
   The accident occurred this morning when a reserve unit was
conducting an exercise involving the capture of a position at a
training base in southern Israel, it said. The military command
released no further details.
   Army officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
accident was at a military base near Tzeelim in the southern Negev
desert, 15 miles from the Egyptian border.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens and Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan
Shomron rushed to the scene to receive reports on the accident, the
military said.
   The injured soldiers were evacuated by helicopter to Hadassah
Hospital in Jerusalem and Soroka Hospital in nearby Beersheba.
   Dr. Haim Granot, head of Hadassah's emergency ward, said there
were six injured soldiers at the hospital, including one in serious
condition, one moderately wounded and four with slight injuries.
   Soroka officials told Israel army radio that the hospital was
treating two soldiers who suffered serious wounds and one trooper
in moderate condition. One soldier was released after treatment.
   The army said that head of its ground forces, Maj. Gen. Uri
Saguy, who was present at the exercise, appointed an investigation
committee headed by senior officers.
   Army officials said all those injured in the accident were
reserve soldiers. Israeli men under the age of 55 serve up to a
month each year on reserve duty, in addition to a compulsory three
years in the army starting at age 18.
   It was the most serious training accident in the Israeli army
since April 23, when seven airmen were killed as their transport
helicopters collided during a flight over the occupied West Bank.

<HEAD>Hitting the Water, Think Ahead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Olympic diving champion Greg Louganis sets a
good athletic example for many youngsters. For starters, he
cautions that they not just plunge in, but think ahead.
   ``Know the water depth before you dive,'' tops the list of
Louganis' diving tips.
   That sounds simple, and in pools the water depth may be marked
on the sid. But just looking into the water can be deceptive, and
in lakes and ponds care is especially important.
   Rocks, partly sunken logs and other hidden obstructions can lurk
beneath the surface. And the water may simply not be as deep as
people think.
   Never dive where you don't know the depth or where there may be
obstructions. Once a dive is started there is no time to change or
think.
   Remember, when diving down into water, steer up with hands.
   Never dive into an above-ground pool or into the shallow end of
any pool _ nine out of 10 diving injuries occur when people dive
into water less than six feet deep, according to the National
Swimming Pool Foundation.
   Often injuries follow when inexperienced people do back dives,
dive through objects such as inner tubes or try fancy dives.
   One crucial warning: never dive or swim alone.
   Anyone can get into trouble in the water and the best insurance
policy is a friend to pull you out if necessary.
   Children are particularly vulnerable, according to the National
Spa and Pool Institute. But the safety measure that best protects
them is simple, a watchful adult on hand at all times.
   Nothing can replace a watchful parent, grandparent, neighbor or
baby-sitter when it comes to make sure a child is safe in the water.
   It's easy for horseplay to get out of hand, so the American
Academy of Pediatrics urges setting rules around water. Running,
pushing and similar roughhousing should be banned.
   Be sure everyone leaves the water and finds a safe shelter in
the event of a thunderstorm also.
   Good fences make safe pools, ensuring that people can't get to
the pool, fall in and drown when no one is available to save them.
   Many communities have laws setting minimum sizes for pool
fences. At the least the Spa and Pool Institute recommends a
barrier tall enough to prevent youngsters from climbing over. And
don't place tables, chairs and other items nearby that could be
used to climb over the fence.
   Doors, gates and other entry points need secure latches.
   Finally, post the number for emergency assistance near the
telephone and learn to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation
just in case. In fact, make sure anyone who supervises the pool
knows CPR.

   Evicted from her two-year campsite,
protester Jacqueline Smith has set up a new sidewalk residence near
the Memphis motel where Martin Luther King Jr. was murdered. But
authorities said today that she may be evicted from there, too.
   Police Inspector David Dugger said police have issued a summons
accusing Ms. Smith of blocking a city sidewalk. Ms. Smith will have
a court hearing Sept. 5 and the city will seek an order for her
removal if she is found guilty, he said.
   Before the summons was announced, Ms. Smith had said she was
setting up a new camp because ``this protest must continue.''
   On Monday, sheriff's deputies enforcing a court order evicted
Ms. Smith from the construction site of a museum being built at the
Lorraine Motel. The construction company obtained the order last
week after convincing a judge that she was in the way.
   She had camped in front of the Lorraine since deputies evicted
her from the motel itself on March 2, 1988.
   The motel was shut down in January 1988 to make way for the
National Civil Rights Center, scheduled to open July 4, 1991.
   Ms. Smith, 39, contends that King's memory would be better
served if the Lorraine were used as housing for the homeless or
other social purpose, rather than as a museum.
   A half-dozen sheriff's deputies waded through about 50 gawkers,
news reporters and supporters of Ms. Smith to pluck her from a lawn
chair at her camp. Two female carried her across the street and
deposited her at the curb there.
   She did not resist and no one was arrested.
   Tom Marshall, a deputy chief with the Shelby County Sheriff's
Department, said the court order required only that she leave the
construction site.
   Construction workers moved her tent and other belongings into
the street and closed in a chain-link fence behind her.
   Shortly after the eviction, Ms. Smith re-established her camp
but on the opposite side of the small side street which runs in
front of the Lorraine.
   The Lorraine was crumbling in disrepair in 1982 when a group of
citizens brought it at a foreclosure auction. They spent the next
several years persuading the state, county and city governments to
built the museum.

<TEXT>
   More than 160 members of Congress expressed
support Tuesday for Iran's opposition movement, criticizing what
they called Tehran's ``medieval dictatorship.''
   Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif., initiated the letter to
Massoud Rajavi, leader of the Iraqi-based People's Mujahedeen of
Iran. It was signed by 100 House Democrats and 62 Republicans.
   The lawmakers offered condolences to Rajavi over the April
machine-gun killing of his brother Kazem Rajavi by an Iranian squad
in Switzerland.
   Swiss police have said that one or more Iranian government
services were involved in the assassination, but are continuing the
investigation.
   Rajavi's widow, Michelle, met here last week with Dymally and
other members of Congress to discuss allegations of the Iranian
government's involvement in the killing.
   ``Dr. Rajavi's assassination is but more proof of Tehran's
continuing insistence to use terrorism as the principal and
indispensable pillar of its foreign policy,'' the letter said.
``Decisiveness is required to confront Tehran's medieval
dictatorship.''
   The lawmakers asked Rajavi ``to assure your countrymen that we
support their peaceful and democratic aims'' of replacing the
government.
   The U.S. administration has had occasional contacts with the
Mujahedeen, partly in an effort to obtain information about events
in Iran. But it has refused to officially endorse the organization
or any other opposition group despite its acrimonious relationship
with the government in Tehran.
   Diplomatic ties with Iran were severed after the U.S. Embassy
staff was taken hostage in 1979 by the Islamic revolutionaries who
overthrew the pro-Western government of the late Shah Reza Pahlavi.
   Since then, the relationship has been confined to U.S. efforts
to obtain the release of American hostages held by Tehran-sponsored
Moslem Shiite extremists in Lebanon.
   U.S. officials have been disappointed that the death of Iran's
revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, has not seemed
to moderate the enmity toward the United States.
   The United States joined other countries in providing supplies
to help victims of the earthquake that killed an estimated 40,000
people last month. But Iranian officials said the U.S. help, while
appreciated, would not improve overall ties.
   ``One year after the death of Khomeini, the Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani has proven that he is as immoderate as Khomeini,
by continuing the repressive and terrorist policies of his
mentor,'' the lawmakers wrote.
   They also denounced a report issued last year by a special U.N.
envoy sent to investigate accusations of gross human rights
violations by the Iranian government. The team's findings were
described in the letter as ``a whitewash and a disgrace to the
United Nations.''

<HEAD>Ninety-One More Drug Addicts Found Infected With AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ninety-one more Chinese drug addicts living near
the drug-producing Golden Triangle have been diagnosed as infected
with the AIDS virus, the China Daily newspaper said Tuesday.
   The report comes five months after shocked Chinese officials
discovered 146 AIDS-infected drug addicts, the first in the nation,
also living in southwest China's Yunnan province near the Burma
border.
   China Daily quoted He Jiesheng, vice minister of public health,
as saying the 91 were infected through ``communal use of
contaminated syringes for intravenous injections.''
   She spoke at a national telephone conference on epidemic
control, held Monday, the newspaper said.
   The report gave no other details of the new AIDS cases, such as
whether any of the infected persons had symptoms of the disease.
None of the previously discovered 146 people had any symptoms,
authorities have said.
   Before the first group of drug addicts were discovered, China
said only seven of its nationals were known to have become infected
with the virus. Of these, two died.
   In addition, China periodically reports the expulsion of
foreigners found to be infected. So far, China has discovered 305
people infected with the virus, including foreigners and Chinese,
the newspaper said.
   All foreigners studying or working in China must take AIDS
tests, and any foreigner applying to marry a Chinese citizen also
must be tested. Chinese students studying abroad also are tested
when they return home.

   More than 100 people died of meningitis
this year but the disease has not assumed epidemic proportions, a
senior Health Ministry official said Tuesday.
   Dr. Sadek Mahjoub, director of the ministry's epidemics
department, said his office registered 1,012 cases of meningitis
since the beginning of the year. So far, 111 people have died.
   In 1988, about 32,000 people contracted meningitis and 2,000 of
them died. This prompted the government to launch a nationwide
vaccination drive.
   ``Most of the cases this year occurred in displaced persons
camps and remote areas that were not covered by the vaccination
program,'' Mahjoub told the state-owned newspaper Al-Inkaz
Al-Watani.
   The refugee problem was created by a 7-year-old civil war in the
south. Rebels have been fighting for greater autonomy and a larger
share of the country's economic benefits.
   More than half the 6 million inhabitants of the southern regions
of Bahr el-Ghazal, Equatoria and Upper Nile have been displaced by
the fighting and famine.

   Soldiers and civilians battled a forest

   The fire, which began Monday afternoon, had destroyed more than

   ``No places frequented by tourists are under threat and no

   A police operation involving French, Dutch and

sulphate, the drug known as ``speed,'' police said Tuesday.
   Eleven men were arrested Monday when police and customs officers
raided a boat at the mouth of the Thames River, 40 miles east of
London, Kent police said.
   Police fired a stun grenade but no one was injured in the raid,
which recovered 132 pounds of the drug worth up to $18 million,
said Kent police Chief Inspector Alan Butterfield.
   Five of the men were arrested as they unloaded the motor
cruiser, Merulius, which had sailed from Holland on Friday under
surveillance by coast guard vessels, police said.
   Customs officers and police arrested six other people in London.
The arrests capped a three-month investigation, code-named
Operation Tributary. Butterfield called it the largest seizure ever
in Great Britain.

   In the heart of the white

stuffed doll.
   Priced at $38, the two-foot high Winnie doll comes complete with
headdress, gold-colored hoop earrings, an African print dress and
lots of jewelry.
   Mrs. Mandela, wife of African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela, has been a controversial anti-apartheid activist known for
her provocative statements and flashy outfits.
   Capitalizing on Mrs. Mandela's notoriety, two young white design
students have been handmaking the Winnie dolls and selling them at
an upscale shopping mall in the affluent white suburbs of
Johannesburg.
   Mrs. Mandela, once called ``Mother of the Nation'' by her black
supporters, was expelled from the anti-apartheid movement last year
after her bodyguards were accused of waging a ``reign of terror''
in the Soweto township outside Johannesburg.
   She has been re-accepted by anti-apartheid groups since her
husband was released from prison in February.

   A radio talk show host who was suspended
for banning black callers returned to the air Tuesday after his
station manager said his action was not malicious.
   Tim Lennox, suspended Thursday, returned to the air on WERC-AM.
   But station manager Berkley Fraser said Lennox was removed from
his job as news director and will be on probation for a year.
   Lennox also will be required to develop, produce and serve as
host of a special series for the station on the topic ``Birmingham
faces the future,'' focusing on race relations in the city.
   Lennox said early in his two-hour talk show on July 11 that he
would take no calls from blacks that day. Lennox imposed the ban
after three employees saw a black youth break into an fellow
employee's car and take her purse.
   Lennox, 40, said later he made ``an emotional spur-of-the-moment
decision.''
   He and Fraser issued on-air apologies. On Thursday's
pre-suspension show, Lennox fielded listener reactions without
commenting on them.
   Fraser said Monday his investigation showed that Lennox's black
ban was ``not based in malice and his 14-year career was without
incidence of any racial prejudice.''

   President Bush today said that both Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl showed ``exceptional qualifies of leadership'' in agreeing
that a reunified Germany can join NATO.
   Bush, who had lengthy telephone conversations with both leaders
this morning, also took credit for spurring the process that led to
Monday's announcement from the Soviet Union.
   ``The United States has been in the forefront in suggesting that
the best way to achieve stabilization and peace would be a united
Germany, a unified Germany as a full fledged member of NATO,'' Bush
said a day after Kohl and Gorbachev took center stage for an
announcement that many U.S. officials had not expected until months
down the road.
   ``Both Kohl and Gorbachev have displayed, I think, exceptional
qualities of leadership during this challenging period,'' Bush told
a gathering of the Magazine Publishers of America who visited the
White House.
   The president said he had telephoned both Kohl and Gorbachev
this morning for ``fairly long conversations'' of 30 to 40 minutes
each.
   ``I feel that the agreement that was announced yesterday between
Gorbachev and Kohl was very, very significant and very important,''
he said of the announcement that Moscow would not oppose a unified
Germany in NATO.
   Bush said also that he commended Gorbachev on the outcome of the
recent stormy Communist Party congress in Moscow.
   ``You talk about a guy getting hit from all sides,'' Bush said
in reference to attacks on the Soviet president from both left and
right and the splintering of the party. Bush said it made him feel
`totally relaxed about what's happening in this country.''
   He recalled his meetings with Kohl, and with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, French President Francois Mitterrand as
well as with Gorbachev as laying the groundwork and reaching
consensus on the German reunification question.
   ``I take pride in the way Europe is moving into this new era of
freedom,'' Bush said. ``We've still got some very important
problems that lie out there ahead of us.''

   President Bush today gave NASA Administrator
Richard Truly a vote of confidence for running the troubled agency.
Truly predicted space shuttle flights will resume within a month
now that scientists have identified unrelated hydrogen leaks on two
of the vehicles.
   ``I have great confidence in Dick Truly ... so lay that part of
the question to rest,'' Bush said, explaining the administration's
decision to have a panel of outside experts look at NASA's
long-range plans.
   ``I have confidence in NASA,'' Bush added. ``It's a perilous
business, I guess, anytime you put people up there into space, but
the record has been very good.''
   Bush spoke at a question-and-answer session with magazine
publishers. Separately, Truly appeared on ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' and discussed problems leading to the grounding of the
space shuttles.
   The president said he ``went semi-ballistic'' when he read
weekend news reports suggesting there would be an investigation of
NASA.
   ``What we are doing is asking him (Truly) to form an outside
committee of the best minds he can find to look at the future _ not
go try to assign blame because a mission is delayed getting off the
ground,'' Bush said.
   ``These shots are highly complex,'' the president added. ``We
have been the leaders in space and I want to see us continue to be
the leaders in space.''
   Truly said recent problems with the space shuttle turned out to
be less complicated than originally feared.
   ``As it turned out, it was just the terrible coincidence of two
separate, specific leaks. We have found them both and now, since it
did involve two orbiters and two payloads, we're now just looking
at schedules to see what is the most effective way to get back to
flight.''
   He said a new flight schedule probably will be announced later
today or tomorrow, and predicted that flights will resume by
mid-August or the first of September.
   ``The system didn't go down for three years like it did after
Challenger, it went down for three or four weeks,'' he said.
   NASA grounded the space shuttle fleet after a hydrogen leak was
found in Columbia in May and another leak was found on Atlantis
last month. Columbia, which had been poised for launch on an
astronomy mission, was rolled back to the hanger and partially
dismantled. The part that was leaking has now been replaced.
Atlantis remains on the pad and NASA officials said its leak may be
repaired without taking the shuttle back to the hangar.
   Truly acknowledged that problems with the shuttle and the Hubble
telescope could prompt the public to question NASA's competence,
but said a management review panel announced Monday is intended to
look at long-range plans rather than second-guess recent problems.
   He said Vice President Dan Quayle ``fully understands that these
recent events have been separate events that didn't have anything
to do with each other.''
   ``What we talked about most was the future, where we're going in
future years and how a NASA of the future might be structured and
how we could get advice on where it would move to,'' said Truly.
``We agreed to do something we both thought was the right thing to
do and that is get in a few people that have some real top
experience in both government and industry management and report to
me and take a look at where we might go in the future.''
   However, the Bush administration's decision to have an outside
panel study the nation's long-term space goals is getting a cool
reception from some lawmakers.
   ``After a weekend of rumors that the administration was going to
ask some fundamental questions about NASA, we now find it will
create yet another group,'' said Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn.,
chairman of a subcommittee that oversees the space program.
   The panel, which is being appointed in response to a spate of
recent embarrassments to the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, will report to Quayle, head of the National Space
Council.
   ``Is it too much to ask that in the wake of these multiple
mistakes that President Bush should do what President Reagan did
not do after the Challenger tragedy _ give personal attention to
the problems at NASA,'' Gore sad.
   Rep. Michael Andrews, D-Texas, also said strong leadership, not
another study, is needed to solve the problems in the space program.
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., chairwoman of the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee that has oversight responsibility for
NASA, summoned Truly and former space agency Administrator James
Beggs to a hearing Wednesday.
   NASA needs congressional support to continue the $32 billion
space station scheduled for a critical design review this year, a
planned Earth study called ``Mission to Planet Earth,'' and the
president's announced goal of a permanent manned base on the moon
and an expedition to Mars.
   The agency's setbacks in recent months included the finding that
one or both of the mirrors on the Hubble Space Telescope were
ground incorrectly, making a precise focus of the telescope
impossible. In addition, the space shuttle fleet has been grounded
while engineers pursue leaks that were discovered when two of the
three orbiters were being fueled.
   There were reports last weekend that Bush planned to restructure
the agency. But the decision announced by Quayle's office was far
less sweeping: a study by experts who have not yet been named.
   ``Contrary to some published reports, there is no White House
investigation of NASA,'' the statement said.
   It said the administration was calling for the outside study
because ``we all want the best ideas on how we can move into the
next century maintaining our leadership in space.''

   The FBI has gathered tape-recorded evidence

   The FBI has amassed ``mountains of evidence'' against Gotti and
the Gambino crime family hierarchy, including conversations that

Castellano, the Daily News reported.
   The new evidence includes taped conversations of Gotti and his

investigation, the News quoted unidentified sources as saying.
   The sources did not indicate where the bugs were placed or to

   Gotti has been under investigation in the death of rival mob
boss Castellano since the Dec. 16, 1985, killing outside of a
Manhattan steakhouse.
   Gotti, known to tabloid readers as the ``Dapper Don'' because of
his fondness for expensive suits, was found innocent in February of
state charges related to the shooting of a union official. It was
the third time in that he had been acquitted in recent years of
major state or federal charges.

<TEXT>
   Andrew Young, bidding to become Georgia's first
black governor, competed Tuesday in a genteel five-way Democratic
primary that seemed likely to send him into a runoff against Lt.
Gov. Zell Miller.
   Young, a one-time aide to Martin Luther King Jr. who went on to
be a congressman, ambassador to the United Nations and mayor of
Atlanta, hoped to follow in the footseps of L. Douglas Wilder of
Virginia. Wilder last year became the nation's first elected black
governor.
   Early indications Tuesday pointed to a moderate turnout.
Election officials had predicted about a third of the state's
registered voters would take part in the primary.
   The campaign was notably short on mudslinging or negative
advertising. Race was mentioned far less than such issues as
abortion, legalized gambling and the economy.
   Recent polls showed Young running slightly behind Miller, a
moderate who has enjoyed black support in his 16 years in the
state's No. 2 job.
   Georgia law provides for an Aug. 7 runoff between the top two
candidates, unless one wins a majority in the primary.
   Young predicted Monday he would run more strongly in
predominantly white areas than pollsters and other observers
expected.
   ``A lot of people who say I couldn't get votes in south Georgia
have implied there's something backward about south Georgia, and I
think they've underestimated south Georgia again,'' he said in
Columbus. ``We're going to surprise people in where we get votes.''
   About 25 percent of Georgia's voting age population is black.
   Miller, 58, made himself the principal advocate of an issue of
growing popularity in the state _ legalization of a state lottery.
   Young, also 58, stressed his experience traveling the world to
bring business to Atlanta and said economic development was a cause
that could bring blacks and whites together.
   On Monday, Young suggested that Miller was too combative to get
his lottery proposal through the Legislature. Young said he would
persuade the Legislature to let voters decide the idea, although he
personally opposes it.
   Young and Miller supported abortion rights. State Sen. Roy
Barnes, 42, third in opinion polls, advocated restrictions on
abortion and called Young and Miller ``tax and spend liberals.''
   The Democratic field also included state Rep. Lauren ``Bubba''
McDonald, 51, and former Gov. Lester Maddox, the 74-year-old
one-time arch segregationist.
   Black officials, supported by the American Civil Liberties Union
but not by Young, had sued to block a runoff, complaining that it
discriminated against blacks. But U.S. District Judge Richard
Freeman on Tuesday rejected their request to halt runoffs until the
lawsuit is decided.
   In the Republican primary, state Rep. Johnny Isakson, 45, a real
estate executive from the north Atlanta suburbs, was a heavy
favorite against three challengers. The well-financed Isakson is
regarded as the most serious Republican threat in years to the
Democratic lock on the governor's mansion.
   The only congressional incumbent with primary opposition was
Rep. Doug Barnard, a Democrat from Augusta, who serves on the House
Banking Committee and was accused by opponents of being too cozy
with savings and loan officials. Barnard was opposed by journalism
student Scott A. Starling of Athens. Two Republicans sought to
oppose him in November.
   J.B. Stoner, a white supremacist who served time in prison for
the bombing of a black church in Alabama, ran for the Democratic
nomination for lieutenant governor, but he was not regarded as a
serious contender. Eight other Democrats were in the race.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Gov. Joe Frank Harris is completing the state limit
of two four-year terms, and remained neutral in the primary.
   Young, borrowing from Wilder's strategy in Virginia, linked
himself strongly to the pro-choice cause, using television ads late
in the campaign to go after votes of abortion rights supporters.
   Miller, too, staked out a pro-choice position, as did McDonald.
Only Maddox and Barnes positioned themselves against abortion
rights.
   Barnes attacked Miller with a ``Willie Horton'' tactic. He
accused the lieutenant governor of voting 16 years ago, as a member
of the state clemency board, to free a prisoner who later committed
murder.
   Miller said he acted on 4,000 cases and didn't remember that one.
   Horton, a convicted murderer in Massachusetts who fled while on
a weekend furlough and later was accused of rape, was used by
Republicans during the 1988 presidential campaign to depict Gov.
Michael Dukakis as soft on crime.

   A motel maid's discovery of $42,000 led to the
investigation of a marijuana trafficking operation and the
indictment of six men, authorities said.
   The Boulder-based organization allegedly imported nearly 100,000
pounds of marijuana into the United States between 1978 and 1988.
   ``It is an incredibly large, well-financed, terrorist-oriented
organization,'' said U.S. Attorney Mike Norton in announcing the
federal indictment Monday.
   ``This case rivals any marijuana case in the country'' in size
and scope, said FBI agent Chuck Evans.
   About $10 million in cash, gold, art works, rare coins and other
valuables have been impounded from the group, authorities said. The
assets were seized from storage lockers in Colorado and Arizona.
   The indictment under the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt
Organizations statute accuses Robert A. Mackesy, 40, and five
others of operating a continuing criminal enterprise. They also are
charged with possession with intent to distribute marijuana.
   According to the indictment, Mackesy headed an organization that
bought marijuana from Miguel Angel Caro-Quintero, younger brother
of Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro-Quintero. The elder Caro-Quintero
is charged in the 1985 torture and slaying of U.S. drug agent
Enrique Camarena.
   The man alleged to be a distributor of the marijuana, Douglas
McPheron, left $42,000 in a Boulder motel room while he ran
errands, Norton said. A maid came across the money and turned it
over to police in July 1988.
   Four of the six men indicted are in custody.
   Perry said he has been in touch with U.S. Drug Enforcement
Agency agents in Mexico who will work with the Mexican government
to apprehend Miguel Caro-Quintero, who was named in the indictment.

<HEAD>Woman Says She Gave Barry Cocaine Week Or Two Before The Vista
Sting</HEAD>

   A woman testified today at Marion Barry's drug
and perjury trial that she started giving cocaine to the mayor in
1983 and last provided it to him a week or two before his Jan. 18
arrest in an FBI sting operation.
   The reluctant prosecution witness, Bettye Smith, flew to
Washington earlier in the day by order of a U.S. magistrate in
Chattanooga, Tenn., where she had been undergoing treatment for
stress at a psychiatric hospital.
   Testifying under a court order, Smith told the jury at Barry's
trial that she and the mayor snorted cocaine powder at her
residence on Capitol Hill ``maybe five times'' in 1983 and up to
half a dozen times in each succeeding year.
   But she said ``we skipped'' the latter part of 1987 and all of
1988 after press coverage surrounding a Thanksgiving 1987 trip
Barry made to the Bahamas. Smith was in the Bahamas with Barry and
other friends.
   ``I didn't see him for a while after that trip,'' she said. In
the earlier years, she said, Barry used cocaine in front of her in
her home. Starting in 1986, she said, the mayor took it into the
bathroom alone.
   Early this January was the last time she offered cocaine to him,
she said. The mayor took a package of cocaine into the bathroom and
after a short time came out again and handed the package back to
her, she said.
   On Jan. 18, former model Rasheeda Moore persuaded Barry to come
to her room at the Vista Hotel, where the mayor was arrested after
being videotaped smoking crack cocaine.
   Moore was a former girlfriend of Barry's. Smith said that she
and Barry were close friends, but that their relationship was ``not
a sexual friendship.''
   On cross-examination by Barry's lawyers, sh said she never saw
Barry use or have possession of cocaine in the Bahamas. And she
said she never provided the mayor with crack, a particular form of
cocaine.
   Smith's attorney had asked that the magistrate delay her
transfer to Washington. He presented a letter from her doctor
stating that travel might be dangerous because of her mental and
emotional state.
   In Washington, U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
on Monday ordered the execution of a bench warrant for Smith, who
had been scheduled to testify last week until she was hospitalized
in Chattanooga.
   Testimony by the woman, a friend of Barry, would relate to one
of the 14 criminal charges against Barry, that he possessed cocaine
between Jan. 1 and Jan. 18 of this year.
   Barry is accused of 10 cocaine possession counts, one count of
conspiracy and three counts of lying to a grand jury. The first 11
are misdemeanors, the last three felonies.
   Prosecutors say they will end their case with the testimony of
Smith and Doris Crenshaw, another friend of the mayor.
   The defense is preparing to open its case Wednesday and plans
testimony from 10 to 15 witnesses, said Mundy.
   Attorneys outside the case said the only effective way to defend
the mayor is to focus on the aggressive tactics the government used
to prosecute him. Several said emphatically that Barry himself
should not take the stand.
   The defense should emphasize the contention that ``if he weren't
the mayor they wouldn't have come after him,'' said G. Allen Dale,
a private attorney who handles drug cases.
   Former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova, who pursued several
criminal investigations of Barry, said the mayor ``would be
destroyed'' on cross-examination if put on the witness stand in his
own defense. DiGenova now is a lawyer in private practice. Barry's
attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, said no decision has been made on
whether Barry will testify.

<HEAD>U.S. Pledges Aid to Fight Deadly Fly in Libya</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States on Tuesday pledged $3 million to
help Libya fight a deadly fly infestation that is a potential
threat to wildlife and livestock in much of Africa.
   The United States led other nations in committing funds, but the
fund-raising effort fell far short of the money needed to carry out
the eradication, U.N. officials said.
   So far, the screw-worm fly has not spread beyond northern Libya,
where it was first spotted in July 1988. But experts say it could
spread quickly.
   A conference had aimed at raising $91.7 million, according to
its organizers, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the
International Fund for Agricultural Development.
   But only $31 million was pledged at the conference, which was
attended by representatives from 26 nations, a statement by the two
Rome-based agencies said.
   In addition to the money sought by the conference, Libya will
provide $25 million, organizers said.
   The eradication plan calls for unleashing tens of millions of
sterilized screw-worm flies in Libya. Matings then will yield no
offspring and the insect, which eats away at the flesh of its
victims, will die out.
   Despite the failure to raise all the funds, the sterile fly
release is expected to get under way in September, a FAO official
said.
   U.S. sanctions against Libya, including a ban on American travel
there, complicated planning to wipe out the fly. U.S. technology is
needed to carry out the program, and supervision by American
experts was considered essential to its success.
   After delicate discussions, Washington agreed to allow both the
technology and personnel to go to Libya.
   U.S. officials said they agreed to help for humanitarian reasons
and because an international organization will carry it out.
   West Germany pledged the equivalent of $2.7 million, followed by
Britain, with a $1.8-million pledge.

   A woman who was nearly killed in an attack in
Central Park climbed unsteadily onto the witness stand to describe
the lasting effects of an assault she does not remember.
   The 30-year-old investment banker testified Monday that her
battered body gives her constant reminders of the attack 15 months
ago. As the trial continued today, a detective testified that one
of the defendants admitted participating but said he did not rape
the woman.
   The woman, whose identify is not being disclosed by the media
because of the nature of the assault, was making her first public
appearance at the trial of three teen-agers accused of taking part
in the so-called ``wilding'' attack.
   On the witness stand, she listed lingering physical problems,
including impaired balance, loss of her sense of smell and vision
troubles. Despite plastic surgery, she has long, jagged scar on the
side of her face where she was beaten into submission.
   Antron McCray, Raymond Santana and Yusef Salaam, all 16, are
charged with attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse, assault, robbery
and riot in separate attacks on the woman and two men who were
jogging through the park on the night of April 19, 1989.
   Today, Police Detective Humberto Arroyo testified that he took a
statement from Santana in the presence of his grandmother the day
after the attack.
   Santana said that Kevin Richardson threw the jogger to the
ground and had sex with her, and that Steven Lopez beat her with a
brick. Richardson and Lopez are among three youths who are to be
tried later.
   ``When she was on the floor, I grabbed her (breasts),'' Santana
said in the statement. ``I did not have sex with her,''
   In the statement as recounted by Arroyo, Santana told how he and
other youths convened northeast of Central Park the evening of the
attack, with the plan of robbing joggers and cyclists.
   In cross-examination, the defense said the boy should not have
been questioned only in the presence of his grandmother because she
does not speak English well. But Arroyo said he read Santana his
rights in Spanish as well as English.
   As the woman testified Monday, the defendants looked at their
hands, fiddled with pens or stared into space. She was on the stand
about 10 minutes.
   Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer showed the woman
the T-shirt she was wearing when she was attacked. It is now almost
completely brown with dried blood.
   ``That's the shirt that I used to wear,'' the woman said.
   Police have testified that the T-shirt was used to bind and gag
the woman while she was raped and bludgeoned.
   The woman has recovered enough to return to work at Salomon
Brothers Inc.
   State Judge Thomas B. Galligan told the sketch artists in court
not to portray the woman clearly. He said her worries about being
identified from sketches were justified.
   She said she did not remember entering the park to run the night
she was assaulted and her first memory afterward was waking up in
the hospital on Memorial Day weekend.
   Defense attorneys did not cross-examine the woman.
   ``In the long run, I think her testimony helps us, the fact that
she came in and couldn't identify any of the defendants, and could
not even (remember) going to the park,'' Santana's lawyer, Peter
Rivera, said outside court.
   The three youths are being tried in an adult court, but if
convicted they will be sentenced as juvenile offenders to up to 10
years in prison.

<HEAD>Forests Burning Across Northwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of reinforcements poured into the rugged backcountry of
the Boise National Forest in Idaho today as stiff wind and low
humidity fanned forest fires across the Northwest.
   Forests also burned in Oregon, Washington, Montana and Wyoming.
   In west-central Idaho, the Mormon Creek Fire had leaped fire
lines in steep terrain and quadrupled in size since Monday to 450
acres. It flared up Sunday from embers left from a lightning strike
last week.
   ``Everything we had built yesterday we lost,'' Boise forest
spokeswoman Jennifer Callan said. ``It was pretty gusty up there
today.''
   An additional 200 firefighters were sent to join the more than
100 already at work on the blaze. Two air tankers bombarded the
blaze with flame retardant and helicopters dumped water.
   Wind blowing at 20 mph was blamed for swelling the Gird Point
fire in the Bitterroot National Forest in southwestern Montana to
2,500 acres this morning, five times its size Monday night.
   Because of the fire near Hamilton, officials closed a highway
and evacuated twqo campgrounds.
   Some 450 firefighters were on the lines today in rugged terrain.
The fire was started Friday by a lightning strike. Smaller fires
were reported northeast of Missoula and in the Kootenai National
Forest of northwestern Montana.
   Stiff wind and low humidity also were reported in Oregon, where
fires triggered by lightning last week had charred more than 4,000
acres and some were still spreading, authorities said.
   The Spring Butte fire near La Pine, Ore., grew to 935 acres
Monday while smoldering brush on the Warm Springs Indian
Reservation re-ignited and burned about 145 acres. The Corral Basin
blaze near John Day, Ore., had destroyed 900 acres, according to
state and federal fire managers.
   About 430 firefighters battled the Spring Butte blaze and 780
were at work on the Corral Basin fire, with an additional 240
called in, officials said.
   ``Weather forecasts indicate a shift to southwest wind with
increasing velocity. This will cause major problems for
firefighters,'' said Jennifer Harris of the Malheur National Forest.
   About 65 fires, most small and set by lightning, were burning
across Washington state in the Wenatchee and Okanogan national
forests. The largest had covered about 300 acres in a wilderness
area of the Wenatchee forest.
   Firefighters in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming were still
trying today to contain a 15-acre fire north of Yellowstone Lake.
And two firefighters were sent to battle the park's 14th fire of
the season, a 40-foot-diameter blaze started by lightning Monday
night.
   Elsewhere, while nearly a week of rain in Alaska's interior gave
firefighters a needed break, the return of warm and dry conditions
has state and federal lands officials warily watching the weather.
   Despite the rain, 115 fires continue to burn in Alaska, down
from a high of more than 200 last week, said Sue Mitchell, a
spokeswoman for the federal Bureau of Land Management. On Sunday,
more than 670,000 acres of Alaska were burning, she said.
   Near San Jose, Calif., fire officials declared a 2,140-acre
brush and grass fire 100 percent contained today and estimated that
it would be completely out by the end of the day.

<HEAD>Court Widens Jurisdiction of Prosecutor in HUD Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The court that oversees independent counsels
today widened the jurisdiction of the special prosecutor
investigating allegations of political favoritism by former Housing
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
   The jurisdiction of independent counsel Arlin M. Adams was
widened to include Pierce's administration of the Urban Development
Action Grant Program and the Secretary's Discretionary Fund for
technical assistance and special projects.
   Adams was appointed March 1 to investigate allegations that
Pierce and top aides conspired to defraud the government by showing
political favoritism in the operation of the Moderate
Rehabilitation Program.
   The court's order made public today expanded Adams' jurisdiction
along the lines requested by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to
include the operation of the two other programs.
   Thornburgh sought the expanded jurisdiction after the Justice
Department reviewed the congressional testimony of DuBois L.
Gilliam, a former assistant HUD secretary who told lawmakers that
politics was an important criteria for awarding grants through UDAG
and the discretionary fund.
   The court said in a statement that it had also ``moderately
expanded'' Adams' jurisdiction to investigate the Moderate
Rehabilitation Program. The statement did not specify how that
jurisdiction was changed.
   Pierce, who headed the Department of Housing and Urban
Development under President Reagan, has denied any wrongdoing in
the award of grants or rent subsidies.
   But Gilliam and other witnesses told a House Government
Operations subcommittee that grants went to politically connected
developers.

   No more adding in your head, trying to
figure whether that last $10 bill will cover five frozen dinners
and a bag of dog food.
   Supermarkets in three states have been testing grocery carts
equipped with calculators to help coupon-clipping consumers keep
within their budgets. That is, if they can get the gadgets to work.
   Publix, which owns 370 Florida supermarkets, bolted 200
calculators to cart handles at a new store in Lakeland and 156
others to baskets at an established Clearwater store near a
sprawling retirement complex.
   The sites were picked for their diverse customers, said Bob
McDermott, spokesman for Publix, the nation's eighth-largest
supermarket chain.
   In a random sampling of some 30 shoppers at the Clearwater
store, people said they liked the idea, but often found the gadget
a hassle.
   Some shoppers didn't know how to use the checkbook-size device,
which has a keypad and display window on one side and advertising
space on the other. Others got it to work, but with mixed results.
   ``I tried using it,'' said Vicki Bartholomew, an insurance
worker with six items in her basket: a melon, cat food, potatoes,
grapes, coffee and cottage cheese.
   ``My total came up to $109.30, and I run a computer at work,''
she said.
   Julie Snider, a retiree who moved to Florida from Denver 10
years ago, said ``they'd be great if they worked properly.''
   ``Three times I started the darn thing and something screws up
and it's back to zero,'' she said. ``They shouldn't do that to
aggravate the old people.''
   But coupon shopper Gail Schueren is a believer.
   ``I love them,'' she said. ``I don't have to worry about whether
I have a scrap of paper and a pencil to keep track of the
discounts. And so far in a couple of weeks I've only run into one
that didn't work right.''
   The shopper calculator is marketed by ADDvantage Media Group of
Tulsa, Okla., which during the past two years has tested the device
in Oklahoma and Alaska. The Florida tests began about two months
ago.
   The retailer pays from $13 to $25 for each calculator, depending
on how many it buys. The advertising space is meant to make up for
the cost.
   The calculators being tested in Florida are already obsolete and
upgraded ones should arrive in August or September, said Mike
Brennan, vice president of ADDvantage.
   ``We've researched it and we also have to have instructional
posters to help people understand what to do,'' he said. ``We've
made significant changes. The new ones have a new keypad, new chip
and new design.''

<HEAD>Army Captain Assassinated; Military Blames Leftists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An army captain was shot to
death and his wife was wounded Tuesday in an ambush that the
military blamed on leftist guerrillas.
   Capt. Ramon Aristides Reyes Hernandez was gunned down in the
town of Santa Tecla, seven miles from the capital, as he was
getting into a car, the armed forces press office said.
   His wife, Cecilia Sandoval de Reyes, was treated at a San
Salvador hospital for gunshot wounds to the left leg and right arm,
the armed forces said.
   Witnesses told The Associated Press that two men on a motorcycle
fired on the couple and fled.
   The armed forces press office blamed the attack on guerrillas
from the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which
has been at war with a series of U.S.-backed governments for the
past decade. More than 70,000 people have died in the conflict.
   Reyes Hernandez, an instructor at the national military school,
was the second army officer to be assassinated this month. On July
9, Mayor Carlos Figueroa Morales, the head of the high command's
legal staff, was slain in an attack also blamed on the leftist
guerrillas.
   The armed forces said in a statement that the attacks will not
contribute to the search for peace. The government and the
guerrillas have scheduled another round of peace talks later this
week in San Jose, Costa Rica.

<HEAD>Army Conducting Espionage Investigation of 6 AWOL Soldiers; No
Charges Filed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GULF BREEZE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six Army soldiers missing from their
posts with an intelligence unit in West Germany have been
apprehended in Florida as a result of a traffic violation and are
under investigation, authorities said.
   ``Due to the fact they had access to classified materials within
the last six months a counter-intelligence investigation has been
initiated,'' Maj. Joe Padilla, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon,
said Monday.
   Bob Hall, a spokesman for Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, said
the counterintelligence investigation was routine, in the sense
that it is required in cases involving people with access to
classified information. He said he could not comment beyond saying:
``The Army says this does not appear to be an espionage case.''
   No charges had yet been filed against the six soldiers, Padilla
said. He said no decision had been made on whether the
absent-without-authorization allegation would encompass absent
without leave or the more serious charge of desertion.
   All six were from the 701st Military Intelligence Brigade at
Augsburg, West Germany. Padilla said he could not say exactly what
jobs they performed at the 701st, but said their training was in
analyzing foreign communications.
   Hall said the disappearance of the six ``came to our attention''
on July 9. He would not say whether that was when they left West
Germany. He and Padilla both said they did not know how the six got
to Florida from West Germany or what they were doing in Gulf Breeze.
   Padilla said the six are believed to belong to an organization
called ``The End of the World,'' but he said he had no information
about the group and could not say if it had any significance in the
investigation.
   The soldiers were taken to the stockade at Fort Benning, Ga.,
said Padilla.
   A police officer in this Florida Panhandle city stopped a van
late Friday because its tail lights were not working, said police
Chief Jerry Brown.
   The driver of the van had no driver's license, and warrants
showed he was listed Thursday as wanted for desertion from the
Army, Brown said.
   After officers called the Pensacola Naval Air Station police to
have the man picked up, the Navy called back to say he was
traveling with five other Army soldiers _ four men and a woman _
who also were wanted, Brown said.
   Soon after, representatives of the FBI, the CIA and the National
Security Agency also called, Brown said.
   Police learned that the five might be at a Gulf Breeze couple's
home, where the four men were arrested Saturday.
   Police then learned that the woman was staying at a campground
on the Gulf Island National Seashore near Fort Pickens, where she
was arrested, Brown said.

<HEAD>L.A. School Board Appoints New Superintendent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The school board has appointed William Anton,
a longtime administrator, as superintendent. He is the first Latino
to head the nation's second-largest school district.
   At a closed meeting Monday, the board also approved spending an
estimated $225,000 to buy out the remaining 11 months of
Superintendent Leonard Britton's contract.
   Britton, 59, announced last week he was quitting the
$164,555-a-year job. He said he would leave as of June 30, 1991.
The buyout would include salary and unused vacation time.
   Anton, a 65-year-old deputy superintendent, accepted a
three-year contract, and will take over Friday.
   ``I believe he has good leadership skills, and that is
important,'' said Mark Slavkin, one of six board members who voted
for Anton. ``If anyone can bring this district together at this
critical time, Bill is the one to do that.''
   Julie Korenstein was the lone board member to vote against the
appointment.
   ``It was simply railroaded through,'' she said. ``The board did
not do any interviewing, except for one person. I think the process
stunk.''
   The district also should not have bought out Britton's contract
during the current budget crisis, she said. The board recently cut
$220 million from its 1990-91 budget.
   Britton, who previously was superintendent of the Dade County,
Fla. school system, was the first superintendent to be hired from
outside the Los Angeles district in 40 years.
   Anton, who began his career in the district as a teacher in
1952, was passed up as superintendent in favor of Britton three
years ago.
   In November, Anton announced he was retiring, but withdrew the
letter at the urging of many district workers, teachers, parents
and community members.
   As superintendent, he will have to contend with the budget, an
ethnically diverse student population, overcrowded schools, and
calls to break up the 610,000-student district into smaller units.
   ``One of my big challenges is to be sure it doesn't happen,'' he
said.

   Subliminal messages such as ``try suicide,''
``let's be dead'' and ``do it'' in a song by the heavy metal band
Judas Priest led two young men to shoot themselves in a suicide
pact, their parents' lawyers say.
   Members of the British rock group deny any such messages were
hidden in their music.
   They and CBS Records are being sued by parents of the men,
Raymond Belknap and James Vance.
   The parents contend the young men hatched the suicide plot as
they drank, smoked marijuana and listened to the album ``Stained
Class'' _ and particularly the song ``Better By You, Better Than
Me'' _ in 1985.
   ``What pushed the boys over the edge to eternity was the
subliminal push,'' Vivian Lynch, the Vance family's attorney, said
during opening arguments Monday. ``This was not a suicide. This was
an adventure _ a journey to a better place. What they planned was
good, because Judas Priest said it was good.''
   ``There is no subliminal content on the `Stained Class' album,''
countered defense attorney Suellen Fulstone. ``I say that
unequivocally and we will prove that unequivocally.''
   The non-jury trial is being heard by state District Judge Jerry
Carr Whitehead.
   Vance's mother, Phyllis, testified today that her son found
religion in 1983 at a Christian camp and threw away his collection
of rock albums.
   But she said he turned belligerent when he again began listening
to Judas Priest's music.
   ``He'd attack me like a dog'' when she tried to turn off the
music, which he played so loud it could be heard down the street,
she said.
   ``I was embarrassed,'' she said. ``I told him I thought it was
garbage.''
   Previously, in similar lawsuits across the country, judges have
dismissed cases after ruling that artistic messages are protected
by the First Amendment. But those cases did not involve alleged
subliminal messages, which are said to influence people not even
aware they heard them.
   Whitehead has ruled that freedom of speech protections would not
apply to subliminal messages. He said he was not convinced the
hidden messages actually exist on the album but left the argument
to attorneys.
   The lawsuit is proceeding as a products liability case, with the
band and record company accused of negligence and reckless conduct.
The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages.
   Two days before Christmas 1985, Belknap, 18, held a sawed-off
shotgun to his chin and died instantly from a single blast. Vance,
20, blew away the lower portion of his face. He died three years
later of complications from his injuries and a reaction to
medication.
   Ken McKenna, the Belknaps' attorney, said Vance and Belknap were
chanting ``do it, do it'' before heading for the church playground
where the shooting took place and that Vance again chanted it
moments before he pulled the trigger.
   The defense contends the young men shot themselves because they
were deeply troubled and that alcohol and drug abuse contributed to
their suicide pact.
   ```Do it' is not a suicide message,'' Ms. Fulstone said. ``
`Better By You, Better Than Me' is not a suicide song. There are no
suicide songs on this album.''
   She said that the two young men did not have time to listen to
the album repeatedly as claimed and that Belknap initiated the
shooting because he was depressed over losing his job.
   Judas Priest lead singer Rob Halford was in court and later told
reporters the allegations were ``completely false and untrue.''
   He said he and other band members were disturbed by the deaths
but could not be held responsible.

<HEAD>No Charges To Be Filed Against Earth First! Activists, Lawyer Says</HEAD>

   Prosecutors will not file charges against
two Earth First! activists arrested in connection with a pipe bomb
explosion that injured them two months ago, a defense lawyer said
today.
   Douglas Horngrad, a lawyer for Darryl Cherney, said Alameda
County Deputy District Attorney Chris Carpenter told him in a
telephone conversation that no charges would be filed against
either Cherney or Judi Bari.
   ``I can't speak for the prosecutors, but we view their action as
confirmation of Judi and Darryl's innocence,'' Horngrad said. ``We
believe the Oakland Police Department never had the evidence
against them.''
   A spokeswoman for Carpenter said the prosecutor would not
comment until later today.
   Bari and Cherney have contended that the car bomb explosion May
24 in Oakland was in retaliation for their work in organizing
``Redwood Summer'' protests against the lumber industry.
   Authorities had suggested that, to the contrary, it had been
their own bomb that accidentally went off while they were driving,
and Cherney and Bari were initially arrested for investigation of
explosives possession.
   ``From the moment the bomb went off under Judi's seat, the
Oakland Police Department launched an investigation directed at
them solely because they are political activists,'' according to a
joint statement issued by Horngrad and Susan Jordan, a lawyer
representing Bari.
   ``The Oakland Police Department has conducted an unprecedented
and outrageous smear campaign in an attempt to discredit Earth
First! and Redwood Summer,'' the statement said.
   Bari, who suffered a broken pelvis in the explosion, was
released from Oakland's Highland hospital last week but is
receiving medical treatment at an undisclosed ``medical facility,''
a hospital spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   Horngrad said he has not been able to reach Cherney with the
news.
   ``I hope he's heard the news. He should be gratified but not
relieved because the person who put the bomb in the car is still at
large,'' Horngrad said.
   Authorities have not publicly identified any other suspects.
   Mike Roselle, a founder of the environmental group, said he
understood the prosecution decided against filing charges because
nails used to construct the homemade bomb did not match those found
in Bari's house.
   ``He did not say that was the only reason,'' Roselle said.

<HEAD>Ethics Panel Counsel Emphasizes Statements of Durenberger
Associates</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A confidential report on Sen. Dave
Durenberger, submitted to the Ethics Committee by its special
counsel, gives substantial weight to statements by his close
associates in concluding he should be denounced for financial
misconduct.
   Key documents highlighted in the report by Robert S. Bennett
were described to The Associated Press by sources who had read it.
The sources commented only on condition of anonymity.
   The report is expected to figure prominently in the six-member
committee's deliberations on Durenberger, R-Minn.
   ``We're meeting Wednesday _ stay tuned,'' committee Vice
Chairman Warren B. Rudman, R-N.H., said Tuesday.
   Durenberger, commenting meanwhile on WCCO radio in Minneapolis,
said the committee ``ought to do what I've done ... acknowledge
that I've done wrong and they ought to characterize it for people
so that it can guide others' conduct in the future.''
   Bennett's report supports an oral presentation he gave the
committee last month, when he said Durenberger had broken Senate
rules and should be denounced.
   If the committee finds that Durenberger broke Senate rules or
federal law, it could rebuke him in a letter or recommend that the
full Senate do so in a formal vote.
   Such a move by the Senate would have no surface effect on his
duties, but could generate severe political damage back home. The
Ethics Committee also could recommend to Durenberger's Republican
colleagues in the Senate that they strip him of ``seniority or
positions of responsibility'' such as key committee assignments.
   According to those who have seen the lengthy report, key
statements cited by Bennett include those of: Charles Kahn III,
Durenberger's legislative assistant for health policy; Anne Kelly
Planning, the former personal secretary and scheduler; Michael C.
Mahoney, his personal attorney, and Paul Overgaard, his onetime
campaign manager.
   Bennett also focused on statements from a Tobacco Institute
representative _ former Republican Sen. Marlow Cook of Kentucky _
and other trade association representatives who invited Durenberger
to speak for a fee, according to the sources.
   The investigation centers on allegations that Durenberger
violated Senate rules and federal law by disguising regular fee
speeches as promotions for his two books, accepting free limousine
rides in excess of gift limits, accepting reimbursements for
staying in a Minneapolis condominium that he partly owned and later
arranging a bogus sale of the condo unit.
   Durenberger has acknowledged breaking some rules but said he
never intended to do so and asked that any punishment be light.
   Ms. Planning, the former secretary and scheduler, said she did
not recall any group inviting the senator to give a book promotion
speech.
   She said she placed all speaking invitations into the same
folder and the senator would ``indicate whether the speech was to
be treated as an honorarium speech or a Piranha Press speech.''
Piranha Press published Durenberger's books.
   Bennett also cited an affidavit from Cook, who as a Tobacco
Institute representative invited Durenberger to one of the first
appearances after the book promotion deal became operational.
   ``There was no discussion of the senator's books or publisher
during the conversation,'' Cook said, adding that Durenberger never
mentioned or displayed the books during the address.
   Bennett mentioned Kahn, the former health policy aide, for
saying he didn't ``recall any group inviting the senator to promote
his books'' and was ``not aware of the criteria used to
differentiate'' between a book promotion and a speech for honoraria.
   Honoraria speeches are subject to the limits that Durenberger is
accused of exceeding. Legitimate book-promotion appearances would
be exempt.
   In several appearances before health care groups, Kahn told the
committee, Durenberger had to acknowledge he hadn't even completed
the health care book he was supposed to be promoting. He told the
organizations that his earlier book on defense policy was for sale.
   In concluding that Durenberger deceived the Senate to protect
his condominium reimbursements, Bennett cited statements by
Mahoney, acting as the senator's attorney; by Overgaard, whose
company bought the condominium; and Durenberger's own writings.
   Bennett noted that Mahoney told the committee he cautioned
Durenberger in 1986 that he ``couldn't find any support'' for
reimbursements the lawmaker had been receiving from the Senate
since 1983. Durenberger at the time owned the condominium with a
friend.
   Bennett also noted that in July 1987, Durenberger himself
confided to two friends in a letter than he believed he had relied
on ``shaky or misleading'' legal advice in establishing the
condominium arrangement.
   Bennett cited statements by Overgaard to conclude that the 1987
sale of the condominium was a sham concocted to let the payments
continue. Overgaard said the sale became effective in April 1987
through an oral agreement between himself and the senator.
   But Bennett included documents showing the legal papers
completing the deal weren't signed for another 2{ years.
   One document showed that Overgaard was so frustrated with
Durenberger's delays in sending him the papers to finalize the deal
that he threatened to pull out of the sale.
   In a September 1989 letter to the senator, Overgaard wrote,
``The last thing I need is to get involved in your ethics
investigation and be accused of participating in a sham transaction
by which you collect per diem ... on a residence you actually own.''

<HEAD>Many Soviets Unaware Gorbachev Agreed to Germany in NATO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet media left many citizens in the dark
Tuesday about President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's agreement to allow a
united Germany to join NATO.
   Muscovites interviewed in a city park who were aware of the
development said they approved, but admitted to doubts about the
nation they fought during World War II.
   ``It's good for stabilizing the situation in Europe,'' said a
72-year-old retired engineer. ``But on the other hand, if I am to
speak openly, I fought for five years, and I fear the Germans.''
   Despite a recent press law banning censorship, most newspapers
limited their coverage to a sketchy report by the official Tass
news agency.
   Tass reported that West Germany had agreed that troops would be
cut following the reunification of East Germany and West Germany,
but did not mention Gorbachev's reversal on the thorny issue of a
unified Germany's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   The government newspaper Izvestia published the bare-bones Tass
report. But it also printed an article by its own Berlin
correspondent titled: ``The route to unification is open.''
   The dispatch quoted West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl as saying
the Soviet Union had given the long-awaited green light for a
united Germany's membership in NATO.
   The joint news conference at which Kohl announced the
breakthrough was televised live. But subsequent television reports
about the Monday meeting between Gorbachev and Kohl were no more
informative than most of Tuesday's newspapers.
   State television broadcast an interview with Kohl and Gorbachev
offering optimistic comments just before their final session. Both
were comfortably clad in sweaters _ unusual informality for
Gorbachev.
   The lengthy report then showed the two leaders walking in a
mountain meadow, driving to a news conference, and saying goodbye
at the airport. The announcer said results of their negotiations
were revealed at the news conference, which had been broadcast live
earlier.
   But the announcer left those who had not seen the conference
guessing about what had happened.
   ``I heard only that they met, and then went for a walk,'' said a
23-year-old woman, enjoying the sunshine between rainstorms Tuesday
afternoon. ``But what they said on the walk _ it's not known to
anybody.''
   Radio Moscow's English broadcast did say: ``The united Germany
will be able to decide what blocs or alliances it wants to belong
to,'' and admitted that it would likely be NATO.
   The emphasis in all Soviet media was on sections of the
agreement that promise a reduction in German troops, and a future
non-aggression pact between NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
military alliance.
   A commentary Tuesday by Tass, signed by Alexander Antsiferov,
noted the Soviet change of heart and said it came only after NATO
and the Warsaw Pact took steps away from confrontation. Last week,
NATO issued a declaration that it was ready to sign a
non-aggression pact and no longer regarded the Soviet Union as an
adversary.
   The change also came just a few days after Gorbachev defeated
Communist Party hard-liners, who had accused him of undermining the
country's security by relaxing controls on Eastern Europe.
   At a party congress, which ended last week, Gorbachev succeeded
in replacing nearly the entire party leadership.
   Some Muscovites expressed doubts about a reunited Germany.
   Twenty million Soviets died in World War II, according to
official Soviet counts. The war, in which the Red Army repelled a
German invasion that brought Nazi troops hundreds of miles inside
the Soviet Union, is known in the Soviet Union as the Great
Patriotic War.
   ``Although the leaders of modern Germany are not aggressive _
well, today it's fine, but tomorrow a second Hitler could appear,
and it could start again,'' said the 72-year-old engineer, who
refused to give his name.
   For a 77-year-old Moscow woman who still has the letters her
husband wrote to her before disapearing on a World War II
battlefield, the thought of German membership in NATO is
``terrifying.''
   But still, she did not object.
   ``I think that a war will not happen. We'll trade and we'll help
each other,'' she said. ``I hope everything will be all right.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rejects Sharon's Plan to House Soviet Jews</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned
Housing Minister Ariel Sharon's use of emergency regulations to
speed up construction of housing for thousands of Soviet immigrants.
   Sharon was also dealt another blow as Tourism Minister Gideon
Patt opposed a second crash program for the immigrants, under which
the Soviet Jews would live temporarily in hotels and youth hostels.
   The three-judge Supreme Court panel ruled Sharon could have
sought approval from the parliament, or Knesset, instead of using
emergency powers.
   Tent camps are springing up across the country as a protest by
Israelis who say subsidies for immigrants are driving up rents and
pricing others out of the housing market.
   More than 63,000 Soviet Jews have arrived since 1989, and the
total this year is expected to reach 150,000.
   Sharon, who is also Cabinet coordinator for immigration, led the
government to approve emergency regulations July 1 that allow the
purchase and establishment of 3,000 prefabricated units in Israel.
   Some politicians criticized the move, saying Sharon might take
undemocratic steps and assume powers delegated to planning councils
and zoning boards. Sharon was accused as defense minister in 1982
of concealing military plans from the government during the army's
invasion of Lebanon.
   The Supreme Court decision followed an appeal by a liberal
legislator, Abraham Poraz of the Shinui Party.
   Poraz argued that Sharon used emergency regulations at a time
when the Knesset was debating the housing crisis. Last week, it
passed a law shortening housing license procedures.
   ``Emergency regulations are an anti-democratic act ... that
should be used only in difficult, exceptional situations, when
there is no other choice,'' Poraz said on Israel army radio.
   The Housing Ministry said in a short statement it will respect
the court's decision.
   It was the first time the court challenged the government's use
of emergency powers, which date from Israel's 1948 war for
independence. The procedure was introduced because there was fear
that the Knesset could not always be convened because of the
fighting.
   ``There is no doubt that this is a revolutionary decision,''
said Moshe Negbi, a legal expert for the Hebrew daily newspaper
Hadashot. ``For the first time, the Supreme Court clearly says that
the government ... must not use these radical powers when there is
no problem in convening the parliament.''
   ``The importance of this decision is that is again stresses the
superiority of the Knesset over the government,'' Negbi said.
   The government argued that emergency regulations were needed to
ease the housing crisis, and stated Israel's 20,000 available
rental apartments will be filled by the end of September.
   Sharon's other emergency plan was approved Sunday by the
government's ministerial immigration committee headed by him. That
plan would direct Soviet immigrants to low-rate hotels and youth
hostels, where they would rent rooms but would not get the
customary hotel service.
   But Patt told reporters Tuesday that the plan, devised without
prior consultations with the Tourism Ministry, was ``doomed to
fail.''
   He said the program would get Sharon ``a few rooms here and
there,'' perhaps 400 to 500.
   The government says it needs 7,000 to 8,000 units each month to
house the immigrants.

   Authorities set off a blast today in a house
where a powerful explosive was found, saying the substance was too
dangerous to move. The house was described as heavily damaged but
no surrounding buildings were affected.
   At least 2,000 people had been evacuated from the area after an
undetermined amount of nitroglycerin was found in a home Monday.
There were no injuries.
   ``There was definitely nitroglycerin exploded in the basement,''
said FBI spokesman Ed Boldt. ``The house, even though it doesn't
look like it (from the outside), has been pretty heavily damaged.
Apparently there wasn't as much nitro as we feared there might be.''
   Tests had indicated that a shot glass and syringe found in the
basement of the one-story frame house Monday contained
nitroglycerin, a flammable oil used in medicine and explosives,
said police Chief Donald White. Authorities had feared larger
containers nearby might contain the same substance.
   Authorities charged a man who had lived in the house until
recently.
   Before the chemical was set off with a time-delay blast, the
containers were surrounded by sandbags, windows in the house were
opened, and surrounding homes were boarded up, authorities said.
   The blast was set off shortly after 1:30 p.m.; within a
half-hour, evacuees began returning home.
   Boldt said it was the first time he knew of in his 11 years with
the FBI that authorities resorted to exploding a home.
   Officials decided not to try to move the materials because they
considered that even more dangerous, he said. They had considered
taking the containers to a gravel pit.
   Authorities found the liquid Monday while responding to a report
of a domestic dispute in this city of 20,000 about 30 miles north
of Dayton. Residents in a 12-block area around the home and along
the three-mile route to the gravel pit were urged to leave their
homes.
   Before exploding the substance today, authorities extended the
evacuation area by two blocks as a further precaution. Before that
decision, city spokesman Michael Hemm had estimated that 2,000
people were out of their homes.
   Oakley Gover and his wife left their home after police told them
there was danger of an explosion.
   ``We took them at their word, grabbed our dog and left,'' Gover
said.
   Steve Jackson of the American Red Cross' Miami Valley chapter
said about 12 people stayed overnight at an elementary school.
   Workers boarded up homes in the immediate area, shut off utility
service and marked the ground where natural-gas lines were buried.
   According to Hemm and White, Dana Taylor, 25, was charged with
possessing dangerous ordnance and was being held in the Miami
County Jail in Troy.
   ``We do know that the ingredients to make nitro are there,''
White said. ``(And) we know from other sources that he (Taylor) has
been setting off explosives in town or in the area.''
   White said Taylor had maintained that there were no explosives
in the house and that he knew little or nothing about explosives.
But Hemm said police have received information that Taylor has
experimented with explosives in the past.
   White declined to say what triggered the domestic dispute, only
that Taylor and his wife had been involved in an argument. He said
Taylor had recently moved out of the house.

   Raymond Dunn Jr. turned 16 Tuesday, but
the profoundly retarded birthday boy feasted not on cake, to which
he is allergic, but on the day's greatest gift: the bland, brown
infant formula that keeps him alive.
   Gerber Products Co., which stopped making the meat-based formula
in 1985, resumed production two months ago after Raymond's doctors
said he would die without it. Gerber employees volunteered to make
a batch on their own time, and on June 26 the Dunns received a
two-year supply, free of charge.
   ``Gerber says `Babies are our business,' but Raymond's their
business, too,'' said Carol Dunn, who spent five years trying to
get the company to retool for a market of one.
   The Dunns celebrate Raymond's birthdays quietly yet thankfully,
because each is one more than they were told to expect after
Raymond was born with a broken skull and a brain that had been
deprived of oxygen.
   At 16, Raymond is getting mail from Navy recruiters and college
admissions offices, but he rarely leaves his house in this village
in the Catskills.
   As he sits in his wheelchair or lies on his special floor mat,
Raymond moves only with the help of others, and sees only shadows.
His expression ranges from a painful grimace to a slight smile. He
snorts, gurgles, wheezes and occasionally burps.
   He weighs 32 pounds, and his twisted, cramped body is 4 feet
long. He suffers 15 to 20 major seizures a day and sleeps two or
three hours a night, if at all. His asthma makes each breath a
struggle; phlegm plugs repeatedly hospitalize him and threaten to
kill him.
   Raymond, the Dunns' only child, also is allergic to the foods
that help most children grow. But he always was sustained by
Gerber's MBF (meat-based formula).
   When Gerber decided to drop the product five years ago, Mrs.
Dunn was unable to find or create any substitute that did not make
Raymond sick. Frantic, she hunted down every can she could find,
and Gerber kept passing along its own backlog.
   By July 1988, Gerber ran out of MBF, leaving Raymond with less
than two years' supply.
   Supported by the state Association for Retarded Children, Mrs.
Dunn begged Gerber to make more MBF, and began a mail campaign
asking others to pressure the company. Finally, the company's
research director gave in.
   Since the nation learned of how a mother's devotion moved a
large corporation, Mrs. Dunn and her husband, Raymond Sr., a car
salesman, have received a shopping bag full of mail. A Sunday
school class sent a check for $28. A dealer in rare baseball cards
offered Raymond any card he wanted. The Rev. Raymond Dunn, no
relation, told Mrs. Dunn that when her son finally dies, ``You will
have a saint in heaven.''
   Meanwhile, at Gerber, volunteers in the research division put
their own projects on hold, hauled out old equipment and devoted
several thousand square feet and several days of production space
and time to Raymond's supply of MBF.
   It arrived in Yankee Lake just in time. The Dunns had about two
dozen cans of the old formula, enough to last through the end of
July.
   Each July 17, Mrs. Dunn worries that this birthday will be
Raymond's last, so she follows the same ritual.
   She takes last year's birthday number candles from the tea cup
over the sink and burns them down. Then she takes the candle
numbers from this year's cake and places them in the cup, where
they sit for the next 12 months. Raymond wears the same gold
cardboard king's crown, with each year marked on a point on the
crown.
   But even these rituals are touched by sadness. There are only
two points left on the crown, and Mrs. Dunn has not had to let it
out in many years because Raymond's head grows very little.
   What is most remarkable about Raymond is not his condition, but
the care he receives. His mother and a platoon of teachers and
helpers caress him almost constantly. They feed him seven times
daily, and brush his teeth after each feeding.
   Raymond sleeps in his parents' bed, often between them. He
receives about a dozen different medications, some several times a
day. His mother's calendar has no luncheon dates or hairdresser's
appointments; it is devoted entirely to charting the times and
dosages of just one asthma remedy.
   But the Dunns say his birthday reminds them that life at its
most marginal, at its most precarious, is life at its most
meaningful.
   When Raymond was an infant they were urged to institutionalize
him, told that keeping him home would burn them out and ruin their
marriage.
   ``We knew we'd have to pay a price, and the price has been
hard,'' Mrs. Dunn says. ``I've given up a normal life. But Raymond
gives me a lot of joy. Does it outweigh the sorrow? No. But he is
my son, and if I had put Raymond away, the price would have been
even higher.''

   In a memorable episode of the British TV sitcom
``Fawlty Towers,'' a bumbling hotel owner goes to absurd lengths
``not to mention the war'' to his German guests, then proceeds to
do just that _ over and over.
   That episode from the 1970s, which had actor John Cleese
goose-stepping and heil-Hitlering in hilarious fashion, is being
recalled these days as British commentators wrestle anew with the
complexities of Anglo-German relations.
   First there was Nicholas Ridley, trade secretary and close
confidant of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, sounding off last
week about ``uppity'' Germans trying to take over Europe.
   Then came publication Sunday of the summary of a secret seminar
hosted by Mrs. Thatcher, in which leading academics put Germany on
the psychiatrist's couch, analyzing such stereotypical traits as
bullying, angst and sentimentality.
   Ridley resigned, and Mrs. Thatcher's office vowed to find out
who leaked the summary to the press. But as most observers agreed,
the two episodes served to bring a delicate issue into the open.
   The issue is the mix of suspicion, envy and scholarly
fascination that characterizes Britain's attitude to Germany,
steeped in memories of World War II.
   Today, whatever hostility remains is usually expressed in jokes,
about early-rising German holidaymakers grabbing the best beaches,
or Basil Fawlty screaming at his staff: ``Whatever you do, don't
mention the war!''
   But lately, things have gotten serious. Germany is a formidable
economic power, and after it reunites, the deutschmark looks
certain to dominate the European Community.
   Thus, argue supporters of Ridley and Mrs. Thatcher, surely a
small island nation like Britain with chronic economic problems has
the right to ask what sort of Europe it is going into.
   The trouble, as in Fawlty's case, is in the presentation.
   Ridley expressed a genuine popular concern which is shared by
Mrs. Thatcher. But his references to the EC bureaucracy as Hitler,
and to Britain ``being bossed by a German,'' were widely criticized.
   The seminar was a free-ranging session covering many opinions.
According to participants, it only looked controversial when it was
boiled down to a 2,000-word summary by Mrs. Thatcher's private
secretary for foreign affairs, Charles Powell.
   ``If Chancellor Kohl himself had sat in on that meeting, he
would have agreed with, or at least accepted as fair comment, 90
percent of what was said,'' Timothy Garton Ash, a German affairs
scholar who attended the seminar, wrote in The Independent.
   Opposition Labor Party lawmakers accused Powell of slanting the
summary to match Mrs. Thatcher, and got no straight answer when
they asked her whether she repudiated Ridley's remarks.
   Some German commentators find the uproar symptomatic of a
British identity crisis, rooted in memories of its lost empire and
World War II, when it stood alone but united against Hitler.
   In The Independent on Sunday, Neal Ascherson noted a German
tendency to regard Britain as a twilight world on the fringes of
Europe, ``a raft being pulled away into the sunset by a mad queen
whose shouts grow gradually fainter.''
   He said that when he lived in Germany 20 years ago, attacks like
Ridley's would have provoked ``panic-stricken self-questioning
about why the `ugly Germans' were still so ugly. Now they are just
laughing at us.''
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd was also critical of his
nation's tendency ``just to draw down the blinds, shut out the real
world, swear at the present world and pretend that we can go on
just living in the past.''
   He pointed out that Germany had prospered by working hard,
producing manufactured goods, holding down inflation _ ``all the
things we failed to do.''
   Garton Ash blamed history and geography.
   ``America,'' he wrote, ``is far enough away, and still big and
powerful enough, to be quite relaxed about the re-emergence of
Germany as a great power in central Europe. France (let alone
Poland) is too small and too relatively weak to be anything but
deadly serious about it.
   ``But Britain is somewhere in between: close enough to be
worried and weak enough to be resentful (`Who won the war,
anyway?'), yet also far enough away, and still self-confident
enough, to be outspoken and outrageous.''

<HEAD>DEA Says Traffickers Finding Cocaine in Short Supply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug traffickers are finding cocaine in short
supply nearly everywhere in the United States, a top U.S. drug
official said Tuesday.
   Ronald Caffrey told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the
shortage was the ``first positive development in domestic wholesale
cocaine availability and prices since the onset of the cocaine
epidemic.''
   Caffrey, the Drug Enforcement Administration's deputy assistant
administrator for operations, said cocaine prices had reached their
highest level since mid-1985 and that purity levels had dropped.
   The combination of high prices and low purity generally
indicates a shortage in the drug, he said.
   Some of the shortages, Caffrey said, may be due to stockpiling
by cocaine traffickers and price gouging by those playing on fears
of a shortage.
   He said law enforcement efforts at home and in Latin America
have had a major impact on the drug's availability, but
acknowledged that it could be temporary.
   One way the DEA knew shortages existed was because of its
undercover agents' dealings with drug traffickers.
   ``Normally, when we do our undercover work, we go out and we buy
drugs at certain prices that are quoted to us,'' Caffrey said.
``When the market starts to dry up a little bit, suddenly people
are asking us to sell them drugs, and then sting operations occur.''
   Caffrey said wholesale price increased in Los Angeles, New York
City, Houston, Chicago and Miami between December and June. In New
York, for example, prices ranged from $14,000 to $20,000 per kilo
in December but increased to $21,000 to $35,000 per kilo by June.
   However, Caffrey said prices remain far below the $55,000 to
$65,000 price per kilo in 1982.
   At the same time, the level of cocaine purity has dropped
steadily since 1988, he said.
   The agency found that purity at the kilo level decreased from 90
percent two years ago to 74 percent in June. At the gram, or
street-buy level, purity dropped from 70 percent two years ago to
55 percent last month, the DEA said.
   Asked outside the hearing about the results of an unreleased
cocaine price and purity survey of all 19 DEA field offices,
Caffrey said the trend toward increased prices and decreased purity
of wholesale quantities of cocaine was ``almost nationwide.''
   ``Florida is a little bit different in the sense that, yeah,
prices have gone up since last year at this time, but I would say
that it is still fairly stable,'' he said.
   That, he said, ``would indicate to us that at least in Florida,
there is a fair amount of wholesale cocaine available.''
   Until Tuesday, the DEA had been unwilling to say there was a
shortage in wholesale level cocaine in most of the United States
despite information on price and purity changes. National drug
policy director William J. Bennett had hailed those changes as
indications of a shortage.

<HEAD>Nurse Says She Was Innocent, Journalist Was Not A Spy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELINDA HAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British nurse on her first full day of
freedom from an Iraqi jail professed her innocence Tuesday and said
she did not believe executed journalist Farzad Bazoft was a spy.
   Daphne Parish, 53, acknowledged that she drove Bazoft to the
site of an explosion near an Iraqi military installation and saw no
wrong in their action.
   ``It didn't appear improper at the time. We didn't do anything I
considered illegal,'' she told reporters in the Zambian capital,
Lusaka.
   Earlier Tuesday, President Kenneth Kaunda handed Mrs. Parish
over to British officials in Lusaka.
   Kaunda, who secured Mrs. Parish's release on humanitarian
grounds, said he blamed British press coverage of events in Iraq
and official British hostility toward Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein for Bazoft's death.
   He said an appeal sent by him before Bazoft's execution on May
15 also sought the Iranian-born reporter's release.
   If it were not for what he described as Britain's vicious
attitude to Iraq ``that man might have lived, might have been here
with Daphne,'' he said.
   The British Foreign Office declined to comment on Kaunda's
remarks.
   In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sent personal
messages of thanks to Kaunda and Saddam, her office said Tuesday.
   Bazoft, who traveled on British documents but did not have
British nationality, was on assignment for the London Sunday
newspaper, The Observer, at the time of his arrest.
   His colleagues have insisted he was not a spy but merely an
enthusiastic reporter.
   Speaking with reporters at the Lusaka home of British High
Commissioner Peter Henchcliffe, Mrs. Parish said she drove Bazoft
to the Al-Iskandaria military complex on her day off. Other British
journalists had already visited the complex and some climbed over a
perimeter fence.
   ``We didn't climb over any fences,'' she said. ``As we were
driving around, we saw what appeared like coal dust on the side of
the road.''
   Bazoft wanted to collect some of the dust and Mrs. Parish said
she gave him a bottle to put it in.
   ``We did this in full view of cars going up and down. We did
nothing secretly. It was all out in the open.''
   Iraq has denied using chemical weapons, and it accused Bazoft of
collecting soil samples to establish the nature of weapons housed
at the military base.
   Mrs. Parish, sentenced to 15 years in jail as an accomplice of
Bazoft, said she was told of her release by guards at Abu Ghraud
prison mid-morning Monday and thought it was a joke.
   ``I just laughed,'' she said.
   She was jailed last September and convicted in March.
   Mrs. Parish said she kept physically trim in jail by doing
aerobics. In a cell with four other women, she also kept her mind
occupied by making playing cards and chess, with pieces out of old
newspaper.
   Mrs. Parish planned to leave Zambia on a scheduled British
Airways flight to London late Tuesday, accompanied by a
Lusaka-based British diplomat.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Up Despite Boost in U.S. Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit widened to $7.73
billion in May as a big jump in imports of oil and foreign cars
offset the second-highest level of exports on record, the Commerce
Department reported Tuesday.
   The May deficit was 5.8 percent higher than a revised April
trade gap of $7.31 billion, but most economists discounted the
report as a small worsening of the deficit.
   They pointed out U.S. export sales remained strong and they
predicted the trend would continue as economic growth overseas
helps prop up a sluggish American market.
   ``Thank goodness for trade. It remains the brightest spot in the
economy,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
``The small increase in the May deficit is not of concern because
we believe that strong growth overseas will keep U.S. exports
rising.''
   Many analysts believe export sales are the only thing keeping
the country out of a recession. In the first three months of the
year, fully half of total economic growth was supplied by the rise
in overseas sales.
   In a separate report Tuesday, the Federal Reserve said
industrial output rose by 0.4 percent in June, helping push the
operating rate at the nation's factories, mines and utilities to
83.5 percent of capacity, the highest level this year.
   Much of the June increase reflected a spurt in auto production
in advance of a possible strike this fall and a heat wave which
boosted utility demand. But analysts said a growing portion of U.S.
manufacturing output is being shipped to overseas markets.
   The Bush administration, which is counting on strong foreign
demand to continue propping up the economy, was pleased with the
May trade report.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher noted the U.S. trade deficit
for the first five months of the year was almost $6 billion less
than the same period a year ago.
   ``We can be encouraged by our continuing steady export growth of
8 percent this year, which is more than double the overall growth
of imports,'' Mosbacher said.
   However, Lawrence Chimerine, a senior economic adviser at
DRI-McGraw Hill Inc., said import demand has been depressed by the
sluggish U.S. economy. He said once the economy picks up, the trade
deficit would resume climbing, especially given America's growing
dependence on foreign oil.
   So far this year, the merchandise trade deficit has been running
at an annual rate of $97.68 billion, surprising many analysts who
had predicted little change from the 1989 deficit of $109.4 billion.
   Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, said that
deficit for all of 1990 should end up between $90 billion and $95
billion, marking the first time since 1983 the country has had a
deficit below $100 billion.
   For May, imports climbed by 2.9 percent to $40.52 billion
offsetting a 2.3 percent rise in U.S. exports, which totaled $32.79
billion. The trade deficit is the difference between imports and
exports.
   The export level, second highest in history after a March figure
of $33.3 billion, was bolstered by gains in various areas including
automotive parts, capital goods and consumer products.
   Close to half of the total import increase came from a 15.2
percent increase in oil shipments during May. America's foreign oil
bill totaled $4.32 billion during the month as the volume rose to
8.95 million barrels a day, up from 7.55 million barrels daily in
April. The price per barrel dropped by $1 to $15.57 in May.
   Analysts said that with domestic oil production dropping to its
lowest level in more than a quarter of a century, the dependence on
foreign oil is certain to rise even higher in coming months.
   Much of the rest of the increase in imports in May came from a
10 percent jump in shipments of foreign motor vehicles and parts,
which climbed to $6.22 billion.
   The United States continued to enjoy a trade surplus with the
countries of Western Europe of $812 million in May.
   The biggest deficit was, as usual, with Japan _ a $2.97 billion
imbalance, down from an April gap of $3.95 billion.

<HEAD>Two Top Economic Advisers Resign, Giving Way to Proponents of
`Shock' Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW SCOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of President-elect Alberto Fujimori's top
economic advisers have resigned, raising speculation the new
government is planning an economic ``shock'' program to fix Peru's
battered economy.
   Fujimori vigorously denied he would create such a program during
his campaign, but the resignations Monday of Adolfo Figueroa and
Santiago Roca leave Fujimori's advisers dominated by proponents of
a ``shock'' plan.
   Fujimori has been meeting in private for the last week with the
advisers to iron out policies and form a Cabinet. They have been
meeting at a military base in Lima for security reasons and have
not disclosed details of their meetings.
   In a joint resignation letter, Roca and Figueroa said they
wanted to allow Fujimori ``complete freedom to make the appropriate
decisions for the country's best interests.''
   Political analyst Manuel D`Ornellas, writing in newspaper
Expreso on Tuesday, said: ``Fujimori no longer has internal
opposition to his adjustment program. But outside he'll face a
mountain of it.''
   Fujimori's opponent in the election, novelist Mario Vargas
Llosa, bluntly proposed the need for drastic changes to revive
Peru's economy, burdened by 3,000 percent annual inflation and high
unemployment.
   Analysts and pollsters said much of Fujimori's support came from
poorer people who feared Vargas Llosa's austerity plans. Many now
attack Fujimori for abandoning his supporters by adopting some of
Vargas Llosa's ideas.
   Since his election June 10, Fujimori has emphasized his desire
to re-establish relations with international lending agencies such
as the International Monetary Fund.
   The IMF and other lending organizations cut off credit to Peru
after President Alan Garcia stopped foreign debt repayments in 1986.
   In late June, Fujimori met in New York with leaders of the IMF,
the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. He
expressed his willingness to cooperate on economic policies to
secure new loans to help Peru cope with its $20 billion foreign
debt.
   Many interpreted that as his acceptance of the need for more
serious measures to stop inflation and promote growth.
   Since his trip, in which he also visited Japan, his ancestral
homeland, Fujimori has said he will dismantle price subsidy
programs and exchange rate controls.
   Many blame the weak economy on Garcia's populist programs of
deficit spending and price controls on basic goods and services.
   Prices for water, electricity and telephone service are among
the lowest in the region. Gasoline costs the equivalent of 20 U.S.
cents for a gallon, less than what the government oil company pays
to produce it. Many state-owned companies are broke, and press
reports say the Central Bank is $129 million in the red.
   Roca and Figueroa were not the first to depart from Fujimori's
economic team over policy differences. Oscar Ugarteche, who served
on a commission studying the foreign debt problem, resigned because
of disagreements over debt policies and rejoining the IMF.
   Fujimori is scheduled to take office July 28, his 52nd birthday.

<HEAD>Senate Votes to Restrict Growth of Textile, Apparel Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate brushed aside veto threats by
President Bush and voted Tuesday to restrict the growth of U.S.
imports of textiles and apparel to 1 percent a year and freeze
imports of shoes at 1989 levels.
   By a potentially veto-overriding 68-32 vote, the Senate approved
a textile-import bill nearly identical to measures passed by
Congress in 1985 and 1988 but successfully vetoed by then-President
Reagan.
   ``They do not want to do anything for the textile industry,''
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said of the Bush administration. ``If we
do nothing, it is safe to predict the demise of the industry is at
hand.''
   Since 1980, the U.S. trade deficit on textiles and apparel has
jumped from $4.7 billion to $26.5 billion, making it the second
largest component of the nation's trade deficit behind oil.
   Over the same time, more than 1,800 textile and apparel plants
have closed and employment has dropped by 400,000 to just over 1.9
million jobs _ despite an $18 billion modernization effort.
   Opponents claimed the bill would cost consumers $25 billion to
$27 billion a year in higher prices.
   ``You do not notice it much,'' said Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.
``Just 50 cents a shirt here; a dollar, ... two dollars a pair of
shoes. But add that up by 250 million consumers in this country.
That is a lot of money.''
   Bush rejected a last-minute appeal Tuesday from senators from
textile-producing states to back off his threatened veto.
   ``I can't do that,'' he said. ``I can't say that I think the
answer to the problem of textiles is further protection.''
   The administration contended any further restrictions placed by
the United States on textile imports would ``virtually destroy any
chance of a successful conclusion'' by the end of this year to the
4-year-old Uruguay Round of 100-nation trade negotiations in Geneva.
   But lawmakers from textile-, apparel- and shoe-producing states
said they fear the administration will sacrifice textile concerns
in those talks to win concessions from trading partners on
protecting U.S. copyrights and patents and to secure a lowering of
those countries' barriers to American farm exports and service
suppliers.
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., said the major U.S. trading
partners have shown no willingness to yield on the major issues in
the Geneva negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT).
   ``We are about to lose our shirt,'' he predicted. ``They will
not yield on agriculture in Europe. They will not yield on
intellectual property rights and computers in South America.''
   The Senate's vote was well beyond the two-thirds needed to
override a veto and more lopsided than the 59-36 vote by which the
Senate approved nearly identical legislation a year ago.
   A similar bill in the House is being sponsored by 234 of its 435
members but faces some difficulty because of opposition from Rep.
Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee's subcommittee on trade.
   The bill would establish nation-by-nation quotas on U.S. imports
of textiles, apparel and non-rubber footwear beginning this year,
except for certain products from Canada and Israel, which have
free-trade agreements with the United States.
   Textile and apparel imports, which have tripled in the last
decade, would be allowed to grow only 1 percent a year while shoe
imports would be frozen at their 1989 level.
   However, to reduce opposition from farm interests who fear
retaliation, the bill would provide increases in quotas to
countries that increase their purchases of U.S. agricultural
products.
   Several attempts to weaken the bill through amendments were
defeated by better than 2-to-1 margins.

   Palestine Liberation Organization
guerrillas moved in Tuesday to block pro-Iranian fundamentalists'
attack on a rival faction in south Lebanon. Police said 52 people
were killed and 167 wounded.
   A police spokesman said Yasser Arafat's guerrillas intervened
after Hezbollah, or Party of God, overran the village of Jarjou
Monday night. That stripped the Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem Amal of
its main stronghold in Iqlim al-Tuffah, or the Apple Province.
   A police spokesman called it the bloodiest battle in six months
in the mountainous regions above Sidon, provincial capital of south
Lebanon. Jarjou is 10 miles southeast of Sidon.
   The spokesman, who could not be named in line with standing
regulations, said that in the final push that ended just before
midnight, 40 people were killed and 117 wounded. Twelve people were
killed and 50 wounded in clashes earlier in the day.
   ``It was close-quarter combat. The village square is littered
with bodies that couldn't be evacuated by the Red Cross because of
the savage fighting,'' the spokesman said.
   He said the fatalities included 30 Amal fighters and 10 from
Hezbollah.
   An estimated 600 PLO fighters entered Iqlim al-Tuffah at 4 a.m.
on orders from Arafat.
   Their deployment blocked Hezbollah's advance toward Nabatiyeh,
the main Shiite town in south Lebanon, some five miles south of
Jarjou.
   It also left the fundamentalists bottled up in a mountain
enclave with no access west to the Mediterrnean coast, or south
toward the major Shiite cities and towns.
   A Hezbollah official in Sidon, provincial capital of south
Lebanon, rejected what he described as Palestinian ``expansion,''
and vowed to ``confront it.''
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Palestinian move would lead to ``large-scale violence,'' but he
refused to say what Hezbollah planned to do about it.
   Zeid Wehbe, the PLO's representative in Lebanon, said Arafat
appealed to Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani to ``throw his
weight behind the PLO intervention to stop the intra-Shiite
bloodshed.''
   The PLO has about 5,000 hardcore fighters based in refugee camps
around Sidon.
   It fears Hezbollah might try to seize control of Sidon to gain
an outlet to the Mediterranean, a move that would dramatically
alter the strategic balance in the region north of Israel.
   Hezbollah needs a coastal outlet because its supply lines from
the Bekaa Valley northeast of the battle zone are vulnerable to
interdiction by Syria and its Lebanese allies.
   A PLO source said that if Hezbollah controlled ``any part of the
coast, they'll have a port to ship in weapons, ammunition and
fighters and establish their own Islamic republic modeled on Iran.
   ``This cannot be permitted. ... No one wants Iran to become a
key partner to the Middle East conflict,'' he explained.
   The source, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Palestinian deployment Tuesday was ``personally ordered by Arafat
in a message received overnight.''
   Shortly after the PLO move, Israeli warplanes made several
low-level passes over the battle zone. They repeatedly broke the
sound barrier, but did not open fire.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been fighting off and on for three years
for control of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest
sect.
   By police count, 1,069 people have been killed and 3,228 wounded
in the conflict.

   Thousands of rockers, rappers and producers from
as far away as the Soviet Union chased down record contracts at one
of the country's biggest music conventions, which graduated the
likes of Madonna and Run DMC.
   The 11th-annual New Music Seminar, drawing 8,000 people
worldwide this year, combines an exhibition hall of blasting
stereos hawking the wares, 85 panel discussions, and shows by more
than 300 bands.
   The first convention was held in a rehearsal studio with 200
participants in 1979. It caters mainly to performers looking for
their big break and to ``indies,'' independent record producers who
seek ``unsigned'' artists _ musicians without a record contract.
   ``We have an ideology that makes us fireproof in terms of
obsolescence, because the program brings together the neophyte and
insurgent elements,'' said Mark Jacobsen, 32, executive director of
New Music Seminar.
   During the five-day convention, which ends Wednesday, panel
discussions covered distribution, publishing, stage presence, video
production and social issues. Environmental attorney Robert Kennedy
Jr. and ex-Go Go Jane Wiedlin pushed Earth concerns. Singer Dionne
Warwick called for more AIDS education by the industry.
   Even separatist political movements were apparent at the
convention _ the Estonian delegation taped over the USSR on their
name tags.
   The convention was a hectic, surreal scene of rockers in leather
and tattoos and rappers in gold and chiseled haircuts talking
business in the luxurious glass, steel and marble halls of the
Marriott Marquis on Times Square. Their convention tags bore such
names as Bashun Beat, Freeze, Neutron, Coyote Shivers and Dave Rave.
   ``It's the one time you can talk to label executives and they'll
give you the time of day,'' said Robert Oss of Lunar Music in
Hamilton, Ontario. ``You also get a kind of beat on what's going
on.''
   Many carried briefcases and lined up at public phones to fill
orders or arrange other meetings.
   ``I need 200 more of each record; how soon can I get them?'' a
rocker-businessman in a T-shirt said over the phone.
   More than 100 booths filled the exhibition hall, with stereos
blasting rock and rap.
   Booths featured the latest talent from Germany, Italy,
Australia, Spain and France, music magazines, suppliers and social
groups like ``Ban the Box,'' which campaigns against the use of
oversize CD packaging, criticized as a waste of trees.
   One panel discussion Monday was led by the Earth Communications
Office, a Los Angeles-based group that urges entertainment
companies and artists to help get the public more aware of the
environment.
   Because young people more often look up to rock stars than
politicians, ``you have a major responsibility. If you don't use
it, we'll be living in a very different world,'' said Kennedy, who
sat on the panel.
   The convention reflected the intertwining of business and music.
   ``I do spend more time doing business than writing songs,'' said
Page Hamilton, lead singer of the avant-garde noise band Helmet.
``I'm busy doing album covers and promotion like advance cassettes,
press packets, photos, T-shirts.''
   Jody Kurilla, in charge of booking the convention's more than
300 acts, said she auditioned more than 10,000 tapes from around
the world. She said there was no single trend but various currents
of funk, rock, rap, world beat, industrial dance, Latin and the
hippy-psychedelic style from Manchester, England.
   Performers who played in previous years included Madonna, New
Order, Run DMC and the B-52s, organizers said.
   Record industry officials say they are unable to chart how big a
chunk the independents own of the $6.5 billion music industry.
   But an advantage of independent labels is they can sell 2,000 to
3,000 records or tapes and break even, while the larger companies
require sales in the tens of thousands, said Kramer, 31-year-old
owner of Shimmy-Disc Records in New York. He uses only one name.

   A jubilant Chancellor Helmut Kohl said
Tuesday that all major obstacles to German unification had been
swept aside and said elections for a united German parliament were
likely in December.
   Speaking to reporters the day after he returned from the Soviet
Union with guarantees that a united Germany was free to join NATO,
Kohl also said he hoped bilateral treaties with the Soviet Union
and Poland could be concluded by early next summer.
   ``The practical problems, which lay before us on the way to
German unity, have been solved,'' Kohl said.
   He said elections for a united German parliament on Dec. 2 were
``presumable.'' But whether East Germany merged with the West
before or after the elections had to be decided by East Berlin, he
added.
   The deputy chairman of the largest faction in the East German
Parliament said East Germany could vote to join West Germany under
its constitution on Dec. 1.
   Udo Kamm of the Christian Democratic coalition said his faction
would vote for such a proposal in a committee Thursday. The
proposal would then go to the full Parliament.
   In Washington, President Bush said Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's consent for a united Germany in NATO was ``very, very
significant and very important.'' Bush said the United States
deserves a lot of credit.
   ``I take pride in the way Europe is moving into this new era of
freedom,'' he said. ``It's a goal that we Americans have long
worked to achieve.''
   In a 40-minute telephone call to Gorbachev, Bush assured him
that NATO poses no threat to the Soviet Union and that the United
States is ready to move toward warmer relations, officials said.
   Kohl also tried Tuesday to reassure Germany's neighbors.
   ``We are no world power,'' he said, emphasizing that the new
Germany would be embedded in the ``European security architecture.''
   He said he was sensitive to the concerns of fellow Europeans. He
noted that Britain had gambled ``its very existence'' in battling
Hitler. He said it was no accident Germany had agreed to reduce the
size of a united army to 370,000 and cut compulsory military
service from 15 to 12 months.
   East German Foreign Minister Markus Meckel, however, rejected
the idea of one German army and said East Germany needed its own
military. Currently, the two Germanys have about 600,000 men under
arms, 480,000 of them in West Germany.
   In Paris, meanwhile, the nations negotiating German unification
reached a historic agreement, confirming Poland's border with East
Germany and clearing the way for one Germany by year's end.
   West Germany also agreed to hold economic assistance talks with
Poland later in the summer.
   Terms of the border settlement were not announced. Polish
Foreign Minister Krysztof Skubiszewski said they were confidential,
but all the foreign ministers stressed the border would be the line
between Poland and East Germany that was drawn at the end of the
war.
   ``We are very happy with the results,'' Skubiszewski said. ``The
border has been confirmed.''
   The border settlement should serve to allay Polish concerns that
a merged Germany would revive old claims on territory given to
Poland in partial compensation for a larger area taken over by the
Soviet Union.
   In evaluating the role of the new Germany in central Europe,
Kohl said he envisioned it as a ``transit point for ideas and
perspectives'' between West and East.
   The treaty with the Soviets, Kohl said, could include economic
aid. But he said no specific financial aid was offered during his
weekend visit to induce the Soviets to remove one of their biggest
obstacles to German unification _ objections to a united Germany in
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who accompanied Kohl
and Finance Minister Theo Waigel on the trip to Moscow, also said
West Gemany and the Soviet Union reached agreement on cooperation
without West Germany giving specific aid promises.
   ``We reached agreement ... on long-term cooperation, but we have
not discussed any numbers,'' Genscher said in Paris.
   Waigel said the Soviets presented ``no bill'' for their
acceptance of German reunification. But he said it was in the
German interest for the Soviet reform process to succeed.
   West Germany has already backed a $3 billion bank credit to help
the Soviet Union revamp its economy and has agreed to pay $780
million toward the upkeep of Soviet soldiers stationed in East
Germany in the second half of this year.
   At last week's Houston summit of Western industrial powers, Kohl
had pushed for a $15 billion international aid package for the
Soviet Union. Instead, the leaders asked the International Monetary
Fund to study what kind of aid would be most beneficial.
   Kohl ruled out the possibility that West Germany would be the
sole future source of financial aid to the Soviets, saying the
burden would be too great.
   However, he said he could envision West Germany helping the
Soviets retrain thousands of soldiers returning from East Germany,
who could face unemployment back home.
   It was also possible, he said, for West Germany to help in
supplying housing but ``not for a certain category of Soviet
residents.'' West German officials are concerned about the domestic
political fallout of building housing specifically for returning
Soviet troops.

   President Bush called Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev on Tuesday and said his consent for a united Germany in
NATO was ``very, very significant and very important.''
   Bush also said the United States deserves a lot of credit for
helping remove the last major obstacle to German unity.
   ``I take pride in the way Europe is moving into this new era of
freedom,'' the president said. ``It's a goal that we Americans have
long worked to achieve.''
   In a 40-minute telephone call to Gorbachev, Bush assured the
Soviet president that NATO poses no threat to Moscow and that the
United States is ready to move toward warmer relations, officials
said.
   Bush also briefed Gorbachev on last week's seven-nation economic
summit and the decision not to block any Western nation from
providing cash assistance to Moscow, said the officials, who
requested anonymity. Bush explained that the United States is
willing to provide technical help but not money.
   It was the fourth telephone call to Gorbachev by Bush in his 18
months in office.
   Separately, Bush also called West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and congratulated him on his talks with Gorbachev and the dropping
of Soviet objections to East Germany joining West Germany under the
umbrella of the Western alliance.
   Amid a glow of triumph in the West, Bush made a deliberate
effort to highlight his own role in promoting German unity.
   There was an apparent feeling in the White House that Monday's
announcement of a deal between Gorbachev and Kohl failed to give
proper credit to other Western leaders. ``When good things happen
as a result of the combined efforts of the allies, it makes sense
to take note of that,'' one administration official said, speaking
privately.
   Bush, addressing a gathering of magazine publishers, said the
Gorbachev-Kohl statements about a unified Germany were ``very, very
significant and very important and ... let me reflect on how we got
here.''
   He said, ``I remember telling the press last October, before the
Berlin Wall came down, that when we said we supported German unity
we really meant that and we meant it without qualifications.
   ``I know the German people have appreciated that stand by the
United States.''
   The president recalled that he had held separate meetings with
Kohl, French President Francois Mitterrand and British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher to forge a unified position, and then
discussed the subject at length with Gorbachev, particularly during
a meeting at Camp David on June 2.
   Bush noted that he had said, at a wrap-up news conference with
Gorbachev, that they had agreed that Germany should be free to
choose its own alliance. ``President Gorbachev, if you remember,
didn't challenge that, and I _ we all thought that that was a good
sign then.''
   Bush said, ``We also had to show him that the NATO alliance was
not his enemy but was a force for stability that could adapt, could
indeed change, adapt to the new realities in Europe.''
   On that point, Bush noted that it was the United States that
drafted the NATO-restructuring plan adopted at a summit of alliance
leaders in London July 6.
   Bush quoted Gorbachev as having said Monday that it would have
been difficult to make headway on Germany with the ``very important
impulse'' from NATO.
   Bush said that Gorbachev and Kohl ``have displayed, I think,
exceptional qualities of leadership during this challenging
period.''
   A senior White House official said Bush had no misgivings about
Kohl and Gorbachev striking a deal themselves without involving
other Western leaders.
   The official said, ``It's clear that the whole process of
diplomatic efforts _ of Mitterrand, Thatcher, Kohl and Bush visits
with Gorbachev _ then the NATO summit and then the economic summit
were a very strong and powerful impetus towards Gorbachev moving in
this direction.''
   ``Basically, everybody was in it together,'' he said.
   As for Kohl and Gorbachev announcing the breakthrough, he added,
``That's where it should have been. That's where the front line is.
That's where these two leaders have got to work out their
relationship.''

<HEAD>Soviet Novelist Valentin Pikul Dead at 62</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Popular historical novelist Valentin Pikul, whose
books focused on Russia's sweeping upheavals, has died, the Tass
news agency reported Tuesday. He was 62.
   The dispatch from Riga, which quoted the Union of Latvian
Writers, did not give the date or the cause of death.
   Pikul's novels often delved into topics that were long taboo,
such as the downfall of the Russian royalty and the influence of
the monk Grigory Rasputin over the family of Czar Nicholas II.
   In some of his historical novels, he was accused of being
anti-Semitic. In his 1979 novel, ``At the Final Frontier,'' he
tried to show that Rasputin was a tool of Zionists.
   Other literary critics accused him of a nonchalant attitude
toward historical facts.
   ``The novel is the form of self-expression that I love,'' he
once wrote. ``I love a novel with a multitude of characters and a
furious succession of events. I hate those feeble little novels in
which the author pokes around in the intimate psychology of
characters that are depressed and bored by life.''
   During the World War II German blockade of his native Leningrad,
Pikul was evacuated to Archangelsk, where he entered the navy and
served on the destroyer Groznyi. His first novel, ``Ocean Patrol,''
published in 1954, was about the Soviet fleet.
   In 1961, he published ``Bayazet,'' about the Russo-Turkish War
of 1877-78. Other books included ``With Pen and Rapier''
(1970),``Moon Sound'' (1973) and ``Word and Deed'' (1975).

<HEAD>GAO Critical of Social Security 800 Number</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Social Security Administration's new
telephone system is leaving many people waiting in vain for their
calls to be returned, government auditors said Tuesday.
   The General Accounting Office said that, in some types of cases,
42 percent of callers never received the follow-up calls they were
promised when they dialed Social Security's toll-free 800 number.
   Social Security follows up 97 percent of the time in other
categories, the report said.
   ``It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Social
Security 800 system is not a working number, or at least that it is
not working very well,'' said Rep. Andy Jacobs Jr., D-Ind.,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Social Security subcommittee.
   GAO, an arm of Congress, began investigating the phone system
after Social Security blocked telephone access to its local field
offices. Social Security officials insisted that requiring that all
calls be made to the 800 number would improve service.
   Jacobs said the GAO study offered proof that service had not
been improved.
   While it may save time for Social Security workers, Jacobs said,
it wastes the time of people the government is supposed to be
serving.
   He said 800-number operators lack training and expertise to
answer non-routine calls. Although it's far easier to get through
to the 800 number than it was earlier this year, Jacobs said, a
caller still will get a busy signal 35 percent of the time.
   Social Security spokesman Frank Battistelli said the agency
would not comment because it had not been given a copy of the GAO
report.
   However, he said that at least 80 percent of problems or
questions posed in calls to the 800 number are settled on the spot,
without the need for any call back or referral to a field office.
   Even after repeated unsuccessful attempts to get back to a
caller, Social Security offices don't let a case ``slip through the
cracks,'' Battistelli said.
   ``We then send a letter asking the caller to get back in touch
with us,' he said.
   Social Security expects to receive as many as 70 million calls
this year; GAO estimated that only about 5 percent require
referrals.
   GAO acknowledged the difficulty in trying to get back to a
caller. In doing its survey, GAO said, its workers were unable to
make contact in five attempts with many of those who had called the
800 number.

   British opposition leader Neil Kinnock
discussed with President Bush on Tuesday the growing momentum
toward German unification and pressed for Western aid to the Soviet
Union.
   Kinnock, on a two-day visit to the United States, hopes to
convince U.S. officials and lawmakers that his Labor Party would be
a more reliable partner for Washington in the new Europe than the
government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   ``I hope we were able to present a prospective government of the
United Kingdom ... as a reliable partner in NATO'' and within the
European Economic Community, said Gerald Kaufman, the Labor Party's
shadow foreign minister. He spoke to reporters after Kinnock's
30-minute meeting with Bush, which he described as ``extremely
useful and amicable.''
   Kinnock and Bush talked about Monday's announcement by Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev that the Soviet Union would allow a
united Germany in NATO. The two also talked about aiding Eastern
Europe and the Soviets, with Kinnock emphasizing the need to
provide frustrated Soviet consumers with goods.
   ``We talked about how to help the Soviets without being
patronizing,'' said Kaufman.
   Kinnock differs from Thatcher and Bush in believing Europe
should help the Soviet Union with more than just technical advice.
The aid from Britain should be loans and investment resulting in
the purchase of British goods, he emphasized in a speech Monday to
the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. He said it was
premature to assign a monetary figure to aid at this time.
   Kaufman said Kinnock congratulated Bush on his role in bringing
about a relaxation of NATO's defense strategy at the 16-nation
alliance summit in London earlier this month.
   The changed strategy enabled Gorbachev to make his decision
about NATO membership for a united Germany, Kaufman quoted Kinnock
as saying.

<HEAD>EEC Being Pressured on Export Subsidies</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Textile Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is putting more pressure on
the European Economic Community to negotiate the elimination of
export subsidies from world trade, administration farm officials
said Tuesday.
   One of the weapons in the U.S. trade arsenal is the 5-year-old
Export Enhancement Program, which provides ``bonuses'' or subsidies
to make U.S. commodities cheaper for selected foreign buyers.
   But Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said the U.S. subsidy
program was modest compared with the $10 billion annually spent by
the 12-nation European trade bloc on farm export subsidies.
   Further, he said, the House Appropriations Committee recently
cut the subsidies under EEP to $500 million from the $900 million
the administration had requested.
   Yeutter said export subsidies were ``probably the most important
part'' of the ongoing trade negotiations under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The 97-member GATT is scheduled to conclude the current Uruguay
Round of talks by the end of this year.
   ``If we can have a successful negotiation on export subsidies, a
lot of countries around the world will benefit, including the
United States,'' Yeutter told a telephone news conference with a
group of farm broadcasters.
   Undersecretary Richard T. Crowder, who oversees international
and commodity programs in the Agriculture Department, said EEP
programs were ``in place for all the major targeted customers and
markets'' of American farmers.
   Crowder said the subsidy programs served a dual purpose:
achieving and maintaining a market share for U.S. agricultural
exports, and ``for the trade policy effect that it will have on the
(EEC), particularly as we enter the critical phase'' of the trade
talks.
   ``So, we are prepared to use EEP as aggressively as possible to
ensure our competitiveness in the world market against those $10
billion of export subsidies,'' he said.
   Yeutter, asked if EEC policies had changed as a result of
trading pressure over the years, said there has been ``very
little'' so far.
   ``They have been bringing their (domestic) price support levels
down in a modest way over the last two or three years but not
enough to have very much effect on production thus far,'' he said.
``We've been pointing out to them they need to bring those
stratospheric supports down much closer to world market prices.''
   The high supports stimulate production, and the surpluses are
dumped on the world market through EEC export subsidies, Yeutter
said.
   Yeutter was asked if the United States had backed off at last
week's economic summit in Houston from an earlier position calling
for the elimination of export subsidies.
   ``We have by no means altered the U.S. position,'' Yeutter said.
``We did not have to change it one iota in Houston.''
   The key language used in the Houston agreement was worked out a
year or so ago and remained unchanged, he said. It calls for a
``substantial, progressive reduction'' in subsidies.
   ``We believe that calls for ultimate elimination,'' Yeutter
said. ``The EEC) knows that's our interpretation.''
   But how long that might require is another matter, he said. The
United States has proposed a five-year phase-out of export
subsidies, but the EEC ``objects vigorously'' to that timetable,
Yeutter said.

   A former armored car guard who stole
$651,000 from a truck and claimed he gambled it away during two
years on the lam was sentenced to eight years in prison Tuesday by
a skeptical judge.
   U.S. District Judge Louis C. Bechtle imposed a stiffer sentence
on Edward Leigh Hunt Jr. than guidelines suggested because Hunt
refused to detail how the money was spent.
   ``I have some concerns about the gaps in information as to what
happened to the money,'' Bechtle said.
   Guidelines indicated a sentence of 27 to 33 months, but the
sentencing commission's intent was ``thwarted by a refusal of the
defendant to cooperate,'' the judge said.
   ``The system, I believe, is being used,'' he said.
   Hunt, 26, stole the money on Jan. 20, 1988, from a Brooks
Armored Car Service truck parked outside a center city bank.
   He said said he spent the next two years in Hollywood, gambling
illegally on sports and buying California lottery tickets,
sometimes a hundred at a time.
   Two years later, ``I was broke so I turned myself in,'' he told
Bechtle.
   Hunt surrendered Jan. 20. He pleaded guilty in April to one
count of interstate theft in a plea agreement that required him to
tell investigators where the money went.
   Hunt, a Wilmington, Del., resident and son of a former Delaware
deputy attorney general, told the judge he feared facing additional
illegal gambling charges if he detailed where the money went.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Frederick Herold said the judge made it
clear when Hunt pleaded guilty that participating in the
investigation into the whereabouts of the money was very important.
   ``The big question in this case from the government's point of
view,'' Herold told the judge, ``is did he really gamble the money
away?''
   Hunt was also fined $3,000 and ordered to make restititution to
Brooks. The maximum sentence allowed was 10 years, and Herold said
Hunt would probably serve nearly all eight years, unless he gets
time off for good behavior. ``There is no parole,'' he said.
   Hunt showed no emotion as Bechtle pronounced sentence. His
attorney, Albert J. Raman, put his hand on Hunt's shoulder. Raman
declined to comment on the sentencing.
   Hunt spoke briefly, telling the judge that ``jail's a terrifying
experience,'' and suggested his sentence include outside work.
   ``I'd like to help Philadelphia by picking up garbage or
removing graffiti _ some kind of public service,'' Hunt told
Bechtle.
   The day after his theft, Hunt said, he got on a train and three
days later was at a Holiday Inn in Hollywood.
   ``They wouldn't take anyone who didn't have credit cards, and I
only had cash,'' Hunt told the judge, prompting chuckles from
spectators. He said he lived in a hotel and an apartment on the
same block as the Holiday Inn.
   Hunt claimed he planned to use a ``gambling system'' to
quadruple his stake and pay back the company half his proceeds. He
said he bet heavily on football and basketball through bookmakers
because legal gambling in Las Vegas was too risky.
   ``As a fugitive, I wouldn't have lasted a week there,'' he said,
referring to surveillance at legal gambling parlors and
requirements to report winnings over $10,000.
   He said he spent $50,000 on state lottery tickets.

<HEAD>Investigator Says Tougher Regulation of Medical Devices Needed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flaws in the Food and Drug Administration's
regulation of medical devices may allow unsafe products on the
market, witnesses told a House panel on Tuesday.
   Investigations by the inspector general of the Health and Human
Services Department suggest the FDA's regulatory system may prevent
the agency from detecting device problems early and acting
promptly, Inspector General Richard Kusserow said.
   Kusserow said the problems with the medical device approval
process ``parallel what we encountered in our extensive reviews of
the generic drug division,'' which turned up evidence that generic
drug companies had cheated on tests required to win FDA approval
and bribed FDA officials.
   ``Although our findings here are similar, we have no evidence of
these vulnerabilities manifesting themselves in any detected
criminal wrongdoing,'' Kusserow told the House Energy and Commerce
health subcommittee.
   The inspector general said that in addition to needing more
internal controls over the approval system, the FDA also needs
stronger authority to remove defective devices from the marketplace.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the committee, said,
``It is clear that the current statute does not adequately protect
the public from unnecessary risks. In addition, the FDA lacks the
resources and the authority to enforce the law.''
   Dingell and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the health
subcommittee, have introduced legislation to overhaul the law
governing regulation of medical devices.
   It would require closer scrutiny of the most dangerous devices
and require hospitals and other major medical device users to
report deaths and other serious problems with medical devices to
the FDA. It also would give the FDA more authority to remove
products from the market.
   More than 1,700 medical devices are available in the United
States, representing an industry of more than $17 billion a year,
said Carl Wisler of the General Accounting Office.
   FDA Acting Commissioner James Benson said in his statement to
the subcommittee that reporting the provision of the Dingell-Waxman
bill ``is neither necessary nor feasible.''
   He said he also opposes another provision that would require
more devices to undergo more intensive scrutiny even though they
were similar to devices already on the market. He said this
provision ``would lengthen product review times, raise health care
costs and impede the introduction of new technologies to the
market.'

   Prosecutors neared the end of their month-long
drug and perjury case against Mayor Marion Barry on Tuesday after
two women _ a former Carter administration aide and a Barry friend
testifying under court order _ outlined a history of drug use with
him.
   They were the ninth and tenth witnesses to testify they saw
Barry use illegal drugs.
   Doris Crenshaw, who was a White House small business aide, said
she had snorted cocaine powder, smoked crack cocaine and used
cocaine-laced cigarettes with Barry _ including an episode at the
1988 Democratic National Convention. She said she began using drugs
with him in 1985.
   Bettye Lynn Smith, who was flown in from Tennessee under court
order, testified she had used cocaine with Barry many times and
supplied him with it for years, including less than a month before
his Jan. 18 arrest in an FBI sting operation.
   Reluctant to testify against Barry, whom she described as ``a
close personal friend of mine,'' Smith appeared in court only after
being ordered by a U.S. magistrate to return to the nation's
capital to testify. She had been undergoing treatment for stress at
a psychiatric hospital in Chattanooga.
   Crenshaw said she and the mayor used cocaine at the Democratic
convention in Atlanta, where Barry was heading the District of
Columbia's delegation.
   ``We used it at the hotel,'' Crenshaw said. ``It was powder
cocaine.''
   Crenshaw, who met Barry when both were active in the civil
rights movement, described him as ``a very kind and understanding
and sympathetic person.''
   She said she first offered the mayor powder cocaine at her
Capitol Hill home where ``we snorted it ... off business cards.''
   Crenshaw also testified that she used drugs with Barry on Dec.
22, 1988, the day Barry's ties to Charles Lewis, who later pleaded
guilty to drug charges, became public.
   She said she visited the mayor that day at the Washington hotel
room of Willie Davis, a former aide to Birmingham Mayor Richard
Arrington.
   There, Barry smoked crack cocaine out of a pipe fashioned from a
drinking glass and tin foil, said Crenshaw testified. She said she
also used the drug.
   Prosecutors expected to conclude their case Wednesday with
testimony on Barry telephone records. The defense will then open
its case, which could include testimony from 10 to 15 witnesses,
said Barry attorney R. Kenneth Mundy.
   Since testimony in the case began June 19, 10 witnesses have
said they saw Barry use drugs at a total of 14 hotels, 20 private
residences, two businesses and on four boats in a period ranging
from 1984 to the mayor's Jan. 18 arrest at a downtown Washington
hotel.
   On Tuesday, Smith was questioned about her fitness to testify by
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who had demanded
her return pending the dawn magistrate's hearing in Chattanooga.
   ``I'll try,'' Smith said, choking back tears.
   Once the trial questioning began, Smith described in a soft,
calm voice a long history of drug use with Barry.
   Smith told the jury that she and the mayor snorted cocaine
powder at her Capitol Hill home ``maybe five times'' in 1983 and up
to half a dozen times a year after that until 1986 when she stopped
using the drug with him. She continued to supply him, she said.
   On the other hand, Smith also testified she never saw Barry use
or possess cocaine in the Bahamas _ even though other witnesses
have testified that she and the mayor used drugs during a
Thanksgiving 1987 trip there.
   Early this January was the last time she offered cocaine to the
mayor, she said. He went in the bathroom and ``was in there long
enough to use the cocaine ... but I don't know if he ingested it,''
Smith said.
   On Jan. 18, former model Rasheeda Moore persuaded Barry to come
to her room at the Vista Hotel, where the mayor was arrested after
being videotaped smoking crack cocaine.
   During cross-examination by Mundy, Smith said prescription
antidepressants she had taken Tuesday morning prevented her from
recalling exact dates on which she supplied the mayor with drugs.
   Barry is accused of 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession counts,
one misdemeanor count of conspiracy and three felony counts of
lying to a grand jury.
   Attending Tuesday's court proceedings was Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan, who was allowed access to the trial last week
after the judge reversed himself. Jackson had previously barred the
Muslim leader, ruling that his presence might intimidate witnesses
and jurors in the case.
   At a lunch recess, Farrakhan termed the case ``an assault on
black people in general.''

<HEAD>OSHA Wants To Lower Limit For Asbestos Exposure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal limit on workplace exposure to
asbestos would be cut in half under a change proposed Tuesday by
the Labor Department.
   About 700,000 American workers in general industry, mostly in
auto repair operations, and up to another 1.4 million construction
and building renovation workers would be affected by the revised
guideline, said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   Now OSHA rules permit workers to be exposed to no more than 0.2
fibers of asbestos per cubic centimeter of air over an 8-hour
period. The proposed change would cut that limit to 0.1 fiber per
cubic centimeter of air over an 8-hour shift.
   ``OSHA believes that the proposals will significantly reduce
worker deaths from cancer resulting from exposure to asbestos,''
said Gerard Scannell, the assistant labor secretary who heads OSHA.
   The revision to the OSHA standard will not take effect until
after a public comment period and a hearing in October.
   The change also calls for:
   _Expanding the notification provision for owners of buildings
where demolition, renovation and asbestos removal activities are
taking place. Under the change, they would have to notify occupants
of asbestos-disturbing activities and steps being taken to reduce
exposure risks.
   _All employers engaged in demolition, renovation and removal
operations other than small-scale, short-term operations would have
to notify OSHA before starting work.
   The Environmental Protection Agency is phasing out, between this
August and 1996, the future manufacture, importation, processing
and distribution of asbestos in almost all products.
   OSHA's proposal would allow employers to meet the new 0.1 fiber
requirement, without additional engineering control costs, by using
respiratory protection for workers until the new EPA guidelines
take effect.
   The change comes from a 1988 federal appeals court ruling that
generally upheld the current standard but asked OSHA to re-examine
several issues relating to asbestos.

   President Bush told a visiting delegation of
Japanese lawmakers Tuesday that the relationship between the United
States and Japan is ``absolutely vital.''
   Bush discussed trade, Soviet relations, the breakthrough on
Germany and other issues with the delegation of legislators from
both the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and opposition parties.
   Kichi Miyazawa, a former deputy prime minister and senior member
of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's Liberal Democratic Party, told
Bush the U.S.-Japanese relationship was becoming ``more and more
complex and important.''
   He led a group of 11 lawmakers, including eight opposition party
leaders.
   ``I hope I need not tell you this, but the relationship between
Japan and the United States is absolutely vital, and it does not
depend on the relationship the United States has with other
countries. It stands on its own two feet,'' Bush said.
   Afterwards, Miyazawa told reporters he congratulated Bush on
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's agreement to NATO membership
for the united Germany.
   Miyazawa also thanked Bush for his strong support at the Houston
economic summit for the Japanese claim to the four northern
territories controlled by the Soviet Union since the end of World
War II.
   ``That will certainly facilitate our position when we are going
to negotiate the matter with President Gorbachev'' when the Soviet
leader visits Japan next year, Miyazawa said.
   Miyazawa said Bush also discussed the Uruguay Round of trade
talks, but provided no details. Other Japanese officials said Bush
stressed the talks cannot succeed unless agricultural issues are
dealt with. The United States has applied heavy pressure on Japan
to open up its rice markets.
   The president and the lawmakers also discussed the Japanese plan
to resume a $5.4 billion loan to China interrupted last year after
the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
   Bush told Kaifu in Houston the United States would not stand in
Japan's way, but the summit as a whole decided to keep economic
sanctions imposed on China last year.
   Miyazawa said the Houston summit gave ``some understanding'' to
the Japanese position on aid or China.
   He said Bush told the lawmakers that the summit countries expect
China to take more ``concrete steps'' to respect human rights.
   Miyazawa is visiting China next week and he said Bush suggested
he convey that message to the authorities in Beijing.
   Michael Armacost, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, attended the
White House meeting with Bush, National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft and Robert Gates, Scowcroft's deputy.

<HEAD>Artillery Accident Kills Five Israeli Soldiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An off-target 155mm artillery shell landed near
reserve soldiers during a training exercise Tuesday and killed five
of them and wounded 10, the army command said.
   It said three of the wounded were badly hurt.
   Less than three months ago, on April 23, seven Israeli airmen
were killed in another training accident when their transport
helicopters collided during a flight over the occupied West Bank.
   The army said in a statement that Tuesday's accident occurred
when a reserve unit was conducting an exercise involving the
capture of a position at a training base in southern Israel.
   Army officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
base was near Tzeelim in the southern Negev desert, 15 miles from
the Egyptian border.
   Israel radio said the shell was fired by troops training at one
section of the base and fell near other soldiers training in a
different area.
   ``According to the information I have, the reason for the
accident was human error,'' Maj. Gen. Uri Saguy told Israel army
radio.
   Saguy, chief of army ground forces, was at the exercise and
ordered an immediate investigation, the army said.
   One of those wounded, 29-year-old Yair Cohen, told Israel radio
from his bed at Soroka Hospital in Beersheba:
   ``I stepped out of the armored personnel carrier and there was
an explosion. ... I was hit in the leg by shrapnel. I felt pain in
my leg and saw blood and started running.''
   Israeli men up to the age of 55 serve up to a month each year on
reserve duty after three years of compulsory service starting at
age 18.
   One of those seriously wounded Tuesday was a female instructor.

<HEAD>Beijing University Freshmen Return after Military Training</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Beijing University's freshman class completed a
year of training at an army base and was welcomed back to campus on
Tuesday by happy parents and curious upperclassmen.
   The 728 students were the first freshmen at the university since
last year's mass pro-democracy movement. Beijing University
students helped lead those protests, which were crushed by the
army. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of people died when the army
moved in on the Beijing demonstrators June 3-4, 1989.
   The freshmen were ordered to undergo a year of military training
and political education at Shijiazhuang Military Academy before
starting their regular, four-year classes.
   They lived the lives of soldiers, rising at 6 a.m. for marches
and drills on marching, saluting, shooting and throwing grenades.
   They attended political study classes where they read the works
of Marx, Lenin and Mao Tse-tung and heard lectures about the error
of last year's protests.
   The class graduated from the academy last Saturday and will
spend three days on campus for welcoming activities and orientation
before going home.
   Upperclassmen watched the new students with interest, some with
bemused expressions.
   A law school senior keep shaking his head and repeating,
``They're so young. They look so well-behaved.''
   One mother, who waited more than an hour for the freshmen to
arrive Tuesday, said she and other parents took turns making weekly
visits to the army base, about 170 miles south of Beijing, the
capital.
   ``We went to give them emotional support. They were really
lonely out there,'' she said.
   As she spoke, a caravan of buses carrying the students dressed
in army uniforms rolled through the school gate, under a red banner
reading, ``Warmly welcome the class of 1989 from the military
academy.''
   The mother anxiously scanned the faces, waving a brightly
colored skirt she had brought for her youngest daughter.
   ``What's the matter with them? They looked dumbfounded,'' she
said.
   But other students were hanging out the windows waving happily
to the crowd. Two even flashed V signs.
   A man and a woman took turns announcing flowery words of welcome
on the school's public address system, between military marches.
   Friends embraced and parents rushed to take heavy backpacks from
their children in an open area near a cafeteria.
   ``Happy? Of course I'm happy,'' one father said while loading
his daughter's belongings on his bicycle to take to her dormitory.
``I haven't seen her since Spring Festival,'' or Chinese New Year
in late February.
   His daughter, wearing her army uniform of olive shirt and dark
blue skirt, said of the year of military training, ``Well, at least
it's over.''
   The State Council, China's Cabinet, last week announced that the
new freshmen class this fall at Beijing University and Shanghai's
Fudan University would also undergo a year of military training. At
other schools, shorter periods of army training have been organized.
   The renewed emphasis on military training reflects leadership
belief that weak ideological education was to blame for last year's
pro-democracy movement.

Presidency</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo said Tuesday that if
Republicans keep challenging him to run for president, they just
might get their wish.
   Democrat Cuomo, speaking to reporters in this town west of
Binghamton, took note of recent partisan attacks from federal drug
czar William Bennett and U.S. Rep. Newt Gingrich.
   ``Last night, Gingrich got up and said, `Let Mario run,''' Cuomo
said. ``He said I should run, Bennett said I should run. They're
being so nice about it, they might just change my mind.''
   Georgia Republican Gingrich told the audience at the annual New
York Republican Party dinner Tuesday that Cuomo was a high-taxing
liberal who should run for president to ``put to rest the claim
that liberalism can win in America.''
   Bennett last month came to Albany to attack Cuomo administration
drug policy, daring Cuomo to run for president in 1992. Bennett
told the New York Daily News this week he got a personal thank you
call from President Bush after his comments on Cuomo.
   Cuomo spokesman Gary Fryer said Cuomo, who's running for a third
term as governor, was just being humorous at his Nichols stop.
   ``With a little bit of fun, the governor is just trying to make
the point that they're a lot more concerned about the future than
he is,'' Cuomo said. ``He's still concerned about the present.''

   Rainshowers and thunderstorms during the afternoon Tuesday
brought a threat of floods in Texas.
   In south-central Texas and Rio Grande plains of Texas, where
rain and thunderstorms continued into the afternoon, the threat of
further flooding continued.
   Beeville, Texas, got 10.64 inches of rain the 24 hours ending at
2 p.m. EDT. Up to 15 inches of rain fell in two days, causing
extensive lowland flooding along the Guadalupe, Aransas, Nueces and
Mission rivers.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from Florida north through
Virginia and west through the eastern three-fourths of Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over northwest
California, parts of Nebraska, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin,
Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York state.
   Heavier rainfall in the 6 hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT included
1.71 inches at Del Rio, Texas.
   Pueblo, Colo., tied its record low of 54. The record has stood
since 1891.
   Tuesday's low in the Lower 48 states was 42 at West Yellowstone,

<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein said Tuesday he
hopes Iraq's direct talks with Iran will lead to peace between the
two nations, and Iran's Hashemi Rafsanjani also expressed optimism
that a settlement was possible.
   The two Persian Gulf neighbors fought for eight years before the
guns fell silent under a United Nations-sponsored cease-fire in
August 1988.
   Foreign ministers Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran and Tariq Aziz of
Iraq met in Geneva this month for their first face-to-face talks
since the cease-fire.
   ``The Iranians responded favorably to our proposal for a summit
meeting and we hope that recent diplomatic and ministerial meetings
will pave the way for progress toward peace,'' Saddam said in a
speech broadcast on state Baghdad Radio.
   His address marked the 22nd anniversary of the coup that put his
Baath Arab Socialist Party in power.
   On Tuesday, Tehran Radio, monitored in Cyprus, quoted Rafsanjani
as telling Tehran's Assembly of Experts: ``The talks have been
fruitful, and the two countries are expected to move toward peace.
   ``The Iraqis, too, have adopted a more positive stand toward the
establishment of peace.''
   Rafsanjani was quoted as saying both Iran and Iraq realize now
only ``the arrogant powers,'' a common Iranian reference to the
United States and its Western allies, ``benefit from the no-war,
no-peace situation in the gulf.''
   The English-language Tehran Times, a newspaper close to
Rafsanjani, urged that future meetings be held in Baghdad or Tehran.
   Iraq has been pushing for a Saddam-Rafsanjani summit.
   The Tehran Times said nothing was achieved at Geneva beyond
creating an ``amiable atmosphere.''
   U.N.-brokered talks began five days after the cease-fire but
quickly collapsed. Iran insisted Iraq withdraw from territories
occupied in the last weeks of the war. Iraq said Iran must agree
first to dredge the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway, confluence of the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers, of war debris.
   A 1975 treaty drew the border down the middle of the 120-mile
channel, giving Iran navigation rights to the strategic waterway
for the first time.
   Iraq unilaterally abrogated that treaty when it invaded Iran in
September 1980 following border clashes, and demanded full
sovereignty over the waterway.
   But Velayati told theologians in Qom on Tuesday the talks were
being held within the framework of that treaty, Iran's Islamic
Republic News Agency said.
   It quoted him as saying Iran would ``welcome goodwill gestures
from Iraqi officials.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday described his
administration as a catalyst for dialogue in South Africa, saying
it is important that President F. W. de Klerk now visit the White
House after Nelson Mandela's recent trip.
   No date has been set for a de Klerk visit, although Bush
extended an invitation earlier this year. Mandela, the African
National Congress leader freed by de Klerk after 27 years in
prison, met with Bush during a nationwide tour last month.
   Bush predicted that de Klerk's visit will be ``somewhat
controversial'' because of widespread opposition to Pretoria's
apartheid policies of racial separation.
   ``There will be a lot of picketers out here. I think they're
wrong,'' Bush told a gathering of magazine publishers at the white
House.
   ``I think in de Klerk you have a new kind of leader in South
Africa,'' Bush said, adding that he had detected in Mandela ``quite
a respect'' for de Klerk.
   Bush reiterated that U.S. economic sanctions against South
Africa will not be lifted until there is more movement toward
ending apartheid. But he also said he does not want the sanctions
toughened.
   He said Mandela called him before he left the United States
``with a feeling that the United States government had been
responsive and certainly interested.''
   ``I think more than any of the European countries we can be
catalytic. We were not a colonial power and we are united in our
opposition to apartheid,'' Bush said. ``And then we have an
Afro-American population here that feels fervently, this is a gut
issue. And I think that's a good thing that might not be quite as
prominent in other countries as well.''
   ``Those ingredients make our country uniquely able to serve as a
catalyst between the various factors in South Africa, and that's
what I want to try to do.''

<HEAD>Federal Judge Rejects Woman's Claim of Skin-Tone Discrimination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for a black woman who lost her fight
to prove she was fired from her IRS job because of her light skin
tone says it was a difficult case to prove, and he doesn't know
whether his client will appeal.
   ``She seemed confident, not totally surprised about it, a little
upset, and said it's time to move on with her life,'' attorney
Hillard J. Flint said after talking to Tracy L. Morrow.
   U.S. District Judge Charles A. Moye Jr. ruled Monday that Ms.
Morrow lost her job because she had a poor attitude that eventually
led to her dismissal, not because of her skin color.
   Ms. Morrow had contended she was targeted for harassment by her
boss, Ruby Lewis, and was fired from her job as a clerk-typist for
the Internal Revenue Service because of her lighter skin tone.
   Ms. Lewis had said that Ms. Morrow was error-prone, belligerent,
frequently late and dishonest.
   In his ruling, Moye said, ``There was considerable testimony,
not only from Ms. Lewis, but from others, that the plaintiff,
unlike her fellow employees, may have been insubordinate, immature,
impatient, disrespectful and unmanageable.''
   Flint said that without testimony to support Ms. Morrow's
claims, it was a ``difficult case to prove.''
   Ms. Morrow, a former IRS temporary employee in Seattle, was
hired in Atlanta as a clerk typist in 1985. She entered probation
for a permanent position on Dec. 9, 1985, but was fired on March
14, 1986.
   Moye last year ruled that such light vs. dark, black-on-black
discrimination is possible and that the issue should be decided in
court.
   A non-jury trial was held earlier this year on Ms. Morrow's
claims.
   Moye, who made his ruling after examining closing briefs filed
by both sides, said Ms. Morrow failed to prove anything other than
that there was animosity between the two women.
   ``Other than the testimony by plaintiff, the record is devoid of
any testimony or evidence that would lead this court to believe
that Ms. Lewis would be likely color-biased,'' the order said.
   Curtis E. Anderson, head of the U.S. Attorney's civil division,
said he was pleased with the decision.
   Ms. Morrow, reached at her Union City home, indicated she did
not know about the judge's ruling.
   ``Wow. Hmm. Wow,'' she said, before hanging up.
   Ms. Morrow had sought up to $60,000 in back pay and other
payments, plus reinstatement to her job.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Press Freedom Committee on Tuesday
urged all organizations hoping to foster a free press in Eastern
Europe to coordinate their efforts through a meeting next October.
   ``An entirely new dimension of needs and opportunities faces all
of us,'' said Harold W. Andersen, chairman of the committee and
former publisher of the Omaha World-Herald Company. ``We all need
to know what is being done _ and not being done.''
   He urged interested organizations to take part in a one-day
conference at the National Press Club in Washington on Oct. 10.
   The 14-year-old committee, which represents 33 national and
international news organizations from five continents, has already
surveyed the media of Eastern Europe and has prepared a list of
possible projects.
   It also has published a ``Handbook for Journalists of Central
and Eastern Europe'' and is serving as a clearing house for media
organizations to match needs and resources.
   ``A substantial number of people and organizations, both public
and private, are trying to help,'' said Anderson. ``We need to
share information as to who is doing what. This should help all
parties avoid duplication and cooperate more freely.''
   He said the committee wanted participation from every
organization already helping East European media or even thinking
about it and urged them to contact the committee's Washington
office.

dropped by one-third since Jan. 1 and said prospects for the rest
of the year were ``very uncertain.''
   Czechoslovakia imports 16.6 million tons of crude per year from
the Soviet Union, the sole source of oil and natural gas for the
country.
   ``The lower supplies of oil just happened. That is a fact. And
the only way to cut consumption is to increase the prices,'' Klaus
said.
   Pressed for figures, Klaus said the price rise would be
``probably more than 50 percent.'' But he refused to be more
specific, saying the new prices would be announced later.
   Klaus did not say when the new prices would become effective,
but Economics Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said Monday it would be ``a
matter of days.''
   The current price of gasoline in Czechoslovakia is about $1.10
per gallon. The average monthly income is about $200.
   During four decades of Communist rule, Czechoslovakia, like
other East bloc nations, was fully dependent on the Soviet Union
for oil. This spared them the oil crises the West suffered through
in the 1970s.
   ``Right now and especially at the beginning of next year when
imports from the Soviet Union will be payable in hard currency, we
are going to pay for those two crises we have managed to ignore,''
Klaus said.
   Comecon, the Soviet-led Eastern trading bloc, has agreed to
switch to hard currency accounting as of Jan. 1.
   Klaus said talks were underway with Venezuela, Iran and Iraq to
try to secure other sources of oil.
   Planned radical economic reforms to begin next year are to raise
prices in the country to approximate world levels while lowering
the exchange rate and making the currency convertible.

   Six people promoting gay rights were arrested
Tuesday after staging a vocal sit-in in the office of Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., authorities said.
   The four women and two men were charged with unlawful entry and
demonstrating within a building in the Capitol, said U.S. Capitol
Police Officer Dan Nichols. Each offense carries a maximum fine of
$500 and six months in jail.
   The six were arrested in the reception room of Helms' Senate
office.
   ``They started chanting, they sat down and refused to leave when
ordered to,'' Nichols said.
   Lee Bush, a spokesman for the group, said the activists were
upset because they believe Helms has blocked AIDS funding.

<HEAD>Army Says Absent Soldiers May Have Been in Cult</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GULF BREEZE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six soldiers who disappeared from a
classified intelligence unit in West Germany and believed to be
members of a mysterious group called ``The End of the World'' have
been caught in Florida.
   The five men and one woman, caught over the weekend in this
Florida Panhandle city, were being held at Fort Benning, Ga.,
pending a counterintelligence investigation.
   However, Bob Hall, a spokesman for Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, said the counterintelligence investigation is being
conducted as a matter of routine because the soldiers had access to
classified information.
   ``The Army says this does not appear to be an espionage case,''
said Hall.
   Maj. Joe Padilla, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon, said he had
no information about ``The End of the World'' group except that the
six are apparently members. He could not say if it has any
significance in the investigation, or how and when the Army came to
know of their affiliation.
   ``I've heard of a lot of cults but this is a new wrinkle,'' said
Gulf Breeze police Chief Jerry Brown.
   Dallas Blanchard, a sociology professor and cult expert at the
University of West Florida in nearby Pensacola, said he hadn't
heard of the group.
   All six soldiers were Army intelligence specialists assigned to
the 701st Military Intelligence Brigade at Augsburg, West Germany,
Padilla said. He wouldn't say exactly what jobs they performed but
that their training was in analyzing foreign communications.
   The Army hasn't filed charges against the six soldiers, Padilla
said.
   He said an absent-without-authorization allegation could
encompass either absent without leave or the more serious charge of
desertion.
   The disappearance came to the attention of military authorities
on July 9, Hall said. Brown said that is the date they arrived in
Gulf Breeze.
   Hall and Padilla said they didn't know how the six got to
Florida from Germany.
   The absent soldiers had been staying with two Gulf Breeze women,
Brown said. One of the women had met one of the male soldiers last
year in Gulf Breeze and struck up a friendship. He called her and
asked if the group could stay with them for a few days, Brown said.
   They were caught after one of the men was stopped by a police
officer Friday night because the taillights on the van he was
driving weren't working, Brown said.
   The man had no driver's license and warrants showed he had been
listed on Thursday as wanted for desertion from the Army, the chief
said.
   After officers called security police at the Pensacola Naval Air
Station to pick up the man, the Navy called back to say he was
traveling with five other soldiers also wanted for desertion or
being absent without leave, Brown said.
   Soon after, representatives of the FBI, the CIA and the National
Security Agency called his department as well, Brown said.
   Police learned that the five suspects might be at the home of
the Gulf Breeze women. Officers arrested the four men Saturday.
   At the home, police learned the woman was staying at a nearby
campground on the Gulf Island National Seashore near Fort Pickens,
where she was arrested, Brown said.
   The two Gulf Breeze women are not suspected of any wrongdoing,
but Brown said he may ask them some more questions after being told
of the apparent cult connection.
   ``They are just scared to death,'' he said.
   He said the soldiers did little more than sleep and watch
television while at the women's home. ``It sounds like they were
just resting up and then they were out,'' Brown said.

<HEAD>NTSB Cites Truck Driver In Texas School Bus Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVAN RAMSTAD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The driver of the truck that hit a Texas
school bus last fall, sending it into a water-filled pit and
killing 21 students, should have been able to stop despite faulty
brakes, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday.
   Forty-nine other students were injured in the accident near
Alton last September. It was the nation's worst school bus accident
since 1976.
   The lack of emergency exits _ there were only two _ contributed
to the number of deaths, the board said.
   NTSB Chairman James Kolstad said that there were ``clear
deficiencies'' in the truck's brakes but that driver Ruben Perez
``did not respond soon enough and he did not respond aggressively
enough.''
   Investigators found the truck's brakes were operating at about
two-thirds strength, which should been enough to stop the truck.
Perez had said he began applying the brakes 300 feet before the
collision.
   Perez said that the brakes failed and that he began to use those
on the truck's trailer, then downshifted gears to try to stop.
   Perez' attorney, Bob Binder of Austin, Texas, said the board was
``compounding a tragedy to put the blame on the driver when he was
given a truck with bad brakes.''
   ``The brakes were failing. They were not in complete failure but
they were failing. So he (Perez) downshifted, which is the proper
procedure, and applied the trailer brakes by hand,'' Binder said.
   Perez watched the NTSB hearing impassively. Binder would not let
Perez talk to reporters, citing a lawsuit Perez has filed against
Valley Coca-Cola Bottling Co., which owned the truck.
   The NTSB urged the bottling company to improve its
driver-training and fleet-maintenance programs.
   Most of the victims drowned because they couldn't get out of the
submerged bus, the NTSB said, calling for more emergency exits on
school buses.
   It made a similar recommendation last year in its report of the
May 1988 bus and truck collision in Kentucky that killed 27. That
accident involved a school bus converted for use by a church.
   The Texas collision was the worst U.S. school bus accident since
May 1976, when 29 were killed in a bus that plunged from a freeway
ramp near Martinez, Calif.
   In the Texas accident, the bus fell 25 feet into a water-filled
pit, flipped on its front end and settled. The windshield was
forced out and water rushed into the bus. The way the bus settled
rendered the rear emergency door useless.
   The NTSB recommended federal regulations requiring emergency bus
exits that would not close once they are opened.

<HEAD>Crisis Shows Power Politics, Patronage Still Dominate in India</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DILIP GANGULY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh's battle with
his chief rival in the Cabinet showed Tuesday that old-style
patronage still plays a big role in India's political life.
   But Singh's victory in the four-day government crisis also
demonstrated that India's traditional power politics may be
changing as the democracy matures.
   In last year's election, Singh ousted the Nehru-Gandhi family,
which had governed India virtually since independence in 1947. Over
the weekend, he forced the deputy prime minister, Devi Lal, to
rescind the appointment of his son to a powerful local post.
   Singh, a self-styled champion of clean politics, emerged from
the fight slightly muddied.
   ``No doubt V.P. Singh's image has suffered. The events have
damaged his reputation, but he will come out of it,'' predicted
Bhabani Sengupta, a political commentator for the Center for Policy
Research.
   ``What happened was a clash between the old style of politics
and the new style. Singh wanted to be democratic, but Devi Lal
played the bad old game and he lost,'' Sengupta said in an
interview.
   The crisis erupted last Thursday when Devi Lal engineered the
reappointment of his eldest son, Om Prakash Chautala, as chief
minister of the northern state of Haryana.
   Chautala, 55, previously held the post, but was accused of
indirect responsibility for election violence in his constituency
that killed at least 12 people, including an independent candidate.
He was forced to quit May 22, but the violence was never
investigated.
   News reports said his reappointment was part of a deal between
Singh and Devi Lal to end a cold war between them. Denials from
both failed to dispel all suspicion.
   Challenged by Devi Lal, Singh resorted to a threat to resign.
Many commentators thought it was a ploy, and he retracted the
threat within 24 hours.
   Before the conflict was resolved, 13 ministers in the 38-member
Cabinet, or Council of Ministers, resigned and the workings of
government came to a halt. Air force planes flew leaders from
around the nation to New Delhi, where about 100 meetings took place
in four days.
   The crisis ended Monday when Chautala agreed to step down ``for
the good of the party.'' His father remained in the Cabinet, and
the 13 ministers who quit were reinstated.
   But few believe the game has been decided. The skirmish exposed
the deep cracks in the governing Janata Dal party, which dominates
the five-party minority coalition and underlined the personal
hostility between Devi Lal and Singh.
   ``After all this mudslinging, it looks they all are friends
again,'' said Mool Chand Jain, a political analyst in Haryana.
``For them, political survival is more important than clean
politics.''
   Chautala inherited the post of Haryana's chief minister when it
was vacated by Devi Lal, a former wrestler and landowner who built
a power base on pro-farmer populism and political handouts.
   Indian news reports say that as many as 135 family members of
Devi Lal received government favors in one form or the other.
   ``Dynasty is natural,'' Devi Lal said in a magazine interview
recently. ``Everyone learns from the head of the family.''
   He added: ``I appoint my relatives because I have got control
over them. They will go by my directives.''
   Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi called the crisis an internal
affair of the Janata Dal party, but Gandhi's supporters enjoyed
watching Singh's difficulties.
   ``The events since Thursday have made it clear that the clean
government Mr. Singh had offered us is just a mirage,'' said one
official of Gandhi's Congress party.

<HEAD>Scientists Find People Can be Encouraged to Live More Healthy
Lives</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   People who eat too much fat and salt and don't
exercise enough already may know better, but a five-year research
project shows these destructive habits can be discouraged,
scientists said.
   There may be as many as 525 people alive today in Salinas and
Monterey, Calif., who would have died during the past 10 years if
it hadn't been for specially designed health education programs
there, said Dr. John W. Farquhar of Stanford University's school of
medicine.
   ``Methods do exist for self-improvement,'' Farquhar said in a
telephone interview Monday.
   After five years of community education, Farquhar said, the
average plasma cholesterol level among residents in Salinas and
Monterey was 2 percent below that of people in Modesto and San Luis
Obispo, which were used for comparison. He said the pulse rate was
3 percent lower; the smoking rate 13 percent lower.
   These figures mask the study's true importance, Farquhar said,
because people with higher levels would have experienced more
dramatic declines.
   Using a method developed by other researchers, the data from
Salinas and Monterey translates to a 15 percent improvement in the
mortality rate and a 16 percent decline in heart attack risks.
   Billions of dollars could be saved annually by this kind of
reduction in heart attacks nationally, said researchers, who
reported their findings in Wednesday's issue of the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   Because so many people continue their unhealthy habits despite
the risks, Farquhar and his associates reasoned that a program
going beyond mere education was needed.
   So, they prepared a special series of radio, television and
newspaper announcements and developed classes, meetings, mailings
and other approaches for delivering their message.
   The idea was not only to instruct residents on what's healthy
but also to train them on how to make changes.
   ``If you want to start a walking program, where to you get the
shoes, what kind of shoes do you get and how do you get the friend
down the block to go with you?'' Farquhar said, illustrating the
kinds of practical questions his program sought to answer.
   ``Or how do you get a healthy meal at a restaurant'' without
being obnoxious? he said. ``We got down to these kinds of
specifics.''
   Twice a week for a little more than five years, residents of
Salinas and Monterey were indoctrinated with this kind of
information.
   If the 15 percent decline in mortality rate proves accurate,
it's far better than Farquhar's expectation. ``We would have been
satisfied by 5 percent,'' he said.
   The Stanford researchers plan to count the number of deaths in
Monterey, Salinas, Modesto and San Luis Obispo to establish a more
precise mortality rate. The 15 percent cited in the study is an
estimate based on the improvement in cholesterol, blood pressure
and other health data.
   ``The study is very impressive,'' said Thomas M. Lasater, a
community health educator at Brown University involved in similar
research at Memorial Hospital of Rhode Island in Pawtucket.
   He said the direct medical costs for people with heart disease
is equivalent to $300 to $400 a year for every person in the United
States.
   Lasater said that if the improvement in mortality rate proves
accurate, the nation could save $11 billion or more a year if
Farquhar's methods could be applied across the country.
   The cost of Farquhar's program came to about $4 per person in
the cities each year. Farquhar estimated that this is 4 percent of
the annual per capita expenditure for cigarettes.
   ``What we're trying to do is get out a message of hope to policy
planners, health specialists, educators and others that methods do
exist to help communities help themselves,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The mystery of the missing manhole covers was
apparently solved Tuesday when some of the more than 185 purloined
lids turned up at a scrap-metal yard.
   The case had police and city workers scratching their heads as
covers disappeared at a rate of more than 25 a day for the past
week. They even considering the possibility of some bizarre new fad
among children.
   But on Tuesday, cast-iron manhole covers ranging in weight from
50 pounds to 200 pounds were found to have been sneaked into
truckloads of higher grade iron sold to the Downtown Metal Center.
The higher weight brought a higher price, said center manager
Robert Kelman.
   ``The manhole covers are pretty flat so they can hide them
well,'' said Kelman. ``Basically, they just used them to weigh down
the load.''
   No arrests had been made as of late Tuesday afternoon.
   ``Police are still pursuing additional leads,'' said Anna Sklar,
spokeswoman for the city Bureau of Sanitation.
   The discovery of Los Angeles City manhole covers in piles of old
pipes, truck bodies, and reinforcement bars solved the biggest
mystery in the disappearances: What use were the things?
   Since the covers by themselves were worth only $1.50 each at
scrap yards, police and city officials couldn't figure out why
anyone would bother trying to steal the heavy, unwieldy covers.
   The thief was dubbed ``Manhole Man'' but police don't know
whether it was a man, even a single person or a gang of thieves.
   One of the more unusual theories was the covers were being
stolen by fans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, stars of TV
cartoons, mass merchandising and a hit movie. The turtles use
manhole covers for shields.
   Most of the covers reported stolen were 2-foot diameter
cast-iron covers placed over sidewalk storm drains, but the metals
center received even larger, middle-of-the road covers.
   Detectives and workers at the metals center were digging through
heaps of metal to find out how many manhole covers were in the yard
and looking through files to trace the origin of the scrap metal
containing the manhole covers. They didn't immediately report how
many they had turned up.
   ``There is some kind of paper trail that can hopefully lead to
people who did this,'' said Kelman.
   Loads of scrap metal aren't checked closely; the yard simply
weighs the truck full, then empty. By weighing down the load of
higher grade iron with the lower-grade cast iron manhole covers,
the thieves stood to make about $10 more a ton, said Kelman.
   ``Not a lot, but it was something,'' he said.
   It had cost the city more than $15,000 to buy new covers and to
pay labor costs to replace them or cover the holes with plywood.
Officials were also worried a pedestrian could fall into the 2-foot
holes, but so far no injuries have been reported.

   The independent counsel investigating former
Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. was given a significantly
broader jurisdiction Tuesday to probe developers who received
federal housing grants during the Reagan administration.
   The court that supervises the work of independent counsel Arlin
M. Adams issued an order authorizing him to scrutinize developers,
lobbyists or others who sought and obtained grants from three
programs run by the Department of Housing and Urban Development
from 1984 through 1988.
   Adams was appointed in March to investigate allegations that
Pierce and other HUD officials had showed illegal political
favoritism in awarding lucrative rent subsidies under the Moderate
Rehabilitation Program.
   The order by the independent counsel panel of the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals here also authorizes Adams to investigate
allegations of political favoritism in the operation of the Urban
Development Action Grant program and the Secretary's Discretionary
Fund for technical assistance and special projects.
   It also widens the circle of people who may be investigated to
include officials of other government agencies ``or other persons
and entities.''
   Adams's review of the operation of the two additional programs
was sought by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh in a May 25 letter
to the independent counsel.
   Thornburgh referred to allegations made by DuBois L. Gilliam, a
deputy assistant secretary at HUD, that political considerations
were an important factor in the award of UDAG and discretionary
funds.
   Gilliam, who is serving an 18-month sentence for corruption,
told the House Government Operations employment and housing
subcommittee that Pierce had ordered HUD to award grants to
politically connected developers.
   In one instance, Gilliam said, Pierce had ordered the approval
of a $5.6 million UDAG grant because his former executive
assistant, Lance H. Wilson, was a private consultant for the
developer of the Florida project.
   The original mandate authorized Adams, himself a former federal
appellate judge, to investigate whether Pierce and other HUD
officials ``may have committed the crime of conspiracy to defraud
the United States or any other federal crimes'' in selecting
developers to receive subsidies from the Moderate Rehabilitation
Program.
   The broader mandate issued Tuesday empowers Adams ``to fully
investigate and prosecute all government officials, or other
persons and entities for any federal crimes, including conspiracy
and aiding and abetting'' in connection with the operation of all
three programs.
   Pierce, who ran HUD for all eight years of the Reagan
administration, has denied any wrongdoing. He also told Congress
that he did not participate in the day-to-day operation of specific
programs and did not order his aides to award grants.
   But Gilliam offered a conflicting account in his congressional
testimony, telling lawmakers that Pierce had ordered him to
intervene in projects in Nashville, Cleveland and Miami that were
backed by influential Republicans.
   Gilliam, who pleaded guilty to conspiring to manipulate the
award of a grant and accepting $8,000 in illegal gratuities, is
cooperating with Adams' investigation under a grant of immunity
from prosecution, according to sources who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
   The investigation of the House subcommittee chaired by Rep. Tom
Lantos, D-Calif., also focused on the work of Republican
consultants and lobbyists who helped clients deal with HUD.
   These consultants included Paul Manafort, a partner in the
political consulting firm of Black, Manafort, Stone &amp; Kelly, and
James Watt, an interior secretary in the Reagan administration.
   Manafort, a leading campaign strategist for President Bush,
acknowledged to the panel that he engaged in ``influence peddling''
to help steer millions of dollars worth of HUD funds to a project
he partly owned. Manafort said his firm was also paid $326,000 to
help developers get HUD backing for a project in New Jersey.
   Watt said he met with Pierce to help developers win $28 million
worth of Moderate Rehabilitation Program subsidies for a suburban
Baltimore project.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. John East committed suicide because
government doctors failed to diagnose and treat him for a thyroid
disorder, attorneys for the North Carolina Republican's widow told
a federal judge Tuesday.
   ``This is a case about a death that never should have
occurred,'' attorney James Hourihan said in closing arguments in
Priscilla East's $3.5 million wrongful death lawsuit against the
federal government.
   East, convinced that late diagnosis of his condition had
permanently impaired his intellect, killed himself in his garage on
June 29, 1986, with carbon monoxide from a running car. He left a
note blaming his doctors, saying they ``ruined my health.''
   But federal attorneys said East, 55, freely chose to end his
life and had been pronounced cured of hypothyroidism for 11 months
when he died in Greenville, N.C.
   ``This man was able to control himself, was lucid in the last
six months of his life,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Ira Oring.
   U.S. District Judge Walter Black Jr., who heard the case without
a jury, took it under submission, saying he would rule in a timely
manner. He did not set a date.
   During an eight-week trial, Mrs. East's attorneys tried to prove
that Navy doctors, who provide medical care for Congress members,
were negligent in John East's care. Hourihan said that if
physicians had administered a simple blood test as early as April
1983, they would have detected East's thyroid deficiency.
   Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland fails to produce
the hormone needed to regulate the body's metabolism.
   Hourihan noted that for 52 years East had overcome such
obstacles as partial paralysis by polio, his brother's suicide and
parents' deaths. He pointed out that East was a lawyer and
political science professor at East Carolina University before
being tapped to run for the Senate in 1980 by the National
Congressional Club, the political organization of Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C.
   East lapsed into a coma when he was admitted to Bethesda Naval
Medical Center in April 1985. Not long after he regained
consciousness, East tried to kill himself by ramming a chair leg
down his throat, a manifestation of the psychotic state induced by
extreme hypothyroidism.
   East's condition was diagnosed when a hospital resident ordered
the appropriate blood test.
   Hourihan said that whether or not East's thinking abilities
actually were damaged after his metabolism was returned to normal,
the senator believed they were beyond repair. Hourihan said the
fact or the belief created in East an irresistible impulse to kill
himself attributable to Navy doctors' failure to treat the senator
according to medical standards.
   Hourihan faulted Rear Adm. Freeman Cary, head of the
congressional medical office, who Hourihan said treated East for a
myriad of symptoms over two years.
   ``Dr. Cary treated each of these problems separately, he never
put them together and tried to evaluate them,'' Hourihan said.
   But government defense attorney Oring contended that Mrs. East's
attorneys failed to show East's suicide was inevitable and a direct
result of the late diagnosis of his thyroid disorder.
   Oring showed a portion of a one-hour cable television interview
with the senator in May 1986, a month before his death, in which a
poised and articulate East discussed national politics.

   Two cosmonauts took a walk in space Tuesday to try
to repair a thermal blanket that has partially ripped apart and
could interfere with their safe return to Earth, Soviet media
reported.
   Cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin opened the
hatch of the Mir space station as the orbiting spacecraft entered
the shadow of the Earth, Radio Moscow reported.
   They moved along the outside of the station to their Soyuz TM-9
capsule, which is docked to the Mir, to inspect and make decisions
on whether they could repair the thermal insulation, the radio
report said.
   ``According to the results we have gotten so far ... we can
almost definitely state that it (the thermal insulation problem)
will not affect the landing,'' Vladimir A. Solovyev, a former
cosmonaut and the flight controller, said in a live report from
Baikonur Space Center on the evening news program ``Vremya.''
   He said the landing would take place on Aug. 9, as scheduled.
   The cosmonauts experienced some delays during their space walk,
but caught up to their schedule and the time spent on the walk
would total more than 4{ hours, the controller reported.
   There were no further reports immediately in the Soviet media on
whether they actually repaired the thermal insulation or other
results of their space walk.
   ``Vremya'' showed a fuzzy picture of the spacecraft, with what
appeared to be flapping thermal insulation. Part of the insulation
has been flapping uselessly for months.
   Earlier Tuesday, a correspondent for ``Vremya'' displayed some
of the tools the cosmonauts would use, including what looked liked
a large pair of shears.
   Soviet officials extended the cosmonauts' flight until Aug. 9 to
give them extra time to make the repairs, Soviet newspapers
reported last month. They had been scheduled to return July 30
after nearly six months in space.
   It was the latest in a series of problems in the Soviet Union's
manned space program, which for decades has been a source of
national pride. For the past two years, the program has been
plagued by docking equipment malfunctions, human error and budget
cuts.
   Soviet officials have minimized the danger, saying the capsule
could withstand such damage to its thermal blanket, the newsaper
Izvestia reported. James Oberg, an American specialist on the
Soviet space program, agreed.
   ``I don't think there's danger. I think there's anxiety over
something more going wrong,'' Oberg said last month in an interview.
   Nearly half the thermal blanket has separated from the capsule
and a 6{-foot-long section is hanging off, attached only on one
side, the newspaper Trud reported. The damage probably occurred
during launch of the capsule Feb. 11 when a ground rescue structure
scratched the thermal blanket, according to deputy flight director
Viktor Blagov.
   The American magazine Aviation Week and Space Technology
reported May 21 that because of the damage, the Soyuz spacecraft
had cooled and moisture built up inside. Izvestia said temperature
changes could damage equipment needed for re-entry.
   The space station is being turned twice daily to keep the
damaged section in the sunlight so it stays warm, and hot air is
being pumped from Mir into the capsule to prevent a moisture
buildup, Izvestia said.
   But Izvestia also said part of the ripped shield is blocking an
infrared sensor used for navigation, meaning a manually controlled
landing might be necessary. In addition, Izvestia said, the ripped
section might catch on an antenna attached to the Mir as the Soyuz
capsule undocks.
   Oberg said there was little threat the capsule would burn up
during its re-entry into the atmosphere because the thermal
blankets are separate from the shield used to protect the craft in
that phase of the flight.
   A new crew is scheduled to be launched Aug. 1 to occupy Mir
after Solovyev and Balandin leave.

<HEAD>Mandela Blames Apartheid for Regional Wars in Southern Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRA, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela said Tuesday that there
could be no lasting peace in the southern African region until
apartheid was ended in his homeland.
   The black South African leader said his country's white-minority
government bore a large responsibility for the civil wars in
Mozambique and Angola that have continued since the mid-1970s, the
Mozambican national news agency AIM reported.
   ``As long as apartheid exists, there can be no lasting peace in
Mozambique, or anywhere else in the region,'' Mandela told a rally
in the coastal city of Beira.
   ``A peace based on democracy and justice for all in South Africa
will result in establishing permanent peace in southern Africa,
especially in Mozambique and Angola,'' Mandela said.
   Mandela is scheduled to return to South Africa on Wednesday, his
72nd birthday, after a six-week, 14-nation tour of Africa, Europe
and North America to rally support for the African National
Congress.
   Mandela, the ANC's deputy president, is expected to meet soon
with South African President F.W. de Klerk to arrange further talks
aimed at clearing the way for full-scale constitutional
negotiations. Both sides say they want to negotiate a new
constitution that will give political rights to the 30-million
black majority.
   Mandela's tour has raised millions of dollars for the ANC as it
formally re-establishes itself after being legalized by de Klerk in
February. Mandela has also been urging foreign leaders to maintain
economic sanctions against South Africa despite de Klerk's reforms.
   During the 1980s, South Africa openly supported rebel movements
in Mozambique and Angola that were opposed to the Marxist
governments of those countries.
   South Africa signed a mutual non-aggression pact with Mozambique
in 1984, but until last year was repeatedly accused of violating
the pact. South Africa signed a peace treaty with Angola in 1988
shortly after removing all its troops from that country.
   The wars in Angola and Mozambique continue despite recent peace
talks aimed at resolving both conflicts.
   An estimated 600,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the
13-year-old insurgency waged by RENAMO, the Portuguese acronym for
the Mozambican National Resistance, against the leftist government.
   The war has left this former Portuguese colony one of the
world's poorest nations. The annual per capita income is about $200
and almost half of Mozambique's 15 million people require some
level of food assistance.
   In Angola, the rebel National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola, or UNITA, has been fighting the government since the
country gained its independence from Portugal in 1975.

   When President Bush needs help sleeping, he
reaches not for the medicine cabinet but for the bookshelf.
   The president said on Tuesday he doesn't have much use for the
popular sleeping drug, Halcion. Instead, he said he likes to read
about former presidents, Wall Street brokers and sleuths.
   ``Most of my reading is formal and heavy going,'' Bush said when
asked at a newspaper publishers' gathering what he reads for fun.
   For pleasure, he said he picks things that are not
``particularly weighty,'' he said.
   Recent selections, he said, included ``Bonfire of the
Vanities,'' Tom Wolfe's novel about a Wall Street bond broker
involved in a criminal case.
   He said he was reading ``Evening News,'' by Arthur Hailey,
Robert Caro's biography of former President Lyndon Johnson, a
couple of books on Theodore Roosevelt and a mystery ``May Day Man''
by William Beecher.
   Bush said he likes to do ``a relaxed kind of reading'' before
going to sleep ``instead of taking one of those ... Halcion
sleeping tablets _ a good novel will help.''
   Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said, ``No,'' when
asked if the president had ever ingested the drug.
   Bush said a lot of his reading is from the CIA which has
``marvelous studies of things all around the world.''

   A protester who was just evicted from her
campsite at the motel where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was
killed faced a new threat Tuesday: a summons for blocking the
sidewalk at her new protest camp.
   Jacqueline Smith had camped in front The Lorraine Motel for more
than two years _ ever since deputies evicted her from the motel
itself _ to protest the construction of a civil rights museum there.
   Ms. Smith pitched her tent on the other side of the street after
sheriff's deputies acting on a court order carried her from the
original campsite Monday.
   She had hardly settled in, however, before city police handed
her a summons for blocking the sidewalk.
   She was scheduled to appear in court Sept. 5, and a police
commander said the city would order her to move if she is convicted.
   ``I intend to remain right here,'' said Ms. Smith, 39, a former
motel employee who wants a homeless shelter or medical clinic built
on the site.
   Much of the small, downtown motel has already been demolished to
make way for the National Civil Rights Center, which is to open
next year.
   The wing where the civil rights leader was shot to death on
April 4, 1968 is being restored and will serve as the museum's
centerpiece.
   Inspector David Dugger, commander of the neighborhood's police
precinct, said Ms. Smith is charged with blocking a sidewalk with
her tent and other belongings.
   ``We'll leave her there until such time as she has her day in
court,'' he said.
   Ms. Smith's first camp was on state property, but she moved onto
city land Monday after her eviction, Dugger said.
   The court order to evict was issued last week after the
construction company said Ms. Smith was in the way.
   The Lorraine was in disrepair when when it was sold at a
foreclosure auction in 1982.
   It took another several years for the citizens group that bought
it to persuade the state, county and city governments to build the
museum.

<HEAD>Serbian Leader Closes Founding Socialist Party Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic on
Tuesday closed the founding congress of the republic's Socialist
Party with a pledge that the renamed Communists would not veer from
their political objectives.
   In a bid to discard their conservative image, Serbia's ruling
Communists merged with a sister organization and renamed themselves
the Socialist Party.
   Milosevic, who also is Serbia's president, was elected leader of
the new party. It seeks to unite all left-wing groups in the
largest Yugoslav republic.
   ``The left should not fear that this party will swing toward the
right, while the right should not hope that this party will come
closer to them,'' Milosevic said.
   In the weeks preceding the merger between the Communist party
and the republic's Socialist Alliance, a Communist-run mass
movement, Serbia's still illegal opposition denounced the move as a
sham designed to keep the Communists in power as long as possible.
   The growing opposition, which has demanded free elections in the
republic, says the merger gave the Communists control of the
Socialist Alliance's substantial assets and media it currently
controls.
   Two Serbian opposition groups, in another show of dissent, on
Tuesday scheduled a memorial Mass throughout the republic for Gen.
Draza Mihajlovic, a former leader of royalist Chetnik guerillas who
fought Communist partisans in World War II.
   About 2,000 anti-Communists hailed Serbian Chetnik Movement
president Vojislav Seselj, who praised the general as a ``hero and
martyr,'' and denounced the Serbian Communist regime.
   The rally also cheered Mirko Jovic, the leader of the Serbian
Renewal Movement, another nationalist party, and sang Serbian
nationalist songs.
   Police tried on two occasions to stop the rally on grounds that
it was not officially approved, but the gathering ended without
incident.
   Mihajlovic, depicted by the victorious Communists as a war
criminal, was executed after a brief trial on July 17, 1946.
   Notices printed by the newly-formed Chetnik party and calling
for Serbs to attend the church commemorations and a rally in
downtown Belgrade were torn down by police, newspaper reports said.
   Croatia and Slovenia, Yugoslavia's two westward-leaning states,
earlier this year held the first free elections in the country in
45 years. Both ballots were won by center-right parties.
   The founding congress was marked by infighting among delegates
over who should be included in the Socialist Party's new 111-member
ruling council. Several speakers complained that most of the
proposed members were in the Communist Party leadership.
   Milosevic gained popularity in Serbia for virtually abolishing
the autonomy of the republic's Kosovo province, where ethnic
Albanians make up a majority of the people.
   Earlier this month, Serbia disbanded Kosovo's Parliament after
114 ethnic Albanian deputies announced plans to declare Kosovo's
independence from Serbia.

   A mentally retarded man was sentenced
to death Tuesday for a second time for raping and fatally stabbing
a young woman in 1979.
   Jurors deliberated for about 2{ hours before deciding Johnny
Paul Penry, 34, should be executed for the death of Pamela
Carpenter, 22, the sister of former National Football League kicker
Mark Moseley of the Washington Redskins.
   The state District Court jury, which last week convicted Penry
of capital murder, could have sentenced Penry to life in prison or
death by injection.
   Penry showed no emotion when the verdict was announced.
   ``He asked me what the verdict was,'' said defense attorney John
Wright. ``I think he did not understand.''
   Wright and fellow defense attorney Robert Smith said they would
appeal.
   Mrs. Carpenter's mother, Rossie Moseley, expressed relief at the
verdict.
   ``This can't bring Pam back. But really, I think he deserves the
punishment,'' she said.
   District Attorney Joe Price said he was hopeful all along of a
death sentence, but feared questions about Penry's mental
retardation would hamper the jury.
   ``I was delightfully surprised,'' Price said. ``They didn't get
confused over the judge's instructions.''
   In final arguments, Smith urged jurors to sentence Penry to life
in prison.
   ``He deserves very severe punishment,'' Smith said, standing
behind Penry with his hands on his client's shoulders. ``It is
right to punish him. It is wrong to kill him.''
   ``If there's anybody in this room who believes in the death
penalty, it's Johnny Paul Penry, because he inflicted it,'' said
Polk County District Attorney Joe Price. ``He's got no internal
controls, no remorse, no conscience. He's dangerous.''
   Tests have shown Penry has an IQ of about 60 and the reasoning
capacity of a 7-year-old.
   Penry has been on death row since 1980, when he was convicted
and sentenced to die for Mrs. Carpenter's slaying.
   In 1986, he came within hours of lethal injection before getting
a stay.
   The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld the
constitutionality of executing retarded killers. But the court
vacated Penry's sentence, agreeing with defense attorneys that the
jury should have been told of Penry's retardation.
   In his charge to the jury Tuesday, State District Judge Joe Ned
Dean pointed out they must weigh mitigating circumstances.
   Mrs. Carpenter was stabbed repeatedly in the chest with a pair
of scissors she was using to make a Halloween costume for her
niece. She described her killer to police before dying in a
hospital emergency room.
   Penry, who confessed to the slaying, had been on parole for
about three months after serving two years of a five-year term for
rape.

<TEXT>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee voted
Tuesday to limit defense spending next year to $294.9 billion, $8.4
billion less than President Bush wants.
   The 24-4 bipartisan vote was only the most recent indication
that in light of improving relations with the East, Congress
intends to give the Pentagon less than the White House thinks is
right.
   All 15 voting committee Democrats and nine of its 13 Republicans
voted for the $294.9 billion figure.
   Both Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the
Appropriations defense subcommittee, and the subcommittee's ranking
Republican, Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska, complained that the defense
figure was too low.
   But Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
whose panel also adopted limits on spending for domestic and
foreign aid programs, said the deficit was putting pressure on all
programs.
   ``Tough choices will be necessary for all subcommittees,'' Byrd
said.
   The figure the appropriations panel approved is halfway between
the defense spending totals that have been approved by two rival
Senate committees.
   The Senate Budget Committee, headed by Sen. James Sasser,
D-Tenn., a negotiator at the budget talks between Congress and the
White House, would cut military spending to $293.4 billion.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee, whose chairman is the
influential Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., has voted for a level of $296.4
billion.
   The figure adopted by the Appropriations Committee is the
starting point from which the panel's members will craft military
spending legislation for fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1.
   The number could change, however, if budget negotiators work out
a deal. Their talks have been under way for more than two months.
   Meanwhile in the House, the chairman of the Armed Services
Committee and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., reached a
tentative agreement on Tuesday for the panel to begin crafting a
fiscal 1991 defense bill later this month.
   Committee action on the bill was not expected until September,
but the panel's subcommittees will likely start work on the
legislation the week of July 23, said the committee's ranking
Republican, Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama.
   Unlike the Senate Armed Services Committee, which crafted a bill
based on its chairman's total of $289 billion, the House panel will
draw up legislation based on the lower House-approved budget of
$283 billion, $24 billion less than requested by Bush. It faces
opposition from Republicans and conservative Democrats.
   ``It's going to be horrendous, gut-wrenching,'' Dickinson said.

<TEXT>
   James H. Meredith, a civil rights pioneer
who now works for Sen. Jesse Helms, contended Tuesday that a cadre
of white men control American blacks and their leaders.
   Meredith made the allegation when asked about a charge he made
Monday that many of the delegates to last week's NAACP convention
are ``involved in the drug culture.''
   Helms, R-N.C., is running for re-election against Democrat
Harvey Gantt, a black who was mayor of Charlotte. Helms said he did
not approve in advance the statement Meredith issued Monday on
Helms' stationery, but said he generally agreed with it.
   When informed of Meredith's comments, Gantt said, ``I don't know
what the heck he's talking about.''
   Meredith, who in 1962 was the first black to enter the
University of Mississippi, was active early in the civil-rights
movement. But he soon fell out with such mainstream organizations
as the NAACP and has been a harsh critic of the civil-rights
establishment.
   He argues that the laws those groups advocate just reinforce the
concept that blacks are inferior to other Americans.
   In the news release, Meredith said had background profiles on
more than half of the 3,000 delegates to the NAACP convention in
Los Angeles, ``and over 60 percent are involved in the drug culture
and at least 80 percent are involved in criminal or immoral
activities.'' He said Tuesday he stood by the allegation.
   Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, responded by calling
Meredith ``an intellectual vagrant _ lacking any visible means of
support.''
   ``We call on Sen. Jesse Helms ... to disavow this statement and
to take appropriate disciplinary action against Mr. Meredith,''
Hooks said in a statement issued in Baltimore. ``It would serve no
useful purpose to address such ludicrous accusations from one who
has obviously lost touch with reality.''
   Meredith maintained all high-level black government officials
owe their positions to the purported group of 15 whites. That
includes, he said, ``the chairman of the Democratic party, the
mayor of any city, city councilmen in most cases in the big cities,
any high-level position in city government.''
   He said he knew the names of the 15 men, but refused to divulge
them.
   Helms, who hired Meredith as a special assistant last year at a
salary of about $30,000 a year, defended his aide.
   ``It is his right to express his opinion and I would think the
press would respect that _ even if he does not espouse the liberal
ideas the press supports,'' Helms said. ``The press in North
Carolina seems bent on injecting race into this campaign, rather
than fairly reporting the facts.''
   Meredith also said that blacks had more control over their lives
during slavery than they do now. ``Until 25 years ago, the black
race had control of all their domestic affairs,'' he said.
   And he accused black leaders, especially leaders of the NAACP
and the Democratic Party, of not caring.
   ``I bet you there were not 10 people in that convention who
lived near the black community,'' he said. ``Three thousand people
don't have the right to sell the interest of 30 million people.
   Meredith said his prime sources of information on the NAACP's
leaders were ``people who were there,'' and said he has a
nationwide network of connections.
   He added that this activity was not part of his official duties.
   The news release dated July 14 was mailed to North Carolina
reporters at Senate expense.
   It said, ``According to reports in The Washington Post, the
3,000 delegates at the NAACP's 81st National Convention `were
unanimous' in agreeing that black officials are being harassed by
government prosecutors. Why are they taking this stand?''
   ``I think we need to look into the backgrounds of these
so-called leaders,'' Meredith said.
   He called upon the NAACP's Hooks and two other black leaders _
Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron Brown and National Urban
League head John Jacobs _ to reveal whether they'd ever taken drugs
and to discuss their ``moral standards.''
   Jenny Terzano, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National
Committee, said Monday that Brown ``will submit to a drug test any
day of the week if James Meredith submits to an IQ test.''
   Calls to Jacobs seeking comment Tuesday were not immediately
returned.

<TEXT>
   State employees will recycle more than 2
million foam coffee cups a year under a program announced Tuesday
by Gov. James Blanchard.
   ``This is really a milestone in recycling,'' Blanchard said at a
news conference. ``It is not only good for state government, it's
good for the state and it will set an example for other states.''
   He described the program, sponsored by Dart Container Corp., as
the largest polystyrene recycling effort in the nation.
   Blanchard and William A. Dart, the company's chairman, showed
reporters the Mason plant where the foam containers will be turned
into pellets, eventually to be sold and recycled as containers,
coat hangers, toys and desk equipment.
   ``It proves how much we can accomplish when we work together,''
Dart said. ``There has to be a public interest in it to make it
work.''
   About 230 state employees will volunteer to help collect more
than 2.1 million cups bought each year for use in 80 state office
buildings in the Lansing area. The plant is about 10 miles south of
Lansing.
   The program, which won't use taxpayers' money, will be expanded
later this year to include state offices elsewhere.
   The company already has a plant in Ontario, Canada, and will be
able to recycle more than 10 million pounds of polystyrene a year
after it expands its center in Mason and opens new recycling
centers soon in Leola, Pa., and Plant City, Fla.
   Michigan state offices already recycle paper and by October are
projected to have collected more than 6 million pounds this year.

<DATELINE>BAGUIO, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of residents of this
devastated city endured severe food, water and power shortages on
Tuesday, a day after a major earthquake nearly isolated this luxury
mountain resort from the outside world.
   The quake, which measured 7.7 on the Richter scale, killed 82
people here and more than 195 elsewhere in the Philippines. Most of
the Baguio casualties died in the rubble of four luxury hotels and
23 other buildings that were severely damaged. Hundreds more are
believed still trapped in debris.
   President Corazon Aquino flew to Baguio early Wednesday to
inspect the damage.
   ``I never thought in my entire life that I could see such
destruction,'' said Ed Pangilinan, a spokesman for the Defense
Department who accompanied Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos to the
city 110 miles north of Manila.
   He said townspeople lined the streets begging for food as Ramos'
party drove past. Philippine television stations reported
widespread looting in the city Wednesday.
   Baguio was the town most heavily damaged by the earthquake,
which left at least 279 dead.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said about 1,500
Americans live in Baguio but there were no reports of deaths or
injuries among them.
   The city's two funeral parlors have more business than they can
handle and have refused to accept more dead. During his Tuesday
tour, Ramos said he would ask for preservatives to be flown into
the city so the dead could be safely stored until they can be
properly buried.
   Tuesday, Rep. Raul Roco, assistant House majority leader, stood
helpless outside the Nevada Hotel, which was ripped in half by the
quake, shouting to his wife who was trapped inside.
   A frustrated Roco urged cadets of the Philippine Military
Academy, located here, to help him rescue his wife.
   ``Sir, we want to help you but what can we do? How can we, with
our bare hands?'' one cadet replied.
   The isolation of this mountain town, which helped make it a
favorite resort among Filipinos seeking to escape the summer heat,
hampered rescue effforts.
   Monday's quake closed the airport, knocked out telephone, water
and electricity services and buried the access roads under tons of
mud and stone.
   The military said it was unable to bring cranes, tractors and
other heavy equipment to the city because of the landslides. The
landslides also trapped hundreds of people in passenger buses,
trucks and private cars.
   Food and fuel supplies in the city were reportedly running low.
Col. Bienvenido Liclican, spokesman for the military rescue team,
said the search for survivors has to be suspended at night because
there is no electricity to power searchlights.
   Officials said it may take up to six months to clear the main
highway linking Baguio with the rest of the country.
   Commercial life in this city of 120,000 has all but ceased. Most
stores are closed, and residents are running out of food. One
grocery store opened Tuesday but quickly shut its doors after
setting off a stampede.
   Only one of the eight service stations is operating, and
motorists must line up to buy the $4.50 of gas that rationing
permits them.
   Since the quake struck thousands have been living in their cars
or camping out in the city's park, fearful of returning to their
homes.
   A U.S. Air Force engineering team joined the search for up to
1,000 people believed trapped in the rubble of 27 buildings.
   The damaged buildings included four luxury hotels that cracked
under the force of the quake. The entire front section of the Hyatt
Terraces Baguio, which featured a floor-to-roof inner atrium,
tumbled down on the lobby area, trapping an estimated 150 people.

<HEAD>Indian Leaders Called to Meeting over Mohawk-Quebec Standoff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKA, Quebec (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 250 Indian chiefs from across
Canada were called into emergency session Tuesday to plan strategy
in a land dispute case that has led to an armed standoff between
Mohawks and Quebec police.
   One police officer has been killed, though responsibility in
that death has yet to be fixed. Area residents have asked for
military intervention, and the Montreal La Presse said possible
vigilante action was being plotted.
   The paper said Tuesday that members of a citizens' movement,
supported by some local business people, were ready to take action
themselves if the Mercier Bridge into nearby Montreal stays
blocked. A reporter was shown weapons stockpiled by the group.
   Mohawks from the Kahnawake reserve have blockaded the bridge for
a week in support of the Oka Indians.
   As a result, people in the suburb of Chateauguay have had to
spend an extra two hours a day traveling to and from work.
Anti-native demonstrations have taken place at police cordons near
the bridge, including the nightly burning of a Mohawk in effigy.
   The dispute stems from plans by Oka, a town 18 miles west of
Montreal, to build a golf course addition on what the Mohawks say
is ancestral land. Quebec police last Wednesday tried to tear down
an Indian blockade and an officer was killed during a brief
gunfight.
   Arrangements were made to ferry the convening Indian chiefs
across the St. Lawrence River to the Kahnawake reserve Tuesday to
avoid police roadblocks.
   Joe Norton, band council chief at Kahnawake reserve who invited
the chiefs, said, ``I hope this will kick the federal government in
the pants and get them moving ... to do something positive.''
   Oka was quiet Tuesday. Quebec's native affairs minister, John
Ciaccia, was expected to return for negotiations but did not arrive.
   The Mohawks announced late Tuesday they have called in lawyers
who specialize in native affairs to help with negotiations.
   An Indian statement said William Kunstler of New York, a human
rights lawyer and constitutional expert, and Stanley Cohen, a New
York civil rights lawyer, will also join the Oka Mohawks.
   Kunstler, who has represented Indian groups in the United
States, arrived at the Mohawk barricade in Oka Tuesday night. He
said he waited 10 hours on a bus before being cleared for entry by
Quebec police.
   On Tuesday, a Red Cross medical team went behind Indian lines at
Oka to evaluate the health of seniors, pregnant women, children and
the sick.
   A convoy of Red Cross supplies of food and medicine was also
allowed onto the Mohawk-controlled territory.
   Canadian Forces soldiers and equipment were moved to Longue
Pointe military base in Montreal on standby in the stalemate.
   An armed forces officer who visited the base told the Montreal
Gazette on Monday he saw convoys of military trucks, armed
personnel carriers, communications vehicles and anti-tank weapons.
   Capt. Alain Lefrancois, Quebec public affairs officer for the
Department of National Defense, said Tuesday soldiers would not
intervene unless asked to do so by the provincial government.
   Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers from across Canada also
moved into the area to act as reserves for Quebec police in case
fighting flares up again.

   A Nicaraguan diplomat who allegedly recruited
other embassy workers to smuggle heroin-filled suitcases into the
United States and Australia was arrested in Tokyo on Tuesday,
authorities said.
   William Tapia, recently promoted to the No. 2 position in the
Nicaraguan Embassy in Tokyo, was charged in a federal indictment
unsealed Tuesday with conspiring to smuggle heroin worth up to $21
million from Thailand to New York.
   He was dismissed from his job by the Nicaraguan government and
arrested by Japanese authorities, acting on a warrant issued in
Brooklyn, said U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney.
   In Managua, the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry said it had stripped
Tapia of his diplomatic immunity at the request of the U.S. and
Japanese governments so that he could be arrested.
   Tapia, 47, will be extradited to New York within 45 days to
stand trial, Maloney said.
   Tapia worked since at least 1986 with two prominent Hong Kong
dealers to smuggle heroin to New York and Sydney, Australia, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Cathy Palmer.
   The indictment, filed Feb. 6 in New York after an 18-month
investigation, charges Tapia arranged two trips in 1987 for a
Guatemalan diplomat, Jorge Rueda, to smuggle a total of 125 pounds
of ``China White'' heroin to New York.
   Tapia received between $300,000 and $400,000 per trip for
recruiting the diplomats. He is suspected of arranging at least
four more trips, Maloney said.
   All of the diplomats recruited were from Central or South
American countries and stationed in Tokyo, he said.
   Rueda was arrested in Australia in April 1988 on heroin
importation charges and subsequently convicted.
   A Foreign Ministry official in Japan, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Tapia first came to Japan as the embassy's cultural
attache in 1968. He resigned in 1979 but rejoined the embassy as
first secretary in June 1986 and was recently promoted to
counselor, the official said.
   Palmer said Tapia's arrest may not significantly affect the
amount of heroin on the streets in New York, but that it would make
it harder for Hong Kong drug lords to bring it in.
   ``It takes out a very secure method for smuggling _ using
diplomats,'' she said. ``They are subject to almost no scrutiny
upon arrival.''
   U.S. Customs agents normally do not inspect the luggage of
diplomats because of their status, Maloney said.
   Tapia faces at least 10 years and up to life in prison if
convicted of all charges.
   The investigation is continuing and more arrests were possible,
Palmer said. Also involved are the federal multi-agency Southeast
Asian Heroin Task Force and authorities in Hong Kong, Australia and
Japan.

   American makers of new type display screens
for use in electronic gear of the future accused major Japanese
competitors Tuesday of unfair price-cutting on U.S. sales.
   A petition filed by the Advanced Display Manufacturers of
America asked the government to order penalty duties as high as 318
percent on Japanese imports that it said violate this country's
anti-dumping laws.
   Dumping is selling at less than production costs or home market
prices to capture an unfair share of a market.
   The petition filed with the U.S. Commerce Department named 12
Japanese electronic companies, including Sharp Corp., Matsushita
Electrical Industrial Co. and Hitachi Ltd. Those three were
identified as the major suppliers to the United States, with a
total of 38.5 percent of the U.S. market in recent years.
   Japanese imports have captured 90 percent of the fast-growing,
multimillion-dollar American market for flat panel display screens,
a technology originated in this country, the petition claimed. The
other firms named were Toshiba Corp., Fujitsu Ltd., Hoshiden
Electronics Co., Kyocera Corp., Matsuhita Electronics Corp., NEC
Corp., Optrex Corp., Seiko Epson Corp. and Seiko Indstruments and
Electronics Ltd.
   The American manufacturers said the petition would also be filed
with the U.S. International Trade Commission. The two agencies may
decide to hold public hearings in a procedure that lasts about a
year before the final decision on whether to charge penalty duties.
   Flat panel display screens are replacing the larger conventional
cathode ray tubes that now form the screens of television
receivers, word processors, and computers, aircraft control panels,
medical imaging devices and other equipment. The technology would
be incorporated in high-definition television.
   Members of American manufacturers association include Planar
Systems, Plasmasco Inc., Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc., The Cherry
Corp., Electro-Plasma Inc., Photonics Technology Inc. and
Magnascreen Corp.

   Inspections by the Food and Drug
Administration of the top 13 laboratories that conduct a key test
on generic drugs found problems at two, an agency spokesman said
Tuesday.
   The problems were most severe at Biodecision Laboratories in
Pittsburgh, where all but two of 13 studies reviewed by the
inspectors violated FDA regulations or fell short of accepted
laboratory practice, said FDA spokesman Don McLearn.
   Problems were also found at the University of Tennessee College
of Pharmacy in Memphis, McLearn said. He said he did not know the
specific problems there, but he said ``they're minimal ... they're
clearly not to the degree as the one in Pittsburgh.''
   The inspections at the 13 labs, which conduct 95 percent of the
bioequivalency studies done on generic drugs, were conducted as
part of a follow-up to disclosures of fraud and corruption in the
generic drug industry last year. Eleven of the labs ``had no
problems,'' McLearn said.
   Bioequivalency testing is aimed at showing that a candidate
generic drug reaches the same concentration in the bloodstream as
the patented drug for which it would be sold as a substitute after
the patent expires.
   The inspection at Biodecision was conducted also as a follow-up
to ``anonymous allegations of wrongdoing,'' according to the FDA
inspection report. The document said ``allegations of poor science
were found to be supportable. Evidence of fraud, conspiracy and
conflict of interest was not.''
   However, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee, wants the FDA to
conduct more intensive examinations of the studies done by these
labs on generic drugs that were approved based on those studies.
   Dingell, in a letter Monday, also asked Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan to instruct the FDA to come up
with a plan by Aug. 8 to determine the validity of the Biodecision
studies.
   Biodecision has conducted 20 percent to 30 percent of the
bioequivalency studies that have resulted in approved generic
drugs, Dingell said.
   ``Given the impact on the generic industry from corruption found
to date, this latest revelation (concerning Biodecision) of
impropriety is truly calamitous,'' Dingell said.
   McLearn said the FDA has not responded to Dingell's request for
more investigation of Biodecision's studies or his request for more
intensive investigations at the other testing labs.
   Dingell said that since the Biodecision inspection was triggered
by fraud allegations, he doubted the inspections at the other labs
were as intense.
   McLearn said Biodecision promised to correct the flaws.
   Company president Robert Lecher did not return a telephone for
comment on Tuesday, but he was quoted by The Washington Post as
saying, ``We view the entire process as very constructive and have
taken it extremely seriously. We don't take issue or disagree with
any of the observations.''
   In Memphis, Gil Hayes, a spokesman for the College of Pharmacy,
said: ``We have no information as to what the nature of the
deficiency might be. We'll investigate that ... We feel quite
confident that our College of Pharmacy has performed an exemplary
service over many years.''

<HEAD>South African Zulu Leader Criticizes ANC, Economic Sanctions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of South Africa's Zulus on Tuesday
denounced the African National Congress refusal to reject violence
and reiterated his opposition to economic sanctions against South
Africa.
   Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, whose Inkatha movement is the ANC's
chief rival, also said the ANC was seeking political gain through
confrontation.
   He warned that unless other predominantly black groups were
included in constitutional negotiations with the white-led
government, the ANC would have a stranglehold on black
representation.
   ``South African revolutionaries, like revolutionaries
everywhere, do not fight revolutions to enable other political
parties to gain power,'' Buthelezi said in an address to the Center
for Policy Studies.
   The center is a right-wing think tank that advises Britain's
Conservative government. Buthelezi arrived in Britain Monday on a
mainly private visit.
   ``(The ANC) is entirely wrong when it calls for continuation of
the armed struggle; calls for the continued employment of economic
sanctions against South Africa; calls for the general punitive
isolation of South Africa in every way possible,'' he said.
   Inkatha, which claims 1.5 million members, announced over the
weekend it had become a multiracial political party.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is the most outspoken
advocate of easing sanctions against South Africa to reward
President F.W. de Klerk for his reforms and his pledge to end
apartheid.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which
South Africa's 30 million blacks have no vote in national afairs.
The country's 5 million whites dominate politics and the economy.
   Nelson Mandela, the ANC deputy president released in February
after 27 years in jail, says economic sanctions should remain until
South Africa's black majority is enfranchised under a new
constitution.
   The 12-nation European Community last month refused to lift its
relatively mild embargoes, saying it needed further evidence that
reforms were continuing.
   British Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave, who was in
the audience Tuesdsay, said South Africa's public services for
blacks were ``woefully inadequate'' for such a wealthy country.

   A 17-year-old who allegedly hijacked a Soviet
jetliner to Sweden last month was extradited Tuesday to the Soviet
Union, state media reported.
   ``Several rides in a Volvo and tasty lunches are not worth the
punishment I will receive under Soviet law,'' a handcuffed Dmitry
Semenov said to television reporters as he was put into a police
car after returning to Moscow. Semenov was presumably referring to
rides he had gotten in the Swedish-made Volvo automobile while in
custody of Swedish authorities.
   Airline hijackings carry a penalty of 5 to 20 years in jail in
the Soviet Union. Because Semenov is under 18, he faces a maximum
of 10 years, according to Swedish Foreign Ministry spokesman Bo
Heineback.
urn was shown on the Soviet TV news program
``Vremya,'' and an account also was carried by the official Soviet
news agency Tas   Semenov's rets.
   Earlier Tuesday, accused Soviet hijacker Oleg Kozlov, 20,
appeared in a Finnish court for the first time since he took over a
Soviet domestic airliner June 19 and forced it to land at
Helsinki's airport.
   Finnish Justice Minister Tarja Halonen was expected to decide
this week whether to extradite Kozlov. The Supreme Court said last
week there were no legal obstacles to his extradition.
   Soviet media have reported 11 airline hijackings this summer,
with sison became religious in 1983 and threw away
his collection of rock albums, but later resumed listening to the
music.
   ``He couldn't do both at the same time,'' Mrs. Vance said. ``He
was either true to the God of our church, or he was true to the god
Judas Priest.''
   Under cross examination, she said both she and her husband were
heavy drinkers and had ``whipped'' James as a child. Her husband
was also a compulsive gambler, she said.
   After the suicide attempt, James beat her up twice, once
breaking her nose, Mrs. Vance testified.
   District Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead is hearing the case without
a jury.

   Brandon Tartikoff, who as programs chief
helped make NBC first in evening ratings for five seasons, was
appointed Tuesday to head a new division that will try to find
markets for network-produced shows.
   Tartikoff's duties will include devising programming ideas for
NBC's in-house production company and overseeing the network's
development think tank of executives for sports, prime time,
daytime and late-night programs.
   The Tartikoff switch was announced Tuesday as part of a
high-level reorganization of the network.
   Replacing Tartikoff as NBC entertainment president will be
Warren Littlefield, whose post as executive vice president of prime
time programs will be assumed by Perry Simon, the department's
senior vice president.
   John Agoglia, executive vice president of NBC productions, also
will now head the recently formed NBC Enterprises, which handles
international distribution and other efforts by the network to
diversify its business holdings.
   Tartikoff's admittedly ill-defined new job will consist of being
the ``grand architect'' of NBC's ``big picture,'' he said.
   The 41-year-old executive took over NBC's prime time schedule 10
years ago and was hailed for pushing it out of last place into
first for the last five seasons.
   His new post was created to breathe life into NBC's leading but
aging programming and to hold onto executives such as Littlefield,
whose contract expires next month.
   In an interview Tuesday, Littlefield said he asked for
Tartikoff's job and got it.
   ``Brandon said he didn't want to sit in on these (prime time)

Littlefield said.
   ``Brandon was great about it,'' Littlefield said. ``This gives
him more time to run NBC Productions and the development group.''
   The NBC network currently serves more than 200 affiliates. NBC's
announcement didn't specify what kinds of new outlets Tartikoff
will seek for NBC-made productions.
   But the company is active in cable as a co-owner of CNBC and
SportsChannel America.
   It also is a partner with three other companies in Sky Cable, a
direct broadcast satellite program service scheduled to begin
operations in late 1993.

<HEAD>Social Democrat Lafontaine Makes Campaign Appearance in East
Berlin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German politician Oskar Lafontaine, who
says German unification is going too fast, used an East Berlin
campaign appearance Tuesday to say the once-divided city deserved
its place as a ``central European metropolis.''
   He did not say what he thought about Berlin's becoming the
capital of a united Germany, as most other East and West German
politicians have suggested.
   Lafontaine only recently recovered from an attempt on his life.
A disturbed woman stabbed him in the neck during the April party
conference that nominated him for chancellor and he was rushed to a
hospital in serious condition.
   His assailant was committed to a mental asylum.
   Social Democrat Lafontaine is Chancellor Helmut Kohl's main
rival in general elections scheduled in West Germany for Dec. 2.
   The 42-year-old prime minister of West Germany's Saarland region
has repeatedly criticized Kohl, a Christian Democrat, for
proceeding too quickly with German unification.
   But Lafontaine could end up playing a major role in joint
East-West German elections. Those elections, expected also on Dec.
2, probably will lead to formal unity that month.
   During his daylong East Berlin visit, Lafontaine said he would
play an active role in the campaign for next October's elections in
the five soon-to-be-established East German regions that are to
make up the eastern part of a united Germany.

   American relief organizations worked Tuesday to rush aid to the
quake-battered Philippines as anxious relatives in the United
States tried to find out if loved ones were among the dead or
injured.
   ``Everywhere, people are saying they have relatives who are
missing. It's all confusion,'' said Lindy Batara, of Fremont,
Calif., executive secretary of the Ilocano National Association, an
ethnic Filipino organization.
   Monday's earthquake, which registered 7.7 on the Richter scale
and was centered about 70 miles north of Manila, left 283 dead,
hundreds injured and thousands homeless, officials said.
   The Aloha Medical Mission, a Hawaii organization that sends
physicians to the Philippines every year, planned to send medical
supplies Tuesday night aboard a Philippine Airlines jet, said Pedro
Chan, acting chief officer for the Philippine Consulate in Honolulu.
   Chan said the consulate had received some cash and clothing for
earthquake victims. But he encouraged people to donate money to the
Red Cross, which has set up a relief fund.
   Chan said the consulate was receiving calls about every 10
minutes from anxious Filipinos with relatives in the devastated
area.
   ``Unfortunately, we don't have the names,'' Chan said.
   The AmeriCares relief organization in New Caanan, Conn., had
supplies and volunteers in the Philippines before the quake,
spokesman Steve Norman said.
   ``If a disaster had to occur in a place where we had to get to
quickly, the Philippines was an ideal place,'' Norman said,
explaining that the group had been working for some time there with
the Knights of Malta, a Roman Catholic humanitarian group.
   An AmeriCares plane carrying medical supplies was to leave from
Memphis, Tenn., early Wednesday, Norman said.
   The organization recently sent supplies to Iran after the
devastating earthquake that reportedly killed 40,000 people.
   Norman said donations have been generous, but said people may be
``tapped out'' due to other recent disasters.
   Phone lines to the Philippines were jammed Monday by an
unusually large number of calls, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
spokesman Randy Shields said in San Francisco. The company,
following its policy in disasters, allowed more calls going out of
the Philippines than coming in, Shields said.
   ``As each hour passes, it ought to be easier to get in,'' he
said.
   In the San Francisco Bay area, where an estimated 400,000
Filipino-Americans live, the Ilocano National Association collected
at least $14,000, Batara said.
   The Philippine Assistance for Technology &amp; Health in Berkeley,
Calif., and the Philippine Consulate also set up relief funds.

<HEAD>Venezuela Orders Three Former Top Government Officials Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court ordered the arrests Tuesday of
three former top government officials on corruption charges after
they were accused of stealing $337,000 seized from alleged drug
runners.
   The Public Service Court issued arrest warrants for former
Interior Minister Jose Angel Ciliberto, ex-national intelligence
director Porfirio Antonio Valera and former intelligence
investigations director Juan Oswaldo Granadillos, the government
news agency Venpres said.
   Ciliberto is believed to have fled the country after an arrest
warrant was issued last week for him in a different case. The
government did not say whether Valera or Ganadillos were in custody.
   All three served under former President Jaime Lusinchi, whose
term ended in February.
   The three are accused of embezzlement stemming from a 1985 case
in which $337,000 disappeared while in the care of the intelligence
police.
   The money was seized from two Puerto Rican brothers who were
arrested at Caracas's Simon Bolivar airport and accused of drug
trafficking. They remain in jail.
   The warrants are the latest in a series of corruption charges
made by the government of President Carlos Andres Perez.
   Warrants were issued for Ciliberto and for 11 other prominent
figures by the same court last week, after the officials were
accused of using state security funds to buy cars for pleasure and
for an electoral campaign.

   Authorities Tuesday arrested at least 17
people accused of being part of a 16-state cocaine and marijuana
ring, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration official said.
   ``We feel confident we have pretty much immobilized an entire
organization,'' said Gerard Murphy, the top DEA agent in Arizona.
   Another two of the 40 people indicted in the case were in
Mexican jails, Murphy said. Twenty-one remained at large.
   Law enforcement officers also seized $1 million in cash, cars
and other assets, he said.
   Since 1984, the southern Arizona-based ring has distributed
1,000 kilograms of cocaine, 305 tons of marijuana and 1 million
methaqualone tablets around the country, Murphy said. He could not
estimate the value of the drugs.
   The ring was headed by Michael Hooks, who has been in a Mexico
City prison on Mexican charges since June 1987, the agent alleged.
Murphy declined to release any other information about Hooks.
   Authorities arrested seven people in Tucson and one each in San
Francisco, Mobile and Birmingham, Ala.; Nashville, Tenn., and Grand
Rapids, Mich., Murphy said. Three other suspects were already in
prisons in California and another was in Douglas, Ariz.
   Mexican officials have been asked to transfer Hooks to American
custody, he said.
   Suspects were also being sought in Florida, Illinois, Oklahoma,
Texas, and Arkansas, Murphy said. The ring also operated in
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and North
Carolina.
   The DEA began its investigation after a plane crashed in 1985
near San Manuel, about 40 miles northeast of Tucson, Murphy said.
The U.S. Customs Service, the Internal Revenue Service and the
Arizona Department of Public Safety also took part in the probe.
   A 1986 raid in Tucson turned up 16 kilograms of cocaine and
detailed drug ledgers containing ``staggering'' numbers, he said.
   The investigation earlier led to the indictment of Mexican
marijuana trafficker Rafael Caro-Quintero on charges he operated a
continuing criminal enterprise, Murphy said.
   Caro-Quintero, serving a sentence in Mexico City for his role in
the kidnapping and torture murder of DEA agent Enrique Camarena,
has been identified as one of the Hooks' organization's main
suppliers of marijuana, Murphy added.
   The cocaine source has been narrowed to Medillin, Colombia, he
said.
   The ring flew and dropped off all but two drug loads at
clandestine Arizona airstrips for storage and subsequent
distribution, he said.
   Murphy said the charges in the indictment returned June 28 by a
federal grand jury in Tucson involved actions in 1985 and 1986.
   The indictments were the fourth set the grand jury has issued
concerning the Hooks organization since June 1986, he said. In all,
the grand jury has named 96 defendants and panels in Minnesota and
Alabama have named another 14.
   Twenty-five of the 70 indicted previously remain fugitives, and
all but one of the remaining 45 have been convicted.

   Security forces opened
fire on rock-throwing protestors Tuesday in the provincial city of
Bonao. It was the second day of protests against President Joaquin
Balaguer's narrow election victory.
   One woman was wounded when a bullet struck her in the head,
police said.
   Large-scale demonstrations also occurred in the three northern
cities of Santiago, Nagua and San Francisco de Macoris, but no
injuries were reported, police said.
   No disturbances were reported in Santo Domingo, the capital of
2.2 million people on the southern coast. However, the state
university was closed because of clashes on Monday between police
and students.
   Witnesses said the injured woman was wounded when police and
soldiers opened fire on protesters who were throwing rocks at
vehicles and shops in Bonao. Protesters also burned tires and set
up roadblocks, according to police.
   Two protesters were wounded by police gunfire in separate
clashes Monday in San Francisco de Macoris and the western city of
Azua.
   The demonstrations were part of a 48-hour period of ``national
mourning'' organized by Juan Bosch's Dominican Liberation Party to
protest his defeat by Balaguer in the May 16 election.
   Bosch, 81, a former leftist president ousted by a military coup
in 1963, accused the conservative Balaguer of widespread election
fraud.
   Balaguer won the election with a victory margin of less than 2
percent. The Central Election Board announced the official results
last week after a review of tally sheets and said it had found no
evidence of fraud.
   Balaguer, 83 and blind from glaucoma, has served five previous
terms as president of this Caribbean nation of 7 million people.

   The Norwegian tanker that exploded and
burned in the Gulf of Mexico last month, has been sold for scrap.
   The 886-foot Mega Borg, which some worried would break up and
spew its 38 million-gallon cargo of Angolan crude into the Gulf,
was sold for about $2.4 million, attorney Robert Klawetter said
Monday. He said the buyers' identities hadn't been disclosed.
   ``The ship is going to be towed to Karachi, Pakistan, where it
will be broken up for scrap,'' he said.
   The new owners take possession Friday, he said.
   An explosion ripped through the pump room of the vessel June 8
as it was transferring the cargo to another vessel for transport to
a Houston refinery about 57 miles southeast Galveston. Two men died
in the explosion, two are missing and presumed dead, and 37 others
were rescued by a nearby vessel.
   The U.S. Coast Guard estimated that 3.9 million gallons of crude
escaped, but most of most of that burned or evaporated.

   A man was beaten and taken away by Cuban
police Tuesday as he tried to enter what serves as a U.S.
diplomatic office in Havana, a State Department spokesman said on
Tuesday night.
   The unknown man entered the grounds of the U.S. interests
section of the Swiss Embassy shortly after 8 a.m., said the
spokesman, David Denny.
   ``While he was on interests section grounds but before he could
enter the building, he was seized, beaten and taken away by Cuban
police who entered U.S. diplomatic property,'' said Denny.
   U.S. diplomats protested the action to the Cuban Foreign
Ministry, he said.
   The United States and Cuba have had no formal diplomatic
relations since 1960. Each has designated another country to be its
formal representative in the other's capital, Switzerland in Havana
and Czechoslovakia in Washington.
   In practice, U.S. diplomats work out of the old U.S. embassy in
Havana under the name of the U.S. interests section of the Swiss
Embassy.
   Cubans seeking asylum have invaded the Spanish, Italian and
Czech embassies in Havana in recent days. Denny said he did not
know whether the appearance of the man at the U.S. interests
section was connected with those other asylum-seekers.

   Attorneys for Florida's death row
inmates have seized on a botched execution, arguing their clients
would be burned alive in the state's electric chair.
   They contend the electric chair is broken, and have produced
photographs of executed inmates in an attempt to prove that killing
a person in the chair amounts to unconstitutionally cruel and
unusual punishment. Two state-paid attorneys have even offered
$4,000 to fix the 66-year-old chair.
   The issue has been raised in five appeals by death row inmates
since the state's last execution May 4. Courts delayed the
executions of all five, but in only one case did the chair issue
play a role in a decision.
   Two other courts rejected the defective chair issue.
   The efforts began after the electrocution of Jesse Tafero.
Flames and smoke shot from under the headpiece he wore.
   The state Department of Corrections and Gov. Bob Martinez have
maintained that Tafero died instantly and that the fire was caused
by a new, synthetic sponge under the headpiece instead of natural
sponge used in other executions.
   The defense lawyers contend that Tafero was burned alive and
that anyone else put to death in the chair would be subjected to
the same torturous fate, thus violating the constitutional ban
against cruel and unusual punishment.
   The faulty-chair issue was raised for the fifth time in an
appeal filed with the Florida Supreme Court for Jerry White, who
was scheduled for execution Wednesday at 7:01 a.m.
   The court on Tuesday rejected White's claims, but gave him his
second 24-hour stay in as many days.
   His attorneys then turned to U.S. District Judge Patricia
Fawsett in Orlando, who also rejected his claims in an order issued
late Tuesday. His case now goes to the 11th Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta. White's execution was rescheduled for Thursday
at 7:01 a.m.
   White, 42, was condemned for shooting a customer to death during
the 1981 robbery of a small grocery store in the central Florida
town of Taft.
   The issue of the chair's condition was raised in the case of
Judi Buenoano, who was granted an indefinite delay by a federal
appeals court.
   The electric chair argument has been rejected in her appeals by
a federal judge in Orlando and by the state Supreme Court, which
said the chair's condition should be decided by the executive
rather than the judicial branch.
   Defense attorneys argue that a broken head electrode lowered the
level of electricity sent through Tafero's body from a fatal 2,400
volts to as low as 90 or 100 volts. Witnesses saw Tafero move and
breathe after the first two jolts of electricity. He was pronounced
dead after the third.
   Color photographs of the last nine men executed in Florida have
been included in the defense motions in an attempt to show that the
damage done to Tafero's skull and leg differs from the damage done
to the head and legs of the eight men executed before him.
   Burn marks on Tafero's body show that he received a much lower
voltage, according to the state agency that represents poor death
row inmates.
   Last week, two agency attorneys offered to donate up to $4,000
to buy a new electrode. In exchange, they would drop the issue from
one inmate's appeal.
   The attorney for a death row inmate executed last week in
Alabama also argued that state's electric chair was defective. The
appeal claimed that electric chair is inhumane, based on two
instances in which inmates were not killed with the first flip of
the switch.

   The Christian-dominated Sabah
United Party again won a majority of seats in legislative assembly
elections in the Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo, officials said
Wednesday.
   The Sabah United Party campaigned on a platform of more autonomy
for Sabah.
   The Elections Commission said that by early Wednesday the Sabah
United Party had taken 33 of the 48 state assembly seats.
   About 70 percent of the 500,000 eligible voters cast their
ballots Monday and Tuesday choosing among 251 candidates. Lawmakers
will serve a 5-year term.
   The Malay-Moslem backed United Sabah National Organization of
former Chief Minister Mustapha Harun won 12 seats.
   No results were available yet in the voting for the three
remaining seats.
   In the last election, the Sabah United Party won 39 seats in the
oil and timber rich state on Borneo island.
   Joseph Pairin Kitingan, a Catholic, retained his seat and will
head the state government once again as chief minister, said party
officials.
   During the campaign, Pairin had called for less interference in
Sabah by the national government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.

   British opposition leader Neil Kinnock
discussed with President Bush on Tuesday the growing momentum
toward German unification and the need for Western aid to the
Soviet Union.
   Kinnock, on a two-day visit to the United States, hopes to
convince U.S. officials and lawmakers that his Labor Party would be
as reliable a partner for Washington in the new Europe as the
Conservative Party government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
or more so.
   Kinnock conceded that his party had traditionally been closer to
the U.S. Democratic Party, but said his talks with the Republican
administration were ``very amicable and rewarding.''
   He said it was too soon to say whether Bush shared with Mrs.
Thatcher the same close relationship she enjoyed with his
predecessor, Ronald Reagan.
   ``I hope she won't be around long enough for us to find out,''
Kinnock said.
   Mrs. Thatcher has been prime minister since 1979, the longest
tenure in office of any government leader in a major Western
country.
   At the start of the 30-minute meeting with Bush in the Oval
Office meeting, Kinnock was asked whether he shared the views of
Thatcher's confidant, Nicholas Ridley, about ``uppity Germans.''
His reply was emphatic. ``Absolutely not. I know very few people
who do.''
   Ridley said in a magazine last week that the Germans were trying
to take over Europe. The ensuing furor led him to resign as Mrs.
Thatcher's trade secretary.
   ``We talked about how to help the Soviets without being
patronizing,'' said Kaufman.
   Kinnock differs from Thatcher and Bush in believing Europe
should help the Soviet Union with more than just technical advice,
but loans and investments that could lead to the purchase of
British goods.
   Kaufman said Kinnock congratulated Bush on his role n bringing
about a relaxation of NATO's defense strategy at the 16-nation
alliance summit in London earlier this month.
   The changed strategy enabled Gorbachev to make his decision
about NATO membership for a united Germany, Kaufman quoted Kinnock
as saying.
   Earlier, in separate meetings with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, Kinnock
emphasized Labor's support for a continued U.S. military presence
in Europe.
   ``The continued U.S. presence is a matter of importance,''
Kinnock said he told the U.S. officials.
   Kinnock's visit was in sharp contrast to his previous trip in
1987, when President Reagan gave Kinnock less than 20 minutes in
the White House, all the while criticizing Labor's demands for
unilateral nuclear disarmament.
   Since then, Kinnock has persuaded Labor to give up that policy
and to accept the presence of American troops and nuclear weapons
in Europe.
   On Wednesday he will be guest of honor at a lunch given by Sen.
Joe Biden, D-Del., who was forced to withdraw from the campaign for
the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination after admitting he
plagiarized a Kinnock speech.

   Police on Tuesday rescued unharmed
a West German businessman abducted at gunpoint five days ago and
arrested four people as kidnappers.
   Wolfgang Rudolf Prinz, 47, president of the Brazilian subsidiary
of Aumund, a West German industrial equipment manufacturer, was
seized by six men on July 12 when he arrived at his factory in Rio.
   TV networks said police trailed two suspected kidnappers to a
two-story house in the Jacarezinho slum district. Law agents raided
the house and freed Prinz, who was found tied up and with a brown
plastic bag over his head.
   Prinz told reporters he was ``well-treated'' by his abductors,
given food on an aluminum plate and beer.
   He was the 30th executive kidnapped in Rio since January and the
first foreigner. About $16 million in ransoms have been paid.

   A stepfather fatally injured a
2-year-old by plunging him headfirst into a toilet during potty
training ``because he had a bad day,'' a prosecutor told jurors
Tuesday in the man's murder trial.
   Thomas Coe, 23, sat expressionless as attorneys made opening
arguments in the first-degree murder and aggravated child-abuse
case, which has already brought changes in state law and
prosecutions of several social workers.
   Bradley McGee died of head injuries July 28, 1989, two months
after he was ordered returned from state foster care to his
biological mother, Sheryl Coe, and her husband, Thomas.
   The defense insisted the parents were just toilet-training the
youngster and believed they were doing right, even if they
``crossed the line.''
   The state, which plans to seek the death penalty if Coe is
convicted, focused opening arguments on the day leading up to the
child's death. Early on, prosecutors told Circuit Court jurors, Coe
flew into a rage, searching for a clean shirt for a job interview.
   He took Bradley and his wife with him and arrived late for the
interview. On the way home, Bradley soiled his pants, the last
straw for Coe, prosecutors said.
   ``That defendant right there,'' assistant state attorney William
Jennings shouted, ``because he had a bad day, took Bradley back
into the bathroom of that trailer, picked him up by the ankles and
repeatedly plunged this small helpless child into that hard
porcelain toilet.
   ``He fully confessed to having dunked Bradley into the toilet so
many times he couldn't even remember,'' Jennings said. ``And the
evidence will show that with Bradley's head still in the toilet _
he flushed it.''
   After that, Coe put his stepson in the shower, then both parents
beat him with pillows until he stiffened and collapsed, prosecutors
said.
   Defense attorney Robert Norgard urged jurors to look at the
facts and not be swayed by emotion.
   ``The bottom line is Mr. Coe did not torture Bradley and did not
maliciously punish him as defined by law,'' Norgard said.
   The Coes were having trouble toilet training the boy and made a
point of using ``negative reinforcement,'' Norgard said.
   ``In their minds they were doing what was right,'' he told the
jurors.
   The defense also asked jurors to be wary of the testimony of
Mrs. Coe, 21, who pleaded no contest to second-degree murder and
aggravated child abuse and is serving 30 years in prison.
   She is expected to be the prosecutions' key witness, testifying
that Coe routinely abused Bradley.
   Norgard said Mrs. Coe has given at least four different versions
of events, trying to distance herself from the incident to make
life easier for herself in prison.
   Bradley was placed in foster care after his mother abandoned him
at a shopping mall when he was 3 months old.
   His death came after a state Department of Health and
Rehabilitative Services caseworker recommended a judge return the
child to his mother, who by then had married Coe, despite a
psychological report that questioned the couple's abilities as
parents and explosive personalities.
   Public outrage over the child's death led legislators to change
the law, placing child welfare above state attempts to reunite
families.
   The case also brought unprecedented charges against four social
workers over their handling of the case. Bradley's main caseworker
was convicted June 15 of felony child abuse for negligence in
recommending that the child be returned to the Coes. The other
three were cleared.

<TEXT>
   A young man whose father was on Wesleyan
University's faculty and whose cousin is accused of killing a
school activist was charged Tuesday in the firebombing of the
school's administration building.
   Federal authorities refused to release the suspect's name
because he was a juvenile at the time of the April firebombing, and
all court proceedings in the case were closed.
   However, police sources speaking on condition of anonymity
identified the suspect as Sudhama Ranganathan, 18, of Middletown.
   Ranganathan's father, Tanjore Ranganathan, who died in 1987, was
an artist in residence at Wesleyan for more than 15 years.
   Ranganathan was a friend of Nicholas Haddad, a 21-year-old
Wesleyan activist who was shot to death July 6 by partners in a
drug distribution ring, according to Hartford police.
   Ranganathan is also the cousin of Kumar Viswanathan, 21, of
Hartford, who has been charged with murder and conspiracy to commit
murder in Haddad's slaying.
   According to the arrest warrant, which was viewed by two
reporters in Middletown before being sealed, Ranganathan is accused
of maliciously damaging and destroying and attempting to damage the
office of Wesleyan President William Chace, which was firebombed
April 7.
   The warrant signed July 16 by federal Magistrate Arthur H.
Latimer in New Haven also accused Ranganathan of receiving and
possessing a firearm that was not registered to him.
   Ranganathan was arrested in Middletown, then taken to federal
court in New Haven.
   He was 17 at the time of the crime.
   Prosecutors and agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms refused to discuss the status of the case.
   But a U.S. marshal said Ranganathan was not being detained. He
left the U.S. courthouse with Allan MacDonald, the chief ATF agent
in New Haven. They then went to MacDonald's office with Assistant
U.S. Attorney Bob Lynn.
   According to Hartford police, Ranganathan had traveled to
Cleveland with his cousin after Haddad's slaying, but returned to
Connecticut on his own.
   Viswanathan, who was arrested at a Cleveland bus station July
14, was arraigned Tuesday in Cleveland. The judge posted a $750,000
bond and Viswanathan waived extradition. Hartford police said
Tuesday that arrangements were being made to return Viswanathan to
Connecticut.
   According to Hartford police, Viswanathan said he met Haddad
through his cousin in Middletown.
   Haddad was found shot in the head in Hartford's Keney Park in
his car, which contained an undisclosed number of semiautomatic
weapons.
   Haddad's activism on the Wesleyan campus had led authorities to
believe he was linked to two firebombings at the school. But state
prosecutors said last week there was no evidence to link the
slaying and the campus attacks.
   The first bombing April 7 burned the rug and floor of Chace's
office in the building and caused extensive smoke damage. The
second firebombing April 29 caused only slight damage to the
outside of the Wesleyan boathouse.
   Dressed in shorts and a tank-top shirt, and wearing earrings in
both ears, Ranganathan was led in handcuffs early Tuesday afternoon
into Latimer's courtroom. He left 45 minutes later with the
handcuffs removed.
   He was then taken to the U.S. District Judge Ellen Burns, where
he spent 25 minutes before being brought to the clerk of court's
office for processing.
   A woman who answered the telephone Tuesday night at the
Middletown home of Tanjore Viswanathan, the father of Kumar
Viswanathan, said, ``None of the family has anything to say.''
   The telephone number for Sudhama Ranganathan in Middletown is
unpublished.

<HEAD>New Parliament Elects Former U.N. Official as Chairman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bulgaria's freely elected Parliament on
Tuesday chose as its chairman a former U.N. official who declared
his opposition to past discriminatory policies against the
country's ethnic Turkish minority.
   In a secret ballot, Nikolai Todorov, 69, the candidate of the
ruling Socialist Party, received 217 votes. Stefan Savov,
representing the opposition Union of Democratic Forces, got 172
votes. Seven deputes abstained and four were absent.
   The Grand National Assembly, or Parliament, still has to elect a
new president to replace Petar Mladenov, who resigned July 6 after
pro-democracy demonstrators claimed he favored using force to put
down pro-democracy demonstrations last year.
   Todorov's election followed a morning session that was marked by
an uproar reflecting lawmakers' inexperience with democracy. It was
the Parliament's first regular meeting. A brief ceremonial
inaugural session was held July 10 in Veliko Turnovo, the ancient
capital.
   The furor erupted when Chavdar Kyuranov, the presidential
candidate of the Socialist Party, tried to make an unscheduled
address.
   Opposition deputies shouted and stamped their feet, not knowing
that their own leadership had agreed to the late morning speech.
   The uproar was finally quieted by Premier Andrei Lukanov, who
told the chamber of the agreement. Zhelyu Zhelev, chairman of the
opposition coalition, confirmed it.
   When he finally got the floor, Kyuranov made a patriotic appeal
for unity.
   ``Bulgaria is above all, above anyone. Bulgaria is above the
opposition and above the majority (former Communists) as well,
because in the whole economic, political and social pluralism there
is one Bulgaria,'' said Kyuranov.
   It was a far cry from parliament meetings in the past when
deputies routinely supported the policies of the orthodox Communist
leader Todor Zhivkov, who was deposed by reform Communists last
November.
   In the afternoon session, both Todorov and Savov underwent
questioning by the lawmakers, a novelty in Bulgaria.
   Todorov said that in articles and interviews, largely published
abroad, he had opposed Zhivkov's policy of persecuting the Turkish
minority, which climaxed in 1984-85 when ethnic Turks were forced
to change their Moslem names to Bulgarian-sounding ones.
   Todorov, a professor and member of the Bulgarian Academy of
Sciences, is the founder of the academy's Institute for Balkan
Studies.
   He worked for several years at the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization and served as ambassador to
Greece in 1979-83.
   The Socialists, the former Communist Party, won a majority of
211 places in the 400-seat Parliament in Bulgaria's first free
elections in 58 years last month. The Union of Democratic Forces
captured 144 seats. Smaller parties shared the remaining seats.
   It was not clear whether the Parliament would elect the
country's new president when it reconvenes Wednesday.

   A man accused of heading a scheme to smuggle a
sophisticated computer with military applications out of the United
States pleaded guilty Tuesday in federal court, officials said.
   The computer was bound for the Soviet Union, said U.S. Attorney
Mike McKay, who announced the plea.
   Shiv Mohan of New Delhi, India, was ordered to pay $1.5 million
in fines and forfeitures and could serve as much as 3{ years in
prison, said U.S. Attorney Mike McKay.
   Mohan, 47, pleaded guilty to 24 counts of conspiracy to violate
the Export Administration Act, money laundering statutes and other
charges before U.S. District Judge William L. Dwyer. Sentencing was
set for Sept. 10.
   Mohan admitted involvement in smuggling a DEC VAX 8700 computer
out of the United States. He said he transferred $490,000 from
Great Britain to the United States to purchase the computer.
   The computer was stopped in transit by commerce agents, who were
tipped off and found it being shipped in several boxes marked
``spare parts,'' said Paula Boggs, assistant U.S. attorney.
   Four other defendants have also pleaded guilty in the case.
   Sentencing is scheduled for Aug. 3 for Robert Casperson, 44, of
Kirkland, Wash.; John Townsend, 41, of Sydney, Australia; David
Whyte, 42, of Toronto and Sham Malhotra, 47, of New York.
   Authorities still sought for two defendants who fled; Dr.
Sidhartha Bose of London and T. Raganathan of Singapore.

   At least 12 Cuban asylum-seekers remained
holed up Tuesday in diplomatic compounds in Havana, but another 12
Cubans voluntarily abandoned the Czechoslovak embassy where they
had sought refuge, according to officials and news reports.
   Cuba's official Prensa Latina news agency quoted a foreign
ministry statement as saying the Communist government would never
yield to any ``pressure or blackmail'' by people seeking to leave
the Communist island 90 miles south of Florida.
   In Washington, a State Department spokesman said a Cuban man was
beaten and taken away by police Tuesday morning as he tried to
enter the U.S. interests section in Havana. It works out of the
former U.S. Embassy but officially operates under the auspices of
the Swiss Embassy.
   ``While he was on interests section grounds but before he could
enter the building, he was seized, beaten and taken away by Cuban
police who entered U.S. diplomatic property,'' said State
Department spokesman David Denny.
   U.S. diplomats protested the action to Cuba's foreign ministry,
he said.
   The Spanish news agency EFE reported four Cubans seeking
political asylum took refuge Tuesday afternon at the Italian
ambassador's residence in Cuba's capital.
   The two men and two women first climbed to the roof of the
ambassador's house after failing to gain entry, EFE said in a
report monitored in Madrid, Spain. They later managed to get inside
the building.
   Three Cuban asylum-seekers who took refuge last week remained at
the Spanish embassy in Havana.
   A Spanish foreign ministry spokeswoman said a Cuban family
entered the Spanish embassy Tuesday seeking refuge and assistance
in getting to Spain.
   EFE reported the couple and their two children left the building
several hours later after speaking to embassy officials. The four
were carrying Cuban passports with exit visas, and had come to the
embassy to request visas permitting them to enter Spain, EFE said.
   On Friday, Cuban police entered the embassy grounds in pursuit
of a young Cuban who was attempting to seek refuge and arrested
him. The Cuban foreign minister apologized for that incident after
the Spanish ambassador sent a note or protest.
   Five Cubans remained holed up Tuesday in the apartment of the
Czechoslovak Charge d'Affaires Jan Doemoek, according to a
statement released by the Cuban foreign ministry.
   Another 12 Cubans voluntarily and unconditionally abandoned the
Czechoslovak embassy on Monday evening, according to officials and
news reports. The first Cubans had arrived there July 9.
   There were conflicting reports about the terms of their
agreement to leave the embassy.
   The Cuban foreign ministry, in its statement released by Prensa
Latina, said the 12 Cubans were detained for questioning in an
investigation into what the Cuban government described as ``a
planned provocation'' around the Czechoslovak embassy, according to
Prensa Latina.
   It said the Cubans would not face prosecution because they had
left the embassy voluntarily and would be allowed to return to
their homes upon completion of the investigation.
   However, the statement indicated that they would not be allowed
to leave Cuba.
   ``The elements who enter ... any Western embassy, if they do not
merit asylum, will never leave this country in that manner,'' the
statement said.
   A Czechoslovak foreign ministry official, Jindrich Opava, said
by telephone Tuesday that he had no details on the circumstances of
the asylum-seekers' leaving.
   Seven of the 12 Cubans took several diplomats hostage Monday at
the Czechoslovak embassy. Czechoslovak television reported later
that all the diplomats were released unharmed. Notimex, the Mexican
government news agency, reported from Havana that the seven then
shouted out a window they would blow up the embassy if their demand
for a plane to the United States was not met.
   Cuba and Czechoslovakia had been close allies until last fall's
democratic upheaval toppled Prague's hard-line Communist leaders.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro is one of a handful of surviving
hard-line Marxist leaders after a reformist trend swept Eastern
Europe last year.
   Castro, in his first official statement on the matter, called
the asylum-seekers ``antisocial elements encouraged by Czechoslovak
diplomats,'' the Czechoslovak newspaper Lidova Demokracie said
Monday.
   Ramon Cernuda, an anti-Castro Cuban human rights activist in
Miami, said that among the asylum seekers identified by the Cuban
government were three noted dissidents.
   Novoa Ponce, Mari Becerra and Cabrera Puentes had been
imprisoned last year after they formed a group to promote artistic
freedom, Cernuda said.
   It was not immediately known whether they were among those who
left the Czechoslovak embassy.

   The decision, announced Monday by Gorbachev and West German

   ``We have throughout argued that a united Germany in NATO would
be in the best interests of all those concerned,'' it said in a

   Authorities said today that about 200
people were killed in a major earthquake, and television reports
said the worst affected areas were woefully short of blood,
medicine and rescue equipment.
   Scores of buildings were destroyed by Monday's temblor and the
death toll was expected to rise as rescuers pulled more bodies from
the rubble.
   The Office of Civil Defense counted 193 dead and 595 injured in
the quake, which measured 7.7 on the Richter scale and struck the
country's main island of Luzon, including Manila. Its epicenter was
60 miles north of the capital.
   Officials complained that rescue efforts were hampered by a lack

   The school choice plan, which has drawn praise from the Bush

hearing this month that could determine its immediate fate.
   The hearing is the result of a lawsuit, urged by state School
Superintendent Herbert Grover and filed by opponents of the plan,
that challenges the constitutionality of using state money for
private schools.
   The Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to immediately review the

<HEAD>European Mollusks Invading Great Lakes Are Here To Stay</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   By JEFFREY ULBRICH&equals;
Associated Press Writer&equals;
   TORONTO (AP) _ A small European freshwater mollusk called the
zebra mussel has spread at an alarming rate since it was found in
the Great Lakes in 1988, threatening the ecosystem and clogging up
industry.
   Experts say there is no way to wipe the mussels out.
   ``In the Great Lakes, all we can do is accept the fact that they
are here and learn to live with it,'' said Gerry Mackie, a biology
professor at the University of Guelph who specializes in freshwater
bivalves.
   Criticism in Canada focuses on the government's slowness in
attacking the problem.
   ``The invasion of the zebra mussels was preventable,'' the
Toronto Globe and Mail said in an editorial. ``Canada's complacency
let it happen, and may enable similar invasions unless the country
takes strong preventive measures.''
   Joe Comuzzi, a Liberal member of Parliament, complained recently
that Ottawa had committed only $230,000 ($195,500 U.S.) to the
problem. He said that ``doesn't even pay for the paper to write a
report.''
   The mussel invasion has been expensive for Ontario Hydro, which
has power plants along the lake shore.
   Zebra mussels produce a sticky thread that attaches them to
solid objects _ water pipes in Ontario Hydro's case. The mussels
are capable of sticking in such numbers that they stop or greatly
reduce the flow of water.
   Large intake pipes are not affected, but the mussels swim up
into the small-diameter service piping inside the plants.
   Their presence also leads to corrosion.
   ``It has cost us well over $6 million to retrofit all of the
stations for this year, and it's costing us lots in research,''
said Renata Claudi, a senior scientist with the utility company.
   Representatives of 13 companies in the Chemical Valley of
Sarnia, Ontario, got together this month to work out a common
strategy against the mollusks.
   The zebra mussel, about 1{ inches in diameter, is a
dark-colored, clam-like creature with white stripes.
   It has a larval stage of about a month when it swims with the
currents. That accounts for much of its rapid spread throug the
Great Lakes.
   Some of the mollusks hitch rides on ships up the lakes through
Huron, Michigan and Superior and others swim down the current into
the St. Lawrence Seaway.
   A female produces 30,000 to 40,000 eggs in each of its two or
three years of life.
   Experts agree zebra mussels entered the Great Lakes system in
Lake St. Clair in the summer of 1985 or 1986. They probably were
flushed from the ballast of a ship that came from Europe.
   All the Great Lakes now are infested and scientists say their
passage into the Mississippi River system is inevitable.
   ``They have gone through the Niagara River and into Lake
Ontario,'' Ms. Claudi said. ``Now they are swimming their way
toward Toronto.''
   Scientists are not sure what the ecological impact will be, but
are fearful of it.
   ``You have to keep it in perspective,'' said Joe Leach, a
research scientist with the Ontario Natural Resources Ministry.
``The major impacts right now are with the technical devices, pipes
and so on. We ... are looking at potention impacts on ... fishes,
but at the present time there is no indication of major ecological
impact.''
   Leach said the main fears were disruption of spawning for fish
like walleye, which lay their eggs on hard, rocky areas, and that
the food chain would be altered.
   ``These things are filter feeders,'' he said. ``They filter an
enormous amount of water and take everything out of it. What they
don't use, they put mucus around and drop it down to the bottom.''
   That shifts a lot of organic matter from the water to the bottom
of the lake. Leach said it eventually could change fish populations
by reducing the number of water column feeders, such as walleye and
trout, and increasing catfish, sturgeon and other bottom feeders.
   There also is increasing evidence of zebra mussels attaching to
other bivalves and smothering them.
   ``As it stands now, there isn't anything you can do,'' Leach
said. ``There is no way you can control them. If you use poison,
you are going to poison the system.''
   Ontario Hydro uses chlorine, the most effective molluscicide
found so far.
   In one affected plant, Ms. Claudi said, the company ``applied
sodium hypochlorite in relatively small doses for about two weeks.
That basically did them in and all we had to worry about was
cleaning out the shells.''
   She added that the amount used, in an agreement with the
Environment Ministry, ``is never more than 10 parts per billion.
Compare that with the five parts per million of the same stuff in
the drinking water we happily drink every day.''
   Ms. Claudi says Ontario Hydro was talking to other utilities
across the lakes, the American Waterworks Association and Electric
Power Research Association, ``but we're finding that we are way
ahead or at the same level as these guys'' in research.
   Most experts believe the zebra mussel population eventually will
level off and perhaps even decline, but Mackie said the problem was
``trying to determine at what point they will level off or if they
will crash.''
   Geoff Holland of the federal fisheries and oceans department
said Canadian officials probably would meet with provincial and
U.S. representatives this fall to work out a budget for fighting
the zebra mussel.
   As for Ontario Hydro, Ms. Claudi said: ``Prevention is really
what we're looking at. We just don't want those guys in our pipe.''

<HEAD>Little Italy: Smaller and Smaller</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Little Italy is getting smaller.
   Squeezed by gentrification from Soho to the north and by
immigration from Chinatown to the south, the nation's most famous
Italian-American enclave is turning into a Mediterranean version of
Colonial Williamsburg.
   Little Italy, says urban folklorist Joseph Sciorra, is ``a
Disneyland for suburbanites who want to recharge their ethnic
batteries.''
   Buildings on Mulberry Street still are filled with Italian
restaurants, cafes and food stores, but the names on the mailboxes
for the apartments upstairs _ and the deeds _ are Chinese.
   ``It just isn't an Italian-American community,'' says
sociologist Donald Tricarico. ``There's an ethnic economy with
nothing underneath. Young Italians have been leaving for years.''
   ``This is really Little China,'' says restaurateur Anthony Luna.
``I don't know why they call it Little Italy.''
   Little Italy, once a 50-block area stretching from Broadway to
the Bowery and from Houston to Canal streets, is now less than half
its original size. There are only a few thousand Italians left,
many of them elderly.
   Of the 4,200 legal immigrants who moved into the 10013 ZIP code
between 1983 and 1987, 3,727 came from China, Taiwan or Hong Kong.
Just 11 came from Italy.
   Even the Mafia is not the same, certainly not since Little
Italy's most famous mob restaurant, Umberto's Clam Bar, was seized
by the government.
   ``The tough guys are still around, but they don't live in the
neighborhood,'' says Tricarico. ``They commute.''
   That includes John Gotti, reputed boss of the Gambino crime
family, who crosses the bridge from Queens every day in his
Mercedes.
   Italians began moving into lower Manhattan in the 1880s, and
between 1890 and 1924, they displaced their Irish predecessors on
the blocks along Mulberry Street. By 1932, 98 percent of the
residents were of Italian birth or parentage, and as late as the
1950s, many young people stayed to raise families.
   But the tenements got older and even more crowded, and
confidence in the neighborhood was undercut by plans _ since
abandoned _ to build an expressway through it. Italians fled to the
suburbs in vast numbers; today, neighboring Westchester has more
Italian-Americans than any county in the nation.
   Meanwhile, neighboring Chinatown's population was rising from
11,000 in 1941 to more than 70,000 now. For years, Canal Street had
divided the two communities, but in the 1970s the Chinese began to
spill across that cultural moat.
   There was some resistance _ graffiti was scrawled on some of the
new Chinese signs _ but the newcomers paid top dollar. In 1980, a
real estate man named John Zaccaro _ the husband of former vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro _ was quoted as saying
that 70 percent of the district's buildings were owned by Chinese.
   Today, buildings with Italian names carved into the masonry bear
signs with Chinese characters, and the floors above the Italian
restaurants are occupied by Chinese workshops. Lendy's on Grand
Street, for years a popular Italian hardware store, is now a
popular Chinese hardware store.
   But Little Italy is sustained by its two enduring assets: its
food and its mobsters, a combination that seems to appeal to
tourists.
   The Chamber of Commerce says Little Italy gets about 100,000
visitors a month, and a seven-story tourist hotel _ the
neighborhood's first _ is scheduled to break ground later this year.
   Although the Mafia's influence has shrunk along with the
neighborhood, ``the publicity about the Mafia is good for the
restaurants,'' Tricarico says. ``People come in to drink cappuccino
and see the mobsters.''
   The chief attraction is Gotti, who eats lunch at restaurants
like Forlini's and Giambone's, where he frequently shares the
dining room with prosecutors and judges from the court buildings
nearby. Sated, he repairs to the Ravenite Social Club for meetings
with associates.
   A walk past the Ravenite, a modest brick storefront at 247
Mulberry, has become part of the Little Italy experience, along
with pasta at Angelo's and cannoli at Ferrara's.
   Other stops include Umberto's, where ``Crazy Joe'' Gallo was
shot in the back while dining on the seafood combination; Benito
II, outside which Salvatore ``Sally Bugs'' Brigulio was gunned
down; and Ruggero, where former Gambino consiglieri Joseph N. Gallo
_ no known relation to Crazy Joe _ often sat at a table in front of
the bar.
   Sometimes the neighborhood seems like a movie set, and sometimes
it really is. Earlier this spring, a make-believe street fair with
sausage vendors and ``Kiss Me I'm Italian'' buttons was staged by
the makers of ``The Godfather, Part III.''
   After a big shootout scene, one elderly onlooker said she was
thrilled _ she'd never seen anything like that in the real Little
Italy.
   In fact, as the Mafia's schemes have grown larger and more
sophisticated, the old neighborhood rackets _ numbers, extortion,
small-time loan sharking _ have become less important. ``They have
bigger fish to fry now,'' says Tricarico. ``There's no need to
control their old neighborhoods.''
   At least, there's still plenty to eat. Little Italy boasts 56
restaurants, 16 cafes and several dozen food stores. The latter
include Alleva, founded in 1892 and reputedly the nation's oldest
mozzarella maker, and Piemonte, which makes 20 different kinds of
pasta daily.
   ``We serve real Italian food,'' says Anne Compoccia, a leading
neighborhood booster. ``Not fettuccine with strawberries on it.''
   Ms. Compoccia insists that Little Italy's Old World charm, and
its residents' determination to stay put, will ensure the survival
of this neighborhood-turned-tourist attraction.
   ``We're stemming the tide,'' she says. ``Even if it's down to
just 10 blocks, we're going to preserve it.''

<HEAD>The Folsom Family Struggles With AIDS, Suicide</HEAD>

   Doug Folsom bought a gun, left a recorded
message telling his wife to ``hang tough,'' climbed into the
hammock outside his family's Duxbury home and pulled the trigger.
   That was more than a month ago, on June 6.
   The suicide followed two years of watching his young wife and
3-year-old daughter Angela wither from acquired immune deficiency
syndrome. He lived with the fear that 4-year-old Nicolette, who so
far has managed to escape the disease, would test positive.
   ``That poor man, watching his little girl and his wife just go
through this deterioration. This forced him to kill himself,
something he said he'd never do. So he was forced to leave me,''
said Jennifer Folsom, her body frail from fighting the disease and
struggling to keep her family together.
   She studied a framed photograph of the couple taken years
earlier. Both are smiling, Doug's arm is tossed over her shoulders.
The picture rests on a table within easy reach of Jennifer's chair,
surrounded by tissues and bottles of medication.
   ``I have a very strong attitude of `Try me.' His whole attitude
was `Why me?' He danced as long as he could. The wind was just
taken out of his sails. I feel bad for him. He didn't deserve
that.''
   AIDS has been a relentless enemy since Jennifer was diagnosed in
February 1988. The doctor gave her the test results in his empty
office after closing; he was concerned, she said, about how his
staff would react to an AIDS patient.
   ``I drove home. It was a long ride,'' Jennifer recalled. ``All I
could see was gloom and doom and death. I thought of suicide. I
went into my room and I didn't ever want to come out.''
   It seemed incredible that a blood transfusion during an
emergency appendectomy in a Massachusetts hospital in 1979 _ before
blood supplies were tested and purged of the virus _ probably
carried the AIDS virus into her body.
   Angie, she said, contracted the virus during the pregnancy or
later from breast-feeding. Nicolette is tested every six months,
and Jennifer prays her healthy, older daughter will remain free
from AIDS.
   ``Here I am, this white, middle-class housewife living in
Vermont, trying to make a living. How dare this disease come into
my home? It's AIDS. I eat and drink and sleep AIDS. But I'm not
afraid of it anymore,'' Jennifer said.
   Jennifer told her parents she was suffering from AIDS, but told
others that she had cancer: ``We weren't sure how people were going
to react,'' she said.
   She and Doug worried that business would fall off, that people
would be afraid to come to their auto-body shop. The health
insurance bill, which runs about $560 monthly, continues to be the
first bill paid each month, and she is left with about $10,000 in
other unpaid bills.
   Her nightmare had been that Nicolette would be harassed when she
starts school next year _ a fear the school nurse put to rest by
telling Jennifer, ``There will be no discrimination here.''
   Jennifer lives day to day, and the past week had been a bad one.
She was wrapped in a blue-and-white afghan and tired. She had lost
10 pounds last month, and was worried about Angie's lesions and
weight loss.
   Angie, damp from a bath and refusing to be moved off her
mother's lap, was struggling to breathe with a feeding tube up one
nostril and a pacifier wedged stubbornly in her mouth.
   Jennifer glanced distractedly out the living-room windows,
overlooking a faded yellow motorboat parked in the side yard and a
small, neat vegetable garden. Wind chimes blew in a breeze along a
second-floor balcony.
   ``I lie in bed and there are days I don't even want to get up.
It's hard dealing with family life and self-worth, knowing that I
can't care for my own kids and my husband,'' she said, breaking
down. Then quickly regaining control, she said, ``I have such a
strong gene in me that wants to go on. I hope I can hang on.
   ``I went to a party this weekend at my sister's. And I was
sitting there exhausted and I thought ... `I'm 29 years old. I just
can't be doing what a normal kid would be doing.' ''
   She wants to tell her story, she said, so people will realize
the AIDS epidemic exists in rural areas of Vermont.
   ``Vermont does have AIDS,'' she said. ``The children of this
generation need to be taught now because we don't know if there is
going to be a cure.''
   She wants to ``live with dignity and not have people whispering
behind my back. I'm not ashamed of who I am. (AIDS) invaded my home
without permission. I'm just hoping that by me going public,
somebody else can be helped.''
   For her own help, Jennifer relies on her family. Her parents
visit daily to help care for the children, her brother has taken a
leave of absence from his Washington job to help Jennifer wade
through the red tape of locating financial assistance, and other
sisters and brothers help out.
   ``We've also gone through the anger and the hurt,'' said
Jennifer's mother, June Kenney. ``It's not right to see your
daughter so sick when she's so young. They should be going on
picnics and dancing.''
   A visiting nurse stops by the home to provide the health care
that supplements Jennifer and Angie's weekly trips to the
University Health Center in Burlington, and two community
fund-raisers are planned to help raise money to cover the mortgage
and medical bills.
   Jennifer also attends a support group _ one woman, 10 homosexual
men.
   Although a recent entry in her diary reads, ``Survival will come
from humor, optimism, laughter and self-worth,'' Jennifer knows
death is inevitable.
   ``I think about it more lately, that death is reality, this is
reality. You can't wash it off in the shower. It's here and it's
real and there's no light at the end of that tunnel. It keeps
closing in. I tell myself constantly, `You've come too far to give
in now.' I just wish it would go away, and I know it's not going to
go away,'' she said.
   Doug Folsom knew all of this, and he could not bear it.
Nicolette, who says her mother and sister have ``buggies,''
understands as well; she once drew a picture of the blue sky with a
rope hanging down to the house, telling Jennifer it was God sending
a rope for Angie.
   But Nicolette recently amended the caption.
   ``It was for Daddy,'' she said.

<HEAD>Changing The Attitude Toward Overspending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When some of the best minds and the most
powerful legislative bodies cannot resolve budget deficits,
taxpayers might have to seek new ways to pressure elected officials.
   Here are a few suggestions gleaned from various sources.
   _Question the elected person's patriotism.
   Since deficits incurred by one generation are a tax and economic
liability on future generations, the effect is that of taxation
without representation, a a violation of the American principle of
fair play.
   According to the patriots of the American Revolution, taxation
without representatation is tyranny, oppression, a violation of the
rights of free men and women. Millions of future generations,
therefore, are unfairly taxed.
   Economist E. Erich Heinemann poses the problem and challenges
succinctly: ``Unless the generation that consumes federal services
also pays for them, there will never be a durable majority to limit
the size of government.''
   _Apply psychological pressure on elected officials.
   Individuals who consistently, habitually spend beyond their
means are viewed in a variety of negative ways.
   Many people see them as irresponsible and shiftless. Some view
them as ignorant. Some consider them immoral. In serious cases,
psychological counseling and therapy are often recommended.
   It has been recommended that the same attitudes be applied to
political spending and spenders. Since public image is essential to
political survival, the fear of being branded might stir a
politician's survival instincts.
   _Publicize the historical record. Publicize the broken promises.
   Attempts to cut budget deficits through higher taxes have a long
record of failure. So have so-called budget summits and promises.
It is an old political tradition to be against taxes, but somehow
taxes continue to rise.
   Generally speaking, additional revenues from tax increases have
been used to justify more spending. ``When the government raises a
dollar in revenues, Congress spends a dollar fifty,'' President
Bush once explained.
   Regarding promises, Citizens for a Sound Economy, an
independent, non-profit research group, reminded members that a
1987 agreement between the White House and Congress to limit
spending growth led instead to quickened spending.
   That agreement called for restraining spending increases to $50
billion in 1988 and 1989. But in those two years spending increased
by $139 billion.
   It provoked the Tax Foundation _ independent, non-profit,
research oriented _ to warn of tax summitry. ``By the light of
recent budget summit history,'' it said, ``any deficit reduction
deal could be a bad deal for taxpayers.''
   A foundation study found that in the 1980s, ``the fiscal years
that were not preceded by budget summits actually resulted in the
most real deficit reduction.''
   _Remind voters that Washington is a somewhat ineffective spender
of money.
   Robert Woodson Jr., congressional liaison for the National
Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, which promotes the idea of
self-help, contends that social spending has empowered bureaucrats
but not necessarily the poor.
   ``It's been estimated that 70 cents of every federal dollar
spent on social service programs goes to the people, agencies, and
organizations who serve the poor,'' he states, adding:
   ``The big spenders in Congress should be asking themselves now,
`Why hasn't the face of poverty changed?'''
   Many other suggestions are heard every day: Demand explanations.
Expose selfish, special-interest spending proposals. Publicize
waste. Encourage the development of a return-on-investment guide to
government spending.
   All the ideas circulating seem to have one common theme, to
again make it politically unpalatable for elected officials to
overspend.

<HEAD>O'Flaherty's Irish Channel: Real Irish Music in the French Quarter</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JANET McCONNAUGHEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Danny O'Flaherty has just finished a rousing
rendition of ``Kelly, the Boy From Killeen.'' A barmaid gives him
several slips of paper, some folded around money. He reads them and
goes back to the mike at his Irish pub in the French Quarter.
   ``We've been getting a lot of requests for `Danny Boy.' We don't
do that. We only do the right stuff,'' he tells the audience. ``If
you'll read the literature at your table, you'll understand.''
   ``Danny Boy'' isn't the only tune nixed by O'Flaherty. He also
rejects ``When Irish Eyes Are Smiling'' and other overplayed ersatz
Irish tunes.
   ``That's not Ireland,'' he said. ``There's nothing wrong with
those songs; we just have something better.''
   Opened in December, the Irish Channel is only one block from the
Mississippi River in a sprawling old building with a courtyard
separating two very different bars.
   One is the ballad room, featuring regular performances by
O'Flaherty, who spent three years touring with The Irish Minstrels
and 16 years with his own trio, the Celtic Folk _ a group that has
10 albums and has played for presidents and the pope and in
festivals as far away as Israel.
   The other is called The Informer, the bigger room across the
courtyard. It has a jukebox, a television and four dart boards.
   You can sit and talk as loudly as you want in The Informer or in
the courtyard. But if you insist on talking out in the Ballad Room,
especially during some of the more poignant songs, you'll be asked
to leave.
   ``It's probably the most unmannerly thing anyone could do _ talk
while other people are performing,'' said O'Flaherty.
   But he acknowledges few other bars or pubs have such a
requirement _ especially not in the boisterous French Quarter.
``Maybe we have to open up a university in America so people can go
to university and learn how to listen.''
   The amplification, from speakers hung at what would be ceiling
level if the second floor of the Ballad Room hadn't been torn out,
is loud enough to cover most quiet conversations. In fact, although
you see mouths moving during sing-along choruses, you don't hear
anyone but O'Flaherty until he stops to listen.
   People drinking Guinness, Harp, Double Diamond, Carlsberg and
Miller Lite (``Not everybody likes to drink Irish,'' said the
bartender) at the 25 or so little tables include tourists and
locals, white-haired couples and young adults with children.
   O'Flaherty learned how to listen, to sing and to play guitar,
mandolin, accordion, banjo, harmonica and tin whistle in Galway and
his home island of Innishmor, off the Galway coast. He left in
September 1970 to work for his uncle's construction company in
Chicago. He played and sang on weekends, and about six months after
he arrived, the Irish Minstrels asked him to audition.
   He toured with them for three years. In early 1974, tired of
airports, he decided to settle in Washington, with his first wife.
``I quit the music business for six weeks. That's all I could
last,'' he said.
   A woman hired him to play at her wedding. O'Flaherty and his
brother, Patrick, borrowed a mandolin and a guitar. Three weeks
later, they were hired as the weekend entertainment at The
Dubliner, which had just opened on Capitol Hill.
   They decided to get away from pseudo-Irish schmaltz and rabid
paeans to the Irish Republican Army during the early '80s, when
they were performing at clubs and folk festivals around the East
Coast.
   ``We were doing anti-war when it wasn't kosher,'' said
O'Flaherty.
   Patrick O'Flaherty is currently touring with a group called the
Gaelic Shores, and Welsh harpist Robin James-Jones shares the Irish
Channel stage.
   O'Flaherty's emphasis on folk music doesn't mean he refuses to
sing anything that's not Irish _ or even songs that aren't ancient
and anonymous.
   An evening in the ballad room is likely to include ``And the
Band Played Waltzing Matilda,'' an anti-war song about the Battle
of Gallipoli, and a spectacularly non-Irish children's tune called
``Waltzing With Bears,'' as well as ``Wild Mountain Thyme'' or
``The Maid of Five-e-o.''
   So what's an Irish pub doing in the French Quarter?
   ``I don't find a bar like this surprising for a city that has
five or seven St. Patrick's Day parades,'' said Don Jennings, a
member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians and the Irish Channel St.
Patrick's Day Committee.
   Perhaps more to the point, the brothers and Danny O'Flaherty's
wife, Susan, like the city, where an invitation for a bar gig
during the 1984 World's Fair wound up stretching into a two-year
stint that soon was followed by another.
   When they left, they missed New Orleans, O'Flaherty said.
   ``We didn't realize how lucky we were to live in New Orleans or
how nice it was until we left,'' he said. ``The other reason, my
wife and I, before we left New Orleans, we lost twins. They're
buried here in New Orleans.''
   They returned in 1989 to open a pub as a home base for the
Celtic Folk, and as a living that didn't call for quite so much
touring.
   New Orleans' French, Spanish and African-American heritage is
well known. ``The Irishness of the city is quiet. Once you research
and dig down deep, there's a lot of things the Irish have done in a
very positive manner in this city,'' O'Flaherty said.
   Irish immigrants dug the canal after which Canal Street is
named. Many believe they gave New Orleans the accent known locally
as ``da Yat axsent'' _ a very close cousin to da way dey talk in
Noo Yawk, where Irish immigrants also settled. And they settled the
Irish Channel along the riverfront.
   O'Flaherty said he wanted to make his pub a center for that
history, as well as for the older Irish heritage of his native
land. However, he said he was advised against actually opening a
bar in the Irish Channel, because too few people would find it.
   The bar has broken even most months, he said, though unluckily
it opened in December, when New Orleans went through one of its
worst freezes ever. June was also rough _ the number of tourists
and conventions had begun to slack off, and the groups that did
come to town included the National Baptist Convention.
   Coming attractions include concerts by Tommy Makem, the Clancy
Brothers and bluegrass fiddler Kenny Kosek, who has recorded with
Jerry Garcia and Laurie Anderson as well as the Celtic Folk.
   O'Flaherty also would like to have a pub theater, but that's
still a dream.
   ``We haven't even reached what we want to do yet,'' he said.
``We've got to crawl before we walk.''

   Bonnie Bedelia has been around long enough to
know the percentages: There are more good actors than good parts,
and a lot more good parts for men than for women.
   There's usually one decent female part per film, she says, and
the numbers have often worked against her. ``Lovers and Other
Strangers'' was a bad role in a good film. ``Prince of
Pennsylvania'' was a good part in a bad film. ``Fat Man and Little
Boy'' struck out on both counts. ``Die Hard'' and ``Die Hard 2''
were fun, but those movies belong to Bruce Willis.
   Even a big part in a good film can come up short, such as her
acclaimed role as auto racer Shirley Muldowney in the 1983 film
``Heart Like a Wheel.'' Compliment her on it and the response is
terse: ``Yeah, it would have been nice if someone saw it.''
   But for ``Presumed Innocent,'' there are no frowns or
wisecracks. Finally, it's all there: the cast (Harrison Ford, Raul
Julia), the director (Alan Pakula _ ``Klute,'' ``All the
President's Men''), the script (based on Scott Turow's best-selling
thriller) and yes, the part she wanted.
   ``How often does anyone get a chance to be in film like that?''
says Bedelia, who plays Ford's wife. ``I would have to be put in
Bellevue if I didn't want that part. What's not to want to do it? I
want to work. I want a career. Everyone wanted to do it.
   ``It was the top of the line, all along the way. You don't get
better than that.''
   That's the talk of a self-described ``lifer'' convinced she can
play anything, an actress who's been at it for 30 years, first
appearing on Broadway in ``Isle of Children'' at age 10. She wishes
more people knew who she was _ ``I hear someone say, `She looks
familiar, did I go to school with her?''' _ but accepts it all
because acting's all she ever wanted to do.
   ``I did have a natural gift for suspending reality,'' she said,
pausing and then smiling at that piece of actor's talk.
   ``My big brother used to make up these elaborate fantasy games
where we'd be on adventures.He'd make up these stories about us
being orphans or we'd move our bunk beds and make them into tents
and pretend we were in the woods. It's one of those fantastic free
association games that kids can do.''
   She remembers being homesick during ``Lovers and Other
Strangers,'' carrying her first of two sons and wishing she were
shopping for baby clothes. And ``They Shoot Horses, Don't They?''
She remembers how much fun it was making the whole film on that
single dance floor.
   On one end of her career is ``Heart Like a Wheel,'' her most
challenging, rewarding part, wasted on a box-office flop. It was
low budget _ ``Most of the money spent on cars,'' she cracks _ and
covered four decades, often in one day of filming.
   ``I'd get up in the morning and be 40, with the little wrinkles
in my eyes and the gray in my hair,'' she said.
   ``The very next scene, I'd run to makeup and I had to erase all
that mileage in my life and suddenly I was 16 years old and had to
go greet my dad. Then I was 30 and had this short hairdo and false
eyelashes.''
   On the other end, are the ``Die Hard'' movies _ the latest one
reportedly costing more than $60 million. Everyone's seen at least
one of those films, but who remembers that it was Bonnie Bedelia
playing Willis' wife?
   ``I just said my words and went home,'' Bedelia said. ``They
were fun, though. I really liked the directors, John McTiernan from
the first one and Renny Harlin for this one. And I really liked
Bruce Willis. I only worked for a couple of weeks on the first one
and a few days on the second.''
   So will ``Presumed Innocent'' end the days of Bonnie
Watchamacallit? She's not saying _ a lifer's superstition. Again,
it's playing the percentages, the invariable rule of mathematics.
How often does a film turn out the way it's supposed to?
   ``I made a movie in Mexico called `Fat Man and Little Boy,'''
she said of last year's critical and commercial failure.
   ``Roland Joffe was directing and he made one of my favorite
movies of all time, `The Killing Fields.' Paul Newman was starring,
and me and Natasha Richardson and Laura Dern and John Cusack were
in the cast, all of us good actors. I felt pretty good about that,
too, and look how that turned out. It wasn't that good.''

<HEAD>Taiwan Tries To Stop Smuggling by Fishermen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NANLIAO, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At the start of another stifling summer
day, the fishermen of Nanliao and their wives gather near a
Buddhist temple to pray for the return of their profitable, but
illegal, livelihood.
   The 2,000 villagers have had little else to do since early June,
when Nanliao became the first target of a government attempt to
stamp out smuggling.
   ``There is virtually nothing fishermen can now do,'' said one,
who identified himself only by the surname Pan. ``Local fishing
grounds have been destroyed by pollution and our fishermen had to
risk smuggling to make a living.''
   Nanliao gets no sympathy from Premier Hau Pei-tsun, a career
military man who says the smuggling of guns, narcotics, prostitutes
and triggermen for Taiwan mobsters is responsible for a soaring
crime rate.
   Robberies increased by 39 percent and kidnappings by 53 percent
in 1989, a record year for violent crime.
   Police seized nearly 1,000 handguns last year and estimate
thousands more remained in the hands of gangsters. They said most
of the weapons were smuggled from China and the Philippines.
   Newspapers print reports of young women from the mainland caught
working in the numerous illegal brothels of Taiwan.
   ``Smuggling has not only posed a threat to public security, but
has seriously affected our economic development,'' Hau declared.
The premier says crime is driving industries off the island.
   Military patrols were removed from the ports when Taiwan ended
38 years of martial law in 1987, and smuggling has risen sharply.
   Nanliao is just 80 miles across the Formosa Strait from Fujian
province in southern China. Officials believe nearly everyone in
town was involved in smuggling and claim villagers beat up police
whenever they tried to stop it.
   About 1,000 soldiers were sent to reinforce air and coastal
patrols in the area and impose a curfew to stop smuggled goods from
being brought ashore at night. The trade slowed to a trickle.
   Fishermen acknowledge their illegal activity has made the
village one of Taiwan's richest. With the proceeds from smuggling,
residents of Nanliao replaced their traditional brick-and-tile
houses with two-story apartment buildings and bought imported
luxury cars.
   Until five years ago, the villagers made more modest livings
from coastal waters rich in catfish and octopus. Offshore oil
exploration and pollution from industrial waste brought an end to
that.
   Pan said Nanliao fishermen got into smuggling after martial law
ended, initially trading Taiwanese consumer goods for fish and
agricultural products from China.
   At first, the villagers exchanged goods with Chinese smugglers
at sea, but the easing of hostility between Taiwan and China
emboldened them to enter mainland ports. Residents of Nanliao said
a boat crew could make nearly $30,000 from a three-day trip.
   ``Villagers first agreed to stay away from guns, drugs and
illegal Chinese immigrants to avoid a harsh crackdown, but the
agreement was broken after more fishing boats joined the trade and
caused prices to fall for smuggled fish and other produce,'' Pan
said.
   Earlier in June, officials seized a ton of Chinese-made
amphetamines with a market value of about $11 million from a
Nanliao fishing boat. Five crewmen were arrested.
   Since the curfew began, only a few Nanliao boats have gone on
smuggling missions. Most have returned with empty holds.
   The government says it will assign about 20,000 soldiers later
this year to help anti-smuggling air, sea and coastal patrols, but
the illegal trade may be difficult to conquer.
   Some Nanliao smugglers are said to have moved to other fishing
ports. Newspapers report smugglers have begun using motorized rafts
to bring goods to shore, leaving pursuing police patrol boats
stranded on sandbars in shallow water.
   The people of Nanliao do not sound defeated. At the temple,
villager Chen Chun-hui said: ``Right now we are living on our
savings, and are watching.''

   Ask Dean Brackley why he is going to El Salvador
to take the place of a murdered priest, why he will give up a
secure life in academia, and he just gazes at the lush campus of
Fordham University.
   ``I need to be close to the struggle for life and death,'' he
says. ``It just isn't happening here.''
   It is happening, he says, in El Salvador, torn by a 10-year
civil war. Among the casualties: six Jesuit priests, taken from
their beds and shot in the back of the head Nov. 16 at the Central
America University.
   ``The murder of the priests affected me deeply,'' said Brackley,
43, one of six priests chosen from around the world to replace
their fallen brothers. He leaves Monday.
   In San Salvador, where he has traveled twice before, Brackley
will teach philosophy and religion to graduate students at the
university and oversee a large rural parish in Jayaque, 45 minutes
west of the city.
   Among the priests chosen by the university and the head of the
Jesuits in Rome is another American _ Charles Beirne, an
administrator at Santa Clara University. The others are a Canadian,
a Mexican, a Spaniard and a Salvadoran.
   ``We know it will be dangerous and we're not going down there to
commit suicide,'' Brackley said. ``But the truth has to be told.''
   The slayings of the Jesuits, their cook and her 16-year-old
daughter underscore the dangers facing hundreds of clerics working
in Salvador's shantytowns.
   Since 1980, when El Salvador's leftist rebels began fighting a
succession of U.S.-backed governments, 72,000 Salvadorans have died
in the war. At least 30,000 died at the hands of right-wing death
squads, human rights groups say.
   Some clerics who work among the dispossessed are viewed as
subversives by the military and conservative government, and as
enemies by the far right, which considers them Marxist ideologues.
Since 1980, 16 _ including Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero _ have
been slain.
   The left-leaning clerics maintain that the civil war arose from
vast social injustice and that only by addressing its causes can it
be resolved. But the armed forces contend the revolution is fueled
by Communist forces outside the country.
   News of the pre-dawn massacre of the Jesuits initially stunned
the world and prompted calls from some U.S. congressmen to
reconsider aid to El Salvador. Eight months later, although an
investigation continues, no soldier has been tried. An officer
never has been convicted of human rights abuse in El Salvador,
which receives $1 million in U.S. aid each day.
   Brackley said he first was struck by the social inequities of
life not in Central America, but in his hometown of Troy, N.Y., a
declining milltown.
   ``As a self-conscious little boy I was stunned by poverty,'' he
recalled. He also recognized early on that he was ``blessed with a
quixotic temperament, given to adventure rather than boredom, even
if it hurts.''
   Brackley joined the Jesuits when he was 18. But after graduating
from Boston College, he had what he termed a ``crisis of faith,''
and went to work on New York City's impoverished Lower East Side.
   There, he learned Spanish and helped found a junior high school
for promising boys from the community.
   In the early 1970s, as he wrestled with the church's role in
society, Brackley met Dorothy Day, the charismatic co-founder of
the Catholic Worker's Movement. He remembers her simple advice to
him: ``Stay close to the people.''
   The encounter with Day taught him ``confusion doesn't clear up
until you make a commitment,'' Brackley said. He said he also
learned he had ``something to contribute to the poor and their
cause.''
   Subsequently, Brackley reaffirmed his commitment to seminary in
Berkeley, Calif. While doing research, he engaged in what he calls
``theological tourism'' _ he worked as a carpenter in Puerto Rico
and studied in Peru.
   It was in Latin America he was introduced to ``liberation
theology,'' the doctrine that champions the poor and oppressed in
countries where mass poverty coexists with the opulence of a tiny
minority. Since it evolved in the 1960s, the doctrine has
splintered the Roman Catholic establishment.
   Brackley returned to the United States and while completing a
doctorate in theology at the University of Chicago, took courses in
political science.
   ``I had found out in Latin America that God was concerned with
suffering,'' he said. ``But what was God's view of the
International Monetary Fund?''
   With a doctorate in hand, Brackley returned to New York and
worked as a priest and organizer for the South Bronx People for
Change, a church-sponsored group that sprang up in 1979 to force
city support for the abandoned community.
   In September, he took a teaching post at Fordham. But Blanca
Ramirez, who heads People for Change, said there are two places
Brackley is truly happy: the South Bronx or El Salvador.
   ``In the South Bronx, I learned how to survive, which meant
having a sense of humor, resilience and humility,'' Brackley said.
``I learned who I was and what my mission was.''

   A bedeviled, beleaguered NASA is hoping
the Magellan spacecraft's rendezvous with Venus next month will
provide our best look yet at Earth's hellishly hot neighbor.
   If all goes according to plan, the $413 million unmanned device,
centerpiece of a $744 million mission, will orbit the
cloud-shrouded planet on Aug. 10 after a 15-month journey from
Earth. And NASA desperately wants everything to go according to
plan.
   ``This thing must succeed because of the Hubble Space Telescope
effect and the generally bad impression we've all been getting of
how NASA has been conducting its affairs lately,'' said Steve
Saunders, the Magellan project's chief scientist.
   But those setbacks _ the crippling of the $1.5 billion Hubble
observatory due to mirror imperfections; the temporary grounding of
the space shuttles due to hydrogen fuel leaks _ have not dimmed the
agency's enthusiasm for Magellan.
   ``We've dreamed about the sights we would see. Now it's about to
happen,'' said Phil Allin, a Magellan project official at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Named for 16th century explorer Ferdinand Magellan, the craft's
radar will penetrate acid-laden Venusian clouds to make pictures
and maps 10 times more detailed than the best previous images.
   That will help geologists understand forces that sculpted Venus
to create flat lowlands, hilly plains and continent-like highlands
capped by peaks such as 35,400-foot Mount Maxwell, which is a mile
taller than Earth's Mount Everest.
   NASA says Magellan's radar will reveal unprecedented details of
the planet's terrain, a landscape shaped by meteorite craters, tens
of thousands of volcanoes, and perhaps movements of gargantuan
blocks of the planet's crust _ a process that may be similar to
continental drift on Earth.
   The 3.7-ton spacecraft also will look for ancient shorelines and
channels to learn if Venus once had oceans and rivers, before its
carbon dioxide atmosphere trapped the sun's heat in a runaway
``greenhouse effect.''
   Such global warming makes modern Venus a bone-dry, 900-degree
Fahrenheit oven with an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than
Earth's.
   Magellan's mission ``is the capstone of the exploration of the
inner planets,'' said Jim Head, a member of the Magellan science
team and a geologist at Brown University in Providence, R.I.
   ``We've seen the surfaces of the moon, Mars, the Earth and
Mercury, but Venus always has been obscured by the clouds and we've
never gotten a good global view of it.''
   The 21-foot-long Magellan was released from the cargo bay of
space shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989, then launched on its
roundabout, 806 million-mile voyage by an inertial upper-stage
rocket.
   At 9:31 a.m. PDT on Aug. 10, Magellan will fire its solid-fueled
Star rocket to slow down and go into a elliptical, nearly polar
orbit that ranges from 171 miles to almost 5,000 miles above Venus.
   After a few weeks of tests, the spacecraft will bounce radar
waves off Venus to make pictures and topographic maps of 70 percent
to 90 percent of the surface. Meanwhile, the planet will rotate
once on its axis during a single Venusian day, which equals 243
Earth days.
   ``It's going to give us a map of Venus that in many ways is
better than anything we have for the whole Earth,'' where most of
the ocean floor hasn't been mapped in detail, Saunders said.
   If scientists are lucky, Magellan may tell them if Venusian
volcanoes are active, if movements of the planet's crust produce
``Venus quakes,'' and if those movements are more like Earth's
drifting continents or like the upward boiling of molten rock that
created Hawaii.
   Venus is the planet most like Earth in terms of size, density
and mass, and also is Earth's nearest neighbor, other than the
moon. Yet its clouds prevent the surface from being seen by
telescopes or optical cameras aboard orbiting spaceships.
   About 20 spacecraft have visited Venus since the early 1960s,
some deploying landers that photographed small parts of the
surface. Pictures also were made by transmitting radar waves from
Earth, and from NASA's Pioneer Venus orbiter in 1978 and the Soviet
Union's Venera 15 and 16 orbiters in 1983.
   But the best radar pictures until now could distinguish only
those landscape features wider than about 1\ miles. Saunders said
Magellan's pictures will be roughly 10 times better, capturing
features as small as 260 yards, about the length of 2{ football
fields.
   Magellan will take 3 hours and 11 minutes to orbit Venus once.
During each orbit, Magellan will spend 37 minutes as it moves from
north to south bouncing radar off a swath of Venus' surface about
10,000 miles long but only 16 miles wide. The information will be
stored on two tape recorders.
   During the rest of each orbit, Magellan will radio the
information back to Earth, where it will be received by
230-foot-wide, dish-shaped antennas at NASA's Deep Space Network
stations in California, Spain and Australia.
   Computers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory will assemble the data
into pictures and topographic maps of each swath. The swaths _
nicknamed ``noodles'' because they are so long and narrow _ then
will be assembled into pictures covering larger areas of the planet.
   ``Mapping a whole new planet will return an enormous amount of
data that will keep geologists busy for a long time,'' Saunders
said. ``If you printed it in books, it would fill a shelf about 10
miles long. It's very humbling.''
   Magellan's main 243-day mapping mission will miss the south
polar regions. NASA is expected to approve more 243-day mapping
cycles. A total of three are needed to map the entire planet.
   Cost of the Magellan mission through the first 243-day mapping
cycle is $744 million, including the cost of launching the
spacecraft from the shuttle, said Bill Dimmer of NASA's
comptroller's office in Washington. The spacecraft and its
instruments account for $413 million of that total, he said.

   Here are key facts about the Magellan
spacecraft, which is scheduled to go into orbit around Venus in
August:
   PRIMARY MISSION: To use radar to penetrate the clouds of Venus
and make pictures and maps of 70 percent to 90 percent of the
planet's surface with 10 times better detail than any previous
images. Magellan will reveal signs of forces that shaped the
planet, including volcanism, meteorite impacts and possibly wind,
water and large-scale movements of the planet's crust.
   EXTENDED MISSION: A single Venusian day _ the time it takes the
planet to rotate once on its axis _ lasts 243 Earth days.
Magellan's primary mission is to map the planet as it rotates once
below the polar-orbiting spacecraft. But NASA scientists expect to
obtain approval for additional 243-day mapping cycles so they can
make pictures and maps of most of the surface. The primary mission
will miss the planet's southernmost latitudes.
   COST: $744 million through the end of Magellan's primary 243-day
mapping effort, including $413 million for the spacecraft and its
instruments. NASA cut costs by building Magellan using some spare
parts from Voyager and Galileo spacecraft.
   LAUNCH: Deployed from cargo bay of space shuttle Atlantis on May
4, 1989, then launched by an inertial upper stage booster.
   THE VOYAGE: A 806 million-mile trip to Venus in 15 months,
requiring 1{ loops around the sun.
   PROPULSION: A solid-fueled Star 48B rocket is to put Magellan
into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10. Twenty-four liquid-fueled
thrusters help point the spacecraft and adjust its trajectory.
   ORBIT: Magellan will orbit near Venus' poles once every 3 hours
and 11 minutes, at an altitude ranging from 171 miles to almost
5,000 miles.
   VITAL STATISTICS: Magellan is 21 feet long and 15 feet in
diameter, and weighs 7,410 pounds.
   INSTRUMENTS: Synthetic aperture radar is to send radar waves and
catch the reflected waves to make two-dimensional pictures of
Venus, measure elevations for topographic maps, and determine heat
emissions from Venus' surface to provide clues about surface
roughness and rock composition. Engineers on Earth will precisely
track Magellan's speed to measure changes in the strength of the
gravity field on various parts of Venus. That will yield clues
about the planet's interior.
   POWER SUPPLY: A pair of solar panels charge the spacecraft's two
nickel-cadmium batteries.
   COMMUNICATIONS: Magellan's 12-foot antenna dish radios
information back to 230-foot, dish-shaped antennas in Spain,
Australia and Goldstone, Calif. The radar information will be
relayed to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.,
where it will be assembled into maps and pictures.
   CONSTRUCTION: NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory managed the
project. Martin Marietta Corp. built the spacecraft in Denver.
Hughes Aircraft Co. built the radar in El Segundo, Calif.

   After the Magellan spacecraft goes into
orbit around Venus on Aug. 10, it will use radar to map the surface
of the cloud-covered planet. Here is some of what scientists
already know about the second planet from the sun:
   DIAMETER: About 7,520 miles, or 95 percent as wide as Earth;
sixth largest of the solar system's nine known planets.
   MASS: Venus weighs about 82 percent as much as Earth.
   ATMOSPHERE: About 97 percent carbon dioxide, with trace amounts
of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, water vapor, argon, oxygen, carbon
monoxide, neon, and hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids. The
planet's clouds contain sulfuric acid droplets. The atmosphere
traps heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that scientists
believe evaporated liquid water long ago, if there ever was any on
the planet. Large fluctuations in sulfur dioxide levels may
indicate that active volcanoes pump the gas into Venus' atmosphere.
   SURFACE CONDITIONS: Temperature about 900 degrees Fahrenheit,
hot enough to melt lead, zinc or tin. Crushing atmospheric pressure
90 times that on Earth's surface, or equivalent to the pressure
2,700 feet beneath the surface of an ocean on Earth.
   THE CALENDAR: A day on Venus lasts longer than a year. A
Venusian year _ the time it takes for the planet to orbit the sun _
lasts 225 Earth days. A Venusian day _ the time the planet takes to
spin once on its axis _ lasts 243 Earth days. Venus also has
retrograde rotation, so the sun rises in the west and sets in the
east.
   DISTANCE FROM THE SUN: Venus is the second planet from the sun,
orbiting at a distance of 67.2 million miles. It is closer to Earth
than any other planet. Other than the sun and moon, Venus is the
brightest object in Earth's skies.
   MOONS: None.
   GEOLOGY: Earth-based and spacecraft radar revealed hundreds of
thousands of volcanoes on the Venusian lowlands, although
scientists don't yet know if any are active. Venus also has
meteorite impact craters and continent-like highlands with towering
peaks that dwarf Earth's tallest mountains. Scientists suspect
giant plates of rock may move in Venus' crust in a process vaguely
like continental drift on Earth. Venus' surface is about 65 percent
rolling plains, 27 percent flat lowlands and 8 percent highlands
that may be similar to Earth's continents.
   GRAVITY: About 89 percent as strong as on Earth.
   MAGNETIC FIELD: None detected so far, suggesting Venus now lacks
a liquid core, which is needed to generate a magnetic field.

   Southerners mostly scorn the boll
weevil. Here, they built a monument in the varmint's honor.
   Like others across the Cotton Belt, many in Coffee County were
ruined when the insatiable beetle's migration reached here 75 years
ago. But people in Enterprise came to see the weevil as ``the
herald of prosperity,'' in the words of the monument's inscription,
because its ravages forced farmers to abandon a one-crop economy
and begin growing peanuts, corn and other crops.
   ``It meant that cotton was no longer king,'' said Roy Shoffner,
a retired newspaper publisher and local historian. His book about
the monument, built in 1919, quotes an official on the lesson
learned: ``There is one and only one weapon of defense ..., and
that's diversified farming.''
   But nowadays there's talk of another weapon, of a frontal
insecticide assault to eradicate the bug, to evict it over the
Mexican border it crossed nearly a century ago.
   ``We're trying to squeeze the weevil out,'' says T. Cotton
Nelson of the National Cotton Council in Memphis, Tenn. ``Hopefully
... drive him right back out of the country.''
   American agriculture's most destructive pest could be eliminated
as a threat within the decade, says the cotton council's director
of technical operations, Andrew Jordan. That, he cautions, is ``in
an ideal world,'' but he adds after some reflection, ``I think the
year 2000 is probably realistic.''
   Environmentalists and some cotton farmers themselves are not
convinced.
   After all, the boll weevil has proved its durability while
changing a way of life in the South. Many areas simply surrendered
to the creature. They gave up growing the white fiber whose profits
had helped finance the pageant of the antebellum days and whose
production was the region's signature, the Land of Cotton.
   ``Boll Weevil Coming Fast,'' the People's Ledger warned Coffee
County's farmers in 1910. The census that year recorded a bumper
cotton crop, 25,207 bales. In 1916, a year after the weevil
arrived, only 1,500 bales were ginned in Enterprise.
   Elsewhere it was no different. In 1921, the boll weevil, which
devours cotton bolls and buds, went through 30 percent of the
South's crop.
   A folk song tried to make light of the pest.
   ``First time I saw the boll weevil, he was standin' on the
square.
   ``Next time I saw the boll weevil, he had his whole family there.
   ``They was lookin' for a home,
   ``Just lookin' for a home.''
   Over time, a variety of control measures, from insecticides to
penny-a-bug bounties, helped limit damage. In Enterprise, Clayton
Metcalf sold a vacuum-type machine called a Nesbitt Bug-Catcher.
   ``It helped,'' he recalls, ``but you couldn't get 'em all.''
   Even today, crop losses and control costs amount to $300 million
a year _ and the bill comes to $12 billion altogether since the
weevil entered Texas in 1892, the cotton council estimates.
   So there was a mixture of hope and skepticism when the U.S.
Department of Agriculture launched an experimental ``eradication''
effort in a small area of Virginia and North Carolina in 1978.
   ``Fear No Weevil'' became the project's unofficial motto.
   Instead of farm-by-farm measures, it used an area approach.
Working from weevil-free zones, the pilot program applied weekly
doses of insecticide from September to the first frost to reduce
the number of ``over-wintering'' weevils. In spring, bug traps
revealed surviving populations, which were sprayed. After the third
year, program officials merely mopped up spot re-infestations.
   The pilot program was expanded to all of North and South
Carolina in 1983, with farmers and the government sharing costs.
   ``It's quite clear that biologically it was successful,'' says
Gerald Carlson, an agricultural economics professor at North
Carolina State University who studied the program. ``And
economically what resulted was some fairly substantial savings to
the farmers _ and to new farmers getting into it. There's been a
big expansion in acreage.''
   While U.S. cotton production rose only 10 percent between 1980
and '89, from 11.1 million to 12.2 million bales, North Carolina's
nearly tripled, from 52,000 to 141,000 bales.
   ``In North and South Carolina, the boll weevil has been
eradicated as an economic pest of cotton,'' the National Cotton
Council said in a 1989 report.
   Further, ``results in the Southwest (Arizona and Southern
California) eradication program are equally impressive. Weevil
populations fell approximately 95 percent in the first year ... The
containment program also is working in Texas,'' the council said,
referring to the High Plains growing area near Lubbock. USDA also
lists Virginia within the eradicated zone.
   Is the weevil finally on the run then, as the eradication effort
continues in Georgia, northern Florida and southern Alabama?
   It's not that simple. First, even now less than 1 million acres
of the 12 million-acre U.S. cotton crop are under the eradication
and containment programs, says Jordan of the cotton council.
   Second, there's been active resistance to expansion.
   Farmers in Alabama this spring voted down a proposed eradication
assessment increase when program officials concluded that more had
to be spent in areas where winter cold was less an ally in the
weevil war than it was in the Carolinas. In a second vote in June
they approved the increase.
   Environmentalists also fought the plan. ``We just didn't feel
that that made environmental sense, a massive malathion spraying
program, especially by air,'' says Jim Taylor of the Alabama
chapter of the Sierra Club. Cars and homes were accidentally
sprayed with the pesticide, he said.
   The group sued, along with the Alabama Conservancy and the
Southern Environmental Law Center. Under a resulting 1988
agreement, the government is drafting an environmental impact
statement and is now spraying with what Taylor calls ``more
benign'' pesticides.
   Supporters of the eradication effort insist one of its benefits
is a long-term reduction in pesticide use as weevil populations
dwindle.
   Without the program, ``20 years from now you're going to be
spraying just as much as you are now,'' says Robroy Fisher, a
Mississippi Delta cotton planter who is active in weevil control
efforts.
   Taylor dismisses the effort as ``voodoo science.'' And the goal
of eradicating the perennial pest? Says Taylor, ``I'll bet on the
boll weevil.''
   In Coffee County, they're not taking any bets. People know of
the eradication program, and they know cotton acreage is up some.
But, says county agent Dan Presley, ``I don't think cotton'll ever
come back as king.''
   Peanuts and corn are the main crops here now. The weevil's
lesson about diversification remains, whether the bug does or not.

   Gubernatorial candidate Gatewood
Galbraith wants to put the law back on the side of a Kentucky
agricultural tradition: growing marijuana.
   ``Our granddaddies used to grow it by the thousands of acres''
when marijuana was legal and grown mainly for fiber for rope and
textiles, said Galbraith, a 43-year-old Lexington attorney.
   Galbraith, a long shot in next year's Kentucky race for
governor, is among a handful of pro-legalization candidates who
consider themselves political trailblazers for millions of
Americans who smoke pot regularly.
   They also style themselves as champions for the taxpayers who
are footing the bill for the nation's war on drugs.
   In New Hampshire, congressional candidate Michael Weddle is
challenging voters to heed their state motto _ ``Live Free or Die''
_ by supporting marijuana legalization. Weddle, a state
representative, is among eight candidates in a GOP primary for an
open U.S. House seat.
   In Kansas, Democratic congressional candidate Mark Creamer now
operates his pro-legalization campaign from a jail cell, where he
is serving a six-month sentence for lighting a marijuana cigarette
in a police station. Creamer is given little chance against
Democratic Rep. Jim Slattery in the state's Aug. 7 primary.
   Kevin Zeese, vice president of the private, pro-legalization
Drug Policy Foundation in Washington, said several other
major-party candidates also are carrying the marijuana legalization
banner this year.
   Zeese said incumbent officeholders who support marijuana
legalization and are running for re-election include U.S. Rep.
George Crockett, D-Mich.; Democratic state Rep. Elbert Walton in
Missouri; Democratic state Sen. Joe Galiber in New York; and Bill
Mathesius, the Republican county executive in Mercer County, N.J.
   Zeese believes the political winds have changed since the
conservative tide swept the nation during the 1980s, dousing the
marijuana legalization debates of the 1960s and 1970s.
   ``Some politicians are starting to get ahead of the curve on
this,'' Zeese said. ``Something like this was unspeakable three
years ago and now people are running for office on it.''
   Supporters of legalization include conservatives such as
economist Milton Friedman and columnist William F. Buckley Jr.
Other proponents are former Attorney General Ramsey Clark,
Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke and U.S. District Judge Robert W.
Sweet in New York. Former Secretary of State George Shultz has said
legalization should at least be considered.
   Many supporters of legalization say marijuana is less potent and
addictive than cigarettes or alcohol, and shouldn't be grouped with
cocaine, heroin, crack or other hard drugs. They also contend
legalizing marijuana would be a big weapon against crime syndicates
that control the drug world.
   But federal drug czar William Bennett has branded legalization
as ``stupid and morally atrocious.''
   ``It doesn't make any sense,'' Bennett has said. ``It is
becoming something of a fashion to believe this (legalization) in
certain circles of opinion. But even though it's fashionable, it's
still every bit as dumb and compassionless as it was before.''
   Dewey Stokes, the national president of the Fraternal Order of
Police, said legalizing marijuana would prompt more people to
develop drug habits and increase demand for harder drugs.
   ``I think the anti-drug effort has to be successful if we're
going to have a country,'' he said.
   Kentucky Democratic leaders have taken steps recently to
distance themselves from Galbraith and a newly formed grass-roots
organization called the ``Green Democrats.''
   Galbraith, Weddle and Creamer all face long odds at the polls
this year. But legalization supporters express confidence their
numbers will grow as opposition mounts to the costs of a federal
anti-drug policy they deem ineffective.
   ``As the repression continues and the erosion of civil liberties
continue ... so will the awareness that solving the problem with a
drug war is not the solution,'' said Weddle, a two-term state House
member from Portsmouth, N.H.
   Weddle, a Democrat who turned Republican for the September
primary, said voter response has been better than he anticipated.
   In Kentucky, where marijuana outstrips tobacco as the leading _
albeit illegal _ cash crop, Galbraith said the response has been
``absolutely stunning'' to his proposal to strictly regulate and
tax marijuana.
   Galbraith, who is among five announced or likely candidates for
the Democratic nomination for governor next year, estimates the
state could reap up to $1 billion in taxes each year from legal
marijuana.
   He said Kentucky was the nation's leading producer of marijuana
_ which was commonly called hemp _ for a century before it was
banned in 1936.
   John Dunlap, a spokesman for the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws in Washington, said legalizing marijuana
would generate $40 billion a year nationally. Billions more could
be saved by scrapping local, state and federal eradication efforts,
he said.

   After $30 million of repairs, the Exxon Valdez
is due back at sea in August with a new crew, new steel in its
shredded hull, new ports of call in the Middle East and a new name
_ Exxon Mediterranean. But no such industrywide makeover has
occurred to limit oil spills and their damage.

<TEXT>
   It seemed like a maritime version of Murphy's
law.
   The wayward Exxon Valdez plowed into Bligh Reef. Then three
shipwrecks oiled three waterways within 12 hours last June.
   The American Trader ran over its anchor and gashed itself. The
BT Nautilus was one of three spills in three months in the New York
City area. The Mega Borg caught fire in the Gulf of Mexico. And on
and on and on.
   But these accidents, all within 15 months of each other, are
more than just a run of bad luck. Systemwide flaws in the way
tankers are built, operated and monitored contribute to accidents,
according to records and interviews with industry experts.
   On an average of five days out of seven last year, a tanker ran
aground, hit another ship or a dock, broke apart, sprung a leak,
exploded or had some other kind of mishap, according to Coast Guard
records.
   A Coast Guard report on tanker safety cited ``formidable
problems'' in regulating tankers. Among them are fatigued tanker
crews, shipowners who give more priority to schedules than safety
and inspectors who are overworked and burned out.
   The Center for Marine Conservation has called for a presidential
task force to assess tanker safety because no agency is doing a
top-to-bottom review. It also criticized cutbacks in the Coast
Guard as ``false economizing.''
   And despite the Exxon Valdez wreck that caused the nation's
worst oil spill on March 24, 1989, the industry remains
ill-prepared to handle a major spill and a glacial-paced Congress
still hasn't passed a tanker safety package.
   The result is bleak news for a nation whose gluttonous appetite
for oil means more tankers, many of them aging, will be pulling
into its ports. On any given day, about 50 tankers carrying 450
million gallons of oil sail into U.S. harbors, each one a potential
environmental disaster.
   ``We are asking for trouble,'' said Clifton Curtis, president of
the Oceanic Society.
   And not just environmentalists are uneasy.
   ``This industry is in a bad way,'' said Arthur MacKenzie, head
of the Tanker Advisory Group and a former Exxon Corp. shipping
executive. ``We have to make drastic changes in the way we build,
operate and license in this business.
   ``Who's studying the whole picture? Nobody.''
   In sheer numbers, the Coast Guard investigated 265 oil spills
from tankers last year, an average of five a week. Most were minor,
but six were more than 10,000 gallons, including the 11 million
gallons disgorged by the Exxon Valdez.
   Add last year's 639 tank barge incidents, and the average is 17
a week.
   A private study by Golob's Oil Pollution Bulletin in Cambridge,
Mass., counted 78 spills of 10,000 gallons or more in the past 12
years, an average of nearly seven a year.
   Total spillage was 41 million gallons. At the same time, 243
billion gallons, or 99.98 percent of the oil shipped, got to shore
safely.
   The oil industry says that record hardly supports the image of
an oceanic demolition derby. But six major spills have occurred
already this year. And the public, as much as it demands the oil,
won't tolerate the sliming of beaches and shorelines.
   ``What was an acceptable level of performance 10 years ago is
not acceptable today,'' said Sean Connaughton of the American
Petroleum Institute. ``There's an almost zero tolerance for oil
spills. The sensitivity is so much greater now.''
   Environmentalists say the breakdowns are not isolated incidents
but examples of common problems, the way Three Mile Island was in
the nuclear power industry and the Challenger explosion was in the
space industry.
   ``Clearly, this is an issue that has reached and will exceed
crisis proportions. The potential for an increasing number and more
severe accidents is very high,'' said Roger McManus, president of
the Center for Marine Conservation.
   ``What we have on the seas is something we wouldn't put up with
in air traffic,'' he said. ``It desperately needs attention.''
   Turning things around is trickier than steering a supertanker in
a tight channel. There is no one solution because there is no one
problem, and no one agency who can fix it.
   Each branch of Congress passed its own version of an oil tanker
safety bill last fall. But a 100-member conference named to
reconcile the differences had met just once before the Mega Borg
exploded June 9 and leaked 3.9 million gallons of oil.
   On July 12, the committee reached a compromise that would
require new tankers be built with puncture-resistant double hulls
whileexisting tankers be fitted with a second hull or phased out of
service over the next 20 years.
   In addition, the bill would create a $1 billion oil spill
response fund, make it easier for the Coast Guard to take over
cleanup efforts, set liability levels for spills and toughen
licensing requirements for tanker crew members.
   A final vote is pending.

   Meanwhile, the Coast Guard motto is ``Semper Paratus'' or
``Always Prepared.'' But in an interview, its commandant said the
service would be better suited to live up to its motto if Congress
acts.
   ``There is more that can be done. We're less prepared without
this bill,'' conceded Adm. J. William Kime. ``We need to do
everything we can to minimize the probability we're going to have a
spill and then maximize our ability to limit the impact of the
pollution.''
   The Coast Guard, in a 44-page report by its Tanker Safety Study
Group, said a review of tanker operations has not been done in 10
years.
   Among the highlights of the report, distributed last fall to all
admirals, were:
   Tankers are being driven harder and faster by shipowners more
concerned with schedules than safety; the Coast Guard pays too much
attention to owners' desires to make money and too little attention
to safety; Coast Guard inspectors are overworked and burned out by
a ``dirty and tiring job,'' and their training is inadequate;
tankers are built with 18 percent less steel than in the 1970s;
newer ships are so big only 20 percent of the inside of their cargo
tanks are inspected.
   The report said the best way to avoid shipwrecks is having
competent crews, because human error plays a part in 90 percent of
the groundings and collisions and 75 percent of the fires and
explosions.
   Cuts in the number of crew have ``severely impaired'' routine
maintenance, the report said. And relying on automation and
machines as a cure-all ``misses the point and provides a false
sense of security.''
   Fatigue is also factor. When Coast Guard inspectors met with
chief mates to set up inspections, ``some mates were so exhausted
they fell asleep during these meetings.''
   The Center for Marine Conservation did its own study called
``Shipping Safety and America's Coasts.'' It urged presidential
action and assailed Congress for not giving the Coast Guard the
money and manpower to do its job right.
   ``Our coasts deserve a better defense than they are getting from
false economizing,'' said the center's Michael Weber.
   The center said better radar used in other parts of the world
could be used in domestic ports for less than the cost of a
cleaning up a good-sized spill. Exxon has spent $2 billion on the
Valdez cleanup.
   In Valdez, the Coast Guard cut the power on its radar and
reduced crew sizes for budget reasons. The Exxon Valdez was off the
screen when it crashed. Foreign ports have radar that beeps an
alarm if a ship strays from its channel. In another cost-cutting
move, the Coast Guard cut out vessel traffic systems in New York
and New Orleans. The system, used in five ocean ports, allows
mariners to see beyond blind corners and keep up to date on what
other ships are doing. But other countries have better systems.
   At Sullom Voe, Europe's largest oil and gas terminal operated by
British Petroleum Co. in Scotland's Shetland Islands, licensed
pilots instead of technicians work at radar screens to steer
tankers past reefs and hazards.
   ``The existing vessel traffic services in the U.S. are far from
state of the art,'' said Richard Townsend, who did the study for
the Center for Marine Conservation. ``Much better systems currently
are available, using off-the-shelf technology that is vastly
superior to that currently used by the Coast Guard.''
   In the private sector, 20 oil companies formed the Petroleum
Industry Response Organization last year. The group would set up
five regional centers covering 24 coastal states that would act as
gigantic fire houses with booms, skimmers and oil dispersants.
   But the organization is waiting for Congress before it buys any
equipment.
   ``The void that existed when the Exxon Valdez had its accident
still exists as far as cleanup is concerned,'' said retired Adm.
John Costello, who heads the group. ``We don't own any ships or any
booms yet.''

<HEAD>Double Hulls Create Controversy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Troubled Waters, b0797-b0798</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A double hull creates a ship within a ship. It
is two layers of steel, separated by a gap of air, around the sides
and bottom of an oil tanker as an extra layer of protection.
   Environmental groups, in a letter to a congressional committee
this month, said requiring double-hull tankers was ``the single
most important step Congress can take to prevent oil spills.''
   A compromise is pending in Congress to have two hulls on new
tankers and to retrofit or phase out single-hulled tankers within
20 years. The House originally wanted a 15-year timetable while the
Senate asked for more study.
   ``A double hull is not a be-all or end-all. But we've got to
build redundancy into the system,'' said Clifton Curtis, president
of the Oceanic Society.
   Curtis called the compromise ``a signficant victory.'' But he
added: ``We are sorely displeased with the fact that the retrofit
schedule is not more rapid.''
   Advocates of double hulls say they would limit the impact of oil
spills if a tanker runs aground, because a reef or man-made object
would have to gash both layers to spill oil.
   A Coast Guard study of 30 tanker groundings between 1969 and
1973 said 96 percent of the spills would have been averted if the
vessels had double hulls.
   A double hull would not have prevented the Exxon Valdez spill,
but some studies say less crude oil would have fouled Prince
William Sound in the nation's worst oil spill.
   ``Double hulls are an extra margin of safety to prevent or
minimize marine accidents,'' said U.S. Coast Guard Commandant J.
William Kime.
   But critics say double hulls also may have drawbacks. Water can
rush in between layers of the steel and make a ship settle lower,
thereby leaking more oil. There are also fears explosive vapors
could gather between the gaps.
   Double hulls are also more expensive. It would have cost 10
percent to 15 percent more to build a double hull on the $125
million Exxon Valdez. Its damaged hull was repaired with 3,000 tons
of new steel, but it still doesn't have a double hull.
   Retrofitting the 153 U.S. tankers at $30 million each would cost
$4.6 billion; the same work on 900 foreign-flagged tankers could be
as high as $10 billion, industry officials said.
   But the oil industry believes the debate is misdirected.
   ``If an airplane crashes into a mountain, we don't build planes
that can withstand the impact. We try to find out why and prevent
it from happening again,'' said Sean Connaughton of the American
Petroleum Institute.
   ``If we have ships running into underwater mountains, we end up
with people calling for ships that can withstand that type of
collision,'' Connaughton said.
   Meanwhile, some companies aren't waiting for Congress.
   Houston-based Conoco Inc. ordered two double-hull tankers in
April and said it would order double-hull ships in the future.
   Norway's Statoil, the largest producer of North Sea crude oil,
said in June that it was ordering five new tankers, two with double
hulls and three with double or partial double bottoms.

from small businesses, economist William Dunkelberg said declines
were noted in all but two of 10 components of a so-called optimism
index.
   The index, produced for the National Federation of Independent
Business, declined to a reading of 100.1, six-tenths of a point
below its year-ago reading and more than two points below June
readings in 1986, 1987 and 1988.
   The report confirms the weakness observed in other business
surveys, but it found little evidence among federation members that
a credit squeeze was responsible.
   However, Dunkelberg, dean of Temple University's school of
business in Philadelphia, said only 35 percent of reporting
companies said they were regular borrowers, a near record low for
the survey, which was begun in 1974.
   The index is based on a formula that includes plans, opinions
and hard data on factors such as expected business conditions,
expected sales volume, the climate for expansion, job openings, and
hiring and spending plans.
   The study found declines in plans for capital spending, hiring
and investment in larger inventories. The labor market weakened
slightly, but both the pace of price increases and plans to raise
prices declined.
   The June optimism reading was also the lowest of 1990, although
slightly lower readings were measured last October, November and
December.
   While the optimism index measures results and attitudes of
mostly small businesses _ although ``small'' can mean companies
with more than $100 million in sales _ some economy watchers feel
it is a responsive grass-roots tool.
   Dunkelberg notes, for example, that the business community
represented by the survey employs about one-half the private
non-farm work force and produces about 50 percent of the nation's
gross private sector product.
   Using 1978 as its base of 100, the index plunged to a quarterly
low of just 81.1 in the second quarter of 1980, but rebounded even
more sharply to 95.1 in the third quarter of that year, foretelling
the rise from recession.
   By 1983, the index was regularly over 100, reaching an all-time
high of 108.7 in the first quarter of 1984. Since the second
quarter of 1984 it has wavered between 99.5 and 102.7.
   While the survey found no evidence of a credit crunch, it found
suggestions of tighter lending practices, causing Dunkelberg to
comment that while ``there is more selectivity, this should be
expected at the peak of a business cycle.''
   He observed that projects that may have looked good to lenders
at the beginning of the expansion might not appear to have the same
promise late in the expansion, especially in real estate
development.
   ``Thus, with the same standards, projects that were accepted
earlier will now be turned down,'' he said.

   Three dozen teen-agers from across the nation
witnessed firsthand Monday the noisy collision of supply and demand.
   ``It looks like chaos,'' 14-year-old Tara Powell, from
Northeastern High School in Elizabeth City, N.C., said as she
watched traders at the Chicago Board of Trade try to fit the two
sides of the economic equation together.
   She was one of 36 high school students who showed a special
acumen in the futures markets along with their economics classes.
The students got a free trip to Chicago and a look at how futures
trading is really done.
   In simulated trading during the school year, Miss Powell made a
profit of $16,860 in the gold futures market.
   ``It was an eye-opener,'' she said, standing beside the crowded
corn pit as prices plunged 3 cents to 4 cents lower from Friday's
close. Around her, order forms fluttered to the floor from traders'
hands, ready to be scooped up by runners who hustle the buy and
sell orders back to computer terminals.
   Like her fellow students, Miss Powell was entranced by the noise
and fast pace.
   ``You get to let loose and yell a lot,'' she said. ``But you've
got to know what you're doing.''
   Each of the students was assigned to a trader, who was supposed
to explain what was going on.
   Trader Joel Jacobson, amid the din of the corn pit, took a
minute out to give some pointers to Bruce Bishop, 15, of Beaumont
Junior High School in Lexington, Ky.
   Jacobson had a hand full of forms and wads of paperwork were
jammed into the half dozen pockets in his jacket. He looked like a
walking file cabinet.
   ``This is an order for 5,000 bushels of corn,'' Jacobson said,
pointing to a few squiggles on a piece of paper. ``But the price
looked too good, so I sent it back for confirmation and the
customer said `buy', so we bought.''
   ``Five thousands bushels of corn sold just like that, no fuss,
no muss,'' he told his student.
   ``I love it,'' Bishop said. ``It's a tense situation, but it
never gets boring.''
   A few minutes later Jacobson was asked about a detail of the
5,000-bushel corn trade.
   ``I don't remember anything about it,'' he said. ``It's 10:21
a.m., that was 10:18 a.m. so it's ancient history.''
   Another student, Carmen Barrus, 18, of Los Alamos High School in
New Mexico, made $30,000 in her hypothetical trading of sugar
futures, but the real trading pits had a special appeal.
   ``Wow!'' she said. ``It's very exciting. It's something new
every day!''
   All the students had heard about the indictments last year of 48
people involved in futures trading at the Chicago Board of Trade
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   None of the teens questioned about this seemed troubled by the
allegations of fraud.
   ``The corruption doesn't seem very widespread,'' said Miss
Powell, indicating she wouldn't be concerned about being sullied if
she sought a career in futures.
   ``It's a personal thing,'' she said. ``You don't just get
corrupted. If something is against the law, you just don't do it.''

<HEAD>Judge Orders Class Action in Nation's Asbestos Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a dramatic step aimed at easing backlogs in
the nation's court dockets, a federal judge has ordered
consolidation of more than 100,000 liability cases involving
workers killed or injured handling asbestos.
   The ruling Monday by Thomas D. Lambros, chief judge of U.S.
District Court in Cleveland, comes amid mounting problems with a
trust set up by Manville Corp. to compensate victims of
asbestos-related diseases such as lung cancer.
   Lambros said he issued the order because thousands of victims
nationwide could go uncompensated as companies that made asbestos
products were or could become unable to pay millions of dollars in
asbestos liability.
   Plaintiffs lawyers said they expected the order to be opposed
and challenged in a federal appeals court. ``Each victim doesn't
get their day in court,'' said Perry Weitz, a New York lawyer
handling hundreds of cases.
   All cases filed under the umbrella of a class action are bound
by a single court judgment, eliminating individual trials and
out-of-court settlements. But class action also raises the
possibility of an adverse ruling for all victims.
   The move pre-empted similar action threatened by U.S. District
Judge Jack B. Weinstein in Brooklyn, who has sought to take charge
of fixing the financially ailing Manville trust fund and clearing
the asbestos backlog.
   Weinstein last week ordered the trust to halt all payments to
victims until he receives a proposal on Aug. 6 to restructure and
refinance the trust, which was created in 1988 as part of
Manville's bankruptcy court reorganization.
   The trust is out of cash to pay new claims and has said people
who file claims now may not be compensated until well into the next
century.
   Asbestos-related cases form the largest number of personal
injury lawsuits in the country. Lambros said more than 100,000
claims have been filed in federal and state courts nationwide. Some
cases aren't scheduled for trial until the late 1990s, while
thousands of others await resolution with the Manville trust.
   Several dozen companies that made asbestos products and the
Manville trust, which is legally separate from the company, are
defendants in the cases.
   In a four-page order, Lambros said the asbestos litigation meets
the requirement for creating a class action because ``there are
insufficient funds among all of the defendants to pay all
meritorious claims'' and the cost of litigation.
   The judge said that since 1982, Manville and several other
companies have sought bankruptcy court protection because of
thousands of lawsuits seeking asbestos compensation, while other
companies are ``approaching the brink of bankruptcy.''
   Lambros said the Cleveland court has 7,000 asbestos personal
injury cases with more than 13,000 claims pending, the nation's
largest concentration of cases.
   Manville once was the nation's largest maker of asbestos, which
was used widely for decades because of its natural heat-resistance
and insulation properties. It later was identified as carcinogenic.
   Manville, based in Denver, emerged from Chapter 11 proceedings
in 1988 and no longer makes asbestos.
   The trust so far has spent $974 million in settling the first
22,000 cases at an average of $43,509 a claim, well above initial
estimates of $25,000 per settlement. Some 130,000 claims are
pending but the trust expects no new funds until late 1991.
   The main criticism of the trust is that it processes claims on
the basis of when they are filed, rather than the nature of the
disease or the victim's need. The system is expected to be altered
under the reorganization ordered by Weinstein.
   Lambros said his order establishing a class action could be
changed only by a decision from a recently formed committee of
judges with the nation's largest asbestos dockets. The order also
establishes sub-classes of exisiting cases to be managed and
processed in state and federal courts.
   A Manville trust spokeswoman declined to comment on the court
order.
   Last week, Weinstein supported but did not order consolidation
of asbestos litigation into a class action, instead ordering an
overhaul of the trust.
   But Weinstein said creating a class action could ``maximize a
prompt, fair recovery to all claimants under a final settlement
involving all parties _ the trust, claimants, the corporation and
other defendant companies.''
   He said cases now being settled or tried could be excluded from
the mandatory class. The judge also proposed a parallel
registration system for less urgent claims by victims presently
without symptoms.

<HEAD>GAO Study: Better Safeguards Needed on Financial Planners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional study says investors should
not be misled into believing personal financial advisers are
closely watched by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Investment advisers and financial planners must register with
the SEC and submit to periodic review if they advise on securities
or issue analyses of securities.
   But the SEC doesn't guarantee that investment advisers know what
they're doing.
   A study by the General Accounting Office released Monday found
that the SEC was behind in reviewing registered advisers. When
advisers are reviewed, usually only inadequate disclosure or
record-keeping problems are uncovered and the SEC does little to
ensure deficiencies are corrected, the report said.
   Under the 1940 Investment Advisers Act, the SEC requires
investmentadvisers to register with the agency and submit to
periodic review. Information submitted at registration is not
verified until the first review, which could take up to a year or
more, the GAO report said.
   ``SEC's oversight of investment advisers provides investors
little assurance that the information they receive from advisers is
accurate or that advisers operate in accordance with'' the law,
according to the GAO study.
   The SEC, however, noted that to implement the report's
recommendations would require tripling the staff now devoted to
investment adviser review.
   The GAO, the accounting arm of Congress, warned that current law
_ unless improved _ ``may be doing more harm than good'' by lulling
investors into a false sense of security ``that SEC-registered
advisers have a `seal of approval.'''
   The study noted that one investor who lost her life savings of
$60,000 said she had been ``impressed'' that the investment adviser
was registered with the SEC. The investor was not identified in the
report.
   In a letter attached to the report, SEC officials said they do
not have enough money and people to adequately regulate the
financial advice industry.
   ``Recently, between 2,000 and 3,000 new advisers have registered
annually. To inspect all new registrants within one year of
registration would require a very large increase in staff
resources,'' Kathryn B. McGrath, who was then head of the SEC's
Division of Investment Management, wrote the GAO in an April 23
letter.
   She noted that the average SEC examiner is able to complete
about 25 inspections a year and in 1990, the current division staff
of 53 expects to complete about 1,330 examinations.
   A hearing on the issue is scheduled for Wednesday before the
House Energy and Commerce Committee's finance subcommittee, which
requested the GAO study.
   Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., a member of the subcommittee, has
submitted a bill that would require anyone offering investment
advice for pay to register with the SEC and provide clients with
accurate information. The bill also would give customers the right
to sue for damages when they lose money because of violations of
the law.
   ``This report sounds a warning bell for the millions of
Americans who consult financial planners each year,'' Boucher said
in a statement issued jointly with Reps. Edward Markey, D-Mass.,
and Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio.
   Last year, the SEC submitted legislation that would farm out
investment adviser oversight to a self-regulatory organization like
the National Association of Securities Dealers. That has yet to be
acted on.
   The GAO study noted that since 1980, the number of investment
advisers has tripled to about 14,000 while the assets they manage
have increased from $440 billion 10 years ago to about $4.6
trillion today.
   While the amount of fraud and abuse reported to date has been
relatively small compared to the amount of assets managed, the GAO
worried that the three-fold increase in the number of people
providing financial advice and the 10-fold increase in assets
managed ``raises the risk that fraud and abuse will occur and the
potential that any amounts lost could be large.''

   Savings and loan bailout officials hope to
speed the sale of distressed real estate and sour loans by mixing
them with more attractive assets in multimillion-dollar packages.
   A Bush administration board overseeing the bailout approved the
new sales technique on a trial basis Monday. The Resolution Trust
Corp. Oversight Board, headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady, authorized bulk sales totaling $2 billion.
   The agency overseen by the board will put together portfolios of
similar assets such as commercial loans, commmrcial real estate,
apartment properties or apartment loans. The packages will include
both good and problem assets.
   Ed Kane, Ohio State University business professor and thrift
expert, said $2 billion is a small amount compared with the huge
volume of assets that need to be sold, but he praised the bulk
sales concept.
   ``I think the important thing is to get these things out of the
hands of the government, which is run for bureaucratic purposes,
and put them into the hands of private people who can make
decisions for entrepreneurial reasons. That will be best for the
taxpayers in the long run,'' Kane said.
   Bulk sales have been criticized by others, who label it a fire
sale that could depress asset values by flooding the market.
   However, Kane said, ``When you have the financial equivalent of
a fire, a fire sale is the first thing you do.''
   Selling properties one by one is ``terribly inefficient,'' he
said.
   In its first 11 months, the RTC has taken over about 460 failed
S&amp;Ls, selling or closing about 210 of them. But in S&amp;L sales so
far, the agency has been stuck with about half of the institutions'
assets, usually the delinquent loans and repossessed real estate.
   The oversight board is permitting the bailout agency to lend
portfolio buyers up to 85 percent of the purchase price for up to
five years.
   ``Ideally we'd like it to be shorter term ... but we wanted to
give (the agency) the flexibility,'' said Felisa Neuringer, an
oversight board spokeswoman.
   After the trust corporation completes $2 billion in sales, the
oversight board will evaluate the program's success and consider
extending it.
   On a related matter, the oversight board authorized the trust
corporation to give some properties away to local governments and
non-pofit agencies for use as day care centers, housing for the
homeless or other public purposes.
   Properties will be eligible for the program if the agency
determines that the cost of holding and selling them exceeds their
value.
   Another part of the S&amp;L bureaucracy, the Federal Housing Finance
Board, announced approval of a $669 million housing program for
low-income people.
   The program, required by last year's S&amp;L bailout bill, is
financed by the 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks, which in turn
are owned by the S&amp;L industry.
   The finance board, headed by Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, is
spending $47.2 million from the home loan banks in combination with
private and foundation funds and other government grants and loans.
   The money will pay for 193 projects providing 13,706 housing
units in 37 states. Much of it will be used to offer low-interest
mortgage loans to low-income homebuyers through thrifts and banks.
   Fred Webber, president of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, the industry's largest trade group, noted that the
program would not exist without the industry-owned home loan banks.
   It ``demonstrates that this nation needs a separate, healthy
savings institution business to meet the need for decent,
affordable housing,'' he said.

   Pennzoil Co. has announced that it will invest
the remaining $480 million from its $2.6 billion Texaco lawsuit in
additional Chevron shares.
   The investment would give Pennzoil just under 10 percent of
Chevron's stock, Pennzoil officials said Monday.
   In a letter written to Pennzoil shareholders and filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission Monday, Pennzoil also griped
openly for the first time about how Chevron management is running
the company.
   Chevron declined to comment on Pennzoil's latest statement of
intentions.
   The San Francisco oil giant has been fighting Houston-based
Pennzoil since last year, when Pennzoil used its Texaco spoils to
accumulate 8.8 percent of Chevron's stock. Chevron filed suit,
claiming Pennzoil lied when it said it was buying the stock for
investment purposes only.
   Pennzoil said Monday it does not currently plan to acquire 10
percent or more of Chevron, a larger stake would trigger Chevron's
``poison pill.''
   But Pennzoil also applied Monday to the Federal Trade Commission
for clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act to purchase
15 percent or more of the stock.
   ``We believe Chevron has the potential to be an attractive
long-term investment for Pennzoil and its shareholders,'' Harper
said of the additional shares Pennzoil plans to purchase.
   The balance of the $2.6 billion Texaco settlement is in
short-term securities, and the company wants a more lucrative home
for them that will provide the tax shelter Pennzoil is seeking,
Harper said.

<HEAD>Pathe Delivers Another $53 Million on Its Merger Deal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pathe Communications Corp. has paid
another $53 million toward purchase of MGM-UA Communications Co,
bringing its total nonrefundable down-payments to $253 million.
   ``It is a step in our plans to consummate the merger of the two
companies,'' Scott Tagliarino, a spokesman for MGM-UA, said Monday.
   ``It is a further demonstration of Pathe's seriousness about the
transaction and we're confident that the financing for the balance
will be arranged,'' said Pathe spokesman Craig Parsons.
   Under terms of the latest agreement between Pathe chief
Giancarlo Parretti and Kirk Kerkorian, who controls MGM-UA, the
$253 million will be paid out Friday to MGM-UA shareholders at $4
per share.
   Kerkorian is the chief shareholder, controlling more than 70
percent of the entertainment company's common shares.
   Parretti has made payments of $50 million per month since March,
while he tried to arrange financing for the $1.3 billion purchase.
   He has agreed to make another $50 million payment next month and
one in September, then come up with the balance in October.
   Parretti had agreed to a $20-a-share offer, but raised it to
$21.50 a share in return for a four-month extension on the deal
after failing to come to terms with his major backer, Time Warner
Inc.
   Time Warner had been the most solid-appearing component of
Pathe's offer with the rest of the money to be provided by loans
and assets from Pathe's affiliates.
   Time Warner had agreed to provide a $650 million loan to Pathe
for the deal in return for a lien on the valuable United Artists
film library and extensive distribution rights to Pathe and UA
movies.
   However, Time Warner has sued Pathe for $100 million, accusing
Pathe of breaching its contract by, among other things,
double-selling some distribution rights.
   The media conglomerate said Pathe apparently never was able to
meet one of the terms of the deal: that it come up with the other
half of the $1.3 billion in money that was not borrowed.
   Pathe counter-sued for $500 million last week, saying Time
Warner had breached its contractual duty to provide the $650
million loan.

<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. plans to follow General
Motors Corp. into Hungary by spending $80 million to build an auto
parts factory in the Eastern European nation.
   Ford, the second-largest U.S. automaker behind GM, said Monday
that it would begin making ignition coils and fuel pumps for
vehicles built in Western European countries in 1992. The factory
will make about 3.2 million parts a year and employ about 200
people when full production is reached.
   The plant is Ford's first venture into Hungary and Eastern
Europe. In January, GM announced a $150 million investment in the
state-owned Hungarian company RABA to manufacture automobiles and
engines.
   Ford said that in return for a five-year investment package
approved by the Hungarian government, the company will increase the
number of vehicles it brings into Hungary from Western Europe.
   Hungarian Industry and Commerce Minister Peter Akos Bod said
about 12,000 Fords were purchased in Hungary last year.
   Bruce Blythe, vice president for business strategy for Ford of
Europe Ltd., said the new plant's products will reduce pollution by
his company's cars.
   ``The components are critical to achieving the low-exhaust
emission levels that will become standard across Europe in the
mid-1990s,'' Blythe said.

<HEAD>Southland Announces Revised Restructuring Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Round-the-clock meetings during the weekend
produced an agreement between Southland Corp. and some of its
creditors that will pay cash to junk bond holders and give them a
larger share of a restructured company.
   But some analysts questioned if the sweetened deal, which also
calls for a larger cash infusion from Japanese investors, can save
the 7-Eleven convenience store chain owner burdened by huge debts
after a $4.9 billion leveraged buyout in 1987.
   ``No one's been able to prove to me yet why it wouldn't be
better to throw them into bankruptcy,'' said Jay Lustig, who
follows distressed companies for Drake Capital Securities Inc. in
Santa Monica, Calif.
   The agreement is the latest revision in a plan first announced
in March that involved a bailout by Ito-Yokado Co. Ltd. and
Seven-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd., a majority-owned subsidiary.
   Southland missed $69 million in interest payments due June 15,
and a 30-day grace period expired Sunday during which the
Dallas-based company could have made the payments without penalty.
   But weekend meetings between a committee of creditors, the
Japanese investors and Southland produced an agreement in principle
on the restructuring, spokeswoman Cecilia Stubbs Norwood said
Monday.
   The agreement replaces a proposal that would have paid holders
of $1.8 billion in debt about $550 million, plus stock and
securities in the new company. Ms. Norwood said no value was
immediately available on the revision.
   Also Monday, some bondholders filed a lawsuit in U.S. District
Court in Dallas asking that Southland be forced to pay $69 million
in interest payments it missed on June 15. The company reaffirmed
Monday that it would not make the payments, leaving open the door
for creditors to force Southland into bankruptcy court.
   Under the new proposal, Ito-Yokado and Seven-Eleven Japan would
contribute $430 million in new capital in exchange for 70 percent
of the common stock in the restructured company. Previously, the
two had agreed to inject $400 million and get 75 percent of the new
company.
   The founding Thompson family's share of the company would be
reduced form 6.5 percent to about 5 percent.
   Bondholders would get the additional shares, upping their
holdings to about 25 percent of the new company.
   Besides the increased stock, the most senior bondholders would
receive $57 in cash for each $1,000 of the bonds they currently
hold. No cash was included in the previous agreement.
   Other changes include increasing principal amounts of new
securities and common stock swapped for the old debt. In exchange,
the maturity dates are lengthened and interest rates lowered.
   Clark Matthews, Southland's chief financial officer, said
holders of more than 70 percent of the most senior notes indicate
they support the plan.
   The notes are considered a key group for this deal, which must
be approved by 95 percent of each class of bond, plus two-thirds of
preferred shareholders.
   ``We believe that we can successfully negotiate final documents
and complete a restructuring and are now aiming for mid-August,''
Matthews said.
   ``I would feel a lot better if they would go ahead and pay the
accrued interest,'' said David Glatstein of Barre &amp; Co. Inc., a
Dallas investment company that holds some of the bonds. Although he
said the revised plan ``is more palatable than anything they've
presented so far.''
   The revisions are ``better for the steering committee. It's not
much of a change for the four subordinated,'' classes of bonds,
Lustig said.
   Lustig said he doubted Southland could get 95 percent acceptance
_ a self-imposed level. ``My gut feeling is that if they get an 80
percent tender, they should just take it, kiss the ground and be
done with it,'' he said.
   Southland has been struggling under heavy interest payments
brought on by the buyout in 1987, which was announced before the
Oct. 19 market crash, but financed after it.
   In addition to the higher interest costs, cash has been drained
by increasing competition from proliferating convenience stores run
by major oil companies.
   Southland said last year it would be unable to meet obligations
in 1991. In March, the company first announced a proposed
restructuring with its Japanese partners.
   Southland operates about 6,900 7-Eleven stores and other
convenience outlets in the United States and Canada, with another
6,000 stores in the United States and 21 other countries run by
licensees, of which Seven-Eleven Japan is the largest.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge Approves Southmark Reorganization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge says Southmark Corp.'s
restructuring plan is fair and equitable, but offers no assurances
that federal regulators will not take further action against it.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stephen Felsenthal approved the plan
Monday, bringing one of the nation's largest bankruptcy cases near
an end.
   Under the plan, the company will liquidate almost all of its
holdings except for San Jacinto Savings Association, a $3 billion
thrift based in the Houston suburb of Bellaire.
   But Felsenthal said Southmark has no guarantees that federal
regulators will not seize the insolvent thrift. However, he said
the reorganization plan improves the prospects for creditors
recovering a fraction of what they are owed.
   ``It is in the public interest,'' said Felsenthal, who also
noted that he believes the plan does not rely on San Jacinto's
future.
   ``Reorganized Southmark should be able to perform under the plan
even if (San Jacinto) is seized after confirmation.''
   But a key element of the plan is an agreement by Southmark to
inject $100 million in new capital into San Jacinto, which
currently falls far short of regulatory capital requirements.
   Southmark filed for bankruptcy court protection from creditors
last July, listing assets of $1.05 billion and debts of more than
$1.4 billion.
   The plan calls for paying off holders of more than $1 billion in
junk bonds with $75 million in cash shortly after confirmation. In
addition, debt holders would receive preferred and common stock in
the new company, plus representation on a new board of directors.
   Southmark once held assets of more than $9 billion as it used
high yield, or junk bonds, to expand rapidly from a real estate
investment trust to a holding company owning campgrounds, nursing
homes, an insurance company and numerous other properties.
   Southmark filed for bankruptcy after a $1 billion first-quarter
loss last year put it in technical default on its junk bonds. The
company said it also would not be able to make principle and
interest payments because of the losses.

<HEAD>Suit Against S&amp;L Settled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government, which sought $400
million, has agreed to settle a lawsuit against former officers of
Eureka Federal Savings and Loan for $68 million, according to a
published report.
   The San Francisco Chronicle reported in today's editions that
the agreement was reached Sunday night, ending a trial in U.S.
District Court in San Francisco that started in May.
   Former Eureka President Kenneth Kidwell and four other officers
of the San Carlos-based thrift were sued by Eureka and the
government. They were accused of allegedly mismanaging the
institution's loan portfolios in 1983 and 1984 and incurring more
than $200 million in losses. Regulators brought in new management
in 1985 and three years later sold the institution to American
First Corp., in 1988.
   Federal regulators contended Kidwell, Robert N. Harris, Allan R.
Jamieson, Donald B. Keuper, and Walter Gilliam Jr., made more than
150 real estate and commercial loans totaling $260 million that
almost immediately went into default.
   Recipients of the loans included casinos in Reno and Las Vegas
and real estate projects in Texas, Wisconsin, Florida and other
states.
   The government charged that the loans were made without required
regulatory approval, without adequate assessment of the borrower's
financial state and with numerous other negligent actions.
   Arthur Shartsis, Kidwell's lawyer, said on Monday the settlement
was ``a very bad result for the government.'' He said it had
refused to accept a $78 million settlement offer from the
defendants' insurance company shortly before the trial started.
   John Thomas, associate general counsel for the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., said the defendants had refused to negotiate on
any kind of settlement until last fall when they came up with a $45
million offer that the government rejected.
   Thomas conceded that in light of the later $78 million offer,
``with the benefit of hindsight, we probably would do it a little
differently today.''

   A reorganization plan by Maxicare
Health Plans has been approved by a federal bankruptcy court,
allowing the health maintenance organization to emerge from court
supervision.
   The plan approved Monday will not be implemented until early
October, said Maxicare spokesman Ed Coughlan. The company still
must meet technical and cash requirements before emerging from
bankruptcy protection, he said.
   ``We have a significant amount of cash on hand, but we still
have to generate more. But we don't anticipate that will be a
problem,'' Coughlan said.
   The plan calls for creditors and shareholders to receive about
$130 million in cash, 10-year notes at 13.5 percent interest with a
face value of about $67 million, and common stock and options.
   More than 90 percent of the HMO's creditors and shareholders
approved the proposal, according to Maxicare, which had filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection March 16.
   Forty-nine percent of the restructured company will be owned by
medical facilities and doctors who continue providing services to
Maxicare members.
   The court also continued a preliminary injunction that prevents
creditor doctors and hospitals from billing Maxicare members for
debts owed by the firm.
   The Los Angeles-based health maintenance organization operates
in California, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, North Carolina, South
Carolina and Wisconsin.

<HEAD>Iraqi Leader Delivers Stern Warning on Oil Over-Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein on Tuesday warned
Gulf oil producers that Iraq will retaliate against them _ possibly
with force _ if they continue producing above OPEC quotas.
   He said the excessive production is an American plot carried out
by some rulers in the Gulf designed to deplete revenues from oil
exports, which has cost Iraq billions of dollars.
   The Iraqi leader, speaking on television on the 22nd anniversary
of his ruling Baath Party coming to power, said: ``Raising our
voice against the evil is not the final resort if the evil
continues.''
   ``There should be some effective act to bring back things to
their right place ... Iraqis will not forget the proper saying that
cutting necks is better than cutting the means of living,'' he
said. ``Oh God Almighty be witness that we have warned them.'',
   Saddam did not mention any country by name. But Iraqi Oil
Minister Abdulrahim al-Chalabi has named the United Arab Emirates
and Kuwait as the culprits for violating production ceilings set by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   ``The policies of some Arab rulers are American. They are
inspired by America to undermine Arab interests and security,''
Saddam said.
   He said that since the collapse of communist governments in
Eastern Europe, the United States is seeking to become the only
world superpower and ``implement this dream through controlling
Gulf oil.
   He said the overproduction brought prices down and allowed the
United States to to add to its strategic stockpiles of oil with
cheap oil.
   The Iraqi leader said certain Gulf leaders are trying to
undermine Iraq after it emerged ``triumphant'' in its eight-year
war with Iran.
   He vowed that he will not let them continue this policy which he
described as ``dangerous and harming the interests and the security
of the Arab nation.''
   The United Arab Emirates has been overproducing its OPEC-set
production quota by about one million barrels a day and Kuwait by
some 200,000 barrels per day.
   This has been one reason for a recent fall in oil prices from
OPEC's benchmark goal of $18 per barrel to as low as $14 dollars a
barrel.
   Saddam's statement comes after an agreement was reportedly
reached last week in Saudi Arabia which would increase the U.A.E.
quota from 1.1. million barrels a day to 1.5 million. Under the
agreement Kuwait would stick to its 1.5 million barrel-a-day
ceiling.
   Iraq was one of the major Arab OPEC producers which accepted the
new arrangement.
   Oil ministers of the cartel, scheduled to meet in Geneva,
Switzerland, on July 25, are expected to accept the settlement.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Climbed to $7.73 Billion in May</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: removes extraneous matter in middle. This also moved on

<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit climbed to $7.73
billion in May, reflecting a big jump in imports of oil and foreign
cars, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said the May trade deficit was 5.8
percent higher than a revised April imbalance of $7.31 billion.
   In May, imports climbed 2.9 percent to $40.52 billion,
offsetting a 2.3 percent rise in U.S. exports, which totaled $32.79
billion in May. The trade deficit is the difference between imports
and exports.
   The big surge in oil accounted for almost half of the increase
in imports in May, with imports of cars and other manufactured
goods accounting for the rest of the gain.
   This increase overshadowed a healthy advance in U.S. exports,
which posted their second best showing on record.
   The Bush administration is counting on strength in exports to
offset a sluggish domestic economy and keep the country out of a
recession this year.
   During the first three months of 1990, fully half of all
economic growth was contributed by gains in exports.
   Through the first five months of this year, the U.S. trade
deficit has been running at an annual rate of $97.68 billion,
surprising many analysts who had been forecasting that this year's
deficit would be little changed from the $109.4 billion imbalance
recorded in 1989.
   The Bush administration is confidently predicting that America's
trade performance will continue to improve throughout the year.
However, many private analysts worry that America's growing
dependence on foreign oil will cut into the export gains being made
by U.S. businesses.
   In May, oil imports shot up 15.2 percent to $4.32 billion. The
advance reflected an increase in the volume of shipments, which
rose to 8.95 million barrelsa day, up from daily shipments of 7.55
million barrels in April.
   The price per barrel actually fell to $15.57 per barrel, down a
full $1 from the April price.
   Shipments of new cars were up 5.2 percent in May to $3.88
billion, reflecting higher imports from Canada and other countries,
which offset a drop in car shipments from Japan.
   The rise in U.S. exports reflected higher shipments in a variety
of areas, including automotive parts, capital goods and consumer
products.
   The United States continued to enjoy a trade surplus with the
countries of Western Europe of $812 million in May while Japan
continued to be the country with which the United States had the
largest trade deficit.
   In May, the deficit with Japan totaled $2.97 billion, down
sharply from a $3.95 billion April imbalance.

<HEAD>CBOT Chief's Firm Ordered to Adjust Finances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major commodities trading company headed by the
chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade says it is parceling out
some accounts to get its books back in order.
   Stotler and Co., headed by Karsten Mahlmann, also said Monday
that it is seeking an outside investor.
   Stotler has been directed by the Board of Trade to bring its
amount of cash-on-hand up to 4 percent of customer funds, as
required by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, by the close
of business Wednesday, said a statement issued by the firm's parent
company, Stotler Group Inc.
   If a brokerage does not maintain the required amount of
regulatory capital, the exchange can restrict the brokerage to
trading only for the purpose of liquidation and can transfer that
brokerage's customer accounts to other brokerages, said Michael
O'Connell, a Board of Trade spokesman.
   He referred questions about the specifics of the case to
Chicago-based Stotler Group, where spokesman Vito Piazza declined
to comment beyond the prepared statement.
   The statement said Stotler planned to meet the requirement by
transferring a portion of its customer accounts and trading
positions to other brokerages and by seeking ``a capital infusion
from various parties.''
   The moves are likely to reduce the firm's revenue and net
income, Stotler said.
   ``Without a capital infusion, Stotler Group may be unable to
meet its debt obligations unless those obligations are refinanced
or restructured,'' the company said.
   The Chicago Tribune reported Saturday that Stotler, one of the
nation's 10 biggest futures brokerages, may have run afoul of
capital requirements because of its recent rapid growth.
   Stotler Group said another subsidiary brokerage, R.G. Dickinson
&amp; Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, was not affected by the compliance
problems at Stotler and Co.

   But among all New York Stock Exchange issues in nationwide
trading, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about a 5

   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.72 million shares after the
first half hour of the session.
   Analysts say the stock market may not sustain its rally of the
past four days. The Dow crossed the 3,000 mark for the second
straight session Monday, but was not able to maintain that level by
the close. Trading volume also slowed from last week's strong pace.
   The Dow never has closed at 3,000 or above.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's
trade deficit climbed to $7.73 billion in May, 5.8 percent higher
than a revised April imbalance of $7.31 billion. But the report was
not expected to have much impact on Wall Street because it was
within analysts' expectations.

   Wheat and soybean futures prices were slightly
higher while the corn and oat markets slipped a bit this morning on
the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting a combination of bullish and
bearish signals.
   A National Weather Service forecast for cool, rainy weather
early next week in the Midwest was a depressing factor in the corn
and soybean pits, analysts said.
   But selling linked to the six-to-10-day outlook was offset by
contradictory forecasts from some private forecasters and by
perceptions that the corn and bean markets were due for a
correction after sharp recent losses, said Ann Fricke, senior
oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Wheat futures also were viewed as oversold after three straight
weeks of losses linked to the nearly completed winter wheat harvest.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 2 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in July at $3.04{ a bushel; corn
futures were unchanged to } cent lower with July at $2.73\ a
bushel; oats were unchanged to 1{ cents lower with July at $1.20 a

   Cattle futures were mixed in early trading on the Chicago

reflecting continued strength in the cash hog market.
   Live cattle futures were .03 cent to .13 cent higher with August

   President Bush said today that disturbing new
figures on the federal deficit show that the ``time for game
playing is over'' and he pledged to increase pressure for a
compromise on new taxes and budget cuts.
   ``We're getting to a crunch,'' Bush told a group of magazine
publishers at the White House. ``It is absolutely essential that
something be done. I will do my part.''
   He commented a day after the White House Office of Budget and
Management boosted its estimate of the fiscal 1991 deficit to
$168.8 billion _ up $10 billion from the administration's estimates
a month ago and up sharply from the $100.5 billion it estimated in
January.
   The projected deficit is more than $100 billion above the
Gramm-Rudman law target of $64 billion.
   Congressional budget negotiators had given mixed reviews to the
administration's gloomy assessment _ some saying it would help prod
slow-moving talks and others suggesting the opposite.
   ``Given yesterday's news,'' Bush said today, ``...the time for
game-playing is over. And we have to get something done that is not
only a sound budget agreement but is seen by the American people to
be a sound budget agreement.''
   Bush said that while he was still ``fairly optimistic'' such a
pact could be reached, it will require both spending cuts and tax
increases.
   Bush earlier this month abandoned his 1988 ``no new taxes''
campaign pledge.
   The president said he was fearful ``about the confidence in the
marketplace'' should a budget deal not be struck.
   ``We will be pushing in the next couple of weeks and the meter
is running,'' Bush said.
   Budget summit talks between administration officials and
congressional leaders enter their third month this week. Meanwhile,
the House planned to vote today on a conservative-backed
constitutional amendment that would require a balanced budget.
   Backers of the amendment conceded Monday they seemed to be
several votes short of the two-thirds margin needed to approve a
constitutional amendment.
   Bush sent a letter to Capitol Hill urging support of the
amendment and calling for a line-item veto and greater authority
for the president to impound funds appropriated by Congress.
   ``Together with political courage and discipline, these tools
are vital to solving the problem of budget deficits,'' Bush said,
calling the balanced budget amendment ``crucial to our nation's
long-term economic health and prosperity.''
   The administration coupled the release of the revised figures
Monday with a bleak assessment of how a $100 billion cut in
services _ which would be triggered this fall by the Gramm-Rudman
law in the absence of a budget accord _ would affect government
services.
   The scenarios included eliminating half the nation's 2 million
active military personnel, reducing hours of operation at the
nation's airports and halting increased drug interdiction efforts
at the country's borders.
   No one was willing to say they believed such dramatic cuts would
be allowed to stand for very long. As recently as last fall, the
Gramm-Rudman law required spending cuts that were rolled back as
soon as negotiators worked out a budget deal.
   But some lawmakers argued Monday that the new numbers
illustrated a problem that had to be dealt with.
   ``The day of reckoning has arrived,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta,
D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget Committee. He said
congressional leaders had asked the White House to illustrate
possible budget cuts ``to find a way to convey a sense of crisis
... to show both our colleagues and the country that there is no
choice here.''
   Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, ranking Republican on the
Senate Budget Committee, said the details should send a message to
lawmakers who have opposed the budget talks.
   ``They now have a clear alternative,'' Domenici said. ``If it is
not an economic summit, it is this, it is a $100 billion''
automatic spending cut.
   Not everyone agreed. One of the more partisan Democratic budget
negotiators, Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, noted
that the new deficit projection was just $9 billion higher than the
shortfall the administration informally projected a month ago.
   Sasser, D-Tenn., described the talks as ``stalled.'' In
contrast, Panetta said White House and congressional staff
discussed possible tax-raising proposals over the weekend.
   The $168.8 billion shortfall projection did not include the
costs of bailing out the savings and loan industry. When that
spending is included, the White House estimated a $231.4 billion
budget gap.
   The balanced budget amendment, if approved by two-thirds votes
of each house of Congress and three-fourths of the states, would
ban the government from spending more than it takes in unless
three-fifths of the Congress voted to waive the requirement.
   The balanced budget rules would not take effect before fiscal
1993, and would be set aside in time of war.
   The House last voted on a balanced budget amendment in 1982,
falling more than 40 votes short of approval. The House Democratic
leadership opposes the amendment.

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said Tuesday its earnings
rose 26 percent to a record $274 million for the second quarter,
led by sales of the antidepressant drug Prozac and other
pharmaceuticals.
   For the three months ending June 30, earnings per share were 93
cents, compared with 75 cents on net income of $217 million during
the same period in 1989. Sales rose 24 percent to a record $1.23
billion from $986.6 million during the second quarter last year.
   Chairman Richard D. Wood said Lilly experienced sales growth in
each of its operations.
   ``Sales increased in both international and domestic markets.
Higher unit volume continued to be the main contributor to the
quarter's results,'' Wood said. Operating costs grew slower than
sales, he added.
   Worldwide sales of pharmaceutical products ``were significantly
higher than those of the second quarter of last year,'' Lilly said
in a prepared statement. Besides Prozac, other pharmaceutical sales
leaders included the drugs Axid, Ceclor, Dobutrex, Humatrope and
Humulin, Lilly said.
   Lilly also reported record results for the first six months of
1990. Net income increased 23 percent to $615 million, or $2.07 per
share, on sales of $2.47 billion.

<HEAD>Industrial Production Climbs 0.4 Percent in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spurt in automobile production and a heat
wave that boosted utility output pushed industrial production up
0.4 percent in June, the Federal Reserve reported Tuesday.
   Last month's 0.4 percent gain, which followed a rise of 0.6
percent in May, surprised analysts who had been expecting a more
modest increase.
   The June increase helped push industrial production for the
second quarter up by an annual rate of 3.5 percent, a significant
improvement over the mediocre 0.6 percent annual rate of gain in
the first three months of the year.
   However, private analysts cautioned that the upturn was likely
due to temporary factors rather than any long-term comeback in the
nation's manufacturing sector, which has been in a slump for months.
   Analysts attributed much of the recent strength in auto
production to the likelihood that automakers have been building up
inventories in preparation for a possible September walkout by the
United Auto Workers.
   ``Although the number is good, it's not necessarily a harbinger
of strength in the months ahead. The manufacturing sector is still
in the doldrums,'' said Michael K. Evans, who heads a Washington
economic forecasting company.
   Still, Cynthia Latta of DRI-McGraw Hill said the increase in
industrial production showed ``we're still slogging along with very
slow growth, but some growth.''
   ``Manufacturing is not booming, it's struggling,'' she said.
``But since output does seem to be expanding slightly, it has to be
viewed as a relatively good report.''
   The Fed said that the increases in automobile production and
utility output accounted for three-fourths of the total June
increase.
   The Fed also reported the operating rate of the nation's
factories, mines and utilities, which usually move in tandem with
industrial production, rose 0.2 percentage point to 83.5 percent of
capacity in June.
   The operating rate measures not only output but changes in
productivity levels.
   While the June operating rate was the highest since December's
83.7 percent, it was still well below the level a year ago when the
industrial sector was operating at 84.6 percent of capacity.
   Industrial production at manufacturing plants making both
durable and non-durable goods rose 0.5 percent in June after
increasing 0.8 percent in May.
   Output of durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last at
least three years _ also increased 0.5 percent after a jump of 1.3
percent a month earlier. Manufacturing of non-durable goods such as
food and clothing was up 0.4 percent after a 0.1 percent increase
in May.
   The Fed said its industrial production index in June stood at
109.8 percent of its 1987 base, up from 109.3 in May.

   Stock prices finished higher on London's Stock
Exchange Tuesday but below the day's best levels.
   Prices shot up in the early going, boosted by Wall Street's
performance Monday. But the gains were short-lived, as a mediocre
opening on Wall Street Tuesday and concerns about the British
economy gave way to selected profit-taking in some of the blue chip
stocks.
   But dealers said there was no heavy selling pressure.
   ``There's no real disinvestment going on,'' one dealing director
said. ``People are hesitant to part with any large lines of stock
because they feel they'll have to buy it back later at a higher
price.''
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 8.5 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,415.0.
   Its peak was 2,430.6 and its low was 2,407.6.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 12 points at 1,912.9
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 2.87 points
to close at 1,298.45.
   Volume came to 493.6 million shares, compared with 346.9 million

   The U.S. dollar fell against the major currencies
in European trading on Tuesday in mostly technical trading.
   Gold prices also fell.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the announcement that the U.S.
trade deficit in May grew to $7.73 billion from a revised $7.31
billion in April helped push the dollar down in slack trading. They
said the dollar did not decline further because the deficit's
growth was in line with expectations.
   The later news that U.S. industrial output increased by 0.4
percent in June helped bring the dollar back somewhat, the dealers
said.
   The markets were waiting for Wednesday's scheduled congressional
testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who was
expected to outline U.S. monetary policy.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8115 late Tuesday, more
expensive for buyers than Monday's late $1.8040. At midday in New
York, sterling traded at $1.81415.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
levels, included: 1.6455 German marks, down from 1.6535; 1.4065
Swiss francs, down from 1.4165; 5.5210 French francs, down from
5.5460; 1.8552 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8640; 1,205.12 Italian
lire, down from 1,210.75; and 1.1562 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1587.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 148.20 Japanese yen, down
from 148.43 late Monday. In London late Tuesday, the dollar traded
higher at 148.32 yen, and in New York at midday, it was quoted at
147.975 yen.
   Other midday prices for the dollar in New York included: 1.6450
West German marks, 1.40375 Swiss francs, 1,204.50 Italian lire and
1.15575 Canadian dollars.
   The late bid price of gold in London was $361.25 a troy ounce,
down from $362.75 on Monday. The late bid price in Zurich was
$361.50, down from $362.70.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed fell 75 cents to close at a

   Stock prices fell marginally today following a
spate of disappointing earnings reports that spoiled an earlier
rise in the Dow Jones industrial average.
   The Dow average of 30 industrial stocks stood at 2,993.07 as of
2 p.m. on Wall Street, down 6.68 from Monday's close. Earlier, the
Dow hovered above the 3,000 mark.
   Among all New York Stock Exchange issues in nationwide trading,
declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 5 to 3, with
517 up, 896 down and 562 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 125.17 million shares.
   Analysts say the stock market may not sustain its rally of
recent days. The Dow crossed the 3,000 mark for the second straight
session Monday, but was unable to maintain that level by the close,
though it ended the session at its third consecutive record high.
Trading volume also slowed from last week's strong pace.
   The Dow never has closed at 3,000 or above.
   The market had little reaction to two government economic
reports this morning. The nation's trade deficit climbed to $7.73
billion in May from a revised April imbalance of $7.31 billion.
Meanwhile, industrial production rose 0.4 percent in June and plant
capacity utilitzation increased 0.2 percentage point to 83.5
percent.
   United Telecommunications, parent of US Sprint, was the
most-active NYSE issue, with more than 8 million shares changing
hands. It lost 7{ to move to 30} after reporting its second-quarter
profit dropped 55.1 percent.
   GTE Corp., the third most-active NYSE issue, fell } to 28\. The
company's report that its second-quarter profit rose 11 percent was
short of analysts' expectations. At the same time, United Telecom
said it was postponing its purchase of the 19.9 percent of Sprint
owned by GTE.
   Coca-Cola, one of the most-active blue chip stocks, rose 1 to

   Martin L. Grass, president of Rite Aid
Corp., said Tuesday he will take legal action against Ohio
officials who waged what he called an ``outrageous'' prosecution
against him.
   Grass called reporters to company headquarters here and said he
will expand his federal defamation lawsuit to include more people
at the Ohio Board of Pharmacy.
   Grass and Rite Aid were cleared Monday of a bribery charge when
a Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court judge dismissed the case after
the prosecution rested its case.
   Grass said it was clear from the testimony that the prosecution
had no case against him. He charged that no police agency ever
investigated the case, investigators were never called to testify,
and prosecutor William Caine was more interested in furthering his
career.
   ``When somebody comes at you like that, you don't sit back and
take it,'' Grass said. ``You have to retaliate.''
   Caine declined to comment Tuesday.
   Grass and the company were accused of trying to bribe Ohio
pharmacy board member Melvin Wilczynski to step down so a new board
member favorable to Rite Aid could be appointed. Grass said
Wilczynski was a consultant to a drug store chain that Rite Aid had
just acquired and the board member was given a Rite Aid check for
$33,000 to buy out his contract.
   Grass' defamation suit was filed last year in federal court in
Cleveland against Wilczynski and had been on hold pending outcome
of the criminal trial.
   Accusing Ohio of a double enforcement standard, Grass said other
chains, including one Rite Aid acquired, were never cited by the
pharmacy board. But he said it appeared to be targeted for alleged
violations soon after Rite Aid bought nearly 300 additional stores
and became one of the state's largest chains.
   ``We just didn't like having a dual standard,'' Grass said. ``As
far as we're concerned, Ohio is the only state we've been in where
there's been selective enforcement. It seemed like there were rules
for one group and rules for another group and we were in the wrong
group.''
   Jack Smittle, assistant executive director for the Ohio Board of
Pharmacy, also declined comment Tuesday.
   Grass said the 15-month ordeal had put a damper on the company
stock, with some pensions and other buyers avoiding it because of a
cloud of suspicion hanging over Rite Aid.
   He said the trial had no effect on retail sales and the company
will not change operations in Ohio.

<HEAD>Draft Treaty on Services Issued, Disagreement on Coverage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARE NULLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior world trade negotiator on Tuesday
circulated a draft treaty setting out new rules to liberalize
global trade in services, worth more than $600 billion a year.
   The draft provides for the establishment of a General Agreement
on Trade in Services, similar to the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, GATT, which has governed trade in goods for more than 40
years.
   But the text by services negotiating group chairman Felipe
Jaramillo fails to define what services will be covered, reflecting
the deadlock between the United States and other countries involved
in the talks.
   Negotiators are meant to agree on an outline text by the end of
this month to enable a services accord to be made final when the
four-year round of Uruguay trade talks concludes in December. The
ambitious negotiations are also due to draw up new rules in 14
other areas of world trade, such as agriculture and textiles.
   Industrialized countries have led the way in pressing for a new
agreement to open markets to services such as tourism,
transportation and telecommunications. The rapidly growing sector
now accounts for an average 60 percent of employment and Gross
Domestic Product in the developed world, according to estimates
from the Geneva-based GATT secretariat.
   Third World countries were initially worried that, denied
protection, their infant service industries would be overwhelmed by
competition from indutrialized countries.
   However, the text presented by Jaramillo, a Colombian national,
seeks to ease these concerns by stating that the ``process of
liberalization shall take place with due respect to ... the level
of development in individual parties.''
   The 25 articles of the draft treaty set out the general
obligations of signatories, as well as provisions for progressive
liberalization, specific commitments on market access, and
institutional questions like dispute settlement.
   The text seeks to reconcile conflicting interests. However, the
section titled coverage was left blank.
   Trade sources say that most countries, including the 12 members
of the European Community, have argued that the treaty should cover
all services.
   Under this universal approach special needs of individual
sectors could be tackled through more detailed amendments once
agreement on a broad framework has been reached.
   The United States, by contrast, wants coverage of the general
treaty to be narrower. In particular, U.S. negotiators have pressed
for a format that would allow financial services, aviation and
shipping to be excluded.
   Washington, while pressing for greater overall liberalization,
is reportedly anxious to protect existing bilateral deals that
benefit the U.S. aviation and maritime industry.
   On financial services, the U.S. Treasury wants to retain control
over prudential regulation _ rules meant to ensure the soundness of
the banking system. Trade sources say Japan backs the United States
on this.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British jeweler Asprey PLC said Tuesday it will
buy rivals Mappin and Webb Ltd. and Garrard and Co. from Sears PLC
for 75 million pounds, or $136 million, in stock.
   Asprey said the purchase would reinforce its position ``at the
forefront of the luxury goods trade'' by expanding its customer
base in both the domestic and export markets.
   Garrard is Britain's ``Crown Jeweler,'' appointed to care for
the crown jewels worn by Queen Elizabeth II on ceremonial occasions
and displayed in the Tower of London.
   The three prestigious retailers also hold various royal warrants
as silversmiths, goldsmiths and jewelers to the queen, the Queen
Mother and Prince Charles.
   The jewelers also sell objets d'art, clocks, porcelain, crystal,
antiques and leather goods.
   They have showrooms in London's posh Bond and Regent streets and
in the Harrods department store, among others.
   Asprey, which is closely held and will continue to be 50.7
percent owned by the Asprey family, said it would issue 18.5
million new, special shares to Sears.
   These new shares, plus Sears' existing 25.5 percent common stock
stake in Asprey, will give Sears the right to 38.5 percent of
Asprey's profits.
   Sears PLC is unrelated to the similarly named American retailer.
   Asprey's shares fell 15 pence, or 27 cents, to finish at 390
pence, or $7.06, Tuesday on London's Stock Exchange.
   Asprey will continue to operate Mappin and Webb and Garrard
under their own names and plans to maintain the current stores.
   Asprey Chairman John Asprey called the acquisition ``a landmark
in the history of Asprey.'' He said the new group would employ 900
people.
   Asprey, with stores in London, New York and Geneva, had
after-tax profits of 14.9 million pounds, or $27 million, on sales
of 75.3 million pounds, or $136 million, in the year ended March 31.

<HEAD>Automakers Expect Lower Second-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Big Three automakers are expected to make
about half as much money in the second quarter this year as they
did last year, analysts said Tuesday.
   Economic problems in Brazil caused problems for General Motors
Corp. and Ford Motor Co. while incentives and increased Jeep
competition reduced profits at Chrysler Corp., they said.
   GM and Ford report their earnings July 25; Chrysler releases its
figures July 31.
   Average earnings estimates from seven analysts contacted Tuesday
by The Associated Press suggested that GM's earnings were expected
to drop about 40 percent from a year ago, Ford's would be off about
49 percent and Chrysler's were forecast to be down about 46 percent.
   In last year's second quarter, GM earned $1.5 billion, Ford made
$1.4 billion and Chrysler earned $341 million.
   GM reported three months ago that its 1990 first-quarter
earnings fell to $710 million, down 54 percent from last year's
first quarter, Ford's were down 69 percent to $506 million and
Chrysler's were off 80 percent to $71 million.
   ``Except for Brazil, it's pretty much shipping fewer cars for
lower prices,'' said analyst David Healy of the Barclays de Zoete
Wedd investment banking firm in New York.
   GM and Ford have large operations in Brazil that supply many of
the vehicles they sell in South America. The Brazilian government
put the brakes on the nation's economy earlier this year when the
inflation rate topped 1,000 percent annually.
   The two largest U.S. automakers' operations in Brazil were shut
down and only recently have they seen the beginning of a recovery.
   ``For the first four to five weeks in the quarter, there was
virtually no production in Brazil,'' said analyst John Kirnan of
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. of New York. ``Brazil is definitely a drag on
the earnings.''
   The top two automakers recently have relied on their overseas
operations for much of their profits. GM and Ford have reported
record overseas earnings recently while North American operations
ran on marginal profits.
   Chrysler, in the worst overall financial shape of the Big Three,
has essentially no overseas profit base.
   In North America, each of the Big Three watched incentive costs
and a listless sales pace squeeze their profits. Late in the
quarter, the sales pace began to pick up as the companies boosted
production and pared incentive offers, estimated to cost about
$1,000 per vehicle.
   ``From a domestic standpoint, it looks like the worst is over,''
said analyst Douglas Laughlin of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. of New York.
``Chrysler is purely a victim of circumstances in the North
American market.''
   For Chrysler, the third quarter promises to be a tough one. The
nation's third largest automaker plans to stop production at its
minivan plants in St. Louis and Windsor, Ontario, during the period
to retool for the redesigned 1991 models. That's likely to cause an
availability problem for one of Chrysler's most profitable vehicles.
   ``They fully expect to get hammered by the minivan changeover,''
said analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan, Stanley &amp; Co. of New York.
   Chrysler's other moneymaker, the Jeep Cherokee, is seeing its
dominance of the sport-utility market slip with the recent
introduction of the four-door Chevrolet Blazer and Ford Explorer.
   Analysts expected that the erosion of Cherokee's 25 percent
share of the market segment will accelerate as production of the
Blazer and Explorer increase.

<HEAD>French Steel Company Plans to Buy U.S. Steel Trading Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France's biggest steel company, state-owned Usinor
Sacilor SA, said Tuesday it plans to acquire Edgcomb Corp., a
privately held U.S. steel trading firm.
   The French company said the purchase depends on Edgcomb's
current owners buying up all of the outstanding debt. No price was
given for the acquisition, which must be approved by U.S.
authorities.
   The purchase of Edgcomb will strengthen Usinor Sacilor's market
position in the United States, especially in the East and Southeast.
   Last year, Usinor Sacilor became the world's second-biggest
steel producer through the acquisition of the ailing West German
steel company Saarstahl. Since then, the French company has sought
to build up its U.S. presence through acquisitions and partnerships.
   The French group already has two steel service centers in
Chicago, and is one of the biggest U.S. producers of stainless
steel following its acquisitions of Techalloy Inc., Alloy &amp;
Stainless Inc. and J &amp; L, a unit of LTV Corp., earlier this year.
   An official of Usinor Sacilor indicated that Edgcomb has about
$100 million of bonds outstanding.
   Edgcomb has 1,600 employees and recorded 1989 sales of about
$600 million, of which 45 percent involved flat products. It also
deals in stainless steel, long products and aluminum, and has 18
operational units on the Eastern seaboard.
   Usinor Sacilor's announcement came the same day as the release
of a report in Brussels, Belgium, detailing an aggressive expansion
campaign by French state-owned industries.
   European Deal Review, published by the U.S. consultancy group
Translink, said that in 1989 there were 40 French state
acquisitions of European targets, valued at $2.67 billion European
currency units, the equivalent of about $3.34 billion, which
amounted to 28 percent of the total value of all French
acquisitions in Europe.
   ``France is in effect nationalizing Europe,'' commented Mark
Dixon, the editor of the review.
   The review said that many governments consider the takeovers
unfair, because of the protection given to the French companies by
their own government.

<HEAD>Pfizer Posts 11 Percent Profit Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pfizer Inc. Tuesday said it earned 11 percent
more in the second quarter than it did a year earlier as stronger
sales in its health care and specialty chemicals divisions helped
produce a 15 percent revenue gain.
   The profit growth came despite disappointing sales from Pfizer's
animal health and consumer products segments.
   A 20 percent drop in specialty minerals sales, reflecting the
sale of a pigments business, also restrained the companywide sales
gain.
   Pfizer earned $151.2 million, or 90 cents a share, in the three
months ended July 1, up from $135.7 million, or 80 cents a share,
in 1989's second quarter. Sales rose to $1.49 billion from $1.30
billion.
   Edmund T. Pratt Jr., the New York-based pharmaceutical company's
chairman and chief executive officer, said the 26 percent growth in
health care was fueled by the increasing number of new Pfizer
products entering markets worldwide.
   Among some of the recently launched products are new
cardiovascular drugs, such as Procardia XL, Cardura and Norvasc,
and the antifungal agent Diflucan.
   ``Our net income is beginning to benefit from the earnings
momentum these products promise for the 1990s,'' Pratt said.
   By midyear, Pfizer earned $403.1 million, or $2.40 a share, up 7
percent from $376.5 million, or $2.23 a share, through the first
half of 1989. Half-year revenue rose 9 percent to $2.98 billion
from $2.74 billion.

   Stock prices fell marginally today following a
spate of disappointing earnings reports that helped spoil an
earlier rise in the Dow Jones industrial average.
   The Dow average of 30 industrial stocks stood at 2,993.56 as of
3 p.m. on Wall Street, down 6.19 from Monday's close. Earlier, the
Dow hovered above the 3,000 mark.
   Among all New York Stock Exchange issues in nationwide trading,
declining issues outnumbered advancing ones, with 536 up, 963 down
and 513 unchanged.
   The Dow crossed the 3,000 mark for the second straight session
Monday, but was unable to maintain that level by the close, though
it ended the session at its third consecutive record high. Trading
volume also slowed from last week's strong pace.
   The Dow never has closed at 3,000 or above.
   ``After reaching that new high yesterday, it's normal to have a
little profit taking,'' said Hank Striefler, a senior vice
president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   In addition, he said, the market was concerned about earnings
reports as well as the stalled budget talks in Congress.
   The market had little reaction to two government economic
reports this morning. The nation's trade deficit climbed to $7.73
billion in May from a revised April imbalance of $7.31 billion.
Meanwhile, industrial production rose 0.4 percent in June and plant
capacity utilitzation increased 0.2 percentage point to 83.5
percent.
   United Telecommunications, parent of US Sprint, was the
most-active NYSE issue, with more than 10 million shares changing
hands. It fell 8} to 29{ after reporting its second-quarter profit
dropped 55.1 percent.
   GTE Corp., the third most-active NYSE issue, fell 1 to 28. The
company's report that its second-quarter profit rose 11 percent was
short of analysts' expectations. At the same time, United Telecom
said it was postponing its purchase of the 19.9 percent of Sprint
owned by GTE.
   Lower earnings were reported by a number of other companies,
including Citicorp, Chemical Banking, Reynolds Metals, FMC and TRW.
   Coca-Cola, one of the most-active blue chip stocks, rose 1 to
46&rsqb; after reporting its second-quarter earnings jumped 18.6 percent
from a year earlier.
   Among other active blue chips, AT&amp;T fell &rsqb; to 36}, IBM fell 2&rsqb;
to 120 and Philip Morris dropped \ to 50.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 142.77 million shares as of 3
p.m. EDT.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped 1.54 to 199.59. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index fell 1.72 to 363.86.

   The Dow Jones industrial average flirted with the 3,000 mark for

<HEAD>NYNEX CEO Says Florida Bashes Were Not Company Funded</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: `Materiel' in 2nd graf is correct.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   NYNEX Corp. neither funded nor supported a
subsidiary's annual Florida parties that featured call girls and
clients, the chairman of the telephone company said Tuesday.
   The annual Miami parties, which occurred between 1984 and 1988,
were attended by employees of Materiel Enterprises Co. _ which at
the time was NYNEX's unregulated purchasing arm _ and about 30
suppliers.
   The parties reportedly featured awards for the most perverted
partygoer and to the man who procured the most women.
   At a news conference, NYNEX Chairman William Ferguson called the
activities ``sophomoric'' and ``repugnant.'' He said, ``None of the
activities that were investigated were sponsored by the company.
None were paid for by the company. None took place on company
time.''
   An internal 1988 NYNEX investigation of the events resulted in
two employees being fired and six others being disciplined for
violating NYNEX's code of business conduct.
   A fired NYNEX consultant, who had no dealings with the parties,
told the Wall Street Journal that suppliers who attended and paid
for the parties saw their business increase by 67 percent while
those who didn't saw an increase of only about 3.5 percent.
   Ferguson said those figures were misleading and said there was
no evidence that any supplier ever benefited due to the parties.
   He also said the NYNEX investigation showed that employees who
attended the parties paid their own way. He said some offered
canceled checks as proof, while others said they paid cash.
   Materiel Enterprises' activities have become a key issue in the
company's pending request to New York regulators for a record
$919.7 million rate increase.
   The Federal Communications Commission in February ordered fines
totaling $1.4 million against the company's New York Telephone Co.
and New England Telephone and Telegraph Co. subsidiaries because of
$118.5 million in alleged overcharges made to the two units by
Materiel Enterprises.
   Materiel Enterprises, which was formed in 1983 to provide
equipment and services to the telephone companies, allegedly
engaged in a series of transactions with the two aimed at
increasing NYNEX's overall profit at customer expense.
   The FCC also ordered the two telephone subsidiaries to refund
about $35 million to customers. NYNEX has appealed the fine and
refund order.
   Ferguson said all documents concerning the Florida parties were
turned over to the state Public Service Commission and FCC in 1988.
   Asked why NYNEX didn't make the investigation public at that
time, Ferguson said: ``What would you have us do take out a full
newspaper ad? There's not a company in the world who would do that.
...We did what we had to do, we investigated and we took action.''
   Ferguson, who took over as NYNEX's chairman and chief executive
officer last October, said he was talking about the incidents now
``because it's become part of the rate case and because it's in the
public and I want some facts out there.''
   He said the parties first came to the attention of MECO
executives in 1985. An internal investigation was conducted by an
outside agency.
   ``They found no evidence of misconduct with respect to the
purchasing arrangement or contract with vendors,'' Ferguson said.
``As a result no action was taken.''
   He said the 1985 investigation made no mention of suppliers and
NYNEX employees sharing rooms, or of prostitutes attending
gatherings.
   But he said apparently ``these things (the parties) were
becoming bigger and bigger year after year.'' Another investigation
was launched in 1988.
   NYNEX transferred ownership of MECO to New York Telephone and
New England Telephone in March. The subsidiary now is regulated by
the state.

<HEAD>World Bank Reports Lower Fiscal Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank said Tuesday that efforts to
lower costs for Third World borrowers and increased provisions for
problem loans resulted in a 5 percent drop in its fiscal 1990 net
income over a year ago.
   The bank, which is owned by roughly 150 countries and is the
largest lender to the developing world, said its profit totaled
$1.04 billion for the year ended June 30, compared with earnings of
$1.09 billion in 1989.
   The 1990 figures include a $357 million provision set aside to
cover future loan losses and a $106 million charge for health and
insurance benefits to retired staff.
   Income was further reduced by about $150 million as a result of
the World Bank's decision to lower the loan commitment fees to
borrowers for a second consecutive year, the bank said.
   In discussing the profit decline, Ernest Stern, senior vice
president for finance, told a news conference, ``The World Bank
does not seek to maximize income. Our first priority ... is to
begin to reduce costs to our borrowers.
   ``Lower net income figures ... would not reflect a lower
income-generating capacity, but a discretionary decision not to
retain income which is not needed to maintain our very strong
financial position, particularly at a time when many of our
borrowers face serious cash flow problems.''
   The bank said it met its target 11 percent reserves-to-loan
ratio during the 1990 fiscal year. The reserves act as a buffer
against unforseeable events, such as volatility in foreign exchange
or higher interest rates, which could cause borrowing costs to rise
or borrowers to cease making payments.
   At the end of the last fiscal year, nine countries _ including
Panama, Nicaragua and Zambia _ were classified as being on a
``non-accrural basis,'' which means they have either stopped or
decreased their loan payments.
   The World Bank granted a total of $20.7 billion of new loans in
the year, down from $21.3 billion the year before.
   Of the latest total, $15.2 billion was lent by its International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Through its International
Development Association, which is funded by more than 30 of the
richer member countries, including the United States, the bank lent
$5.5 billion to the poorest countries.
   Disbursements on loans reached a record $13.9 billion in the
1990 fiscal year, up from the previous year's $11.3 billion, the
bank said.
   One reason for the increase was a $2 billion disbursement to
Mexico under Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's debt reduction
plan.
   Stern said the World Bank intends to support struggling Eastern
European countries by lending about $7 billion to that region over
the next three years.

<HEAD>Profit Declines at Citibank, Chemical, Manufacturers Hanover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company, said Tuesday
that its second quarter profit dropped 37 percent due to weakness
in the real estate market and the failure of Argentina and Brazil
to pay interest on their loans.
   Three other major banking companies reported profit declines for
the quarter: Chemical Banking Corp. fell 12.6 percent,
Manufacturers Hanover Corp. tumbled 68.9 percent and Bank of New
York Co. Inc. fell 39 percent.
   Wells Fargo &amp; Co. reported that a one-time gain on a joint
venture helped lift its second-quarter profit by 58 percent from a
year ago.
   The reports came on the heels of second quarter profit declines
at two other leading banking companies. Chase Manhattan Corp. said
Monday its profit plunged 62 percent, while earnings fell 35
percent at First Chicago Corp.
   ``The operating environment for the banking industry has been
poor,'' said James J. McDermott Jr., research director at Keefe,
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc. ``Most banks are bedeviled by deteriorating
real estate asset quality and a slow operating economy.''
   He said many major banks had ``served notice not to expect much,
and we are not getting much.''

<HEAD>Citicorp</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The parent of the nation's biggest bank, Citibank, said it
earned $248 million, or 64 cents a share, for the three months
ended June 30 compared with $395 million, or $1.11 a share, a year
earlier.
   The company said its earnings rose 28 percent in consumer
banking activities and 44 percent in international banking and
finance activities.
   But it said results from its global finance operations in Japan,
Europe and North America dropped 69 percent, mainly due to weakness
in the real estate market, especially in the United States.
   Citicorp said its net commercial loan writeoffs amounted to $92
million, including $42 million stemming from U.S. real estate,
compared with net writeoffs of $29 million a year earlier.
   ``The continuing uncertain real estate environment may cause
write-offs to continue at a relatively high levels until we see
some stabilization in values,'' the company stated.
   Citicorp also reported an $82 million loss for the quarter on
cross-border loans, mainly due to non-payment of loan interest by
Argentina and Brazil. Citicorp reported a profit of $25 million
from such activity in the quarter last year, including $88 million
in loan payments from Brazil.
   In the latest quarter, Citicorp wrote off $631 million in loans
to Brazil, or 20 percent of its loans to that country, as
regulatory authorities had recently advised banks to do.
   For the first six months, Citicorp earned $479 million, or $1.24
a share, down 48 percent from $924 million, or $2.63 a share, a
year earlier.
   The first-half figures for 1989 included a $77 million after-tax
gain from the sale of property in Tokyo and $154 million in revenue
from Brazilian cash payments that since have been suspended.
   By the end of the quarter, Citicorp had assets of $227.8
billion, up 3 percent from $221.3 billion a year earlier.

   Chemical Banking said it earned $113.1 million, or $1.02 per
share, in the three months ended June 30 compared with $128.6
million, or $1.65 a share, a year earlier.
   The company said its results reflected a slight dip in net
interest income and a bigger decline in non-interest income, due to
lower gains from venture capital activities.
   But results from the company's Texas Commerce Bancshares
subsidiary improved sharply, with earnings up to $24.1 million from
$3.2 million.
   Chemical reported writeoffs on loans to Brazil and Argentina of
$268.2 million, citing regulatory directives.
   For the first half, Chemical earned $264.8 million, up 7.4
percent from $246.5 million a year earlier. But earnings per share
fell to $2.57 from $3.14, because more shares were outstanding this
year than last.

<HEAD>Manufacturers Hanover</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Manufacturers Hanover said it earned $33 million, or 31 cents a
share, down from $106 million, or $1.87 a share, a year earlier.
   The results reflected an after-tax restructuring charge of $60
million, slower corporate finance activity and shaky Third World
loans.
   The company wrote off $450 million in loans to Brazil and
Argentina in the quarter.
   For the first six months, Manufacturers Hanover earned $129
million, or $1.51 a share, down from $209 million, or $3.70 a
share, a year earlier.

   San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said it earned $232.4 million,

   It cited a $116.5 million pretax gain from establishment of a
joint venture with Nikko Securities Co. Ltd., Wells Fargo-Nikko
Investment Advisors.
   In the first six months, net income was $392.2 million, or $7.45

a year earlier.

   Chairman J. Carter Bacot said the economic environmernt prompted
the company to increase chargeoffs, write down real estate holdings
and boost its allowance for loan losses. But he said net interest
income rose 7 percent.
   For the first half, Bank of New York earned $172.7 million, or
$2.28 a share, down 19.8 percent from $215.4 million, or $3.05 a

<HEAD>Du Pont-Kansai Venture Will Supply Paint for Transplant Automakers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TROY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The largest U.S. maker of auto finishes and
Japan's largest coatings manufacturer said Tuesday they'll launch a
joint venture to supply paint to overseas automakers' U.S. plants.
   Du Pont already supplies finishes for the North American
operations of Japanese and Korean automakers and parts suppliers
with technical collaboration from Kansai Paint Co., Du Pont
spokesman Terrence Q. Cressy said.
   Effective Aug. 1, the joint venture, Du Pont-Kansai Automotive
Coatings Co., will develop and market finishes from primers to
topcoats and clearcoats to the transplant automakers.
   Du Pont will own 60 percent of the company, which will start
with about 120 employees. Kansai will own 40 percent and provide
marketing and technical support in Japan.
   The venture will be started with a $5 million investment of
capital. It will use existing Du Pont manufacturing plants, offices
and laboratories in Troy and Kansai laboratories in Japan, Cressy
said.
   Du Pont Automotive Products markets more than 100 product lines
such as finishes, plastics, composites and chemicals and had $3
billion in sales to the auto industry in 1989.
   Kansai makes automotive finishes as well as coatings for the
construction, appliance and marine industries and had 1989 sales of
about $1 billion. The joint venture is expected to have sales of
$40 million in its first year, Cressy said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar weakened Tuesday on worldwide
currency markets after the government reported a widening U.S.
trade deficit during May.
   Gold prices also declined here and abroad.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $362 a troy ounce, down $1.30 from late Monday.
Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at
$361.40 an ounce, off $1.10.
   Currency dealers said the dollar was pressured in part by a
Commerce Department report Tuesday that showed May's trade deficit
jumped to $7.73 billion from a revised $7.31 billion. The increase
was due to a big increase in imports of oil and cars.
   Dealers keep a close watch on trade figures since they often
have an impact on the dollar. For instance, dealers worry that a
rise in imports will place downward pressure on the dollar in order
to enhance the sale of exports.
   Earl I. Johnson, a trader at Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago, said
technical factors also played a role in the dollar's decline
Tuesday.
   ``It just lost the upside momentum,'' he said.
   Johnson said traders were now awaiting Wednesday's scheduled
congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
on monetary policies.
   In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar closed
at 148.20 Japanese yen, down from 148.43 late Monday. It traded at
148.32 yen in London, and at 147.80 yen in New York, down from
148.15 yen.
   The dollar was weaker against the British pound compared with
Monday's levels. Sterling cost $1.8115 in London, up from $1.8040,
and $1.8165 in New York, up from $1.8033.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
quotes, included: 1.6440 West German marks, down from 1.6545;
1.4048 Swiss francs, down from 1.4180; 5.5155 French francs, down
from 5.5500; 1,204.25 Italian lire, down from 1,211.00; and 1.15295
Canadian dollars, down from 1.15865.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Monday: 1.6455 German
marks, down from 1.6535; 1.4065 Swiss francs, down from 1.4165;
5.5210 French francs, down from 5.5460; 1.8552 Dutch guilders, down
from 1.8640; 1,205.12 Italian lire, down from 1,210.75; and 1.1562
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1587.
   The late bid price of gold in London was $361.25 an ounce, down
from $362.75 Monday. Gold fell to $361.50 an ounce in Zurich from
$362.70.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 75 cents to close at a bid of
$361.15 an ounce.
   Silver prices also weakened. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.814 a troy ounce, down from
$4.847 Monday. Silver fell 6 cents in London to $4.83 an ounce.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Figures Agree to Testify</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Key figures in a Senate probe of the
Bluebonnet Savings bailout have agreed to testify before a Senate
committee, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said Tuesday.
   James. M. Fail, a Phoenix insurance executive who bought 15
failed Texas savings and loans with $70 million in loans _ putting
up just $1,000 of his own money _ dropped his previous objetions to
testify, Metzenbaum said.
   Robert J. Thompson, a former congressional liaison to President
Bush when he was vice president, and M. Danny Wall, former chairman
of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, also dropped previous
objections to testify.
   Metzenbaum, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's
subcommittee on antitrust, monopolies and business rights, said
they would testify at hearings July 30 and Aug. 6.
   His panel held a hearing last week into the purchase of the
failed thrifts by Fail, who consolidated them into what is now
operating as Bluebonnet Savings Bank of Dallas. Metzenbaum said the
purchases received an estimated $1.8 billion in federal subsidies.
   According to documents released by the panel, Thompson borrowed
more than $500,000 from Fail thorugh Bluebonnet and Fail's
insurance companies.
   Metzenbaum said last week that a letter from Thompson prompted
Wall to arrange a meeting with federal regulators to put together a
bailout deal for Fail.
   He questioned whether Thompson's political connections and
friendship influenced the outcome of bidding on the failed thrifts
before federal regulators.
   Metzenbaum had threatened to issue subpoenas for the reluctant
witnesses.
   An attorney for Fail, Stanley M. Brand, last week challenged the
jursidiction of the Metzenbaum panel to look into S&amp;L matters. But
in announcing the agreement to testify, Metzenbaum said Fail had
retained a new lawyer.
   Metzenbaum said negotiations were under way to obtain the
voluntary testimony of another witness, Thomas K. Pennington of
Fort Wayne, Ind., a former insurance company president, who may
have information about the deal.

<HEAD>Merrill Lynch Reports 2nd Quarter Earnings Gain; PaineWebber
Profits Slip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. reported Tuesday that its
second-quarter earnings rose 13 percent as a restructuring
continued to produce positive results.
   Another investment firm, PaineWebber Group Inc., said its profit
fell nearly 3 percent as its investment banking business remained
slow.
   Merrill Lynch said it earned $74.1 million, or 64 cents per
share, up from $65.7 million, or 58 cents per share, in the second
three months of 1989.
   Revenue fell 1 percent to $2.87 billion from $2.9 billion a year
earlier. However, the company said revenue rose in the latest
quarter when compared with first quarter 1990 results.
   Last year's results were adjusted to delete earnings of the
company's real estate subsidiary, which was divested during the
third quarter of 1989.
   PaineWebber said it earned $14.6 million, down from $15.1
million a year earlier. However, quarterly earnings per share rose
to 35 cents from 33 cents a year earlier as the investment firm had
fewer shares outstanding in the 1990 quarter.
   Revenue increased 8 percent to $468.2 million from $433 million.

<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch said its earnings reflected the results of its
restructuring, which was undetaken to lower costs. Operating
expenses were down 4 percent, while total expenses were off 2
percent, the company said.
   The restructuring includes the elimination of 3,000 jobs by the
end of this year and the divestiture of several product lines and
businesses. Merrill Lynch took a fourth-quarter 1989 charge of $470
million to pay for the restructuring.
   Other investment firms, hurt by the slowdown on Wall Street
since the 1987 crash, have also been cutting back.
   The company said its investment banking revenue was up 8 percent
from the year-earlier period and 31 percent from the first quarter.
Corporate underwriting and advisory services revenue offset a
decline in revenue from the firm's mergers and acquisitions
activities.
   Revenues from asset management, insurance and custodial
activities also increased during the quarter, but revenues from
commissions and Merrill Lynch's own transactions declined.
   For the first half of the year, Merrill Lynch earned $115.4
million, or 98 cents per share, up 14 percent from $101.2 million,
or 87 cents a share, in the first half of 1989. Revenue fell 2.9
percent to $5.53 billion from $5.7 billion.

<HEAD>PaineWebber</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PaineWebber Chairman Donald Marron said the company's results
were hurt by lower earnings from merchant banking investments and
the industrywide slowdown in investment banking.
   He also blamed increased costs from litigation settlements for
the decline.
   PaineWebber reported first-half earnings of $25.4 million, or 55
cents, up 5 percent from $24.3 million, or 44 cents, during the
first six months of 1989.
   First-half revenue totaled $894.3 million, up from $830 million
a year earlier.

<HEAD>Dow Average Finishes Shy of 3000 Again, Unchanged from Monday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones average took a roller-coaster ride
Tuesday, careening into the magical 3,000-plus zone for the third
straight day and screeching to a halt at exactly the same point of
24 hours earlier: 2,999.75.
   Wall Street's best-known barometer confounded even the most
cynical traders, who have attached little significance to what they
call the hype over the Dow index's prolonged flirtation with a
3,000 close.
   The last time the index finished at exactly the same close for
two straight sessions was on June 16 and 17 of 1987, at 2,407.35.
There have been numerous other times when it has closed within a
point of the previous day's finish.
   As in the Friday and Monday sessions, the Dow average seesawed
at the 3,000 level for part of the day, moving on any big trade
involving one or more of the 30 blue-chip stocks that make up the
index.
   In the broader market Tuesday, stock prices finished largely
lower in slow trading. Other indices that measure a more expansive
range of stocks generally declined.
   The market had little reaction to two government economic
reports this morning, analysts said.
   The nation's trade deficit climbed to $7.73 billion in May from
a revised April imbalance of $7.31 billion. Meanwhile, industrial
production rose 0.4 percent in June and plant capacity utilitzation
increased 0.2 percentage point to 83.5 percent.

<HEAD>Court Approves Employment Contract Rejection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET L. CAPPIELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ames Department Stores Inc. won approval from a
federal bankruptcy judge on Tuesday to reject employment contracts
totaling about $3.3 million for three former executives.
   The ruling by Judge Howard C. Buschman means the three, who
stepped down after the troubled retailer filed for protection from
its creditors, will have to line up with other unsecured creditors
if they want to collect anything they say is due them under the
contracts.
   They would recover the same percentage of what is owed them as
other unsecured creditors when a bankruptcy reorganization plan is
approved by the court.
   The former executives include former chief executive officer
Peter Hollis, whose contract guaranteed him a salary of $700,000 a
year through Jan. 31, 1993.
   The others are Leslie Dietzman, former executive vice president
of merchandising, whose contract was for $325,000 a year through
1992, and Jeffrey Dentz, former executive vice president of
operations, whose contract provides for $200,000 a year through
Jan. 31, 1993.
   Federal law allows a company in bankruptcy to assume or reject
any contract it entered into before its bankruptcy filing. The law
is intended to help a company reorganize by removing obligations it
considers burdensome or no longer appropriate for its ongoing
business.
   Ames, based in Rocky Hill, Conn., filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on April 25, largely because
of problems stemming from its $788 million acquisition of the Zayre
discount store chain in 1988.
   Hollis resigned a few days after the company filed for
protection. Dietzman and Dentz resigned their positions but have
remained with Ames, said Ames spokesman Doug Ewing.
   Ames had already stopped making payments to the executives and
none received severance payments, said another Ames spokesman,
William Roberts.
   Hollis was replaced by Stephen L. Pistner, a specialist in
turning around troubled retail companies who is being paid $1.5
million a year.
   Last month, Buschman approved the closing of more than 200
stores and authorized the company to pay $24 million to 18,000
workers who will lose their jobs.
   During Tuesday's hearing, the judge called the Ames case
troubling because of the store closings and impending layoffs.
Buschman also said the company's unsettled finances have left
38,000 remaining employees with jobs ``dependent upon factors of
which they have very little control.''
   Ames, the nation's fourth-largest discounter, has 679 stores in
the eastern United States and two distribution centers.

<TEXT>
   Crude oil prices dipped lower and gasoline and
heating oil futures closed mixed Tuesday as traders tested the
energy market to see if it could hold its recent gains.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of crude oil, fell 2 cents to $18.65 a 42-gallon barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. Later contract months either
edged lower or were unchanged.
   ``Crude is still searching for its level after the big move
up,'' said Jim Fiedler, an analyst with E.D. &amp; F. Man International
Futures Inc., referring to last week's gains, which were chalked up
amid optimism that OPEC would finally curb its runaway production.
   Tuesday's trading was volatile, with the August contract falling
to $18.11 and then surging back. Fiedler said traders were testing
the market to see how low it might go, but buyers moved in at the
low end of Tuesday's range and moved prices higher.
   He said the market was unlikely to sell off before next week's
full meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
OPEC has made some progress recently toward achieving its goal of
an average price for crude of $18 a barrel.
   Among refined products traded on the mercantile exchange, the
August contract for unleaded regular gasoline fell 0.32 cent to
64.12 cents a gallon, but later months advanced. Home heating oil
for August delivery fell 0.16 cent to 56.08 cents a gallon, but
subsequent months followed the lead of gasoline and also moved
higher.
   In natural gas trading, the August contract closed at $1.462 per
1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.495 Monday.

<HEAD>Crude Oil Prices Expected to Drop on Supply Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil futures prices were expected to retreat Wednesday,
bucking the recent trend, after an industry trade group reported an
unexpected increase in U.S. crude supplies.
   Petroleum futures ended mixed Tuesday as late buying offset a
wave of profit-taking.
   On other commodity markets Tuesday, sugar futures tumbled;
coffee futures ended mixed on news about the International Coffee
Organization; grain futures were mostly lower; and livestock and
meat futures were mixed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents lower to 3
cents higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange with the contract
for delivery in August at $18.65 a barrel; heating oil was 1.12
cents lower to .37 cent higher with August at 56.08 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .32 cent lower to .98 cent higher with August
at 64.12 cents a gallon.
   Crude prices have climbed about $2 a barrel in the past week
amid indications that OPEC members are prepared to reduce their
crude output to support prices. The cartel begins its mid-year
meeting July 26.
   After the close, the American Petroleum Institute released
weekly supply figures that showed unexpected increases in U.S.
stocks of crude and gasoline.
   Crude oil stocks, which were expected to fall by about 2.8
million barrels, rose by 4.7 million, the API said.
   Gasoline supplies, which were expected to show little change,
rose by about 2 million barrels. Supplies of distillates rose 2.1
million barrels, as expected.
   James Ritterbusch, an energy analyst for PaineWebber Inc., said
crude prices were likely to open 15 to 20 cents lower Wednesday in
reaction to the report.
   But, he said, ``It should be kept in mind that the main
fundamental force here is still the willingness on the part of OPEC
to curtail output. That still overshadows week-to-week changes in
the API numbers.''
   Sugar futures tumbled on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange amid heavy commodity-fund selling prompted by bearish
technical signals and slack demand for sugar on the world market.
   Sugar has plunged nearly 5 cents a pound since late April on
forecasts for expanding supplies that have not been matched by
significant increases in demand.
   Harry Schwartz, an analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc.,
said Monday's close below 12 cents a pound sparked computer-driven
selling that simply fed on itself.
   ``Once those machines kick in, they just generate such volume
that you can't stand in the way,'' Schwartz said. ``You've just got
to step back and let the bulldozer come through.''
   Sugar settled .42 cent to .53 cent lower with the contract for
delivery in October at 11.19 cents a pound.
   Coffee futures ended nearly unchanged in New York, erasing
moderate gains on news that members of the International Coffee
Organization had voted in favor of Brazil's request to cancel a
July 23 special meeting.
   Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, had asked for the
meeting, prompting speculation that Brazil was prepared to support
reinstatement of coffee export quotas as a price-support measure.
   Coffee futures settled .15 cent lower to 1.05 cents higher with
July at 84.20 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures ended mostly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade as forecasts for beneficial crop weather outweighed
bullish factors that included slow crop development.
   Wheat futures settled 1} cents lower to { cent higher with July
at $3.01} a bushel; corn was unchanged to 3 cents lower with July
at $2.73{ a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2 cents lower with July
at $1.19} a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 2{ cents lower with
July at $5.95 a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled .25 cent
lower to .20 cent higher with August at 75.57 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were unchanged to .30 cent lower with August at 87.20 cents
a pound; hogs were .15 cent lower to .85 cent higher with July at
63.62 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent lower to
1.53 cents higher with July at 50.50 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Finish Narrowly Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices finished narrowly mixed Tuesday as
the market shrugged off new reports on trade and industrial
production and looked toward Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's testimony before Congress.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond lost 1-16 point, or 60
cents per $1,000 face amount. Its yield held at 8.45 percent, the
same as Monday.
   Market watchers said dealings were moderate, but traders
appeared hesitant in advance of Greenspan's testimony Wednesday
before a congressional committee on the central bank's view of
economic conditions.
   ``People are waiting for Greenspan,'' said Gary Schlossberg,
senior economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. ``They want
a better read on what the follow-up to the Fed's recent easing will
be.''
   Greenspan surprised the markets last week when he told a Senate
Banking Committee that the central bank was ready to offset an
emerging credit squeeze.
   Traders widely interpreted Fed actions the next day to inject
more reserves into the banking system as a relaxation of its credit
policy.
   The move was followed by a quarter-point decline to 8 percent in
the federal funds rate, the interest rate that banks charge each
other for overnight loans. The federal funds rate finished at 8
percent, unchanged from late Monday.
   Also due Wednesday is a report on consumer prices in June with
many economists expecting a rise of 0.3 percent.
   In the first of two economic reports Tuesday, the government
said the U.S. trade deficit rose to $7.73 billion in May from a
revised $7.31 billion imbalance for April.
   But analysts said the result had largely been anticipated by the
credit markets, and prices failed to respond to the news.
   In another report, the government said industrial production
rose 0.4 percent in June. That was about twice as much as expected,
but traders said that report was discounted because the rise was
largely due to a heat wave that boosted utility output.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose 1-32 point, intermediate maturities were unchanged
to up 1-16 point and long-term issues were off as much as 3-32
point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index was
unavailable. It measures price movements on all outstanding
Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 3-32 point to 92{. The average yield to
maturity slipped to 7.41 percent from 7.42 percent late Monday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills auctioned Monday fell to
7.85 percent as the discount lost 2 basis points to 7.60 percent.
Yields on six-month bills auctioned Monday were 7.87 percent as the
discount fell 4 basis points to 7.48 percent. Yields on one-year
bills fell to 7.86 percent as the discount lost 2 basis points to
7.34 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.

   First-half sales rose 16 percent to $869.7 million from $749.6

   Coors beer shipments for the second quarter totaled 4.8 million
barrels, up 13.6 percent from the 4.2 million barrels shipped in
the same period a year ago. For the first half of the year, Coors
shipped a record 8.8 million barrels of beer, compared with 7.3

   Polaroid Corp. said Tuesday that net
earnings were down nearly $10 million in the second quarter of 1990
compared with the same period a year ago, in part because of slow
domestic sales.
   Earnings were $32.9 million, or 45 cents a share, on revenue of
$475.6 million. For the same period in 1989, the company reported
earnings of $42.7 million, or 62 cents a share, on revenue of
$486.6.
   Profits for 1990 to date fell to $64.7 million from $68.6
million in the same period in 1989. U.S. sales were off by 10
percent while international sales increased 8 percent, officials
said.
   ``The continuing uncertainty in the worldwide business climate
... adversely affected second-quarter results,'' said I.
MacAllister Booth, Polaroid's CEO and president, in a written
statement.
   ``The continued commitment to invest in Polaroid's future along
with the impact of the uncertainty of worldwide economic conditions
have led us to lower expectations for the year,'' he said. ``We
expect that Polaroid will achieve operating profits that are flat
to moderately down from last year's levels.''
   The photography giant has been restructuring and trimming
operations since successfully fending off a takeover bid by
Shamrock Holdings, which cost the company $151.9 million in 1988.
   Polaroid supplies instant photography, cameras and films, as
well as conventional films, videotapes and electronic visual
communication products to family, business and technical and
industrial markets.

<HEAD>RTC Sold $536 Million in Real Estate in First Five Months of Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators sold $536 million of real
estate seized from failed thrifts in Texas and Oklahoma in the
first five months of this year, but still hold properties worth
$7.6 billion.
   That doesn't include what the government may gain through
continued failures.
   But real estate experts said Tuesday a credit crunch, and the
government's reluctance to help finance purchases, are making the
thrift bailout effort more difficult.
   ``We basically have no financing in the real estate market,''
J.R. Kimball, a real estate appraiser from Fort Worth, testified at
the first meeting of the Resolution Trust Corp.'s Region 4 Advisory
Board.
   ``Banks don't want to make real estate loans, and the savings
and loans are virtually non-existent. ... Everything's still on a
downward slope,'' he said.
   ``Prices are declining ... as the market's continuing to erode
with or without financing from the RTC,'' said Elizabeth B. Sink,
president of Real Estate-Asset Information Management Systems Inc.
in Dallas.
   ``I don't think we've seen the end of the (downward) spiral,''
she said.
   The RTC was created last year to oversee the thrift bailout,
estimated to cost taxpayers between $300 billion and $500 billion.
The advisory boards were designed to provide guidance to the
regional RTC offices from industry experts.
   Tuesday's meeting of the Region 4 board, which oversees Texas
and Oklahoma, is the second to be held nationally. Like a previous
meeting in New York, few people other than witnesses and RTC
officials attended.
   Carmen Sullivan, the RTC's regional director, told the board the
agency now controls 122 thrifts in the two states, including 48
that have been resolved by selling deposits and some assets from
the failed institutions.
   As of May 31, she said, the RTC had retained 17,000 assets in
the two states worth $7.6 billion, all but $135 million of it in
Texas. Of those properties, 11,000 are single-family residences
valued at about $2 billion, 4,400 parcels of vacant land valued at
$3.6 billion, and 1,600 commercial properties valued at $2 billion.
   Of the $536 million sold this year, $248 million was in
single-family residences, $98 million in vacant land, and the rest
in commercial property, she said.
   All of last year, government regulators sold off $579 million of
thrift real estate, she said.
   Several board members and witnesses questioned Ms. Sullivan on
the problems caused by scant financing, and some board members
indicated they backed government guaranteeing of loans.
   But Ms. Sullivan said, ``I don't believe that we're necessarily
turning away any creditworthy purchasers.''
   Regulations allow the RTC to finance sales under certain
restrictions, and she said the agency provided $16 million in
residential financing and $10 million in commercial financing
during the first quarter of the year.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said
Tuesday that Congress should consider delaying action on the 1990
farm bill until a budget agreement is reached by White House and
congressional negotiators.
   ``Certainly that would be the most propitious way to handle the
matter,'' Yeutter told reporters.
   Otherwise, Congress might have to write two farm bills, he said,
indicating an agreement on the overall federal budget may require
changes in farm programs not anticipated in the pending legislation.
   But he said he has not asked any members of Congress directly to
delay farm bill action.
   ``The administration is hiding behind the budget and trying to
kill the farm bill,'' said Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ``Since the budget summit may take months to
complete, the administration's proposal sets the stage from a
one-year farm bill extension, so that American farm policy would be
written in Geneva.''
   Leahy made a similar accusation Monday after Yeutter said he
would seek a veto of the bill if its cost isn't reduced. Yeutter is
playing a major role in U.S. efforts to get countries participating
in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks in Geneva,
Switzerland, to reduce trade distorting subsidies.
   Since discussions on the farm bill began last year, Congress has
warned Yeutter that it would not allow agriculture policy in this
country to be determined at the international negotiating table.
Leahy has said Yeutter wants a one-year bill in order to give U.S.
trade negotiators a freer hand at GATT.
   ``That's nonsense,'' said Yeutter. ``Whether we have a one,
three or five-year farm bill is fundamentally irrelevant to the
GATT process.''
   Though Yeutter has said repeatedly that he would accept a
one-year extension of current law if debate bogs down, he said
Tuesday that he expects Congress to pass a five-year bill.
   Senate leaders have said they would like to begin floor debate
on the bill this week, probably Thursday. Eighty or 90 possible
amendments are being prepared and debate could take more than a
week. In the House, the Rules Committee meets that day to determine
the procedures for the House debate, which could begin next week.
   Meanwhile, budget negotiators who have been working since
mid-May have apparently made little significant progress toward
reaching an agreement. Some have suggested that Congress will have
to return after the November election to get a budget passed.
   The Senate Agriculture Committee says the bill contains $55
billion in price supports, but Yeutter says administration figures
show that it would cost $59 billion.
   ``With the administration announcing yesterday that we're facing
a $168 billion deficit, we're not going to have money for that,''
Yeutter said. He said his office also will issue an analysis of the
House farm bill.
   Yeutter said the budget negotiators are trying to work out a
five-year economic plan, but until they reveal their proposals the
amount allowed for agriculture remains unknown.
   ``It's totally up in the air because we still do not have a
budget agreement with Congress,'' said Yeutter.
   It is widely accepted that the versions of the farm bill passed
by the House and Senate will be significantly changed in conference
committee. That committee could wait for an agreement from the
budget negotiators before polishing off the farm bill.

<HEAD>United Telecom Reports Big Earnings Drop, Delays Sprint Buyout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY STREFF BUZBEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Telecommunications Inc.'s stock
plunged Tuesday after it reported a 55 percent drop in second
quarter earnings and postponed its purchase of GTE Corp.'s stake in
its US Sprint long-distance division.
   The company also announced it would eliminate 1,000 jobs
nationwide and switch more employees to sales and customer service
jobs.
   ``We have determined that, due to the disappointing
second-quarter results, this is not the time to complete the
buyout,'' the company's chairman and chief executive, William T.
Esrey, said in a statement.
   ``We will continue to evaluate the status on a monthly basis,
and the buyout will take place when we determine the timing to be
correct,'' Esrey said.
   Shares of the Kansas City-based telecommunications company
dropped $8.75 to $29.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, a 22
percent slide. It was the most heavily traded issue, with 11.8
million shares changing hands.
   Esrey blamed the earnings drop on high overhead and one-time
costs.
   But William Deatherage, an analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
in New York, said the company wasn't achieving the level of revenue
growth it needs to keep pace with costs.
   ``Not only are they not taking market share from AT&amp;T, they're
not even growing at the industry rate, overall,'' Deatherage said.
   Analysts who had expected slightly lower earnings were surprised
by what the company reported, he said.
   ``They have not communicated to us, over the last few months,
that they were having problems of this magnitude. Therefore, it's
difficult to pinpoint the exact difficulty,'' Deatherage said.
``But there's no way they can pass off a quarter like this as an
aberration.''
   Esrey said the company did not meet its revenue goals,
particularly in customer segments such as residential and small
business.
   ``In light of increasing competition, we are aggressively
refocusing our sales efforts to place our technologically advanced
network and innovative telecommunications products and services
before potential customers,'' Esrey said.
   United Telecom had announced with great fanfare three months ago
that it would buy the share of US Sprint it did not already own for
$500 million and change its name to Sprint Corp. to capitalize on
the high profile of the nation's third-largest long-distance
company. The transaction and name change had been expected to take
place this month.
   GTE Corp., which formed US Sprint with United Telecom as a joint
venture in 1986, still owns 20 percent of the company.
   US Sprint has 8 percent of the long-distance market and trails
only industry leader American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and MCI
Communications Corp.
   The company said it earned $40.6 million, or 18 cents a share,
during the quarter ending June 30, compared with $90.5 million, or
43 cents per share, during the same quarter a year earlier.
   The company said several non-recurring charges totaling $72
million affected the performance of US Sprint. The charges included
a reserve for the workforce cuts, a writeoff in the value of
non-productive assets and reserves set aside for other unspecified
uses.
   The earnings came on revenue of $2.07 billion, compared with
$1.85 billion in the same quarter of 1989.
   US Sprint's revenue increased 19 percent to $1.24 billion, but
after the nonrecurring charges were included, the long-distance
unit lost $42 million for the quarter.
   For the first six-months of the year, United Telecom earned
$148.2 million, or 69 cents per share, compared with $166.9
million, or 79 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
   Syd Courson, a spokesman in Kansas City, said some employees
will be laid off when the 1,000 positions are eliminated, but he
did not have an exact number. Other job eliminations will come
through attrition, he said.
   The company has been looking for ways to cut costs, he said. In
addition, some positions were duplicated when United Telecom and
Sprint began consolidating their operations this spring, he said.

<HEAD>Champion Products Named Official NBA Uniform Supplier</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Champion Products, supplier of uniforms
to seven professional football teams and thousands of college
teams, has added the National Basketball Association to its lineup.
   The athletic wear manufacturer said it has been named official
supplier of game uniforms, practice wear and warm-up suits to the
NBA, beginning this season.
   The four-year agreement gives Champion the exclusive right to
sell replica NBA uniforms and practice clothes.
   ``It's the first time we've had a contract that covers an entire
league,'' company vice president Ken James said Tuesday. ``It's a
tremendous opportunity for the company.''
   Champion, a subsidiary of Sara Lee Corp. since February 1989,
already supplies uniforms and practice equipment to thousands of
high school and college teams as well as a number of NFL teams.
   Champion also has retail licenses from Major League Baseball and
the National Hockey League.
   Marketing and merchandising manager Mike Merkel would not
speculate on how much revenue the NBA agreement could provide, but
industry sources said it could generate between $14 million and $20
million in annual sales.
   Champion had sales of $250 million in 1989, the last year
independent sales figures were available.

   McGraw-Hill Inc. said Tuesday its second-quarter
earnings fell 26.7 percent from a year earlier as improved results
in financial services were offset by declines in publishing and
information services.
   The lower results also reflected higher interest expenses and
the absence of one-time gains reported last year from asset sales,
the media company said.
   Among other media companies reporting results, Park
Communications Inc. said its earnings inched higher in the second
quarter. E.W. Scripps Co. reported a quarterly loss of $162,000 due
in large part to a special charge resulting from the termination of
a joint operating agreement involving one of its newspapers. And
Pulitzer Publishing Co. said its second quarter profit fell 33.6
percent from a year ago.

   McGraw-Hill said it earned $37.2 million, or 76 cents a share,
in the three months ended June 30 compared with $50.8 million, or
$1.04 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 6.8 percent to $457.8 million from $428.4 million a
year earlier.
   The financial services segment, which includes the Standard &amp;
Poor's credit ratings operation, had an operating profit of $27.7
million, up 32 percent from a year earlier.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Joseph L. Dionne said the segment
benefitted from growing international activity, a strong
performance in municipal bond business for S&amp;P and the absence of
losses from the McGraw-Hill News Service, closed earlier this year,
and the Numerax service, which was sold.
   Operating profit at the information and publications services
segmnet fell 20 percent to $30.6 million as gains at the F.W. Dodge
and other construction information providers failed to offset
advertising declines at Business Week and Aviation Week magazines
and other operations.
   The educational and professional publishing segment posted an
operating profit of $3 million, down 55 percent due partly to
softness in healthcare magazine advertising.
   Operating profit in the broadcasting segment was flat at $9.8
million. The company owns four television stations.
   Dionne said the company should earn $3.50 to $4 a share for the
full year despite softness in advertising.
   For the first six months of the year, McGraw-Hill earned $53.7
million, or $1.10 a share, down 34.5 percent from $81.9 million, or
$1.68 a share, a year earlier.
   First-half revenue rose 7.2 percent to $877.8 million from
$818.8 million a year earlier.

   Park Communications, based in Ithaca, N.Y., said it earned $5.87
million, or 28 cents a share, for the quarter ended June 30, up
from $5.83 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Second quarter revenue slipped 1 percent to $42.8 million from
$43.2 million a year earlier.
   Chairman Roy H. Park said advertising revenue was down
throughout the newspaper business because of problems in the retail
industry.
   ``We are very pleased that we held our own,'' he said. ``We've
had to run a pretty tight ship just to stay even.''
   For the first half, Park Communications said it earned $8.68
million, or 42 cents a share, compared with $8.67 million, or 42
cents a share, a year earlier.
   First-half revenue slipped to $78.9 million from $79.8 million a
year earlier.
   Park Communications owns seven television stations, 19 radio
stations and 138 newspapers.

<HEAD>E.W. Scripps</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In Cincinnati, E.W. Scripps said its $162,000 loss contrasted
with net income of $25.2 million, or 31 cents a share, in the
second quarter of 1989.
   The latest results reflected a $36.4 million pretax charge
related to payments the company will make to Persis Corp. to
terminate a joint operating agreement between Scripps' Knoxville
News-Sentinel and The Knoxville Journal, owned by Persis.
   Under the agreement, which ends in December 1991, The
News-Sentinel provides sales, production and distribution for The
Journal.
   It said without the charge, net income for the quarter ended
June 30 would have been $23.5 million, or 31 cents per share.
   Scripps, which publishes 19 daily newspapers, said its revenue
for the quarter grew 3.4 percent to $332 million from $321 million
last year.
   ``The soft advertising environment continues to impact revenue
growth, particularly in the newspaper group,'' Lawrence A. Leser,
Scripps' president and chief executive officer, said in a news
release.
   For the first half, net income declined 76.2 percent to $9.6
million, or 12 cents a share, compared with $40.3 million, or 51
cents a share, a year earlier.
   First-half revenue rose 2.2 percent to $629.4 million from
$615.8 million a year earlier.

<HEAD>Pulitzer Publishing</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   St. Louis-based Pulitzer Publishing blamed its latest earnings
drop on declining newspaper advertising.
   Net earnings for the quarter, which ended June 30, were $4.59
million, or 44 cents a share, down from $6.92 million, or 66 cents
a share, for the same period a year earlier.
   Revenues rose to $103.8 million from last year's $103.3 million.
   Along with the soft newspaper advertising conditions, the
decreasing earnings reflected increased depreciation and
amortization connected with the acquisition of WDSU-TV in New
Orleans in December and the sale of WPTA-TV in Ft. Wayne, Ind.
   For the first half of the year, Pulitzer earned $5.5 million, or
53 cents a share, down 44 percent from $9.96 million, or 95 cents a
share, a year ago.
   Revenues for the first six months increased to $199 million from
$197.4 million.
   Pulitzer's operations include two major metropolitan dailies,
the Post-Dispatch and The Arizona Daily Star in Tucson, newspapers
and shoppers in the Chicago area and seven network-affiliated
television stations.

<HEAD>Upjohn Earnings Up 20 Percent</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   KALAMAZOO, Mich. _ A pension credit and other non-recurring
items helped push Upjohn Co.'s earnings up 20.6 percent in the
second quarter, the pharmaceutical company said Tuesday.
   The pension credit was made possible by lump-sum payments to
some Upjohn employees as part of a special early-retirement program.
   Upjohn reported net income from continuing operations of $114.1
million, or 62 cents a share, for the three months ending June 30.
For the April through June period in 1989, the company made $94.6
million, or 51 cents a share.
   Operating revenue for the quarter rose 10.5 percent to $806.5
million from $730.1 million a year earlier, the company said.
   For the first six months of the year, Upjohn said it had net
income of $228.3 million, or $1.23 a share, on operating revenue of
$1.58 billion. That compares with $197.6 million, or $1.06 a share,
on operating revenue of $1.48 billion in the first six months of
1989.
   The pension credit and other non-recurring items increased
operating income $38 million in the second quarter, the company
said.
   The oral anti-diabetes mediation Micronase, the anti-anxiety
medication Xanax and the male-pattern baldness treatment Rogaine
led a 15 percent increase in worldwide sales of human health care
products and services, the company said.
   Upjohn said its U.S. sales rose 9 percent to $487 million for
the quarter, and overseas sales rose 13 percent to $318 million,
accounting for 39 percent of the company's consolidated sales.
   Upjohn eliminated several hundred employees last year by holding
down on hiring and through the early retirement program accepted by
about 600 employees. Upjohn employs about 20,000 people worldwide,
including about 8,000 in Kalamazoo.

   Stock prices closed mostly lower Tuesday, while
for the third session the Dow Jones industrial average gyrated
above and below the 3,000 level before closing at 2,999.75 _
unchanged from Monday.
   In the broader market, prices were hurt by a series of
disappointing corporate earnings reports.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
643 up, 877 down and 519 unchanged.
   The market was unforgiving to several companies that reported
lower-than-expected earnings. Among them was United
Telecommunications, parent of US Sprint, which fell 8} to 29{ after
reporting its second-quarter profit dropped 55.1 percent.
   United Telecommunications was the most-active NYSE issue, with
11.8 million shares changing hands.
   GTE, the third most-active NYSE issue, fell } to 28\. The
company reported that its second-quarter profit rose 10.6 percent,
but the per-share profit of 54 cents was short of analysts'
expectations. At the same time, United Telecom said it was
postponing until later this year its purchase of the 19.9 percent
of Sprint owned by GTE.
   Steve Shobin, a vice president at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said the
reaction to the United Telecom report indicated ``the market is
walking on very thin ice.''
   ``Stocks are responding easily and demonstrably to bad news and,
in turn, reinforcing the skepticism of the public,'' he said.
   The United Telecom earnings report helped send the Dow average
down from its morning high of 3,010.64. Traders said the market was
looking for an excuse to take profits by selling shares.
   Later, the Dow retreated further in a wave of selling sparked by
computerized trading tied to the index futures market, Shobin said,
with the Dow dropping as low as 2,978.71.
   But in the final half hour of trading, the Dow rebounded more
than 20 points as the direction of computer-driven trading changed
and buy orders kicked in, he said. The Dow briefly went above 3,000
before closing just under that level.
   It was the third session the Dow exceeded 3,000, but it never
has closed at that figure. The close Monday and Tuesday of 2,999.75
is a record high.
   Gains in several blue-chip issues helped boost the Dow.
Coca-Cola rose 1~ to 47\ after reporting its second-quarter
earnings jumped 18.6 percent. Chevron rose 1 to 75~ after Pennzoil
said it plans to increase its 8.8 percent Chevron stake to just
under 10 percent.
   Among other blue chips, AT&amp;T fell &lsqb; to 37, IBM fell 1| to 120}
and Philip Morris rose \ to 50{.
   The last time the Dow closed unchanged was March 14, 1989, when
it ended at 2,306.25.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 176.79 million
shares, up from 149.43 million Monday.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 216.40 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $13.690 billion, or 0.39
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.64 to 200.49.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.79 to 435.58, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index fell 1.43 to 367.52.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
closed at 464.48, down 5.12. At the American Stock Exchange, the
market value index fell 1.19 to 364.39.

Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAYNE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Cyanamid Co. reported Tuesday a 4
percent increase in second quarter profits from continuing
operations, despite start-up costs of a titanium dioxide plant and
shutdown expenses for an ammonia facility overseas.
   Net earnings were $111 billion, or $1.13 per share, compared
with $107 billion, or $1.05 per share, in the second quarter of
1989.
   Second quarter earnings came on sales of $1.23 billion, a 6
percent increase over 1989 second-quarter sales of $1.16 billion,
the company said.
   The company incurred one-time costs in the second quarter with
the closing of an ammonia facility in Welland, Canada, and the
starting of a titanium dioxide plant in Rijswijk, The Netherlands.
The titanium dioxide facility is a joint venture with
Billiton-Netherlands B.V.
   Net earnings for the first six months of the year increased 5.3
percent over six months net earnings in 1989, the biotechnology and
chemical company said. Six-month net earnings were $202 billion, or
$2.14 per share, compared to net earnings for the first half of
1989 of $192 billion, or $1.88 a share.
   Net sales increased 5.5 percent to $2.4 billion compared with
net sales of $2.26 billion for the first six months of 1989.
Second-quarter and six-month figures did not include Cyanamid's
Shulton Group, which the company announced earlier this year it was
selling. The division produces consumer products, including
toiletries and fragrances.

<TEXT>
   Intel Corp., a manufacturer of
microcomputer components, Tuesday reported a 72 percent increase in
net income for the second quarter as sales increased 30 percent.
   Net income was $171 million in the second quarter, which ended
June 30, 1990, up from $99 million in the same quarter last year.
Revenue was $968 million in the second quarter this year, a 30
percent increase over the $747 million in revenue reported a year
ago.
   Earnings per share increased from 53 cents a year ago to 84
cents in the second quarter of 1990, the company reported.
   The increased income was attributed to demand for components
such as the 32-bit microprocessors, high-density EPROMs and
microcontrollers, Intel said.
   During the second quarter, Intel announced it would open a new
chip manufacturing plant in Ireland and keep open its Livermore
plant to meet demand for its components.

   GTE Corp.'s earnings increased 11 percent
in the second quarter of the year on increased sales of
telecommunications products and services, the nation's largest
independent telephone company said Tuesday.
   Second quarter earnings were $364 million, or 54 cents per
share, compared with $329 million, or 49 cents per share, for the
same quarter last year, the company said in a press release.
   Revenue rose 6 percent to $4.6 billion, compared with $4.3
billion for the second quarter last year, the company said.
   GTE's telecommunications products and services business had
revenue of $879 million for the second quarter, a 23 percent
increase from $716 million for the second quarter of 1989.
   The increase reflects higher sales of cellular mobile telephone
services, government communication systems and directory
advertising, the release said.
   Sales of GTE's electrical products fell to $548 million from
$551 million a year ago, primarily because of sluggish sales in the
United States, according to the company.
   Contel Corp., the nation's third-largest independent telephone
company, announced July 12 that it had agreed to be taken over by
GTE in a stock swap valued at $6 billion.
   The merger is subject to the approval of both companies'
stockholders, and by regulatory agencies.
   It would result in the country's second-largest cellular phone
system operator after McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.

   The House narrowly defeated a constitutional
amendment Tuesday to balance the budget after opponents said it was
a gimmick to hide the failure of Congress and the president to cut
the huge federal deficits.
   The House voted 279-150 in favor of the amendment, but it was
seven votes short of the two-thirds required to propose a
constitutional change.
   President Bush, meanwhile, declared that the worsening federal
deficit meant ``the time for game-playing is over'' and set a
budget meeting with congressional leaders at the White House on
Wednesday.
   Backers of the amendment said they had expected defeat. Rep.
Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, said either way, Congress needed to make
tough choices to end a decade of huge increases in the national
debt, which now tops $3.1 trillion.
   ``It's up to us folks,'' he said. ``If this amendment passes,
it's going to take guts. If it doesn't pass, it's going to take
guts.''
   ``None of us want to face the tough decisions at hand, but faced
they must be,'' said Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, co-sponsor of the
amendment.
   The amendment would, beginning in 1995, prohibit government
spending from exceeding revenues, or any increase in government
borrowing, unless the requirements are waived by a three-fifths
vote of each chamber of Congress.
   The House defeated, 244-184, a proposal by Rep. Joe Barton,
R-Texas, to extend the super-majority threshold to any proposal
containing a tax increase. Barton said without his amendment, a
balanced budget requirement would create a bias toward raising
taxes.
   The balanced budget amendment would ``send a message to the
economic markets of our country that this Congress is serious''
about fiscal responsibility, said Rep. Marilyn Lloyd, D-Tenn.
   Bush, in a letter Monday, urged support of the amendment along
with changes in the budget process to give the president more
power, including the line-item veto.
   ``Together with political courage and discipline, these tools
are vital to solving the problem of budget deficits,'' Bush said.
   Bush on Tuesday told a group of magazine publishers in the White
House the ``time for game playing is over'' and he would push
harder for a compromise with Congress on a deficit-reduction plan.
   The House last voted on a balanced budget amendment in 1982,
when it fell short by more than 40 votes. Support for the amendment
has grown since then, largely because of growing frustration over
the deficits and the failure of statutes such as Gramm-Rudman law
to solve them.
   But opponents Tuesday said the amendment was a sham, that its
requirements could easily be dodged, and that delaying the
effective date to 1995 amounted to passing the buck.
   ``This so-called balanced budget amendment is the amendment for
the truly religious because the balance to which it refers occurs
only in the hereafter,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.
   ``We get the headlines today, someone else gets the headache of
making it work tomorrow,'' said Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill.
   Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, said the amendment would solve none
of the nations fiscal problems except give the courts an excuse to
begin dictating the nation's fiscal policy. ``Judicial tyranny
waiting to happen,'' he said.
   President Bush, like Ronald Reagan before him, has not proposed
a balanced budget and has touted the amendment so long as it
doesn't take effect too quickly. The White House said it supported
the House version, although it objected to language making it
harder to raise fees for government services or to increase
government borrowing.
   The delay in the effective date of the House version, until
1995, was in response to concerns expressed by the administration
and others that reducing the deficit too quickly would risk damage
to the economy.
   The president's budget office estimated on Monday that the
deficit in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, would reach $168.8
billion unless spending is cut or taxes raised. That figure would
trigger automatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law of
nearly $105 billion.
   And the new administration estimate does not include the tens of
billions of dollars needed for the bailout of the savings and loan
industry.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu said Bush's meeting with
congressional leaders on Wednesday afternoon would focus on the
budget talks, which have been progressing slowly despite the
president's reversal of his ``no new taxes'' pledge.
   ``The agenda's a very simple one: let's get a solution to the
deficit, get a package to come out of the summit and move
forward,'' Sununu said.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls, Stock Prices Shed Moderately in Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell in early trading against the
Japanese yen Wednesday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange dropped moderately.
   The dollar started trading at 147.56 yen, down 0.64 yen from
Tuesday's close of 148.20 yen. It finished at 147.80 yen in New
York.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's slide followed its retreat in
New York, partly because of an increase in the U.S. trade deficit
in May.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported the nation's trade deficit
for May increased to $7.73 billion from a revised $7.31 billion in
April. The government said increases in oil and auto imports offset
the second-highest level of exports on record.
   A dealer with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank said the dollar's weakness as
a whole was in line with trends of declining U.S. interest rates
since last week.
   ``It's somewhat difficult now to buy dollars'' over prospects of
further declines in interest rates, said the dealer who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   He said many market players were awaiting Wednesday's testimony
by U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan before
Congress.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues lost 91.38 points, or 0.27 percent, to move to 33,080.90 in
the first 30 minutes of trading. The index gained 150.55 points on
Tuesday.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds edged up to 86.87 points, from Tuesday's
close of 86.84. The yield stood at 7.225 percent, down from the
previous day's 7.23 percent.

   The Senate voted Tuesday to speed up action on
a major job discrimination bill, brushing aside warnings from
critics that the measure would lead to minority hiring quotas.
   The action brought an outcry from Republican Leader Bob Dole
that the bill was ``being rammed down our throats'' while White
House Chief of Staff John Sununu accused sponsors of backing out on
a compromise reached last week.
   ``If we're going to be treated like a bunch of bums on this side
of the aisle, there won't be any agreements on anything,'' said
Dole after the 62-38 vote to limit debate to 30 hours.
   Provisions of the bill sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., range from a ban on racial harassment in the workplace to
punitive damages for victims of intentional discrimination.
   The sharpest clashes have come over a provision that would make
it easier to challenge hiring practices of companies whose work
forces do not mirror the racial and ethnic makeup of the local
labor pool.
   Such employers, if challenged in court, would have to prove that
the hiring practices that led to the composition of the work force
were justified by business necessity. That would reverse the most
controversial of five 1989 Supreme Court rulings on job bias
addressed by the bill.
   The justices, in a case involving a salmon cannery in Alaska,
held that it was up to those who file such lawsuits to prove the
practices they objected to were not motivated by business necessity.
   The Bush administration, business groups and some GOP senators
say the bill would lead to employers using hiring quotas to avert
any chance they would incur the costs, including damage awards, of
job discrimination suits.
   After voting to set the time limit, the Senate debated an
alternative version of the legislation sponsored by Sen. Nancy
Landon Kassebaum, R-Kan. But it broke off action for the night with
the administration and sponsors agreeing to negotiate some more
while still allowing the clock to run on the 30-hour deadline.
   ``I think everybody agrees its worth one last shot, one last
effort,'' Dole said as the Senate recessed. Bush said last week he
was encouraged by the negotiations after Kennedy and Sununu
appeared to reach a compromise.
   ``I thought we had an agreement,'' Sununu said. ``The senator
came in yesterday after we had an agreement, and then we didn't
have it anymore.''
   He said President Bush would continue to press for a civil
rights agreement but would veto any measure that would lead to
hiring quotas.
   At a photo opportunity session earlier, Sununu said in answer a
question on the chances of an agreement: ``We had one Thursday.
They reneged on it.''
   Kennedy said on the Senate floor, however, the ``president never
claimed that there had been a deal and the situation was locked up
... and neither did I.'' If anyone said otherwise, he said, ``They
misspoke.''
   Kennedy noted the indignation of critics of the bill who argued
they needed more than 30 hours to purge it of what they viewed as
quota provisions and other objectionable features.
   ``I wish we could see that kind of indignation about the kind of
unfairness that is taking place at job locations all over this
country against women and minorities,'' Kennedy said.
   Dole grimly acknowledged the defection of eight Republicans on
the roll call. Raising his voice, he suggested that perhaps someone
else should be found to serve as minority leader.
   ``Some of our Republicans _ they know better than the
leadership,'' he grumbled.
   Dole complained that sponsors were trying to portray Republicans
as opposed to civil rights because they voted in large part against
limiting debate. He said GOP senators wanted a civil rights bill
but remained concerned about the quota issues and other features of
the bill.
   ``To have this rammed down our throats because it didn't please
the senator from Massachusetts ... it seems to me that we're going
to be in for a long, hot summer,'' Dole said.
   To drive home the notion that Republicans did not want to stand
in the way of civil rights, Dole brought a sudden, stunned silence
in the Senate by offering to approve the measure immediately on a
voice vote immediately.
   ``Now we have a chance to pass this historic legislation right
now,'' Dole declared. ``We can finish in 20 minutes.''
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, a proponent of the
bill, objected to three separate offers by Dole to pass the measure
immediately. Mitchell declared that senators who were scheduled to
offer amendments under the 30-hour time limit were entitled to a
hearing on them.
   But Dole said the Democratic reluctance to pass the bill
immediately proved that it had some troublesome features that even
proponents wanted out before they went home to explain the measure
to voters.
   ``Now we're told we can't vote because we have some fellas stuck
out here on a limb and we need some cosmetic surgery,'' Dole said.
   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., one of the Republicans who
supported limiting debate, said he didn't believe ``that what we
have just done furthers the cause of enacting this into law.''
   ``I am satisfied with the bill as is and I will vote for the
bill as is, but it is clear that this bill is not going to become
law unless the president agrees to it,'' Danforth said.
   Republicans joining Danforth in the vote to limit debate were:
James Jeffords of Vermont, a co-sponsor of the bill; William Cohen
of Maine; David Durenberger of Minnesota; Mark Hatfield of Oregon;
John Heinz and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania; and Bob Packwood of
Oregon.
   The one Democrat to vote against limiting debate was James Exon,
D-Neb.

<HEAD>Great American Bank to Sell Portion of Operations to Wells Fargo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Struggling Great American Bank has agreed to
sell its 130 branches in California to Wells Fargo &amp; Co. for $492
million.
   The San Diego-based thrift, the country's eighth largest savings
and loan, has been struggling against a rising tide of losses since
the fourth quarter of 1988. Great American acquired a widening loan
problem along from an Arizona thrift it bought in 1986.
   Great American spokesman Brian Luscomb said Tuesday the thrift's
employment would drop from 3,563 to about 1,700. It was unclear
Tuesday how many of Great American's employees in California would
be hired by Wells Fargo.
   Losses during 1989 hit a staggering $263.4 million and left
Great American unable to meet minimum federal capital standards.
The thrift must raise $350 million by the end of the year to avoid
a government takeover.
   The proposed deal is subject to approval by shareholders and
federal regulators. The California branches have assests of $5.9
billion.
   The deal with Wells Fargo would pare down Great American's $15.4
billion in assets to between $8 billion and $9 billion. Great
American would retain 81 branch offices in Washington, Arizona and
Colorado.
