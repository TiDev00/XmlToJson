   Mourners bade farewell Friday to a nun killed
in a Nicaraguan ambush, saying her life was forfeited to violence
in a world that needs peacemakers.
   Nearly 300 friends and family members attended a memorial
service at the home church of Sister Maureen Courtney, one of two
nuns killed Monday evening when their pickup truck was attacked by
assailants in northeastern Nicaragua.
   Some wept as a coffin draped in red roses was borne between two
rows of women parishioners.
   ``We feel a right to be angry at this senseless death, this loss
of innocent human life,'' Archbishop Rembert Weakland of Milwaukee
told mourners at an evening service in Fond du Lac, about 50 miles
north of Milwaukee.
   ``If we are encouraged by their example to move from here to
make this world a place of peace and love through the mutual
service we give to one another, then senselessness will be turned
into fullness of life,'' he said.
   About 20 Nicaraguans who have worked with the Sisters of St.
Agnes sang a Spanish hymn, ``Pescador de Hombres,'' and several
prayers were said in Spanish.
   Sister Courtney, 45, a Milwaukee native, and Sister Teresa
Rosales, 24, of Nicaragua were members of the Fond du Lac-based
Sisters of St. Agnes. Auxiliary Bishop Pablo Schmitz of Bluefields,
Nicaragua, a native of Fond du Lac, and Sister Francisca Colomer,
24, of Nicaragua were wounded in the attack.
   Sister Courtney's body was flown to the United States on
Thursday night. An earlier service for her was in Milwaukee, and a
private burial was scheduled Saturday.
   The Rev. Tom Wittliff, a Roman Catholic priest and family
friend, told mourners in Milwaukee that Sister Courtney was a
victim whose sacrifice would become a Eucharist for others.
   ``On that road in Nicaragua, whatever traps were set, whatever
shots were shot, the spirit of Christ was being continued,''
Wittliff said. ``The world has enough of the military, it has
enough clowns. What the world needs now is people who will give.''
   Sister Jean Salchert, a member of the order, prayed: ``Give us
the courage to put our life on the line. Where there is war and
violence, may we be peacemakers.''
   Two protesters carried signs outside. One said, ``Stop the
bloodshed and Contra aid.'' Another read: ``Contra Aid, Murder by
Proxy.''
   Sisters of St. Agnes in Nicaragua said evidence at the scene
implicates Contra rebels in the ambush. The U.S.-backed Contras are
fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government.
   The Nicaraguan government has blamed the ambush on the Contras,
although a spokesman for the rebels on Wednesday denied any
involvement in the killings.
   Sister Collette Hartman, a friend of Sister Courtney's, said
members of the International Commission for the Protection and
Promotion of Human Rights were investigating the ambush.

<HEAD>Former HUD Accountant Pleads Guilty to Federal Theft Charge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former accountant for the Department of Housing
and Urban Development pleaded guilty Friday to one count of theft
from the U.S. government for allegedly embezzling $1 million from a
HUD rent-subsidy program.
   Douglas R. Turner entered the plea before U.S. District Court
Judge James Carrigan as part of an agreement that called for three
other theft counts to be dropped in exchange for his guilty plea.
   Turner, 38, could be sentenced to a maximum 10 years in prison
and fined up to $250,000. No sentencing date has been set.
   Turner was indicted Aug. 29 for allegedly embezzling $1 million
from HUD and putting the funds to his own use. He has been free on
personal recognizance bond since that time.
   Turner was a $28,000-a-year supervisory accountant in HUD's
Denver regional office.
   Prosecutors say Turner used a government computer to
electronically transfer about $1 million from the HUD Section 8
rent-subsidy program to the bank account of a real estate company
he owned, Green View Developers Inc. Green View Developers was not
eligible to participate in the program.
   The transfers occurred between December 1988 and May 1989, and
turned up during a routine audit, prosecutors said.
   Investigators said Turner apparently found an account number for
a housing project once used by HUD and made charges to that account
to make it appear the Section 8 program funds were being spent
legitimately.
   He allegedly used this system to wire money on at least four
occasions from the U.S. Treasury into the Colorado State Bank
account of Green View Developers.
   When the investigators began investigating Turner's role in the
affair, they allegedly found a burgeoning stock portfolio, recently
purchased real estate and a $500,000 custom home under
construction. They said Turner also bought a car with the money.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Allison said FBI and HUD
investigators have so far seized property worth $470,000 from
Turner that will be used as restitution in the case.
   The Justice Department has also filed a $1 million civil lawsuit
against Turner in an effort to recover the remainder of the
embezzled funds.
   The civil and criminal actions are a cooperative effort to
recover the money, with the $470,000 already seized to be the only
restitution in the criminal proceeding, said Turner's attorney,
Dianna DeGette.
   Turner's case emerged at the height of concern over allegations
of widespread fraud in the Denver HUD operation. U.S. Attorney Mike
Norton said that investigation is still continuing.

<TEXT>
   10. DAVID RODRIGO ORTIZ-HERMIDA and ROBERTO STEINER were pilots
who transported cocaine for the Cartel.
   11. EDUARDO PARDO and DANIEL MIRANDA were pilots who worked for
Cesar Rodriquez and Floyd Carlton-Cacerez and transported money
from the United States to Panama.
   12. HERMAN VELEZ, WILLIAM SALDARRIAGA, JAIME GOMEZ and LUIS
FERNANDO ESCOBAR-OCHOA were Colombian cocaine traffickers.
   Purpose and Objects of the Enterprise
   13. By utilizing his official positions, MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA
and trusted associates were able to assure drug traffickers that
Panamanian military, customs and law enforcement personnel would
not interfere with their operations in Panama as long as
substantial fees were paid to MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA;
   a. Protection of Cocaine Shipments: Members of the Cartel and
other independent narcotics traffickers, with the assistance of
Floyd Carlton-Cacerez, RICARDO BILONICK, Boris Olarte-Morales,
Cesar Rodriquez and others, paid substantial fees to MANUEL ANTONIO
NORIEGA to protect cocaine shipments transported from Colombia
through Panama to the United States. The cocaine was delivered to
secure airstrips in Panama for transshipment.
   b. Protection and Assistance in Manufacturing Cocaine: MANUEL
ANTONIO NORIEGA arranged for the transshipment and sale of ether
and acetone, precursor chemicals used in the manufacture of cocaine
hydrochloride, a Schedule II narcotic controlled substance, to
members of the Cartel including such chemicals previously seized by
Panamanian authorities. Further, MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA agreed to
permit the Cartel to establish and supply a cocaine laboratory in
Darien Province, Panama, and to allow shipments of ether and
acetone to enter Panama from the United States and Europe.
   c. Protection of Narcotics Traffickers: In the spring of 1984,
members of the Cartel and other cocaine traffickers fled Colombia
as a result of increased law enforcement activities in that
country. MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA agreed to permit members of the
Cartel and others to continue their narcotics business within the
borders of Panama and to notify them if and when any law
enforcement action was to be taken against them.
   d. Negotiations and Dispute Settlement: MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA
directly and through intermediaries negotiated with narcotics
traffickers. Failure to make adequate payment to, or the failure to
obtain the prior approval of, MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA for narcotics
operations resulted in the seizure of drugs or other retaliatory
measures by MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA. In 1984, a dispute developed
between members of the Medellin Cartel and MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA
over the seizure of a cocaine laboratory in Darien Province,
Panama, despite payment by members of the Cartel to MANUEL ANTONIO
NORIEGA for protection of the laboratory. This dispute was mediated
by Fidel Castro, Cuban head of State, in meetings with MANUEL
ANTONIO NORIEGA and others in Havana, Cuba.
   e. Protection of Shipments of Narcotics Proceeds From the
Southern District of Florida to Panama: Cesar Rodriquez, Floyd
Carlton-Cacerez and others transported large shipments of United
States currency from the Southern District of Florida to Panama.
MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA assured the safe passage of hundreds of
thousands of dollars of narcotics proceeds into Panamanian banks
and arranged for the drug proceeds to be flown into Panama without
interference by Panamanian customs or law enforcement authorities
at civilian and military airfields.
   The Racketeering Conspiracy
   14. From in or about the fall of 1981 to on or about March 21,
1986, in the Southern District of Florida, and elsewhere, the

but not co-defendants in this count, being members of, employed by
or associated with the Enterpise as more fully described in

commerce in the United States, did unlawfully, willfully and
knowingly combine, conspire, confederate and agree with each other
to conduct and participate, directly and indirectly, in the conduct
of the affairs of the Enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity as defined in Title 18, United States Code, Sections
1961(1) and 1961(5), as described in paragraphs 15 and 16 of this
count, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section

<HEAD>Official: `Cheesehead' Column Backfired on Royko</HEAD>
<DATELINE>APPLETON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mike Royko says people in the Fox Valley
are ``cheeseheads,'' but the region's officials believe the
newspaper columnist has been outfoxed.
   The east-central Wisconsin area is busy trying to lure Chicago
businesses, and local officials say a series of insults by Royko
only helps their cause.
   Greg Hunt, vice president of economic development for the Fox
Cities Chamber of Commerce, said Royko's column introduced millions
of readers to Fox Valley and let them know ``we are among the
safest communities in the nation.'' In its promotional effort, the
region compares itself with Chicago. One postcard shows a chalk
outline on a sidewalk, depicting a Chicago murder victim, compared
with a chalk outline of a hopscotch game in the tranquil Fox Valley
towns.
   The implication brought a stinging attack from Royko in his
column in Wednesday's Chicago Tribune.
   ``Most of the cheeseheads are fine citizens, content to chomp on
a bratwurst, burp, yank on the underside of a cow and wear long red
underwear to formal social events,'' the Pulitzer Prize-winning
columnist wrote. ``There's nothing wrong with long red underwear,
but up there they wear it as an outer garment.''
   Royko wrote that people in Fond du Lac, a community in the Fox
Valley, ``appear so tranquil that their eyes are glazed, their jaws
hang slackly and a few drooled.''
   Fox Valley Marketing Inc., a business development group, sent a
series of postcards to about 500 paper-related buinesses in the
Chicago area. About a dozen businesses have made inquiries.
   The cards maintained that Fox Valley has many advantages over
Chicago: faster-moving traffic, a more productive work force,
cheaper energy, safer streets, better industrial sites and more
affordable housing.
   Royko, a sharp-tongued defender of Chicago, didn't like the
postcards, but he gingerly confessed it was silly to get angry.
   ``Like it or not, crime has a role in our history. Countless
movies and TV drama have been made about Chicago's gangsters.
That's all part of our image. And while we might not be happy with
it, when was the last time you saw a hit movie about a Wisconsin
farmer kissing his cow?'' he asked.

<TEXT>
   Here is a look at Noriega's life in Panama since Dec. 19, based
on news reports and information released by the U.S. Southern
Command from interviews with Noriega associates:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   DEC. 19 _ President Bush orders U.S. troops into combat in
Panama City on a mission to seize Panamanian dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega to face federal drug charges in United States.
Noriega, aware of increased U.S. military activity, goes to Colon,
50 miles north of Panama City, to inspect a new military facility.
Seven hours before the invasion he visits a Panamanian Defense
Forces officers' club on the military side of the international
airport.
   DEC. 20 _ American forces attack and announce within hours they
have smashed Noriega's forces. Noriega flees the club when the
airport is attacked and eludes American troops by driving around
Panama City in circles. He avoids contact with PDF forces, fearing
a trap, and does not take charge of his troops in the fighting. In
a radio broadcast recorded in advance, he tells Panamanians: ``We
are in trench warfare now and we will maintain the resistance. ...
Our slogan is to win or die _ not one step back.''
   DEC. 21 _ Bush says U.S. forces will scour Panama for ``as long
as it takes'' to capture Noriega. An ``agitated'' Noriega spends
several days at different locations but most of the time is at the
home of a relative of Marcella Tason, his personal secretary. While
in hiding he considers but rules out fleeing to the mountains. He
also was believed to have contemplated going to Cuba's embassy, but
backed off because that compound was surrounded by U.S. troops.
   DEC. 24 _ Noriega ends up in the house of the mother of his
mistress, Vicky Amado. Reports say her teen-age daughter called the
information number set up to take tips on finding Noriega and that
the 82nd Airborne Delta Force sent a five-man team to seize him but
missed him by 30 minutes. Noriega contacts the Vatican Embassy and
within a few hours a rendezvous is arranged and a representative of
the Embassy picks Noriega up at a Panama City Dairy Queen and
drives him to the nunciature, according to some reports. Other
reports said Noriega drove to the Vatican after learning of the
surrender of one of his closest commanders, Luis del Cid. The Bush
administration demands he be turned over to face drug charges and
intense negotiations involving the Vatican, U.S. government and new
Panamanian government ensue.
   DEC. 25-JAN. 2 _ Noriega stays in Vatican Embassy with minimal
hospitality, living in a small room on the second floor with no
telephone, a broken TV set and a Bible.
   JAN. 3 _ After being assured he would not face the death penalty
in the United States, Noriega decides to surrender. He asks only
that he be permitted a few phone calls, including one to his wife
in the Cuban Embassy, that he be permitted to wear his uniform, and
that his surrender be kept secret until it was done. He leaves the
Vatican Embassy and surrenders to U.S. authorities.
   JAN. 4 _ Plane carrying Noriega arrives at Homestead Air Force
Base in Florida. At an arraignment in U.S. District Court in Miami,
Noriega maintains he was a political prisoner. A judge enters an
innocent plea on Noriega's behalf after Noriega refuses to enter a
plea to drug-trafficking charges.

   Here are some of the major figures sent here in
recent months to face drug charges:
   _ Luis Arce Gomez, a colonel dubbed ``the minister of cocaine''
while serving as Bolivia's Interior Minister in 1980-81. Arrested
by Bolivian authorities Dec. 10 and turned over to face a 1983
cocaine conspiracy indictment by a Miami grand jury that alleged he
charged traffickers protection money.
   Arraigned on Wednesday. Being held without bond in a federal
prison south of here. A 1983 U.S. effort to extradite him from
Argentina failed when he was released from custody there.
   _ Eduardo Martinez Romero, 36, a reputed financial wizard behind
the Medellin cocaine cartel. Flown to Atlanta on Sept. 6, the first
person extradited from Colombia in its current crackdown.
   Being held in isolation at the federal penitentiary in Atlanta
to face federal charges there he laundered $1.2 billion in drug
money.
   _ Jose Rafael Abello-Silva, 35, flown to Tulsa, Okla., after his
Oct. 29 extradition from Colombia.
   First indicted in 1987. A federal grand jury in Tulsa this week
handed down an amended indictment tying him to cocaine conspiracies
with reputed Colombian cocaine kingpins _ Pablo Escobar-Gaviria,
Jorge Ochoa-Vasquez and the late Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez-Gacha.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David O'Meilia said in Tulsa that Abello
is the ``most significant'' defendant in American custody linked to
the cartel.
   _ Victor Eduardo Mera-Mosquera, 36, a convicted cocaine
smuggler. Turned over to U.S. marshals by Colombian authorities
Dec. 24 and flown to New York.
   Mistakenly released from federal detention in New York and fled
to Colombia before his trial in 1984. Convicted in absentia of drug
conspiracy and distribution, and faces up to 30 years in prison.
   Faces trial on a subsequent charge of co-directing the U.S.
operations of a continuing drug enterprise that smuggled more than
2,200 pounds of cocaine into the United States.
   _ Guillermo Juan Bueno Delgado, 54, a Colombian hotel owner and
investor flown to Tallahassee on Nov. 4. Faces 1985 cocaine
indictments in Florida, California and Illinois alleging
involvement in cocaine conspiracies.
   _ Roberto Peter Carlini-Arrico, 38, taken from Colombia to
Orlando on Oct. 14 to face 1986 federal and state charges of
racketeering and conspiracy alleging he helped smuggle more than a
ton of cocaine into the United States.
   Pleaded guilty Wednesday to federal smuggling count but still
faces the state charges.
   _ Bernardo Pelaez Roldan, taken to Detroit on Oct. 14. Convicted
in absentia there in 1984 on conspiracy to possess cocaine with
intent to distribute.
   _ Ana Rodriguez de Tamayo, 50, a Colombian taken to Miami on
Oct. 14. Co-defendant of Arce Gomez on the 1983 charges. Pleaded
guilty Tuesday to conspiracy to import cocaine.
   _ Luis Del Cid, a former Panama Defense Forces captain described
as Noriega's right-hand man. Surrendered to U.S. forces in Panama
on Dec. 25 and faces charges here in the Noriega indictment.
   Also brought here since the U.S. invasion was a Panamanian
pilot, Daniel Miranda, who is a Noriega co-defendant, and a federal
investigator said another Panamanian co-defendant, Eduardo Pardo,
was arrested Wednesday in Panama.
   In 1987, U.S. authorities were delighted by the extradition of
Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas, taken to the United
States on Feb. 4, 1987, after a shootout at a jungle hideout.
   After a federal trial in Jacksonville, Lehder, 40, was convicted
of conspiracy, cocaine importation, operating a continuing criminal
enterprise and eight counts of possession of cocaine with intent to
distribute.
   Sentenced in 1988 to life in prison without the possibility of
parole, plus 135 years. Being held in the federal prison in Marion,
Ill.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manuel Antonio Noriega was named in
drug-trafficking indictments unsealed Feb. 5, 1988.
   An indictment in Miami alleges that after he took control of
Panama in 1983, Noriega ``utilized his official positions to
provide protection for international criminal narcotics
traffickers,'' including the Medellin cartel.
   The cartel is said to be responsible for 80 percent of the
cocaine reaching the United States.
   Fifteen other people also face charges in the case, and
proceedings have already begun against four of them.
   The indictment charges Noriega with 12 counts of conspiracy,
racketeering, importing drugs and traveling to further the
conspiracy. Specifically, it accuses him of:
   _ Accepting a $4.6 million bribe from Colombia's Medellin cartel
to protect shipments of cocaine, launder money, supply drug
laboratories and shield drug traffickers from the law.
   _ Allowing smugglers to use Panama as a way station for
U.S.-bound cocaine.
   _ Using his official positions before and after he took power in
1983 to provide protection for international narcotics traffickers.
   _ Arranging for the shipment of cocaine processing chemicals,
including those seized by Panamanian police.
   _ Laundering cartel narcotics proceeds in Panamanian banks.
   _ Allowing cartel leaders to shift operations to Panama to
escape a crackdown in Colombia after the assassination of that
country's anti-drug minister of justice.
   _ Traveling to Havana so Cuban President Fidel Castro could
mediate a dispute with the Medellin cartel after Panamanian troops
seized a drug laboratory that Noriega had been paid to protect.
   Noriega could receive up to 145 years in prison and more than
$1.1 million in fines if convicted of all charges.
   A grand jury in Tampa also indicted Noriega on three counts of
marijuana trafficking. The Justice Department has said that Noriega
would be tried in Miami first because the case against him there is
stronger.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a brief look at some legal issues that could be raised
by the defense for Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in proceedings on
drug trafficking charges:
   _ The defense could try to force the government to drop charges
by seeking court disclosure of classified information pertaining to
Noriega's relationship with the CIA.
   _ Pretrial publicity nationwide could make it difficult to
assemble an unbiased jury.
   _ Evidence seized during the military invasion of Panama could
be subject to exclusion if the warrantless search violates
Noriega's Fourth Amendment rights.
   _ The arrest and transportation of Noriega could have violated
U.S. law and provisions of both the Panama Canal Treaty and the
Geneva Convention.
   _ The court could lack jurisdiction because Noriega could be
considered a political prisoner brought to the United States
illegally.
   _ The case could be dismissed if the court finds Noriega is
being selectively prosecuted to force him into concessions on
control of the Panama Canal and the governing of Panama.
   _ Noriega could be immune from prosecution if courts recognized
his stature as de facto head of state of Panama. The judge in the
case has already rejected this argument but it is subject to appeal.

<HEAD>Bush to Propose Cutting Energy-Saving Programs, Sources Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush plans to cut four energy
conservation programs by 85 percent next year, sources say, a
proposal critics say would belie stated administration concerns
about the environment.
   In the fiscal 1991 budget the president unveils Jan. 29, Bush
will propose spending $30 million on the programs, the sources said
Thursday. This compares to $200 million the programs are pegged at
this year.
   Chief among the victims will be the $161 million weatherization
program, under which the government supplies poor families with
insulation, weather stripping and other energy-saving materials.
   Also slashed will be a program that will distribute $25 million
this year to save energy in schools and hospitals; one that will
spend $10 million to help states publicize conservation measures
such as van pooling; and another budgeted at $4 million that
assists states in providing energy-saving counseling to businesses
and individuals.
   Spokesman Roger Meyer of the Department of Energy, which
administers the programs, and spokeswoman Dede Spitznagel of the
Office of Management and Budget, which draws up the budget,
declined to comment.
   But lobbyists who support the programs criticized the proposal.
   ``If this is true, it would be remarkable that a president who's
concerned about energy conservation and global warming would ignore
a program offering serious conservation potential,'' said Meg
Power, lobbyist for the National Community Action Foundation, which
supports programs for poor people.
   The Department of Energy claims that from the weatherization
program's start in 1977 through 1988, it paid for the
weatherproofing of 1.8 million American homes, saving an equivalent
of 4.5 million barrels of oil annually.
   The department says that between 1978 and 1988, the program that
helps conserve energy at schools and hospitals disbursed 22,413
grants worth more than $700 million and saving $1.9 billion in
energy costs.
   Jeffrey Genzer, counsel to the National Association of State
Energy Officials, noted the programs were favorite budget-slashing
targets of former President Reagan. When he presented his first
budget to Congress last year, Bush proposed eliminating federal
spending on them.
   ``What we hoped for was this president would be turning the tide
of the last few years and trying to support energy efficiency,''
Genzer said. ``If these numbers are correct, that wouldn't be
consistent with that view.''
   Bush, who has pledged to make environmental concerns a priority
of his presidency, signed a proclamation Wednesday designating
April 22 as the 20th annual Earth Day.
   He said the day ``should inspire us to save the land we love, to
realize that global problems do have local solutions, and to make
preservation of the planet a personal commitment.''
   For the 1991 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, the Gramm-Rudman
deficit reduction law requires that the president submit a budget
with a shortfall of no more than $64 billion. Budget experts
believe this means Bush must find about $40 billion in savings in
his $1.2 trillion budget.
   The two sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified,
said they were not certain how the $30 million would be spent among
the four programs. But one said it was likely the money would be
distributed in the same proportions by which it is now spent.
   Sources said previously that Bush also will propose cutting from
$1.4 billion to $1.05 billion another program that subsidizes the
home heating bills of about 6.1 million low-income American
households.

<TEXT>
   Two days before he was ousted, Nicolae
Ceausescu, the ``best son of Romania,'' held the limelight in the
state-run press. The newspapers Dec. 20 published 12 photographs of
him on a state visit to Iran.
   Three days after the dictator and his wife, Elena, were executed
on Christmas Day, the daily newspaper Truth published its first
anti-Ceausescu cartoon, a ``Report From Hell,'' which showed the
former first couple in a boiling cauldron.
   ``We protest!'' shrieks Elena. ``We want to boil only in a
golden cauldron!''
   The press has been using its new freedom with a vengeance,
informing Romanians each day of more excesses committed by the
reviled Ceausescus.
   On Dec. 26, Truth began serializing excerpts from ``Red
Horizons,'' the memoirs of former counterintelligence chief Ion
Pacepa, who defected to the United States in 1978.
   In his book, published in the West two years ago, Pacepa
chronicled how Ceausescu and other Romanians tried to steal Western
technological secrets and recruit Jimmy Carter's brother as an
``agent d'influence,'' or spied on Romanians abroad and at home,
sending and executing death threats.
   Elena Ceausescu was portrayed as a domineering, crude woman who
relished listening to tapes secretly made each week at her
children's apartments and the homes of top officials.
   ``What can be read in the pages of this book appears to be the
fruit of a sick fantasy and yet, every word is true,'' Truth said
as it introduced the Pacepa excerpts to Romanians.
   ``The publication of this book played an uncontested role in
revealing in all its hideousness the true face of a dictatorship
which with diabolical cunningness had managed at the outset to
outfox a part of the world,'' the newspaper said.
   The United States and other Western powers originally cultivated
Ceausescu for his relatively independent foreign policy within the
Warsaw Pact, moving away only when Ceausescu's rule grew harsher
and other Pact countries began to reform in the mid-1980s.
   The personality cult Ceausescu built during his 24-year rule
took on the trappings of worship and pervaded practically all
aspects of public life. His portrait lined the streets in Bucharest
and other Romanian cities.
   Now, the leader formerly called the ``genius of the
Carpathians,'' the ``hero among heroes'' and the ``founder of a new
country'' is called ``Romania's No. 1 terrorist,'' a ``paranoid''
and a ``Doberman,'' an allusion to pets he reportedly fed with
imported meat.
   His portraits and books have been burned by angry Romanians who
suffered widespread food and energy shortages and were spied upon
by the Securitate, Ceausescu's secret police.
   ``He called himself with the most abject impudence `the most
beloved and esteemed,' but he talked like the illiterate peasants
from the beginning of this century,'' Ion Marin wrote in Truth in
an editorial titled ``Vipers.''
   Mrs. Ceausescu, the second-most powerful person in the country,
``added to her name the title of scientist of `world repute,' but
she omitted to say that she could not write and she could hardly
read at all,'' Marin said.
   Elena, whose official title was ``Academician Dr. Eng. Elena
Ceausescu,'' was trained as a chemist, but officials said privately
even while she was in power that her title was merely political.
   Truth on Thursday published Elena's school records and marks,
showing that she dropped out of school, like Ceausescu, after the
fourth grade.
   In other recent articles and editorials, Romania's avid readers
learned that:
   _ Thousands of women died seeking abortions over the past few
years due to woefully inadequate medical conditions linked to
Ceausescu's near-ban on abortions.
   Ceausescu decreed the virtual abortion ban to encourage
procreation. Roamania's new interim government swiftly lifted the
law.
   _ Mrs. Ceausescu had deposited in savings the equivalent of
$130,000 at the official rate of exchange for her daughter and each
of her two sons.
   _ She canceled Romania's subscriptions to international news
agencies to save $75,000 annually and stopped delivery of all
foreign newspapers to keep Romanians isolated, according to the
official news agency Rompres.
   _ Ceausescu's obsession with being photographed cost the country
$28 million. All the pictures were heavily retouched so he would
look younger.
   As soon as Ceausescu was overthrown Dec. 22, Agerpres abolished
censorship and pledged to inform subscribers in Romania and abroad
``in an honest and civilized way.''
   On Jan. 2, the facelift was completed with a name change.
Agerpres, an acronym for Agentia Romana de Presa _ Romanian Press
Agency _ now is Rompres.
   Aside from the desire to break with Ceausescu's era, the name
change may have been prompted by a desire to get rid of unkind
jokes. ``Ager'' in Romanian means quick, or quick-witted _ a
description that always gave Romanian and foreign journalists a
laugh when applied to Ceausescu's docile news agency.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Noriega's Gone, Now Comes the Hard Part</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manuel Antonio Noriega is in U.S. hands and
President Bush is claiming total victory for his Panama gamble. Now
comes the hard part.
   Ahead lies the unglamorous task of helping Panama, staggered by
sanctions and Stealth fighter bombs, restore its once-vibrant
economy.
   Panama has been in a steep economic decline for more than two
years, partly the result of the punitive sanctions imposed by the
United States in its campaign to oust Noriega.
   Beyond that is the cost of the U.S. invasion of Panama which,
according to some estimates, dealt a $2 billion blow to the
economy. Entire neighborhoods were leveled and scores of businesses
were wiped out because of looting.
   The Reagan administration had systematically dismantled a host
of programs designed to increase Panama's exports and to attract
U.S. investment. Partly as a result, Panama's per capita income has
dropped from $2,000 a year to between $1,600 and $1,700.
   Reversing the decline won't be easy. Panama is burdened by a
foreign debt listed at $543 million. Fresh money from the United
States, aside from emergency relief, is not in the offing because
just about all the foreign aid money is already earmarked by
Congress. The administration doesn't have the authority to help
Panama by taking funds from another aid recipient.
   The United States can restore the trade and investment benefits
but the impact is not expected to be felt for some time. At least
Panama's new government can count on the $370 million in assets
which were frozen by the U.S. government last year and which now
are being unfrozen. Also, the capital flight that took place under
Noriega has been reversed since the invasion.
   For a time, Bush will be able to bask in victory. Americans in
Panama, who walked the country's streets in fear just weeks ago,
are now being regaled as heroes, particularly the troops who helped
force Noriega into humiliating exile.
   The international protests over the U.S. invasion, reflected in
votes cast at the United Nations and the Organization of American
States, have been displaced somewhat by the outpouring of popular
support shown for the U.S. action by the Panamanian people.
   In a country accustomed to military domination, rarely have the
prospects for civilian rule been brighter. U.S. officials have
reason to hope that the United States will be able to turn over the
Panama Canal to a stable, democratic government at the end of the
century when U.S. control over the waterway ends, according to
treaty obligations.
   Still, the pitfalls are many. For one thing, Panama's democratic
roots are shallow. The last time Panama had an unambiguously fair
election was 1968. The winner was dumped by the military after 11
days in office.
   The expectations of the Panamanian people are running
dangerously high, and the country's embrace of the United States
could turn to wrath if, over time, the aspirations for a better
life are unfulfilled.
   The United States is insisting that Panama needs a strong
defense force to replace the one _ now decimated _ that Noriega
led. U.S. officials reason that a weak military would not be able
to defend the canal adequately, but some Panamanians are worried
that a powerful successor defense establishment would, like the one
run by Noriega, dominate the country's political life.
   Perhaps inevitably, the invasion produced tragic loss of
innocent lives; an estimated 300 Panamanian civilians are believed
dead. And the heat of battle produced some decisions that came
under widespread criticism.
   There was the controversy over the communications techniques of
the U.S. military _ the playing of boom-box music through stereo
speakers in a bid to thwart suspected eavesdroppers and perhaps to
drive Noriega out of his Vatican Embassy sanctuary.
   Under Vatican pressure, the soldiers threw in the towel and
agreed to silence the din after a few days. Wednesday night it was
Noriega who threw in the towel. For all its problems, Panama's
prospects seem better than his.

   The weight of office off his shoulders, Ed Koch
now simply wants to take off weight.
   Just four days out of City Hall, the porky former mayor
presented himself Thursday as the new pitchman for a weight-loss
powder, unabashedly touting its reputed benefits and his own
overstuffed profile.
   ``I know I'm fat,'' he said. ``I can tell you how I know I'm
fat. I see myself in the mirror, naked. Horrible.''
   Koch's fatness is not news to New Yorkers, whom the mayor
entertained with a series of celebrated and unsuccessful diets
during his 12 years in power. Standing 6-foot-1, he gained 44
pounds in office, to 244 now.
   Cash is the new ingredient in his effort to drop 30 or 40
pounds. Free from the strictures of government ethics, Koch, 65,
has agreed to have his Ultra Slim-Fast weight-loss program
documented in television and print ads.
   ``Obviously I'm promoting this and I will be paid, there's no
question about that,'' he told reporters. ``There's nothing wrong
with that. We live in a capitalist society.''

   Billy Joel says he feels like part of his family
has been taken when others claim ownership of his songs.
   Joel told Rolling Stone magazine in the Jan. 9 issue that he's
``not all that rich'' and may, in fact, owe money.
   The 40-year-old singer is touring and has just released ``Storm
Front,'' his most successful album in a decade, but he said
copyright disputes over some of his past songs have made his
financial status questionable.
   ``For better or worse, your songs are your kids. Then somebody
comes along and tells you that they're not your kids anymore. The
bank is going to take your kid,'' he said.
   He said part of the problem is that artists are ``knuckleheads
when it comes to business. Money isn't why I did what I've done
with my life. I did what I did because it made me happy. But I'm
tired of getting it taken away from me by other people who haven't
earned it.''
   Meanwhile, he says people too often misunderstand his
relationship with his wife, supermodel Christie Brinkley, ``as if
somehow Christie and I don't love and hurt and feel the same things
that anybody else does.''
   ``What do they think we do _ walk in the door and fly around on
gossamer and glitzy gliders? Don't people realize that the minute
the door closes, all of the silly rock star-supermodel stuff goes
right out the window? Then it's just me and her and real
man-and-wife time,'' Joel said.

   Gabonese President Omar Bongo,
offering cash and an assortment of traditional gifts, married the
daughter of the president of the neighboring Congo.
   State radio said the marriage of Bongo and Edith Sassou Nguesso,
a 27-year-old doctor, took place in a family ceremony in Oyo, the
home village of President Denis Sassou Nguesso about 250 miles
north of Brazzaville.
   Bongo, 54, who has three children from a previous marriage,
offered about $170 to the families of his new wife's father and
mother, along with two pieces of fabric, a headscarf, a men's suit,
a pair of women's shoes, a shovel and a hoe.
   In August, when rumors of the marriage began to circulate, Bongo
refused to confirm or deny them. ``People should stop concerning
themselves with something that's none of their business,'' said
Bongo, who has been president of Gabon, a country of 1.5 million on
Africa's West Coast, since 1967.

<HEAD>Noriega Can Get a Fair Trial, Experts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some questions and answers on the
legal situation surrounding former Panamanian dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega, who surrendered to U.S. authorities and now faces
trial on drug-smuggling charges.
   The answers were distilled from interviews with experts,
including two professors specializing in international law and the
American legal system, and a lawyer in international practice.
   Q. Can Noriega get a fair trial?
   A. The courts will say he can. What's the alternative? Are we
supposed to say that someone's notoriety prevents him from ever
being brought to justice? The question is not whether people have
reached any conclusions or have any impressions in the case, but
whether they can put aside their impressions or opinions to judge
guilt or innocence.
   Q. President Bush has called Norega a thug; other officials have
had equally harsh assessments. Can a jury be found that is not
affected by these characterizations?
   A. The emotions will quiet down by the time the case comes to
trial, which may be a year or a year and a half or more. People
will forget. The judge in the Oliver North trial was able to seat a
jury that claimed to not have seen, heard or read about North's
televised testimony in Congress.
   Q. Will the manner of bringing him to this country cause
problems?
   A. This is a matter of controversy. One expert said whatever
international law problems are raised, once the government has
custody of someone it doesn't matter how it obtained custody, so
long as he gets due process from now on.
   Q. What are the biggest problems in bringing Noriega to trial?
   A. Another expert questioned the legality of Noriega's
apprehension. Under federal law, there will be the issue of whether
or not Noriega's property was reasonably seized and searched. Under
international law the problem will be whether the terms of the 1904
extradition treaty between the United States and Panama were
properly adhered to and whether the Panama constitution itself was
violated. Other problems under international law go to the issue of
whether the U.S. armed forces have the right to apprehend a
fugitive from American justice in another country without the
express consent of the foreign government. Without detailed
information, lawyers presume the Endara government consented.
   Q. If you were his defense lawyer, what would be your tactic?
   A. You would want to attack the credibility of government
witnesses as hard as possible. Based on what we know, all or many
of them appear to be drug dealers or people with long criminal
records. You want to pound away as much as possible on the idea
that you can't convict anyone on testimony from such shaky and
shabby people.
   Q. Will the military activities that brought about Noriega's
surrender be a continuing factor?
   A. This is an area that is a mine field, where the United States
is really flirting with serious violations of international law and
risking being branded an international lawbreaker and exposing
Americans in the future to be targets of kidnappings. But he
volunteered to come out of the Vatican Embassy and surrender
himself to Drug Enforcement Administration agents and put himself
voluntarily into the hands of the American law enforcement and
criminal justice system.
   Q. What are the biggest issues facing prosecutors?
   A. The indictment is a year old and reflects events that
happened a long time ago. There may be some problems with evidence
and with witnesses. Another possible major roadblock will be
maneuvering by Noriega's lawyers to subpoena documents, government
officials including possibly even the president of the United
States.
   Q. Won't the way evidence was obtained in Panama, breaking into
Noriega's residence, be a problem for prosecutors?
   A. The U.S. attorney in Florida claims he has enough evidence in
Florida to successfully prosecute Noriega and does not need the
documentary evidence seized in Panama. He presumably would not have
brought the indictments in the first place unless he had already
compiled sufficient evidence.
   Q. What happens to Noriega if he is acquitted?
   A. The issue will be raised, shall he be extradited to Panama or
deported as an undesirable alien, in which case he would have to
find a country that will take him _ possibly Cuba or Nicaragua. He
could also face charges in Panama regardless of whether he is
convicted in the United States.

<HEAD>Historian Warns That East-West Euphoria Has Evaporated Before</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new peace group formed in the euphoria over
democratic movements in Eastern Europe is being warned by an
old-timer in its ranks that upheaval in the communist bloc does not
mean the cold war is over.
   ``There will be very, very tough times ahead for a peace
movement and for all Americans,'' said James McGregor Burns, the
historian who won the Pulitzer Prize nearly two decades ago for a
biography of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
   ``The cold war, in my view, is not over,'' Burns, a fellow of
the Humanities Center of Williams College, said at a news
conference Thursday announcing formation of the Committee on Common
Security.
   ``There is a residue in the Soviet Union of bitter feeling
against this country and there is a residue in this country of
people who feel equally bitterly toward the Soviet Union,'' the
71-year-old historian cautioned.
   ``I lived through a period, namely World War II, when we were
equally euphoric about the future of Soviet-American
relationships,'' Burns said. ``Within one year of the ending of
World War II, that partnership was dissolved.''
   ``Once there are setbacks, and there will be many setbacks,
there will be recrimination, there will be defeatism, there will be
a falling away from the peace movement, people will give up the
fight,'' he said.
   Burns told reporters, however, that the new committee ``plans to
persist, and will be there during the bleak times ... as well as
the very euphoric moments.''
   A principal objective of the committee, a project of the
Institute for Peace and International Security of Cambridge, Mass.,
will be directing spending from military to civilian purposes.
   In contrast to Burns' view, George Rathjens, a professor of
political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who
wrote the first study paper issued by the new committee, said, ``I
start with the thesis that the cold war really is over.''
   The Rathjens paper calls for establishment of a joint panel by
the House and Senate committees on armed services and foreign
affairs to study U.S. military commitments. It says Congress should
``begin at zero and build upward within the context of findings
made by the special joint committee.''
   Rathjens argued that the United States should scrap attempts to
improve delivery of nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union, ``put
them on ice and get rid of a lot of those weapons, put them in
mothballs if you like.''
   ``We can reject all efforts at strategic modernization at this
time,'' he said. ``None of that is required.''
   Rathjens said the international situation also justifies
``withdrawal of substantial numbers'' of troops from Europe.
   Marion Anderson, director of Employment Research Associates of
Lansing, Mich., said her group, which studies defense spending,
estimates the budget cuts suggested by Defense Secretary at $17
billion a year and ``we think the military budget can go down a
great deal more.''
   ``Just for starters, about $170 billion a year is being spent on
NATO,'' she said. ``Why shouldn't that be pulled down by about 75
per cent. We're talking about real, real big money like cuts of
around $100 billion.''
   Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employesl said the union will mobilize
its lobbyists ``to provide some education, to provide some
political heat, to provide some political clout to the members of
Congress.''
   Feminist author Betty Friedan predicted, ``There will be in the
next months and within the year, an eruption of this political
movement in this country, just as underneath the surface of
stagnant communism, nobody could have predicted the formation'' of
democratic movements in Eastern European countries.
   Paul F. Walker, co-director of the Institute for Peace and
International Security, said the group plans to hold seminars
around the country.

<TEXT>
   When U.S. troops stormed the home of
a Panamanian military officer during last month's invasion, they
found only his 3{-month-old son and a babysitter.
   ``In the end we were his captives,'' Lt. Col. Douglass Colbert,
a chaplain, said Thursday of little Eloy Alberto Diaz.
   Eloy was sleeping at his home in the residential section of Fort
Amador, a military installation shared by Panamanian and U.S.
military forces, when U.S. Army soldiers broke in a few minutes
after the invasion began early in the morning of Dec. 20.
   About 300 yards away Army units were fighting with a Panamanian
military police company and American tanks had opened up on the
nearby Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters.
   Eloy's father, Capt. Ramon Diaz, was commander of a special
Panamanian anti-terrorist unit at Fort Amador as well as head of a
detachment`in Veraguas, 150 miles west of Panama City. He
surrendered.
   The boy's mother, Jeanette Vazquez de Diaz _ Miss Panama 1985 _
was at her mother's house at the time of the invasion.
   Colbert said that the morning after the assault, ``I saw this
American soldier in full battle gear walking down the street with a
baby bottle sterilizer under his arm. Behind him was this young
woman with a baby.
   ``Later on, the soldiers came by the house with the baby and
told me they did not know what to do with the baby. I told him we
would take care of him. They brought him to the house,'' said
Colbert, whose home is also in Fort Amador.
   Mrs. Diaz said she could not immediately get near the Amador
area.
   ``It was two days later that someone called me to tell me that
my baby was at the chaplain's home. I had been going crazy,'' she
said.
   After two more days of worrying while she waited in refugee
centers, Mrs. Diaz managed to contact Colbert and shortly afterward
a military jeep took her to the chaplain's home.
   ``It was a very teary meeting, as you can imagine,'' Colbert
said. ``Everybody cried.''
   Mother and baby spent Christmas in the Colbert house.
   ``The neighbors found out`about the baby and they brought gifts
for him,'' Colbert said. ``He and his mother are now members of our
family.''
   Colbert said Capt. Diaz remains a prisoner at Fort Clayton,
another U.S. military installation.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bacteria that are harmless to humans but
deadly to salmonella are being tested as a way for food processors
and packagers to eliminate a common cause of food-poisoning, the
Agriculture Department says.
   ``It will take at least a year to grow the bacteria and test
their performance as a natural control mechanism,'' said Richard
Whiting, a research food technologist with the department's
Agricultural Research Service.
   But he said this is the first time anyone has tried to use a
predatory bacterium to ensure food safety.
   The bacteria are named B. bacteriovorous, B. starrii and B.
stolpii. All are rod-shaped bacteria known as Bdellovibrio.
   They are common in soil and water and often swallowed by humans
swimming in rivers, lakes or the ocean.
   Whiting said that under a microscope the predatory bacteria
squeeze through the cell wall of salmonella and begin feeding,
causing the salmonella to die in about 30 minutes.
   Studies will determine whether they can be commercially adapted
as a spray to stop salmonella and other bacterial growth in meats,
eggs and powdered milk during processing, said Whiting.
   They might also be added to packaged meats sold at grocery
stores, he suggested.
   ``We're interested in how broad the Bdellovibrio's appetites
are,'' said Whiting.
   But even if adapted for commercial use, Bdellovibrio should not
be considered a replacement for current salmonella preventions such
as good refrigeration and thoroughly cooking meat.
   ``I look at this as a form of insurance,'' he said of the
discovery.
   The Agriculture Department estimates that illnesses caused by
salmonella and other food-borne bacteria have a $1 billion to $10
billion economic impact through lost wages, decreased worker
productivity, medical expenses, industry production losses and
destruction of products.

   An Agriculture Department scientist says he
has`found hundreds of varieties of rice that repel weeds without
the use of chemicals, says the department.
   ``Utilizing this natural defense could lead to a savings in
herbicides and reduce the amount of chemicals a farmer uses,'' said
Robert Dilday of USDA's Agricultural Research Service.
   He has identified 191 rice varieties with some ability to
naturally repel the weed known as ducksalad, 132 varieties that
fend off redstem, and 15 varieties that are resistant to both.
   He also found six types of rice that resist broadleaf
signalgrass, a weed that competes for nutrients and sunlight.
   Dilday works at the research service's Rice Production and Weed
Control Research Laboratory in Stuttgart, Ark.
   He said field tests have shown that weeds on average would not
grow within five inches of the resistant rice plants.

   A major soybean organization is pushing for a
change in federal policy it says will make American farmers more
competitive on the world soybean market.
   ``World markets are growing 3 percent to 5 percent yearly, but
the United States is losing both soybean income, export volume and
market share,'' Marlyn Jorgensen, president of the American Soybean
Association, said Thursday.
   The United States is still the single largest producer of
soybeans, but its lead is slipping. Foreign growers as a group now
produce more than half the world crop, said Jorgensen's
organization in a statement.
   ``If current trends continue, South America alone will
outproduce and outsell the United States by the year 2000,'' said
the ASA.
   Jorgensen blamed federal government soybean policies and
suggested a change he said should be made part of the 1990 farm
bill.
   He said his organization did not yet have a congressional
sponsor for its proposal, but has been talking to Rep. Dan
Glickman, D-Kan., chairman of the House Agriculture soybean
subcommittee.
   An aide to Glickman said the proposal is ``one of several
options'' being considered for the 1990 farm bill, but that it is
too early to say whether it or any other will be adopted.
   The plan calls for
   _a voluntary loan program with rates set by a formula based on
cotton and corn target prices, acreage reduction programs and
traditional price ratios of soybeans and corn and cotton.
   _an equity payment equal to the difference between the adjusted
county soybean loan rate and the posted county price for soybeans.
   _a graduated income support based on the level of soybean stocks.
   _the selling of crops rather than forfeiting them to the
governmentn
   Jorgensen said that under the plan, farmers would make planting
decisions based on market prices, not government support programs,
but would also have government back-up if prices are too low.
   He said it also would prevent government stockpiling by
encouraging farmers to go to market with their soybeans rather than
forfeiting them to the government for benefits.

<HEAD>Legal Experts Doubt Noriega Can Claim `Head of State' Immunity</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Noriega, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Manuel Antonio Noriega's status as a deposed head of state
probably won't do him any good in U.S. courts, legal specialists
say.
   Although international lawyers disagree about whether Noriega
could be prosecuted for his official acts, most say he can't claim
immunity for common crimes _ such as drug-running _ that weren't
part of his official duties.
   ``It's going to be hard for Noriega to say, `If it is true that
I was trafficking drugs ... I did that pursuant to my
responsibilities as head of state,''' said Bruce Zagaris, a
Washington lawyer who co-chairs the American Bar Association's
committee on international criminal law.
   Noriega's lawyers have suggested that he should be entitled to
immunity because of his office. Earlier this week, one of his
former attorneys, Neal Sonnett, said Noriega ``is entitled to `head
of state immunity.'''
   But early last year, after Noriega was indicted, U.S. District
Judge William Hoeveler ruled that the Panamanian leader had no
grounds for such a claim because the State Department had never
recognized his political legitimacy.
   And even if Noriega were considered a legitimate head of state,
experts say he probably couldn't claim ``head of state immunity.''
   ``First of all, it's not clear that there is such a thing,''
Columbia Law School professor Lori Fisler Damrosch said,
``although, as you might expect, several recently deposed heads of
state did make such an argument.''
   One was deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, whose
case may offer the closest parallels to Noriega's.
   After he sought exile in Hawaii, Marcos claimed that the ``act
of state doctrine'' gave him immunity to both civil lawsuits and
criminal prosecution in the United States. The courts ruled against
him.
   ``The doctrine,'' the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said,
``is meant to facilitate the foreign relations of the United
States, not to furnish the equivalent of sovereign immunity to a
deposed leader.''
   In other words, a deposed ruler might be granted immunity _ but
only if the U.S. government considers it advantageous. In Noriega's
case, as Ms. Damrosch said, ``the views of President Bush and the
executive branch are quite clear.''
   The Marcos case differs somewhat from Noriega's because Marcos
was living in the United States when he was indicted and his
alleged crimes were more closely related to his official duties.
   Legal experts were hard pressed to recall another case of a
foreign leader being prosecuted outside his country.
   Most cited the war crimes trials after World War`II in which
high German officials and Japan's prime minister, Hideki Tojo, were
tried and convicted. But they stressed that such trials were
extraordinary and provide no precedent for ordinary criminal
prosecutions.
   One scholar, Alfred Rubin, a professor of international law at
the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, said
the Noriega case reminds him of British prosecutions of Malay
sultans in Southeast Asia in the 19th century.
   In the first such case, he said, a claimant to a sultan's throne
was charged with piracy in 1840 after he intercepted British
shipping in an effort to seize control of a Malay state. A jury
ruled that the act was political, not criminal, and acquitted him.
   ``And so the British, sulking and mad, exiled him to the
Seychelles,'' said Rubin, a strong critic of the Noriega
prosecution. ``British history is full of all sorts of attempts at
imperial domination, and we're just going through all their
mistakes now.''
   But even Rubin offers little comfort to Noriega when it comes to
the ``head of state'' defense. ``As far as I know, there is no such
doctrine,'' he said. ``I think it's been made up by the defense
attorneys.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev Postpones Meetings to Concentrate on Soviet Unrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was reported
Thursday night to have postponed all contacts with foreign leaders
to concentrate on growing unrest in the Soviet Union.
   A spokesman for Britain's opposition Labor Party said the Soviet
Ambassador in London, Leonid Zamyatin, had told party leader Neil
Kinnock that Gorbachev was postponing all such meetings for the
rest of the month.
   The news sent the Tokyo stock exchange tumbling 500 points, or
about 1.5 percent, off the Nikkei average in early trading Friday.
   The Labor Party spokesman said Zamyatin delivered a personal
message from Gorbachev to Kinnock, who had been scheduled to meet
with the Soviet leader in Moscow for talks on Jan. 16.
   The message said the meeting had to be postponed because
``political events in the Soviet Union'' required Gorbachev's
``personal attention and participation,'' said the Labor spokesman,
who in accordance with British practice declined to be identified.
   The latest unrest in the Soviet Union has involved Azerbaijani
demonstrators on the Soviet-Iranian border trying to force open the
frontier and reunite with their brethren in Iran.
   The KGB sent border troop reinforcements to the area Wednesday
to stop protesters from smashing guard towers and security alarms.
   Also, Lithuanian Communist leaders met with Gorbachev on
Thursday and said later that the Kremlin leader failed to sway them
from their decision to split from the Soviet Communist Party and
pursue local independence.
   Gorbachev has vigorously opposed the Lithuanians' decision, but
the No. 2 party official in the Baltic republic said the president
promised Thursday not to interfere.

<HEAD>Pentagon Sends `Nation-Building Forces' to Help Repair Panama</HEAD>

   With the principle goal of Operation Just
Cause met _ the capture of Manuel Antonio Noriega _ the U.S. focus
is on repairing Panama's basic services and utilities destroyed or
disrupted in the invasion.
   Call the troops landing in Panama ``nation-building forces,''
the Pentagon says.
   ``Civil affairs personnel ... people who provide police service
and assistance to utilities and that kind of thing,'' Pentagon
spokesman Pete Williams told reporters Thursday in describing the
specialists sent to Panama.
   The number of U.S. servicemen in Panama stands at about 25,500,
the same as it was shortly after the invasion, as combat troops are
withdrawn and replaced by military police and civil affairs
specialists, Williams said.
   ``So what you have is a change _ even though in some cases the
numbers may stay roughly the same, you have a change in the
complexion of the force,'' Williams said.
   Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
arrived in Panama on Thursday to meet with Gen. Maxwell Thurman of
the U.S. Southern Command and work out a timetable for withdrawal
of the troops.
   Prior to the invasion on Dec. 20, about 12,000 U.S. troops were
stationed in Panama to guard the canal under the terms of a treaty
under`which the United States is to turn the waterway over to
Panama in the year 1999.
   The civil affairs specialists include active and reserve,
officers and enlisted men, bankers and garbage collectors. To date,
about 140 reserves from around the country and about 110
active-duty specialists from the 96th Battalion at Fort Bragg,
N.C., have been sent to Panama. About 25 of them arrived during the
first 48 hours after the invasion.
   Their purpose, according to the Pentagon, is to help the
Panamanians repair and restore basic public services such as
telephone, water and electricity. A group of combat engineers is
expected later with bulldozers to destroy what is left of the
Commandancia, the headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces,
said Pentagon spokesman Col. Miguel E. Monteverde.
   The specialists are similar to those who were sent to Japan and
Germany following World War II.
   ``They are experts in government and municipal services,''
Monteverde said.
   During the briefing, Williams said fighting had all but ceased
in Panama.
   In other developments, the Pentagon spokesman said one of
Noriega's bodyguards overheard U.S. servicemen discussing the
invasion hours before it occurred, but it was unclear whether the
incident enabled the ousted Panamanian leader to evade the
Americans.
   ``There is some evidence that some officials may have had some
advance thought that this operation was about to happen. But there
isn't a lot`of evidence that actions were taken as a result of
that,'' Williams said.
   ``A bodyguard, during a debriefing interviewl said that two U.S.
soldiers had been overheard discussing their positions for H-hour.
And that supposedly happened at 10 p.m., three hours before the
attack was to begin,'' said Williams. ``I have no other details.''
   Noriega is believed to have escaped from one of his residences
minutes`before a U.S. commando unit arrived just after midnight
Dec. 20, and fled from house to house in Panama City in the days
thereafter, according to military officials. Noriega found refuge
in the Vatican Embassy on Dec. 24 and turned himself over to U.S.
officials Wednesday.

very-low-calorie programs that are used by more than a million
Americans, doctors warned today.
   Such liquid diets require management by a specially trained
physician, and by a behavioral psychologist and dietician, the
doctors wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Although the diets are ``unquestionably safer'' than their
liquid-protein predecessors, which were blamed for at least 58
deaths during the 1970s, they still have dangers, said the
article's authors.
   ``The recent and zealous marketing of various formula products
to physicians, as well as the public's appetite for such diets,
could lead to yet another round of complications and fatalities,''
wrote the doctors, who are from the University of Pennsylvania,
Columbia University and Harvard Medical School.
   Very-low-calorie diets provide 400 to 800 calories daily through
a high-protein powder. The dieter adds water or milk and drinks the
liquid three to five times daily instead of eating food. After 12
to 16 weeks on the regimen, the dieter gradually resumes eating
normal food.
   Such diets, like the Optifast program used by talk show host
Oprah Winfrey in her celebrated 67-pound weight loss, should be
avoided by people who need to lose less than 40 pounds or 30
percent of their body weight, said the authors, two of whom are
consultants for the maker of Optifast.
   People with certain heart problems also shouldn't go on the
diets, they said.
   Short-term health problems from the diets can include
dehydration; an imbalance of electrolytes, the chemicals that carry
electrical impulses sparking the heart to pump; inadequate blood
pressure after standing or sitting up rapidly, which can cause
fainting; and increased uric acid concentrations, which promote
gout, the authors said.
   Long-term complications could include severe abnormalities in
heartbeat _ the culprit in the liquid-protein-diet deaths _
especially by dieters who lose control and go on eating sprees
during ``refeeding,'' the authors said.
   Such problems can be headed off early or prevented entirely with
proper supervision, the authors said.
   In November, Ms. Winfrey announced on her show that she had
regained 17 of the 67 pounds she lost a year earlier.
   But ``she has maintained 75 percent of her weight loss, which we
consider to be consistent with an average patient going through the
program,'' said Jim Parsons, a spokesman for Sandoznutrition Corp.,
which markets`the Optifast program.
   Intensive supervision is a requirement of the program, Parsons
said Thursday in a telephone interview from Minneapolis.
   Optifast, which costs about $3,000 and requires at least a
year's commitment by the patient, has been available since the
mid-1970s and has been used by more than 600,000 patients, Parsons
said.
   It contrasts sharply with products marketed directly to private
physicians, with the promise of greatly increasing their`income,
said Thomas A. Wadden, associate professor of psychiatry at the
University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and co-author of the
journal article.
   Wadden said as many as 12,000 doctors are now providing
very-low-calorie diets as part of their outpatient practice.
   ``The problem is that`these persons are going to help their
patients lose weight, but the patients are destined to regain the
weight, because they have not learned to modify their eating,
exercise and dietary habits,'' Wadden said.
   Liquid-protein diets of the 1970s used a poor-quality protein,
while the newer diets use high-quality protein, plus vitamins and
other nutrients, said Wadden.
   Similar programs have come under fire before. One program,
Medifast, was called the ``Outrage of the Month'' in July by Public
Citizen Health Research Groupn
   The Washington-based consumer watchdog group blasted Medifast's
marketing company, Jason Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Timonium, Md., and
its subsidiary`Research Institute of Maryland for telling
physicians that enrolling 15 new patients a month could increase
their profits by $62,000 annually.
   Patricia Kail, a spokeswoman for Medifast, said that ``was blown
way out of proportion _ we don't go and say the physician can make
`x' amount of dollars.'' She said the program has been used byM
400,000 patients during the past 10 years without any reports of
deaths or serious complications.

   Most demonstrators outside Miami's federal
courthouse cheered the United States for bringing Manuel Antonio
Noriega to Florida, and those offering contrary`opinions were
targets of angry shouting.
   As the fallen Panamanian dictator awaited his arraignment
Thursday on a 1988 drug indictment, about 40 policemen and U.S.
marshals watched over two groups of about 50 Panamanian exiles
demonstrating outside and more than 100 journalists.
   ``No one will go until this thing is fixed,'' said Carlos
Villarino, a spokesman for the Panamanian Refugee Center in Miami.
   He said he wanted Noriega to spend all of his possible sentence
in a maximum-security jail, adding: ``I want him to have to ask
permission to breathe. I want his dignity destroyed like he tried
to destroy ours.''
   A shouting match began when a group of about five exiles said
the U.S. invasion violated Panama's sovereignty. The group called
for newly installed President Guillermo Endara to hold free
elections.
   ``We regret that (Noriega) was taken to the U.S. to face justice
here,'' said Silvio Cordoba Quinonez. ``What happened to Panamanian
justice? Are we nobody? Endara has to preserve our sovereignty.''
   Jose Cepero, a Cuban-American who held a sign saying ``U.S.
Hands`Off Panama,'' was surrounded by a mob of Panamanian exiles
who tore the sign and shouted insults.
   ``Panama is a free country. The Panamanians should decide what
should happen to Noriega,'' Cepero said as police escorted him to
safety.
   Federal marshals secured the 10-story courthouse, using two-way
radios, metal detectors, binoculars and weapons. Officers were
stationed throughout the building, at all doors and in the streets
outside while Noriega occupied a basement cell before his
arraignment.
   ``Obviously they've increased security,'' said a receptionist
for Daniel Horgan, chief U.S. marshal in Miami. ``But he won't make
any comment.'' The receptionist refused to give her name.
   About 20 marshals _ about double the usual number _ guarded
barricades at the prisoner entrance to the courthouse, and
pedestrians were forced to walk on the other side of the street.
   Plainclothes marshals equipped with binoculars scanned the
surrounding neighborhood from the roof throughout the day, instead
of the normal twice-daily practice when prisoners are being moved
in and out of the building.
   Hours before Noriega was to reach a ninth-floor courtroom, two
airplanes flew overhead with banners saying ``Bye Bye, Tony'' and
``Rent This Ad When Fidel Falls,'' showing Cuban-American
solidarity with Panamanians.
   Private security officers supplemented the radio-equipped
marshals in the courthouse, and a half-dozen Miami police officers
kept an eye on a growing array of news crews with satellite dishes
and towers sprouting from their vans.
   Two Miami officers patrolled the front courthouse plaza where a
few Panamanian exiles expressed support for the prosecution of
Noriega. One woman wore a T-shirt with the words ``Noriega Enemy
No. 1 of Panama,'' and a man's shirt read ``Democracy for Panama''
in Spanish.

<HEAD>Ethics Committee Investigating Durenberger's Condo Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate ethics committee is widening its
investigation of Sen. Dave Durenberger to examine a deal in which
he made a profit by renting his Minneapolis condominium to himself.
   The Minnesota Republican disclosed the new area of investigation
Thursday and also said he has asked the panel to determine whether
it was proper for him and other senators to run non-profit
organizations that raise money from special interest groups, he
said.
   A think-tank Durenberger helped found is embroiled in
allegations that the senator used the organization for political
purposes.
   The ethics committee already was investigating allegations that
Durenberger laundered speaking fees and used special interest
groups to underwrite trips to Boston to visit his marriage
counselor.
   Durenberger said in a telephone interview Thursday from
Minneapolis that the committee decided at a meeting Dec. 21 to
investigate real estate transactions he used from 1983 to 1987 to
get reimbursed for stays in a condo in which he owned an interest.
   ``That's fine with me,'' Durenberger`said of the expanded
investigation. ``I think it's logical that the ethics committee
take on any issue in which there may not be a specific rule and
help the Rules Committee give specific definition.''
   The House bars its members from being reimbursed for staying in
a home in which they own an interest, but the Senate does not.
   The ethics committee's staff director, Wilson Abney, declined to
discuss its investigation.
   Durenberger sold his downtown Minneapolis condominium to a
partnership, in which he was a member, and later to a company owned
by his former campaign manager.
   In both instances, he continued to live there but used Senate
funds to pay his rent. Durenberger collected at least $9,947 in
living expense payments from the Senate from July 1983 to June 1987.
   Documents the senator provided to the Rules Committee on Dec. 22
disclosed that Durenberger signed back-dated real estate
partnership documents to justify reimbursements for 1983.
   Durenberger signed the documents in mid-1984 and dated them July
1983 to reflect an oral agreement made in 1983 to form the
partnership with a friend, Roger Scherer. Durenberger aides say the
back-dating was proper since Durenberger and Scherer did make the
agreement.
   Minnesota state Sen. William Luther, a Democrat, charged in his
Dec. 28 complaint that Durenberger```may have committed serious
violations of law (including violations of the Internal Revenue
code) and Senate rules'' through the real estate transactions.
   Luther charged that Durenberger failed to disclose the
partnership and income from Scherer to the Senate and that the
partnership may have been a phony attempt to claim tax deductions
available to landlords.
   The ethics committee hired a special counsel last fall to
investigate accusations that Durenberger earned $100,000 in
violation of Senate honoraria limits through a contract with a
Minneapolis publisher.
   Durenberger on Thursday denied allegations that he used his
think-tank, Americans for Generational Equity, for political
purposes. He resigned as chairman of the once-controversial
organization last month.
   AGE contended that working-age adults were being shortchanged by
government help to the elderly.
   Paul Hewitt, a board member whom Durenberger ousted as executive
director two years ago, claims Durenberger muzzled the
organization's staff to avoid hurting his reelection campaign in
1988.
   Durenberger, who raised money for AGE from many of the same
organizations that contributed to his campaign, denies the
allegation.

<HEAD>Provisional Gov't Seeks Closer Ties With Moscow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania's provisional government is
developing closer ties with Moscow than the Communist regime it
replaced, welcoming Soviet offers of aid and expecting a productive
visit by a top Soviet official.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze is to arrive in
Bucharest on Saturday for the first consultations between the new
government and the Kremlin since dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was
toppled Dec. 22 and executed with his wife Elena on Christmas Day.
   Silviu Brucan, a top foreign policy official, said Thursday the
new leadership had assurances from the Kremlin that Romania will
get extensive assistance, including plentiful energy supplies for
the harsh winter.
   Unlike other East European revolutions, which have pulled former
satellite nations further`from Moscow, Romania's uprising appears
to have strengthened what had been deteriorating relations between
Moscow and Bucharest.
   Ceausescu had long pursued maverick foreign and trade policies.
His refusal to follow the reforms of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev estranged Romania and the Soviet Union even more in
recent years.
   ``From the Soviet Union, we expect massive assistance,'' said
Brucan, a former ambassador to the United States. ``We have been
promised from the top in Moscow that we will receive aid in oil and
natural gas to help us overcome this difficult winter.''
   Brucan did not say whether this would mean additions to the
traditionally large energy supplies from the Soviet Union, paid for
in latter years by Ceausescu`with food exports.
   Ceausescu used the energy largely for industry, imposing drastic
curbs on heat and light consumption in freezing, dark homes and
offices.
   Romania now is led by the National Salvation Front and one of
its first acts was to lift the harsh decrees on energy saving.
   Soviet Embassy sources said another issue that is likely to come
up during Shevardnadze's visit is the Soviet republic Moldavia,
which consists largely of territory annexed in 1940 from Romania
under a secret protocol to the Hitler-Stalin Pact.
   Moldavians, who speak the same language as Romanians but were
forced to use the Cyrillic alphabet under Josef Stalin, want more
independence from the Kremlin, raising speculation they may seek
eventual reunification with Romania.
   Brucan glossed over questions on the issue, indicating the new
leadership wants to avoid strains with Moscow now that the Soviets
have expressed support for their revolution.
   While seeking aid from the Soviets, the new Romanian leaders are
also cultivating ties with the West, severely damaged in recent
years by Ceausescu's human rights policies and self-imposed
isolation in international affairs.
   Otto Lambsdorff, former West`German Economics Minister and
influential head of the Free Democrats`_ the junior partner in the
Bonn government _ visited Bucharest Thursday to discuss economic
aid.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and French
Premier Roland Dumas are expected next week, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Constantin Girbea said.
   Romania's new government has pledged to move the country toward
democracy and to hold free elections in April. Meantime, it has
overturned many of Ceausescu's most hated decrees, legalizing
abortion, street demonstrations and free travel. Private property
has been reinstated for peasants and the death penalty abolished.
   But many Romanians still are wary that the new leaders`have too
many links with the old Communist party.
   Men like provisional President Ion Iliescu and Brucan rose under
Communism to high positions, only to fall from Ceausescu's favor
and spend years in political isolation.
   Brucan said the provisional government plans to present a new
election law by the end of January.
   In a reversal of earlier declarations by the National Salvation
Front, Brucan said the Front intends to field candidates in the
planned April elections and will ``take part with all its might.''
   The half-dozen parties that would also run say they lack the
resources and the time for a fair contest against the Front, which
controls the mass media.
   In another development Thursday, news reports said families
whose homes were destroyed in fierce fighting in Bucharest after
Ceausescu was overthrown will move into spacious apartments built
for the late dictator's associates.
   The daily newspaper Truth, which replaced the Communist Party
daily after the revolution, said 110 of the apartments built along
the Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism, the dictator's pet
project, will be turned over to homeless familiesn

   The government suspended work on a $1.17
billion dam project to persuade an environment activist to give up
an 11-day-old hunger strike, news reports said.
   Sunderlal Bahaguna broke his fast after the government announced
it was stopping construction work on the Tehri Dam, Press Trust of
India news agency said Thursday.
   There was no indication if the government decision meant that
the project would be scrapped. However, state-run television said
Bahaguna would meet with Environment Minister Maneka Gandhi to
discuss the dam, billed as the largest hydroelectric project in
south Asia.
   The dam, 140 miles northeast of New Delhi on the Bhagirathi
River, has been criticized by environmentalists and geological
experts who say it is located in an unstable seismic zone and will
inundate valuable forest and farmland.
   Bahaguna, who has been awarded the Magsaysay award for his
efforts to protect the environment, has been an outspoken critic of
the project.
   The dam is scheduled to be completed in 1996. Its reservoir is
expected to displace 70,000 people, including 30,000 in the town of
Tehri, which will be submerged.

   The death toll in the cold wave
chilling Bangladesh and northern India passed 260 with reports that
22 people died of exposure when temperatures plunged to 37 degrees.
   The latest victims, all in Bangladesh, were mostly homeless and
impoverished people lacking shelter and adequate clothing.
   According to tallies from newspaper and news agency reports
Thursday, at least 104 people in Bangladesh have died of exposure
in the past three weeks.
   The death toll for the same period has reached 160 in
neighboring India, according to news reports. Most of the deaths
occurred among people sleeping on the ground in cities or in poor
rural areas.
   The victims included a sadhu _ a Hindu holy man _ in the western
state of Gujarat, the Times of India said. Sadhus wear little or no
clothing as part of their way of forsaking worldly goods.

   Former Republican Sen. Paul Laxalt has
announced that he is resigning from a law firm that recently drew
fire from conservatives for representing the Marxist government of
Angola.
   Laxalt will leave the firm of Laxalt, Washington, Perito and
Dubuc to form his own company, according to Tom Loranger, his
spokesman.
   ``The principal reason for leaving was that he wants his
independence,'' Loranger said in announcing Laxalt's resignation
Thursday. Loranger said Laxalt, a close friend of former President
Reagan's, will remain as a senior counselor at Laxalt, Washington.
   Laxalt, who represented Nevada until he decided not to seek
re-election in 1986, will form a new firm, The Paul Laxalt Group,
that will specialize in government relations, Loranger said.
   Loranger said he could not comment on whether the law firm's
decision to represent Angola played any role in Laxalt's leaving
the firm. Conservative groups had criticized Laxalt, Washington for
signed Angola as a client.
   ``We find it difficult to believe that someone who was so
closely affiliated with Ronald Reagan would knowingly associate
himself with such a repressive regime,'' said J. Barry Bitzer,

<HEAD>First Lady Gets Second Dose of Radiation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First lady Barbara Bush has undergone the
second of 10 radiation treatments for eye irritation caused by her
immune system disease.
   The 64-year-old first lady received the 10-minute radiation dose
early Thursday at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. She suffered no
aftereffects and returned to the White House for her normal daily
activities, said her press secretary, Anna Perez.
   Mrs. Bush is undergoing 10 consecutive days of radiation
treatments in an effort to eliminate swelling behind her eyes that
has caused her double vision and tearing for months.
   The eye problem results from Graves disease, a condition in
which the thyroid gland becomes overactive. The condition was
diagnosed last winter, and an earlier radioactive treatment and
drugs rendered the thyroid inactive.
   Treatment with a powerful steroid, prednisone, has failed to
correct the eye disorder, so doctors are using low-intensity
radiation aimed at swelling in the small muscles that control the
eyes as the next therapy.

<HEAD>Administration Rejected Recycling Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration considered but
rejected the idea of proposing new taxes on various materials in an
effort to encourage recycling, an administration official says.
   The official, who spoke on condition he not be named, said
Thursday that the proposal had been given a good chance of becoming
part of the president's fiscal 1991 budget request to Congress but
that it was finally rejected by the Office of Management and Budget.
   OMB Director Richard Darman stripped the proposed tax _ along
with other so-called ``user fees'' _ to avoid charges from
congressional Democrats that President Bush was violating his
no-new-taxes pledge, the official said.
   The proposal would have imposed new taxes on paper, glass,
plastic and metals that were not recycled. The Environmental
Protection Agency, which favored the tax concept as a way of
encouraging greater use of recycled materials by U.S. industry,
wants to reduce the nation's output of waste by 25 percent by 1992.
   Bush, as part of his 1988 presidential campaign, promised to
``make a national commitment to reduce waste by recycling and
developing technology that produces less waste.''
   By making products made from virgin materials more expensive,
supporters of the tax had argued it would encourage businesses to
use more recycled materials.

<HEAD>Agency, Watchdog Group Clash On Recall Performance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal agency says it began a record number
of investigations of possible automobile safety defects in 1989,
but a consumer advocacy group charges that the ``phony numbers''
are ``a smoke screen.''
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Thursday
that it launched 213 defect investigations last year, the highest
number in its 20-year history.
   Additionally, the agency said it influenced a record 7 percent
of the recalls ordered in 1989, when 6.7 million vehicles were
recalled for safety problems.
   But the Center for Auto Safety, a watchdog group, accused the
agency of reporting meaningless statistics to mask a poor
performance.
   ``Those are phony numbers,'' said Clarence Ditlow, the center's
executive director. ``What they're doing is creating a smoke screen
to conceal from the public that they're not enforcing the mandatory
recall law.''
   The center repeatedly has complained that under the Reagan
Administration, the agency abandoned investigations that should
have produced recalls. The agency said it pursued recalls when
needed but discontinued probes when it was plain there was no
widespread safety problem.
   The agency should not boast of influencing the highest
percentage of recalls ever when the number of recalls was well
below those of the late 1970s, Ditlow said.
   Jeffrey Miller, deputy administrator of the National Highway
Transportation Safety Administration, acknowledged that recalls
rose in the late 1970s and fell in the early 1980s, but said both
trends resulted largely from tire problems that were corrected.
There was a steady upward trend in recalls in the late 1980s, he
said.

   Montano did not explain how crime was reduced during the coup,
in which 113 people were killed. Fighting was limited to a few
scattered areas of this city of nearly 8 million people, but a
state of emergency gave police more search-and-seizure authority.

   The countdown was under way today
for launching the space shuttle Columbia on a 10-day mission to
deploy one satellite and rescue another.
   The clock began ticking at 4 p.m. Thursday when NASA test
director Jim McKnight issued the traditional call to stations at
the launch pad and in the control center. Liftoff is scheduled at
8:10 a.m. Monday for the first of a record 10 shuttle flights
planned in 1990.
   Columbia's five astronauts were to fly to Cape Canaveral late
today from their training base in Houston to make final launch
preparations.
   The commander is Dan Brandenstein. The other crew members are
pilot Jim Wetherbee and mission specialists Bonnie Dunbar, Marsha
Ivins and David Low. Brandenstein and Dunbar have made shuttle
flights, while the others will be on their first trip.
   Once in space they are to deploy a Navy communications satellite
and track down and retrieve a 21,400-pound science laboratory the
size of a small bus before it falls back to Earth.
   The laboratory, which has been orbiting nearly six years, will
be returned to Earth for a study of its 57 experiments and to
determine what has happened to it during long exposure to space.
   Liftoff had been scheduled to take place before Christmas, but
problems with the launch pad, which recently underwent a $50
million overhaul, forced a postponment.
   Fourteen hours of ``hold time'' were added to the countdown to
allow NASA to stop and deal with any problems with launch pad 39A,
which has not been used in four years.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two candidates who ran against each other in 1978
for state attorney general again are vying for the same office _
this time, for governor.
   Democrat Francis X. Bellotti and Republican William Weld made
separate announcements Thursday with both taking swipes at Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic governor who is not seeking
re-election, and with both positioning themselves as outsiders who
could solve the state's fiscal problems.
   Bellotti, 66, served 12 years as attorney general before
stepping down in 1986. He was elected lieutenant governor in 1962
and ran for governor unsucessfully in 1964.
   Weld, 44, went on to become U.S. attorney for Massachusetts and
assistant U.S. attorney general after his defeat by Bellotti.
   Both men said they would offer voters a change from the Dukakis
style; Bellotti, in particular, said he would take back the state
from ``technocrats and team players.''
   ``Massachusetts has become like the auto industry of a
generation gone by. We cannot solve our problems by adding chrome
fins and more fuel to an already unwieldy machine,'' Bellotti said.
   He said the most important issue facing the next governor will
be to turn around a state economy ``clearly in a decline.''
   Bellotti has opposed new taxes, but has not gone as far as Weld,
who took a no-new-taxes pledge after delivering his announcement
speech.
   ``Absolutely. Four years, no new taxes,'' Weld said when asked
if he would oppose any tax increases as governor.
   While outlining the serious fiscal problems he said the state
must face, Weld said the state still has its greatest economic
strenth, a well-educated work force.
   ``The same brainpower, energy and determination that made us the
center of the high-tech revolution can also place us at the center
of the global economic revolution that lies ahead in the '90s,''
Weld said.
   Bellotti faces Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy and House Taxation
Committee Chairman John Flood of Canton in the Democratic primary
election. In addition, Boston University President John Silber is
gearing up to run and Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn has not ruled out
a bid.
   Weld faces House Minority Leader Steven Pierce of Westfield,
former Congressman Paul Cronin and former Metropolitan District
Commissioner Guy Carbone in te GOP race.

   A Collin County justice of the peace who
faces a challenge in the Republican primary from a teen-ager hopes
to give the youngster a lesson in politics.
   ``I do question whether he has the experience necessary to do
the job,'' the 49-year-old James Murrell said of challenger John
Payton. ``It's not something you gain from sitting down and reading
a book.''
   Payton filed Tuesday to run against Murrell in the March 13 GOP
primary. The senior at Plano East High School will turn 18 before
the contest.
   He said his high school law classes and work on the debate team
and student government will prepare him for the job.
   ``My main goal is to be a politician,'' Payton said. ``That's
what I've always wanted to be. I know the basics of the law. I'll
gain experience through dealing with the community.''
   His parents gave him the necessary $300 filing fee after he
failed to get enough petition signatures over Christmas break to
waive the fee.
   ``We've had several people call offering help and support for
John,'' said his mother, Lorri Payton. ``John has always been
mature and responsible and he's always set his goals high. I'm not
surprised by his decision (to run).''
   Payton is following his father's footsteps. At age 18, Stan
Payton ran unsuccessfully for city clerk in Clovis, Calif., losing
by fewer than 100 votes.

   Six main pro-democracy groups said they are
forming a coalition for elections in May, but the groups are
divided over economic and foreign policy issues that will be
central to the campaign.
   Also Thursday, a parliamentary commission investigating
corruption charges against ousted Communist officials reported that
doctors were checking Erich Honecker to determine if the country's
disgraced former leader could be imprisoned.
   Honecker, 77, suffers from complications from gall bladder
surgery last August. He will have to be moved from the exclusive
residential compound where he was under house arrest after his
ouster on Oct. 18 because the complex is being converted to a
facility for the handicapped.
   ADN, the official news agency, said the police cordon around
Honecker's home had been lifted weeks ago and that the government
was looking for a suitable place to move him while the corruption
investigation continues.
   The government also said it wants to revive some intelligence
activities following last month's decision to disband the state
security agency.
   Pro-democracy opposition forces have demanded that no secret
police activities be carried out until a new government is seated
after the May 6 elections.
   In announcing the formation of a pro-democracy coalition, Social
Democratic Party leader Steffen Reiche said a united front against
the Communists was needed because reform groups were being wrongly
cast as sympathetic with rightist causes.
   Some of the opposition groups have shown more interest than the
Communists in joining in a confederation with West Germany,
although most have carefully avoided discussion of formal
reunification.
   The new coalition, called Election Alliance 90, includes New
Forum, Social Democratic Party, Democratic Awakening, Democracy
Now, the Initiative for Peace and Human Rights and the United Left.
   Detlef Poge of New Forum, the largest opposition group, conceded
that the groups are so divided on how the economy should be
restored that he doubted they could agree on a single position to
push in the elections.
   ``Everyone is so preoccupied with political problems that the
economic crisis is being ignored, and that's dangerous,'' Poge told
The Associated Press.
   As the opposition stumbles, the Communists' advantage of 40
years in power and strong political organization becomes more
apparent.
   The Communists still draw more voter support than any other
single political party, and they have been stirring voter concern
over the issue of a rightist resurgence.
   The Communists were stripped of their constitutional mandate to
rule on Dec. 1, reducing them to the status of other political
forces and transferring the leadership role to the premier instead
of the party chief.
   Unlike the reform movement in neighboring Czechoslovakia, East
German activists are disorganized, and in some cases at odds with
their own members.
   More than a dozen groups representing social interests from the
environment to women's issues are taking part in weekly
negotiations with the Communists and other established political
parties to draft reforms and advise the interim government.
   But the talks have been mired in bureaucratic infighting from
their Dec. 7 start.
   Leaders of the Democracy Now group have advocated a gradual
reunification with West Germany, while New Forum and the Social
Democrats contend East German must remain a sovereign nation.
   The opposition forces also disagree about how much Western
investment should be permitted to ease the nation's economic
crisis. Another divisive issue is whether East Germany should rely
on nuclear energy instead of the polluting brown coal that fires
much of the nation's industry.
   New Forum suffers a rift within its membership, with one
breakaway branch planning to form a political party on Jan. 27; the
main group rejects formal organization as a political force.
   New Forum on Thursday proposed that reform supporters start an
independent newspaper and begin publishing weekly by the end of the
month.
   ADN said printing facilities, editorial offices and money for
operating the newspaper would have to be raised through donations.
   Nine leading reform activists issued an appeal for support. Theu
promised the weekly, to be called The Others, would address an
array of political and economic issues.

<HEAD>Saddam Offers Plan To Revive Talks With Iran, Warns Israel</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 12 grafs of quotes, details and background; no pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein today proposed a
three-point plan for reviving stalled peace negotiations with Iran,
including direct meetings and an unconditional release of ailing
and disabled prisoners.
   Saddam also praised his country's advanced arms industry and
warned Israel against attacking Iraqi scientific or military
installations after the recent launch of long-range missiles and a
rocket reportedly capable of putting a satellite in space.
   The Iraqi president spoke in a 30-minute address aired live by
radio and television to mark the 69th anniversary of the creation
of the Iraqi Army.
   ``We are seeking to open a new door for a dignified peace with
Iran,'' he said.
   Fighting in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war was halted by a
cease-fire that went into effect Aug. 20, 1988. U.S. and European
military analysts have estimated that 1 million people were killed
and 1.7 million wounded, two-thirds of them Iranians.
   The war grew out of border skirmishes between Iran and Iraq
after the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini took power in Iran in
1979.
   But Iran and Iraq had been in dispute for years over the
120-mile Shatt-al-Arab waterway, the confluence of the Tigris and
Euphrates Rivers that flows into the Persian Gulf and forms the
southern boundary between the two countries.
   To revive the peace talks, Saddam suggested that ``direct
meetings between representatives of both leaderships be held
alternately in Tehran and Baghdad under the auspices of the
secretariat-general of the United nations.
   ``The direct dialogue will aim at reaching a common
understanding of the clauses of (U.N. Security Council) Resolution
598 and fix a timetable for its implementation ... provided that
the talks are completed within a period not exceeding three
months.''
   The Security Council adopted the resolution in July 1987. A year
later, both countries agreed to it and stopped the fighting. But
peace talks launched under U.N. sponsorship after the truce were
quickly deadlocked.
   Tehran refused to discuss a settlement before Iraq withdraw from
lands it occupied before the cease-fire, and Baghdad insisted on
working out a new border demarcation accord that gives it total
sovereignty over Shatt-Al-Arab waterway.
   Under a pre-war accord, the border between the two countries ran
down the middle of the waterway, which forms Iraq's sole outlet to
the gulf.
   Iran claims Iraq holds 1,065 square miles of its territory. But
U.N. experts say the Iraqis occupy only 260 square miles.
   As a second step toward renewing the peace talks, Saddam
proposed ``an immediate exchange of all wounded and sick prisoners
of war under the supervision of the International Committee of the
Red Cross.''
   That, he said, would be followed by the release of the
longest-held POWs, mainly those captured in the early stages of the
war, which broke out in September 1980.
   He also called for registering thousands of prisoners who have
not been included in lists provided to the Red Cross.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 prisoners held by Iran and
19,284 in Iraqi camps. But U.N. officials and diplomats say both
sides together hold at least 100,000 POWs.
   The Red Cross mediated an agreement to repatriate the ailing and
crippled POWs immediately after the cease-fire. But the accord
broke down after the release of only 400 prisoners with Iran and
Iraq accusing each other of falsifying the number of captives who
were seeking asylum.
   The Red Cross estimates 1,000 ailing or disabled POWs are still
held by both sides.

<HEAD>Yellowstone Officials Warn Visitors To Stay Away From Coyotes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yellowstone National Park
officials are warning visitors to keep their distance from coyotes
in the park following the attack of a skier by one of the animals.
   Park rangers have been searching for the coyote that may have
attacked Brian Dean, 27, on Wednesday, sending him to a Montana
hospital where doctors were deciding whether to begin rabies
treatments on the man.
   Dean, an employee of the park's concessionaire, was attacked
while he was cross-country skiing alone near the Biscuit Basin.
   Park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo said the Oak Lawn, Ill., man
spotted the animal while coming down a hill, but had no chance to
stop or go around it. The coyote then knocked Dean to the ground
and attacked him while Dean beat the animal with one of his skis.
   Dean suffered lacerations and puncture wounds to his head, neck
and arms. He was able to ski to a nearby road where a snowmobiler
gave him a ride to Old Faithful. From there, he was taken to West
Yellowstone, Mont. He was reported in good condition at Deaconess
Hospital in Bozeman, Mont.
   The attack, the most severe in the park involving a coyote since
at least the early 1970s, was one of several recent incidents in
which coyotes acted bold or aggressive toward humans, Anzelmo said.
   ``The message is clearly please, don't approach the wildlife,
don't feed the wildlife and be especially cautious around coyotes
you may happen to see,'' she said. ``The extent of this attack is
extremely rare. But when coyotes become habituated to people, they
will get bold.''
   A week ago a mother used a ski pole to fend off a coyote that
charged her young son near Biscuit Basin, and in another incident
one of the animals jumped over the lap of a woman sitting on a
bench near the Old Faithful geyser, said Anzelmo.
   Officials believe the animals have become used to humans because
of visitors who have been giving the coyotes handouts, she added.
   ``They become habituated to people and conditioned to
handouts,'' she said. ``They expect handouts and get bolder and
bolder. Most of the time, you can scare them away. But some animals
at Old Faithful can get quite bold.''
   She added that reports of ``beggar coyotes'' have been common in
the park in past years and officials often heard reports of the
animals approaching or running into people.

<TEXT>
   Police today were questioning a man in
the slayings of 14 women and the disappearances of two others since
1988, according to news reports.
   The man, who was reportedly convicted in 1972 in the
strangulation deaths of two children, confessed to 10 of the
killings, television station WOKR reported.
   But investigators would not confirm they had a suspect, saying
only that they would release information on a breakthrough in the
case at a news conference today at state police headquarters in
Canandaigua, about 25 miles southeast of Rochester.
   Police said late Thursday that no charges had been filed, but
the Rochester Democrat &amp; Chronicle quoted an unidentified police
source as saying, ``Through his statements he had knowledge that
only the killer could have.''
   Area newspapers and television stations reported that a
45-year-old food service worker told authorities where they could
find the bodies of the two missing women.
   By midnight, officials had found one of those bodies, in West
Creek in the town of Clarkson, but had not located the second,
according to the Democrat &amp; Chronicle.
   The Post-Standard of Syracuse reported that the suspect would be
charged and arraigned on murder charges today in at least eight of
the deaths.
   The suspect pleaded guilty in 1972 in Watertown to the
strangulation slayings of a 8-year-old Rochester girl and a
10-year-old Watertown boy, the Democrat &amp; Chronicle said. The girl,
who was visiting the boy in Watertown, also had been sexually
assaulted.
   The man was sentenced to 25 years in prison in October 1972 and
paroled in 1987, according to reports. He had been denied parole
eight times. According to reports, he was moved from Binghamton and
two towns in Delaware County after residents became upset that he
had settled in their communities.
   The suspect was found Wednesday about 15 miles west of Rochester
where police were searching for a missing woman, WOKR said. He was
questioned and released.
   Later that day, searchers found the remains of June Cicero, 34,
frozen in a creek in Ogden. State police Sgt. Paul Sucher said
Cicero was involved in prostitution.
   On Thursday, the man again was taken into custody for
questioning and searchers found another body, believed to be that
of a female, in the town of Sweden.
   About 60 state troopers, forest rangers from the state
Department of Environmental Conservation, and town of Ogden police
searched the Monroe County towns of Ogden, Riga and Sweden for
clues into the latest deaths.
   Most of the women, including Cicero, were involved in
prostitution or drugs. Sgt. Paul Sucher of the state police said
Cicero was also a prostitute.
   Besides the two bodies found this week, 12 other women have been
found since March 1988.
   At least four of the victims were strangled, one was shot, two
were beaten to death and one was hit by a car while fleeing an
attacker. Police have not determined the cause of the other victims.

   The storm that dumped heavy snow in the Southwest earlier this
week churned into the central Plains today and mild Pacific air
salved the Midwest and Northeast with warmer-than-usual
temperatures.
   Thunderstorms rocked northeast Texas and southern Arkansas and
pelted north-central Oklahoma with quarter-sized hail quarters
before moving into Kansas today. Rain fell in much of Kansas and
Missouri, the lower Mississippi Valley, eastern Texas, Alabama and
northwest Florida on Thursday.
   Showers soaked western Washington state and snow blanketed some
higher elevations in eastern Washington.
   Up to 5 inches of snow fell on parts of eastern Colorado and
western Kansas Thursday evening. Rain changed to snow overnight
across parts of Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri.
   A westerly flow of air should bring mild air to the Midwest for
the weekend, extending the unseasonably warm temperatures with
highs in the 30s and 40s and lows in the teens and 20s.
   The high of 39 degrees at Marquette, Mich., on Thursday broke
the previous record high for the date of 37 set in 1964 and tied in
1984.
   Several low pressure systems will continue their westerly flow
across the northern Plains, spawning patchy clouds and some snow
over the Dakotas, Minnesota and Wisconsin through tonight.
   A trough of low pressure stretched from the northern Rockies
into the central Plains today. Weak high pressure was to the east
over Minnesota and Wisconsin.
   More snow was predicted today for Michigan's Upper and northern
Lower Peninsulas, with lows from 10 to the 20s. By Saturday, cloudy
to partly sunny skies are expected statewide with highs from the
mid teens to lower 30s.
   The changing weather is wrecking the roads, said John Joy,
spokesman for the Oakland County Road Commission.
   ``We're getting potholes big enough to swallow Volkswagens,'' he
said. ``The concrete is more resilient and there's a heaving of the
asphalt.''
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with sunny
skies in the Southwest.
   Thursday's high for the nation was 84 degrees at Kingsville,
Texas.

<TEXT>
   After many years of internment and
waiting, the first group of former Vietnamese ``re-education camp''
inmates allowed to resettle in the United States arrived in the
Thai capital today.
   A total of 156 inmates and their families arrived on morning and
afternoon charter flights from Ho Chi Minh City, a U.S. Embassy
spokesman said. Many will go to California after a week in a Thai
immigration facility.
   Their arrival began the first major resettlement of the former
inmates, some of whom were interned for more than a decade because
they served the U.S.-backed South Vietnam government that Communist
forces toppled in April 1975.
   ``I cannot say how happy I am after all these years,'' said
Nguyen Cao Son, who taught at a South Vietnam military academy
during the war.
   He said he was held for nearly three years of re-education then
jailed for three years for trying to flee the country by boat in
the late 1970s.
   ``I have come to the free world,'' said Nguyen Thuong Hiep, who
sat with his wife and two children at Bangkok airport. ``Everyone
loves their country, but our country suffers.''
   Ho Van Phuoc, a former army helicopter pilot, said he saw about
25 people shot for trying to flee one of the camps, and many others
died of disease.
   Two daughters of one former inmate wore white lace dresses and
red ribbons in their hair to celebrate the occasion.
   But Nguyen Hoang Bich Van, the 18-year-old daughter of one
former inmate, was not as happy. She left behind a boyfriend and
other friends.
   Hundreds of thousands of people were put into camps for manual
labor and political study because of their ties with the former
government.
   Vietnam has released large numbers of people from the camps in
recent years and Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said in June that
only about 120 people remained in custody.
   Like others, Nguyen Cao Son said he hoped for democratic changes
in Vietnam that would allow him to return home one day. He said
there were a few demonstrations there last year, and that he hoped
the government would accommodate the people's wishes.
   ``We don't want a situation like that in Romania to happen in
Vietnam,'' he said.
   Nearly 2,000 former inmates and their families will leave
Vietnam by the end of March, said Richard Kocher, head of the
office in Thailand of the International Organization for Migration.
   Officials had no overall figure on the number of former
prisoners to be resettled under an agreement reached last July. The
U.S. negotiator, senior State Department official Robert L.
Funseth, said then that it would help heal ``the last big wound
remaining from the war.''
   Kocher said U.S. officials began interviewing the former
detainees and conducting medical examinations in late October.
   The United States has resettled hundreds of thousands of
Vietnamese since the war, but political bickering and other
problems barred progress on the former re-education inmates.
   A U.S. source in Bangkok has said Washington estimated there
were about 100,000 Vietnamese with re-education connections among
the 600,000 who have applied to emigrate to the United States. The
Vietnamese government estimated former inmates and their families
total 550,000 people, he said.

   A crippled Iranian tanker that spilled
millions of gallons of oil off the Moroccan coast was turned away
today by Portugal.
   Iran said the 100-square-mile spill occurred when the tanker,
the Khark 5, exploded last month after one of its storage tanks was
damaged in a storm.
   There has been no leakage from the tanker's two ruptured storage
tanks since Monday, according to the Dutch salvage company Smit
Tak. The 283,632-ton ship's original cargo was 72 million gallons
of crude oil.
   But nearby countries were turning the ship away from ports where
it could transfer its remaining cargo of crude to a second vessel.
   A Portuguese navy patrol boat was escorting the Khark 5 away
from the Portuguese island of Madeira, north of the Canaries, after
the tanker entered its territorial waters there, the national news
agency Lusa said today.
   Morocco also has refused the tanker safe haven, and the Spanish
Merchant Marine denied a request by the ship's owners to tow the
1,837-foot vessel to calm waters off the southern coast of Tenerife
in the Canary Islands, a government official said.
   Smit Tak, which is commanding the three tugs towing the Khark 5,
said an empty National Iranian Oil Co. tanker, the Shir Khooh, was
headed to meet the Khark 5.
   If the Khark 5 is unable to go to a nearby island, Smit Tak said
it planned to tow the tanker to the Cape Verde archipelago, through
more than 1,200 miles of open seas, south of the ship's current
position. The country is a former Portuguese colony off the West
African coast.
   The tanker was 400 miles north of Las Palmas, in the Canary
Islands, on Dec. 19 when an explosion ripped open its hull,
creating an oil slick that crept toward the Moroccan coastline.
   Oil from the tanker could still reach the Moroccan coast, but
the 19 million-gallon spill has dissipated and no longer poses the
major environmental threat it had in recent days, experts said
Thursday.
   They said more than 90 percent of the spill had either
evaporated, dissolved in the sea, broken up in high waves or been
dispersed by chemicals sprayed on the water to fight the slick.
   Darko Domovic, a technical expert with the center, said only
remnants of oil could wash ashore over the next two months.
   ``There is very, very little oil left on the sea surface,'' he
said. ``It would only be a question of normal cleanup with buckets
and spades.''
   Hundreds of sailors laid floating barriers to stop the oil's
advance toward the Moroccan oyster farming town of Oualidyia, where
the leading edge of the oil was 20 miles off the coast Thursday.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said a storm ripped a
hole in one of the tanker's storage tanks, causing the explosion
that started the leak.
   Aqazadeh said reports of environmental damage caused by the
spill were exaggerated and that the ship met all safety
specifications.
   The vessel, built in 1975, was damaged at least three times in
Iraqi air strikes in the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq war. The
normal life span of a tanker of its size is 15 to 20 years.

<HEAD>Authorities Release Three Jailed Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The government has quietly released three Beijing
college students jailed for taking part in the spring democracy
movement, and Chinese sources said today that other activists also
have been released recently.
   However, they said the releases do not indicate a softening of
Chinese leaders' opposition to democratic reform.
   They said additional soldiers were brought into Beijing after
the Romanian revolution last month prompted protest attempts here
and illegal posters at several Beijing campuses.
   Most soldiers are inside walled compounds in the city and
military bases in the suburbs, and the increased presence could not
be detected.
   It is widely believed, however, that troops and police have been
on alert for the past two weeks, with all leaves canceled, and that
plans to lift martial law were called off. Martial law was imposed
in Beijing in May during massive pro-democracy protests that were
crushed by the army June 3-4.
   College students said three students from the Beijing College of
Aeronautics who were arrested during the summer returned to their
dormitories Thursday night. They were pale from their incarceration
but said they had been treated well in jail, fellow students said.
   The school refused to say if the three would be allowed to
return to class.
   Other sources said some older intellectuals who supported the
protests also have been released in the past few weeks, but no
figures were available. None of those released was prominent in the
protests.
   A school official at the Beijing College of Aeronautics was
quoted as telling students there that ``some students not only at
this school but seven others'' wanted to demonstrate in support of
the Romanian rebellion, which led to the ouster of Stalinist leader
Nicolae Ceausescu. The official warned the Chinese students not to
protest, saying it would affect their lives.
   More than 100 students at the aeronautics college tried last
week to bicycle in a group off campus, without any posters, in a
silent show of support for Romania's uprising, but they were
stopped at the gate, sources there said.
   Similar efforts also were reported previously at two other
schools, but the official's comments were the first indication that
protest efforts were so widespread. One source said security forces
have been authorized to shoot if necessary to stop students from
marching off campuses.
   Four illegal protest posters also were reported at Beijing
University, Beijing Normal University and Qinghua University during
the Romanian street fighting.
   There have been scattered unofficial reports of worker unrest in
Beijing, Shanghai and Chifeng in Inner Mongolia. However,
authorities refuse to answer questions about unrest or protests,
creating a climate in which rumors flourish and confirmation is
almost impossible to obtain.
   Under martial law regulations, all questions and requests for
interviews must be submitted to the Beijing City Foreign Affairs
Office, which generally does not respond.

   He would wake up before dawn, put on
baggy shorts and do calisthenics on the patio. Later, he would don
a white robe and a crucifix and try to persuade Manuel Antonio
Noriega to get out of his house.
   As the Vatican's ambassador in Panama, Monsignor Sebastian Laboa
became the reluctant host to the fugitive military dictator on
Christmas Eve, four days after 26,000 U.S. troops descended on
Panama City to topple Noriega.
   For 10 days, the papal mission was a building under siege,
surrounded by barbed wire, soldiers in battle array, tanks and
helicopters.
   The 67-year-old Laboa _ short, a bit plump, his gray hair
receding _ is both a priest and a lawyer and is considered savvy,
open and street smart.
   He needed all those qualities in the stalemate that followed.
   In the end, embassy officials told Noriega that if he didn't
give up, the Panamanian government would be invited in to take him
out, said the Rev. Javier Villanueva, assistant to the papal nunio.
A senior Bush administration official said Laboa gave Noriega a
noon Thursday deadline to get out.
   Noriega walked out of the embassy Wednesday night, surrendered
to U.S. forces and was flown to Florida to face federal
drug-trafficking charges.
   It was not the first time Laboa found himself at the center of a
Panamanian political firestorm.
   He sheltered Guillermo Endara after a coup attempt failed to
overthrow Noriega in October. Endara led the opposition to Noriega
and now is president.
   Laboa also mediated between the Basque separatist organization
ETA and the Spanish government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
Besides Noriega and a handful of his henchmen, four ETA members
sought refuge at the embassy.
   Laboa said little publicly as he labored through sticky
negotiations with U.S. military officials, who made their
headquarters at the St. Agustin church school across from the
Vatican mission.
   The papal nuncio was their exclusive conduit to Noriega and when
the former dictator surrendered Wednesday night, Laboa was given
most of the credit.
   ``Father Laboa was the most instrumental person in making this
happen,'' said Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, commander of U.S. Army
South.
   Noriega did not find life comfortable inside the two-story
compound. He slept in a small room with a submachine gun under his
bed.
   Just in case Noriega got ideas, Laboa told the troops outside
they could storm the mission if the former strongman took hostages.
   Laboa kept Noriega in strict isolation, forbade the embassy
staff to talk with him, let Noriega's faulty television set stay on
the blink and refused to feed him vegetarian meals. Noriega does
not eat meat.
   On New Year's Eve, the priest served Noriega pasta, one of
Laboa's favorite foods.
   Born in the northern Basque town of San Juan Guipuzcoa in Spain,
Laboa became a priest at the age of 26 and a lawyer in Italy six
years later. He became Pope John Paul II's representative in Panama
in 1982.
   He was visiting Salamanca in Spain when the U.S. troops invaded
and hurried back to Panama.
   Noriega wasn't the only one Laboa kept under control.
   He also had to deal with hundreds of U.S. soldiers who ringed
the embassy around the clock.
   The soldiers set up an outdoor system with four powerful
speakers and blasted the building with rock, heavy metal, rap, and
country music.
   Laboa was not amused. Word went out that ``steps'' would be
taken if the racket didn't stop. It did.
   During the first confusing days of Noriega's sanctuary, troops
searched Laboa's car on at least one occasion and he was detained
while soldiers rummaged in the car for weapons and ``non-diplomatic
personnel'' _ Noriega, they hoped.
   From a nearby hotel hundreds of reporters and photographers with
zoom and special night lenses kept vigil.
   At dawn, Laboa would emerge wearing a sweatshirt bearing with
the word ``Gago,'' a local supermarket. He would bend, stretch and
walk at a fast pace on the embassy's palm-shrouded patio.
   In the afternoon, he darted in and out of the black iron embassy
gates in a long white robe, spending hours with U.S. officials.
   In the end, Laboa's patience wore thin. And he was losing some
of his popularity.
   Hours before Noriega's surrender, 20,000 demonstrators marched
to the embassy demanding the unwanted guest be kicked out.
   ``We respect the Catholic Church,'' read one sign. ``But excuse
us, we don't respect you, Monsignor Laboa.''
   Vatican embassy officials said Laboa told Noriega bluntly that
the building's diplomatic immunity would be lifted at some point.
   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, commander of the Southern Command in
charge of the Panama invasion, said the United States owed Laboa
special thanks.
   He said the priest showed ``extraordinary competence and
statesmanlike conduct.''

<HEAD>AIDS Official: Entertainment Industry Must Change Sex Portrayals.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The entertainment industry should portray
sex responsibly, according to a recommendation being considered by
a national commission studying the battle against AIDS.
   ``If our (TV and movie) heroes can't say or use the `condom'
word, I think our education efforts are doomed to failure,'' said
James Allen, director of the AIDS program office of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services.
   Allen made his comments Thursday before a working group of the
National Commission on AIDS.
   The three-member working group, chaired by Ramsey County
Commissioner Diane Ahrens, is a subcommittee of the 15-member
national commission created by Congress to advise lawmakers and
President Bush on the development of coordinated public policy on
AIDS.
   ``I don't care if we get a vaccine or a cure, it's never going
to be as effective as not becoming infected with the AIDS virus,''
Allen told the group.
   The commission, expected to meet again today to work on
recommendations based on Thursday's session, heard testimony all
day from experts representing federal, state and local government
agencies around the country.
   ``Leadership is crucial at every level,'' said Larry Kessler,
commission member and head of the Boston AIDS Action Committee.
``Leadership means stepping outside one's agenda and working for
the common good.''
   The commission heard testimony Thursday about the increasing
number of AIDS patients, many of whom lack health insurance. State
and local governments are forced to scramble for funds to take care
of them.
   The subcommittee also discussed how politicians need to become
more involved in raising the awareness of the risk of transmission
of the disease.

<TEXT>
   Police issued arrest warrants for three
train employees accused of fleeing Pakistan's worst rail disaster,
which officials said today left at least 307 people dead and 340
injured.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto called it a ``national tragedy''
as she toured hospitals in the nearby city of Sukkur. ``The
possibility of sabotage cannot be ruled out,'' she told reporters.
   Ms. Bhutto said she ordered two investigations _ one judicial
and one by Pakistan Railways.
   Railway spokesmen said an improperly set switch apparently sent
a loaded, express passenger train crashing into a parked freight
train early Thursday just north of Sangi.
   Three of the green-and-yellow passenger cars were crushed as
they piled together, and three more were heavily damaged.
   Pakistan's minister for railways, Zafar Leghari, said during a
visit to the scene of the wreck that sabotage or conspiracy were
possible causes.
   He said he based his suspicion on the disappearance of the Sangi
station manager and two switchmen.
   Army troops cordoned off the maze of twisted and splintered
steel as about 1,000 rescue workers spent a second day cutting
through crushed passenger cars in search of more bodies and
survivors.
   Dozens of bodied lay wrapped in sheets and blankets under an
outdoor tent in Sukkur's Civil Hospital. Local people, some
bringing tea and sweets, pitched in to help care for the hundreds
of injured.
   Casualty counts continued to fluctuate, but rescue officials
said at least 307 bodies had been recovered from the wreckage by
this afternoon and that about 340 injured were accounted for in
hospitals.
   Dr. Gulzar Ahmad Sheikh, civil surgeon of Sukkur district,
estimated the number of people treated since the accident at around
700. He said many victims were treated and released at first aid
stations.
   Railway officials said there appeared to be more bodies trapped
in the first three passenger cars, which were crushed together in
the impact.
   Officials said many survivors removed dead relatives for
immediate burial and dozens of injured were treated and released
from first-aid stations.
   Ms. Bhutto canceled today's birthday observances for her late
father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was overthrown in a 1977 military
coup and hanged in 1979.
   Police were questioning the engineer of the passenger train,
identified as Payra Masih, who was found alive in the driver's seat
of the overturned locomotive.
   Railway officials said he tried to brake the train to avert the
crash. His fireman in the cab was killed.
   Muktar Ahmad Abassi, regional traffic officer for Pakistan
Railways at Sukkur, said the passenger train Zakaria Bahauddin,
named after a Moslem saint, was traveling south overnight on a
500-mile run from Multan to Karachi with considerably more
passengers than its 1,408-seat capacity.
   When it approached Sangi, which it was supposed to bypass, an
improperly set switch threw it onto a siding where an empty, 67-car
freight train stood, he said.
   The passenger train crashed into it with a speed of at least 35
mph, Abassi said, crushing and derailing cars.
   Pakistan's previous worst rail disaster occurred more than 30
years ago and killed about 200 people.

Kidnapped</HEAD>

   The murder of a reputed crack dealer apparently
was linked to the kidnapping of his 12-year-old brother, whose
severed finger accompanied a ransom demand to the family, a
published report said.
   Police investigators believe Richard Porter, 25, may have been
negotiating with kidnappers for the release of his younger brother
Wednesday night before he was killed, according to today's Daily
News.
   Porter was found dead, shot several times, in the Bronx early
Thursday, said Sgt. Mary Wrensen, a police department spokeswoman.
   His brother, William, was abducted on his way to school Dec. 5
and was still missing, detectives told the News.
   The family received a hysterical taped message the next day from
the boy, along with his severed right index finger and two of his
rings, the paper said.
   ``They cutted my finger off ... They said if you don't do as
they say, they are going to cut my hand off,'' a terrified William
said on the tape, according to the News. ``Please help ... I love
you, Mommy.''
   In a series of notes and phone calls that ended on Dec. 10, the
kidnappers first demanded $500,000, then $350,000 for the boy's
return, the News said.
   Detectives told the News that the elder brother had refused to
cooperate with police in the investigation and may have been
negotiating for the boy's release on his own.
   ``It seems robbery was not the motive, as identification and
property were found on him,'' Wrensen said. ``Apparently he was
dumped there.''
   Police refused to comment on the kidnapping case so as not to
jeopardize William's safety.
   The last contact that the family had with the kidnappers was a
note they received on Dec. 10.
   ``We still want the money. The child is in pain and he needs
medical attention,'' the note said.
   Richard Porter was a local drug distributor who controlled
several street sellers, the News said.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha,
back from his first trip to Eastern Europe, said today his
government hopes to establish diplomatic relations with Hungary and
possibly other long-hostile Warsaw Pact countries.
   Botha also said his government sought to attract Eastern
Europeans to South Africa to ease a manpower shortage in skilled
jobs. Anti-apartheid groups have denounced the recruitment
campaign, saying the government should be training blacks rather
than wooing white immigrants.
   In Budapest, Botha met Thursday with Hungarian Foreign Minister
Guyla Horn. Hungary's national MTI news agency reported afterward:
``Both sides expressed their intention to gradually establish
official relations.''
   The African National Congress, which for decades has received
Soviet bloc backing for its guerrilla campaign against
white-minority rule, accused Hungary of betraying South Africa's
black majority and forming ``a racist partnership with apartheid.''
   However, Botha told reporters before leaving Budapest that ``no
agreements were concluded'' with Hungary. And Horn reminded Botha
that Hungary ``opposes any kind of racial, national or ethnic
discrimination, and condemns all manifestations of apartheid,'' MTI
said.
   At a news conference today at Johannesburg's airport, Botha said
the two countries would investigate possible cooperation in trade,
industrial development and tourism. He said South Africans could
now travel to Hungary ``without any problem.''
   Asked about the prospect of formal ties with other Eastern
European countries, Botha replied: ``There is already contact, and
we are talking.''
   Before Eastern Europe's recent political upheavals, Warsaw Pact
nations were aligned closely with most Third World countries in
vehement opposition to South Africa's white-controlled government.
This alliance advocated isolation of South Africa as a means of
forcing an end to its racial segregation policies and bringing
about black-majority rule.
   Hungary was one of the first East bloc countries to accept
reform. In October, its ruling Communist Party was disbanded in
favor of a party that swore allegiance to democratic ideals. On
March 25, Hungary is scheduled to hold its first multiparty
elections since 1948.
   Alfred Nzo, secretary-general of the African National Congress,
said Hungary's decision to receive Botha demonstrated ``bad faith
and a cynical disregard for international agreements.''
   ``Only 10 days ago, representatives of the Hungarian government
assured the ANC that they have no contact with the apartheid
regime,'' he said, accusing the Hungarians of trying to ``betray
the majority of the people of South Africa by forming a racist
partnership with apartheid.''
   ``Hungary cannot expect to maintain normal relations with the
peoples of Africa while it befriends the enemy of our continent,''
he said.
   Botha said he and Horn discussed the possibility of a gradually
broadening relationship that would include ``interest offices,
consular offices and eventually embassies.''
   ``But this will depend on what happens in South Africa and
Hungary over the next few months,'' he said.
   Botha's two-day stay was the first known visit by a senior South
African official to a Warsaw Pact country. While there, he said his
government is committed to forging a new constitution that would
end white domination.
   MTI said Hungary ``is prepared to hold dialogue ... with South
Africa, parallel to maintaining its position'' against apartheid.
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp., in a commentary
today on Botha's trip, said: ``The hostility shown by the United
States Congress and others (through sanctions) makes it imperative
that new friendships and partnerships be formed.'' It suggested the
East bloc might seek to tap South Africans' mining expertise.
   ``There is real hope that South Africa is poised to start
breaking out of her international isolation,'' the network said.

   The story behind a grim inner-city shooting that
stirred racial fears turned out to be a lie as the storyteller
committed suicide after his brother implicated him, authorities
said.
   The body of Charles Stuart, who became a sympathetic figure as
the suburban victim of a Boston shooting that killed his pregnant
wife and left him wounded, was pulled from the Boston Harbor.
   Stuart's tale to police was that he and his 30-year-old wife,
Carol, were robbed and shot by a black man after they left a
childbirth class Oct. 23. Stuart, a fur store manager, also
reportedly identified a black man in a police lineup as the killer.
   The story, Suffolk County District Attorney Newman Flanagan
said, ``is not true.''
   Mrs. Stuart, a lawyer, died hours after the shooting. The
Stuarts' son, delivered by Caesarean section, died 17 days later.
   Hospitalized at the time his wife was buried, a letter from
Stuart was read at the funeral.
   ``Now you sleep away from me,'' he wrote. ``I'll never know the
feeling of your hand in mine, but I will always feel you. I miss
you, and I love you.''
   Gov. Michael Dukakis and Mayor Raymond Flynn were among those
who attended the funeral. Flynn had called Stuart a hero for
directing police to his wife by their car phone despite being
wounded himself.
   ``The whole case did the entire city an injustice,'' Flynn said
Thursday. ``I've been on this Earth 50 years, and I've read a lot
of suspense stories, but I've not heard anything as bizarre and
troubling as this.''
   Blacks also reacted angrily _ because the story touched the
worst fears among white America about black inner-city violence
when it exploded in headlines and on news reports nationwide.
   ``Black people in particular have to look at it and wonder what
hope we have for justice in a country that took this man's lie and
made him and his family a symbol of national mourning,'' said Chuck
Turner, director of the Center for Community Action of the
Episcopal City Mission in Boston's largely black Roxbury section.
   Authorities were theorizing that Stuart's motive in the slaying
was to collect life insurance policies taken out on his wife, The
Boston Globe and Boston Herald reported today. Both newspapers
quoted unidentified sources.
   Stuart recently collected $83,000 from a $100,000 policy on his
wife, the Globe reported, citing a source within an unidentified
insurance company. The newspaper said the policies on his wife
totaled at least $500,000.
   Police said there were reports that Charles Stuart had tested
positive for cocaine after the shooting, the Herald reported today.
Prosecutors who spoke on the record said there was no evidence of
an insurance motive or drug involvement.
   Stuart, 29, jumped off the 300-foot Tobin Bridge hours after his
brother's disclosures to authorities. He left a suicide note in his
car.
   Flanagan said the case remained active, but he refused to
disclose details or the contents of the suicide note.
   ``Basically, it's fair to say, he could not handle the
allegations or statements made about him,'' the prosecutor said.
   Flanagan said he ordered police to arrest Stuart in his wife's
killing. But police could not find him late Wednesday or early
Thursday. Officials said Stuart apparently knew he was a suspect,
but they did not say how he knew.
   A black man, William Bennett, had been identified in news
accounts as a suspect. He was never charged in the Stuart case, and
the prosecutor has now cleared him.
   Bennett said that was not enough.
   ``My life and my family's lives have been ruined and no one is
willing to take responsibility,'' he said.
   Stuart's 23-year-old brother, Matthew, a paint factory employee
who was a pallbearer at Mrs. Stuart's funeral, had long suspected
that his brother's account of the shooting was false, according to
his attorney, John Perenyi.
   He stepped forward with his fears on Wednesday because he was
afraid an innocent man might be charged, Perenyi said, adding that
his client offered no explanation for why his brother might have
committed the crime.
   ``He was really at a loss to give me a motive,'' he said. ``He
didn't think his brother was into gambling, drinking or other
women.''
   On the night of the shooting, Matthew Stuart said his brother
had asked him to meet him near the hospital where the Stuarts had
attended the childbirth class, according to Perenyi.
   Matthew Stuart said his brother told him he would pass a bag to
him through the car window. He said he took the bag, which included
a nickel-plated snubnosed revolver, according to Perenyi. The
lawyer said Matthew Stuart did not see Mrs. Stuart in the front
seat.
   A search Thursday of the Pines River in Stuart's hometown of
Revere turned up evidence mentioned by Matthew Stuart, including a
Gucci bag, wallet, makeup and other personal belongings of Mrs.
Stuart. The gun was not found.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has donated
the $200,000 he received for winning the Nobel Peace Prize to a
fund created to rebuild the country.
   Walesa made the announcement in a statement released at the
Solidarity trade union headquarters in Gdansk on Thursday.
   ``The Nobel Prize I received in 1983 was at the same time a
prize for the whole movement of reforms called Solidarity. The
desire to give the prize money for a most worthy purpose held me
back against a hasty decision,'' Walesa said.
   ``Today, the fact that Solidarity has taken over responsibility
for the country in such a difficult period for society makes me
donate the sum of $200,000 to the National Gift Fund,'' he said.
   Reviving a pre-war tradition of appealing to the nation for
help, the National Assembly approved the creation of a National
Gift Fund in early December.
   People may donate anything from cash to jewelry to the fund,
which will be used to help the country and citizens who face
financial problems as the country moves toward a market-oriented
economy.
   Last year was one of triumph for Solidarity, the independent
trade union movement founded more than nine years ago in Gdansk.
   Solidarity swept to victory in prarliamentary elections in June.
Walesa's adviser, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, was elected in August to be
the East bloc's first non-Communist prime minister.
   Despite its political victories, the Solidarity-led government
faces a major challenge in introducing market-oriented economic
reforms that are almost sure to leave Poles worse off in the short
run.

   Thousands of Bulgaria's majority Slavs
walked off their jobs today in at least five cities to protest a
new policy restoring Moslem names and religious rights to ethnic
Turks.
   Bulgarian radio said the protests paralyzed the southern city of
Kardzhali and caused disruptions in the other cities, Bulgarian
radio reported.
   The radio said thousands of workers from all enterprises went on
strike in Kardzhali, and public transportation was halted. Strikes
and mass protests also took place today in Plovdiv, Bulgaria's
second largest city, as well as in the northern cities of Ruse,
Razgrad and Silistra.
   The report described the situation as particularly tense in
Kardzhali, in which nearly half of the 50,000 residents are ethnic
Turks.
   Petar Mladenov, the Communist Party chief and president, was
expected to arrive in Kardzhali to assess the nationalistic
protests.
   The Bulgarian Communist leadership adopted a policy on Dec. 29
that allows Bulgarian Turks to use their Moslem names. The policy
reversed measures in effect under the ousted hard-line Communist
leader Todor Zhivkov in which Moslems were given Slav names and
their religious rites were restricted.
   Addressing thousands of demonstrators in Plovdiv, Pantalei
Pachov, a member of the Politburo and the city's first party
secretary, said the Central Committee decision allowing free choice
of names had been ``premature,'' assured the protesters that the
measure would be reconsidered.
   ``The Turkish-speaking citizens demand their own schools, they
do not raise Bulgarian flags at their demonstrations. They have
rejected our stretched-out hand,'' Pachov said.
   Thousands of people demonstrated in front of Parliament in Sofia
on Thursday, demanding a national referendum on the ethnic
question. Protests also took place in Kardzhali and several other
cities.
   Bulgarian newspapers today carried a joint statement issued by
the ruling Communist Party and the opposition expressing ``full
support'' for the Dec. 29 decision regarding ethnic rights.
   The state news agency BTA reported spokesmen for the Communist
Party and the democratic opposition as rejecting a proposed
referendum on the ethnic decision, saying: ``The validity of human
rights in Bulgaria cannot be submitted to any referendum.''
   About 320,000 Turks fled this summer when Zhivkov permitted them
to get passports. Nearly all of them complained about persecution
and the denial of essential religious and ethnic rights. The exodus
ended when Turkey, unable to take more immigrants, closed their
borders.
   About 1.5 million of Bulgaria's 9 million people are Moslem.
Nationalists have doubted the loyalties of the Bulgarian Turks
since Bulgaria declared independence from the Ottoman Empire, which
had ruled it for 500 years.
   Zhivkov was ousted Nov. 10 amid a wave of democratic reforms
that have swept Eastern Europe. Mladenov, considered more moderate,
took over and promised free elections and dismantled secret police
units.
   Parliament is expected to pave the way for a pluralistic
political system Jan. 15 when it votes on removing a constitutional
clause guaranteeing the Communist Party's hold on power Bulgaria.

   The Vatican embassy pressured Manuel
Noriega to surrender to U.S. troops by threatening to ask
Panamanian authorities to come in after the ``highly dangerous
criminal,'' a spokesman said.
   ``We would have lifted the diplomatic immunity,'' said the Rev.
Javier Villanueva, assisant to the papal nuncio.
   He made the disclosure Thursday as Panamanians assessed the cost
of the two-year struggle over Noriega's ouster, which was completed
Wednesday when he left the Vatican embassy and was whisked off by
U.S. troops to Florida to face federal drug-trafficking charges.
   Noriega's arrest led to festive street celebrations, but
Panamanians must now face an economy battered in large part by the
invasion and by U.S. sanctions aimed at toppling Noriega.
   Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, commander of U.S. Army South, said
there was no remaining fighting or guerrilla activity on Thursday.
   ``The whole country is pretty well pacified,'' Cisneros said. He
said all 16,000 members of Noriega's Defense Forces had been
accounted for, but he did not say where they were.
   Villanueva said embassy officials didn't give Noriega a deadline
to leave, but made his choices clear.
   ``If he would not have given himself up, the Panamanian
government, not the U.S. government, would have been invited to
send in forces to take him out,'' Villanueva said in a telephone
interview.
   In Washington, however, a senior Bush adminstration official
said the papal nuncio, Monsignor Sebastian Laboa, gave Noriega a
Thursday noon deadline to get out, ``meaning he would no longer be
a welcome guest.''
   U.S. troops had ringed the mission since Noriega took refuge
there on Christmas Eve, four days after the American invasion
crushed his military regime and installed a civilian government.
   Cisneros said Noriega kept a machine gun under his bed during
his entire 10-day stay at the mission, which would have made it
difficult for embassy staff to remove him forcibly.
   Villanueva said the lifting of diplomatic immunity would not
have been considered if Noriega had been a political prisoner.
   ``But this man is a highly dangerous criminal,'' he said.
   Noriega claimed he was a political prisoner in refusing to enter
a plea to drug-trafficking charges in Miami. The judge entered an
innocent plea for him and he was held without bond.
   Cisneros said Noriega showed no emotion when he left the Vatican
mission.
   ``When he walked out of the nunciatura, he was normal. In other
words, he wasn't strutting or ... defeated. He was just walking
expressionless,'' he said.
   Today's editions of the Washington Times said that once he was
aboard the Florida-bound military transport plane, Noriega began to
cry and told U.S. drug agents he had ``really put my foot in it
this time.''
   ``He carried a Bible in one hand and three Catholic rosaries in
another when they brought him to the plane,'' the Times quoted a
source familiar with the flight as saying. ``He was very depressed,
although tranquil. One agent read him sriptures from the Bible in
Spanish during the flight.''
   The source, who was not identified, said Noriega told the agents
he had chosen to surrender but now believed he may have made a
mistake.
   A top Noriega adviser and head of his secret police, Lt. Col.
Nivaldo Madrinan, walked out of the mission on Thursday and
surrendered to U.S. troops.
   The new government of President Guillermo Endara preferred to
have Noriega go directly into U.S. hands.
   Endara has said Panama has no prison secure enough to hold him
and the judicial system was inadequate to prosecute him. Also,
several Panamanian officials have said there was no law that would
allow his extradition.
   Endara said his government's priorities are:
   _ Reconstruction of Chorrillo, the low-income neighborhood
around the Defense Forces headquarters that was destroyed in the
U.S. invasion.
   _ Organization of a security force.
   _ To ``make sure the military occupation is as brief as
possible.''
   _ Reconstruction of the economy, ``which has suffered so much.''
   Panama's economy once flourished on international banking and
trade, but it skidded to a near-halt after the United States began
imposing sanctions nearly two years ago to press for Noriega's
ouster as chief of the Defense Forces.

<HEAD>Increased Crash Protection Proposed For Vans, Light Trucks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Light trucks and vans would have the same
crash protection devices as those required for passenger cars under
a proposed federal regulation.
   ``The installation of air bags or automatic safety belts in the
front seat of these vehicles could save as many as 2,000 lives a
year,'' said Jerry R. Curry, administrator of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration.
   The agency said Thursday that it would phase in the new
requirement over three years as it did with the rule on crash
protection for cars.
   Under the regulation, 20 percent of the vans, light trucks,
multipurpose passenger vehicles and small buses manufactured in the
1994 model year would be required to provide the bags or automatic
safety belts.
   The safety features would be required on 50 percent of the 1995
model vehicles and on all of those manufactured in 1996.
   Under the rule, vehicles that offer a driver's side air bag
could have a manual safety belt on the passenger side and still
comply with the agency's standard through the 1997 model year. But
manufacturers that don't provide a driver's side air bag would have
to install automatic belts for the driver and on the front-seat
passenger side.
   ``We are encouraging air bags as the technology of choice
because air bags in combination with existing lap and shoulder
belts offer the best protection available,'' Curry said.
   All new passenger cars sold in the United States now must have
air bags or automatic belts.
   ``They are saving thousands of lives and preventing tens of
thousands of serious injuries each year,'' Curry said. ``The same
protection should be given to those who choose to buy today's
popular minivans and light trucks.''
   Deaths and injuries to light truck riders increased from 6,500
in 1984 to 8,300 in 1988, he said. Number of the vehicles sold also
have increased.
   The agency's move drew praise from Sen. Jack Danforth, R-Mo.,
ranking Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee and a longtime
air bag proponent.
   ``Air bag technology has been around since the early 1960s, but
only this year did we see large numbers of cars with air bags,''
Danforth said. ``We should not go through another long struggle to
get air bags into the vehicles now used frequently by families.''
   The rule would apply to all vans, trucks, buses and multipurpose
vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 8,500 pounds and an
unloaded vehicle weight of 5,500 pounds or less.
   Included would be motor homes, convertibles, open-body-type
vehicles, walk-in van-type trucks and vehicles carrying
chassis-mounted campers.
   Also under the rule, light trucks and passenger cars with only
two seating positions would have to be equipped to support a child
safety seat on the passenger side.
   The announcement opens a 60-day period for public comment on the
proposed rule. Afterward, the agency will write a final version and
set a date for implementing it.

   State governments are keeping up a decade-long
trend of substantially increasing spending on education, the Census
Bureau says.
   States spent nearly $160 billion, or 33 percent of their
revenues, on education in 1988, the bureau reported Thursday. Most
of the money went to local governments or higher education
institutions, the report said.
   That spending was 6.4 percent more than what the states gave to
education in 1987, the report said. Since 1978, states' education
spending has increased at an average annual rate of 8.6 percent,
the bureau said, while overall state spending has increased by an
average of 9.1 percent.
   Healthy education increases are probably due, in part, to a
trend by states to funnel funds to education reforms, said
Education Department budget chief Charlie Kolb.
   ``There's been a sense for the last seven or eight years that
we're not doing as well as we could have,'' Kolb said. ``We're
outspending the rest of the world but we're not outperforming.''
   Kolb said education spending at all levels _ federal, state and
local _ increased from $331 billion in fiscal 1989 to $353 billion
in fiscal 1990.
   The Census Bureau's report said about 17 percent, or $84
billion, of state funds in 1988 went toward public welfare
programs, a 7.4 percent increase over the previous year.
   Private vendors received $44 billion for services they provided
to the needy while direct cash payments to welfare recipients
totaled $11 billion, the report said.
   Big-ticket expenditures by states included $44 billion on
insurance funds such as workers compensation, $41 billion on
highways and $35 billion on health and hospitals.
   In all, states spent $485 billion on programs while revenues
climbed 4.8 percent to $542 billion. Taxes accounted for $264
billion, or 49 percent of all revenue, while federal payments
totaled $100 billion, or 18 percent.
   Per capita revenue for all state governments averaged $2,209,
down slightly from the previous year. Alaska was highest at
$10,671, followed by Wyoming with $3,531. The lowest were Texas, at
$1,583, and Florida, at $1,570.
   More than half of all revenues were collected by just nine
states, the report said. Those states, followed with the amounts in
billions, are:
   California, $73.2; New York, $57.3; Ohio, $25.6; Texas, $26.7;
Pennsylvania, $23.8; Michigan, $21.5; New Jersey, $21; Illinois,
$20.5; and Florida, $19.4.

   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured
goods rose 2.4 percent in November, pumped up by durable goods to
the second highest level ever, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $239.7
billion after edging down 0.1 percent in October.
   It was the highest level of orders since a record $239.9 billion
were posted last April and the fastest rate of increase since a 2.8
percent advance in August.
   The department said all of the November improvement was in
orders for durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last more
than three years.
   All of the major durable categories recorded increased sales.
   The report was one of several recently portraying a mixed
picture of the extent of sluggishness in the economy, particularly
in housing and the durable-goods manufacturing sector.
   Improvements have been reported in November, for instance, in
sales of new and existing houses and of durable goods, and
industrial production advanced 0.1 percent.
   But the Labor Department reported today that the manufacturing
sector lost 25,000 jobs in December, bringing job losses in this
area to 195,000 since last March.
   Today's reports follow falling interest rates, which the Federal
Reserve had earlier boosted to slow the economy and restrain
inflation. As inflation moderated and concerns grew that the
economy might fall into a recession, the central bank has gradually
eased its grip on credit.
   Many analysts continue to express concern over the economy,
however, and want the Fed to permit interest rates to fall further
to stimulate economic activity.
   In addition to new orders, the Commerce Department said
shipments of manufactured goods rose 0.5 percent to $233.1 billion,
while inventories rose 0.3 percent to $373.0 billion.
   If inventories increase without a corresponding gain in new
orders, it could signal production cutbacks in the future as
factories attempt to get rid of goods on shelves and backlots.
   Orders for durable goods gained 4.8 percent to $130.2 billion.
   Transportation equipment increased 10.6 percent to $36.7
billion. This included increases of $2.6 billion for aircraft and
$1.5 billion for automobiles.
   Excluding the transportation sector, orders would have posted
only a 1.1 percent gain.
   Electrical machinery orders were up 7.7 percent to $21.7
billion, while non-electrical machinery gained 5.7 percent to $22.7
billion. Primary metals advanced 2.2 percent to $11.3 billion.
   Orders for non-durable goods declined 0.3 percent to $109.5
billion.
   Defense orders fell 10 percent to $16.9 billion. Excluding this
category, orders would have risen 1.8 percent.
   In the key category of non-defense capital goods, a barometer of
business investment plans, orders jumped 7.7 percent.

   Manuel Noriega's tumble from dictator to defendant
ended in the tight security of a U.S. courtroom as the once-fiery
Panamanian ruler quietly faced a federal judge.
   In a soft voice, a humbled Noriega answered U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler's initial inquiries. But he declined to reply to
drug trafficking charges at the brief hearing Thursday, less than a
month after saying he would never surrender to the United States.
   The judge entered an innocent plea for Noriega, who appeared in
court in a Panamanian Defense Force uniform.
   Noriega, federal prisoner No. 41586, was being held early today
in an undisclosed Miami-area location, his attorneys said.
   Defense attorneys say it could be nine months before they can go
to trial on charges that Noriega took $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to turn his nation into a way
station for the cocaine trade.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said he thought the trial would
take only two months; defense attorneys said it could go on for six
months.
   Defense attorney Frank Rubino said Noriega ``appeared to be
strong. He appeared to be confident. We went over the facts. ... He
was extremely confident in assisting us.''
   U.S. drug agents who accompanied Noriega on his flight from
Panama to Miami gave a markedly different description, saying he
was in tears aboard the transport plane and regretted leaving the
papal nunciature, The Washington Times reported today.
   ``I really put my foot in it this time,'' Noriega was quoted as
saying. ``I should not have left the nunciature.''
   A source familiar with the flight said Noriega carried a Bible
in one hand and three rosaries in another when he was brought to
the plane.
   ``He was very depressed, although tranquil. One agent read him
scriptures from the Bible in Spanish during the flight,'' the
unidentified source told the newspaper.
   If convicted of all charges, Noriega, 51, could be sentenced to
145 years in prison and fined $1.1 million.
   Rubino said he planned to file motions to dismiss the case,
claiming the charges are politically motivated and questioning the
methods used late Wednesday to remove Noriega from the Vatican
Embassy in Panama City, where he was sheltered in a room for 10
days under diplomatic protection.
   ``General Noriega refuses to submit to the jurisdiction of this
court ... because he is a political prisoner brought to this
country illegally,'' Rubino told Hoeveler.
   Other defense claims will say the U.S. invasion violated
Panama's sovereignty and international treaties, and that Noriega
is a chief of state and subject to immunity, Rubino said.
   But last year, Hoeveler ruled that the United States has
jurisdiction in the case because the State Department never
recognized Noriega's political legitimacy.
   Rubino said the Panamanian general surrendered following
statements that Panama would revoke the diplomatic status of the
papal nuncio, and because the embassy was surrounded by angry
crowds and U.S. soldiers.
   Vatican officials, however, said Noriega left voluntarily. In
Washington, a senior Bush administration official said the Vatican
planned to order Noriega to leave by noon Thursday.
   Rubino said he will likely request a bond hearing within 30
days. The judge ordered Noriega held without bond.
   Tom Cash, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration in Miami,
said Noriega's capture was only one benchmark in the nation's drug
war.
   ``We're not going to open cases of champagne. We'll take it one
glass at a time,'' he said.
   Noriega walked into the downtown courtroom without handcuffs or
shackles. Each time Hoeveler asked a question, he rose and removed
his headphones used for translation. He answered softly in Spanish
and stared at the judge, showing no emotion.
   Noriega and 15 others were indicted in February 1988 by a
federal grand jury in Miami. Noriega also faces charges in Tampa.
   Bush administration sources said Noriega was assured he would
not be tried under a statute that carries the death penalty for
drug-related killings.
   Five other defendants in the indictment have appeared in court
in Miami. Noriega's whereabouts today were a losely guarded secret.
   ``We will only say that he is in a secure facility,'' said
Justice Department spokesman Daniel Eramian in Washington.
   Although officials refused to divulge details of security
measures, they acknowleged precautions were stepped up.
   ``The security taken is in line for such a high-visibility
defendant,'' said U.S. Marshals agent Darrell William.
   Noriega landed early Thursday at Homestead Air Force Base south
of Miami and immediately was taken to a basement holding cell at
the federal courthouse.
   Outside, Panamanian exiles celebrated Noriega's capture and
scuffled briefly with a protester opposing the U.S. invasion.
   Two airplanes flew overhead with banners saying ``Bye Bye,
Tony'' and ``Rent This Ad When Fidel Falls,'' showing
Cuban-American solidarity with Panamanians.
   Among the witnesses expected to testify against Noriega are Jose
Blandon, the former Panamanian consul in New York, and several
co-defendants.
   ``The informants will fall like pineapples from a tree now that
Noriega is in custody,'' said Richard Sharpstein, attorney for
co-defendant Brian Alden Davidow.

<HEAD>Female Cabinet Minister Drops Challenge to Sumo Tradition</HEAD>

   Tradition won over women's rights today, as Japan's
chief government spokeswoman abandoned her challenge to an ancient
taboo that bans women from entering the sumo ring.
   The battle began in December, when Chief Cabinet Secretary
Mayumi Moriyama informed the Japan Sumo Association that she
intended to present the Prime Minister's Cup to the winner of the
New Year Grand Sumo Tournament from inside the ring.
   The Prime Minister's Cup since 1978 has been presented by the
deputy chief Cabinet secretary to the winner of the annual 15-day
New Year's tournament, which begins Sunday.
   But Mrs. Moriyama, who last year became the first woman to hold
the important Cabinet post, asked to present the award herself to
challenge a tradition that forbids women from entering the ring, a
raised mound of clay about 14 feet in diameter.
   ``What Mrs. Moriyama meant to do was to raise the issue to
improve women's social position,'' the deputy Cabinet secretary,
Nobuo Ishihara, told reporters Friday. But after sumo officials
stated their opposition, she decided not to push the issue further,
Ishihara said.
   Futagoyama, the chairman of the sumo association, told reporters
today that ``I don't know how things will change in the future, but
I appreciate (her) understanding.'' On Thursday, the former
wrestler had said the ring ``is sacred and we must preserve our
traditions.''
   It was not until 1778 that women were allowed to watch bouts _
but only on the final day of tournaments.
   A century later, women were allowed to watch throughout
tournaments, but not permitted to go up on the ring, a tradition
which remains the same to this day, even though the 2,000-year-old
sport has gained many female fans.
   At Ryogoku national gymnasium in Tokyo, which opened in 1909,
women were banned from the first five rows around the ring until
after World War II, said Lora Sharnoff in her recently published
book, ``Grand Sumo.''
   ``Although her challenge didn't work this time, things have
changed, and I believe they will also change in the future,'' said
Ryoichi Maki, a secretary to Mrs. Moriyama.
   ``Sumo symbolizes the male-dominated structure of our society,''
said Yoko Morosawa, a researcher on women's issues. ``I'm glad Mrs.
Moriyama did this. Although she won't be able to climb into the
ring, her action definitely contributed to making more people
realize the problem.''

<HEAD>N.J.-Pa. Hospitals Asked to Cancel Elective Surgery Due to Blood
Shortage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The regional American Red Cross is asking
hospitals in southeastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey to
cancel all elective surgery because of a critically low supply of
blood.
   The request was to go to 93 hospitals in the region, said Susan
Snyder, a spokeswoman for the Penn-Jersey region of American Red
Cross Blood Services.
   The hospitals ``will all be advised that we can't support
elective surgeries,'' she said Thursday.
   In Georgia, four Atlanta-area hospitals also canceled elective
surgeries because of low blood supplies.
   Elective surgery includes operations that may be necessary to a
patient's health but not those needed to save a life.
   Ms. Snyder said surgeries have been canceled previously because
of blood shortages, ``but there haven't been cancellations this
severe, such extensive and planned cancellation of elective surgery
in at least 10 years.''
   The request came on the second day of an emergency appeal for
blood donors as the Red Cross said it fell 4,500 units short during
December and had virtually no blood available of types O negative
and B negative.
   Donation levels typically drop during the holiday season, but
they were reduced even further when the unusually cold December
kept people from going to donation centers, the Red Cross said.
   The Red Cross, which provides 94 percent of the blood used in
the 93 hospitals, needs about 1,750 donors a day and was down to
about 1,000 last month.
   Donors increased to 1,347 Wednesday and more callers were
seeking information Thursday, the Red Cross said.
   ``The initial response we are seeing is very gratifying,'' said
Dr. William C. Sherwood, director of the Penn-Jersey region.
   In Atlanta, surgeries were delayed for a pregnant woman needing
abdominal surgery, a man awaiting open-heart surgery, a patient
waiting for a liver transplant, and a patient with a bleeding
ulcer, Anne Willcox, a Red Cross representative, said Thursday.
   After an appeal for donations, about 1,300 people donated blood
Wednesday, Red Cross officials said, but that response was not
matched Thursday.
   The Red Cross normally needs 900 units of blood a day to meet
the demands of the more than 100 hospitals in the 82-county Atlanta
region, but donations dropped as low as 300 units a day over the
holidays, said Beth V. Greenberg, administrative director of Red
Cross Donor Services.

<HEAD>Four Killed in Shiite Battles; President Planning Move to West
Beirut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RIMA SALAMEAH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias battled with
machine guns, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades today in south
Lebanon, killing four people and wounding 12, including three PLO
guerrillas sent in to quell the violence, police said.
   President Elias Hrawi, meanwhile, planned to set up his office
and residence in a west Beirut building to avoid the risks of
commuting in the Moslem area, where his predecessor was killed by a
car bomb.
   Fighters of the Syrian-backed Amal and pro-Iranian Hezbollah
militias fought in south Lebanon's Apple Province as they continued
their more than 2-year-old war for mastery of Lebanon's 1.2 million
Shiites.
   A police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line
with regulations, said the wounded Palestinians were caught in
cross-fire as Amal repulsed two thrusts by Hezbollah fighters in
the village of Kfar Hatta.
   The Palestinians, from the mainline Fatah faction of the PLO,
are based between the Amal-held Kfar Hatta and the neighboring
village of Kfar Milki, which is controlled by Hezbollah. They were
part of a 300-member force deployed over the weekend to quell the
militia fighting, the police spokesman said.
   The casualties today raised the overall toll to 77 killed and
275 wounded since the latest militia fighting began Dec. 23.
   Hrawi had been staying at an army barracks in east Lebanon's
Bekaa valley since his election Nov. 24. The police spokesman said
he was expected to move to west Beirut as soon as security
arrangements were made.
   Hrawi planned to set up a residence and office in a seaside
apartment building where his predeccesor, Rene Mouawad, lived.
Mouawad's office was a 10-minute drive away, and he was killed by a
car bomb Nov. 22 as he drove home from the office.
   ``The president will not leave the building unless on foreign
trips,'' a government sources said of Hrawi. He spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``We want to avoid risks.''
   The presidential palace in Beirut's suburb of Baabda is the
traditional seat of a head of state, but the Christian leader, Gen.
Michel Aoun, refuses to leave the compound.
   Aoun rejected Hrawi's election, which came about as a result of
an Arab League-sponsored plan aimed at ending 14 years of civil
war. Aoun opposed the plan because it did not include a deadline
for the withdrawal of Syria's 40,000 troops from Lebanon, and he
denounced Hrawi as a Syrian puppet.
   Hrawi dismissed Aoun as the army leader, but Aoun continues to
command 20,000 loyal troops controlling Lebanon's Christian enclave.
   France said today it had received a request from Lebanese Prime
Minister Selim Hoss to freeze all French bank accounts belonging to
Aoun.
   A French Foreign Ministry spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, refused to discuss what the government might do in
response.
   The French satirical and investigative weekly Le Canard Enchaine
published a reproduction of a bank statement showing two accounts
in Aoun's name at the Banque Nationale de Paris, one with $500,000
and the other with $14.7 million.
   In a radio interview Thursday, Aoun said the money came from
donations by Lebanese supporters and was used to support his
military effort.
   Syria's chief ally in Lebanon, Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt,
alleged in an interview published today in Lebanon that PLO chief
Yasser Arafat donated the money in hopes of regaining the PLO's
foothold in Beirut.
   The PLO was driven out of Beirut during Israel's 1982 invasion
of Lebanon.

   A worn-out cable caused a blackout at City
Airport, forcing officials to close the airport and divert at least
two flights to the much-larger Detroit Metropolitan Airport.
   One of the planes, Southwest Flight 993 from Chicago, banked
away from its landing when the runway and other lights flickered
out about 10:45 p.m. Thursday, said passenger Bruce Babiarz.
   The airport temporarily had no radio, no communications and no
navigational equipment, Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman
Martha Vercammen said.
   Generators were started up for the control tower but didn't have
enough power to light the runway, forcing the airport to shut down
until daylight, said George Cascos, deputy superintendent of the
city Public Lighting Department.
   He said 300 feet of underground cable were being replaced today
and that the lights were expected to be working again this
afternoon.
   Babiarz said the pilot came on the intercom and said, ``I
suppose you're all wondering why we didn't land.''
   The plane circled for about 15 minutes. The pilot then announced
that the airport was having major power problems and the flight
would land at Metropolitan airport, about 30 miles southwest.
   Later, Southwest Flight 506 from Chicago, scheduled to arrive at
11:45 p.m., was also diverted to Detroit Metro. Both planes landed
without incident and passengers were bused to City Airport.

   A woman turned in by her 8-year-old daughter
was sentenced to six months in jail for possessing cocaine for sale.
   Superior Court Judge Kathryne Stoltz on Thursday also sentenced
Carmen Garcia to three years of probation.
   After attending a drug-education program, Garcia's daughter,
whose name was withheld, brought a suspicious bag of white powder
to her teacher at her North Hollywood elementary school, police
said.
   A laboratory test determined the powder was cocaine and police
got a search warrant for Garcia's home that afternoon.
   Police arrested Garcia, 31, in October after they searched her
home and discovered 14 other packets of cocaine.
   The girl was sent to live with her father at a separate home.

   The forecful editorial voice of Panama's La Prensa
newspaper will be heard again Sunday for the first time in nearly
two years if its exiled publisher can ``patch it together'' in time.
   ``We are running around like chickens with our heads cut off
buying computer parts and so forth and hoping to get our first
edition out on the streets by Sunday morning,'' Roberto Eisenmann
Jr. said Thursday.
   Eisenmann, who has worked as a Miami bank executive while in
exile, planned to travel to Panama City today in the absence of
ousted leader Gen. Manuel Noriega. Pro-Noriega forces repeatedly
shut down the presses of Panama's leading independent newspaper,
the last time in February 1988.
   After receiving a dire report on conditions at the newspaper
office, Eisenmann said, ``I don't know how we're going to do it
with 95 percent destruction, but we're going to do it.''
   Staff members returned to the newspaper plant on Christmas Day
for the first time since the closure.
   ``The team came together immediately, and everybody's been
working around the clock cannibalizing all the equipment to make
one computer out of three,'' he said. ``We're going to patch it
together with Band-Aids and be on the streets.''
   Eisenmann, whose voice had been a thorn in the side of Noriega,
said he had ``absolutely no problem'' with U.S. prosecution of
Noriega on drug charges.
   ``Panama at this point has no capability. The judiciary system
is not yet organized,'' he said. ``There isn't even a secure jail
in the country at this point.''
   The publisher said he expected Noriega to be returned to Panama
for prosecution on human-rights abuses after the U.S. trial.
   Meanwhile, Eisenmann's time was occupied with ordering computer
parts and preparing to fly home.
   ``When you're in exile, you live for the return,'' he said.
``Everybody that I know is packing bags and getting ready to go
back.''

<HEAD>Japan Considering Aid Package, Envoy Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese government is considering an aid
package to help Panama recover from the ravages caused by the U.S.
military invasion, Japan's ambassador said in a meeting with Vice
President Dan Quayle today.
   Quayle, at the start of the meeting with Ambassador Ryohei
Murata, also announced that Japan has decided to formally recognize
the U.S.-installed government of Guillermo Endara in Panama.
   Japan joins a handful of other nations that officially
recognized the new government in the wake of the U.S. invasion that
drove dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega from power last month.
   Bush administration officials have said they would like Japan
and other nations to help boost Panama's economy and provide aid to
compensate for the invasion-related destruction as well as the
economic damage resulting from U.S. economic sanctions against the
Noriega regime.
   Asked if Japan would provide such aid, Murata said he planned to
``discuss some of those things'' in the meeting with Quayle.
   Estimates range as high as $2 billion in damage to Panama's
economy from the invasion. Entire neighborhoods were destroyed by
bombing and fighting, and the central business district suffered
heavy damage and looting.
   When the United States was exerting pressure on its friends
around the world to break with Noriega in 1988, Japan was slow to
respond, making its action now significant for the administration.
   Asked if Japan supported President Bush's decision to invade
Panama, Murata declined to answer directly.
   ``We understand the background against which the U.S. decided to
take that action,'' he said.
   Quayle said he hoped Japan's early recognition of the Endara
government would encourage other nations to follow suit.
   ``This is another positive development in the Endara government
establishing its credibility, not just in this hemisphere but
around the world,'' Quayle said.

   Striking coal miners say they are eager to
end a nine-month strike but won't decide about getting back to work
until they get their hands on the tentative contract.
   ``We're not popping the champagne corks yet,'' Everett Street
said Thursday at a United Mine Workers camp in Logan County.
   The union and Pittston Coal Group officials on Monday announced
an agreement that would end a strike that has idled the company
since April 5. Street said he needs to get a close look at the
proposed pact.
   ``We don't have a contract yet and we aren't going back until we
have one,'' he said. ``We vote next week to ratify it. If it
passes, we go back. If it doesn't, we'll stay out here for another
nine months.''
   Copies of the contract have yet to be distributed to the 1,700
Pittston employees who struck in West Virginia, Virginia and
Kentucky, and on Thursday the document still was being drafted.
Miners waiting at Camp Solidarity II southwest of Logan were told
to expect copies on Monday, said a UMW District 17 spokeswoman who
declined identification.
   ``More and more people are just hanging around the camp, sitting
and waiting,'' said Roger Nelson, an unemployed coal miner who
helps run the camp.
   ``There are about 40, 45, 50 people here _ more than on an
average day,'' he said Thursday. ``They're discussing it, and
they're all optimistic about getting back to work.''
   Neither the union nor Pittston has released details of the
contract proposal. But neither side is denying published accounts
that say Pittston and the UMW would pay into a separate trust fund
for pensioners and that health benefits for retirees would be paid
at 100 percent, except for some doctor visits and prescription
drugs.
   The agreement also is contingent upon $65 million in fines
against the union for strike violence being dropped. National Labor
Relations Board charges against both sides also would be dropped.
   ``As of yet we don't have a schedule for ratification,'' UMW
spokeswoman Kirsti Smith said Thursday. ``We still have to get hold
of the trustees and courts and NLRB. As soon as we have a schedule
we'll make it public.''
   At Pittston operations in Virginia, replacement employees
continued at work pending ratification. Company spokeswoman Susan
Copeland said Thursday it wasn't clear what would happen to the
replacement workers when, or if, the union miners return.
   The use of replacement workers led to violence, and at one point
more than 46,000 miners in 10 states staged a wildcat sympathy
strike fearing a Pittston victory would encourage other companies
to fight the union.

<TEXT>
   Fighting between Liberian forces and
rebels opposed to President Samuel K. Doe has destroyed two towns
in northeastern Liberia and sent thousands fleeing across the
border, Western diplomats said today.
   The fighting began nearly two weeks ago in eastern Nimba County,
where Doe said two groups of rebels entered Dec. 24 from
neighboring Ivory Coast.
   One of the groups killed a police sergeant at the border town of
Butuo before government forces ``arrested the situation,'' while
the other group reached the capital, Monrovia, but abandoned their
weapons and surrendered, Doe said Tuesday.
   A Western diplomat contacted by telephone in Monrovia said today
he understood most of the dissidents had been killed, captured or
fled.
   Diplomats, who refused to be identified, said it was difficult
to determine the exact number of Liberians fleeing the hostilities
because the border area is heavily forested and communications are
poor.
   ``People are trying to get out of the contested area,'' one
said. ``The number, however, is anyone's guess.''
   Emmanuel Bowier, Liberia's information minister, refused to
discuss the situation when contacted today by The Associated Press.
   Doe said Thursday that the situation in Nimba County was
returning to normal and invited journalists to visit the area, but
``at their own risk as military operations were continuing.''
   The Liberian News Agency reported today that Doe himself was
going to the area, which is under a dusk-to-dawn curfew.
   The diplomats said it could take awhile for the government to
dislodge all the dissidents in the sparsely populated region 100
miles northeast of Monrovia.
   One diplomat said the towns of Kahntle and Butuo were destroyed
in the fighting.
   Justice Minister Jenkin Scott said Tuesday the invaders numbered
96 and they had been trained in Burkina Faso and Libya.
   Ivory Coast repeatedly has denied Liberia's charges it harbors
Doe's opponents. Burkina Faso also denied any role in the invasion.
   The dissidents are led by Charles Taylor, a former civil servant
in Doe's government. They call themselves the National Patriotic
Front and appear to have no connection with Liberia's opposition
parties, said a diplomat.
   Doe is a former sergeant major in Liberia's army. He came to
power in a bloody coup in April 1980 in which President William
Tolbert, a descendant of freed American slaves, and most of his
political allies were killed.
   Doe himself has withstood several alleged plots.

   A reputed member of the Gambino crime family has
been accused of supervising a ``joint venture'' of American and
Italian organized crime groups to import heroin into the United
States.
   An indictment unsealed Thursday charges John Gambino with
conspiracy to import and distribute heroin and cocaine from 1978 to
1988, distribution of heroin and racketeering. He was arrested
outside his home Wednesday and a bail hearing was scheduled today.
   Gambino was added as a defendant in a pending federal indictment
that had already charged his brother, Giuseppe, and 14 other men.
The other defendants, first charged in December 1988, are scheduled
for trial in April.
   The Pennsylvania Crime Commission says Gambino is a cousin of
Carlo Gambino, the nation's top Mafia boss at the time of his death
in 1976. Authorities say the Gambino crime family is now headed by
John Gotti.
   FBI spokesman Joseph Valiquette said the suspect was the same
John Gambino who was described in 1983 as a captain in the Gambino
crime family's southern New Jersey unit.
   A New Jersey state police report on organized crime said Gambino
was involved ``in heroin trafficking and was recently (February
1982) indicted in Italy on counts of conspiracy to import drugs
into Italy, manufacture heroin and import it into the United
States.''
   The Pennsylvania Crime Commission has reported that he was
deported in 1958 as an illegal alien, but returned to the United
States, married a cousin, and settled in New York.
   The indictment said John Gambino, identified as Giovanni in the
indictment, and his brother were in charge of a Gambino family crew
that operated out of a cafe in Brooklyn.
   ``Since at least 1978, the Sicilian and American branches of the
Mafia conducted a joint venture to import multiple kilogram
quantities of heroin into the United States through Giovanni
Gambino and his subordinates in New York,'' the indictment said.
   As an example, the indictment said Gambino and his crew
allegedly received more than 500 kilograms _ 1,100 pounds _ of
heroin from the Sicilian Mafia between late 1978 and mid-1979.
   Gambino's attorney, Robert Ellis, opposed his client's
detention, saying he had serious health problems that date back to
a stroke in 1985 and open heart surgery in 1987. Ellis said Gambino
works in the construction industry.
   If convicted of the charges, Gambino could be sentenced to life
in prison and fined millions of dollars.
   According to the Pennsylvania Crime Commission, Gambino was one
of several cousins of Carlo Gambino who moved in 1972 to southern
New Jersey, where they established restaurants that allegedly were
used as fronts for drug dealing.
   A younger brother, Rosario Gambino, of Cherry Hill, N.J., was
convicted in 1984 of heading a $200 million-a-year heroin ring and
is serving a 45-year sentence.

<HEAD>Report: Assad To Punish Jibril If Involved In Plane Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian President Hafez Assad promised to punish a
breakaway Palestinian leader if Washington provides proof that he
was involved in the December 1988 bombing of the Pan Am Flight 103,
a newspaper reported today.
   The Kuwaiti daily Al-Qabas said the pledge was made in a letter
Assad recently sent to President Bush in reply to a message on
three regional problems _ terrorism, Lebanon and the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
   The report quoted unidentified ``informed sources'' in the
Syrian capital, Damascus, as saying Assad reiterated in the message
that his country rejects ``all forms of terrorism.''
   A bomb concealed in a radio-cassette player exploded on the New
York-bound plane over Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec. 21, 1988, killing
all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground.
   The bomber has not been identified, but suspicion has falled on
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command,
led by Ahmed Jibril, a former Syrian army captain.
   Jibril's group has been blamed for a series of terrorist attacks
since it broke away from the mainstream Palestinian faction, Fatah,
which is led by Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser
Arafat.
   According to Al-Qabas, Bush told Assad: ``Washington has
evidence that the operation was planned in Syria and that some of
those who carried it out came from Syrian territory.'' The report
said Bush asked Assad to help arrest the terrorists so they can be
tried in the United States.
   Al-Qabas said: ``Damascus asked Washington to send the evidence
that proves Jibril's involvement, expressing readiness to punish
all those who turn out to be guilty.''

<HEAD>Survivor of Boat Accident Recalls Deaths of Other Boaters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lone U.S. survivor of a chartered scuba
diving boat that sank in chilly Gulf of California waters says a
wetsuit helped save his life as others clutching the same piece of
wreckage lost their grip.
   ``I saw them die,'' Opha Watson said in an interview published
today in the Los Angeles Times. ``It took hours, but they had to
give up. The cold water just saps your energy. Without my wetsuit,
I wouldn't be here today.''
   ``Honestly, I began to believe that I wouldn't make it through
the night,'' said Watson, a 62-year-old retired engineer, speaking
from his Tucson, Ariz., home on Thursday.
   He was one of two men who survived the wreck of the Santa
Barbara, a converted 68-foot fishing boat on a scuba diving
expedition. Fourteen others are still missing after the ship went
down early New Year's Day in the Gulf of California, about 25 miles
west of the Mexican port of Guaymas.
   The Silent Experience Scuba Center and Caiman Expeditions, both
of Tucson, arranged the charter.
   The other survivor, Vicente Gonzalez Mancilla, a 25-year-old
Mexican machinist boat crew member, moved in the chilly waters for
some 35 hours with only a life preserver and some plastic covering
he used for flotation and warmth.
   ``I never stopped moving,'' Gonzalez said Thursday from the
Social Security Hospital in Santa Rosalia, the Baja California town
where he was taken after a passing ferry boat rescued him Tuesday
afternoon.
   Watson was picked up by the private rescue craft Sala del Mar
just before dusk Tuesday.
   Still missing are 10 U.S. citizens, seven from Arizona and three
from California, along with four Mexican crew men.
   As gulf weather conditions worsened Thursday, U.S. and Mexican
officials suspended their search, saying there was little hope of
finding survivors.
   The shipwreck occurred about 3:15 a.m. Monday when extremely
high seas created several huge waves that swamped the vessel, the
survivors said. The boat sank within minutes, before lifeboats
could be launched.

   The $100,000 Hammer Prize for cancer research
will be awarded to Dr. Vincent T. DeVita Jr., former director of
the National Cancer Institute, and Dr. Emil Frei III of Harvard
University.
   The recipients of the 1989 prize were announced Thursday by
Armand Hammer, chairman and chief executive officer of Occidental
Petroleum Corp.
   ``Very many cancer victims, and especially children, owe their
recovery from leukemia and Hodgkin's disease to these dedicated
scientists, who continue to make important contributions to new and
improved cancer therapy,'' Occidental said in a statement.
   DeVita, now physician-in-chief at New York's Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, served as director of the
government's cancer research agency from 1980 to 1988. Frei directs
Harvard's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
   Hammer, a longtime patron of cancer research, said DeVita was
getting the award for pioneering work in developing combinations of
chemotherapy drugs to safely treat and cure cancer, particularly
Hodgkin's disease.
   Frei was cited for developing combinations for chemotherapy
drugs to treat leukemia, and for helping show how such drug
combinations work.
   While the scientists faced initial skepticism about the
effectiveness of combinations of chemotherapy drugs to treat
cancer, ``they persevered to the ultimate benefit of the patients
they treated,'' the Occidental statement said.

<TEXT>
   Ron Kovic, the real-life Vietnam veteran and
anti-war activist portrayed in the movie ``Born on the Fourth of
July,'' is being recruited to run for Congress against conservative
Rep. Robert K. Dornan.
   Kovic, 43, whose autobiography was made into the Tom Cruise film
directed by Oliver Stone, is being wooed by the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, the Los Angeles Times reported
Friday.
   ``We met with Mr. Kovic. We encouraged him to run,'' said Howard
M. Schloss, a spokesman for the committee.
   Kovic declined to return telephone calls seeking comment, but a
longtime friend, political consultant Sid Galanty, said Kovic was
intrigued by the committee's interest.
   ``I think he was very taken by the fact that some of the most
powerful men in the Democratic leadership in the country would want
to meet him and convince him to run for office,'' said Galanty.
   The Republican Dornan, 56, said he would welcome a challenge
from Kovic for his seat representing affluent, conservative Orange
County.
   ``Kovic is going to have to defend the Hollywood far left,''
Dornan said. ``If he thinks he's going to recruit Oliver Stone and
Top-Gun-turned-top-malcontent Tom Cruise, and bring the whole Jane
Fonda team down here to Orange County, I welcome it. Let's go.''
   Though representing both ends of the political spectrum, Kovic
and Dornan both have a flair for attracting attention.
   Kovic, paralyzed from the chest down by a Vietnam war wound,
became a key leader of the anti-war movement after his return home.
   Dornan, nicknamed ``B-1 Bob'' for his strong support of military
projects, is a staunch and blunt-spoken foe of abortion and
homosexual rights.
   The pair also have something in common, according to Dornan.
   During the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami, Dornan
_ then a television producer _ let in Kovic and another disabled
veteran. The two veterans briefly disrupted the proceedings.
   ``I personally wheeled him in,'' Dornan said. ``Against my
better judgment, but he promised he'd be polite.''
   Kovic also appeared three times on a local talk show Dornan was
host of from 1970 to 1973, the lawmaker said.

   A Roman Catholic priest who denied communion
to worshippers who violated his dress code has been asked to leave
his Dayton parish, a spokeswoman for the archdiocese of Cincinnati
said today.
   She would not confirm a published report that the Rev. Roger
Griese had been removed from Sacred Heart Church in Dayton _ an
action he could appeal to the Vatican.
   The Cincinnati Enquirer reported that Archbishop Daniel
Pilarczyk ordered Griese to give up his post effective Wednesday.
   ``He has been asked to leave,'' spokeswoman Rita Reilly said
today.
   Ms. Reilly would not comment further. The Rev. Daniel Conlon,
chancellor of the archdiocese, declined to comment.
   A woman answering the door at Sacred Heart Rectory said Griese
was not in and that she didn't know when he would be back. Messages
left for Griese were not immediately returned.
   However, Griese told the Dayton Daily News early today: ``I
haven't lost anything.'' He did not elaborate.
   The 73-year-old priest criticized Pilarczyk from the pulpit
during Mass on Sept. 17, after Pilarczyk instructed him to ease
enforcement of a church dress code banning shorts, miniskirts, sun
dresses and jeans. Griese had twice denied communion to a man who
went to church dressed in shorts.
   Griese, who has been pastor of Sacred Heart for 21 years, will
remain a priest in good standing, Pilarczyk said in a letter quoted
by the Enquirer.
   The church's mandatory retirement age is 75.
   A letter is to be read Sunday to Sacred Heart parishioners,
announcing Griese's departure and the appointment of a new pastor,
the Enquirer reported.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has put off
appointments with foreign visitors for the time being to deal with
domestic unrest and a political crisis in Lithuania, a source said
today.
   ``It's right,'' said one senior Communist Party official when
asked about news reports that Gorbachev had postponed planned
meetings with Britain's opposition leader and other foreign
dignataries. ``We have many problems right now.''
   The reports sent share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange into
their worst plunge since Oct. 16.
   In New York, stock prices declined slightly in an atmosphere of
uneasiness over the economic outlook and political developments in
the Soviet Union. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down
about 17 points at its early-morning low, was off .43 at 2,795.65
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   The reaction demonstrated how closely Gorbachev is linked by
many in the West to the success of the economic and political
reforms and reductions in East-West tensions he has pursued since
becoming Kremlin leader in March 1985.
   The party official, speaking on condition of anonymity, cited
disturbances along the Iranian border and the Lithuanian Communist
Party's decision to break away from the ruling national party
headed by Gorbachev.
   Soviet Azerbaijanis have tried for four days to force open the
frontier and reunite with their ethnic brethren in Iran, tearing
down guard towers and prompting the KGB to reinforce security along
the frontier. A protest organizer said Thursday the demonstrators
were in retreat.
   Gorbachev met for more than five hours Thursday with Lithuanian
party leaders, who said afterward he failed to sway them from their
decision to split from the 20 million-member ruling party and
pursue local independence.
   The policy-making Central Committee of the national party has
directed Gorbachev to go to Lithuania to try to mend the split. The
No. 2 party leader in Lithuania, Vladimir Beriozov, said the visit
would begin Wednesday and last through Friday.
   Meanwhile, the Estonian Communist Party threw its support to the
Lithuanians in the dispute with Moscow, local journalist Tarmu
Tammerk said today. The Estonian party's Central Committee meeting
on Thursday also set March 23 for its own full congress, which is
expected to vote on a similar proposal to split from the Soviet
party, he said.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennady I. Gerasimov,
would neither confirm nor deny the report that Gorbachev was
putting aside foreign questions to concentrate on the domestic
situation.
   Asked about a report from London that the Soviet Ambassador to
Britain, Leonid Zamyatin, had told Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock
that Gorbachev was postponing a meeting with Kinnock and all
contacts with foreign politicians this month, Gerasimov replied:
   ``Has this meeting been planned? Let The Associated Press
compose its own commentary. For me this is all clear. Let them
comment on that as they wish.''
   A spokesman for Britain's opposition Labor Party said Zamyatin
delivered a personal message from Gorbachev to Kinnock, who had
been scheduled to visit Moscow for talks on Jan. 16.
   The message said the meeting had to be postponed because
``political events in the Soviet Union'' required Gorbachev's
``personal attention and participation,'' the Labor spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who in accordance with British practice declined
to be named, said Gorbachev's message stated that the Soviet leader
was ``postponing contact with foreign politicians scheduled for
January.''
   Gorbachev's calendar is rarely made public, and foreign visitors
sometimes come to Moscow expecting to gain an audience with him but
failing to do so. Whenever he disappears from the public eye,
speculation about his activities and even his health becomes rife.
   The Kremlin leader was last seen on state-run television
delivering a taped New Year's Eve address to the nation Dec. 31.
Moscow-based official media did not report on his closed-door
meeting Thursday with the Lithuanians.
   News of Gorbachev's plans to cancel appointments with visitors
sent the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 225-issue Nikkei average into a
tailspin. The leading market indicator closed down 438.12 points,
or 1.1 percent, from Wednesday.
   It was the largest single-day loss on the exchange since a
647-point plunge on Oct. 16.
   ``To Japan, the worst thing that could happen to the world
scenario would be for Gorbachev to drop from sight,'' said Chris
Schreiber, an investment analyst with New Japan Securities.
   Gorbachev is regarded in Japan as the key to global stability,
he said.
   The president's efforts to reform Soviet society and politics
have created troubles at home, however.
   More than 300 people have died nationwide in ethnic unrest in
two years.
   And in an atmosphere of growing restiveness among the Soviet
Union's many ethnic groups, the Dec. 21 vote by a congress of
Lithuanian Communists to break with Moscow could trigger a stampede
from central party control elsewhere.
   Beriozov, the Lithuanian party leader, reported after the
meeting with Gorbachev that the president said he would not
interfere.
   ``We determined our positions, from which we will not be
moved,'' Romualdas Ozolas, a member of the Lithuanian party's
19-member ruling bureau, told state-run TV in Vilnius, the
republic's capital.
   Previously, Gorbachev opposed the Lithuanian decision to split
from the national party. But he and other officials have also
indicated the Kremlin would not use force to keep the secessionist
Baltic republics in line.
   Lithuania's actions ran counter to more than seven decades of
recognized local party subservience to the Kremlin.
   The Soviet party's 250-member Central Committee, which sets
policy and can change the party's leader _ now Gorbachev _
reportedly includes members who advocate taking strong measures
against the separatists.

   The government will fire about
126,000 of its employees this month in a bid to weed out
unqualified civil service workers who got their jobs through
political patronage, an official said Friday.
   The affected employees hold temporary positions they received
through the intercession of politicians, said Patricia Santo Tomas,
head of the Civil Service Commission.
   ``I would like to think that the 126,000 are people who not
qualified,'' Santo Tomas said. ``They represent the patronage
factor. We're trying to do away with political patronage.''
   Not included are those employees without civil service
eligibility but who have served for 10 years or more, she said.
   The government is the country's biggest employer, with about 1.6
million workers.

   A policeman with a sweet tooth was turned
in by his partner for shoplifting a two-cent piece of candy, but
the state refused to prosecute the case, it was reported Friday.
   The two officers went into a closed candy store in November to
investigate a burglar alarm, which turned out to be faulty, the TT
news agency said. On the way out, one officer took a piece of
candy, and was charged with shoplifting by his partner, TT said.
   Prosecutor Krister Waern said the charge was dropped because the
candy store owner previously had offered treats to police when they
came to his shop late at night to turn off false alarms, TT
reported.
   Other police in Skovde, in south-central Sweden, agreed the
officer was wrong to take the candy but said his partner should not
have reported him.
   The officer was not identified, in keeping with Swedish law.

   Rebel tribesmen hijacked 22
government-owned elephants in the Chittagong hills, it was reported
Friday.
   The elephants, which were trained to carry lumber, vanished
along with their drivers last week in the Bagachari forest, 135
miles southeast of Dhaka, the United News of Bangladesh reported.
   The forest is in the Rangamati district, part of the Chittagong
Hill Tracts where rebel tribesmen have been waging a bush war
against the government since 1976.
   Government troops were searching the forests for the missing
elephants and men, whose fate was not known, the news agency said.
The elephants belonged to the government's Bangladesh Forest
Industries Development Corp.
   Rebels from the Chakma and other tribes seek autonomy for the
hill region, which is rich in timber and natural gas and lies along
the Burmese and Indian borders.
   More than 4,000 people have died in the 14-year-old guerrilla
war. An estimated 30,000 tribespeople have fled to India to escape
the fighting.

   Meteorologists issued a gloomy
weather forecast Friday that could interfere with the launch of the
space shuttle Columbia on a 10-day satellite rescue mission.
   ``Other than the weather, we're looking good,'' NASA test
director Ron Phelps told reporters.
   He said only a 40 percent chance of favorable weather was
predicted for launch time Monday because a rain front was expected
to move into central Florida on Saturday and linger for a while.
   Phelps said the countdown, which started Thursday, was ``real
smooth, and we're not tracking any major problems at the launch
pad.'' The main task Friday was loading liquid hydrogen and liquid
oxygen for Columbia's electricity-producing fuel cells.
   Liftoff is scheduled for 8:10 a.m. Monday for the first of a
record 10 space shuttle missions scheduled in 1990.
   The crew is to deploy a Navy communications satellite and then
track down and retrieve a 21,400-pound science laboratory the size
of a small bus before it falls back to Earth.
   The laboratory, which has been orbiting nearly six years, will
be returned to Earth for a study of its 57 experiments to determine
the effects of long exposure to the radiation and vacuum of space.
Trackers estimate that the lab would re-enter the atmosphere on
Feb. 28 if not retrieved before then.
   Liftoff had been scheduled before Christmas, but problems with
the launch pad, which recently underwent a $50 million overhaul,
forced a postponment.
   The mission's commander is Dan Brandenstein. The other crew
members are pilot Jim Wetherbee and mission specialists Bonnie
Dunbar, Marsha Ivins and David Low. Brandenstein and Dunbar have
made shuttle flights, while the others will be on their first trip.

<TEXT>
   Nineteen members of a Soviet family who
immigrated to Israel this week may have to find another place to
live after disclosing that they are not Jews but members of a
Christian sect.
   Pyotr and Alexandra Trofimov arrived in Israel with 17 children
and grandchildren on Dec. 31 after emigrating from the Crimean city
of Simferopol.
   Like Jewish immigrants to Israel, the Trofimovs were granted
automatic citizenship and given certificates entitling each family
member to $175 and extensive housing and education benefits. They
were housed in three modern apartments in the port city of Haifa.
   The government apparently learned through news reports later
that the family is not Jewish but Pentecostal, a fundamentalist
Christian sect.
   Pyotr Trofimov, 63, said that Pentecostals are persecuted in the
Soviet Union. ``We did not feel ourselves morally free because we
are Christian believers,'' he said in an interview.
   ``My apartment was searched several times and there have been a
number of arrests'' of fellow believers, he said. He added his
children had employment problems because of their religion.
   A spokeswoman for Israel's Interior Ministry said Friday the
family members would be called in and may ``have to find another
place in the world to live.'' The Soviet Union does not take back
citizens who have emigrated.
   Pyotr said the family came to Israel on an invitation through a
daughter who earlier left for the United States. Some Christians
are known to use invitations from Israel to escape to other
countries.
   ``They took our visas and questioned us in small immigration
offices and as they were talking to the first son, he told them we
are Christians and believers,'' Pyotr said.
   But Tova Elinson, the spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry,
which is responsible for issuing citizenship and visa permits, said
the Trofimovs may have misrepresented themselves as Jews. She said
they would not have been given citizenship if officials had known
they were not Jews.
   ``It happens that a clerk may make a mistake on one person, but
not 20!'' she said.
   The family may receive three-month tourist visas and temporary
work permits, during which time they must find another place to
live, Ms. Elinson said.
   Dov Kehat, director-general of the Interior Ministry, said the
family may apply for Israeli citizenship, but it is rarely granted
to non-Jews.
   In the early 1980s, Israel accepted several dozen Vietnamese
``boat people'' as residents.
   Nearly 12,000 Jews immigrated to Israel from the Soviet Union in
1989, a six-fold increase from 1988, and officials predict 30,000
to 50,000 will arrive in 1990.
   Asked if they would consider converting to Judaism, Alexandra
Trofimov, 65, said she knew nothing about the religion but wanted
to learn Hebrew and stay in Israel.
   ``We hope to get work here,'' she said on Israel radio.
   Pyotr Trofimov said he and his wife were manual laborers and
that their children and grandchildren included computer

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, after months of
condemning Panama's Manuel Antonio Noriega as a ``thug'' and a
criminal, is toning down its rhetoric to avoid prejudicing the
deposed dictator's drug-trafficking trial.
   Meanwhile, a Pentagon spokesman said today that an additional
900 American troops have returned to the United States, raising the
total of servicemen who have left Panama since the Dec. 20 invasion
to 2,900.
   The remaining forces in the country stood at 24,500, including
the approximately 12,000 troops who were stationed in Panama before
the invasion.
   The return of the 900 troops was due to the availability of
transport aircraft and the release of ``individuals ... from their
mission,'' said the spokesman, Lt. Col. Keith Schneider. There were
no details on the return of specific units.
   The Defense Department also released revised figures on the
number of Panamanians detained since the invasion. The original
total of 5,600 was revised to 4,230. During the more than two-week
period of the U.S. presence, 3,555 of the 4,230 detainees have been
released.
   An administration official disclosed Thursday that Noriega
surrendered to the U.S. military in Panama City only after the
Vatican embassy gave him a deadline to leave.
   As defense officials were replacing U.S. combat troops in Panama
with rebuilding forces, a senior official said Noriega's longtime
CIA ties have been reviewed and that any potentially damaging
disclosures Noriega might use in his trial defense will be
``manageable.''
   President Bush kept a low profile on the day after he announced
Noriega's Wednesday night surrender to U.S. forces in Panama. Only
days earlier, he had called Noriega a ``thug.''
   Bush telephoned Pope John Paul II to thank him for any efforts
in persuading Noriega to leave the Vatican Embassy in Panama City
and surrender, said the president's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater was low-key in describing Noriega's surrender and
flight to Florida. He declined to answer questions about prospects
for Noriega's prosecution, saying, ``We feel the court system can
handle this case based on the evidence that is presented and the
indictments.''
   Fitzwater's comments, and the later briefing by the senior
official who spoke on condition of anonymity, contrasted with the
inflammatory words the administration has used for months to
describe Noriega.
   Bush himself set that tone, accusing Noriega of corruption,
intimidation, coercion and fraud and calling him ``an outlaw in the
world community.''
   But with Noriega in custody in Miami, the focus shifted Thursday
to the judicial system and his arraignment on charges of accepting
a $4.6 million bribe from Colombian drug lords, and related crimes.
   Toning down the rhetoric now is ``a common-sense'' approach
officials decided to honor, said one administration official.
   Fitzwater said Bush and his aides would be ``very careful in the
days ahead not to offer any comments on the case that might
prejudice it in any way.''
   Fitzwater acknowledged the 1991 budget includes no aid money to
repair invasion-related damage to Panama. Estimates range to more
than $2 billion in losses due to bomb and combat damage, looting
losses and the longer-range losses left by U.S. economic sanctions
against the Noriega regime.
   ``Undoubtedly there will be some international funds, some bank
loans and that sort of thing that would be involved, and at this
point we just can't say how any aid might be financed,'' Fitzwater
said.
   As Bush dispatched Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, to Panama on Thursday to arrange troop
withdrawals, several Democratic members of Congress called for a
quick pullout.
   Meanwhile, the senior official who spoke anonymously gave
reporters new details about Noriega's surrender.
   Bush had stressed that the leader surrendered voluntarily, but
the official said the Vatican gave Noriega a noon Thursday deadline
to leave the embassy.
   ``The papal nuncio had said that his asylum or what have you
would expire by noon today, meaning he (Noriega) would no longer be
a welcome guest,'' the official said.
   In Panama City, Rev. Javier Villanueva, assistant to the papal
nuncio, said it was made clear to Noriega that if he had not given
himself up, ``the Panamanian government, not the U.S. government,
would have been invited to send in forces to take him out.''
However, he said Noriega was not given a specific deadline.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said a Noriega bodyguard
overheard two U.S. servicemen discussing the invasion of Panama
hours before it occurred. It was unclear, however, whether the
guard relayed that information to Noriega, Williams said.
   A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration official said Noriega
might eventually be returned to Panama for trial on other charges,
including murder. That could happen after his U.S. trial, said
David Westrate, assistant DEA administrator.
   Panamanian Vice President Guillermo Ford earlier said Noriega
would be returned to Panama for trial on a long list of charges
after his U.S. trial ends.

<HEAD>Saddam Suggests Peace Talks With Iran, Resuming Air Links</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein on Friday proposed
resuming peace talks with Iran that have been stalled more than a
year, and he suggested the long-hostile nations re-establish air
links.
   ``We are seeking to open a new door for a dignified peace with
Iran,'' Saddam said in a speech marking the 69th anniversary of the
founding of the Iraqi army.
   He hailed advances by the Iraqi arms industry, including the
recent launching of long-range missiles and of a rocket reportedly
capable of putting a satellite in space.
   Saddam suggested that direct meetings between representatives of
Iran and Iraq be held alternately in Tehran and Baghdad under the
auspices of the U.N. secretary-general.
   Fighting in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war ended Aug. 20, 1988,
when both sides accepted a cease-fire based on U.N. Security
Council Resolution 598. Peace talks stalled immediately over
interpretation of the terms of the resolution and priority in
implementing its various clauses.
   Saddam said his proposed dialogue ``will aim at reaching a
common understanding of the clauses of Resolution 598 and fix a
timetable for its implementation ... provided that the talks are
completed within a period not exceeding three months.''
   There was no immediate response from Iran.
   Iran has insisted that resumption of talks be preceded by the
withdrawal of Iraqi troops from 1,065 square miles of Iranian
territory it claims are still under occupation.
   Iraq, meanwhile, wants Iran to accept a new border giving Iraq
total control of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway. Under a 1975 accord,
the border was drawn down the middle of the waterway, which is
Iraq's main outlet to the sea.
   Saddam proposed an immediate exchange of all wounded and sick
prisoners of war as the first step in reviving negotiations. That
would be followed by the release of the longest-held POWs, mainly
those captured in the early stages of the war, he said.
   He also called for registering thousands of prisoners who have
not been included in lists provided to the Red Cross. The agency
has registered 50,182 prisoners held by Iran and 19,284 by Iraq,
but U.N. officials and diplomats say there are at least 100,000
POWs held by both sides.
   The Red Cross mediated an agreement to repatriate ailing and
crippled POWs immediately after the cease-fire. The agreement
collapsed after the release of only 400 prisoners as the sides
accused each other of falsifying the number of captives.
   The president said establishing air links between Iran and Iraq
would ``secure an atmosphere of peace and security among the people
of Iran and Iraq.''
   Air links between the countries were cut off shortly before the
war broke out in September 1980.
   Dealing with the advances in Iraq's arms industry, Saddam
attacked the United States for expressing concern over new Iraqi
missiles without saying anything about Israel's nuclear capability.
   Iraq announced last month it had launched a 48-ton three-stage
rocket capable of placing a satellite in space. It also said it had
test-fired two surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 1,243
miles, long enough to reach Israel.
   Washington confirmed the test-firings.
   Israel complained the Iraqi advances, coupled with its
stockpiling of chemical weapons and reported efforts to acquire a
nuclear capability, posed a serious threat.
   Citing a similar excuse in 1981, Israel launched a long-range
air raid that destroyed a French-built nuclear reactor near Baghdad.
   Saddam said Iraq will ``retaliate firmly and with precision to
any attempt by the Zionist entity (Israel) to strike at Iraq's
scientific or military installations.''
   ``If Israel undertakes any aggression, the United States will
not be able to absolve itself from the responsibility of
encouraging such an act,'' he said.

<HEAD>Drug Traffickers Kidnap at Least 20 in War Against Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug traffickers in Medellin have
abducted at least 20 people, including members of Colombia's
richest families, as part of their terrorist war against the
government, police said Friday.
   Most of the victims were kidnapped in the last two months in
Medellin, the center of the country's cocaine trade, said a police
spokesman in Medellin.
   The spokesman, reached by telephone, refused to identify himself.
   A statement sent by the Medellin cartel said traffickers had
ordered the ``leaders of working-class neighborhoods to take
members of the traditional oligarchy hostage.''
   Half of the ransom paid by family members for the release of the
hostages will be used to finance the war against the government of
President Virgilio Barco, said the communique, published Friday in
local newspapers.
   The cartel said it would use the other half of the money to
finance the construction of housing for the needy. The communique
did not mention the amount of ransom demanded by traffickers.
   The cartel offered no explanation as to why it would need money
at a time when its reputed leader, Pablo Escobar, has a personal
fortune estimated at $2 billion.
   Government officials have suggested that Escobar's cocaine
smuggling business has been hurt by the government's war on drugs
but it appeared the wave of kidnappings was the Medellin cartel's
latest attempt to pressure the government into abandoning its war
on drugs.
   Barco launched the offensive in August after traffickers killed
Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a leading presidential candidate.
Authorities have confiscated hundreds of properties allegedly
belonging to the traffickers, extradited 11 drug suspects to the
United States and killed one leader of the Medellin cartel, Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha, in a gunfight.
   Traffickers have responded with a wave of bombings and
assassinations that have left 261 people dead and more than 1,200
injured.
   In the last few days, Medellin authorities have distributed
handbills offering $450,000 reward for information leading to
Escobar's capture.
   ``Yesterday it was Rodriguez Gacha; tommorow it will be Pablo
Escobar,'' the handbills read.
   A spokeswoman for the investigative unit of the national police
said that evidence indicates that Escobar ordered the Dec. 20
kidnapping of the son of Barco's closest adviser.
   A group of men apparently working for Escobar forced Alvaro
Diego Montoya into a car as he was walking out of the northern
Bogota offices of his financial services firm.
   The victim is the son of German Montoya, Barco's
secretary-general.
   A senior government official, asking not to be identified, said
anonymous callers to the president's office announced that Montoya
would be held until Barco agreed to negotiate with traffickers.
   In Friday's communique, traffickers reiterated their willingness
to talk but added they would never surrender to the government.
   ``We will not drop the flag, but will redouble our fight to
surprise an imperialistic and unpatriotic government that has seen
fit to declare itself victorious,'' the communique said.
   Barco's government has refused negotiation.

<HEAD>Delta Says Trans-Atlantic Flights Threatened</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines is beefing up security following
a threat against the airline's trans-Atlantic flights, even though
airline officials say they think it is a hoax.
   Delta spokesman Jim Lundy said Thursday the ``general threat''
did not name a particular flight, city or day. He would not discuss
the nature of the threat or say when it was received.
   ``We really do believe it's a hoax, but we can't treat it that
way,'' said Neil Monroe, another Delta spokesman.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Richard Stafford said
the agency was aware of the situation but refused to say what
action, if any, was being taken.
   Delta's trans-Atlantic operations include flights to and from
Germany, Ireland, England and France. Lundy said passengers were
being notified of the threat upon check-in and were given the
option of canceling or delaying their trips.
   Delta officials said Thursday evening that roughly only 20 to 30
of 700 ticket holders on its four international flights scheduled
out of Atlanta during the night had switched airlines.
   Lundy said the intensified security would remain in effect until
officials are sure the threat has ended or it is confirmed as a
hoax.
   Last week, Northwest Airlines received a bomb threat against its
flight from Paris to Detroit. After passengers were told they could
cancel their tickets, a Northwest DC-10, which can carry 284
passengers, made a safe flight Saturday carrying 28 passengers and
14 crew members.
   ``There has been so much attention on the Northwest situation,
it generates additional activity,'' Monroe said.

<TEXT>
   People who play contact sports can be held
liable for the injuries they inflict on others if their conduct is
willful or recklessly disregards others' safety, the state Supreme
Court said today.
   The high court used a case stemming from a ``pickup'' basketball
game in Omaha to spell out when people who participate in contact
sports can be held responsible for injuries they cause to others.
The judges also provided a definition of ``reckless'' behavior.
   The case involved a suit brought by Joseph Dotzler against Bruce
Tuttle. Dotzler suffered two fractured wrists in 1984 when Tuttle
allegedly pushed him during a basketball game at an Omaha YMCA.
   A jury decided the case in favor of Tuttle.
   The Supreme Court reversed that decision and ordered a new
trial, saying District Judge Theordore L. Carlson didn't properly
instruct the jury.
   The trial court shouldn't have allowed the issue of contributory
negligence _ whether Dotzler's conduct was partly responsible for
his own injuries _ to be considered, the Supreme Court said.
   Dotzler testified that he was standing still when he was
allegedly pushed by Tuttle. Tuttle said he wasn't particularly
aware of Dotzler's position on the basketball court.
   ``That was all of the evidence in the record and it was not
sufficient to permit a finding by the jury of absence of lookout or
lack of control'' on Dotzler's part, Chief Justice William Hastings
wrote.
   ``Jury instructions should be confined to the issues found in
the pleadings and which find support in the evidence,'' the opinion
said.
   Judge C. Thomas White did not participate in the 6-0 decision.
   The judges said the case raised the issue of what constitutes
``recklessness'' under Nebraska law, and what standard of liability
applies to someone who injures another during a contact sport.
   The judges held that ``a participant in a game involving a
contact sport such as basketball is liable for injuries ... only if
his or her conduct is such that it is either willful or with a
reckless disregard for the safety of the other player, but is not
liable for ordinary negligence.''
   The high court defined recklessness in part as ``the disregard
for or indifference to the safety of another or for the
consequences of one's act.''
   ``Recklessness differs from intentional wrongdoing in that while
the act must be intended by the actor in order to be considered
reckless, the actor does not intend to cause the harm which results
from the act,'' the court wrote.

   Longworth D. Quinn, chief judge of Detroit's 36th
District Court and son of the longtime editor and publisher of the
Michigan Chronicle, has died at age 46, apparently a suicide,
police say.
   Quinn was found dead Thursday by his mother, Dorothy Quinn, at
her home, police said. He had been shot once in the head.
   Inspector Gerald Stewart, who said Quinn apparently killed
himself, said a will and other personal papers were stacked neatly
together on a nearby dresser. Police said Quinn left a note but
they declined to reveal its contents.
   A friend, the Rev. Dan Aldridge, said Quinn was despondent over
the deaths of his father, Longworth M. Quinn, last year and of a
girlfriend who jumped to her death from an apartment building in
1984. The elder Quinn ran the Michigan Chronicle, a weekly
newspaper serving the black community, for many years.
   Quinn was elected to the district court in 1981 and was chosen
chief judge by his colleagues in May.
   In addition to his mother, he is survived by two sisters. There
was no immediate word of funeral arrangements.

   A man convicted of hit-and-run driving in
the traffic accident that killed childhood kidnap victim Steven
Stayner has been sentenced to 90 days in jail.
   Antonio Loera, 28, who had pleaded no contest, also was placed
on probation for one year Thursday by Merced County Superior Court
Judge George C. Barrett. His driver's license is automatically
suspended for one year.
   Stayner's motorcycle slammed into Loera's car on a
rain-slickened road.
   District Attorney Frank Dougherty said he agreed to the plea
bargain because investigators found that the carburetor in Loera's
car was defective and made the car stall.
   Dougherty said that prevented him from proving that Loera
violated the right-of-way, so he dropped a vehicular manslaughter
count.
   Stayner disappeared at the age of 7 while walking home from
school in Merced in December 1972.
   In March 1980, Stayner turned up at the police station in Ukiah,
about 200 miles north of Merced, with a 5-year-old boy who had been
abducted from that area a few days earlier. Kenneth Parnell, a
drifter, was sent to prison for kidnapping both youths but now is
free on parole.
   Stayner returned to his parents in Merced, completed high school
and was married in 1985. He and his wife had two children, aged 2
and 3. He was 24 when he died.

<HEAD>Airlines Say `Die Hard II' Endorses Terrorism, Protest Stapleton
Filming</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airline officials are angry that portions of Bruce
Willis' ``Die Hard II,'' will be shot at Stapleton International
Airport, contending that the film ``is an endorsement of
terrorism.''
   ``It involves terrorism, violence against airports, destruction
of an aircraft and a crash,'' Jack Ekey, general manager of United
Airlines' Denver operations, said Thursday.
   ``As a matter or principle, we don't believe that kind of thing
represents either airports or airlines in a way which we see
ourselves or want the public to see us,'' he said.
   Twentieth Century-Fox plans to start shooting the film at
Stapleton and in Weld County Jan. 15.
   Representatives of all airlines that use Stapleton lodged a
complaint last week with airport officials.
   Greg Lazzaro, location manager of the film, said the airlines'
position is ``total, unadulterated bull'' and ``preposterous and
stupid.''
   Ekey said the film script, which has not been shown to the
airlines, is the story of a police officer's battle against
terrorists who try to take over Dulles International Airport in
suburban Washington.
   The plot of the sequel to ``Die Hard'' is heavy on wisecracks
and liberal in the use of automatic weapons and plastic explosives
in the abuse of private property, he said.
   ``To say it's an airport-bashing movie is unfair,'' Lazzaro
said. ``It's not a movie about airlines; it's a movie about a New
York cop who's in a cartoon.''
   In response to the protests, Stapleton officials placed added
restrictions on the filmmakers, including prohibiting the filming
of real airline logos and aircraft.
   ``It really paints a bad picture of aviation and of all people
who work at airports,'' said George Doughty, Denver aviation
director. ``I don't like it either, but our position is that it's
going to be filmed somewhere and there are some major benefits to
letting it be filmed here.''

<HEAD>Minimum Hard-Currency Exchange Rule Dropped for Foreigners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The warming trend between East and West has
had a positive side-effect for foreigners, with visitors no longer
required to hand over a minimum of $14 for each day of their stay
in East Germany
   Under an aid agreement with Bonn, East Germany has ended its
age-old ``Zwangsumtausch,'' or the ``forced exchange'' that aimed
to increase the socialist state's hard-currency coffers.
   Officials from the two nations announced in December that West
Germans would no longer be required to make the minimum conversion
after Jan. 1. The extension of the benefit to other foreigners has
come as a surprise.
   ``We've heard that was the case, but we have nothing official on
it yet,'' U.S. Embassy spokesman Jaroslav Verner commented when
asked if U.S. authorities had been informed of the change.
   Tourists from the United States, France, Great Britain and other
nations required to enter East Germany through Checkpoint Charlie
have found empty money exchange booths at that border crossing.
   No public announcement of the policy change has been made, but
East German officials confirmed Friday that all visitors can enter
free of charge.
   Franz Koeckerbauer, spokesman for the Finance Ministry, said
border authorities stopped demanding the exchange minimum on Dec.
23 when the Berlin Wall, which was built in 1961, was opened at the
historic Brandenburg Gate. Hundreds of thousands poured through the
new opening in the wall to make the towering gate accessible to
pedestrians from East and West Berlin.
   East Germany's ADN news agency reported that 3.7 million people
passed between East and West Berlin over the New Year's holiday
weekend, although it did not indicate if that figure included an
estimate of the thousands who simply scaled the graffiti-splattered
wall rather than using designated border crossings.
   Bernd Schroeter, a spokesman for East Germany's state bank, said
the decision to suspend minimum currency exchange requirements for
all visitors was connected with the agreement reached with West
Germany in early December.
   Under the deal agreed to by Communist Premier Hans Modrow and
Rudolf Seiters, the chief of staff for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Bonn
is financing a special hard-currency fund for East Germans in
exchange for ending the conversion minimum for West Germans.
   Schroeter said the West German measures compensating East
Germany for the lost revenue extended to the entire fund, not just
the revenue from West Germans.
   Western diplomats estimate that East Germany earned between $294
million and $441 million annually from forced conversion.
   Schroeter said he could not estimate what percentage of the
total came from foreigners other than West Germans.
   Visitors are forbidden to take East German marks with them when
they leave the country, so in the past much of the currency was
left behind with friends or relatives, or squandered at overpriced
restaurants.
   Under the new currency exchange rules, foreigners can change
their hard currencies at a rate that gives them three times as many
East German marks as under the old system _ but only if they want
to.

<HEAD>Two AIDS-Related Viruses Common Among Drug Users, Female
Prostitutes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SARAH NORDGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two distant cousins of the AIDS virus that
usually are carried by drug users are also fairly common among
female prostitutes, say researchers who interviewed and tested more
than 1,300 prostitutes.
   The study released Thursday, done by researchers at the federal
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, expands the groups
considered at risk for the viruses and further underscores the
importance of public-health efforts to prevent their spread, said
Irvin Chen, an outside expert who also has done research on the
viruses.
   The viruses, called HTLV-I and HTLV-II, are transmitted much
like the AIDS virus: through shared hypodermic needles, sexual
intercourse and from infected mothers to their babies.
   HTLV-I has been linked to a type of leukemia and a serious
neurological disorder. As many as 5 percent of those who test
positive for the virus eventually contract leukemia, the CDC
researchers said.
   The second virus, HTLV-II, has not been clearly associated with
disease. It is, however, so closely related to HTLV-I that tests
sophisticated enough to differentiate between the two are not yet
available, the researchers said.
   For that reason, researchers used a test for both viruses on the
1,305 prostitutes examined between 1986 and 1988. The women all
were older than 18 and had had a median of 2,900 sexual encounters.
   Of those tested, 6.7 percent were found positive for the
viruses, said Dr. Rima Khabbaz, lead researcher of the study
reported in Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   While the single most important risk factor for carrying the
virus was drug abuse, 2.4 percent of the women who reported no
history of intravenous drug abuse and had no needle marks also
tested positive, according to the study.
   ``It's clear that both of these viruses are found in intravenous
drug abusers in this country,'' said Chen, a researcher at the
University of California-Los Angeles who specializes in the viruses.
   ``It's interesting that they're finding it in another group _
among female prostitutes. It just extends the range of the
viruses.''
   The researchers studied women in Atlanta; Miami; Los Angeles;
San Francisco; southern Nevada; Colorado Springs, Colo.; Newark,
N.J.; and four other New Jersey cities.
   Prostitutes in Newark were most likely to carry the viruses,
with 25.4 percent testing positive, while none of the prostitutes
tested in southern Nevada was found to carry the viruses.
   Khabbaz and Chen agreed that the findings carry important
public-health implications.
   ``It's clear now that all of these viruses ... are transmitted
in the same way,'' Chen said. ``In the public-health point of view,
anything that can be done to prevent the spread of these viruses is
essential.''
   ``Control measures, such as the use of condoms to prevent other
sexually transmitted diseases ... should be encouraged,'' Khabbaz
and her colleagues wrote.
   ``Finally, control measures aimed at (intravenous) drug use and
the sharing of needles and other blood-contaminated injection
paraphernalia are urgently needed.''

   Thirteen people have been charged with
murder or conspiracy after five family members were found buried at
an Ohio farm rented by the leader of a religious splinter group,
federal authorities said today.
   Five of those charged were arrested late Thursday and early
today in Kansas City and nearby Independence, said George Rodriguez
of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Kansas
City.
   ``Two of those arrested have confessed to their participation in
the mass murders,'' Rodriguez said at a news conference. He said
authorities have a motive but would not release it.
   The Cleveland Plain Dealer, quoting police sources the newspaper
did not name, said the five may have been killed as part of a
religious sacrifice.
   Rodriguez said federal authorities would not comment on that
report for fear of prejudicing juries. He said it was accurate to
characterize Lundgren as the leader of a cult.
   The bodies of the Dennis Avery family were found Wednesday night
and Thursday at a Kirtland, Ohio, farm.
   Rodriguez said they were members of a splinter religious group
led by Jeffrey Lundgren, a former lay minister of the Reorganized
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which is headquartered
in Independence.
   The dead were identified tentatively as Dennis Avery, 49; his
wife, Cheryl, 42; and their three daughters, Trina, 13; Rebecca, 9;
and Karen, 5. Rodriguez said the family, originally from
Independence, apparently had lived off and on at Lundgren's farm in
Ohio and were killed around April 16-18.
   Lundgren, 39, and his wife, Alice, 38, were among those charged
and were being sought today. Lundren was charged with five counts
of aggravated murder. His wife was charged with five counts of
conspiracy to commit aggravated murder.
   Authorities were led to the bodies on farm about 25 miles
northeast of Cleveland by an anonymous tip, said Kirtland Fire
Chief Richard Martincic.
   The Plain Dealer quoted a police source as saying cult members
had to perform the sacrifice before traveling west ``where they
would be cleansed and could search for a `golden sword,''' which
was not further characterized.
   A Kirtland police spokesman said officers who had worked on the
investigation almost non-stop for 48 hours were resting early today
and were unavailable for comment on the report of human sacrifice.
   Authorities would not say how the five died. Authorities sent
the bodies to Cleveland for autopsies.
   A neighbor of the commune in Ohio said the group appeared to
leave the area last April.
   Deputy Sheriff Rick Ring of Johnson County, Mo., said Lundgren
and a group of people had been living in a barn near Chilhowee, a
rural area about 45 miles southeast of Kansas City, and were last
seen in the area in late October or early November.
   Rodriguez said it was not known whether Lundgren was in the
Kansas City area, but authorities were in contact with his wife's
parents in the area.
   The group led by Lundgren apparently disbanded late in December
after members became disgruntled, Rodriguez said.
   Rodriguez said the group following Lundgren consisted of 29 men,
women and children, but some members, including the Avery family,
came and went.
   Ron Luff, 29, of Independence was arrested and charged with
murder. Those arrested and charged with five counts each of
conspiracy to commit aggravated murder were identified as Susan
Luff, 31, of Springfield, and Dennis Patrick, 35, Tonya Patrick,
33, and Debbie Olivarez, 37, all of Independence.
   Those charged with murder but not in custody this morning were
Richard Brand, 26, of Independence, Damon Lundgren, 19, no hometown
given, and Gregory Winship, 29, of Euclid, Ohio. Kathryn Johnson,
36, of Holden was charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated
murder but not yet arrested.
   The names of two others charged in the case were not released.
   Rodriguez said he expected more arrests later today. Those being
held will be extradited to Ohio to face the state charges, he said.
   Lundgren left the church after his ministry credentials were
revoked and formed his own religious group, said Dale Luffman,
president of the northeast Ohio chapter of the Reorganized Church.
   Luffman would not describe the practices of Lundgren's group or
why Lundgren lost his credentials. Another family and other
individuals shared a house with Lundgren, his wife and children.
   The group of up to 10 people living at the house had been under
investigation for more than a year for alleged civil rights
violations, according to Kirtland Police Chief Dennis Yarborough,
who declined to specify the alleged violations.
   Grant McMurray, world church secretary at the Reorganized
Church's headquarters in Independence, Mo., said Lundgren's lay
minister's credentials were revoked when his beliefs strayed too
far from the church.
   McMurray said his church has about 250,000 members worldwide. He
said it is not affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, although both groups
base their beliefs on the Book of Mormon and the Bible.
   Kirtland is an important site in the history of the church
founded by Joseph Smith, Luffman said. Smith built a temple there
in 1836, he said.

   Revelations that the suspect in a pregnant woman's
killing was her husband, not an inner-city mugger as reported,
stirred angry demands for amends from residents of the neighborhood
where the slaying occurred.
   ``We're looking for an apology and we want it to go
nationwide,'' cried Adline Stallings, who lives in the city's
Mission Hill area.
   The mostly black neighborhood became the backdrop for the
sensational case of Carol and Charles Stuart, middle-class, white
suburban professionals, in what was cast as a fatal encounter with
inner-city violence.
   Stuart, 29, told police that a mugger had fatally shot his
30-year-old wife in the head and shot him in the abdomen after they
left a childbirth class at a hospital the night of Oct. 23.
   The story touched the worst fears among white America of black
inner-city violence when it exploded in headlines and on news
reports nationwide.
   At the first of two news conferences today to express concern
over the case, Sadiki Kambon, director of thee Black Community
Information Center in Roxbury, called on the mayor to fire police
Commissioner Francis Roache.
   He accused the police of arresting a black man in the case
``because of his skin color and the Boston police's need for a
victim to satisfy the hunger of white racism in Boston and
America.''
   Kambon cited allegedly abusive behavior by police in searches of
black residents of the Mission Hill area during the investigation.
   ``I demand an apology from the mayor of Boston not just to
Mission Hill, but to every black person in the city of Boston who
was traumatized and victimized by political hysteria,'' said Louis
Elisa, president of the NCAAP Boston chapter. ``Every white person
was looking at members of the black community as a possible
killer.''
   Police said Stuart committed suicide Thursday morning by jumping
off a Boston bridge after apparently learning that police were
about to arrest him for the slayings of his wife and infant son,
Christopher. The baby was born prematurely after the shooting and
died 17 days later.
   Stuart claimed a black man was the assailant and police
descended on the area, going house to house seeking anyone who fit
the description he provided.
   ``It wasn't fair,'' said Stallings, a member of the Mission Main
Task Force board of directors. The slant of the publicity, Ms.
Stallings said, was ``as if we, the people who live here in this
development, were involved in a crime.''
   But words alone might not satisfy people like Sara Flint-Elsey,
executive director of Tenants United for Public Housing Progress, a
group representing the 60,000 public housing tenants in Boston.
   ``I got phone calls from relatives as far away as California.
They said `What is going on in Boston? It's really pathetic,'' Ms.
Flint-Elsey said.
   Ms. Flint-Elsey, who is black and lives in the largely black
Roxbury section of Boston, said publicity around the Stuart case
inflamed racial tensions not felt since the school busing crisis a
decade ago.
   ``I felt this city was ready to explode on the implications that
a black man had done this to a white woman,'' Ms. Flint-Elsey said.
   Mission Hill, where rescuers found the Stuarts, is part of the
city already under siege from violence police blame largely on
drugs and gang warfare.
   City Councilor Bruce Bolling, a black whose district includes
part of Mission Hill, said the struggle of the poorer neighborhoods
was irrevocably damaged by the way the story was presented and
spread.
   ``It has left permanent shame on Boston's black community and
has had a chilling effect on development,'' Bolling charged
Thursday.
   ``This case has stirred the racial fears, not only in Boston,
but nationally in neighborhoods in urban America,'' Bolling said
``A whole race of people have been maligned.''
   In addtition to the reaction by blacks, residents throughout
Boston and its suburbs were stunned and confused by the news.
   ``I would say the whole town is shocked. They were portrayed as
a model couple,'' said Wally Arsenault, a restaurant manager in
Reading, 15 miles north of Boston where the Stuarts lived.

   ``Salute the heroic, fearless Romanian people,''
reads one postcard mailed to the Romanian Embassy in Beijing. It is
signed, ``a Chinese.''
   ``The dictator is ousted, welcome a new era,'' begins another,
signed ``a Chinese citizen.''
   The embassy has received several dozen messages of
congratulations from official Chinese institutes, workers and even
a soldier in the two weeks since Romanian citizens rose up against
hard-line Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu.
   ``All expressed solidarity with the Romanian people and
satisfaction with what happened in our country, but said nothing
about their own problems,'' a Romanian diplomat said Friday,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Many Chinese were elated because the Romanian rebels defeated an
armed attack of the kind that China's hard-line leaders mounted to
crush Chinese pro-democracy protesters on June 3-4. Ceausescu
applauded China's crackdown.
   The diplomat was amazed that Chinese mail workers delivered the
postcards with daring references to ``the reactionary ruler'' and
``the dictator.''
   ``They must have seen the messages, they are open,'' he said.
   The postcards were anonymous, but one letter came from workers
at the No. 2 Automobile Factory in central China, a leading
state-owned facility, and two Chinese who telephoned from Beijing
factories said they spoke for their co-workers.
   Even a unit of the government-run Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences and several other state institutions sent signed letters,
the diplomat said _ before Chinese Premier Li Peng and President
Yang Shangkun recognized the new Romanian government Dec. 27.
   ``Everyone expressed concern, everyone was very warm _ even
warmer than before,'' said a second diplomat. ``It was very
touching.''
   The embassy itself, which has just seven diplomats, held a
meeting on Dec. 23, while fighting still raged between pro- and
anti-Ceausescu forces, and decided to support the rebels. They
hauled down their Romanian flag and raised one without the hated
Communist Party emblem.
   Someone stitched together swatches of red, blue and yellow silk
to make a tiny new flag for the ambassador's car.
   More than a dozen portraits of Ceausescu were taken down from
embassy walls, leaving empty hooks and faint white outlines.
   ``We were so happy, we were all so relieved,'' the second
diplomat said.
   The diplomats said that like the Chinese, they received
information about the fighting in Romania mainly from foreign news
reports. But many Chinese, assuming the embassy had up-to-date
information, called and asked for the latest news.
   ``They told us they were listening to the Voice of America and
British Broadcasting Corp. _ they said they were keeping their
radios on, just like in June,'' one said.
   China's government-controlled media said nothing about the
Romanian uprising for several days, and then gave only sketchy
reports without explaining its motives. Nonetheless, the news
spread rapidly, and posters mocking Ceausescu and Chinese leaders
went up quickly at three Beijing colleges.
   Students at seven colleges gathered on campus in silent protests
or made plans to do so but were stopped. The Chinese government
responded by canceling plans to lift 7-month-old martial law in
Beijing, and instead putting the army and police on alert,
according to unofficial sources.
   The diplomats said no Chinese have come in person to the embassy
to offer congratulations. Contacts with the Chinese government have
continued normally, they said.
   From the Chinese Communist Party, however, there has been only
silence.

   Nissan Motor Corp., which paid more than
$600,000 last year to settle federal sex and racial bias
complaints, is launching an affirmative action program, the company
said.
   President Kazutoshi Hagiwara told Nissan Motor's 2,300 employees
nationwide in a Jan. 2 letter that the goal of the plan at the
company's Carson headquarters and 11 regional sales and
distribution offices was to improve the company's ``overall
utilization of minorities and females and their distribution
throughout the company.''
   In February, Nissan agreed to pay $605,000 and promote dozens of
women, blacks, Hispanics and older workers to settle a 4{-year
federal investigation of employment discrimination by the automaker.
   The new affirmative action program is voluntary and not part of
Nissan's agreement with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, said John T. Weakly, director of human resources and
administration at Nissan's Carson headquarters.

<TEXT>
   A man paroled in 1987 in the killing of
an 8-year-old girl was arraigned today on charges of murdering
eight of the women involved in serial slayings in the Rochester
area since March 1988.
   Arthur Shawcross, 44, a food service worker, pleaded innocent to
eight murder counts before Rochester City Judge John Manning Regan
and was sent to the Monroe County Jail without bail.
   State Police Superintendent Thomas Constantine said in Albany
that charges will be brought against Shawcross in at least three
more Rochester murders and that he is a suspect in other deaths.
   The bodies of at least 14 slain women have been found in the
area in the past 22 months. Deputy Rochester Police Chief Terrence
Rickard said there may have been as many as 17 serial victims and
that Shawcross may have told authorities where to find three
bodies, not two, as earlier reported.
   The Rochester Democrat &amp; Chronicle newspaper said one body was
recovered late Thursday in Clarkson.
   Rochester Police Chief Gordon Urlacher said today that police
think he was responsible for 11 of the murders.
   ``We've said all along that we don't believe all these cases
were related, and that's the way it turned out,'' Constantine said.
   According to police, Shawcross was arrested Wednesday after
officers in a police helicopter saw a car speeding away from the
culvert where a woman's body was found in Sweden, about 12 miles
west of Rochester.
   ``The person derives some type of satisfaction from the murder
and it's very possible that they go back and look at the results,''
Constantine said.
   The Syracuse Post-Standard quoted sources as saying the suspect
told police several women were killed for mocking him when he was
unable to engage in sex; another was killed when she broke the gear
shift knob in his girlfriend's car; another because he thought she
lied about being a virgin; and yet another because she pushed him
into he Genesee River while they were swimming.
   According to the state Department of Correctional Services,
Shawcross served 15 years of a 25-year sentence after a 1972
first-degree manslaughter conviction in Watertown, N.Y. Shawcross
was convicted of killing Karen Ann Hill, 8, of Rochester, who was
strangled and sexually molested while visiting Watertown.
   Shawcross also confessed to strangling 10-year-old John Blake,
of Watertown, according to retired Watertown Police Detective
Charles Kubinski, who interrogated Shawcross about the killings.
   Shawcross was paroled from Green Haven state prison in June 1987
and appeared to be adapting well to life outside prison, Edward
Elwin, executive director of the state Division of Parole, said
today.
   ``Superficially, he was making a good adjustment,'' Elwin said.
   Shawcross had tried to settle in Delhi, in rural Delaware
County, following his parole, but was moved by parole officials to
Rochester after about two weeks when residents complained about his
presence.
   Investigators first questioned Shawcross Wednesday while they
were searching for a missing woman west of Rochester, according to
news reports. Searchers found one woman's body in the area
Wednesday afternoon and a second woman's body Thursday.
   When the suspect was brought in again for questioning Thursday,
he confessed to 10 of the killings, according to Rochester
television station WOKR, which quoted unidentified police sources.
   About 60 state troopers, forest rangers from the state
Department of Environmental Conservation and town of Ogden police
searched the Monroe County towns of Ogden, Riga and Sweden for
clues into the latest deaths.
   Most of the women, including June Cicero, 34, of Rochester,
whose body was found frozen in a creek Wednesday in Ogden, were
involved in prostitution or drugs, police said.
   The first body found Thursday, believed to be that of a female,
was discovered at about 8:15 a.m. in Sweden by a local resident,
according to Capt. David L. Christler of the state police. Police
were unable to immediately identify that body.
   Investigators began looking in the Northampton Park area Sunday
after a park worker found a pair of pants and boots in the snow.
Inside the pants was a Social Security card belonging to Felicia
Stephens, 20, who was last seen by her boyfriend, Raymond
Pendergrass, in Rochester on Dec. 26, police said. The park is
about 13 miles west of Rochester.

   A former chemist for the Food and Drug
Administration was sentenced Friday to 30 days in prison for taking
$4,300 in bribes to influence the government's approval of generic
drugs made by two companies.
   U.S. District Judge John Hargrove sentenced David Brancato to
three, two-year prison terms, but suspended all but 30 days.
Brancoto was also fined $3,000, ordered to serve 500 hours of
community service and put on probation for three years.
   He was accused of accepting bribes from Ashok Patel, former
senior vice president of Par Pharmaceuticals of Spring Valley,
N.Y., and Dilip Shah, former president of Quad Pharmaceuticals of
Indianapolis.
   Patel and Shah were convicted earlier.
   Prosecutors said Brancato, who worked in the FDA's Rockville
office, took the money in exchange for favorable FDA treatment of
applications for approval of generic drugs produced by the
companies.
   Generic drugs are the chemical equivalents of brand-name drugs
whose exclusive marketing patents have expired. The rush by generic
drug companies to win FDA approval for their cheaper products has
created a lucrative market susceptible to corruption, investigators
say.
   In all, the generic drug probe has resulted in guilty pleas from
three officials of generic drug companies, three FDA chemists and
two pharmaceutical companies.
   Brancato, who pleaded guilty earlier to three counts of
receiving illegal gratuities, actually took $16,000 in bribes from
four drug manufacturers, said prosecutor Gary Jordan. Brancato was
charged only with taking $4,300 in bribes.

   An Argentine was placed on probation for two years
Friday for conspiring to export a IBM computer system valued at

   Jorge Stein, 34, of Buenos Aires was charged in October 1989
with attempting to export the computer system to Bulgaria after
shipping it through France.
   The federal complaint charged that Stein indicated to an
informant that he would apply for a Commerce Department export
license using a fictitious name and address in Paris, but that the

   Stein pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge. A Miami company,
Dinorall Corp., which also entered a guilty plea in the case, was

<HEAD>Burgeoning Democracies Put Squeeze on U.S. Foreign Aid Funds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush administration policymakers, faced with a
foreign aid squeeze because of the need to reward emerging
democracies in Panama and Eastern Europe, are looking primarily to
the Pentagon budget for possible relief, say congressional and
private sources.
   One growing school of thought argues that changes in the world's
security balance now mean that U.S. interests abroad are better
maintained by diplomacy than by threat of force, and that at least
a small amount of the military money saved through arms treaties
and lessened tensions should go for foreign aid.
   Others in the administration and on Capitol Hill are talking
about nicking the largest current aid recipients _ countries such
as Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, Turkey and Greece _ to pay for
assistance to the new democracies. That option, however, is seen as
more politically difficult and therefore less likely than others.
   The administration this week sent a delegation to Panama to
evaluate the need for U.S. assistance in reviving a once-robust
economy crippled by American trade sanctions. Early estimates of
needed aid are running upwards of $1 billion over several years.
   Bush also has pledged that Eastern European countries that adopt
democracy and reform their economies can expect help of the sort
that Congress voted last year for Poland and Hungary, which
together are getting $840 million over the next three years.
   But the new aid will have to be found in a foreign assistance
budget that already is strained beyond its limits, leaving some
friendly countries to do without. About a dozen nations that
normally could expect some U.S. economic aid this year will end up
with nothing, said Mark Edelman, acting administrator of the State
Department's Agency for International Development.
   ``We have a hell of a problem, and it's getting tighter and
tighter and tighter,'' Edelman said in an interview.
   Of the $14.6 billion in this year's foreign aid package, Israel
has received $3 billion and Egypt $2.1 billion. Those two, along
with Pakistan, Greece and Turkey, get the lion's share of U.S.
economic and military aid and are protected by congressional
earmarks. What's left is parceled out in far smaller amounts to
several dozen other countries.
   As the year wears on and Congress begins deliberations on a 1991
aid bill, matters are bound to get worse, officials say. Foreign
aid is among the least popular programs on Capitol Hill, meaning
the growing U.S. commitments must somehow be shoehorned into a
budget that will remain essentially unchanged.
   ``We only have so much,'' said Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``It may
not be possible for some countries to do quite as well'' as they
have in the past. ``The American people understand that we are
going to have to help in countries like Romania and
Czechoslovakia.''
   ``There's a bottom line: If you want to do more here, you've got
to do less there,'' said Edelman.
   ``There is going to be a squeeze,'' predicted William Hellert,
an analyst with the Overseas Development Council, a
Washington-based advocacy group for development in poorer countries.
   He noted that not only are Panama and Eastern Europe likely to
expect new aid from the United States, but other countries may make
claims as well: Namibia, which is gaining its independence from
South Africa; and Mozambique and Angola, where settlements of civil
wars are hoped for.
   In addition, the United States is faced with taking care of late
payments to the U.N. peacekeeping force, money that comes out of
the foreign aid bill, and with new payments to the International
Development Association, an arm of the World Bank. Additional money
will be needed to cope with increased flows of refugees around the
world.
   As new and more politically popular recipients line up at the
aid window, some of the world's most needy countries fear they will
get pushed even further back in the queue. Noted Rep. Lee Hamilton,
D-Ind., a senior Foreign Affairs Committee member, ``We've been
squeezing Africa for about as long as you can squeeze it.''
   Throughout Latin America, the growing scarcity of U.S. aid is a
top concern. ``They have just gone through a lost decade as far as
development is concerned,'' said Hellert. ``Are they going to go
through another one?''

   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured
goods reached their second highest level in November, the
government said Friday in a report that analysts saw as further
evidence the longest peacetime economic expansion is continuing.
   ``This confirms our expectations that the economy won't drop
into a recession,'' said Thomas Runiewicz, an economist with the
WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting organization. ``We're
going to see a slowdown, but no recession.''
   ``It pretty much conclusively demonstrates that we're not
heading into a recession,'' agreed Gordon Richards, economic policy
director for the National Association of Manufacturers.
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable manufactured goods jumped 2.4 percent, to a seasonally
adjusted $239.7 billion, after edging down 0.1 percent in October.
They had gained 1 percent in September.
   It was the highest level of orders since a record $239.9 billion
was posted in April and the fastest rate of increase since a 2.8
percent advance in August.
   The report was a bright spot in what has become a mixed picture
of the manufacturing economy.
   The Labor Department reported Friday that the manufacturing
sector lost another 25,000 jobs in December, raising to 195,000 the
number of factory jobs lost since March.
   However, orders for durable goods _ where much of the
manufacturing weakness has been concentrated _ posted a 4.8 percent
increase, to $130.2 billion, after a slip of 0.8 percent in
October. Increases were widespread within all the major categories.
   Runiewicz said that portends good news because factory orders
are a leading indicator and thus suggest future economic growth.
   Transportation orders jumped 10.6 percent, to $36.7 billion,
after a 1.9 percent gain in October. While aircraft orders totaled
$2.6 billion, or 62 percent of the advance, the slumping auto
industry posted a $1.5 billion gain.
   Excluding the transportation category, orders would have risen
1.1 percent.
   Other major durable goods categories recording gains included
electrical machinery, up 7.7 percent, most of it in defense
communication equipment; non-electrical machinery including
computers and a wide variety of industrial equipment, up 5.7
percent; and primary metals, up 2.2 percent.
   On the other hand, orders for non-durable goods that had been
the mainstay of the economy in recent months dropped 0.3 percent,
to $109.5 billion, after rising 0.6 percent in October.
   Richards described the turnaround as a statistical correction.
   ``It's pretty typical of economic statistics that when you see
deviations in one direction, chances are it's going to be a
fallback in the other direction at some point,'' he said.
   Defense orders rose 16.9 percent, to $11.2 billion, after
falling 10 percent in October. Excluding defense, orders would have
risen 1.8 percent.
   Analysts agreed that non-defense capital goods orders were
another positive in the November report because they are a
barometer of business investment plans. They were up 7.7 percent
after a 1.8 percent gain in October.

   Here is the transcript of President Bush's
news conference Friday:
   President Bush: Well, this morning I met with the attorney
general, Dick Thornburgh, to discuss the legal process related to
the prosecution of General Noriega. We are committed to a fair
trial and to providing all the protections guaranteed by the United
States Constitution and laws.
   The attorney general assures me that our case is strong, our
resolve is firm and our legal representations are sound. Our
government is not seeking a deal with Noriega. Our policy remains
that we have brought him to this country for prosecution.
   I will be ever mindful of this legal process in the days ahead
and will not comment on any aspect of this prosecution or any
matters that could even inadvertently affect the outcome of this
case, and I'm going to ask others in this administration to do the
same.
   Deputy Secretary of State Eagleburger and Deputy Secretary at
Treasury Robson have just given me a report on the economic
reconstruction efforts in Panama. The first action that the United
States took after General Noriega was removed from power was to
release some $400 million in money that was withheld by virtue of
our economic sanctions, sanctions which are now being lifted. $140
million I believe is already in Panama.
   The revitalization of the Panamanian economy is a major priority
in the months ahead as our efforts _ as are our efforts for
humanitarian assistance. And I would say here, I've been very
grateful for the medical supplies that have gone to Panama.
   I can report today that considerable progress has been made so
far in returning Panama to a normal state of affairs. The new
government has taken charge, and President Endara is working
tirelessly to meet the needs of his people.
   Both Undersecretary Robson and Eagleburger were very high in
their praise of Mr. Calderon, Mr. Ford and, of course, President
Endara. They are discussing housing programs, business development,
bank loans that will help spur economic growth. We are committed to
be a part of that process.
   I want to assure all of the countries of Latin America that
United States policy remains one of a friendly, supportive and
respectful neighbor. We have worked hard and intensively to consult
bilaterally and multilaterally with Latin America and we will
continue to do that.
   I personally will be involved in that. At the Latin American
summit in Costa Rica I pledged that we would work with the
countries of this hemisphere to build a better life for its
citizens. Our policy of cooperation is firm.
   Yesterday I had a lengthy discussion with Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez of Spain, who is so well respected in this hemisphere as
well. And I share his deep personal interest in seeing that the
countries of this hemisphere pull together on behalf of democracy
and economic freedom.
   I know the yearnings of my fellow leaders in this hemisphere _
leaders in Latin America _ and I believe they will support the new
government of Panama, and they will support the United States as we
work together in this hemisphere.
   And I've asked the vice president, Dan Quayle, to visit a number
of these Latin American countries within the next several weeks to
personally deliver this message. I view this as very, very
important diplomacy and I am determined not to neglect the
democracies in this hemisphere.
   Some have felt that we were so infatuated with the change in
Eastern Europe that we were in a process of neglecting this
hemisphere, and that is not the case. And the Quayle trip, in my
view, will help. I have been undertaking consultations directly
with leaders since I've been president.
   I will resume that, as I said, and the vice president will be in
a position to explain very clearly not only U.S. policy but our
aspirations for Panama and indeed, for this entire hemisphere.
   So that's where we are, and I'll be glad to take a few questions.

<HEAD>Probe Into Reopening of 1964 Civil Rights Workers' Deaths Is
Wrapping Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investigation on whether to reopen the
cases of three civil rights workers who were slain in rural
Mississippi in 1964 is nearly complete, the state attorney general
said.
   Attorney General Mike Moore declined, however, to discuss what
the probe has concluded. State officials, encouraged by the NAACP
and other groups, have sought to determine whether the case should
be reopened.
   ``The inquiry is continuing,'' Moore said Thursday. ``We've made
some pretty good progress.''
   The state legal official said the first question to be answered
would be whether the case could be retried and if that action would
be in the best interests of Mississippians.
   On June 21, 1964, civil rights workers James Earl Chaney, 21,
who was black, and Andrew Goodman, 20 and Michael Schwerner, 24,
who were white, disappeared after they were released from the
Neshoba County Jail in Philadelphia, Miss. They had been stopped
for speeding after investigating the burning of a black church by
the Ku Klux Klan.
   Their bodies were found 44 days later in a soggy earthen dam in
rural Neshoba County. All three had been shot to death.
   The men's deaths were the basis of the 1988 film ``Mississippi
Burning.''
   A U.S. District Court jury convicted seven Ku Klux Klan members
in 1967 of conspiring to deprive the workers of their civil rights.
Their sentences on the federal charges ranged from three to 10
years in prison. None was indicted or tried for murder in state
courts.
   Moore said the investigation by his office thus far reveals that
some of the alibi witnesses for those who were tried in 1967 have
died. That could allow defendants to raise a question of due
process in the courts becase of the passage of time, he said.
   ``There's been a lot of research done,'' Moore said. ``We're
working with the FBI.''
   Moore had originally hoped to make an announcement by the end of
1989, but he said he now plans to release the investigation's
findings sometime early this year.

   President Bush said today that some Americans
got the wrong impression that he ``didn't give a damn'' about U.S.
losses in Panama because television had shown him in a
``frivolous'' mood while split-screen TV carried pictures of GIs'
bodies being taken from a plane.
   At today's news conference, Bush took the unusual step of
appealing to the television networks to give him warning when they
use the split screen technique while he was conducting a news
conference. He said if a competing news event were so urgent as to
justify the use of that technique, he would stop the news
conference.
   ``I could understand why the viewers were concerned about
this,'' Bush said. ``They thought that their president at a solemn
moment like that didn't give a damn. And I do, I do, I feel it so
strongly.''
   Toward the end of his Dec. 21 news conference, a relaxed Bush
was seen on television bantering with reporters while, one by one,
the flag-draped coffins of Americans killed in the Panama operation
also were shown as they were carried from a just-arrived transport
plane at Dover Air Force Base, Del.
   It was evident to viewers that Bush was unaware of the image
that was going out to the country. The news conference was held in
late afternoon just one day after the Panama operation started. In
all, 23 American servicemen died during the U.S. intervention.
   ``I read a lot of mail after the last press conference and I had
some calls because when I was speaking here in this room,
juxtaposed against my frivilous comments at the time was some
split-screen technique which showed the bodies of dead soldiers in
caskets coming home,'' Bush said at the conclusion of today's
session.
   ``I would respectfully request that if the urgency of the moment
is such that that technique is going to be used, if I could be told
about it, that we stop the proceedings.
   ``So please help me with this if you would ,'' Bush said,
directing his appeal to the television networks.
   The Dec. 21 news conference ended with presidential press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater telling reporters to stay in the room to
receive Christmas presents. At the same time, honor guards in dress
uniform were still solemnly carrying coffins from the plane.

   Juanita Pierson and Albert Johnson were
just neighbors at the Oak Ridge Convalescent Center until the day
he asked her if she'd like to watch the news on television with him.
   ``He pulled my wheelchair over to the door of his room,''
Pierson said.
   With a smile, she added: ``I can't say it's been just to the
door since.''
   They were married Tuesday after a five-month courtship.
   Pierson, 79, is a lifelong Richmond resident who was married for
50 years. Johnson, 82, has lived here since 1924 and was married
for 52 years. Both are widowed, have five children and suffered
strokes that confine them to wheelchairs.
   ``We decided we needed each other,'' he said.
   Janice Spainhour, assistant director of nursing services, said
the staff has been watching the relationship grow.
   ``We knew there was a romance in the building and we all loved

   Tacky and glitzy or chic and ritzy, neon
lights up a new exhibit here in a state that's been called the neon
capital of the world with its blazing casino displays.
   ``There definitely was a time when neon was considered tacky,
kind of low life. But now it's tres chic and it's everywhere,''
said Erik Lauritzen, curator of the Nevada Historical Society
exhibit.
   ``People aren't just using it to advertise but they're using it
in art, as decoration and in architecture,'' he said Friday. ``It's
back in style. Look at just about any downtown area or shopping
mall.''
   The exhibit, which opens Jan. 19 at the Reno museum, includes
seven neon signs and art works and 50 photographs of glowing
displays, from the state's first neon sign documented in 1928 on a
grocery store in northeastern Nevada's Elko to the modern
hotel-casino extravaganzas several stories high.
   Neon signage has gone through several ``periods,'' according to
Lauritzen.
   ``The first stage was from the early '30s to the early '50s when
use of neon was very innovative,'' he said. ``Then the '50s to '70s
when neon was becoming just a way to advertise and kind of got a
bad rap. Then through the '70s and until now when neon is coming
back as art and decoration.''

   Candidates for general elections in May
include a popular pro-democracy leader now under house arrest and a
phalanx of veterans from the party that wielded authoritarian power
for 26 years.
   According to incomplete reports received Friday from the
Election Commission, 2,066 candidates from 96 political parties and
70 independents will vie for 492 parliamentary seats.
   Although Burma's military rulers ordered house arrest for Aung
San Suu Kyi, the charismatic pro-democracy leader has been allowed
to file a nomination to run in a constituency in Rangoon, the
capital.
   Ms. Suu Kyi, the daughter of independence hero Aung San, rose to
prominence in the fall of 1988 as millions of Burmese rose up
against a military-led government that suppressed political
freedoms and ruined the country's economy during its 26-year rule.
   The uprising was crushed violently by the military, and a
military council has ruled with martial law since then, but it
promised elections in May 1990. No date has been set.
   Many Western diplomats in Rangoon and Bangkok doubt the polling
will be fair and free, noting widespread arrests of political
opponents and human rights abuses in the past year.
   The only party capable of fielding candidates in all 492
constituencies is the National Unity Party, which under another
name was the sole political party in the country from 1962 until
1988.
   The party will field virtually all the prominent leaders of the
former ruling party, the Burma Socialist Program Party.
   Perhaps the most popular of the six national parties is Ms. Suu
Kyi's National League for Democracy. It built up a rapid base of
support but has been weakened by the arrests of top-level members,
including party chairman Tin Oo. He was sentenced to three years in
prison last month for allegedly inciting arrest and attempting to
divide the army.
   Similar accusations were made against Ms. Suu Kyi, but the
military rulers have not taken legal action against her although
she remains under house arrest in Rangoon.
   Others who filed nominations are popular leader Aung Gyi, of the
Union Nationals Democracy Party, and Chit Maung, chairman of the
largest leftist party, the Democratic Front for National
Reconstruction.
   Burma's last multiparty elections were in 1960. The elected
government of Prime Minister U Nu was overthrown in a 1962 coup led
by Gen. Ne Win.
   Ne Win and the military crushed dissent and pursued rigid
socialist policies that made resource-rich Burma one of the world's
poorest nations.
   Those economic woes and repression fueled the nationwide
protests in 1988 that forced the resignation of Ne Win and later
his successor, Sein Lwin.
   Maung Maung took power Aug. 19 as the country's first civilian
leader since 1962 and promised the elections.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: few questions.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President _
   A: Is it Helen first?
   Q: You said that the government is not seeking any kind of a
deal _
   A: Yeah.
   Q: _ concerning Noriega. Does that mean that you are irrevocably
ruling out any reducing of charges, increasing of charges? And
also, since the indictment runs from '81 to '86 and you had many
contacts, apparently, with Panama during that period, were you ever
aware of any drug activities on the part of Noriega?
   A: On the first part of the question, there's no such plan. The
man's entitled to do whatever is granted him under our law, so
there isn't any such plan. Secondly, I have made some statements
along in reply to your second question, so punch it in the
computer, and I'll have nothing more to say about it. Because I do
not want, even inadvertently, to prejudice this case. But it _ my
actions are, in my view, totally unrelated.
   Yeah, Tom.
   Q: Mr. President, with General Noriega out of Panama and safely
in custody in this country, it seems like you may have a difficult
choice in deciding how to maintain order in Panama. Do you envision
keeping a U.S. military peacekeeping force there beyond the usual
contingent of 12,000 troops, or would you like to see the
Panamanian Defense Forces reconstituted?
   A: One, I'd like to see their police forces, whatever emerges,
reconstituted. Two, we will get our forces that went in out as soon
as possible. Three, I will just say this because your question
obviously understands this, but to those listeners out there,
SOUTHCOM (Southern Command) has had a force there, and that force,
under the treaty, will remain there.
   But the answer is, we want to get those additional augmented
forces out as soon as possible. And we will.
   Q: Mr. President, I'd like to try to follow up a question you
were asked when you were here last about secrecy and the two
missions by General Scowcroft to China. As I'm sure you may be
aware, Secretary of State Baker was asked about the first _ what we
then thought was the first China mission on one of the weekend talk
shows. He indicated that it was, indeed. It turned out to be the
second.
   He has since acknowledged quite openly that his answer was
false, and that he felt constrained to give that answer to protect
the secrecy of the mission. And I wondered first, sir, whether you
felt it was worth it for him to have to do that, and second,
whether that sort of thing is acceptable in your administration.
   A: Well, let me simply say that some things will be conducted in
secrecy. And I know you don't like it _ your business is to get
everything out in the open, and my business is to conduct the
foreign affairs of this country in the way I think I was elected
to, and for the most part that'll be in the open.
   But this move into Panama was held in secrecy, and I think the
American people understand that. My move to send people to China
was controversial. Some think that the best way to make change for
human rights in China is isolation: Don't talk to them; try to
punish them by excommunication. I don't feel that way, and so I
asked these people to go forward. And I don't think Jim Baker would
ever deliberately mislead somebody. And so I will stand _ stand
with him.
   Q: Well, he _ sir, I believe he indicated that he felt he had to
do that, and that he knew what he was doing and he had to do it.
And I just wondered how you feel about _
   A: Well ask him about it. I support my secretary of state.
   Yeah, Lesley?

   A prosecutor known for accompanying
detectives on drug raids resigned after he was caught fabricating a
story that two men tried to assassinate him, the state attorney
general said today.
   Camden County Prosecutor Samuel Asbell, who shot out the windows
of his car New Year's Day and presented it as evidence of an
attack, has checked into a psychiatric facility, Attorney General
Peter N. Perretti said.
   ``The event was staged by Prosecutor Asbell, apparently acting
alone,'' Perretti said at a news conference.
   Asbell resigned Thursday night after he was confronted with
details of a state police investigation, Perretti said.
   He said there is no evidence that Asbell's ``sudden and
aberrational behavior'' has affected his work as prosecutor.
   Perretti said it appears several criminal laws were violated,
but a decision on filing charges against Asbell would depend upon
his psychiatric evaluation.
   Asbell held a news conference Tuesday to tell reporters he
barely escaped death when two man chased him for about four miles
through Camden's streets. When the gunmen opened fire, Asbell said,
he fired a 12-gauge sawed-off shotgun and a handgun that he kept in
his car, striking the passenger in the assailants' car.
   ``Thank God I'm alive,'' Asbell said. ``I guess it just wasn't
my day or my time.''
   Efforts to reach Asbell were unsuccessful today. His spokesman,
George Kerns, said he was not expected in the office today.
   Asbell had said his car was ambushed by two men in a station
wagon after he left his office about 5 p.m. Monday. He said he was
in his office on New Year's Day to catch up on paperwork and
collect his check after a vacation.
   He said the gunmen opened fire, and he was sprayed with glass
from his windows but was not seriously injured. He said he believed
the attack was drug-related.
   Camden, a rundown, mostly black city across the Delaware river
from southern Philadelphia, has a high rate of drug-related crime.
   Word of Asbell's apparent fabrication came on the same day
blacks in Boston were expressing outrage over news that inner-city
violence and a black man were unjustly blamed for the shooting of a
pregnant woman. The woman's husband, a well-off white businessman,
became the murder suspect and committed suicide Thursday.
   New Jersey authorities said they were confounded by a lack of
leads when they tried to investigate Asbell's story. No body was
found and the alleged victim did not turned up at local hospitals.
Asbell and his family were placed under 24-hour state police
protection.
   At a Thursday news conference, Asbell stood by his story.
   ``I have met with the attorney general, and he made it
explicitly clear to me that I am a victim ... of a violent crime.
He very kindly said I have to get (in) my mind the fact that I am
not a prosecutor in this matter, but I am a victim,'' Asbell said.
   Asbell, while in private practice, was shot in the chest in 1970
while representing a client whose property was put up for sheriff's
sale. The bullet is still lodged in his chest.
   Perretti appointed Assistant Attorney General James F. Mulvihil
as acting prosecutor in Camden County.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Attorney Robert L. Barr Jr., who prosecuted
former U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall and other public officials, announced
today he is resigning to become president of a conservative
public-interest law firm.
   Barr, whose four-year term as federal prosecutor for the
Northern District of Georgia would have expired next October,
called a news conference to confirm reports that he is quitting to
head the Atlanta-based Southeastern Legal Foundation Inc.
   He said his resignation, submitted to President Bush and
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh during a visit to Washington this
week, is effective Feb. 1.
   The 13-year-old business-oriented foundation, known for taking
on conservative causes, was involved in a successful lawsuit
against an Atlanta affirmative-action minority enterprise program
earlier this year. The foundation also has filed reverse
discrimination lawsuits.
   Barr, a former Cobb County Republican chairman, said he will be
active in politics but would not say if he plans to run for
political office.
   Barr, 41, was appointed federal prosecutor in 1986. During his
tenure, Barr's office successfully prosecuted Swindall, R-Ga., for
lying to a grand jury, and Fulton County Commissioners A. Reginald
Eaves and Chuck Williams and DeKalb County Commissioner John Evans

   Earlier this year, Barr's office won indictments against Fulton
County Sheriff Richard Lankford on 27 counts of extortion and
income tax evasion.

   Q: You talk about your concern about prejudicing the case, but
as you well know, you have called Noriega a ``thug'' and other
people in the administration have gone further.
   A: Yeah.
   Q: You said he's poisoning our children. Haven't you already
done that _
   A: Well I don't _ I think I've heard all kinds of
characterizations of him in the press _ columnists, even
commentators _ presidents, members of the United States Congress.
He is now in custody. The time for rhetoric is over. The time for
answering hypothetical questions that might prejudice the trial is
over.
   I would go back, Lesley, to help you on that, to Watergate where
there were hearings _ hearings held, charges made over and over
again, editorials written and voiced. And yet the people received a
fair trial.
   So I am convinced that our system of justice is so fair that the
person will _ will get a fair trial. But I can tell you from my
standpoint, I am going to bend over backwards and not answer
hypothetical questions or not do anything that might prejudice that.
   Yeah?
   Q: Can I have a follow-up please? On _ I want to actually
   follow up on Helen. On _- A: No, that's a separate question.
(Laughter.)
   Q: But it's a follow-up. Reducing of charges. Are you saying
that if he wants to go for that, he if wants to try to go for
reducing of charges that we will entertain it? You said _
   A: No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying he has a right to do what
he wants, and then let the legal process determine how that should
work out.
   Q: Then you're not ruling it out?
   A: Well I'm not ruling it in.
   Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President _
   A: I'm just saying he's got his rights and he ought _ we ought
not to stand up here and try to define narrowly what they are.
   (Calling on reporters.) Yeah, and then John and then we'll start
moving into the back.
   Q: Mr. President, based on your opening remarks and your
comments about the vice president's trip, it would indicate that
you're concerned about relations with Latin America. Has the action
that you've taken set it back?
   A: To some degree, I am concerned, because I am well aware of
how our friends south of our border, including my friend, President
Salinas (of Mexico), look at the use of American force anywhere. So
I'm concerned about it. I think it's something that's correctable,
because I think they know that I have tried a lot of consultation,
that we have exhausted the remedies in this particular case of
multilateral diplomacy.
   But given the history of the use of U.S. force, I would be
remiss if I didn't face up to the problem that we must go forward
diplomatically now to explain how this president looks at the
protection of American life, that we acted, in our view, well
within our rights, but that we will continue consultation.
   But, look, I feel strongly about the protection of American
life, so we've got to get them to understand that this isn't a
shift away from what some had termed ``excessively timid
diplomacy.''
   Q: What about _
   Q: But Mr. President, wouldn't that indicate that actually
you're _ we're continuing old American policies that have upset the
people of Latin America?
   A: Well, to the degree _ if there is that perception, then it's
up to me and the secretary. And in this instance, the vice
president's trip takes on enormous importance to convince the
people of the truth, and that is that we are not reverting to just,
you know, a willful _ what's the word I'm groping for here? _ use
of force that has no rationale.
   But when it comes to the protection of American life, please,
our friends south of the border, understand that this president is
going to protect it.
   I'll tell you one thing that's helped on this, to the degree
there is a problem at all, and that is the way the Panamanian
democracy is now starting to move forward. The certification of the
three people who had been deprived of their right to hold office by
the previous regime _ that's been of enormous help. And then I
think the other thing is the reception, the public reception in
Panama, for our action. It has been overwhelming, overwhelming.

<TEXT>
   Carhenge, the junk car sculpture that
spoofs England's prehistoric Stonehenge, has a better chance of
survival because of a City Council vote.
   The tourist attraction was threatened because its creator never
fully complied with a special use permit granted when he built it
outside this northwestern Nebraska town in 1987, officials said.
   The City Council voted Thursday to exempt the 10.6-acre site
from the city zoning boundaries. Councilman Mike Dafney said by
adjusting the boundary, the city dissociates itself from Carhenge,
built by James Reinders of Houston.
   ``It can get on with itself and try to survive by itself,'' he
said. ``But the city has no liability I can see or anything else.
We more or less are washing our hands with it as far as trying to
regulate it.''
   However, the City Planning Commission still has to approve the
change.
   The sculpture consists of old car bodies arranged in a likeness
of the famed Stonehenge in England.
   Reinders reportedly never fully complied with the permit, which
included requirements for liability insurance, a paved access, an
escrow account for maintenance and a parking area for visitors at
Carhenge.
   A group called Friends of Carhenge has been working to bring the
growing tourist attraction into compliance with the permit.

<TEXT>
   Socialism is not to blame for China's poverty,
and the nation will eventually triumph over its capitalist rivals,
the Communist Party daily newspaper said Friday.
   The lengthy commentary in the People's Daily came less than a
month after a small group of university students, in a bold gesture
of dissent, unfurled a banner in front of the state television
station reading ``Motherland, why are you so poor?''
   It is also part of a government propaganda campaign to convince
the populace that China must stick to the socialist road, suppress
political dissent and reject the reforms now sweeping East Europe.
   The Dec. 9 rally by Beijing University of Aeronautics students,
the first in the capital since the military crushed the
pro-democracy movement last spring, was not reported in the
official press.
   But Chinese sources said 10 seniors were arrested, including
three who were only indirectly involved in the demonstration. They
said one Chinese reporter who tried to stop police from hitting the
protesters was also detained.
   One source said a relative of one of the students was told he
was taken to Qincheng, a high-security prison where student
activists from the democracy movement are being held.
   The commentary, while not mentioning the protest, said many
young people are asking: ``If the socialist system is superior, why
is socialist China now so poor?''
   It acknowledged that a per capita income of about $300 a year
makes China one of the world's poor countries, with a rank below
100th in the world.
   But it attributed that to the nation's huge population of 1.1
billion, and noted that China ranks eighth in the world in gross
national product and is one of the world's leading political,
economic and military powers.
   It said the cost of goods is low, distribution of income is
equitable, calorie intake approaches world averages, and the
average lifespan is 69 years, compared to 63 in the world as a
whole.
   The daily said it was unfair to compare China to Japan or
Taiwan, saying the rapid postwar development of those capitalist
economies shows the inferiority of socialism.
   Both Japan and Taiwan, it said, started with more solid economic
bases and received substantial assistance from the United States.
Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists also carried off great quantities of
gold when they fled to Taiwan in 1949, it said.
   The commentary said China's economy grew 9.4 percent a year from
1967 to 1984, compared with 4.9 percent for the world's developing
countries, and that the gap with developed nations was shrinking.
   It also emphasized the moral superiority of socialism.
   Whatever happens, it said, quoting senior leader Deng Xiaoping,
``capitalism cannot cast off the super profits of the millionaires,
cannot break away from exploitation and plunder, cannot shake off
economic crises, cannot form a common ideal and morality and cannot
avoid every type of extreme and serious crime, degeneracy and
despair.''
   China is backward, it concluded, but ``there will be the day
when we approach, catch up with and surpass those developed
capitalist countries. Time belongs to us, and the final victory
belongs to us.''

   Both the prosecution and defense teams have
undergone major changes since the indictments of Panamanian Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega were handed up in Miami and Tampa.
   Richard Gregorie, who wrote the Feb. 4, 1988, Miami indictment,
left the U.S. attorney's office last year. He expressed concern
that he hasn't been asked for help from the current team, which has
no one who played a major role in the case.
   Gregorie, a 17-year prosecutor now in private practice, says he
left a very detailed memo about the Noriega case but has other
files and ``some in my head ... I'd be happy to share. I'm more
than happy to help the government in any way to make sure that the
prosecution is successful.''
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen declined to comment on Gregorie's
statements. His executive assistant, Diane Cossin, said a
seven-member prosecution team with a total of 40 years' experience
would handle the complex case, in which Noriega is charged with
allowing Panama to be used as a way station for cocaine, chemical
and money shipments.
   She said there were no plans to bring in Gregorie, former U.S.
Attorney Leon Kellner or Mark Schnapp, another assistant U.S.
attorney who helped with the indictment, as consultants.
   Charles Senatore, another former assistant U.S. attorney now in
private practice, said turnover makes it common for new prosecutors
to take over cases.
   ``It's a problem that happens a lot because a small percentage
of the people employed as assistant U.S. attorneys remain there
their entire careers,'' Senatore said. ``There's certainly enough
of a database remaining for the current team.''
   Lehtinen and Myles Malman, an assistant U.S. attorney with
experience in drug-related trials, are the lead prosecutors for now
and represented the government at Noriega's court appearance
Thursday.
   Then-President Reagan named Lehtinen on June 17, 1988, to
replace Kellner, who left for private practice in Washington. He
said Thursday he wouldn't comment on the Noriega case.
   In Tampa, where Noriega was indicted on drug bribery charges,
Robert Genzman has become the U.S. attorney, succeeding Robert
Merkle, who resigned after successfully prosecuting Colombian
cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas. Merkle lost a U.S. Senate bid
in 1988 and is in private practice in Clearwater.
   Lehtinen, 43, is a former state senator with federal prosecution
experience in Los Angeles and Miami.
   He has been a high-profile U.S. attorney, and last year raised
eyebrows by suing state water managers for allegedly failing to
protect the Everglades from polluted water flowing from Lake
Okeechobee. That suit is pending.
   Lehtinen's wife, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, won a special election
last August for the U.S. House seat left vacant by Rep. Claude
Pepper's death. She became the first Cuban-born U.S. representative.
   While Lehtinen hasn't tried a case in a decade, Malman has 15
years of prosecuting experience in New York and Miami.
   One of Noriega's original defense attorneys, nationally
prominent lawyer Neal Sonnett, withdrew last week, citing conflicts
with the other attorneys. Ray Takiff, another of Noreiga's Miami
attorneys, asked this week to withdraw because of health problems.
   Noriega's remaining attorneys are Frank Rubino and Steven Kollin.
   Rubino, 44, is a former Secret Service agent, ex-private eye and
a race car driver. Kollin, 41, was once a U.S. Treasury agent and
worked in the Dade County state attorney's office.
   Both have experience in drug-related trials, but some Miami
defense attorneys have said the complexity of Noriega's case and
its high profile may bring other, better-known attorneys.
   Sonnett, president of the National Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers, didn't rule out returning to Noriega's defense.
   The attorneys didn't answer questions about how they're being
paid. The United States has seized Noriega assets it has been able
to identify.

<HEAD>Albanian Envoy Denies Reports of Greek Deaths, Unrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Albanian ambasador on Friday denied
reports that four Greeks were tortured to death for trying to flee
the isolated country, and he said the pro-democracy movement in
Eastern Europe has not affected Albania.
   Ambassador Izedin Haidini showed a film that he said proved the
four Greek Prassas brothers were alive, contrary to allegations of
the Orthodox Church of Greece.
   However, no independent observer could verify that the four
young men shown exchanging New Year's greetings were the brothers.
   A Greek Foreign Ministry official said Greek diplomats based in
Tirana, the Albanian capital, were not permitted to leave the city
to verify that the Prassas brothers were alive in their village of
Pepel.
   Church officials have said the men were caught trying to flee
Albania for neighboring Greece in October and were tortured to
death.
   Albania is the last bastion of Stalinist Communism. The Orthodox
Church claims the country's 400,000 ethnic Greeks are denied human
rights, since they are banned from practicing their religion or
speaking Greek in public.
   The government of Albania, which incorporated Greece's northern
province of Northern Epirus in 1916, claims the Greek minority
enjoys special treatment.
   Haidini denied that diplomats or tourists with valid visas were
prevented from traveling throughout the heavily guarded country.
   Albania, sandwiched between Yugoslavia and Greece on the
Adriatic Sea, is one of the most isolated countries in the world,
with foreign visitors strictly limited and access to foreign
broadcasts and books tightly controlled.
   The ambassador also said that no unrest had occurred in Albania
as a result of the political upheaval that has toppled hard-line
Communist regimes across the East bloc.
   A man who claims to be Albania's true ruler was quoted as saying
Friday that leaflets calling for a revolution in Albania will be
attached to balloons and dropped into the country.
   ``We will broadcast messages by radio and drop leaflets by
balloon, something we have done before,'' said the man who calls
himself King Leka I. His comments appeared in the Johannesburg
newspaper Business Day.
   Leka is the son of self-syled King Zog I, who ruled Albania from
1925 to 1939. Leka, who lives in South Africa, was taken from his
homeland when he was 3 days old and has never returned.

<HEAD>One-Year Maximum Sentence Given in Slaying of Actress' Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Tongan man was sentenced today to a year
in prison, the maximum sentence for his conviction of misdemeanor
homicide in the death of the black son of a Hollywood actress in a
trial that sparked racial tension.
   John Leota also was ordered to pay restitution of more than
$40,000 for the death of Malik Smith, the 18-year-old son of
actress Beverly Todd and producer Kris Keiser.
   Third District Judge Homer Wilkinson's sentence was the maximum
for the charge of negligent homicide. Leota, 19, also was sentenced
to one year's probation and 150 hours of community service for an
assault charge involving another man.
   ``I just want to express how sorry I am to the family.'' Leota
said before sentencing. ``I know that what I did was wrong ... I
didn't know it was going to happen.''
   The emotionally charged sentencing hearing drew an outburst from
Todd, when defense attorney Phil Hansen told Wilkinson she had
``pulled the plug'' on the life-saving machine that kept her son's
body alive.
   ``That's a lie,'' Todd said, ``Why would he say that?'' She then
wept.
   Keiser emphasized that life support equipment was not removed
from Smith, of Los Angeles, until after two tests showed his son
was brain-dead.
   On Thursday, members of the Polynesian community here charged
that ``wealthy Hollywood blacks'' were trying to deny Leota justice.
   Entertainers such as Whoopi Goldberg and Jennifer Warren wrote
letters to Wilkinson to protest the misdemeanor conviction of a
defendant who was tried for second-degree murder.
   Smith was fatally injured when he struck his head after being
punched by Leota at a West Valley disco March 20. Leota testified
Smith had embarrassed him but he did not mean to kill him when he
hit him once and kicked him in the face.
   Surrounded by about 20 members of the Polynesian community,
attorneys Paul Schwenke, Filia Uipi and Victor Lawrence, a Samoan,
Tongan and Hawaiian, respectively, blasted ``wealthy Hollywood
blacks'' for ``trying to trample the civil rights of a John Leota.''
   ``These black entertainers who live in one of the most violent
areas of the world outside of Beirut _ L.A. County _ have the
arrogance to point their wealthy fingers at Utah and scream about
injustice,'' Schwenke said at a news conference Thursday.
   `We, the Polynesian community and citizens ofUtah, say to these
celebrities, Utah is a law-abiding state. We demand you let the
judicial process go forward. We do not want the legal process to be
influenced in any way,'' he said.
   A letter to the editor by Goldberg said she would ``spread the
word of the dangers that lurk in your beautiful state.''
   Schwenke did not feel there were racial issues surrounding the
crime, but that racial issues were generated by comments from the
victim's family.
   Upon sentencing, Wilkinson ordered Leota incarcerated in Salt
Lake County Jail.

   Q: On that, sir, Lee Atwater, the chairman of the RNC
(Republican National Committee), says Panama is a political jackpot
for you, and it will wipe out the disenchantment, for example, of
the way you handled China. Without saying that's why you went into
Panama, sending the troops in _
   A: Thank you. (Laughter.)
   Q: Isn't _ is one effect of it that it is a political jackpot?
   A: Well, Jesse Jackson doesn't think so. He talked to my wife.
And so, you know, there's differences of opinions on that, but this
isn't _ I didn't do something for political reason. That's not the
reason I did that. I did it to protect American lives. A
president's called on to take certain actions. We're not going in
to try to furbish a political image. That's ridiculous.
   Q: Having said that, though, have you now neutralized Democrats
on foreign policy? Is this the last time (Senate Democratic leader)
George Mitchell can ever accuse you of having a timid foreign
policy?
   A: Knowing George, he'll find a reason, he'll find a way. And
that's his job. I mean, look, we're going into an election year.
But this _ I want to try, if I can, to separate the responsive end.
He's been supportive of this. Let's give the man credit.
   Q: That's my point.
   A: But I don't think it's laid to rest, put off bounds, any
criticism of the president by a Democratic opposition, if that's
the question, no, absolutely not.
   Q: What about _
   A: Yeah, Frank, and then _
   Q: Mr. President?
   A: And then you're third.
   Go ahead.
   Q: Mr. President, do you anticipate that the combat troops, the
bulk of the additional combat troops sent into Panama, will indeed
be out by the end of this month, as some administration officials
have said?
   And secondly and more broadly, do you now see an expanded role
for the American military in small regional issues like this one,
or more particularly, in the war against drugs, since there was a
strong drug connection to this operation?
   A: No, I see no _ well, I see no parallel between the situation
here, where American lives were at stake and you had an indicted
person who'd usurped power and declared war against the United
States. I don't think you can draw a parallel between that unique
situation and then other countries.
   And what was the other part of it?
   Q: The bit about when you see America _ these additional combat
troops able to come home, all of them?
   A: As soon as possible, and I've made clear to the secretary of
defense, to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, who is down in Panama
right now, I believe, that this is what we should do. This is what
they themselves want to do. Some U.S. forces that went in are
already out. So, I would look for an early return.
   Q: General timeframe?
   A: Can't help you, but as soon as General Powell gets back,
we'll have a more _
   Dave?
   Q: What about the international law _
   A: Is your name Dave? (Laughing.)
   Q: _ implications?
   A: Go ahead.
   Q: What about the international law implications? Is this
something that you are also going to talk to the Latin American
countries _
   A: Absolutely.
   Q: _ (Off mike) _ a precedent? What is the explanation
   behind it?
   A: The right to protect American lives granted under the U.N.
Charter, and we will protect lives of citizens and we will go
forward with that. The State Department, as I understand it, has
already spelled that out, but I think you raise a good point. Yes,
we should make very clear why we acted and under what authority we
acted as we did.
   David?
   Q: Mr. President, you just described Panama as a unique case,
and I'd just like to ask you sort of a philosophical question. If
the criteria you listed here _ protecting American lives, having
exhausted all the other diplomatic options _ presented themselves
again, should we look in a Bush presidency for more such
deployments of military force, if your criteria were met?
   A: Well, yeah, if you can spell out what the criteria is and
then if you can _ if you can _ if you can look to the future to see
the situation surrounding it. I can't visualize another situation
quite this unique.
   But let me just say, when American life is threatened we _ we
were concerned in El Salvador, for example. A civilian hotel could
well have been occupied by a guerrilla force that would have
threatened the American use of _ threatened American life. That
concerned me.
   And indeed we moved forces, not in some macho way, but to try to
protect the lives of American citizens. But I think most people
understood that. But I don't see _ David, I don't see another real
parallel here looming on the horizon at all.

   The federal judge presiding over Panamanian Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega's case is a soft-spoken, patient jurist
rated one of the best by the attorneys who practice before him.
   U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler, 67, is known for giving
attorneys time to argue all of their points.
   ``Lawyers want to be heard,'' he said in a 1983 interview.
``Usually, if they feel they've been allowed an opportunity to
present their position, they'll leave thinking they got a fair
shake.''
   Facing a complicated case with the Noriega indictment, Hoeveler
made clear Thursday in Noriega's arraignment that he doesn't want
shortcuts.
   ``This is not a case I want to go by waivers,'' Hoeveler said,
ordering that Noriega be brought into the courtroom despite his
attorney's request that he be allowed to waive his initial
appearance.
   The 1977 Jimmy Carter appointee has presided over many lengthy,
complex federal cases, ranging from a marijuana-smuggling trial of
members of the Zion Coptic Church to jail overcrowding cases.
   Last year, the judge threatened to jail Broward County Sheriff
Nick Navarro for contempt of court after he disobeyed his wishes
and put inmates in a tent because the jail was full. Navarro, a
colorful, strong-willed lawman, wound up apologizing.
   ``If it wasn't clear before, I think it is now,'' Hoeveler said.
``I am in charge of this case and I expect the orders to be
followed without question.''
   The slim, white-haired tennis buff and his wife, Griffin, have
four children. He's a former Marine who studied at Temple
University and Bucknell and earned his law degree at Harvard.
   He is annually ranked the best or near-best federal judge by
Dade County lawyers and in 1983 was called the best district judge
in the three-state 11th U.S. Circuit by American Lawyer magazine.

<TEXT>
   Western politicians said Friday the
plan to hold elections in only three months could give the interim
leadership an unfair advantage, and they recommended international
supervision of the vote.
   U.S. Rep. Frank R. Wolf, R-Va., said Romania's new political
parties lack the ``tools of democracy,'' and proposed a referendum
on the election date. New parties have asked that elections be
delayed beyond April so they will have time to organize.
   Wolf and Otto Lambsdorff, both of whom were visiting Bucharest,
recommended international monitoring of the elections. Lambsdorff
is a former West German economics minister.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze was scheduled to
visit Bucharest on Saturday for the first meeting between the new
leaders and a ranking Soviet official.
   Silviu Brucan, a member of the National Salvation Front, said
Thursday the Soviets had promised extensive aid, including fuel for
the hard winter. The Front has governed Romania since the downfall
of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who was deposed Dec. 22
and executed Dec. 25.
   Lt. Gen. Victor Stanculescu, who is in charge of the economy for
the Front, said in an interview published Friday some trading
partners had agreed to accept exports of industrial products
instead of food. He did not name the countries, but food has been
one of Romania's exports to the Soviet Union.
   The interim leadership has stopped food exports and redirected
supplies to the nation's 23 million people, who endured rationing
for years as part of Ceausescu's successful plan to repay the
foreign debt.
   Its revolution appears to have brought Romania closer to the
Soviet Union, despite the collapse of the Communist Party.
Ceausescu often was at odds with the Kremlin on trade and foreign
policy, and rejected Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plans for economic and
social reform.
   Shevardnadze and Romanian leaders are expected discuss the
sensitive issue of Soviet Moldavia, one of several restive Soviet
regions. Most of the republic is former Romanian territory annexed
in 1940 under a secret protocol of the Hitler-Stalin pact of 1939.
   Moldavians, whose language is virtually identical to Romanian,
have demanded increased autonomy and Romania's revolution has
prompted speculation they may seek reunification.
   The National Salvation Front initially said it would not run
candidates in the April elections, but later reversed itself. The
half-dozen parties founded since the revolution have said they need
time to organize.
   Wolf said the Front's control of radio and television ``could be
a real concern'' in a campaign, and parties outside the Front
should be allowed access to the media.
   Without media access and scarce equipment such as typewriters
and copiers, the independent parties would be at a serious
disadvantage, Wolf said.
   Lambsdorff also expressed concern that the interim leadership
would have an edge, and said at a news conference: ``It would
perhaps be necessary to assure international supervision for the
results of the elections to be completely fair.''
   Wolf has visited Romania before and had pressed Congress,
because of human rights violatons, to revoke the Most Favored
Nation trade status granted Ceausescu's government.
   He suggested some form of international supervision and
recommended ``a national referendum in April to have a decision on
when the elections should be held.''
   A ``verifiable free election'' was ``very important to the U.S.
Congress,'' he said, and ``there needs to be a guarantee'' that
free elections and other promises of democratic change will be
carried out.
   Wolf said he expected the United States to have a ``warm and
close relationship'' with Romania and a ``high-ranking official''
would visit Bucharest. He gave no details.
   ``People have asked me, `Can I get a copy of the U.S.
Constitution? Another group asked me for paper _ tools of democracy
that maybe Thomas Jefferson would have asked for,'' he said.
   The congressman proposed that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and
National Association of Independent Businessmen organize a program
to teach management skills and free enterprise to Romanians.
   Stanculescu, the general managing the economy, said in an
interview with the daily Romania Libera that Ceausescu's regime
inflated production figures, and said the value of production and
exports were lower than reported.
   Exports last year were worth $392 million less than the official
total, the report said.
   Rompress, the national news agency, said Stanculescu's deputy,
Constantin Bostina, had been dismissed because of his association
with the Ceausescu regime.

<HEAD>Israeli Patrols Come Under Fire Near Jordanian Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>

   Israeli patrols came under fire twice Friday
along the Jordanian border, raising to four the number of shooting
incidents this week along the normally quiet frontier, the army
reported.
   The troops sustained no injuries, and the army was unable to
determine if there were casualties on the other side, said an army
official on condition of anonymity.
   The shootings occurred near the Hamat Gader sulfur springs park,
five miles east of the Sea of Galilee.
   Israel radio said a jeep in which an Israeli officer was
traveling was hit in the first incident, and the official said
shots were fired later from the Jordanian side on Israeli army
vehicles. Israeli troops returned fire both times.
   The radio and witnesses said that after the second incident,
army troops and police evacuated dozens of tourists who were
bathing in the area's hot sulfur springs.
   Jordanian troops were seen searching their side of the border
after the incident, they said.
   In Amman, a Jordanian official said on condition of anonymity
that Jordanian soldiers were unable to find any evidence of
shooting from their side of the border.
   On Monday, Israeli troops came under fire near the same area and
also suffered no casualties.
   On Thursday, Israeli soldiers opened fire on two men who
appeared to be attempting to infiltrate from Jordan about six miles
south of the sea. One of the men was wounded, the Israeli army said.
   There were seven incidents along the normally quiet Jordanian
border last year, six of them infiltrations, according to Israeli
army reports. The other incident, on Sept. 7, involved Katyusha
rockets fired at Israel from Jordan.
   Three Israeli soldiers were killed and at least seven soldiers
and civilians wounded in the incidents in 1989, the army said.

   President-elect Patricio Aylwin met
Friday with the commanders of the air force and national police and
asked them to stay on when the military ends its 16-year rule in
March.
   Gen. Fernando Matthei, the air force chief, and Gen. Rodolfo
Stange, national police director, are considered politically
moderate. Both advocate a return to the barracks and an exclusively
professional role for the military.
   The two are expected to mitigate the influence within the armed
forces of hard-line rightist Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who gives up
the presidency to Aylwin on March 11 but plans to retain command of
the powerful army. He has rejected a request from Aylwin that he
retire.
   Matthei and Stange, along with top aides, visited Aylwin
separately Friday at the president-elect's home in Santiago. Upon
leaving, each disclosed to reporters that Aylwin had asked him to
stay on.
   Matthei said he would postpone his planned retirement for a
year. He said Aylwin told him ``it would be good for the stability
of the country and to strengthen the beginnings of the new
government.''
   Stange previously had said he would stay on briefly, but on
Friday said he would remain as national police chief for up to four
years, which is the length of Aylwin's term. ``I told him that I'd
be pleased to stay on,'' Stange said.
   Pinochet seized power in a September 1973 coup that toppled
civilian President Salvador Allende. A clause in the country's 1980
constitution, crafted by his own administration, allows him to stay
on as army commander for eight more years.
   The same clause also shelters Matthei, Stange and navy chief
Adm. Jose Merino. But Merino, a hard-line rightist, has said he
plans to retire when the change in government takes place.
   Pinochet was obliged to call elections when voters rejected a
referendum proposal, in October 1988, that would have extended his
rule to 1997.
   Matthei was the first to recognize Pinochet's loss in the
referendum and, according to local news reports, was instrumental
in persuading Pinochet to accept the vote's outcome and call the
elections.
   Matthei and Stange also are believed to have had a moderating
influence in the four-man military junta that has served as a
legislature under Pinochet. The junta is made up of the navy, air
force and police commanders and an army general designated by
Pinochet.
   Aylwin, 71, the leader of a 17-party center-left coalition,
defeated Hernan Buchi, a former Pinochet finance minister, in the
election Dec. 14.
   On Thursday, the government and representatives of a pro-Aylwin
political coalition announced agreement on a new law establishing
the armed forces' authority under democracy. Pinochet had proposed
virtual autonomy for the military, but the agreement extended
civilian authority and trimmed the powers of a joint command.

   Sylvestor Stallone is going in for another
round of struggle and success in the boxing ring.
   Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young and company will begin filming
``Rocky V'' here Jan. 15, Mayor W. Wilson Goode announced Thursday.
   The new film will feature the familiar formula _ fighting,
winning with the boxing backdrop. Rocky Balboa, perhaps
Philadelphia's most famous resident since William Penn, faces his
greatest challenge, producers say, a test that will pit him against
his own values, strength and, ultimately, his own spirit.
   Boxing heavyweight contender Tommy Morrison is featured as
Rocky's protege, Tommy Gun. John Alvidsen, who directed the first
``Rocky'' in Philadelphia in 1975 with the then-unknown Stallone,
will direct the fourth sequel and filming is expected to last about
six weeks.

   Portions of Bruce Willis' ``Die Hard II'' will be
filmed at Stapleton International Airport, which has angered
airline officials who say it endorses terrorism.
   ``It involves terrorism, violence against airports, destruction
of an aircraft and a crash,'' Jack Ekey, general manager of United
Airlines' Denver operations, said Thursday.
   ``As a matter or principle, we don't believe that kind of thing
represents either airports or airlines in a way which we see
ourselves or want the public to see us,'' he said.
   Representatives of all airlines that use Stapleton lodged a
complaint last week with airport officials.
   Twentieth Century-Fox plans to start shooting the film at
Stapleton and in Weld County on Jan. 15.
   Greg Lazzaro, location manager of the film, said the airlines'
position is ``total, unadulterated bull,'' and ``preposterous and
stupid.''
   Ekey said the film script, which has not been shown to the
airlines, is the story of police officer's battle against
terrorists who try to take over Dulles International Airport in
suburban Washington, D.C.
   The plot of the sequel to ``Die Hard'' is heavy on wisecracks
and liberal in the use of automatic weapons and plastic explosives,
he said.

   Actress Martha Raye, the exuberant
73-year-old comedian known as the ``Big Mouth,'' broke several ribs
in a fall at home that forced a hospital stay, officials said
   Miss Raye was listed in fair condition Friday at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, said hospital spokesman Ron Wise. She fell on
Tuesday.
   ``We're not sure yet when she's going to be released yet, but I
don't expect it to be more than a few days,'' Wise said, adding
that she was in good spirits.
   Miss Raye worked in theater and in movies such as Charlie
Chaplin's ``Monsieur Verdoux,'' but is perhaps best known for
entertaining troops with Bob Hope. She did shows at military bases
during World War II, the Korean War and in Vietnam.
   Her morale-boosting efforts earned her presidential praise and a
special Academy Award in 1969.
   Most recently, she has appeared in TV commercials, capitalizing
on her widely elastic smile and nickname to promote a denture

   Filmmaker and art collector Billy Wilder said
his artworks were unharmed by the flames of a rampaging fire that
whipped through his apartment building last month.
   ``Nothing was lost. We just had smoke damage,'' Wilder said in a
recent interview.
   Inside the posh Westwood-area apartment he shares with his wife,
Audrey, were African sculptures, French primitives, drawings by
Saul Steinberg, pre-Columbian artifacts and more than 2,000 books,
he said.
   The Dec. 23 fire spread from a construction site to more than a
dozen nearby buildings as high winds blew embers over a wide area.
More than 150 people evacuated to escape the fire that caused an
estimated $25 million damage.
   Wilder would not disclose the value of his art collection.
   Wilder, 83, was a busy Hollywood film producer, director and
screenwriter during Hollywood's Golden Age. His feature film
credits include ``Double Indemnity'' in 1944, ``Some Like It Hot''
in 1959, ``The Apartment'' in 1960 and ``Irma la Douce'' in 1963.
   ``The Apartment'' earned him the Academy Award for best director.

   Former New York City mayor Edward Koch
says he feels like he has a ``whole new life'' now that he's out of
office.
   Koch launched the United Jewish Appeal here on Thursday, just
four days after he left his mayoral post.
   ``I have a whole new life,'' said Koch, who said he was starting
a diet and expected to make commercials if he's successful.
   Koch said he will keep busy as a member of a law firm, a
newspaper columnist, a television and radio commentator, a lecturer
and an adjunct professor at New York University.
   Koch spoke at Temple Beth El here, and also took the opportunity
to comment on events in Eastern Europe.
   ``Communism has failed and God has prevailed,'' Koch said.
   In his first newspaper column, published Friday in the New York
Post, Koch scored Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, accusing
him of saying ``the Jews in South Africa will pay'' if Israel fails
to support equality for South African blacks.
   Koch said Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, made the comment at
a dinner party with the then-mayor and about six other people some
years ago. Koch went on to accuse Tutu of unfairly criticizing
Israel last week, in remarks Koch called ``standard third-world
radical, and clearly an act of malice.''
   The ex-mayor also appared before reporters in New York on
Thursday to be a pitchman for a diet aid, saying he was using it
because ``I know I'm fat. I can tell you how I know I'm fat. I see
myself in the mirror, naked. Horrible.''

   Q: Mr. President?
   Q: Mr. President, back to the issue of China. Your decision to
send emissaries to China has carried some cost for you. Have you
seen any payoff yet? Have you had any response from the regime
there that is productive or encouraging for you?
   A: Well, it does carry some, and I think some who are familiar
with the situation have been quite supportive and some quite
critical. I will admit that. As I indicated, some favor isolation:
don't talk and let them come to us.
   I think one of the great things that happened to us is, you
know, under the Shanghai communique and, prior to that, is the fact
that we had a kind of contact and they began to see _ began to
facilitate our contact, help facilitate the changes and the reforms
that have taken place. So I want to see those go forward again. But
I _ is that responsive? I can't remember _
   Q: Well, let me ask you specifically, are we close to a
resolution on the issue of the dissidents or _
   A: I don't know the answer to that. I don't know the answer to
that. They know my position, and it is one of adherence to human
rights, I might add. The thing I object to about this whole one is
the assigning of motives to the other person.
   You can question the tactics, but I refuse to let my political
critics get me down in terms of they understand human rights and I
don't. I want to see, through the contacts that we've made, change
that can be manifested in several ways.
   Now, there has been some. The Voice of America, for example, now
permitted somebody to go _ is now _ you know, they have a person
permitted to go there. There's been a reiteration of sale of
missiles, which we _ are very much in our _ I think in interest of
peace in the world. So, there's been progress and, hopefully, I
would like to hope that there would be more.
   Yeah, Gerry? And then _ two. Two. Go ahead, Gerry and then you.
   Q: Mr. President, as you know, Mikhail Gorbachev has been
visiting the Baltics in his country to deal with the growing
independence or autonomy movement there. Have you encouraged him to
allow those movements to continue? Or do you consider that
essentially an internal affair for the Soviets?
   A: Well, he's got his own internal affairs, but he knows of our
_ our advocacy of peaceful change. And, to the man's credit, he has
been the big advocate of peaceful change. He has been the advocate
of reform. I mean, I _ you've got to link it, Gerry, to Eastern
Europe to some degree.
   And I realize _ and we can discuss this _ that the problems are
different. But give the credit that I don't think any of us a year
ago from this day would have given in terms of Soviet adherence to
_ Gorbachev adherence to _ change given the dynamic upheaval in
Eastern Europe.
   Now, he's facing problems inside the problems inside the borders
of the Soviet Union _ the Baltics, more recently this other one.
And he is _ keeps reiterating his conviction about peaceful change.
So, I support that. But, we did have an opportunity to discuss in
broad philosophical terms this question in _ at Malta.
   Q: Are you confident, as a result of that, there's not going to
be a crackdown?
   A: Well, I'm certainly not buying into the hypothesis that there
will. And I hope that he will _ that this approach that he has
taken, for which we give credit, will prevail.
   Yes?
   Q: Yes, Mr. President. Several times today you made reference to
the U.S. right to, and indeed your obligation to protect American
lives. Today, an American nun is being buried here in the United
States. Even the Catholic order she represented there in Nicaragua
claims that she was killed by Contra forces. What _
   A: They did say that? I'd heard there was _
   Q: Representatives of that group say that Contra forces have
been known to operate in that area using those tactics, that
perhaps they didn't recognize the pickup truck that they were
driving in. What do we know about who may have killed those nuns?
   A: Yeah.
   Q: And what are you doing to communicate to the Contra _ are you
trying to call them off?
   A: Well, we're not calling them off because we don't know they
were called on. And I'm interested in what you _ your hypothesis
because you're telling me that some have concluded that it was the
Contras. The Contras have denied that. Some have suggested it might
be the other side.
   The answer is: I deplore the loss of that nun's life, and
similarly, there were another that I believe was killed that was a
Nicaraguan there, and I deplore that loss of life.
   But, it is murky. It is extraordinarily murky, similarly _
similar to the situation in El Salvador. But I want to take this
opportunity to speak out against it. But we don't know the answer
to it. And in El Salvador, we said, ``Find out. We'll give you
whatever technical assistance we can.'' And we want to find the
answer to this question.
   Yeah, Ann?
   Q: Well, but, you're not confident then that the Contras didn't
commit _
   A: I don't know the answer to your question. They've said they
didn't; others are accusing them. And I don't know, and I don't
think our government knows. I'd share it with you if they did.
   Ann?
   Q: Mr. President, in Panama we saw women leading troops in
combat for the first time. Are you comfortable with women in that
role? And would you support changes in the restrictions on women in
combat?

   Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker has
a malignant kidney tumor and a decision on surgery will be made
soon, the official news agency ADN said Friday.
   Honecker, 77, was examined by doctors and found to be too ill to
be jailed while being investigated for alleged government
corruption.
   He was forced out of office on Oct. 18 under increasing pressure
from East German pro-democracy reform groups and a flood of young
skilled workers fleeing to West Germany.
   In December, officials announced that Honecker was under
investigation for corruption and had been placed under house arrest
because of his health.
   Seven former Communist Party Politburo members were jailed at
the same time and investigations against them for suspected
corruption also continue.
   Honecker underwent gallbladder surgery in August. ADN and other
East German media have said he has never fully recovered.
   Reform groups, including the 200,000-strong New Forum, allege
Honecker and other government leaders had lived in luxury in the
Wandlitz government housing area outside East Berlin, while normal
citizens were forced do make do with bare necessities.
   On Thursday, ADN said he had been released from house arrest
several weeks ago because no grounds were found to justify it. The
agency said he would be moved out of Wandlitz to a new home.

   A: No. I think this is a matter _ I'll willingly accept _ listen
to recommendations from the Defense Department, but these were not
combat assignments. But any time you have a highly trained gung-ho
volunteer force and they're caught up in some of the firefights

   A: Not equitable. Excuse me?

   A: Well, I'm confident _ they didn't seem overly enthused about
it, by Mr. Gerasimov's statement. But on the other hand, we _ I
don't agree with him at all. But, I don't think it's going to

been supportive of the invasion _ can you say if that is correct?
And then also because of that, do you think they've been
hypersensitive in their public statements about U.S. forces?
   A: I like to feel that, given the way the situation has
resolved, there is more support than has manifested itself in votes
at the United Nations or in public statements. The Vice President's
trip will help on this. My own consultations will help decide _ you
know, give me a clearer answer to your question.
   But, I _ I am absolutely convinced, given what happened and the
reason why it happened, that if there is damage, I can repair it;
we can repair it; State Department and whoever else is involved can
repair it.
   Q: But is it hypersensitive _ their reaction so far?
   A: Well, I think predictably so.
   Q: Mr. President?
   Q: Mr. President?
   A: Here's the last one. Way in the back.
   Q: Mr. President, some countries, with the precedent now of
Panama, feel that their sovereignty might be violated if the United
States pursues drug dealers in their countries. And there has been
some change in laws. Can _ you know, can it be reasonable that they
are worried about this in the sense of the CIA, the FBI going _
being able to apprehend people outside the United States territory.
   A: And so the question is what?
   Q: Do these countries have reason to be worried that the
precedent of Panama might serve as _
   A: Oh. Panama was more than that. Panama had clearly other
ingredients that caused American action. It wasn't a simple case of
going after a person who had been indicted for narcotics. You know
we had the abortion of democracy, but you also had this threat to
the lives of Americans.
   Let me do something in conclusion that may be a little risky,
and it's a housekeeping detail, and it relates mainly to television.
   I got a lot of mail after the last press conference, I had some
calls, because when I was speaking here in this room juxtaposed
against my frivolous comments at the time were some _ a
split-screen technique that showed American lives, the bodies of
dead soldiers in the caskets _ dead soldiers coming home. And all _
I would respectfully request that, if the urgency of the moment is
such that that technique is going to be used, if I could be told
about it and will stop the proceedings, or if it's something less
traumatic _ but that one, I could understand why the viewers were
concerned about this. They thought their President, at a solemn
moment like that, didn't give a damn _ and I do, I do. I feel it so
strongly. So, please, help me with that if you would.
   Thank you all very much.

   An engine that dropped off a Northwest
Airlines jetliner was found this afternoon on a wooded cattle farm
near this North Florida town, federal officials said.
   The 3,500-pound Pratt &amp; Whitney engine was spotted by a Madison
County sheriff's helicopter pilot and immediately secured until a
federal air safety investigator makes it to the site.
   ``It was roped off and we were told not to mess with it,'' said
Madison County sheriff's dispatcher Fred Register.
   Ted Lopatkiewicz, spokesman for the National Transportation
Safety Board in Washington, said the nearest inspector was
traveling more than 200 miles from Tampa and would not make it to
the site until close to nightfall.
   He said the engine would be inspected and then moved to the
nearest maintenance facility for further examination.
   Sheriff's deputies said the engine was found on the property of
a rancher who reported hearing a loud crash Thursday. Deputies were
not able to follow up on the tip until after heavy fog cleared late
this morning.
   The engine, one of three from a Boeing 727, fell off Thursday's
Flight 5 from Miami to Minneapolis. The flight diverted to Tampa
and landed safely with 139 passengers and six crew members on board.
   Officials believe the engine will provide the best evidence on
what caused the mishap.
   Investigators found the forward right lavatory had leaked
blue-tinted water over the outside of the aircraft. At the
35,000-foot altitude where the right tail-mounted engine fell off,
the fluid could have frozen and entered the intake of the engine,
an official said.
   ``That is a possibility,'' said Andrew Alston, a National
Transportation Safety Board investigator.
   But Boeing spokesman Tom Cole in Seattle noted that engines on a
727 are designed to break off if sudden vibrations threaten to tear
a plane apart, and the so-called ``blue ice'' could cause such
vibrations.
   ``Blue ice is a definite possibility,'' he said. Twice before
when engines fell off Boeing 727s _ on a Dallas-to-San Diego flight
in 1985 and on a flight over Sierra Blanca, Texas, in 1975 _
lavatory ice was raised as a possible cause, he said.
   ``It can do serious damage,'' Cole said. ``Chunks have been
found that weighed 10 to 15 pounds.''
   The flight crew initially believed the No. 3 engine had shut off
and they made several attempts to restart it, flying for several
minutes without realizing the engine had fallen off, Alston said.
   The crew ``all stated that they heard a loud noise and that the
plane yawed to the right,'' Alston said. ``They felt since there
was no massive pitching of the aircraft that the engine had just
shut down.''
   Investigators said the plane dropped about 100 feet in altitude
after losing the engine, but there were no major problems with
control, cabin pressure or hydraulics.
   Passengers said the flight was surprisingly smooth.
   ``We were amazed when we got out and saw an engine fell off,''
said passenger Mark Lawrence of LeSeur, Minn. ``Except for a bump
and a little dip, you couldn't feel a thing. Some passengers even
slept through it.''

<HEAD>U.S. Reassures Israel on Peace Talks, But Withholds Guarantees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is not pushing Israel to talk
to the PLO but is unwilling to meet Israel's demand for rigid
guarantees in advance of Middle East peace talks, a newspaper
reported Friday.
   The daily Yediot Aharanot quoted from a document it said was a
draft letter from U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III to
Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens. Israeli officials did not
confirm the existence of the letter.
   Baker has been working to get Israel to accept an Egyptian
invitation to open a dialogue with Palestinians as a step toward
Israel's plan for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   In November, the Israeli government accepted a five-point Baker
plan to facilitate the Egyptian meeting. But it demanded U.S.
``side assurances'' that the Palestine Liberation Organziation will
have no role and that the dialogue will be limited to Israel's
elections plan.
   Baker has urged that Arens and Egypt's foreign minister, Esmat
Abdel-Meguid, join him in preliminary talks in Washington, and
Israeli officials say the Washington meeting could come next month.
   According to Yediot, the Baker letter said ``the goal of the
United States, in the present effort, is not bringing Israel to a
dialogue with the PLO.''
   It continued, however, that the United States was not willing to
give assurances on what Palestinians would say at the meeting and
that delegates' in their opening statements ``would be free to
raise other issues and not limit themselves to elections.''
   ``These are the assurances that we plan to provide,'' Yediot
quoted the letter as saying. ``The president and myself are
convinced that these are enough to dispel Israel's worries and
allow progress in the (peace) process.''
   The draft letter reportedly was carried to Israel by Cabinet
Secretary Eliakim Rubinstein, who talked with State Department
officials in Washington last month.
   Yediot said that in addition to Arens, the draft letter was
given to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin and Finance Minister Shimon Peres. The newspaper did not say
how it obtained a copy.
   Avi Pazner, a Shamir adviser, said of the newspaper report:
``Many things there are not new, many things there are not
accurate.''
   He added: ``We are still engaged in a discussion with the United
States on the question of guarantees that the PLO will not be part
of the negotiating process. Until we have reached an agreement with
the Americans, we would prefer not to relate to all kinds of press
speculation.''
   Yediot said that Rubinstein, in a summary of his talks, advised
the Cabinet ministers that Baker wants to include two Palestinian
deportees in the delegation for the Cairo meeting, despite Israel's
demand that the delegates must come from the occupied lands.
   Egypt has suggested that including people deported from the
occupied territories would make the talks more acceptable to the
PLO, which has demanded it name the Palestinian delegates.
   In an interview on Israel radio Friday, Yossi Ben-Aharon,
director-general of the prime minister's office, indicated that
Israel was holding firm to its earlier conditions.
   Since the Palestinian uprising against occupation began two
years ago, at least 642 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
soldiers or civilians, and 43 Israelis have been slain by
Palestinians.
   Israel's elections plan is aimed at choosing Palestinians to
hold talks with Israel on limited autonomy in the occupied lands.
Palestinian leaders here have rejected the call, saying their goal
is an independent Palestinian state.

<HEAD>Militia War Drives 15,000 Villagers From Battleground</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   War between rival Shiite Moslem militias
in the hilly orchards of south Lebanon's apple country has driven
15,000 villagers to refuge in the mosques and schools of nearby
towns, police said Friday.
   While fighting raged in south Lebanon, President Elias Hrawi
prepared to establish headquarters in Moslem west Beirut, where his
predecessor was assassinated six weeks ago.
   Amal and Hezbollah miltiamen traded grenade and mortar fire for
the 14th day Friday in a struggle for supremacy among the 1.2
million Shiites, Lebanon's largest sect.
   Police said four people were killed and 12 wounded, raising the
toll to 77 killed and 275 wounded since the battle began Dec. 23
just south of Sidon, the provincial capital of south Lebanon, and
about 30 miles south of Beirut.
   The refugees sought shelter in Sidon and in Nabatiyeh, a market
town, police reported.
   Three members of a Palestinian guerrilla force that had tried to
disengage the combatants were reported among the wounded. Police
said they were caught in cross fire between Hezbollah, which is
loyal to Iran, and militiamen of the mainstream Amal, which Syria
supports.
   They were the first Palestinian casualties since 300 guerrillas
were deployed last weekend on a hill overlooking contested villages
in Iqlim al-Tuffah, the Apple Province.
   A police spokesman said the guerrillas Yasser Arafat's Fatah
faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization, did not shoot
back when they came under fire on Hamade Hill, which overlooks Kfar
Hatta.
   Amal militiamen who control the village repulsed two Hezbollah
assaults from nearby Kfar Milki, said the spokesman, who cannot be
named under police regulations.
   The two militias have fought intermittently since May 1987 and,
by police count, total casualties are 648 dead and 1,854 injured.
   Hezbollah renewed an offer Friday of an ``immediate and complete
cease-fire to be swiftly followed by negotiations.'' A Hezbollah
statement said fighting among Shiites was ``senseless'' and neither
side could win.
   There was no response from Amal. Its leader, Nabih Berri, has
said he would accept a cease-fire only when Hezbollah withdraw from
captured territory.
   Hrawi has been staying at an army barracks in the
Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of east Lebanon since Parliament
elected him Nov. 24 as part of a peace plan intended to end the
sectarian civil war, now nearly 15 years old.
   He plans to live and work in a seaside apartment building to
avoid commuting in west Beirut, where his predecessor, Rene
Mouawad, was killed by remote-controlled bomb Nov. 22. Hrawi is a
Maronite Catholic, as was Mouawad.
   The police spokesman said Friday that Hrawi would move to west
Beirut by the weekend, but ``the army and police haven't finished
security arrangements to protect the president during the trip.''
   Mouawad lived in the same seaside duplex, provided by Saudi
Arabian businessman Rafik Hariri, but had offices at the prime
ministry, a 10-minute drive away.
   He was being driven home from an Independence Day ceremony when
the car bomb exploded, killing him and 23 other people.
   A government official said privately that Hrawi ``will not leave
the building except for foreign trips. He wants to avoid risks.''
   The presidential palace in Baabda, a Christian suburb east of
Beirut, is occupied by Gen. Michel Aoun. The rebel Christian
commander refuses to recognize Hrawi and calls him a Syrian puppet.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League
mandate issued in 1976, the year after the civil war began.
   Aoun calls them an occupation army and the 20,000 Christian
troops he commands fought a six-month artillery war with the
Syrians last year.
   At least 929 people were killed and 2,744 wounded before the
Arab League arranged a cease-fire in September. Nearly all the
casualties were civilians.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov's mother has
died, Tass reported Friday in an unusual mention of a ruling
Politburo member's family affairs.
   The state-run news agency released a one-paragraph statement
saying the Politburo ``expresses deep sympathy for N.I. Ryzhkov on
the passing away of his mother, Alexandra Pavlovna Ryzhkova.''
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said
earlier this week that Ryzhkov's mother's illness might prevent him
from attending the Comecon meeting in Bulgaria on Jan. 9. There was
no word Friday on whether he would be present.
   The Comecon meeting promises to be a crucial one, with members
clamoring for an overhaul and Czechoslovakia reportedly planning to
propose that the East bloc economic alliance be disbanded.
   Czechoslovakia Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus said Thursday there
was no reason for Comecon to exist anymore, and he said his nation
would pull out unless the bloc is totally overhauled.
   Polish Foreign Trade Minister Marcin Swiecicki echoed Klaus'
views Friday, saying the alliance is outdated and should be
replaced by a less-rigid organization.
   Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn also said Friday that
Comecon needed ``radical reform.''
   The report of the death of Ryzhkov's mother went against the
Soviet custom of keeping leaders' personal affairs strictly
private. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's more relaxed style has
led to the lowering of the veil around leaders' lives somewhat.
   Politburo conservative Yegor K. Ligachev discussed his hobbies
with a Soviet weekly and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
admitted at a news conference that he wrote love poems in his youth.

<HEAD>Ceausescu Had Planned to Flee to China, Former Security Chief Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 9th graf pvs, A spokesman, to update arrival of

<TEXT>
   Executed Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu
once drafted an elaborate plan to flee to China and direct a
guerrilla war from there against anyone who tried to oust him, his
former head of security says.
   ``My job would have been to take Ceausescu out of Romania,'' Ion
Pacepa said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.
   The flight to China was part of what Ceausescu called ``Plan
M,'' which also called for the Securitate secret police to adopt
civilian disguises, retreat to hidden bunkers and wage guerrilla
war, Pacepa said in one of the few interviews he has given since
defecting in 1978.
   ``Ceausescu's refuge at that time was China, where he was to
live there as long as need be,'' said Pacepa. He declined to
disclose his current address, where he lives under an assumed name.
   Ceausescu, the last of the hardline Warsaw Pact bosses to fall
from power, kept close ties with officials in other conservative
communist countries, such as China and North Korea, as well as with
Islamic leaders in Iran.
   At the time of his defection, Pacepa was a two-star general and
acting head of Romanian external intelligence. In his book, ``Red
Horizons,'' he detailed Ceausescu's efforts to obtain Western
technology on behalf of Moscow.
   The book also chronicled the extravagant use of power and wealth
by Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, who were executed after a secret
trial on Christmas Day.
   Pacepa said he agreed to speak to the AP because his daughter,
Dana Damaceanu, her husband and two other relatives were being
escorted to safety from Romania by U.S. Rep. Frank A. Wolf, R-Va.
His daughter had been under virtual house arrest for a decade and
was arrested by the Securitate during the upheaval, he said.
   The group was arriving at Dulles International Airport near
Washington on Saturday, a day earlier than expected, said Charles
Lyons, a spokesman for Wolf.
   The contingency plan for Ceausescu to survive a rebellion, as
described by Pacepa, resembled what was occurring in Romania until
the fugitive leader was captured on Dec. 23.
   Officials of the provisional Romanian government said they
executed the Ceausescus because they feared the Securitate might
rescue them and because they wished to encourage pro-Ceausescu
forces to give up. Romanian television repeatedly broadcast footage
of the secret trial and the bodies of the executed Ceausescus to
prove they were dead.
   By the time Pacepa defected, Ceausescu had built miles of secret
tunnels linking his downtown palace to other buildings and to two
airports on the outskirts of Bucharest, the Romanian capital.
   Romanian radio reported during the uprising that the Securitate
retreated into a maze of secret tunnels, from which it was
launching attacks.
   As part of Plan M, said Pacepa, Romanian intelligence
established safe houses in West Germany and two neutral countries,
Austria and Switzerland, to ``give Ceausescu the means to wage a
guerrilla war from abroad.''
   The safe houses were occupied by Romanian ``illegals,''
Romanian-born agents who had documents saying they were natives of
the countries in which they were living. They used ``burst
transmitters'' to broadcast coded messages in brief transmissions
that are hard for intelligence agencies to detect, he said.
   ``There were a dozen radio stations to illegally communicate
with the Securitate in Romania and Ceausescu in China,'' he said.
   Pacepa cooperated with Western intelligence after he defected
and said most of the ``illegals'' had disappeared or were taken
into custody.
   Ceausescu's agents tried several times to kill Pacepa after his
defection, and they harassed and repeatedly arrested and beat his
daughter in Bucharest, he said. The threats and harassment worsened
after Radio Free Europe broadcast Pacepa's book over its
Romanian-language service, he said.
   The U.S.-funded radio station ``deserves a lot of the credit''
for toppling Ceausescu, said Pacepa. ``In Romania, people were not
able to watch West German or Austrian television'' as reformers
could in East Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. ``The only
source of information was Radio Free Europe, and they did a
marvelous job.''
   The Securitate numbered 10,000 agents when Ceausescu took power
in 1965, said Pacepa, and reportedly reached 180,000 by the time of
his ouster, about the same size as the regular army.
   ``Because he did not have confidence in the army, he built his
own army,'' said Pacepa. In the end, the Romanian army revolted and
defeated the Securitate.

<HEAD>Jobless Rate Holds Steady; Manufacturing Jobs Drop Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's unemployment rate held steady at
5.3 percent last month as gains in service industries offset the
ninth consecutive monthly drop in manufacturing jobs, the Labor
Department said Friday.
   The steady civilian jobless rate, which ended 1989 just under
the level where it began, gave private analysts hope that the
economy's current sluggish growth will not worsen into a recession.
   ``That's a good number and it certainly suggests that the
economy isn't falling out of bed,'' said Robert Dederick, chief
economist for the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   In other good economic news, the Commerce Department said Friday
that orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods, which have
been lackluster in recent months, shot up 2.4 percent in November
to a seasonally adjusted $239.7 billion, their best showing since
April.
   The increased demand was widespread across most industries, led
by another big jump in orders for aircraft. Economists said the
rise in orders, if it continues in coming months, should halt the
slide in manufacturing employment, probably by the middle of next
year.
   Analysts were still concerned that the slowdown in the overall
economy, which many feared would last until the spring, would
translate into higher jobless rates in the months ahead.
   ``There definitely is some weakness out there in the land. ...
The steady growth of the service industry is what's keeping us from
slipping into a recession,'' said economist Cynthia Latta of
DRI-McGraw Hill.
   During all of last year, the unemployment rate fluctuated in a
narrow range within a tenth of a percentage point of 5.3 percent,
except for March when it dipped to a 15-year low of 5 percent. The
average for the year was 5.3 percent.
   Based on a workplace survey, manufacturing industries lost
another 25,000 jobs in December, bringing factory job losses since
March to 195,000. U.S. manufacturing suffered in 1989 with
widespread layoffs in auto plants and other factories producing
big-ticket consumer goods.
   This job loss has not been enough to pull the country into a
recession because of a continued boom in the service sector, where
most Americans are employed.
   In December, the service sector added 206,000 jobs, bringing
total job growth for the year to 2.4 million.
   ``There's a kind of tug of war going on to see whether (service
industry increases) will pull ahead of the manufacturing losses,''
said Pierre Ellis, an economist at the Boston Co.
   The addition of 142,000 non-farm jobs in December was not
considered a particularly strong advance, given that it was
artificially inflated with the return of about 55,000 striking
telephone workers in New York.
   Some analysts were concerned by a 0.6 percent rise in average
hourly earnings in December, which would translate into wage gains
above 7 percent if it persisted for a year.
   However, other analysts dismissed the jump as a one-month
aberration and not a signal that wage pressures were threatening to
set off an inflationary spiral. They noted that the 4.1 percent
increase in hourly wages over the past year was still under
consumer price inflation, which has been increasing by 4.5 percent.
   The Labor Department on Friday revised the November unemployment
rate to 5.3 percent, which it had earlier reported as 5.4 percent.
   According to a household survey by the department, the economy
produced 1.7 million new jobs during 1989, bringing the civilian
work force to 117.9 million. That was down from job gains of 2.3
million in 1988.
   Construction jobs fell by 38,000 in December with analysts
attributing the drop to the deep freeze that gripped most of the
nation last month.
   Transportation employers added 73,000 jobs on a seasonally
adjusted basis last month. Business services added 14,000; health
services, 47,000; government, 34,000; and finance, insurance and
real estate, 13,000. Retail employment grew by 12,000 fewer jobs
than the normally expected seasonal gain.
   In a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of
the armed services stationed in the United States, the December
jobless rate was unchanged at 5.3 percent, the same as the civilian
rate.

<TEXT>
   To residents of this city on the Soviet
border, Romania's new leader Ion Iliescu is a caring man capable of
ending their nation's quarter-century of despair.
   Iliescu had clashed with dictator Nicolae Ceausescu before his
posting as the city's Communist Party chief in 1974-76. The job was
one of several demotions for Iliescu, who emerged as leader of the
revolution that last month toppled and executed Ceausescu.
   Through a filter of suffering and revolution, the people of Iasi
see in Iliescu not only a talented economist, but a man who cares
about people and culture.
   ``He was the only local party secretary who didn't treat
Ceausescu like a king,'' said Adi Cristi, a poet and member of the
National Salvation Front committee that now runs the city of
300,000 people.
   ``I think Mr. Iliescu will restore liberty and the possibility
to say anything you think,'' said Pavel Zaharia, who waited on
Iliescu's table 15 years ago and now manages a hotel in the city.
   There is also praise from those on the Soviet side of the border
who worked with Iliescu.
   Mikhail S. Platon, a deputy premier of the Soviet republic of
Moldavia across the Prut River, was a local party official in the
border region when Iliescu was in charge in Iasi.
   Among Soviets, Platon said in an interview, Iliescu had a
reputation as ``an energetic, businesslike, thoughtful and
progressive person.''
   As a hydrologist, he concentrated on land improvements in an
area where a lack of rainfall inhibits otherwise favorable growing
conditions, Platon said.
   Iliescu studied at Moscow State University, and much has been
made of the fact that he was a student there at the same time as
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. It is unclear, however, whether he
actually knew Gorbachev.
   But Platon said that by temperament and conviction, the
59-year-old Iliescu is close to Gorbachev.
   ``By nature he is a good mixer, he likes to be with the
people,'' he said. ``He saw the difficulties and the hardships of
their lives.''
   Iliescu reached his peak under Ceausescu as a member of the
Central Committee and the minister of youth affairs in 1967-72, but
then progressively fell into disfavor until he was named the head
of a technical publishing house, the job he held until he announced
the arrest of Ceausescu on national TV on Dec. 23.
   It is not known whether Iliescu took part in organizing the
revolt before he appeared on television.
   Despite his demotion, observers in Bucharest say he was one of
the few Romanians who had the stature and experience to rally the
country against the dictator.
   He is president of the revolutionary Council of the National
Salvation Front, and has pledged to guide the country toward free
elections in April.
   He has announced the reintroduction of private property,
abolished the death penalty and signed a decree establishing the
basis of a multiparty system.
   With the fall of Ceausescu, the Romanian Communist Party
virtually has ceased to exist. Other top officials of the National
Salvation Front have said they no longer consider themselves
Communists.
   Iliescu showed his economic prowess with documents and numbers
rather than ideological bluster, the new Iasi officials said.
   The president of the local Salvation Front, Doru Tigau, recalled
a speech on sugar production in which Iliescu compared the
efficiency of a local factory with that of factories in Italy,
France and other countries. ``He never appeared before people
without documents,'' Tigau said.
   Another time in Iasi, in what was then a feat of daring, Iliescu
made an official speech that lasted several hours and only
mentioned Ceausescu once, Tigau recalled.
   He referred to him as ``Comrade Ceausescu'' instead of preceding
Ceausescu's name with all of the former leader's titles, as was
customary at the time.
   Iliescu's unorthodox style was evident in his approach to the
arts as well, Iasi's new officials said.
   ``He protected the arts without taking political nuances into
account,'' Tigau said.
   Cristi said Iliescu built a library and a children's and youth
theater that is the only one of its kind in Romania.
   Iasi residents said what they saw of him in the 1970s convinces
them that Iliescu should be given a chance to be elected president.
   ``There's no other choice,'' said Marius Frangiliu, a
25-year-old student.

   The Justice Department said Friday that it
spent $224,000 on a futile attempt to identify the source of an
unauthorized disclosure of a preliminary criminal investigation
involving Rep. William H. Gray III.
   The department conducted a five-month investigation to determine
who leaked information that the FBI was investigating alleged
financial irregularities in Gray's congressional office.
   An initial CBS-TV story that Gray was the subject of the
preliminary investigation prompted a storm of accusations from
Democrats on Capitol Hill that the Republican-run Justice
Department was trying to smear the Pennsylvania Democrat with news
leaks.
   The department quickly took the unusual step of issuing a
statement that Gray was not a target and was cooperating with FBI
agents.
   The CBS story was particularly embarrassing for Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh because it was aired as Gray was seeking election
as House majority whip, a job he later won. Thornburgh ordered an
investigation of the unauthorized leak.
   The $224,000 included the salaries and travel expenses of 11 FBI
agents, as well as prosecutors and support personnel, Runkel said.
   Agents took sworn statements from 109 Justice Department and FBI
employees and 10 were asked to take polygraph tests, the department
said.
   The investigation was conducted with money already available for
that purpose, Runkel said.
   During the investigation, the Justice Department told Congress
that it had changed its longstanding policy barring prosecution of
government officials for unauthorized disclosure of sensitive
information.
   Under the new policy, officials could be prosecuted for
conversion or theft of government property by making an
unauthorized disclosure of information about a criminal
investigation. The charge carries a maximum 10-year sentence.
   But Thornburgh said last week in a letter to Congress that there
would be no prosecutions or disciplinary action because the
investigation of the Gray leak was ``unable to identify with
certainty the original source'' of the disclosure.

   Officials from both German nations announced
a multibillion-dollar project Friday to renovate crumbling cities
in East Germany and provide more and better housing for people on
both sides of the border.
   Also Friday, East German's official news agency reported that
ousted Communist leader Erich Honecker, who faces corruption
charges, is too ill to be jailed and needs surgery to remove a
kidney tumor.
   The first beneficiaries of the joint renovation project will be
the East German cities of Meissen, Weimar, Brandenburg and
Stralsund.
   Those cities and many other urban areas of East Germany require
major restoration following damage during World War II.
   General neglect under a socialist system that gave priority to
industry over living conditions, and the devastating effects of the
brown-coal haze choking major cities, have contributed to their
deterioration.
   West Germany's construction minister, Gerda Hasselfeldt, said
Bonn will contribute $4 billion to the project in the next two
years.
   Ms. Hasselfeldt and East Germany's minister for construction and
housing, Gerhard Baumgaertel, said the reconstruction of the four
cities will be the pilot project for cooperation between the German
states.
   ``It is my hope that by pursuing all means of improving housing
and construction in this country, that our housing market can be
eased as well,'' Ms. Hasselfeldt said.
   East Germany suffers a serious housing shortage because many
residential buildings are unfit for habitation.
   West Germany's housing problem is due more to a lack of space
and the high cost of construction.
   Tens of thousands of apartments in East Berlin are empty because
of last fall's exodus to the West of disgruntled East Germans.
   If the apartments were upgraded to Western standards,
arrangements could be made to rent some of the space to West
Berliners, who are short at least 50,000 homes in their crowded
city of 2.1 million people.
   Ms. Hasselfeldt said more incentive for ``private ownership and
individual responsibility'' was needed to ensure the joint projects
succeed.
   She said West Germany was not putting any conditions on the
financial and technical aid it will give to the renovation but said
the projects ``cannot function successfully without structural
changes'' in the East German economy.
   The new chairman of West Germany's Deutsche Bank visited East
Berlin on Friday, but no details of the talks were disclosed.
Deutsche Bank is expected to play an important role in turning
around East Germany's stagnant economy after 40 years of socialist
mismanagement.
   Communist Premier Hans Modrow has called for limited steps to
attract foreign investment and encourage some private enterprise.
His plan for guiding the nation out of its economic morass is to be
disclosed next week.
   Modrow became premier during the pro-democracy movement that
resulted in Honecker's ouster Oct. 18.
   Honecker, 77, has been in seclusion at a former Communist Party
estate since Oct. 18, but he must be moved from the compound by the
end of the month as it is to be converted to a state home for the
handicapped.
   The official ADN news agency said Thursday that doctors had
asked to examine him to determine if he could be imprisoned pending
investigation of corruption charges. On Friday, ADN said Honecker
was too ill to be jailed.
   Another new opposition group announced its formation Friday. The
pro-Western party calls itself the Social Citizens Union of Germany
and advocates reunification with West Germany and transition to a
full market economy.
   Most other pro-democracy groups are pressing for closer ties
with West Germany but retention of East German sovereignty.
National elections are scheduled in May.

<HEAD>President Supports Baker On Statements About Secret Trips To

   President Bush stood by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III on Friday in a failed attempt to keep secret a
July visit to Beijing by two senior U.S. officials.
   After the trip became known last month, Baker acknowledged he
may have been misleading in saying that a trip earlier that month
to China by Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security
assistant, and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger was
their first mission to Beijing.
   Baker said his intention had been to protect the president and
his policy.
   The trips, for talks with Chinese leaders, were criticized in
Congress and elsewhere as undercutting U.S. disapproval of China's
bloody crackdown of pro-democracy forces and Bush's own policy of
moderate punitive sanctions against the Chinese government.
   Bush, responding to a question at a White House news conference,
began by saying ``some things will be conducted in secrecy,'' then
told reporters:
   ``I know you don't like it. Your business is to get everything
out in the open and my business is to conduct the foreign affairs
of this country in the way I think I was elected to... .
   He acknowledged that the missions to China were
``controversial'' and that ``some think the best way to make change
for human rights in China is isolation.''
   Bush said, however, that he had not chosen the path of
``excommunication'' of the Chinese leaders.
   As for the inaccurate statement by Baker that the December trip
by Scowcroft and Eagleburger to Beijing in December had been their
first, Bush said:
   ``I don't think Jim Baker would ever deliberately mislead
somebody. And so I will stand _ stand with him.''
   Pressed about Baker's explanation that his intention had been to
protect Bush, the president cut the questioner off.
   ``Ask him about it,'' Bush said. ``I support my secretary of
state.''
   Asked what the visits had accomplished, the president said the
Voice of America had been permitted to send a new bureau chief to
Beijing. Her predecessor was ousted during the June 3-4 crackdown
in which hundreds of protesters were killed by Chinese troops.
   In defense of his overtures, Bush also cited a reported decision
by China to end missile sales to Middle Eastern countries.

   Baptists, probably the most oppressed
worshipers under Nicolae Ceausescu, are professing their faith
openly for the first time since the dictator's relentless
persecution stifled them decades ago.
   ``Numerous people from all walks of life, including many army
officers and soldiers, have been coming here in the past few days
to tell us how afraid they had been in the past to say they were
believers,'' the Rev. Ilie Tundrea of Bucharest's Bethany Baptist
Church said Friday.
   As in other countries with rigid Communist regimes, believers
were considered unreliable citizens, not allowed to hold leading
positions in an officially atheist system.
   No religion was encouraged, but Tundrea said in an interview
``it was worse for Protestants, because the authorities could not
tolerate our evangelical activity.''
   Ceausescu was overthrown Dec. 22, and the first large Baptist
gathering was held Dec. 31 in Oradea, northwestern Romania. About
10,000 worshipers packed a sports arena with the approval of the
new authorities.
   For the first time since the Communist takeover in 1947, state
radio and TV broadcast a live Christmas service from the Patriarhie
Cathedral in Bucharest.
   In recent annual U.S. State Department reports on human rights,
the Ceausescu regime ranked among the worst offenders. It was
accused of running a police state with no freedom of expression,
and religious tolerance only for such recognized faiths as the
Romanian Orthodox or Jews.
   Baptist pastors were denied permission to preach and arrested
for distributing Bibles. The Communists never recognized the Roman
Catholic church because the Catholic bishops refused to recognize
the supremacy of the state.
   About 80 percent of Romania's 23 million people are believed to
be nominal followers of the Orthodox faith and 6 percent are Roman
Catholics.
   Romania has about 300,000 Baptists, up from 60,000 two decades
ago. Most of the Baptists, Pentecostals, Seventh-day Adventists and
other Protestants are in the western Transylvania region and in
Bucharest.
   Under Ceausescu, who ruled Romania for 24 years, the Baptist
Church was given special attention because its rapid growth was
seen as a threat.
   The Romanian Orthodox church was treated more leniently because
it generally limited itself to such traditional ceremonies as Mass,
marriages and funerals.
   ``Securitate officers were present at every single service to
record what was being preached and we were forbidden from
baptizing,'' Tundrea said, referring to the Ceausescu's secret
police.
   He said police cars always were parked outside the church and
the telephones of leading Baptists were tapped.
   Believers who refused to become informers were harassed at work
and ``many were jailed for years after they were accused of being
servants of Western capitalism,'' the pastor said.
   Official reaction to construction of a church in Comanesti, 135
miles north of Bucharest, illustrated the hardships Baptists faced
under Ceausescu.
   The building was torn down in 1989 after authorities accused
local church leaders of ``stealing construction materials and other
socialist property,'' and four were imprisoned. They were released
after the revolution.
   Lack of Bibles and other Christian books forbidden in Romania
was partially overcome through the efforts of missionaries from
Western Europe and the United States, who imported the books in
special hidden compartments in their vans, Tundrea said.
   Pastors often were summoned for interrogation by the security
police and were even forbidden to preach from specific sections of
the Bible.
   They could not mention the Book of Revelations ``because it
speaks of the second coming of Christ; this Ceausescu did not
accept,'' Tundrea said while helping unload a Dutch truck bringing
food aid for distribution by his church.
   In 1977, a group of pastors wrote a letter to Ceausescu
complaining about persecution in the country, Tundrea said.
   ``After that, every one of us was interrogated each day for six
weeks,'' he said in a whisper, then laughed and said aloud: ``You
see, I am still living in the era before the revolution.''
   ``For us, the revolution was a miracle. We can now be free to
participate'' in a ``Christian revival in Romania,'' the pastor
said.
   ``I believe ... we will have opportunity to print Bibles and
magazines, establish new contacts and organize evangelical
activities, because people feel such a big hunger for them now.''

<HEAD>Must Judges Warn People on Perils of Legal Self-Defense? Maine
Court Says No</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge is not required to warn a
defendant that he could be making a mistake by serving as his own
lawyer, Maine's highest court has ruled.
   The ruling by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court came in the
appeal of a former policeman with a ``strongly held dislike for
attorneys'' who was convicted of having sex with a child.
   Former state Trooper Richard Morrison was charged with having
sex with a 13-year-old baby sitter in 1985. He defended himself at
trial, lost the case, then hired a lawyer and appealed his
conviction on grounds that he had inadequate legal representation.
   Johnson was in jail after surrendering following Thursday's 4-2
ruling. He was sentenced to 10 years.
   A popular saying among lawyers is that a person who acts as his
own attorney has ``a fool for a client.'' The gist of Morrison's
appeal was that the judge should have warned him how foolish he was.
   His lawyer, Peter B. Bickerman, said he would meet with Morrison
before determining whether to appeal the Maine ruling to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   ``It's generally believed that the judge should give some kind
of warning'' to defendants who act as their own lawyer, Bickerman
said. But Bickerman said guidelines for such warnings have never
been firmly laid out.
   The court majority said Morrison had no right to a new trial
because, before his trial, he had been warned by family, friends
and even the prosecutor that he should get an attorney. Morrison's
wife contacted a lawyer, ``only to have Morrison become angry with
her and refuse the lawyer's help,'' said the majority opinion
written by Chief Justice Vincent L. McKusick.
   ``Morrison had a strongly held dislike for attorneys, and
despite repeated warnings he never budged from his early decision
to conduct his own defense at trial,'' McKusick wrote.
   The justices said they were refusing to create a rule that would
throw out convictions of people who represent themselves ``if the
trial court failed to give the defendant Miranda-like warnings of
the risks of self-representation and the benefits of counsel on the
record.''
   Miranda is the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling that requires
police to read suspects their rights.
   The two dissenting justices said Morrison should have received
more than warnings from his wife and fellow troopers.
   They noted that the trial judge informed Morrison of his
constitutional right to a lawyer and determined Morrison was able
to afford a lawyer, but he did not warn Morrison about the dangers
of self-representation.
   The dissenting opinion also quoted from a California case in
which the U.S. Supreme Court held that defendants who represent
themselves ``should be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages
of self-representation, so that the record will establish that `he
knows what he is doing and his choice is made with his eyes open.'''
   Morrison was convicted of rape, gross sexual misconduct,
unlawful sexual contact and assault. Thursday's ruling dismissed
the conviction on the unlawful sexual contact count, saying the
prosecution had inadequate evidence on that charge. That did not
change Morrison's 10-year prison sentence, Bickerman said.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Maynard Jackson and Martin Luther King
Jr.'s widow Friday urged Atlantans to ignore a Ku Klux Klan rally
planned at the state Capitol on Saturday.
   A white supremacist rally and march in downtown Atlanta a year
ago turned violent as thousands of counterdemonstrators gathered to
oppose a handful of white suprematist protesters.
   Jackson joined Coretta Scott King for a news conference
outlining events for the city's King Week celebration, which runs
Sunday through Jan. 15, Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
   ``The Klan rally is not worthy of your attention,'' Jackson
said. ``Stay home, go shopping, rake leaves ... do whatever you do
on Saturdays. There's no sense in wasting your time on that. Leave
them alone, and let them say what they have to say _ to each
other.''
   ``That would be a good thing to do,'' agreed Mrs. King,
president of the King Center. ``It would be much better if people
stayed away.''
   Mrs. King said she and the center ``believe in the First
Amendment privileges of all people. But we certainly don't agree
with the philosophy of the Klan.''
   The Southern White Knights of the KKK plan a morning
demonstration at the state Capitol and an afternoon rally in
Forsyth County, the virtually all-white county north of Atlanta
where ``brotherhood marchers'' were pelted with rocks in 1987,
prompting a second march by 20,000 civil rights supporters.
   The Ad Hoc Committee Against the Klan has called this week for
counterdemonstrators to gather in opposition to the Klan. Police
plan to keep the groups apart, and the National Guard is on standby.
   Mrs. King told reporters that King Week events will go on
despite recent violence and threats against civil rights activists.
   The commemorative activities come less than a month after four
mail bombs arrived at civil rights and judicial targets in three
states, killing a federal judge in Alabama and a Savannah alderman
who was an attorney for the NAACP.
   King Week in Atlanta will include an ecumenical service at
King's old church, Ebenezer Baptist, and a parade down Peachtree
Street and historic Auburn Avenue, site of the King Center and the
civil rights leader's crypt.
   ``The precautions one should take _ we always try to take
them,'' said Mrs. King, adding that she was reluctant to draw
further attention to those responsible for the bombings.
   ``To talk about this only invites people to do more of this kind
of violence,'' she said.
   Mrs. King noted that threats of violence are nothing new to the
civil rights community. ``There have been threats on my life ...
and, of course, my husband's life was constantly threatened.'' King
was assassinated in 1968.
   For the first time in the five-year history of the King federal
holiday, the Monday legal holiday falls this year on King's actual
birthday, Jan. 15. He would have been 61.

   President Bush hailed the ``heroic
performance'' Friday of American women who fought in the U.S.
invasion of Panama, but said he will reserve judgment on the role
of females in combat pending Pentagon review.
   The involvement of approximately 600 women of the nearly 26,000
American troops who took part in the U.S. invasion has renewed the
debate over women in combat.
   Army regulations prohibit women from serving in combat and U.S.
law bars women from combat in the Navy and Air Force.
   Questioned about the participation of women in the invasion,
Bush said their original assignments were non-combat, but, ``any
time you have a highly trained, gung-ho volunteer force and they're
caught up in some of the firefights that went on, a person can be
... put into a combat situation.''
   During the invasion, Army Capt. Linda L. Bray led male and
female troops from a military police platoon into combat with
approximately 40 members of the Panamanian Defense Forces hiding in
a dog kennel.
   Three members of the Panamanian Defense Forces were killed.
   ``I would let the heroic performance of these people be weighed
and measured, and then see if the Defense Department wanted to
recommend to the president any additional changes,'' Bush told
reporters at a news briefing.
   Earlier in the day, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee said Congress will ``probably take a step
forward'' on the role of women in combat in light of their stepped
up role in Panama.
   But the senator, John Warner of Virginia, said he does not
foresee ``full equality'' for female soldiers.
   ``There are still certain areas where we cannot co-locate men
and women in close confinement,'' Warner, said in a telephone
interview with reporters.
   The former Navy secretary, joined by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, traveled to Panama
this past week to review the military operations in the wake of the
Dec. 20 invasion that unseated Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Warner said he met with a number of the women involved in the
Panamanian invasion and they ``performed with extraordinary
professional skills.''
   ``We will re-examine in Congress based on their experiences and
determine if we have the right policy,'' said Warner, who cautioned
against rushing toward any change.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, said this past week that she is drafting
legislation that would allow women to serve in Army combat as part
of a four-year test program.
   Warner, in his telephone interivew from San Jose, Costa Rica,
said, ``We'll probably take a step forward based on the events in
Panama ... but it will not result in full equality.''
   Warner, who plans to travel to El Salvador and Guatemala and is
awaiting approval of a visa to Nicaragua, said the initial
opposition among the Central American nations to the U.S. military
intervention in Panama has subsided.
   ``The mood is beginning to shift as they realize that the
military part was near perfection,'' Warner said.

   On Orthodox Christmas, which will be celebrated Sunday, TV will
broadcast live the liturgy service from a Belgrade church, and the
radio will feature a Christmas message by Patriarch German of the
Serbian Orthodox Church, the official news agency said.
   Also for the first time in Communist Yugoslavia, religious
festivities are scheduled to take place on the main Republic square

   Yugoslavia is officially an atheist state, but in recent years
people have openly celebrated religious holidays without

   A Japanese piano maker and a life insurance company
said Friday they will help finance a plan to establish a Chopin
memorial center in Poland.
   Sumitomo Life Insurance, Co. spokesman Yasuhisa Tanabe said his
compnay and Yamaha have reached initial agreement with the Polish
Culture Ministry to finance the project.
   The Chopin center, to be built in memory of Polish composer and
pianist Frederic Chopin, will organize seminars and lessons, and
provide an international meeting place for young pianists, Tanabe
said.
   He said details of the financial assistance have not been
finalized.
   Comments from Yamaha were not available due to a company holiday
Friday.
   The nationally circulated Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported
Friday that Poland asked the two companies for assistance due to
the country's financial difficulties. Construction will require an
estimated $18 million, it said.
   The paper said Yamaha will lend $2 million and Sumitomo $4
million by purchasing shares that are to be issued by the center.
   Construction will start sometime this year and is to be
completed in 1992 or 1993, the newspaper reported.

   President Bush said Friday he will dispatch
Vice President Dan Quayle on a fence-mending trip throughout Latin
America in an effort to counter negative reaction to the U.S.
military invasion of Panama.
   ``To some degree I am concerned,'' about that reaction, Bush
told a White House news conference. ``Because I am well aware of
how our friends south of our border, including my friend President
(Carlos) Salinas (of Mexico) look at the use of American force
anywhere. So I am concerned about it.''
   Quayle's agenda and the timing of the trip were still being
decided, said his press secretary, David Beckwith. The only country
that was definitely on his schedule was Honduras, where he already
had planned to attend the Jan. 27 presidential inauguration. At
least seven Latin heads of state are expected to attend and Quayle
could lay the groundwork for the rest of his visits in meetings
with them.
   Bush indicated he recognizes Latin sensitivity to what
historically has been seen as a heavy-handed U.S. policy toward
Central and South America, including military interventions in
years past, toppling of leaders and installation of governments
friendly to the United States.
   ``I view this as very, very important diplomacy,'' the president
said of Quayle's trip.
   None of the Latin countries voiced support for his Dec. 20
invasion of Panama, and many of them strongly condemned it. Peru
went so far as to withdraw in protest from the upcoming drug summit
with Bush in Colombia. It later reversed course and said it would
send a representative.
   The Organization of American States overwhelming passed a
resolution deploring the invasion, with only five absentions from
countries who wanted a condemnation of Noriega as well to be
included in the resolution.
   Bush insisted, however, that the negative feeling that has
resulted from the invasion is ``something that's correctable,
because I think they know that I have tried a lot of consultion,
that we have exhausted the remedies in this particular case of
multilateral diplomacy.
   ``But given the history of the use of U.S. force, I would be
remiss if I didn't face up to the problem that we must go forward
diplomatically now to explain how this president looks at the
protection of American life, that we acted, in our view well within
our rights, but that we will continue consultation.''
   He said Quayle ``will be in a position to explain very clearly
not only U.S. policy, but our aspirations for Panama, and indeed,
for this entire hemisphere.''
   He said the Latin nations must understand the invasion was
motivated by ``the protection of American life.''
   Asked if he was reverting to old U.S. policies that have upset
the Latin countries for years, Bush said that Quayle's trip ``takes
on enormous importance to convince the people of the truth.''
   ``We are not reverting to just a willful ... use of force that
has no rationale,'' he said. ``But when it comes to the protection
of American life, please, our friends south of the border,
understand that this president is going to protect it.''
   Bush noted that the U.S. military intervention that drove
Noriega from power was well-received by many of the Panamanian
people themselves.
   ``It has been overwhelming,'' he said of the Panamanian response.
   Although no timetable has been set for Quayle's trip, it will
force postponement of a Feb. 4-11 European journey the vice
president had been planning. He was to have visited several
countries to consult with U.S. allies.

housing programs, business development and bank loans to help
Panama's shattered economy recover from the U.S. invasion and years
of economic sanctions.
   Bush was not more specific on what the United States might do to
help Panama recover from invasion-related damage, estimated at
perhaps $2 billion, and from two years of economic decline that
flowed partly from the U.S. sanctions against Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   Nor did Bush address where his administration will find money to
help Panama in a foreign aid budget already strained past its
limits. Foreign assistance is among the least popular programs on
Capitol Hill, where the president would have to secure approval for
aid to Panama.
   It was learned separately that Bush administration officials are
looking into possible aid that includes:
   _Building houses for people left homeless by the bombing and
combat.
   _Helping Panama to pay its $543 million in foreign debt so it
can get new loans.
   _Getting other nations involved in the recovery effort.
   _Loans to help businesses recover.
   While recommendations have yet to be drawn up and presented to
Bush, one administration source said ``there's a sense of urgency
and we want to move quickly and respond quickly.''
   One official, who, like the others, requested anonymity, said it
also is likely the administration will move up from March the date
on which officials must certify whether Panama is cooperating in
antidrug efforts.
   By speeding up the evaluation, the administration could enable
Panama to receive U.S. trade benefits and Caribbean Basin
Initiative benefits and have its sugar quota reinstated, that
official said.
   The embryonic, U.S.-installed government of President Guillermo
Endara has expressed strong antidrug sentiments and would be
expected to win certification, said the official. Such
certification was denied to Panama under Noriega, now in U.S.
custody on a variety of drug charges.
   ``The revitalization of the Panamanian economy is a major
priority in the months ahead,'' Bush told a White House news
conference, ``as are our efforts for humanitarian assistance.
   ``I can report today that considerable progress has been made so
far in returning Panama to a normal state of affairs. The new
government has taken charge, and President Endara is working
tirelessly to meet the needs of his people.''
   Bush said the team led by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger that visited Panama this week had praised the Endara
government.
   ``They are discussing housing programs, business development,
bank loans that will help spur economic growth. We are committed to
be a part of that process,'' Bush said.
   The president noted that he already has released nearly $400
million in assets in U.S. banks that was frozen under the sanctions
against the Noriega regime.
   U.S. officials involved in the discussions with Panama said
Endara did not present a laundry list of economic requests, but
rather talked about general needs.
   ``The Endara government has to sort out its priorities,'' said
one official, who also requested anonymity.
   Just how much money the administration might find to help Panama
is an unanswered question. Bush's press secretary, Marlin
Fitzwater, acknowledged this week that the current 1991 budget, to
be sent to Congress on Jan. 29, includes no money to help Panama.
   The Endara government indicated to the Eagleburger team that it
recognizes that private businesses in Panama will play a major role
in restoring the economy and does not expect the U.S. governement
to do everything, said one source.
   It is expected the administration will turn to friends around
the world to help Panama. In particular, officials have mentioned
Japan.
   Japanese ambassador Ryohei Murata discussed the matter Friday
with Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Afterward, Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith, said he
could not disclose the substance of the discussion other than to
say, ``The vice president complimented Japan for considering
extending aid.''
   Japan retained its ties with the Noriega government despite U.S.
urgings that the Tokyo government help isolate the dictator. Japan
has had substantial economic interests in Panama.

   The nation's thrift institutions lost $6.4
billion in deposits in October, rather than the $5.6 billion in
outflows originally reported, the Office of Thrift Supervision said
Friday.
   The revision of Wednesday's reported losses was based on
additional data not previously included in its monthly thrift
activity report because it had not been validated, the OTS said.
   ``The data announced by OTS on Jan. 3 was based on reporting by
96 percent of the industry, with statistical estimates made for the
remaining 4 percent,'' it said.
   Despite the revision, the October loss, while representing the
16th outflow in 17 months, still was an improvement over
September's $8.7 billion in net withdrawals.
   The thrift office also revised previous data for October that
showed that assets at thrifts showed little change after a string
of sharp declines. In fact, October represented another sharp
decline, $6.4 billion, the same as the deposit outflow.

   The man who summoned police with his car phone and
said a black robber had abducted and shot him and his pregnant wife
was only a routine suspect in the case until his own brother gave
police evidence of an elaborate, grisly hoax, officials said Friday.
   Charles Stuart killed himself Thursday after learning his
brother had revealed evidence against him in the Oct. 23 killing of
his wife, Carol.
   Stuart had been seriously wounded himself. While hospitalized he
wrote a moving letter to be read at his wife's funeral. Then he
made a dramatic appearance at the deathbed of his newborn son, who
was delivered by Caesarean section after the shootings and died 17
days later. And he gave a description of a black man as the killer.
   ``He thought he had the perfect crime ... the eulogy at the
church that he had a friend read ... This guy went way out. He
really thought he had a perfect crime,'' said Reading Police Chief
Edward Marchand.
   Paul Leary, first assistant Suffolk County district attorney,
said although there were some apparent discrepancies in Stuart's
account, investigators felt they were not significant enough to
pursue. He would not elaborate, citing a grand jury investigation.
   But Leary said Stuart was a routine suspect from the beginning
because investigators always check out husbands when wives are
killed.
   ``No one was ruled out,'' Leary said. ``I am told
(investigators) checked out that which was at the crime scene and
also went back into the personal lives of these individuals and
found that they were something just short of a storybook-type
couple, according to relatives on both sides of the family.''
   John Dawley, who had served as Stuart's lawyer, said that until
this week's developments in the case, he ``had no reason to believe
this was anything but a random act of violence.''
   ``The guy was a remarkable guy and I don't say that lightly. I
say that in light of everything I know. I would never have expected
it in a million years.''
   Jack Levin, a professor at Northeastern University and expert on
crime, said if Stuart was his wife's killer, the crime was so
premeditated and elaborate it could only be the work of a sociopath
_ ``the last people you expect. We're talking about the cream of
the crop in killing.''
   The scales tipped when Stuart's brother, Matthew, 23, went to
police Wednesday.
   The younger Stuart told police his brother asked him to meet him
the evening of Oct. 23 in the city's Mission Hill area, which is
where the shooting took place, said Matthew's attorney, John
Perenyi.
   The Stuarts had been at a hospital for birthing classes. Stuart
told police a gunman forced them to drive to the Mission Hill area
and robbed and shot them. When police found them, Mrs. Stuart was
near death in the passenger's seat.
   Perenyi said Stuart drove up to the meeting place that evening,
tossed a sack to Matthew, who was sitting in his car, and told his
younger brother to take it home to Revere, where Matthew lives with
their parents.
   Stuart suggested to his brother that the bag might have to be
disposed of, according to the attorney. Inside the sack, Matthew
found a pistol, Mrs. Stuart's supposedly stolen pocketbook and
engagement ring, Perenyi said. Matthew took out the ring and
disposed of the rest of the items in the Pines River in Revere, his
lawyer said.
   After police heard the account from Matthew, police divers found
the pocketbook Thursday but not the gun. Matthew gave the
engagement ring to investigators Wednesday night.
   It was dark the night of the shooting, but Perenyi said Matthew
told him he saw something in his brother's car that, on reflection,
might have been Mrs. Stuart. Perenyi said the shootings apparently
had taken place by that time.
   Stuart committed suicide Thursday by jumping off a bridge.
   Perenyi said the district attorney's office told him Matthew was
not a suspect in the case. Investigators refused to comment whether
there were any other suspects besides Charles Stuart.
   Perenyi said Matthew could not offer a motive.
   A black man with a long criminal record, William Bennett, was
named in published reports as a suspect. Although Thursday's
developments cleared him of suspicion in the Stuart shootings, he
remained in jail Friday on unrelated charges.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Orders New Trial in Cigarette-Safety Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday threw out a
$400,000 verdict against a cigarette maker in the death of a smoker
but gave her family a chance for a new trial on another aspect of
their case against three tobacco companies.
   The damage judgment had been the first in the nation in a
smoker-death case. Rose Cipollone of Little Ferry, N.J., died of
lung cancer at age 58 in 1984, after smoking for 42 years.
   In its complex ruling, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed a U.S. District Court ruling that dismissed claims of Mrs.
Cipollone's family that the cigarette companies failed to warn of
the risks of tobacco smoking after 1965, when a federal labeling
requirement took effect.
   In addition, the court reversed a jury's award of $400,000
against Liggett Group Inc. to Mrs. Cipollone's husband, Antonio
Cipollone of Lakehurst, N.J., on grounds the company had violated
an express warranty, or advertising promise that its products were
safe.
   But the family did win the right to a new trial against the
three on one aspect of the case.
   The court, in an opinion written by Judge Edward R. Becker, said
Cipollone has ``live claims'' against Liggett and the other two
companies, Lorillard Inc. and Philip Morris Inc., on grounds they
marketed the product knowing the risks of cigarette smoking.
   That ``risk-utility'' theory of liability involves whether the
average user can easily recognize the risks of using it. The
District Court had barred Cipollone's claim of ``risk-utility''
against all three.
   In addition, the circuit court ruled Cipollone could make
additional claims against Liggett that had been denied in lower
court.
   Cipollone had won in District Court on his contention that the
tobacco companies promised through advertising that their products
were safe, which resulted in the $400,000 award.
   The appeals court said the District Court erred on that point,
by preventing Liggett from trying to prove that Mrs. Cipollone
didn't believe the companies' advertisements in the first place.
   However, the court said Cipollone could pursue other points that
had been denied in District Court.
   ``Plaintiff's attorneys are back to square one after having
spent nearly six years and nearly $3 million in lawyer and legal
fees,'' said Josiah Murray, Liggett's general counsel.
   Murray said he was ``extremely gratified'' by the portion of the
decision that reversed the $400,000 award.

   A priest asked to give up his parish post
for enforcing a dress code banning shorts and miniskirts said
Friday the archbishop who made the request will face an ``angry
Christ.''
   The Rev. Roger Griese of Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church
``has been asked to leave,'' said Rita Reilly, spokeswoman for the
Archdiocese of Cincinnati, which includes Griese's 80-member church
in downtown Dayton. She refused to say what his response was.
   A published report said the head of the diocese, Archbishop
Daniel Pilarczyk, had ordered Griese to give up his post, effective
last Wednesday. The Rev. Daniel Conlon, chancellor of the
archdiocese, declined to comment.
   Griese, pastor of Sacred Heart for 21 years, came under fire for
denying communion to worshipers wearing clothes he considers
inappropriate for church.
   In a statement the 73-year-old Griese released through a
spokeswoman, he accused the media of character assassination.
   ``I do not hate Archbishop Pilarczyk,'' Griese said. ``I have
only pity for him since he will have to face an angry Christ in
judgment.''
   A woman answering the door at Sacred Heart Rectory on Friday
said Griese would not see anyone. Messages left for Griese were not
returned.
   The Cincinnati Enquirer reported that Pilarczyk's order came
after a three-month correspondence in which the archbishop wrote
that Griese's conduct ``often led to embarrassment for the church''
and asked the priest to resign.
   The newspaper reported that Pilarczyk ordered Griese to accept
retirement, saying the decision was based on the priest's ``public
challenge of my rightful authority as diocesan bishop'' and
Griese's refusal to follow instructions on maintaining a dress code.
   Griese criticized the archbishop from the pulpit during Mass in
September after after Pilarczyk instructed him to ease enforcement
of a church dress code banning shorts, miniskirts, sun dresses and
jeans. Griese had twice denied communion to worshiper James Garvey
when he came to church dressed in shorts.
   ``It is people like him across this world that drive Catholics
away from the Catholic Church,'' Garvey said at the time. ``My
faith was taken away from me by not giving me communion for two
Sundays in a row for wearing shorts. ... That tells me he's judging
me based on what I wear.''
   Griese will remain a priest in good standing, Pilarczyk said in
a letter quoted by the Enquirer. The church's mandatory retirement
age is 75.
   ``Three months ago I concluded that you could no longer fulfill
effectively your office of pastor,'' Pilarczyk said in the letter.
``Since then ... I have several times encouraged you to resign from
office or to offer concrete evidence that I should not proceed with
removal. You have responded in the negative to both requests.''
   However, in statement from Griese released through a
spokeswoman, the priest accused the media of ``character
assassination.''
   A spokesman for Griese said he plans an appeal to the Vatican,
which is a priest's right under the church's Canon Law.
   The archbishop's letter is to be read Sunday to Sacred Heart
parishioners, announcing Griese's removal and the appointment of
the Rev. Francis Pilliod of Dayton as the new pastor, the Enquirer
reported. Reached Friday, Pilliod declined to comment.

<HEAD>Bush Says Seeking No Deal on Noriega Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Friday he is ``not seeking
a deal'' on a reduced charge for Manuel Antonio Noriega and vowed
to ``bend over backwards'' to avoid saying anything that would
interfere with the deposed Panamanian ruler's trial.
   ``Our case is strong, our resolve is firm and our legal
representations are sound,'' Bush told a nationally televised news
conference after discussing Noriega's prosecution on
drug-trafficking charges with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   Bush also announced he is dispatching Vice President Dan Quayle
on a fence-mending tour of Latin America ``within the next several
days'' to explain the U.S. military action and muster support for
the new Panamanian government of Guillermo Endara.
   Conceding the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion of Panama had upset U.S.
allies in Central and South America, the president said: ``I am
concerned, because I am well aware of how our friends south of our
border ... look at the use of American force anywhere.''
   But, he added, ``I think it's something that's correctable.''
   Bush said he had ``no immediate plans'' to visit Panama.
However, an administration official, who declined to be identified,
said a presidential visit is under consideration and that Panama
might also be included on Quayle's itinerary.
   The president called revitalizing Panama's economy ``a major
priority'' to help it recover from the U.S. military invasion and
economic sanctions. He did not put a price tag on the U.S. aid, but
some estimates for the damage have run as high as $2 billion.
   Even as he savored Noriega's capture, Bush said he would be
``ever mindful'' of the legal process from now on, suggesting he
would refrain from his previous characterizations of Noriega as a
``thug'' and criminal.
   ``He is now in custody. Time for rhetoric is over,'' he said.
   Bush said he was convinced Noriega would get a fair trial and
``I am going to bend over backwards and not answer hypothetical
questions or not do anything that might prejudice that.''
   With Noriega securely in U.S. custody in Florida, Bush said he
hoped to bring U.S. combat troops home from Panama ``as soon as
possible.'' But he declined to give a timetable.
   Still, he ruled out a long-term peacekeeping role for U.S.
troops. ``I'd like to see their police forces, whatever emerges,
reconstituted,'' Bush said. Noriega's Panamanian Defense Forces
were decimated in the U.S. military action.
   Bush said the some 12,000 troops stationed at U.S. bases in
Panama before the invasion would be left there, but would not serve
a police role.
   Some 2,900 combat troops were brought home this week, leaving
about 24,500 military personnel, according to the Pentagon.
   In an opening statement at his news conference, Bush said, ``Our
government is not seeking a deal with Noriega. Our policy remains
that we have brought him to this country for prosecution.''
   ``We are committed to a fair trial and to providing all the
protections guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and laws,'' Bush
added.
   Asked if he would rule out a plea bargain with Noriega _ perhaps
offering reduced charges to Noriega in exchange for his information
on drug-trafficking _ Bush said, ``I'm not ruling it in.''
   He added: ``I'm just saying he's got his rights and he ought _
we ought not to stand up here and try to define narrowly what they
are.''
   In Miami, Noriega attorney Steven Kollin said Noriega wasn't
interested in a plea bargain. ``A man who is innocent is not
receptive to any plea bargain. General Noriega is not guilty of any
of these charges.''
   Noriega refused to answer the charges against him at a brief
hearing Wednesday, and the federal judge in his case entered an
innocent plea on his behalf. The general remained in custody at an
undisclosed location Thursday.
   Bush dismissed as ``ridiculous'' a question on whether the
invasion of Panama and surrender of Noriega had become a
``political jackpot'' for him. ``A president's called on to take
certain actions. We're not going in to try to furbish a political
image,'' he said.
   Even so, Bush was asked if the action would silence Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell's criticism that Bush had a timid
foreign policy. ``Knowing George, he'll find a way. And that's his
job. Look, we're going into an election year.''
   An aide to the Maine Democrat, Diane Dewhirst, said: ``Sen.
Mitchell has consistently said that when he agrees with Bush on
foreign policy he will be vigorously supportive and that when he
disagrees he will offer constructive alternatives. That has not
changed.''
   Bush took the unusual step of ending his news conference with a
complaint to television networks about coverage of his last news
conference, on Dec. 21. He protested that some networks juxtaposed
his lighthearted banter with reporters with pictures of bodies of
U.S. servicemen killed in Panama being unloaded from a transport
plane.
   ``I could understand why the viewers were concerned about
this,'' Bush said. ``They thought that their president at a solemn
moment like that didn't give a damn.''
   His voice choking, Bush said: ``And I do, I do, I feel it so
strongly.''
   In other comments, the president:
   _ Said he did not envision a change in U.S. policy against
intentionally sending military women into combat, although he would
weigh such a recommendation if presented to him by the Pentagon. He
praised the ``heroic performance'' of a ``highly trained, gung-ho''
group of women who did engage in combat in the Panama action.
   _ Deplored the death of an American nun in Nicaragua, but
refused to fix blame on the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. He noted
that the Contras had denied a role, but he added: ``It is
extraordinarily murky.''
   _ Defended anew two secret missions to China by National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, saying ``there has been
progress'' toward reform as a result of the visits.

<TEXT>
   East Germany on Friday lifted a ban on
singing in public of the original version of its national hymn,
``Germany United Fatherland,'' declaring the anthem written in 1949
to be part of its cultural heritage.
   Government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said the hymn would once
again be sung on official radio and television broadcasts.
   The hymn was banned by the communist government 20 years ago
because it implied support for reunification of Germany _ a theme
long resisted by the East German government.
   Meyer dismissed concerns that restoration of the hymn could be
seen as encouragement of rightist elements or support for a formal
union with West Germany.
   He said officials decided the song should again be sung because
it was a part of East Germany's cultural identity.
   Singing the song again means ``dealing with our own history and
acknowledgement of the time of those historical conditions and
thoughts that inspired'' the hymn, Meyer said.
   ``Germany United Fatherland'' was written by East Germany's
first culture minister, Johannes R. Becher.
   East Germany dropped the national hymn from public gatherings in
1969 because of its inferences to reunifying East and West Germany.
   ``Resurrected and facing the future out of ruins, let us serve
you well, Germany united fatherland,'' the hymn runs in part. ``Old
wants compel us, and united we compel it, because we must succeed,
so that the sun shines more beautiful than ever before over
Germany.''

   The United States is prepared to provide up to
$3 million to an international commission to begin planning the
voluntary relocation of Nicaraguan Contras to their homeland if
democratic conditions exist, it was announced Friday.
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the funds
would be given to a commission comprised of United Nations and
Organization of American States officials. The commission, known by
its Spanish initials, CIAV, was set up partly to oversee the
dismantling of the Contras, most of whom are based in Honduras.
   ``We have explained our intentions to the government of Honduras
and the Nicaraguan resistance,'' Boucher said. ``Both have reacted
favorably. The UN and OAS secretaries general have also been
informed.''
   The commission, Boucher said, will be asked to submit proposals
for use of the funds.
   The disclosure was part of what appears to be an increase in
diplomatic activity concerning the fate of the rebels as Nicaraguan
elections draw closer. The Feb. 25 election in Nicaragua will match
President Daniel Ortega against an opposition coalition led by
presidential candidate Violeta Chamorro.
   Sources close to the Sandinista government said Nicaraguan
officials would meet Saturday with Contra representatives in
Tegucigalpa. CIAV officials also will attend.
   Amnesty for rebels willing to return in peace to Nicaragua will
be discussed, sources said.
   In addition, State Department officials are expected to confer
with CIAV officials at an undetermined location next week on the
peace process.
   Most of the Contras are at camps in southern Honduras. The five
Central American presidents have called for the demobilization of
the Contras but the rebels, with U.S. support, have said they
should remain intact until after next month's elections.
   Boucher's announcement of a conditional U.S. commitment to fund
the demobilization of the Contras was in response to a communique
approved by the five Central American presidents last month.
   According to some interpretations, the communique required the
immediate transfer of all U.S. aid funds for the Contras to the
CIAV. However, the State Department disputes that interpretation
and says it has gone beyond the requirements of the communique.
   U.S. aid to the rebels consists of food, clothing, shelter and
medical services and is due to run out at the end of February.
   The Sandinistas have given high priority to promoting the
dismantling of the Contras, but the rebels have insisted that must
be voluntary and in the context of a free and fair electoral
process in Nicaragua.
   The biggest setback occurred in early November when the
Sandinistas, contending that the rebels engaged in terrorist
activities, suspended a cease-fire that had been in effect
informally with the Contras for the preceding 19 months.
   Nine days of talks between the Sandinistas and the Contras aimed
at restoring the cease-fire ended in failure Nov. 21.

   President Bush said Friday that former
Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson registered his
disagreement with the U.S. military invasion of Panama in a
telephone call to the president's wife, Barbara.
   Asked at a news conference if the Dec. 20 invasion was a
``political jackpot,'' Bush said, ``Well, Jesse Jackson doesn't
think so. He talked to my wife. And so there's differences of
opinion on that.''
   He did not elaborate on Jackson's call. Presidential press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Jackson called Mrs. Bush on
Thursday ``to inquire about her health. He also raised the issue of
Panama. I guess he said the same things he's been saying in the
press,'' the spokesman added.
   Mrs. Bush's press secretary, Anna Perez, confirmed that Jackson
called to talk about Mrs. Bush's health, the subject of recent news
accounts because she is undergoing radiation treatment for a
persistent eye ailment.
   But Perez declined to give further details of the call. ``It was
a private conversation,'' she said.
   Asked if Jackson and Mrs. Bush conversed often, she said, ``I
don't think they're phone pals.''
   Jackson has said the invasion caused a loss of the U.S. ``moral
authority.
   He said in comments published in the Los Angeles Times that the
action dealt a setback to the war on drugs, jeopardized the
upcoming drug summit in Colombia, ``undermined the global movement
toward peaceful democratic change and respect for the rule of law
and ``revived a long history of imperial interference in Central
America.''
   ``One wonders if we have damaged our national soul to feed our
national ego,'' he wrote. ``In a world rapidly turning away from
military solutions, the American action looks morally untenable and
obsolete.''

   One of the thorniest issues facing Manuel Noriega's
prosecutors is ``graymail'' _ the threat that his trial might
expose embarrassing details about the ousted Panamanian leader's
longtime connections with U.S. intelligence agencies.
   The former chief assistant U.S. attorney who forged the February
1988 drug-trafficking indictment against Noriega said Friday that
during his investigation he was thwarted in his efforts to see CIA
material bearing on the case.
   ``I went to look at what they had, but it was worthless _ it
couldn't be all there was,'' said Richard Gregorie, now in private
practice here.
   Viewing any tapes, photos or documents bearing on the case is
essential for prosecutors, he said.
   ``It could be exculpatory if Noriega had ever told anybody about
narcotics activity, which he could use to say he was acting as an
agent'' in his dealings with Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel,
said Gregorie.
   Noriega defense attorney Steven Kollin has said he will seek
Noriega's CIA files.
   ``We're looking for the truth and the only way to get to the
truth is to get to those documents,'' Kollin said Friday.
   There is ample evidence that Noriega had some relationship with
the CIA and other U.S. agencies, but the exact extent is disputed
or still secret.
   In August 1988, the White House halted a General Accounting
Office probe into those connections, refusing to turn over material
requested because it was beyond the congressional agency's
authority and dealt with ``sensitive intelligence material,''
according to presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The CIA used Noriega as an ``asset'' from the 1970s on,
according to congressional testimony, with some witnesses saying he
eventually was paid as much as $200,000 a year for information when
he became head of his nation's intelligence service and then
commander of the armed forces in 1983.
   That period included George Bush's term as CIA director in the
mid-1970s under President Ford. Bush has since said that although
there were reports of Noriega's drug dealing at that time, he had
no proof then.
   One of the principal witnesses cited in the indictment was Jose
Blandon, a former top member of Panama's intelligence apparatus who
fell out with Noriega and fled to the United States.
   His grand jury testimony is secret, but Blandon told a Senate
subcommittee just after the indictment that Noriega had met twice
with then-National Security Council representative Lt. Col. Oliver
North in 1985 to find ways around the congressional ban on aid to
the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   Blandon also told senators that Bush, then vice president,
called Noriega before the 1983 invasion of Grenada to ask him to
intercede with Cuban President Fidel Castro. Blandon said Bush
wanted Castro to tell his troops on the Caribbean island not to
fire on U.S. forces.
   Bush at the time of the hearing called Blandon's account a
``total fabrication.''
   Blandon also said the CIA sent Noriega files on the private
lives of U.S. senators with an interest in Panama.
   The CIA issued a statement saying it ``categorically denied''
Blandon's assertion, but Blandon stuck by his testimony.
   Noriega often traveled to Washington to meet with then-CIA
director William Casey to discuss the Contras and other issues,
according to testimony.
   Noriega's cozy relationship with the United States began to sour
in 1985 when he was linked to the brutal slaying of his foe, Hugo
Spadafora, and the firing of the nation's president.
   Adm. John Poindexter, then national security adviser to Reagan,
went to Panama in December 1985 to demand Noriega's resignation,
according to The Miami Herald. Noriega immediately flew to
Washington to meet with Casey, who told the administration that
Noriega was too valuable an intelligence source to lose.
   Last week, the Justice Department acknowledged that, in its
haste to indict Noriega, guidelines in the handling of CIA material
``may not have been completely followed,'' according to spokesman
David Runkel.
   But both Bush and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh continue to
insist that there are no smoking guns that would embarrass the
president or the CIA, or cause the case to unravel in court.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Urges Experienced Prosecutors Fill Strike Force
Vacancies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has urged
U.S. attorneys around the country to choose experienced prosecutors
to fill vacancies on the organized crime strike forces being
transferred to their offices, a spokesman said Friday.
   The strike forces, which operated for 22 years as field offices
of the Justice Department, have lost 33 attorneys, nearly a quarter
of their force, since Thornburgh announced plans in February to put
them under the control of U.S. attorneys.
   Some who have left said more, experienced mob prosecutors are
likely to depart now that a year of controversy and objections from
Congress have failed to block the merger.
   Departing strike force attorneys and former Justice officials
said the merger was unattractive to many mob prosecutors because
the U.S. attorneys, appointed by the president, tend to concentrate
on shorter-term cases with quick impact and publicity rather than
the complex, long-term investigations used during the last two
decades to imprison the mob leadership in more than 11 eleven major
cities.
   Thornburgh imposed the change, which he has sought since he was
U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh 15 years ago, on New Year's Day.
   Justice spokesman Dave Runkel said Thornburgh spoke at an
all-day meeting in a suburban motel with the strike force chiefs,
affected U.S. attorneys and members of the Criminal Division's
Organized Crime and Racketeering Section.
   The meeting Thursday was closed to the public.
   ``The attorney general stressed the need for the U.S. attorneys
to put experienced prosecutors in vacant spots on the strike forces
_ prosecutors who previously worked on sensitive and complex
cases,'' Runkel said. ``And the U.S. attorneys reported that that
is exactly what they are doing where there are vacancies.''
   Some 115 strike force positions are being turned into assistant
U.S. attorney posts committed to working on organized crime;
another 20 attorneys are being recruited to join a squad in
Washington available to handle emergency assignments around the
country.
   Runkel said that of the 135 slots, 116 are filled and five more
attorneys are in the process of being hired.
   Runkel said Thursday's meeting went well.
   ``Everybody's committed to making this system work,'' he said.
``There may be some who felt there wasn't a need for this change
now, but all recognize that the change has occurred.''
   He said Thornburgh and other top officials who addressed the
planning session stressed that they want organized crime
investigations ``carried out as vigorously in the future as in the
past.''
   Thornburgh has said the move was needed to end turf battles
between strike force chiefs and U.S. attorneys and to address to
forms of organized crime such as Colombian drug lords and street
gangs.
   ``The only hot point came when I spoke and gave them advice on
how to handle the press,'' Runkel said, declining to elaborate.
   The strike forces operated in 14 headquarters cities and 11
sub-office cities. They are being merged with 23 U.S. attorney
offices that cover the same areas.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Bacteria Treatment for Cross-Eye, Other Eye Disorder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Friday approved a type of
food poisoning bacteria for use as a treatment for cross-eye and
another eye disorder that renders its victims legally blind.
   The Food and Drug Administration said a sterile, purified
botulism toxin was approved as an injection therapy to treat
strabismus, or cross-eye, and blepharospasm, a muscle disorder that
makes the eyes close involuntarily.
   ``This is seen as the first successful treatment for both
conditions,'' said Eva Kemper, an FDA spokeswoman.
   When eaten in improperly handled food, the toxin can cause
botulism or food poisoning, an ailment that can lead to paralysis
or death.
   ``However, in clinical studies, the injected form was used
safely in thousands of men and women to weaken muscles that pulled
an eye in or out or to reduce spasms in muscles that pull the
eyelid closed,'' the agency said in a written statement.
   ``With the blepharospasm, patients are legally blind because
they can't hold their eyelids open,'' said Kemper.
   Strabismus can be the commonly known cross-eye, in which the
eyes look inward at each other, or wall-eye, in which they look out.
   Doctors would inject the drug, botulinum toxin type A, into
muscles near the eye, not the eye itself, to aid in ``turning off''
the muscle, the FDA said.
   The injection would take effect in a day or two and would last
for about three months, according to the agency.
   FDA approval requires product labeling that indicates it is not
recommended for use for children under 12 and an advisory to
physicians that sedentary patients treated with the drug resume
activity slowly.
   ``At least two patients who had been incapacitated and sedentary
because of their previous condition apparently over-exerted too
quickly and died of cardiac collapse,'' the agency said.
   ``The most common side effects are that some patients' eyelids
may droop or their eyes may feel irritated,'' it said.
   The product, which will be sold as Oculinum, will be available
in approximately 30 days once the FDA-mandated label changes have
been completed, according to Carolyn Henderson, spokeswoman for the
California-based distributor, Allergan Pharmaceuticals division of
Allergan, Inc.
   There are about 100,000 new cases of strabismus diagnosed each
year but most of those cases can be treated with more traditional
therapies like eyeglasses, surgery on the muscles or exercises, the
FDA said.
   However, the agency said about 15,000 severe cases don't respond
to those therapies and they would likely be aided by the new drug.
   Blepharospasm affects between 3,000 and 5,000 Americans who are
rendered legally blind by the condition.

<HEAD>Arguments Heard in Vermont's Appeal of Judge Retirement Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States' rights and the intent of Congress in
outlawing age discrimination were the focus of oral arguments
Friday in Vermont's appeal of a ruling that bars the state from
forcing a 71-year-old judge to retire.
   Vermont Supreme Court Justice Louis Peck is challenging a
provision in his state's Constitution that requires judges to
retire at age 70.
   William Gray, the attorney for the state, urged three judges of
the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn a lower court
ruling that struck down the mandatory retirement rule.
   Gray said the ruling upset the balance of power between state
and federal governments by taking away Vermont's right to make
decisions about its judiciary.
   The states of Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Mexico have
filed briefs backing Vermont. Massachusetts and Connecticut have
mandatory retirement provisions for judges. New Mexico does not,
but filed the brief through the Lincoln Legal Foundation on the
issue of states' rights.
   Peck, who continues to sit on Vermont's highest court, filed an
age discrimination complaint with the federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission in May, five months after he turned 70. His
retirement had been scheduled to go into effect June 30.
   The EEOC picked up Peck's case and filed a complaint in federal
court in Vermont, where U.S. District Judge Lee Gagliardi ruled
that Peck and other appointed state judges in Vermont could not be
forced to retire because of their age.
   Gagliardi said state judges were protected by the federal Age
Discrimination and Employment Act, which prohibits age
discrimination against most employees.
   Gray argued that that act could not be applied in this case
because it did not specifically name state judges. He said there
had to be a clear Congressional intent to pre-empt a state
constitution.
   That argument found favor with the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Boston in an earlier ruling on Massachusetts' mandatory
retirement provision. The 1st Circuit ruled it could not find ``a
sufficiently clear statement by Congress that it intended to
overrule the clear intent of the people of a state in an area
intimately and fundamentally related to that state's
self-governance.''
   The 1st Circuit ruling has meant judges in Massachusetts must
retire at age 70.
   EEOC attorney Paul Bogas cited a similar case in Wyoming in
which the Supreme Court found that the state's interests were not
seriously threatened by the federal age discrimination law.
   Bogas spent most of his arguments countering another position
forwarded by Gray _ that state judges were covered by an exemption
to the Age Discrimination and Employment Act for elected officials
and policy-making appointees who work for elected officials.
   ``The constitutional and legal duties of state judges are
completely independent from the governor who appoints them,'' Bogas
said. He said judges clearly were not policy makers.
   The appeals court will issue a written ruling at a later date.
   Peck was not in court for the arguments but two other judges who
are fighting similar battles were present. They were Robert Satter,
a senior Superior Court Judge from Connecticut, and Justice Isaac
Rubin of the Appellate Division of New York's Supreme Court.

<TEXT>
   A county prosecutor resigned and checked
into a psychiatric hospital Friday after state police determined he
had fabricated a story that two men tried to assassinate him on New
Year's Day.
   Camden County Prosecutor Samuel Asbell, who routinely
accompanied police on drug busts, may face criminal charges pending
the outcome of the investigation and a psychiatric evaluation,
Attorney General Peter N. Perretti said.
   Asbell said Tuesday that gunmen opened fire on him during a
high-speed car chase through the streets of Camden, and that he was
sprayed with glass from his car windows but not seriously injured.
He also said he shot one of his assailants in the head. Asbell said
he believed the attack was related to his tough stance on illegal
drugs.
   ``Thank God I'm alive,'' the 46-year-old Asbell had said. ``I
guess it just wasn't my day or my time.''
   But Perretti said at a news conference Friday that ``the event
was staged by Prosecutor Asbell, apparently acting alone.''
   Perretti said Asbell was questioned for several hours Thursday
night into Friday morning at the state police barracks in Bellmawr,
where he was confronted with details of the state police
investigation. Police found he had shot out his own car windows.
   Perretti would not comment on why Asbell might have staged the
shooting.
   Asbell's five-year term as prosecutor had expired, and he was
serving as a holdover. It was unclear if he was going to be
reappointed by Gov. Thomas Kean or Gov.-elect James Florio, who
takes office Jan. 16.
   Gloucester County Prosecutor Richard Hickey III, said he
considered Asbell a close friend and that ``he loved what he was
doing. I really feel for his family right now.''
   Asbell had said his Lincoln Town Car was ambushed by two men in
a green Toyota station wagon about 5 p.m. Monday after he left his
office, where he had gone to catch up on paperwork and get his
paycheck following a vacation.
   When the gunmen opened fire, Asbell said, he fired one round
from a 12-gauge sawed-off shotgun that he kept in his car and
unloaded seven rounds from a semi-automatic handgun.
   ``I had my shotgun on my lap and I just let go,'' Asbell said
Tuesday. ``I saw his head explode.''
   Word of the alleged attack sparked increased security at other
county prosecutors' offices across the state.
   Asbell entered the Carrier Foundation in Somerset County for
psychiatric evualation, Perretti said, adding that if Asbell
decided to check out, authorities could move to have him held
involuntarily. The hospital said it would neither conform nor deny
Asbell's presence, citing privacy laws.
   Perretti, who appointed Assistant Attorney General James F.
Mulvihil as acting prosecutor, said there is no evidence that
Asbell's psychiatric problems affected his work as prosecutor.
   ``We are very satisfied this is a sudden and aberrational turn
of behavior by Prosecutor Asbell,'' Perretti said.
   Kean said he was shocked by the events of the past week, and
added that if Asbell is found mentally incompetent, ``prosecution
would not serve any purpose.''
   Asbell maintained his story as late as Thursday.
   ``I have met with the attorney general, and he made it
explicitly clear to me that I am a victim ... of a violent crime.
He very kindly said I have to get (in) my mind the fact that I am
not a prosecutor in this matter, but I am a victim,'' Asbell said
at a news conference.
   Asbell and his family were placed under 24-hour state police
protection after he told authorities of the attack.
   But authorities said they were somewhat confounded by the lack
of leads in the case. No body was found, and a victim did not
turned up at hospitals.
   Asbell, while in private practice, was shot in the chest in 1970
while representing a client whose property was put up for sheriff's
sale. The bullet remains lodged in his chest.

   Heavy snow fell early Friday over parts of Utah, and rain fell
over much of the South.
   During the early morning, 4 to 11 inches of snow fell in the
mountains of northern Utah, and there were 3- to 4-inch
accumulations in the lower elevations of Utah County.
   Snow also fell along the southern shore of Lake Superior at
midday, and snowshowers were scattered over northeastern and
northwestern New York state and southern North Dakota.
   Rain fell from west-central South Carolina across central and
northwestern Georgia, southeastern Tennessee, northern Alabama,
northern and central Mississippi, much of Louisiana, southeastern
Texas, and the Florida Peninsula.
   A cold front approached the northern Pacific Coast and gale
warnings were posted along the Washington and Oregon coasts, with a
high wind warning for Saturday over the Front Range of the Montana
Rockies.
   Rain fell over western Washington state.
   There were no reports of measurable snowfall during the six
hours up to noon and rainfall amounts during the same period were
less than an inch, the National Weather Service said.
   Miami warmed to a record high Friday of 83 degrees.
   Friday's low for the Lower 48 states was 7 degrees below zero at

<TEXT>
   A 3,500-pound engine that sheared off a
Northwest Airlines jet in flight was found Friday at a wooded
cattle ranch, officials said.
   The engine was spotted by a Madison County sheriff's helicopter
and the area was secured by deputies as a federal air safety
inspector made his way to the site.
   ``They have been instructed not to do anything with the engine
until he gets there,'' said Ted Lopatkiewicz, spokesman for the
National Transportation Safety Board in Washington, D.C.
   The inspection would probably begin Saturday, Lopatkiewicz said.
   The engine was found on the ranch of a man who reported hearing
a loud noise Thursday, said sheriff's dispatcher Fred Register.
Deputies were unable to check the tip until late Friday morning
because of heavy fog.
   The engine fell Thursday from the right tailwing of a
14-year-old Boeing 727 on a flight from Miami to Minneapolis with
139 passengers and a crew of six on board. The plane diverted to
Tampa and landed safely.
   Radar showed the engine separating from the plane and
investigators believed its six-mile plunge landed it near Madison.
Officials believe the engine will provide the best evidence on the
cause of the separation.
   Boeing spokesman Tom Cole in Seattle noted the 727's three
engines are each designed to break off if sudden vibrations
threaten to tear a plane apart and the plane can continue with two
engines or even with one.
   The incident caused little disturbance to passengers and the
aircraft lost only 100 feet of altitude immediately following the
engine loss. Before the incident, engines had broken off Boeing
jets three times since 1985.
   In each case, the pilots landed the planes safely and without
injuries to passengers. But after the last two incidents, the
Federal Aviation Administration ordered emergency inspections of
the bolts holding the engines in place.

<HEAD>President Lowers Duties on Polish Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Friday granted Poland more
duty-free access to U.S. markets, saying the move will ``open the
door for investment, trade and the interaction of two free
peoples.''
   In a White House ceremony, Bush signed a proclamation which
should provide typical savings of between 3 and 10 percent for the
producers of Polish exports into the United States.
   The president's action qualified Poland for concessionary trade
rules known as the Generalized System of Preferences, under which
duties are lifted on about half of the products on the U.S. tariff
schedule. In Poland's case, the benefit would apply to about
one-fourth of the goods subject to duties it now sends to the
United States.
   ``This ... means that Polish exports will enjoy the most liberal
access possible to the American market,'' Bush said. ``And it will
pave the way for increases in Polish exports to the United States _
a vital contribution to Poland's economic recovery.''
   ``The past year has been one of outstanding change in Eastern
Europe,'' the president said. ``But it was the brave people of
Poland, under the banner of Solidarity, that led the way ... Poland
has blazed the trail _ the freedom trail.''
   Bush addressed a small audience that included Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, Trade Ambassador Carla Hills and Poland's
ambassador, Jan Kinast.
   In addition to the new trade concessions, Bush noted, the U.S.
government is committed to a three-year economic assistance program
to Poland totaling $1 billion and has already contributed $200
million in aid since last spring. The Western alliance has promised
more than $8 billion in economic aid to Poland over the three-year
period.
   Poland previously was granted most-favored-nation trading status
by the United States, meaning its products qualified for the lower
tariffs accorded U.S. allies. The new designation allows many of
those same goods to enter the country without paying the tariffs
charged developed countries on the most-favored-nation list.
   The concession does not guarantee sales in the United States,
but is designed to provide a savings margin that could prove
decisive on the American market and thus spur increased trading
activity. About $50 million in Polish goods already enter the
United States duty-free.
   Administration officials said that, by volume, the Polish
products likely to benefit the most include tractors and parts,
furniture, cutting tools, machine tools, titanium dioxide and
copper wire. Duties for those goods now range from 2.2 percent to
7.2 percent.
   The concession also would benefit several Polish products on
which high duties, ranging between 17 percent to 45 percent, now
are charged _ vodka and other alcoholic beverages, cork products,
Brussels sprouts, preserved vegetables, and clincial thermometers.
   Based on 1988 trade data, dutiable Polish products worth $73.3
million were imported into the United States in categories for
which tariffs now will be lifted. That would amount to a potential
savings, based on that year's volume, of $3.5 million.
   If Poland fully utilized its latest eligibility, its trading
volume under the concession would be estimated to rank with that of
Turkey, Zaire and Costa Rica.

<HEAD>Obscure Rebel Group Claims Western Ethiopian Town</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fighting has flared in western Ethiopia
where an obscure rebel group claims to have killed, captured or
wounded more than 1,200 government troops and seized a town along
the Sudanese border.
   The fighting has disrupted a U.N. refugee operation in the
region, according to relief officials, and comes at a time when the
government is engaged in heavy battles with northern insurgents.
   The Oromo Liberation Front, a loosely grouped insurgency that
draws its strength from the Oromo tribespeople across western,
central and southern Ethiopia, claims to have taken the town of
Asosa in fighting Tuesday.
   In a clandestine rebel broadcast monitored in Nairobi, the Oromo
rebels said they killed 957 government troops, wounded more than
200 and captured 117.
   Asosa is ``completely under control and the inhabitants have
been totally liberated from foreign oppression,'' said the
broadcast.
   Diplomats and other sources in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa,
could not confirm the rebel claims.
   However, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees said an unknown number of refugees had fled a UNHCR camp
about 18 miles from Asosa because of fighting and that the agency
had evacuated three employees from the area.
   The spokeswoman, Meryam Amar, said the agency had been unable to
get any details about the fighting or the refugees' flight because
the government was refusing to allow anyone to travel to the region.
   She said there had not been any disturbances in the region prior
to Tuesday's fighting.,
   ``It was sudden and brand new for us,'' she said.
   Asosa, 300 miles west of Addis Ababa, is the field office for
four UNHCR camps that house about 385,000 refugees who have fled
drought and war in southern Sudan.
   The camp near Asosa, Tsore, houses 41,219 refugees, a quarter of
whom have arrived in the last two months fleeing renewed fighting
in Sudan's civil war, said Amar.
   With the Oromo rebellion, ``the refugees are being caught
between the cross-fire for a second time,'' she said.
   The Oromo rebels, who advocate self-determination for the Oromo
people, have been fighting sporadically since the early 1970s.
Diplomats say their battles have more resembled tribal warfare than
organized dissidence and have tended to flare in patches and
pockets in western and central Ethiopia.
   Sources say the Oromo have been more of an irritant than a
threat. However, the recent battle comes at a time when the
government is concentrating its attention and troops on fighting
with Tigrean rebels who since August have made significant advances
from their northern province toward the capital.
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam's government also is facing food
emergencies in Tigre and its northern neighbor, Eritrea, where the
United Nations said crop failures threaten as many as 4 million
people with starvation.

   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army
claimed Friday it scored a major victory over government troops in
Western Equatoria by dispersing an army brigade of more than 3,000
soldiers.
   An SPLA radio broadcast, monitored in London, said the victory
came on Thursday near the border of Uganda and climaxed six days of
fighting in south Sudan. It said brigade commander Brig. Gen.
Isaiah Paul fled toward Uganda.
   The rebels now are pursuing the fleeing soldiers and conducting
mopping-up operations, it said.
   No casualties were reported.
   ``With the destruction of this force, the junta's backbone in
Western Equatoria has been effectively destroyed,'' the radio said,
referring to the 15-man junta that seized power in Sudan in a
military coup June 30.
   It said the brigade was the same force that entered Uganda on
Dec. 29 and overran the northwestern border town of Oraba.
   The SPLA engaged the brigade at Kirwa, four miles from the
Ugandan border, as the government soldiers crossed back into Sudan
on Dec. 30, the radio said. It said the brigade had advanced eight
miles when it was destroyed by the SPLA.
   Uganda said on Wednesday its troops retook Oraba last week after
three days of occupation by the Sudanese army.
   The SPLA launched its rebellion in early 1983, demanding greater
autonomy and economic reforms in the three southern provinces of
Bahr el-Ghazal, Upper Nile and Equatoria.

<HEAD>$1 Million Noriega Reward Likely to Go Unclaimed, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $1 million reward offered by President
Bush for information leading to the capture of deposed dictator
Manuel Antonio Noriega will apparently go unclaimed, admimistration
officials said on Friday.
   The administration had offered the bounty on Dec. 21, a day
after the U.S. invasion of Panama and while Noriega was still at
large.
   Deputy presidential spokesman Roman Popadiuk said that the
decision on what to do with the reward remains with the Justice and
State Departments, and not the White House. However, he said he
believed that the bounty would probably go unclaimed.
   Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., said Friday in a letter to
Bush that the papal nuncio in Panama, Monsignor Jose Sebastian
Laboa, deserved the reward because he persuaded Noriega to
surrender.
   ``I am sure Monsignor Laboa has many worthy projects that could
use some infusions of cash,'' Broomfieldl said.
   A senior administration official, who briefed reporters at the
White House on Thursday on the condition of anonymity, shrugged off
a question on whether the Vatican might qualify for the reward.
   ``I don't know. I'll tell you Monday when the collection plate
comes around,'' he said.
   Administration officials, who asked not to be identified, said
the Vatican probably wouldn't qualify for the reward because its
role in Noriega's surrender was an indirect one.
   Noriega was
   holed up in the Vatican embassy from Christmas Eve until this
past Wednesday when he surrendered to U.S. forces.
   In addition to the as-yet unclaimed $1 million, the
administration also has been paying $150 per-weapon to Panamanians
who turn in their firearms.

   Susan Eisenhower, granddaughter of President
Dwight Eisenhower, said Friday she will marry an adviser to Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Roald Z. Sagdeev, a rocket
scientist and political reformer.
   They will be married in a Feb. 9 civil ceremony in Moscow and
then will be ``blessed'' at a religious ceremony at the U.S.
Embassy there, Sagdeev said in a telephone interview from
Washington.
   Sagdeev, a Volga Tatar, said he has ``no religious assignment;''
Miss Eisenhower is a Protestant.
   The couple will maintain two homes, living in Washington with
Miss Eisenhower's three school-age children during the fall and
spring, and spending summers in Moscow, said Sagdeev, 57. He said
he has two grown children.
   They met 2{ years ago, and the romance blossomed while they
collaborated on a book about ``survival, how a very thin layer of
intellectuals survived through difficult years, through purges,''
before Gorbachev rose to power in 1985, Sagdeev said.
   The first draft of the book is finished, he said.
   Miss Eisenhower, 38, was not immediately available for comment
on the wedding, which she announced through the Eisenhower World
Affairs Institute. She is the daughter of John Eisenhower. Her
brother, David, is married to Julie Nixon Eisenhower.
   The marriage will be Miss Eisenhower's third, said a friend of
the family. Her first husband was London barrister, Alexander
Bradshaw, with whom she had one daughter. Her second husband was
John Mahon, an attorney in Rochester, N.Y., the father of her two
youngest daughters.
   Sagdeev is thought to have Gorbachev's ear on a range of
scientific issues, and has said that he offered the Soviet leader
advice on Star Wars, which Sagdeev opposes.
   Sagdeev was elected to the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies
last year, and was a political ally of the late Andrei D. Sakharov,
even when Sakharov was banished from Moscow for his human rights
activities.
   Soviet and U.S. scientists say Sagdeev quietly supported
Sakharov during his exile.
   Sagdeev said he met Sakharov three decades ago, when both were
engaged in secret research, and admired his work on controlled
thermonuclear fusion.
   ``I witnessed his gradual shift toward a broader view of the
world and life. He became interested in arms control and then human
rights,'' Sagdeev said.
   ``When he was under strong attack, when every member of (the
Soviet Academy of Sciences) was pressed to denounce him in the
mid-1970s, I had to ask myself whether I would be drawn into such
condemnation or stay independent. It was very important as a moral
step in my life, which liberated me from the conformism of that
period,'' Sagdeev said.
   A portion of the planned book will deal with Sakharov, he said.
   Miss Eisenhower, who has been active in promoting U.S.-Soviet
ties, was formerly president of the Eisenhower World Affairs
Institute and now heads her own consulting company, the Eisenhower
Group Inc., which handles commercial ventures for major U.S.
companies dealing with the Soviet Union.
   She served as co-chairman of the 1986 Chautauqua Conference in
the Lativian city of Riga in the Soviet Union, one of the early
testing grounds for Gorbachev's policy of glasnost.
   Sagdeev recently resigned as head of the Soviet Space Research
Institute. He criticized the Soviet space program, among other
things, for concentrating on a new space shuttle. He continues to
work as head of the institute's Theory Division.

   A madam who admits furnishing call girls to
wealthy clients shouldn't be prosecuted because she helped police
track down a terrorist and reported on drug and sex criminals, her
lawyer said Friday.
   Elizabeth Adams claims she and police had an arrangement by
which they would ignore her business if she supplied law
enforcement with valued information garnered from clients through
``pillow talk.''
   Ms. Adams, 56, has been called the Beverly Hills Madam because
many of her clients allegedly booked trysts in posh Beverly Hills
hotel suites. Prosecutors claim some of her clients were famous.
   Defense attorney Anthony P. Brooklier contends prosecutors don't
have a case against Ms. Adams, who faces two felony counts of
pimping and pandering, since the police department encouraged his
client to continue her operation in exchange for inside information.
   In court documents, Ms. Adams is said to have cooperated in
investigations of fugitives including financier Robert Vesco, who
was being sought on federal charges. Vesco is the only felon
mentioned.
   A U.S. Senate subcommittee investigating Vesco's activities
mentioned that Ms. Adams acted as a police ``agent,'' according to
court documents that did not elaborate on her relationship to Vesco.
   At a pretrial hearing Friday, police Detective Mike Brambles
described Ms. Adams as ``extremely reliable.'' He said she supplied
him with valuable information, including the identity of an Irish
Republican Army terrorist allegedly planning to bomb the British
Parliament.
   The detective also testified that Ms. Adams identified a number
of people involved in child molestation and child pornography, and
that she gave information on drug dealers, including some the Drug
Enforcement Administration classified as top traffickers.
   Deputy District Attorney Alan Carter, who is pressing for a
prison term, asked Brambles to name the IRA terrorist but the
witness refused to divulge the name.
   Ms. Adams, who came from Manila about two decades ago, said she
was a mother and a widow until she was approached by an ``English
madam'' who offered her a client book.

   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn said Friday
that Comecon, the Soviet bloc's version of the European Common
Market, is too expensive and must be remodeled.
   He also defended the visit to Hungary this week of the South
African foreign minister, R.F. Botha.
   ``Comecon is not only unsuitable to meet its tasks, but also
costs too much in its present form,'' Horn told a news conference.
``It needs a total overhaul.''
   When asked about similar views expressed in a Polish newspaper
interview by Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier of Czechoslovakia, he
said: ``Hungary agrees that there is a need for radical reform,''
   A conference of Comecon, the Council for Mutual Economic
Assistance, is scheduled for Tuesday in Sofia, Bulgaria.
   About the Botha visit, Horn said preparatory talks spanned three
months and ``the South African side offered to have the foreign
minister pay Hungary a visit on an unofficial basis.''
   ``We assessed the changes in South Africa and saw that the
dismantling of apartheid has begun,'' he said. ``Our talks with
Botha were important. We made clear that we oppose apartheid and
that its total end is the precondition to diplomatic recognition.''
   ``At the same time, the meeting offered an opportunity to have
direct contact with South African political and business circles,
and we were also led by the consideration that there are over
10,000 people of Hungarian origin living in South Africa.''
   Noting criticism of Hungary by some black African states, Horn
said similar circumstances had arisen after the government
recognized South Korea and Israel.
   He said he would visit Israel next week. Horn said Hungary
supports a Middle East settlement that guarantees Israel's security
while recognizing the right of Palestinians to self-determination
and statehood.

   A reputed Harlem crack dealer may have been
murdered while trying to negotiate the return of his kidnapped
12-year-old brother, whose severed finger accompanied a ransom
demand, police sources said Friday.
   The body of Richard Thomas Porter, 25, was found in the Bronx
early Thursday. He had been shot several times, but investigators
who found identification and $2,239.78 on the body discounted
robbery as a motive.
   ``There is a possibility that this guy was trying to
re-negotiate the return (of his brother) without the police,'' said
a source close to the investigation, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Porter, reputedly a mid-level drug dealer who controlled several
street dealers in Harlem, had refused to cooperate with police
investigating his brother's kidnapping, the sources said.
   Porter's brother, William, was abducted Dec. 5 on his way school
and is still missing, police said. ``There's no indication that we
have that this kid was anything more than a schoolboy,'' a source
said.
   The family learned of the abduction later that day when when
William called home around 5 p.m. and tearfully told his mother he
had been kidnapped.
   Four hours later, a male caller warned the family not to call
police, but made no ransom demand.
   The following day, the family received a call demanding
$500,000. Later the same day, a caller asked to speak with Richard
Porter, and told Porter he would settle for $350,000 for the boy's
return.
   At 4 p.m. on Dec. 6, the kidnapper told the family to go to a
McDonald's restaurant at 125th Street and Broadway and look under
the sink in the men's room.
   There, a friend of the family found an audio cassette, a
two-inch piece of a finger, believed to belong to William, and two
of William's rings in a coffee cup, the sources said.
   ``They cutted my finger off. ... They said if you don't do as
they say, they are going to cut my hand off,'' William said on the
tape, according to a report published in the Daily News. ``Please
help ... I love you, mommy.''
   The kidnapper called the family again at 9 p.m. on Dec. 6 and
repeated the demand for $350,000. Porter offered the man $200,000,
the police sources said.
   The man did not call back.
   The family's last contact with the kidnappers was Dec. 10, when
a woman handed a ransom note to a child in upper Manhattan and told
him to deliver it to William's aunt, who lived nearby.
   According to the News, the note read: ``We still want the money.
The child is in pain and he needs medical attention.''
   Police officials refused to comment on the kidnapping case so as
not to jeopardize William's safety.
   The sources said it appeared the kidnapper or kidnappers knew
the family. ``They knew the brother, the mother and an aunt,'' a
source said. ``It had to be someone who knew about the family.''
   The family's telephone number is unlisted.
   Sixty city detectives were assigned to the abduction case, which
also is being investigated by the FBI.
   Detectives also have been following leads that Porter may have
been involved in a turf war over control of the area's lucrative
drug trade, and that he may have been having an argument with a
relative who was recently released from prison, the sources said.

<HEAD>Cabinet Shake-Up Aims at Boosting Mexican Tourism, Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ISAAC A. LEVI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari completed
an overhaul of his Cabinet Friday aimed at further developing
tourism and boosting agricultural production, two of Mexico's
principal money-earners.
   A surprise announcement Thursday evening said Agriculture
Secretary Jorge de la Vega Dominguez was named a special adviser to
Salinas and Tourism Secretary Carlos Hank Gonzalez, 63, would take
over agriculture.
   Former Gov. Pedro Joaquin Coldwell, 40, of Quintana Roo state in
the Yucatan, was named tourism secretary on Friday.
   Hank's appointment was hailed by business leaders, who have been
fretting that rising food prices and lagging production from
Mexico's antiquated farms and ranches was fueling inflation and
eroding export income.
   President Eduardo Garcia Suarez of the National Chamber of
Commerce urged Hank to lift existing prices controls and ``pave the
way to attract new investments in agriculture so as to raise
productivity.''
   One major problem, which every government has ducked in the 60
years the Institutional Revolutionary Party has been in power, is
the so-called ``ejido'' system, under which entire villages own
land that the villagers work in small parcels but by law cannot be
sold or merged.
   The system was revived by the 1910-20 revolution, which called
for ``land for everyone who works it.'' Land expropriations and
agrarian reform continued until the early 1980s, but now the
government says there is no more land to expropriate.
   Mexico, once a net exporter of agricultural products, has been
increasingly relying on purchases of wheat, corn and other
foodstuffs abroad to feed its growing population and make up for
shortfalls in domestic production.
   It now spends close to $3 billion a year on these imports.
   Salinas pledged to modernize Mexico from top to bottom when he
was inaugurated Dec. 1, 1988, for a six-year term.
   Word has circulated around government halls that the agrarian
reform and the agriculture departments will soon be merged under
Hank.
   In his one year as tourism secretary, Hank lined up Japanese,
Western European and Canadian investors, helped privatize and
deregulate the airline industry and laid out plans to build new
hotels and resorts in a program to double the number of tourists
coming to Mexico by 1994.
   About 6 million foreign tourists now visiting Mexico annually
spend an estimated $3 billion a year.
   Coldwell, a businessman and former congressman, moved up from
being chairman of the National Tourism Fund, a government
organization that helps finance development of tourism facilities.
   He helped turn Cancun off the Yucatan into one of the
Caribbean's leading luxury beach resorts.

<TEXT>
   More than 720,000 ethnic Germans
resettled in West Germany in 1989, nearly half of them from East
Germany, the Interior Ministry said Friday.
   It was the largest immigration of ethnic Germans to West Germany
in the country's 40-year history. The largest group were young,
skilled workers fleeing East Germany at the start of the
pro-democracy movement last year.
   The Interior Ministry said 343,854 East Germans arrived in West
Germany. In 1988, the number was 39,832.
   The number of arrivals of ethnic Germans from other Eastern
European countries last year was 377,055, the ministry said,
compared with 202,673 in 1988.
   Of this year's emigrants, 250,340 came from Poland, 93,134 from
the Soviet Union, and 23,387 from Romania. The remainder came from
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia, the ministry report said.
   East Germans and ethnic East European Germans resettling in West
Germany are automatically granted citizenship.
   The flood of East Germans to West Germany began last summer
after Hungary began dismantling its border barriers with Austria,
prompting East Germans to cross from Hungary through Austria to the
West.
   Tens of thousands of East Germans seeking legal passage to West
Germany then began crowding West German embassies in Hungary,
Poland and Czechoslovakia.
   The exodus and subsequent pro-democracy rallies drew hundreds of
thousands to the streets of major East German cities and forced the
opening of the borders.

<HEAD>Attorneys Meet With Noriega, Say No Deals Discussed</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto MH4</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense attorneys met for two hours Friday with
deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega and later denied
reports that a deal was in the works with the U.S. government.
   As military helicopters circled above the federal courthouse in
downtown Miami, defense attorneys Frank Rubino and Steven Kollin
met inside with Noriega and discussed legal options.
   ``His demeanor is fine,'' Rubino said of the 51-year-old
Noriega. ``He's cheerful and very relaxed. ... Most of the time we
spent discussing the case and its ramifications.''
   ``He has no complaints,'' added Kollin.
   The attorneys declined to discuss the details of their legal
discussions, but Kollin said there were no plans to make a deal
with the government on the drug trafficking charges faced by
Noriega.
   ``A man who is innocent is not receptive to any plea bargain.
General Noriega is not guilty of any of these charges,'' Kollin
said.
   In Washington, President Bush said Friday the government's case
is strong and he is also ``not seeking a deal'' on a reduced charge
for Noriega.
   ``We are preparing for trial,'' said Justice Department
spokesman David Runkel. He wouldn't rule out any discussion of a
deal if Noriega came forward, but stressed, ``There is no
indication of anything along those lines.''
   The New York Times, citing a senior administration official,
reported Friday that ``the government would be prepared to discuss
a negotiated settlement if General Noriega provided detailed
information about international drug trafficking activities.''
   Noriega reportedly spent Thursday night inside the courthouse.
Officials have been extraordinarily quiet about security
precautions taken in the Noriega case.
   The Miami Herald quoted government sources as saying Noriega was
housed in in a room so secret that the Marshals Service will not
confirm its existence: A 10-by-12 room called the ``submarine,''
under the old courthouse.
   Tunnels connect the old section with the new building, where
Noriega faced U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler on Thursday
in a ninth-floor courtroom.
   The isolated room has a bed, a television and a toilet, the
Herald said. The door is not visible to occupants, who usually are
participants under the Federal Witness Protection Program.
   Noriega, who surrendered to U.S. troops in Panama City on
Wednesday night, is charged with taking $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to turn his nation into a way
station for the cocaine trade.
   Noriega is also charged on a separate indictment in Tampa for
alleged marijuana-smuggling activities.
   Kollin said Thursday he had heard ``some talk about about moving
him to Tampa'' to deal with court proceedings awaiting him there.
But later Kollin said he'd found nothing to support the Tampa
rumors.
   ``We don't think they're going to move him in the immediate
future,'' Kollin said. ``The marshals are being very nice and
cooperative and they have assured us he will be available whenever
we want to talk to him.''
   Federal officials in Tampa said they knew of no plans to bring
Noriega there to deal with the marijuana indictment.
   No decision will be made regarding the Tampa case until the
Miami case is disposed of, said Doug Tillett, spokesman for the
Justice Department.
   Both attorneys also met with the prosecutors and with
representatives of the U.S. Marshal's office.
   In another development, a federal magistrate Friday ordered an
alleged Noriega pilot named in the indictment to be held without
bond in pretrial detention, despite his attorney's claim that he is
not a risk of flight.
   Michael O'Kane, a Fort Lauderdale attorney representing
36-year-old Daniel Miranda, argued that the charge against Miranda
of flying $800,000 in drug proceeds from Fort Lauderdale to Panama
in 1983 carried a maximum sentence of only five years.
   O'Kane said he would appeal the magistrate's ruling to Hoeveler,
the trial judge.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev put off meetings
with foreign guests Friday to concentrate on domestic crises, and
news of it unsettled Wall Street and caused a steep decline in the
Tokyo stock market.
   Among the foreign visitors affected was Neil Kinnock, leader of
the opposition socialist Labor Party in Britain. A senior Communist
Party official said privately Gorbachev was dealing with border
riots in Azerbaijan and the breakaway Communist Party of Lithuania.
   Soviet media did not report the schedule change, but it was felt
abroad.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange recorded its sharpest drop since Oct.
16, plummeting 438.12 points.
   Analysts blamed concern about Gorbachev's fate. A slight decline
in stock prices on Wall Street and a steep drop on the Hong Kong
exchange were attributed to the same cause.
   ``To Japan, the worst thing that could happen to the world
scenario would be for Gorbachev to drop from sight,'' Chris
Schreiber, an investment analyst with New Japan Securities, said in
Tokyo.
   The market reactions illustrated how closely the capitalist
world links Gorbachev to the success of the reforms and improved
East-West relations he has pursued since gaining power in March
1985.
   In London, Foreign Office minister William Waldegrave said on
Channel 4 News: ``It is in our interests that current Soviet
foreign policy should be maintained, and we should therefore
respond imaginatively and positively to what he is trying to do.
   ``He is going in the right direction and we want him to survive.
He still dominates the political scene. He has shown himself
willing to be open to new ideas.''
   The party official in Moscow asked about Western news reports
that Gorbachev had postponed meetings with Kinnock and other
foreign dignitaries, replied: ``It's right. We have many problems
right now.''
   He mentioned disturbances in Azerbaijan along the Iranian border
and the Lithuanian Communist Party's decision to break away from
the ruling national party led by Gorbachev.
   Soviet Azerbaijanis tried over the New Year's holiday to force
open the frontier and reunite with their ethnic brethren in Iran,
tearing down guard towers and prompting the KGB to reinforce
security along the frontier. Fences remain flattened and other
barriers out of commission along the border, Soviet TV reported
Friday night.
   Gorbachev is expected to travel to Lithuania next week on a
mission from the national party's Central Committee to try to mend
the rift with the Lithuanian Communists. They voted two weeks ago
to split off from the 20 million-member ruling party and pursue
local independence, and Lithuanian party leaders who met with
Gorbachev for five hours Thursday said he failed to sway them from
their decision.
   A dissenting faction of Lithuanian Communists who voted to
remain loyal to Moscow were on their way to the capital Friday to
meet with party leaders, said Eduardas Potashinskas, a Lithuanian
TV journalist.
   Meanwhile, the Estonian Communist Party threw its support to the
Lithuanians in the dispute with Moscow, reports said Friday. The
Estonian party's Central Committee meeting Thursday set March 23
for a session of its own full congress, which is expected to vote
on a similar proposal to split from the Soviet party, Estonian
journalist Tarmu Tammerk said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, in a telephone
interview, would neither confirm nor deny that Gorbachev was
putting aside foreign questions to concentrate on domestic problems.
   Asked about a report from London that the Soviet ambassador to
Britain, Leonid Zamyatin, had told Kinnock that Gorbachev was
postponing a Jan. 16 meeting with Kinnock and all other contacts
with foreign politicians this month, Gerasimov replied: ``Has this
meeting been planned? Let The Associated Press compose its own
commentary. For me this is all clear. Let them comment on that as
they wish.''
   Gorbachev's calendar is rarely made public, and whenever he
disappears from the public eye, speculation about his activities
and even his health becomes rife. He scoffed at such
rumor-mongering this summer at the first session of the Congress of
People's Deputies.
   ``Let's end these rumors,'' he said. ``In four years, I have
already died seven times and my family was killed three times.''
   Gorbachev, 58, was last seen on state-run TV on Dec. 31
delivering a taped address to the nation. Moscow-based official
media did not report on his closed-door meeting Thursday with the
Lithuanians.
   In London, a Labor Party spokesman said Zamyatin had delivered a
personal message from Gorbachev to Kinnock, who had been scheduled
to visit Moscow for talks with the Soviet leader. The message said
the meeting had to be postponed because ``political events in the
Soviet Union'' required Gorbachev's ``personal attention and
participation,'' and that he was ``postponing contact with foreign
politicians scheduled for January.''

<HEAD>10 Palestinians Wounded, Activist Barred from Traveling Abroad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli troops shot and wounded 10 Palestinians
in stone-throwing clashes in the occupied lands Friday as
authorities barred a leading pro-PLO activist from traveling abroad.
   The three-month travel ban against Feisal Husseini was issued by
Interior Minister Arye Deri late Thursday, Israel radio and Arab
reports said.
   In the document, dated Jan. 3, Deri wrote that he decided on the
step because he was convinced Husseini's departure abroad ``may
harm the security of the state,'' the Israeli news agency Itim said.
   The ban followed the Dec. 6 restriction barring Husseini from
entering the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip for six months.
   Husseini, who lives in the Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, has
been named in court documents as a leader of the two-year-old
Palestinian uprising.
   He could not be reached for comment Friday.
   However, in an interview published Friday in East Jerusalem's
Arabic-language daily Al-Fajr, Husseini said in response to the ban
that ``instead of tackling the issue of peace, Israel is behaving
to contradict the peaceful efforts.''
   ``The problem is not what countries Feisal Husseini can go to,
it is the degree of Israel's readiness for peace,'' he said.
   In stone-throwing clashes in six villages and refugee camps in
the occupied territories, meanwhile, Israeli troops shot and
wounded 10 Palestinians, Arab hospital officials said. The army
confirmed two wounded.
   At least 642 Palestinians have died in the revolt, and 43
Israelis have been slain by Palestinians, who have also murdered
166 of their fellow Arabs for being suspected collaborators.

   Doris Straka has cared for the chickens,
ducks, rabbits and cats abandoned by her former neighbor, a
religious cult leader, since he and his wife disappeared from their
farmhouse in April.
   She was stunned to learn that Jeffrey Lundgren may have left
something else behind: buried bodies.
   ``Oh, gracious, it's unreal,'' said Ms. Straka, 44, who lives
across the street from the farmhouse rented by Lundgren in this
town of 6,000 people in northeast Ohio, about 30 miles east of
Cleveland. ``Yesterday I was numb.''
   Authorities, acting on a tip from an anonymous informer,
discovered the bodies of five family members in a mass grave on the
property. Lundgren, 39, his wife Alice, 38, and 11 other people
assumed to be members of his religious commune have been charged
with murder or conspiracy.
   ``It's terrible. This is a small town, and it affects everyone.
There's a real mixture of people out here, and that's what makes it
a nice community,'' said Jim Zarobila, owner of Cinema Transit
Video in Kirtland.
   Lundgren and his wife are still being sought, said George
Rodriguez of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in
Kansas City, Mo. Seven others have been arrested.
   Rodriguez said the five dead were identified tentatively as
Dennis Avery, 49; his wife, Cheryl, 42; and their three daughters,
Trina, 13; Rebecca, 9; and Karen, 5.
   Glen Blabolil, assistant to the superintendent of Kirtland
schools, said a Lake County crisis intervention team has been
assembled to help students cope with the news.
   ``There are a few students upset. But they only knew the Averys
a few years. They kind of kept to themselves,'' he said.
   Rodriguez said the Averys were members of a splinter religious
group led by Lundgren, a former lay minister of the Reorganized
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which is based in
Independence, Mo.
   The Cleveland Plain Dealer, quoting unidentified police sources,
said the five may have been killed as part of a religious sacrifice.
   Dale Luffman, president of the northeast Ohio chapter of the
church, said he believed the killings may have resulted from a
dispute over money, sex or fear that the Averys wanted to leave the
cult and would notify authorities about it.

<HEAD>Peru Violence Worsens, Claimed Average of 9 Lives a Day in 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An average of nine people died every day in
1989, most of them civilians caught up in Peru's political
violence, in the worst year of the 10-year-old guerrilla war,
according to a report Friday.
   The report by a Senate human rights commission put last year's
death toll from politically inspired violence at 3,198, a steep
rise from the 1988 figure of 1,986.
   ``Peru is definitely a sick country,'' said Sen. Enrique
Bernales, chairman of the commission, whose reports are considered
one of the most reliable sources of information on Peru's civil
unrest.
   Shining Path rebels have been fighting to topple Peruvian
governments since 1980. Other anti-government groups include the
pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement and the Rodrigo Franco
Command, a paramilitary death squad believed linked to radicals in
the governing, center-left Aprista party.
   Bernales said 1989 was costliest year since the violence began.
He estimated damage to the country last year at $3.2 billion,
including a half-billion dollars because of attacks on Peru's
hydroelectric power grid.
   Economic damage to the country since 1980 were put at more than
$15 billion.
   The report said of the 3,198 deaths last year, 1,251 were
rebels, 348 were members of security forces, 149 were drug
traffickers, and 1,450 were civilians. Among the civilian deaths
were 52 mayors killed by rebel groups.
   At a press conference at which he presented the report, Bernales
displayed a map of Peru showing areas where guerrilla groups
operate. He said the Shining Path had spread its influence in 1989,
but that the Tupac Amaru's area of operations had shrunk.
   However, he said this was the first year the commission had
recorded deaths by unidentified terrorist groups _ 153.
   ``Either Peru resolves to end this violence problem or it will
become another Lebanon,'' Bernales said.

the decision-making process.
   Koeszeg said they also had documents allegedly concerning other
opposition groups and that he had already been in touch with Jozsef
Antall, the head of the Hungarian Democratic Forum.
   The Free Democrats and FIDESZ said they had requested the state
prosecutor's office began an investigation and criminal proceedings
against ``persons unknown'' for violating the constitution and the
penal code.
   Premier Miklos Nemeth later urged prosecutors to investigate the
charges.
   Through the state news agency MTI, Nemeth issued a statement
condemning ``all illegal activities, including the methods formerly
employed by the state security organization.''
   Hungary's security organs regularly monitored dissident
activities during four decades of Communist rule but the reforms in
Hungary and throughout the East bloc since last year have caused
many of those operations to cease.
   Earlier, the Free Democrats and FIDESZ had demanded in an open
letter to Nemeth that Interior Minister Istvan Horvath resign and
two top security officials be suspended.
   One of the officials whose suspension was demanded, Deputy
Interior Minister Ferenc Pallagi, who is in charge of the state
security said in an interview with a Budapest daily last November
that his department was ``not concerned with the legitimate
alternative organizations.''
   The letter called on the premier to ``make public what
organizations and which people were privy to the information (and
to) ... impound immediately all such documents.''
   Nemeth's statement said the government was drafting legislation
to redefine the state security networks' duties.

<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Republican James McClure of Idaho, a
critic of gun control and federal efforts to bar development of
western lands, announced Friday he will retire when his third term
ends next year.
   ``I would rather leave than have people ask me to,'' the
65-year-old conservative joked at a news conference. He was
considered all but unbeatable if he had gone for a fourth term.
   McClure said, however, he would not run for reelection in 1990.
His term expires in 1991.
   McClure is top Republican on the Interior and Natural Resources
Committee and is a member of the Appropriations Committee. He was
elected to three terms in the House before moving to the Senate in
1972.
   He and Rep. Harold Volkmer, D-Mo., were chief sponsors of a
measure that became law in 1986 that substantially eased federal
gun control laws. He also fought a number of battles with advocates
of barring development of wilderness areas.
   The announcement was expected to touch off an intense round of
Idaho politicking. Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, was believed set to
announce for the Senate nomination next week and Republican
Attorney General Jim Jones also indicated he planned to enter the
race.
   Democratic Rep. Richard Stallings said he was considering the
possibility.
   On Capitol Hill, a Democratic spokeswoman said McClure's
retirement makes the Idaho Senate race this year competitive for
Democrats.
   ``The Republicans are now defending three open seats; three more
than we are,'' said Anita Dunn, spokeswoman for the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee.
   She noted that Sens. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., and William
Armstrong, R-Colo., also have decided not to seek reelection.
   ``Now Repupblicans will be spending time, attention and money in
a state where they had intended to spend none,'' she said.
   After initially winning his seat, McClure was re-elected twice
with only token opposition.

<HEAD>Settlement Near in Dispute Over Home for Mentally Retarded Adults</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO HEIGHTS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed group home for mentally
retarded adults that prompted discrimination lawsuits against this
Chicago suburb will likely be given the go-ahead, officials said.
   The Justice Department and the developer sued, charging the city
disciminated when turning down a permit request for the home.
   The developer, Residential Facilities Management Services, and
the suburb are ``close to a settlement'' that will resolve the case
and allow construction of the home, City Attorney James Creswell
said.
   Attorneys for the two sides expect to submit a written agreement
Jan. 16, they told U.S. District Judge William Hart on Thursday.
   ``Our hope is we may have reached some accommodation by next
week,'' said attorney Richard Friedman for the developer in
Galesburg, in western Illinois.
   The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the city June 20,
seeking an injunction to allow the project to proceed. It was the
first case brought by the government under the Fair Housing
Amendments Act, enacted March 12 to bar housing discrimination
against the handicapped.
   The developer filed its own federal lawsuit June 21.
   Cresswell, who is not directly involved in the negotiations,
said Thursday he did not know whether the home would be built on
the original site in a residential neighborhood in this community
of about 32,000 people.
   But Friedman said there are no other residential sites available
that are large enough for the home. Company officials said they
face a June 30 deadline for exercising their option to buy the
property.
   Creswell and Mayor Charles Panici were not in their offices
Friday afternoon and could not be reached for comment on the
proposed settlement.
   City Council last May denied a special-use permit for the home,
which is to house 15 mentally retarded adults. An attorney
representing the city later said the permit was denied because the
developer's application was deficient.
   Group homes for the handicapped, usually established in
residential neighborhoods, are designed to encourage independence.
Residents live under supervision, but are given greater
responsibility for everyday decisions.
   The lawsuits contend the council denied the permit because of
opposition from residents based on fear and prejudice against the
mentally retarded.
   The mayor's office, in a release last June, noted there are two
day-care and special-education centers for the developmentally
disabled in the city.
   ``The record of the City of Chicago Heights and its citizens in
the area of assisting the mentally handicapped is outstanding,''
the release said.``We are not an insensitive community, unfeeling
and uncaring when it comes to those less fortunate than we.''

<HEAD>Report: Free Parliamentary Elections by June</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communists and the country's
sanctioned opposition groups decided at round-table talks Friday
that free elections should be held by June, the state news agency
CTK said.
   Civic Forum, the umbrella opposition group now governing in
coalition with the Communists and other official parties, has been
pressing for June elections to the 350-member parliament, which
remains dominated by the Communists despite reforms that resulted
in the ascension of Vaclav Havel to the presidency.
   Havel, a banned playwright, had been jailed for five years by
the Communists before the reforms that have changed Eastern Europe
since last year propelled him to the leadership of Czechoslovakia.
   Some Communist leaders also have talked of elections in the
first half of 1990, but Friday's action appeared to mark the first
time a time has been set at the round table, a forum used to create
the coalition government and decide political events after
President Gustav Husak stepped down Dec. 10.
   The Communists, opposition and permitted official parties such
as the Socialists attended the round table, which is to meet next
on Jan. 11, CTK said.
   In a brief statement after the talks, CTK said participants had
discussed a draft constitutional law on recalling and electing
parliamentary deputies, and reviewed first drafts of a law on
staging free elections.
   It was decided ``that elections to the highest legislative
bodies should take place still in the first half of 199O,'' CTK
added.
   No specific date was given.
   ``Elections to local representative bodies should take place
later, after the necessary political climate in the society is
created,'' CTK said without elaborating.
   While the opposition and other political parties no longer
subservient to the Communists are in government on the federal
level, there have not yet been significant leadership changes on
local levels in Czechoslovakia, one of several East bloc countries
undergoing political and economic reforms.
   Last Dec. 10, a government controlled by non-Communists took
power for the first time in 41 years. The next day, Army units
began pulling down the Iron Curtain border with neutral Austria.

   Leaders of the black community Friday harshly
criticized the investigation of a white couple's shootings in an
inner-city neighborhood, saying police were too willing to believe
a black man was to blame.
   They accused police and the media of giving less attention to
black crime victims and charged police abused residents of the
Misson Hill neighborhood where Charles and Carol Stuart were found
shot in their car last October.
   Stuart told police a black assailant fired the shots, killing
his pregnant wife and critically wounding him. Stuart committed
suicide Thursday after his brother implicated him in the shootings.
   ``People wanted to believe that African-Americans and the
African-American community are mad-dog killers and this is not
true,'' said Rep. Gloria Fox, who spoke at the first of two news
conferences held Friday by community leaders.
   At the second meeting, the Rev. Grayland Ellis-Hagler said
police have a ``lynch mob mentality'' toward black suspects.
   ``We can not forget a police department and a commissioner who
so readily used Gestapo tactics against the black community,'' he
said.
   On Friday, Mayor Raymond L. Flynn reiterated that he regretted
the negative publicity surrounding the Stuart incident and that,
``believe it or not I'm sad for the city of Boston.''
   No one was ever charged in the Stuart case but a black man held
on an unrelated charge had been repeatedly mentioned in news
accounts as the likely suspect. Police cleared him in the case on
Thursday.
   Sadiki Kambon, director of the Black Community Information
Center in the Roxbury neighborhood, said the man was jailed
``because of his skin color and the Boston police's need for a
victim to satisfy the hunger of white racism in Boston and
America.''
   Asked later to comment on the allegation, police spokeman Scott
Gillis said the police commissioner had no immediate comment Friday.
   Paul Leary, Suffolk County assistant district attorney, denied
police ignored evidence implicating Stuart, saying ``there was no
corrobative evidence or any forensic evidence or anything at that
time that would have led the police to believe that his story was
other than what he had stated it to be.''
   Kambon also complained of allegedly abusive behavior by police
in searches of black residents during the investigation. He said
police must learn to ``respect us as human beings. If I'm walking
down the street with my daughter, don't come up to me and ask me
who I am.''
   At Mohammad's Mosque, black politicians and religious leaders
delivered impassioned speeches, punctuated by frequent applause and
shouts from the audience of about 60 people.
   The Rev. Don Muhammad, a minister at the church, said he
rejected any apologies from city officials.
   ``An apology is nothing. That's like stabbing me in the back,
pulling the knife out and saying you're sorry,'' he said over a
wave of applause.
   Pastor Mickarl Thomas compared the situation in Boston with the
racial tensions in Alabama during the civil rights era.
   ``Thirty-five years ago my people were walking the streets of
Montgomery, Alabama. Today in Boston we're not much better as we go
into the next decade,'' he said. ``When black men are afraid to put
on their jogging suits and go out and jog because they might be
arrested or accused, something is wrong.''

   The first Vietnamese allowed to
resettle in the United States after paying for helping the
Americans in the Vietnam War with years in Communist
``re-education'' camps stopped here Friday en route to their new
lives.
   Three chartered jets brought the first 156 former camp inmates
and their families to Bangkok from Ho Chi Minh City, formerly
Saigon, on Friday and 151 more were expected Saturday.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher expressed pleasure on
hearing the news in Washington and said the administration hopes at
least 7,000 former detainees and their kin will be resettled in the
United States by Sept. 30.
   Nearly 2,000 Vietnamese, including family members, are scheduled
to leave their homeland by March, said Richard Kocher, head of the
Thailand office of the International Organization For Migration.
His agency handles medical processing and transportation of the
refugees.
   ``I have come to the free world,'' said former army officer
Nguyen Thuong Hiep after arriving at Bangkok airport with his wife
and two children. ``Everyone loves their country, but our country
suffers, as you know. We do wish to come back sometime.''
   The two young daughters of another former officer wore white
lace dresses and red hair ribbons in celebration.
   ``I cannot say how happy I am after all these years,'' said
Nguyen Cao Son, who taught at a military academy. He spent three
years in a re-education camp, then three years in jail for trying
to flee the country by boat.
   Hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese were subjected for years to
a spartan regimen of manual labor and political study for serving
the U.S.-backed government of South Vietnam, which fell in April
1975.
   A U.S. source in Bangkok has said Washington believes about
100,000 former camp inmates are among the 600,000 Vietnamese who
have applied to emigrate to the United States. He said the
Vietnamese government estimates former inmates and their families
total 550,000 people.
   Vietnam has freed hundreds of the prisoners in recent years, and
Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach had said in June only about 120
people remained interned.
   An agreement on resettling former camp inmates was reached in
July. The U.S. negotiator, senior State Department official Robert
L. Funseth, said at the time it would help heal ``the last big
wound remaining from the war.''
   Many of those who arrived Friday will join relatives in
California and other parts of the United States after a few days in
a Thai immigration facility.
   Nguyen Van So has been trying to join his sister in Oklahoma
since he was freed in 1981 after six years years of confinement. He
said conditions in the camps were ``very, very bad. It was hard
labor.''
   Ho Van Phuoc, a helicopter pilot who flew hundreds of missions
during the war, said he saw about 25 people shot for trying to flee
a re-education camp and many others died of disease.
   Some family members of the former inmates were not as happy to
leave home. ``It is very sad to be separated,'' said Nguyen Hoang
Bich Van, 18, who left her boyfriend behind.
   The refugees said people in Vietnam were following the
pro-democracy movements in Eastern Europe closely and hoped the
revolution would come to their own country.
   ``I hope the government will be good enough to understand the
situation and open the society,'' said Nguyen Cao Son. ``We don't
want a situation like that in Romania to happen in Vietnam.''
   Nicolae Ceausescu, the Communist dictator of Romania, was
overthrown and executed last month after a bloody uprising.
   Hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese have been resettled in the
United States since the war.
   The two nations do not have diplomatic relations and political
problems hindered progress on emigration of the former inmates, but
major progress on humanitarian issues has been made in recent years.

   CBS has canceled its low-rated ``Beauty and
the Beast,'' with the show's last broadcast set for Jan. 24, the
network announced Friday.
   Craig Hoffman, a spokesman for the network, said the
action-comedy series ``Grand Slam'' will replace ``Beauty and the
Beast.''
   ``Beauty and the Beast,'' a combination crime-fighting romance
series set in the underground chambers of New York City, first came
to the network in the 1987-88 television season.
   The show originally starred Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton.
   ``Beauty and the Beast'' was not on CBS' fall schedule this
year, but made periodic appearances as a mid-season replacement.
The character played by Ms. Hamilton was killed off earlier this
season.

   The man identified by U.S. officials as a top
aide to deposed Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, appeared on
Israeli television Friday night to deny he had served as security
adviser to the dictator.
   Mike Harari, a former Israeli spymaster, also denied he had been
detained by U.S. troops in Panama during the American invasion.
   Some U.S. officials reported Dec. 28 that Harari had been
arrested in Panama by American troops, and a U.S. diplomat in
Panama described Harari as a close adviser to Noriega and an
instructor to Panama's defense forces, which Noriega headed.
   The reports of Harari's arrest later proved to be incorrect.
   ``As you can see, I'm here. I did not arrive (disguised) as a
blonde girl and did not come in a suitcase. My name is Mike Harari,
Michael Harari,'' he said in a taped interview recorded in an
Israel Television studio and broadcast Friday night.
   The television did not say when the interview was filmed, but it
first reported that Harari was in the country on Dec. 30. It was an
extremely rare appearance by Harari and the first since the Dec. 20
invasion of Panama by U.S. troops.
   ``I was not hiding and was not imprisoned by the Americans on
any occasion. I was in Panama when the war started and I avoided it
without any help, by my own means ... and, as you can see, I'm
here, in my country, at home, among my family and friends,'' Harari
said.
   He spoke of Israeli media reports that said the Israeli embassy
in Panama helped arrange his escape:
   ``Even before I came to Israel, on the way, I saw all the system
of disinformation about me: that I was detained, that there were
talks about me, that I was being transferred and released,'' Harari
said.
   Besides U.S. officials, foreign and Israeli media reports have
widely identified Harari as Noriega's personal security chief.
Israeli reports said he had considerable influence in Panama and
was once appointed by Noriega as Panama's honorary consul in Israel.
   But Harari insisted this was ``only disinformation that proves
what has happened in the last three years.
   ``What haven't they said about me? ... In which way haven't they
smeared me? They said I was Noriega's adviser.''
   ``I want to tell you: I'm not Noriega's adviser and have not
been in the past. I'm not No. 1 or No. 2. Noriega is not my
partner. I have not been in charge of his business affairs, I have
not been in charge or instructed his forces, I have not organized
his personal security. I'm just a private man who deals in trade,''
Harari stated.
   Harari's exploits have been widely described in newspapers and
books.
   According to the daily Yediot Ahronot, Harari, 62, was chief of
operations at Israel's Mossad secret agency when he headed the unit
trying to kill the leader of the Palestinian Black September group
that massacred 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.
   The case is also described in the book ``The Quest for the Red
Prince'' by Israeli authors Michael Bar-Zohar and Eitan Haber. In
the book, the team leader is referred to as ``Mike.''
   According to the accounts, the Israeli squad traced a man they
believed was Ali Hassan Salameh, alias the Red Prince, to the
resort of Lillehammer, Norway. The suspect was killed May 23, 1973,
but turned out to be a Moroccan-born waiter living in Lillehammer
with his Norwegian wife.
   Six of the Israeli agents involved in the mission were arrested
by Norwegian police to further Mossad embarrassment. Salameh was
killed in a Beirut car bomb blast on Jan. 22, 1979, believed to be
organized by Israeli agents.
   According to Israeli newspaper reports, Harari helped Noriega
recruit Israeli mercenaries as his personal bodyguards the last
year.

<HEAD>European Finance Chiefs Readjust Value of Italian Lira</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finance chiefs late Friday lowered the
value of the Italian lira in the European Monetary System but left
untouched the currencies of other nations in the exchange
arrangement.
   It was the first realignment of any currency in the system in
nearly three years.
   Analysts had widely predicted the finance officials would bump
up the value of the German mark, which has been gaining increasing
strength in recent weeks against other European currencies and the
U.S. dollar.
   The move to readjust the lira was unlikely to have any effect on
the dollar.
   In a statement, the European Community announced the Italian
government agreed to narrow the band in which the lira is allowed
to fluctuate in the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System.
   The arrangement seeks to prevent wide fluctuations in exchange
rates. The currencies of nine of the 12 nations of the European
Community trading bloc are linked in the exchange rate mechanism.
Only the currencies of Britain, Portugal and Greece remain outside.
   The Italian government decided to reduce the lira's range from 6
percent to 2.25 percent, which means the currency will be able to
move up or down by that much from a central rate. All the other
currencies except the Spanish peseta have a 2.25 percent band. The
peseta trades in the 6 percent range.
   Once the Italian authorities agreed on the narrower band, the
other finance officials set the new central rate for the lira at
1,529.7 to the European currency unit, an accounting unit created
by the community. The lira's midpoint had been 1,483.58.
   The new rates will begin Monday.
   Because the United States is not part of the European Monetary
System, or EMS, the dollar's value is not directly affected by the
shift.
   A senior European monetary official, who demanded anonymity,
predicted the currency shift would be remembered as ``one of the
smoothest'' in the history of the 10-year-old monetary system.
   He said telephone discussions among the finance officials began
Friday afternoon and ended nine hours later.
   The finance officials also welcomed the change as a sign
community nations were getting ready for the first phase of their
campaign for an economic and monetary union. The initial phase,
which will go into effect on July 1, calls for closer cooperation
on economic and monetary policies.
   They urged Italy to work harder to pare its federal budget
deficit. ``This will also foster greater economic convergence in
the community,'' they said.
   As word spread that the monetary officials were working on a
realignment, analysts expected they would rejigger the value of
most of the currencies, lowering many of them but lifting the
German mark.
   German authorities have been pressing for a realignment to
bolster their currency's value but French officials have opposed
any move to clip the franc.
   The value of the mark has soared with the opening of borders
between East and West Germany and the economic reforms in other
Eastern European countries. Expectations are high that Germany will
take advantage of the openings in the East and strengthen its
already powerful economy.
   Before the community's announcement, Earl Johnson, a vice
president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, said a
change in only the lira would increase pressure to realign the
other currencies.
   Zlatko Glamuzina, chief dealer at Banco di Sicilia in New York,
said the EMS needed ``fine-tuning'' from time to time.

   Three juveniles and one adult will be
charged in connection with an alleged rape at the South Dakota
governor's mansion, a prosecutor said.
   Gov. George Mickelson and his wife, Linda, were out of town on
the date of the alleged rape on Nov. 28. The whereabouts of their
17-year-oldson David, who also lives at the mansion, have not been
disclosed.
   A source close to the investigation has said a small group of
high school students, including David Mickelson, had a drinking
party at the governor's mansion on the night of the incident.
   Yankton County State's Attorney Craig Kennedy, hired as special
prosecutor in the case, would not say Thursday what charges will be
brought against the juveniles. State law makes all juvenile court
matters confidential, he said.
   The adult, who must be at least 18, will be charged with
underage consumption of alcohol, Kennedy said. ``I expect that
would happen the first part of next week,'' he said. The legal
drinking age in South Dakota is 21.
   Police received a report Nov. 30 saying four boys at the
governor's home in Pierre raped a girl who was later identified as
a 16-year-old Fort Pierre high school student.
   The governor has said the charges are unfounded, but he has
refused to make any detailed public comment about the incident.
   Kennedy said he has had no contact with the governor about the
investigation. ``I've never talked to the governor about this,''
Kennedy said. ``He's never tried to contact me about it.''

   A paroled killer charged in the slayings
of eight women was ordered held without bail Friday and authorities
say they have linked the man to a total of 11 killings over the
last two years.
   The break in the serial slayings was ``just a matter of luck,''
said one of the police officers who spotted the suspect's car from
a helicopter.
   After his arrest, Arthur Shawcross, 44, of Rochester made
statements about the slayings and told police where to find three
bodies, said Police Chief Gordon F. Urlacher, who refused to say if
the suspect confessed.
   A state police source, who spoke on condition on anonymity, said
Shawcross had confessed to 11 slayings.
   Authorities had been investigating the deaths and disappearances
of 16 women in the Rochester area since March 1988 and as recently
as Dec. 26. Urlacher and Monroe County District Attorney Howard R.
Relin said five of the slayings are not related to the others.
   ``The number that we believe that he's responsible for was 11,''
Urlacher said. ``We've said all along that we don't believe all
these cases were related, and that's the way it turned out.''
   Most of the women Shawcross is accused of killing were involved
in prostitution and drugs, police said.
   ``He went to them posing as a `john' (customer), was able to get
them in the car, then took control of them _ took them to various
locations, wherever it might have been,'' State Police
Superintendent Thomas Constantine said in Albany. ``In most cases,
the death was strangulation.''
   Constantine also said some victims were mutilated.
   Shawcross pleaded innocent to eight counts of second-degree
murder in Rochester City Court on Friday. Judge John Manning Regan
ordered him held without bail. A preliminary hearing was scheduled
for Wednesday.
   Shawcross was also charged with one count of patronizing a
prostitute.
   In addition to the eight cases in which charges were filed, the
district attorney said evidence linking Shawcross to three other
deaths will be presented to grand juries in Monroe and neighboring
Wayne counties.
   Relin said Shawcross moved to Rochester in 1987, when he was
paroled from prison. He had serving 15 years for the 1972
strangling of 8-year-old Karen Ann Hill of Rochester while she was
visiting Watertown, 150 miles to the northeast.
   Police said the break in the serial slayings came Wednesday
while officers in a helicopter were searching a park 12 miles east
of Rochester where clothing of a missing woman had been found. The
officers spotted Shawcross' car, then the body of another missing
woman.
   ``It was kind of like (we saw) the vehicle first, and then the
second time around we both saw the body,'' said state police Sgt.
Ken R. Hundt, a helicopter pilot. ``As far as I'm concerned, it was
just a matter of luck.''
   ``The two pilots and the investigator may have been flying that
plane, but the hand of God was also at the controls,'' said Deputy
Rochester Police Chief Terrence Rickard.
   Police on the ground followed Shawcross to a nursing home. He
was questioned there Wednesday and taken into custody Thursday,
said state police Maj. Salvatore F. Valvo. Police refused to say
why Shawcross was at the home.
   ``The person derives some type of satisfaction from the murder
and it's very possible that they go back and look at the results,''
Constantine said.
   Two of the bodies whose location Shawcross revealed were found
Thursday night and the third was found Friday as Shawcross was
being arraigned. The third was that of a 22-year-old missing since
Nov. 6.
   Police refused to comment on an motive for the slayings.
   ``It's very difficult to get inside the head of a person like
this,'' Urlacher said.
   Shawcross had appeared to be adapting well to life outside
prison, said Edward Elwin, executive director of the state Division
of Parole. Shawcross worked as as a salad-maker at a restaurant,
Elwin said.
   ``Superficially, he was making a good adjustment,'' Elwin said.
   Shawcross had tried to settle elsewhere in New York state but
was moved by parole officials from both places because of
complaints of local residents.
   According to state records, Shawcross, a Watertown native, was
imprisoned from 1969 to 1971 for a burglary conviction, and was
married three times. He earned a high school equivalency degree
while serving time on the manslaughter conviction, prison records
showed.
   Shawcross was charged in the slayings of: Darlene Trippi, 32;
Felicia Stephens, 20; June Stotts, 29; Frances Brown, 22; Patricia
Ives, 25; Anne Marie Steffen, 27; Dorothy Blackburn, 27; and
Dorothy Keller.
   Clem Brown of Rochester, grandfather of Frances Brown, said
Shawcross should be put to death for the slayings.
   ``What the hell did they let him out for if he does that?''
Brown told the Syracuse Herald-Journal. ``If he killed kids, he
sure as hell would do it to someone else.''

   President Bush on Friday released $184.6
million in disaster aid to help with recovery from the California
earthquake in October and Hurricane Hugo in September.
   The White House said in a statement the money would be used for
school reconstruction, debris removal, transfer of patients to
Veterans Administration hospitals from damaged facilities and
repairing federal parks, forests, wildlife refuges and medical
facilities.
   It also will be used for forest fire prevention and
stabilization of historic properties.
   The Education Department will distribute $62.8 million for
school reconstruction and related costs in the Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, South Carolina and North Carolina, the White House
said.
   It said the Veterans Affairs Department will distribute $56.8
million for construction and repair of its facilities as well as
transfer of patients.
   The money comes from a congressionally approved package that
Bush signed Oct. 26, allocating a total of $2.85 billion in
disaster relief for regions that suffered from Hurricane Hugo and
the Northern California quake.
   Of that money, Bush was left $250 million to spend as he saw fit
on unanticipated needs from both disasters.
   He already has disbursed $20 million for earthquake preparedness
planning by the Federal Emergency Managment Administration and
other agencies.
   After distribution of the funds announced Friday, Bush will have
$45.5 million left in the fund for unanticipated needs.

<HEAD>Commission Says Oil-Transport System Needs Overhaul to Prevent
Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state commission on the Exxon Valdez oil
spill called Friday for an overhaul of the nation's
oil-transportation system, and blamed the disaster partly on the
Coast Guard's ``unduly friendly relationship with industry.''
   The commission's report also blames the nation's worst oil spill
on a reckless rush to profits by the oil industry, and criticizes
government agencies and the public for not insisting on stringent
environmental safeguards.
   Better monitoring of tanker traffic, increased use of
double-hull tankers, larger tanker crews and a stronger commitment
by industry and government to environmental protection are among
the report's recommendations.
   ``Obviously, the present system _ providing minimum penalites
for creating massive environmental damage _ has not deterred the
industry from putting the coasts and oceans of the world at
constant hazard,'' it says.
   The preliminary report by the Alaska Oil Spill Commission makes
59 recommendations that the state and federal governments and oil
industry can adopt to prevent oil spills and improve their spill
response.
   The report is especially critical of the Coast Guard for its
``confusion of mission and an unduly friendly relationship with
industry.''
   ``The Coast Guard has failed the American people in providing
oversight of the country's oil-transportation system,'' the report
says. ``Enforcement must be strengthened and the penalty structure
raised.''
   The report blames the Coast Guard's lax safety enforcement and
reduced state oversight on ``the national mood under President
Reagan'' toward less government regulation.
   ``Safety does not do well in a laissez-faire environment,'' it
says.
   Lt. Ray Massey, a Coast Guard spokesman in Juneau, said the
agency had not received a copy of the report and would have no
comment. Les Rogers, a spokesman for Exxon Co. USA in Houston also
declined to comment.
   The Alaska Legislature formed the investigatory commission in
the weeks after the Exxon Valdez spill last spring, in which nearly
11 million gallons of Alaska crude gushed into Prince William
Sound. Its seven members were appointed by Gov. Steve Cowper.
   ``This disaster could have been prevented, not by tanker
captains and crews who are only fallible human beings, but by an
advanced oil-transportation system designed to minimize human
error,'' commission chairman Walt Parker said in the report's
foreward.
   The captain of the tanker, Joseph Hazelwood, was fired amid
charges he had been drunk at the time of the accident. His trial is
scheduled to begin Jan. 22.
   Parker was on a task force that helped set tanker standards for
the Port Valdez trade in the late 1970s. He said that when tankers
began moving oil from the trans-Alaska pipeline at Valdez in 1977,
a good system to prevent spills was in place. But the system fell
apart because of legal action by the oil industry that pre-empted
the state from enforcing many of its rules.
   ``The shippers simply stopped following the rules, and the Coast
Guard stopped enforcing them,'' Parker said.
   Tankers originally were to remain inside tanker lanes at all
times in the sound, and slow down to minimum speed when ice was
present, he said. The Exxon Valdez was allowed to go outside the
lanes at full speed when it neared ice, which led to it running
aground on Bligh Reef.
   ``The original rules were consistently violated, primarily to
ensure that tankers passing through Prince William Sound did not
lose time by slowing down for ice or waiting for winds to to
abate,'' the report says. ``Concern for profits in the 1980s
obliterated the concern for safe operations that existed in 1977.''
   The report also cites the state Legislature's failure to provide
enough money for the Department of Environmental Conservation,
which is responsible for spill prevention and cleanup plans.
   ``The department's small staff was overwhelmed by technical
licensing and permitting activities, leaving no opportunity for the
agency to perform its role as overall environmental policy
watchdog,'' it says.
   Cowper described the report as ``a cold and sober assessment of
what happened'' in the Exxon Valdez disaster.
   ``A key event here was the striking down of Alaska's laws that
would have controlled tanker movements and the degree of
preparation for oil spills,'' Cowper said at a news conference.
``The commission came to the conclusion that our oil-spill response
capability is still primitive.''
   Cowper and state House Speaker Sam Cotten said legislation to
adopt some of the report's recommendations may be considered during
the 1990 legislative session, which begins Monday.
   ``It's a little bit too early to specifically respond to the
spill report's findings right now. But I think we will probably do
whatever is recommended here,'' Cowper said.
   Cotten said he was unsure if the Legislature has the will to get
any new spill laws passed this session. Some legislators have said
they first want to take a second look at the package of ``spill
bills'' they quickly passed last spring after the Exxon Valdez
spill.
   Among the report's other recommendations:
   _The party responsible for the spill not be in charge of the
cleanup. ``A spiller should be obligated to respond with the
resources it can summon, but government should command the
response,'' the report says.
   _A formal command system with a predesignated coordinator be
established to handle the cleanup. A lesson from the Exxon Valdez
spill is that such a system is needed to avoid confusion and
disagreements between the agencies and companies involved, the
report says.
   _Congress either strengthen the Coast Guard's ability to respond
to spills or transfer its cleanup duties to the Army Corps of
Engineers. The report says Congress also needs to provide more
money for the Environmental Protection Agency for spill prevention
and response.

   Sales of prerecorded videocassettes in 1989
soared 40 percent from a year ago, as ``Batman'' helped spark $7.1
billion in video sales and rentals.
   While 1989 box-office revenues also set a record in excess of $5
billion, video shoppers spent $2.2 billion on videocassette
purchases, according to Paul Kagan Associates.
   ``Batman,'' the top film at the nation's theaters, was estimated
to have sold 11 million cassettes. ``Bambi'' sold 10.5 million
cassettes and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' sold 8.2 million copies.
   Retail sales surged to 138 million units, up from 95 million
units in 1988, Kagan reported.
   According to a study by the research firm Alexander &amp;
Associates, sales were up 24 percent in the September to
mid-December period to $620 million, compared to $470 million from
the same period a year ago.
   The sales figures reflected the increased presence of mass
merchandisers like K mart and Target in the video business.
Alexander &amp; Associates said video stores accounted for only 16
percent of holiday video sales while mass merchants did 37 percent
of the volume.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lawsuit over Ringo Starr's attempt to block
the release of a record album ended Friday when a judge ordered the
former Beatle to pay more than $74,000 to the record's producer.
   Superior Court Judge Clarence Cooper, who issued a permanent
injunction in November preventing produer Chips Moman's company
from releasing the 1987 album, ruled that Starr must pay Moman
$74,354 to cover costs of the recording sessions, and 7 percent
interest.
   Starr contended he was under the influence of alcohol at the
time the album was recorded and said he was not satisfied with the
results after returning home to England and listening to the tapes.
   He sued Moman and his CRS Records of College Park, Ga., to block
the album's release.
   The album included some new songs along with some older songs,
such as ``I Can Help'' and ``Ain't That a Shame.'' At the non-jury
trial in November, Moman testified that Bob Dylan made a guest
appearance on one song.
   An attorney for Starr, Robert Fleming Jr., said Friday he had
not seen the ruling but indicated he was satisfied with it as he
understood it.
   ``This amount is right in line with what the expenses were and
what we were ready to pay,'' he said. ``The judge must have agreed
that the agreement was what we said it was and enforced it
accordingly.''
   Moman had contended that Starr owed him $146,239.
   Moman's attorney did not immediately return a telephone call.
   Starr testified in November that he went to Memphis, Tenn., to
work with Moman in February 1987 after a brief meeting with the
producer the previous year. Attorneys for Moman said Starr came to
the producer in an attempt to revive his career.
   Starr, who had a successful U.S. tour last year, testified he
was not desperate when he talked to Moman.
   ``It was just a move for your career,'' he said. He said his
business agent had told him that he and Moman ``would be a winning
combination.''

   Zoo officials celebrated on Friday the birth of
a baby black rhinoceros, boosting the captive population of the
endangered species.
   ``It's a female weighing 66 pounds,'' said Zoo Director Charles
Hoessle. ``We're always very cautious for the first 24 hours with
any newborn animal, but she seems strong and normal.''
   Hoessle said the baby is the result of a reeding program in
cooperation with other zoos in North America.
   ``The mother, Betsy, belongs to the Detroit Zoo,'' Hoessle said.
``The father, Toto, is ours. All the zoos manage the North American
black rhino population as one population, moving the animals around
to avoid inbreeding.''
   Hoessle said there are 70 or 75 black rhinos in captivity in
this country, more than half of them born in zoos.
   ``In contrast,'' Hoessle said, ``in the wild the population of
the animals has crashed from more than 100,000 to less than 3,500
in a little over 10 years. Drastic efforts are being made to save
the few that are left by putting them in heavily protected parks.''
   Hoessle said poachers were rapidly destroying the animals in the
wild, killing the large beasts just for their horns.
   ``The horns are really nothing more than tightly compacted
hair,'' Hoessle said. ``They are used for dagger handles in Yemen
and for folk medicines and sex potionts in the Orient. There's no
real medicinal value in them, of course.''
   Hoessle said no photographs of the newborn rhino were
immediately available. ``The mother is very aggressive,'' he said,
``and we have to be cautious. We plan to try to sneak in our staff
photographer as soon as we think it's safe.''

<TEXT>
   The non-Communist government on Friday
acknowledged widespread shortages after a radical economic plan
took effect, but it urged patience to allow for the transformation
of Poland's economy to capitalism.
   ``The first few days are behind us so there is a lot of
confusion, anxiety and panic, understandable in a situation of deep
and radical changes which also are being introduced quickly,'' said
government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska.
   Shoppers wiped out supplies of flour, sugar, and meat in many
stores after the announcement of sharp increases for many goods and
services Monday and Tuesday.
   ``We have to give time so the medicine can work. We have to show
patience and calm so the new economic mechanisms can start
working,'' she said.
   Deputy Finance Minister Marek Dabrowski said problems in food
deliveries led to shortages, especially for meat and butter, and
that some enterprises were having trouble paying their bills.
   The Solidarity-led government was encouraged by the
stabilization of the zloty following a 32 percent devaluation on
Monday, an increase in bank deposits and an improvement in export
figures in December, Dabrowski said.
   One of the central elements of the plan, which aims to halt
Poland's 900 percent annual inflation and transform an economy
directly managed by Communists for four decades, is to make the
zloty a convertible currency.
   Poland until now has had two rates of exchange _ an official
rate set by the government and a higher black market rate.
   This week, for the first time in memory, the average official
rate of 9,500 zlotys to the dollar was higher than the unofficial
rate.
   The government hopes that a convertible currency will help
attract foreign investors who until now have hesitated to develop
projects in Poland without a guarantee of being able to expatriate
their profits.
   But Dabrowski said individual consumers have suffered, partially
because producers have withheld reverves of meat from the market
while they waited to see if the new plan would work.
   ``We found ourselves in a new reality, a shock took place after
the prices of energy and fuels went up,'' he said.
   Also Friday, the government announced the reversal of a decision
by previous Communist authorities to close the Lenin Shipyard in
Gdansk, where the Solidarity trade union was born in 1980.
   Niezabitowska told a news conference that the Ministry of
Finance, the Ministry of Industry and the shipyard had decided to
tranform the firm into a joint stock company during talks Wednesday.
   The former Communist-led government announced the decision to
close the historic shipyard on Oct. 31, 1988.
   The move was immediately denounced by Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa _ an electrician at the plant _ as a ``provocation.'' Walesa
vowed to fight to save the shipyard and began a search for
potential investors.
   Barbara-Piasecka Johnson, a Polish-American businesswoman and
heir of the Johnson &amp; Johnson pharmaceutical fortune, in June said
she would spent up to $100 million on the plant if she received
ownership of 55 percent of the stock. But her letter of intent
expired Monday.
   It was unclear whether she would make another offer for plant.
   In Washington, Bazyli Samojlik, economic counselor at the Polish
Embassy, said Friday night Mrs. Johnson's agreement was ``a
business agreement so the government is not involved in it.'' Asked
about the Dec. 31. limit for completing discussions, he said,
``It's not a deadline as I understand it.''
   John Peach, an adviser to Mrs. Johnson at her estate in
Princeton, N.J., was on vacation and could not be reached for
comment, according to a woman who answered the telephone at Peach's
office.
   ``My understanding is that negotiations will continue,'' the
woman said, refusing to identify herself or her function.
   Niezabitowska said shipyard workers will be able to purchase
shares on a preferential basis and other shares will be made
available to foreign investors.

   A total of 217 feature-length films are
eligible for 1989 Academy Award consideration, down almost 20
percent from the 270 titles eligible last year, the Academy
announced Friday.
   The list of qualified films will be sent to 4,750 Academy

<TEXT>
   The papal nuncio, Monsignor Jose
Sebastian Laboa, denied Friday that he gave Gen. Manuel Noriega an
ultimatum to leave the Vatican mission where the Panamanian leader
had been in refuge for 10 days.
   ``He left of his own accord. The nuncio never told him to
leave,'' Laboa told The Associated Press by in a telephone
interview. ``There was no threat. There is not a single basis for
thinking that.''
   He said letters Noriega wrote to Pope John Paul II, the nuncio
and others before he left Wednesday night and was taken by U.S.
authorities to Miami to face drug trafficking charges indicated
``he left of his own free will.''
   ``In the letters that he wrote he said that they advised him
that this was the best,'' Laboa said.
   Among those in the nunciature with Noriega were his personal
security chief, Capt. Eliecer Gaitan, and Lt. Col. Nivaldo
Madrinan, a top Noriega adviser and head of his secret police.
   Madrinan surrendered to U.S. troops on Thursday. Gaitan is
seeking asylum in Spain, Laboa said.
   Thursday night, the Rev. Javier Villanueva, who was assisting
Laboa during Noriega's stay, said, ``If he would not have given
himself up, the Panamanian government, not the U.S. government,
would have been invited to send in forces to take him out. We would
have lifted the diplomatic immunity.''
   Asked about the statement, Laboa said, ``I don't know how such
craziness could have come out.''
   Villanueva was not reachable at the nunciature or at his parish
Friday night. He heads Christ the King Church, whose members
include top officials of the new government of Guillermo Endara and
their supporters.
   During the months of protests last year to demand Noriega's
ouster, the congregation often waved white handkerchiefs, a protest
symbol, during Mass, and held demonstrations outside the church
afterwards.

<HEAD>Disney World Reaches Settlement in Vulture Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walt Disney World has pleaded guilty to one
federal misdemeanor charge for its handling of vultures that
invaded the Discovery Island theme park.
   As part of a settlement announced Friday, Disney agreed to pay a
federal fine of $10,000 and contribute another $10,000 to the
Florida Audubon Society.
   Disney also agreed to contribute $75,000 to the State Game and
Fresh Water Fish Commission's conservation program.
   In exchange, the state agreed to defer 13 misdemeanor charges
filed against Discovery Island and five employees for abusing the
vultures and other wild birds. The state will drop all charges if
the company and the employees adhere to all environmental and
wildlife laws for the next year.
   Disney pleaded guilty to one federal count of moving 149
vultures to another area when it only had a permit to move 100
birds. Two other federal charges were dropped.
   Disney accepted the settlement because of the legal expenses
necessary to fight the case, spokesman Charlie Ridgeway said.
   Charges were filed in September after the deaths of vultures and
the alleged mistreatment of other birds at Discovery Island, an
11-acre zoological site.
   Disney said the wild birds were attacking animals, stealing
their food, defecating on park boardwalks and making too much noise.
   Among the state and federal charges filed against Disney and the
five employees were allegations that workers beat vultures to
death; held dozens of them in a small, overheated shed with little
food and water; shot hawks and falcons; and knocked eggs from the
nests of egrets and ibises.
   ``The employees involved will be reassigned to jobs not relating
to wildlife or Discovery Island,'' Ridgeway said. ``We expect to
make improvements to the island and the park worthy of the public's
and authorities' approval.''

<TEXT>
   Louisiana's tropical Brown Pelican
population was barely on the mend when it was ravaged by a record
freeze that turned the marsh into a moss-draped icicle, the state's
wildlife chief said Friday.
   Temperatures dropped to single digits the week before Christmas
and the effect is just being felt in the wetlands.
   ``We know we've lost 50 birds and it may be in the hundreds
before it's all over,'' said Wildlife and Fisheries Secretary
Virginia Van Sickle. ``Even 50 is a major loss when you think in
terms of a population of just 2,000.''
   Preliminary findings don't show any major damage to other
wildlife and fish with the exception of nutria, or water-dwelling
rats, said Van Sickle.
   Louisiana is wealthy in oysters, shrimp, alligators and nutria
but the symbol of the state _ the Brown Pelican _ had disappeared
by 1970, another victim of the pesticide DDT.
   More than 600 Brown Pelicans were imported from Florida 10 years
ago in a restocking program that has been closely followed.
   ``One of the 50 birds we've found so far was a banded bird, one
of the original pelicans brought from Florida,'' Van Sickle said.
``They appeared to have been killed by exposure or injuries caused
when they dived into ice. Some had broken legs, wings and had died
of starvation. Injured, they were just too weak to find food.''
   A few injured birds were found and taken to Audubon Park Zoo in
New Orleans for treatment, she said.

   The Bush administration, after months of
condemning Panama's Manuel Antonio Noriega as a ``thug'' and a
criminal, is toning down its rhetoric to avoid prejudicing the
deposed dictator's drug-trafficking trial.
   An administration official disclosed Thursday that Noriega
surrendered to the U.S. military in Panama City only after the
Vatican Embassy gave him a deadline to leave.
   As defense officials were replacing U.S. combat troops in Panama
with rebuilding forces, a senior official said Noriega's longtime
CIA ties have been reviewed and that any potentially damaging
disclosures Noriega might use in his trial defense will be
``manageable.''
   President Bush kept a low profile on the day after he announced
Noriega's Wednesday night surrender to U.S. forces in Panama. Only
days earlier, he had called Noriega a ``thug.''

   With potential new democracies springing up in
Panama and Eastern Europe, there is a growing demand for the United
States to get out its foreign aid checkbook at a time when the
world's leading democracy can ill afford it.
   ``We have a hell of a problem, and it's getting tighter and
tighter and tighter,'' said Mark Edelman, the acting director of
the State Department's Agency for International Development.
   The Bush administration this week sent a delegation to Panama to
evaluate the need for U.S. assistance in reviving a formerly robust
economy crippled by American trade sanctions. Early estimates of
needed aid are running upwards of $1 billion over the next few
years.
   The president also has pledged that Eastern European countries
that adopt democracy and reform their economies can expect help of
the sort that Congress voted last year for Poland and Hungary,
which are getting $840 million over the next three years.

   Romania's provisional government is
developing closer ties with Moscow than the communist regime it
replaced, welcoming Soviet offers of aid and expecting a productive
visit by a top Soviet official.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze is to arrive in
Bucharest on Saturday for the first consultations between the new
government and the Kremlin since dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was
toppled Dec. 22 and executed with his wife Elena on Christmas Day.
   Silviu Brucan, a top foreign policy official, said Thursday the
new leadership had assurances from the Kremlin that Romania will
get extensive assistance, including plentiful energy supplies for
the harsh winter.
   Unlike other East European revolutions, which have pulled former
satellite nations further from Moscow, Romania's uprising appears
to have strengthened what had been deteriorating relations between
Moscow and Bucharest.

   Overweight people fighting the battle of the
bulge can diet themselves to death in improperly supervised
very-low-calorie programs that are used by more than a million
Americans, doctors warned today.
   Such liquid diets require management by a specially trained
physician, and by a behavioral psychologist and dietician, the
doctors wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Although the diets are ``unquestionably safer'' than their
liquid-protein predecessors, which were blamed for at least 58
deaths during the 1970s, they still have dangers, said the
article's authors.
   ``The recent and zealous marketing of various formula products
to physicians, as well as the public's appetite for such diets,
could lead to yet another round of complications and fatalities,''
wrote the doctors, who are from the University of Pennsylvania,
Columbia University and Harvard Medical School.

<HEAD>Chinese Students Turn in Required Self-Criticism Reports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After it crushed the democracy movement last
spring, the Chinese government ordered university students to write
self-criticism reports on their involvement. They have now turned
them in _ more as grudgingly done homework than soul-searching
reflections.
   Students say they passed around a few ``master'' reports before
the December deadline, or plagiarized government propaganda to
satisfy authorities overseeing the political education exercise.
   ``My report was nonsense. I just said silly things, all lies,''
said a student at Beijing University, which was at the forefront of
the movement. ``I said I didn't agree with the hunger strike and
posters, and that I didn't participate in anything.''
   In fact the student took part in the hunger strike and
occupation of Tiananmen Square, printed and handed out leaflets,
and broadcast pro-movement messages over school loudspeakers.
   Yet the student's report echoed with numbing mimicry the
government line drummed into the populace since the June 3-4
crackdown that left hundreds if not thousands dead.
   ``Soldiers rushed in to Beijing to enforce martial law as the
city suffered a serious counterrebellion,'' the student's 11-page
report said.
   ``The soldiers, who were brothers and sons of the people, gave
their blood to save the country and protect the people's peace. The
masterminds of the turmoil used every means possible to achieve
their despicable political aims, manipulating the hunger-striking
students, treating students' lives like betting chips, disrupting
the martial law order and uniting social forces to beat, smash,
steal, burn and kill, and try to use violence to overthrow our
legitimate government.''
   Such parroting of the official line was reflected in other
students' similarly written reports, which were reprinted for
several weeks in Beijing's two local newspapers, the Communist
Party's Beijing Daily and the tabloid Beijing Evening News.
   The written testimonies have been the price the government has
asked for not punishing the tens of thousands of students who took
part in the spring demonstrations. Dozens of student leaders have
been arrested and face long years in prison.
   Students say the key was to write the proper view about the
movement, and how their attitudes have changed since June, or the
reports will be returned for rewriting.
   ``Mainly they wanted to know precisely what we did. We just said
we were used by a small handful of people because we were too
young, too childish,'' said one student who took a report that had
been submitted to her father, a teacher, and shared it with several
classmates.
   ``We didn't copy it completely, just changed things around,''
she said. ``Some of us turned them in to the same teachers, so we
had to be careful.''
   Ideological education is being stressed at Beijing University,
more than any other school. Its entire freshman class is spending a
year at an army academy for political study and military training.
   ``A lot of people didn't want to waste time writing these
things,'' the Beijing University student said. ``It was pretty easy
to find the proper things to say. We have so many references _ news
reports, books _ to copy from. Some of my friends copied whole
paragraphs from newspapers.''
   At one of Beijing's technical universities, numerous master
copies of essays were floating around.
   ``We had to change details of the reports to match ourselves, so
people couldn't tell they were from the same model,'' a management
student at the university said.
   The student wrote a report by copying from newspapers, and a
roommate copied that report in turn.
   ``I think the reports should be written,'' a student at Beijing
Normal University, another activist hotbed, said resignedly.
   ``It keeps things quiet and then people won't bother you.''
   He did note he did not take part in any marches or rallies.
   ``Nothing's going to change anyway,'' he added. ``We'll still
have the same leaders and the same society.''
   Students were not the only ones required to produce reports.
Professors and some party members, intellectuals and workers were
also obliged.
   ``I only wrote three pages,'' said a worker in the publishing
business. ``I said _ truthfully _ that I kept on working throughout
the turmoil and had no part of it.''
   The worker added, however, that none of his colleagues wrote
reports sympathetic to the protesters.
   ``These are all given to our superiors, you know,'' he said.
   A professor at a prestigious professional university in Beijing
who had to give his report on the turmoil orally to colleagues says
students were wrong to neglect their studies.
   ``I gave a little speech and said the problem is with
education,'' he recalled.
   ``I said young people aren't interested in studying these days.
My school is the best in its field, but so many students at my
school are from the `T-faction' _ all they think about is taking
the TOEFL exam.''
   The TOEFL, or Test of English as a Foreign Language, is required
by all schools in the United States of foreign students.
   Supervision of the students' essays was not uniformly rigorous.
   ``Of course, our leaders know a lot of us aren't serious,'' the
management major said.
   Writing the essays was nevertheless a necessary exercise for
staying on track for this student, who took part in many of the
activities around Tiananmen Square but still plans to join the
Communist Party.
   ``If I want to go abroad, I'd better join,'' the student said.
``It will be very useful for my future, for me to get a good job.''

   Israeli soldiers have
been seen in disguise _ civilian clothes, masks or even traditional
embroidered dresses of Arab women _ in their effort to capture
leaders of the Palestinian uprising.
   The tactic, along with the commandeering of cars with West Bank
or Gaza Strip license plates, is designed to fool lookouts who
often guard entrances to Palestinian villages and camps.
   In November, two 20-year-old men who had been shot came to a
hospital in the West Bank town of Jenin and told doctors they were
in a car fired on by Jewish settlers or other Israelis in civilian
clothes.
   The Israeli army later confirmed two men were shot near Jenin
but said it was soldiers who opened fire when the car's driver
ignored orders to stop. A spokesman refused comment when asked if
the soldiers were wearing civilian clothes.
   The pattern of disguise has been emerging over the past four or
five months. Arab reporters say eight people have been killed by
men in civilian cars or in disguise who shot at wanted
Palestinians, stone throwers or people painting anti-Israeli
graffiti.
   On Dec. 1, according to Arab witnesses, soldiers wearing Arab
robes and kaffiyeh scarves killed four members of a radical group
called the Black Panthers on a narrow street in Nablus, the West
Bank's largest town.
   In that case, officials insisted the troops were in uniform.
Generally the army has refused official comment on reports of
disguised soldiers.
   When asked about the disguises, an army spokesman, Col. Nachman
Shai, said the army ``does not reveal details of its operational
activities.''
   In Kafr Kaddum, residents told of Israelis in civilian clothes
arriving in the village in a minibus with blue West Bank license
plates Sept. 10, then opening fire and killing Zaher Obeid, 28, and
Fahed Ishtawi, 14.
   Obeid's brother Jawad, a retired school principal, said this is
what happened when the minibus entered the village:
   ``Some 100 people gathered around. ... A boy recognized a man
inside the car as an army officer who questioned him two days
before. Zaher shouted ... `These are spies.'''
   Half an hour later, Obeid was dead, reportedly chased and shot
by one of a dozen soldiers who stormed out of the vehicle, which
had cardboard-covered windows, firing pistols and M-16 assault
rifles. Six others were reported wounded in the army action.
   The army confirmed the raid on Kafr Kaddum, 31 miles north of
Jerusalem. It said soldiers opened fire after being attacked with
stones and metal bars. No references to disguises were made.
   Although the army does not officially acknowledge it uses
disguises, one military source, speaking anonymously, told The
Associated Press that security forces resort to disguise to capture
Palestinians wanted for attacks on fellow Arabs accused of
collaborating with Israel.
   At least 155 suspected collaborators have been slain in the
two-year uprising, and 626 other Palestinians have died from
Israeli gunfire. Forty-three Israelis have been killed.
   The Israeli newspaper Hadashot quoted a senior military source
as saying soldiers would keep using disguises ``until the wanted
men won't know where (the army) is coming from and will be afraid
of everybody and everything around them.''
   During the uprising, police have acknowledged they posed as
journalists, and Israeli newspapers have repeatedly reported
soldiers commandeering vehicles with license plates from the
occupied lands.
   In November, two Palestinians were sentenced to 25 months in
prison after documents were submitted to an Israeli military court
in the Gaza Strip saying they stoned a local civilian vehicle and
then were arrested by soldiers who got out of the car.
   In Gaza and the West Bank city of Nablus, Arab reporters say
soldiers have been seen with Arab kaffiyehs over their faces in
imitation of uprising activists or in women's scarves and
colorfully embroidered dresses.
   In an August incident, a crowd in Gaza's Shati refugee camp
chased away seven masked men painting anti-Israeli graffiti on
walls when onlookers became suspicious the artists actually were
soldiers, a Gazan source said.
   ``They painted a Palestinian flag with wrong colors,'' he added.
   In the West Bank city of Bethlehem, Mayor Elias Freij quoted
witnesses as saying security agents dressed up like tourists, with
backpacks and cameras, opened fire Aug. 19 on Arab demonstrators,
killing one.
   The army said the men were soldiers and again did not mention
disguises.

from Hong Kong who fear for their future after the British colony
reverts to China in seven years.
   They are in demand here because they are thought to be a natural
fit for Singapore's Chinese-dominated society, where language would
not be an insurmountable barrier.
   Many have come already to stay or to just to look around. Real
estate brokers say Hong Kong people like Singapore's lush greenery
and relative quiet, both are in short supply where they come from.
They also like the prices of condominiums and houses, usually far
cheaper than in Hong Kong.
   Some of the Hong Kong visitors are taken on carefully conducted
``emigration tours'' to meet government officials, bankers and
others who could be helpful if it becomes necessary to find homes
in a new land.
   Confidence in Hong Kong's future under Chinese control after
1997, after shrinking slowly since the joint declaration was signed
by China and Britain in 1984, dropped dramatically following the
violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's
Tiananman Square in June.
   Earlier attempts by Singapore to lure business people with the
equivalent of $510,000 in capital, college graduates and
professionals met with little success. Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew
said in 1987 that Singapore came ``a poor third'' after Canada and
Australia in enticing people from Hong Kong.
   That changed within weeks of the Tianaman Square bloodshed when
Lee's government relaxed the rules for as many as 25,000 skilled
workers and their families. The quota applies to those with a high
school education, five years of on-the-job experience and an income
of at least $770 a month.
   Some 10,000 hopefuls swarmed Singapore's Consulate in Hong Kong
within hours of the announcement. A key attraction is that
successful applicants can wait for as long as five years to take up
residence, and get an option to extend for another five, giving
them a chance to experience post-1997 Hong Kong before deciding.
Canada, Australia and other destinations require them to move in
promptly.
   But as nurses, teachers and others aggravated an already serious
brain drain by taking jobs in Singapore, newspapers and others in
Hong Kong hit at what they saw as opportunism on Singapore's part
in taking advantage of the colony's troubles.
   Hong Kong and Singapore, a city-state of 2.6 million people at
the tip of the Malay Peninsula, have long been rivals as hubs for
regional trade, finance and communications, although they are about
1,600 miles apart. Both are free-trade ports, have limited space
and no natural resources except strategic locations and the skill
of their peoples.
   George Yeo, Singapore's minister of state for foreign affairs,
denied that his government acted to make things more difficult for
Hong Kong or China. If those in Hong Kong intended to leave anyway,
he said, it would be better to keep them in the region so their
talent would not be lost to North America or Australia.
   One analyst said the wave of migration might allow Singapore to
reprise one reason for Hong Kong's economic boom. Thousands of
entrepreneurs left cosmopolitan Shanghai before it fell to the
Chinese communists 41 years ago to find refuge in Hong Kong, and
helped it prosper.
   Singapore expects a value-added to the economy per worker of
about $42,000 to $52,000 a year, said Mah Bow Tan, the minister of
state for trade and industry. Using the lower figure, Mah said
25,000 skilled migrants would add $1.05 billion, about 4 percent of
the country's gross domestic product.
   Not everyone awaits the newcomers with open arms, however.
   ``Our workers certainly do not want a flood of foreigners to
come here and steal their jobs,'' said Chaim See Tong,
secretary-general of the Singapore Democratic Party and one of two
opposition members of Parliament.
   The Straits Times newspaper reported that dentists in private
practice, an already crowded field in Singapore, are concerned
about potential competitors from Hong Kong.
   Meantime, while trying to lure likely prospects from Hong Kong,
affluent Singapore faces its own drain of talented people. More
than 4,700 families from what Prime Minister Lee called ``our top
25 percent'' left in 1988, most bound for Australia, New Zealand,
Canada and the United States.
   Exit interviews indicate they left mainly for better job
opportunities, less stressful work and school conditions or to join
relatives.
   ``They want less regulations, more freedom,'' Mah told
Parliament. ``They complain ours is a `one-mistake' society, with
no tolerance for failure, no second chance. They don't want their
children to be pressured in school. They don't want to be told to
excel. In short, they want to opt out of the rat race.''

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega called them
``dignity battalions.'' NBC's Tom Brokaw said ``Norega's goons.''
Should ``anti-abortion'' replace ``pro-life?'' Is it ``crippled''
or ``physically challenged?''
   And what about ``black?'' Why not ``African American?''
   In the quick-draw world of media buzzwords, it's far simpler to
spot a ``pro-democracy'' movement than to find easy answers to
these linguistic dilemmas. After all, one person's ``freedom
fighter'' might be another's ``terrorist.''
   Even what some consider the most straightforward labels now are
being challenged. The Rev. Pat Robertson has objected to being
called a ``televangelist.'' Special Olympics holds that ``hearing
impaired'' is preferable to ``deaf.''
   Why the attention to detail? Public-relations consultants and
special-interest groups are convinced journalistic shorthand
affects public opinion _ one word can shift sympathies in subtle,
but lasting, ways.
   If you're fighting for citizenship, it's better to be called an
``undocumented worker'' than an ``illegal alien.'' And since
``liberal'' has taken on negative connotations, some left-of-center
organizations now say they're ``progressive.''
   The fight over language, politics and the media was examined at
length by George Orwell in 1946. But with the advent of news
compression _ ``Give us 22 minutes, and we'll give you the world!''
_ the semantic scrap has intensified.
   ``The terminology is extremely important,'' said Douglas Gould,
vice president of communications for Planned Parenthood Federation
of America.
   ``It helps form an impression in people's minds about what the
different groups are really all about. ... It is the first step in
framing the debate.''
   Nowhere is the fight over buzzwords more intense than in the
abortion battle. After calling the opposing sides ``pro-abortion''
and ``pro-life'' for several years, the media now often refer to
the rival sides as ``pro-choice'' and ``anti-abortion.''
   Even that description, some journalists and media critics agree,
is biased in favor of abortion-rights advocates: The implication is
that anyone who's not ``pro-choice'' is ``anti-choice.''
   ``The other side wants to be for something, and they want us to
be against something,'' said Dan Donehey, director of public
relations for the National Right to Life Committee, which opposes
abortion. ``The public tends to lean toward a group that is in
favor of something.''
   Yet if reporters were to reverse course and describe Donehey's
constituents as ``pro-life,'' the implication would be that the
other camp is ``anti-life.'' So what's to be done?
   ``The closest that I could come up with, as neutral terms, and
I'm not satisfied with this either, is `abortion-rights advocates'
and `abortion opponents,''' said Jeff Greenfield, a reporter for
ABC News.
   Some organizations send language guidelines to news outlets.
   People with AIDS should be called just that, not AIDS victims,
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation says in its style
guidelines. ``Victim,'' the activists say, is better used to
describe the target of a criminal act.
   Similarly, children born with AIDS should not be called
``innocent victims'' of the disease, as that implies other people
with AIDS are guilty of something, the alliance says.
   In its language guidelines, Special Olympics asks that people
with handicaps not be labeled by their disabilities. ``A person
uses a wheelchair rather than is confined or restricted to a
wheelchair,'' the guidelines say. ``A person has a seizure disorder
or epilepsy, rather than is epileptic.''
   Pat Krebs, director of education for outreach projects for
Special Olympics, acknowledged that some of the guidelines border
on euphemism _ ``physically challenged,'' she said, may not be an
appropriate substitute for ``physically disabled,'' the latter
replacing ``crippled.''
   All the same, even accepted shorthand quickly can become
outdated and offensive. At the turn of the century, the labels used
for degrees of retardation were idiot, imbecile and moron, Krebs
said.
   ``Then (those terms) took on such negative connotations with
society,'' Krebs said. ``So we're constantly changing terminology.''
   Other snappy labels _ ``Star Wars'' or ``pro-democracy'' _ may
add little to our understanding of complicated issues.
   ``The genesis for this is really television, with its short
attention span and its desire to compress everything into little
nuggets of information,'' said media critic Mark Hertsgaard, author
of ``On Bended Knee: The Press and the Reagan Presidency.''
   ``I think the use of shorthand has becomes at least as much a
liability'' as an asset, Hertsgaard said. ``It discourages any kind
of nuance or complex understanding of political events.''
   ``Pro-democracy,'' Hertsgaard and others say, doesn't spell out
differences between movements in China, East Germany,
Czechoslovakia, Poland and the Soviet Union.
   But time is so short for elaboration.
   Said ABC's Greenfield: ``If I'm doing a piece for the network
news, and it's supposed to run 1 minute and 45 seconds, and I say,
`Can I please have 20 more seconds to explain the pro-democracy
movement?'... that might put my piece over. That's why people are
so desperate for those shorthand terms.''

<TEXT>
   The 11-year-old war in Afghanistan has
destroyed much of the country's agrarian economy and helped turn
its small, centuries-old tradition of poppy cultivation into a
multimillion dollar industry.
   Officials say the colorful flowers' sticky yield of opium is
being refined into heroin powder in remote laboratories along the
mountainous Pakistan-Afghanistan frontier and shipped to the West.
   Western narcotics agents estimate that as much as 80 percent of
the heroin sold in Europe and 25 percent sold in the United States
comes now from the region. The remainder is from Mexico and the
``Golden Triangle'' of Southeast Asia, experts say.
   Afghan Aid, a British emergency relief organization, began a
program last June of offering agricultural incentives in hopes of
weaning farmers away from opium poppies in rebel-controlled areas.
   The United States, which has spent billions of dollars as the
main arms supplier for anti-government Moslem guerrillas, plans to
launch a similar program this year.
   No country has felt the effects of the illicit industry more
than Pakistan, through which most of the heroin passes on its way
to the West.
   Khalim Dilkhan, chairman of the Pakistan Narcotics Control
Board, said local agents in 1988 alone seized 13,669 pounds of
heroin, compared with 950 pounds in 1980.
   Narcotics agents say a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of 97 percent pure
heroin fetches $1,000 at the Pakistan-Afghan border.
   ``Multiply that about 100 times for New York City,'' said
Dilkhan.
   He said heroin addiction was virtually unknown in Pakistan, a
Moslem country of 109 million people, but now, more than a million
poor, mainly urban young Pakistanis, are hooked.
   ``In 10 years, the problem has multiplied a thousand times,''
Dilkhan said.
   No statistics are available on the number of addicts in
Afghanistan and experts do not even hazard a guess.
   Opium production, and to some extent export, has existed for
centuries in Afghanistan and what is now Pakistan. But experts said
three events in the late 1970s combined to help make heroin a huge
export industry:
   _Turkey's crackdown on heroin labs operating in eastern
Anatolia, which forced production into western Iran.
   _Iran's Islamic revolution, which purged corrupt officials who
had participated in the opium trade.
   _The war in Afghanistan, sparked by a Marxist coup in 1978,
which has dislocated about half the country's 15 million people and
spawned anarchy in the countryside.
   Soviet combat troops intervened to prop up the Marxist
government in Kabul from December of 1979 to last February, but the
ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan controls only the
country's major cities.
   Almost all the poppy cultivation occurs in areas held by the
U.S.-armed Moslem guerrillas _ the mujahedeen or ``holy warriors''
_ where farmers once raised wheat, corn and barley.
   Experts say these are the areas that have been hit hardest by
artillery shelling and aerial bombing.
   ``The main thing is the destruction of the irrigation systems.
Opium poppy takes very little water,'' said Peter Rees, Afghan
Aid's field director in the frontier city of Peshawar.
   The major mujahedeen groups, which are headquartered in
Pakistan, acknowledge that some of their local commanders are
involved in poppy cultivation. However, the leaders of those groups
deny that they condone it.
   ``In some areas, there must be some benefit to mujahedeen
commanders,'' said Rees. ``But I've seen no clear evidence to show
that high commanders are involved.''
   Pakistani and U.S. narcotics experts based in Pakistan say they
agree with that assessment.
   Afghan Aid's program offers assistance in the form of advice and
development projects to farmers, mainly in Afghanistan's eastern
Nangarhar province, who sign contracts promising not to grow poppy.
   ``In the spring, we'll go and monitor each and every
recipient,'' Rees said. ``I'm reasonably confident they'll uphold
these contracts.''
   The U.S. Congress has approved $12.5 million for a similar,
three-year program to be run by the U.S. Agency for International
Development in consultation with the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.

<HEAD>Deruddere, Like His Hero, Waits Until Spring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like his movie hero, Svevo Bandini,
filmmaker Dominique Deruddere must wait until Spring to see if
America will fulfill his expectations.
   Fortunately for the Belgian director, he stands a better chance
than Bandini, the European immigrant in ``Wait Until Spring,
Bandini,'' a bittersweet tale of Italian family life in the land of
broken dreams.
   With the off-screen backing of Francis Ford Coppola and writer
Charles Bukowski, and sparkling on-screen performances by Faye
Dunaway and Joe Mantegna, Deruddere is confidently awaiting the
U.S. premiere of his movie in Florida at the Festival of Miami on
Feb. 4. National release is set for mid-March.
   The movie opened to good reviews in Western Europe just before
the holiday season, perfect timing for a heartwarming story set in
the cold and snowed-in Rockies.
   ``It would help the film if it were released now in the United
States,'' said Deruddere, sipping an espresso at his favorite Art
Deco bar in Brussels. But at age 32, he doesn't want to get picky
over such things as when and where his movies are shown.
   He made just one full feature film in Belgium. ``Crazy Love,'' a
movie on how rejected love can ultimately lead to necrophilia and
suicide, earned him enough laurels to get a shot at a big break
overseas.
   ``Most European directors have the American dream,'' he said.
``In the end, non-conformists like (Rainer Werner) Fassbinder also
wanted an Oscar. When you're in your bed at night, you just see
yourself standing there on a U.S. movie set.''
   Last February and March, he stood on an American set, and the
reality was sobering. ``It is the just the same as working here.
You're only making a movie.''
   But he had to cut his original plans for shooting ``Bandini'' in
11 weeks down to seven after he could only raise $4 million instead
of $6 million.
   As a result the schedule was so tight, the hours so long he once
fell asleep on the set during the last week. By then, however, he
had already accomplished a Tinsel Town rarity: He stayed within the
budget and the deadline.
   ``It was a miracle,'' Deruddere said, crediting the tiny
European budgets that forced an iron discipline upon him in his
early days. Only half-mockingly, he was told he could become a star
in Hollywood simply on that merit.
   But Deruddere wants to be an artist, not ``an employee.''
   For that reason, he rejected a $15 million offer from American
producers to direct ``Bandini'' provided he relinquished a final
say in the production. Had he accepted, he said, the film's story
line ``would have been too sweet. I wanted to make an emotional
film, not a tear-jerker.''
   Set in Rocklin, Colo., in 1925, ``Wait Until Spring, Bandini''
tells the story of a poor, unemployed Italian bricklayer who has to
feed his large family through the winter.
   Svevo Bandini (Mantegna) loses his money to gambling and his
heart to the rich widow Mrs. Hildegarde (Dunaway), while his wife
(Ornella Muti) prays for his return. In the end, Svevo's son,
Arturo, lures Bandini back into the family fold with a couple of
lies.
   ``It is not such a wholesome theme,'' Deruddere said. ``The
family comes back together because of the lie. The end is very
ambiguous.''
   Central to the story is an Italian immigrant's American dream
and his son's musings about baseball and movie stars _ not the most
obvious subject for a European director. ``It is not typically
American because the dream is seen as something unattainable. The
Italian immigrants can only hope to belong.''
   It also helped that the Bandini family closely resembled his own.
   Coming from Belgium, where just about anything is allowed on the
set, he faced for the first time the strongly regulated U.S. movie
industry.
   ``The homely amateurism that can be so stimulating does not
exist there,'' said Deruddere, whose first task was to find a
non-union state in the Rockies to shoot his film. ``Otherwise the
movie could never be made.''
   He settled on Utah, and location shots were made near Salt Lake
City. Even so, Utah's child labor laws forced him to work at a
``diabolical rhythm'' to ensure the young stars were in bed at
night.
   Shooting was marred by a lack of snow in the Rockies, and
artificial snow had to be used for countless takes. But when
Deruddere himself provided a helping hand in the time consuming
job, some jaws dropped.
   ``When the snow was not spread fast enough, I just got on the
truck to help. Some people freaked out and pointed: `Look at the
director.' You could never do a thing like that in Hollywood.''
   But moving to California is not exactly his dream. ``You don't
have to work there, you have to earn respect there.''

<TEXT>
   For the first time ever, Turkey is
seeking an Academy Award nomination for foreign film, choosing as
its entry a stirring drama about the friendship between a female
political prisoner and a 4-year-old boy in prison with his mother.
   Director Tunc Basaran says it is a major reversal of government
policy that will allow his film, ``Do Not Let Them to Shoot the
Kite,'' to compete.
   ``The history of the Turkish movie industry goes back 75
years,'' the 52-year-old filmmaker said in an interview. ``And for
the first time the government convened a jury to select Turkey's
entry. They would always promise in the past but never did this.''
   More than bureaucratic inertia has been overcome with the choice
of this movie. Turkish officials, who in the past have censored
works that exposed social or political ills in the country, have
paved the way to Los Angeles for a film that takes place in the
women's wing of a high security prison.
   The movie centers around the child Baris, who enters as a baby
when his mother gets a jail term for a drug peddling offense. He
literally is growing up in jail. The practice is common in Turkey
because there are no institutions to care for children of
imprisoned parents.
   The mother is in a ward with women imprisoned for petty crimes.
Most of them are illiterate and unable to deal with the bright and
curious child who is forever asking questions.
   In the next ward are political prisoners, all university
students or graduates, who take over the education of Baris. One of
them, Inci, becomes a special friend to the boy who is heartbroken
when she is released.
   The film is based on a novel by Feride Cicekoglu, an architect
imprisoned for four years after the 1980 military takeover for
belonging to an outlawed leftist organization.
   It is a real life story, director Basaran said. The character
Inci is based on the author.
   Many books and several movies have emerged from the prison
experiences of Turkish artists and intellectuals put behind bars
during the 1980-83 martial law crackdown on leftist and rightist
terrorism.
   Cicekoglu, who also wrote the screenplay, and Basaran have
avoided cheap sentimentality and ideological messages. Nor have
they attempted to support the thesis of the ruling generals that
all the leftists incarcerated were blood-thirsty terrorists.
   The female political prisoners are more peace-loving than the
women convicted of petty crimes, and often break up their fights.
The political prisoners show a strongly human and maternal side in
their concern for Baris, who acts as a bridge between the two
wards. His innocent questions force adults to think over their own
beliefs and ways of expressing them.
   ``Why are you carrying a gun?'' he asks the soldier escorting
his mother during a hospital visit. ``What is a communist?'' he
asks Inci, using a word that would have been censored out of a
movie in the past.
   Basaran said Cicekoglu's story could not be filmed without the
right child actor, Ozan Bilen, who was actually 4 years old when
the movie was shot.
   The five nominations, to be chosen from among 44 entries for the
1990 best foreign film Oscar, will be announced Feb. 17.
   Basaran's movie has already won a Golden Orange, Turkey's
national equivalent of the Oscar, and is a box-office smash in
Istanbul against heavy competition from such foreign films as ``Who
Framed Roger Rabbit.''

   Close your eyes and imagine a band like this on
stage:
   On the right stands cheerful, heavyset Al Anderson. A pink
guitar is strapped around his neck, but he could just as easily be
carrying a clipboard and sending in plays to his quarterback, or
wearing an apron and weighing a package of fresh ground beef.
   On the left is keyboard player Terry Adams, attacking his
instrument like a toddler making mudpies. Elbows, legs and
shoulders fly. His eyes roll to the ceiling, his face frozen in a
silly grin. The ivories seem in danger of coming loose and spilling
over the floor.
   Joey Spampinato, the bassist, is centerstage. He's the romantic
of the group, a long-haired balladeer with a lazy smile and faraway
stare _ the kind of guy who gets away with such corn as ``I Love
Her, She Loves Me.'' People even ask for sheet music to play at
weddings.
   Behind them sits drummer Tom Ardolino. Dark curly hair and beard
to match. The beat is steady, but his head bobs and jerks as if
attached to a spring, like the souvenir dolls sold at baseball
parks.
   The music is clean, fast, loud and everyone shares vocals. The
songs recall the Beatles, the Beach Boys, TV shows, jazz, blues and
just about everything else. The band members look like they've
never had more fun in all their lives.
   Meet the New Rhythm and Blues Quartet, known to Q-heads and
others as NRBQ.
   Adams, who founded the group after meeting Spampinato in Miami
in 1967, sums up their message: ``Don't roll the dice if you can't
pay the price. Everything's possible, everything's impossible.
Ain't no horse that can't be rode, ain't no man that can't be
thow'd.''
   For non-Q-heads, Adams meant this is a band that does what it
wants, no matter what the cost, or lack of cost. That's after more
than 20 years in rock 'n' roll, hundreds of songs and millions of
laughs. All that's missing is a touch of gold.
   A long, very strange trip it's been, their devoted fans divided
between stars _ Keith Richards, Elvis Costello, Ray Davies _ and
plain old Q-heads. One memorable stop came at New York's Fillmore
East back in the early days.
   ``They had this light show,'' Adams recalled, ``and it went on
top of the bands at the Fillmore all the time. We asked them to
turn it off for our set and they got really upset and made it worse.
   ``They were showing films over us, which didn't fit with what we
were doing. I didn't think they had any respect for the music, so
while they were showing the films, we stopped playing, one at a
time, and sat down and watched the films.
   ``That was a kind of turning point in the businees. People said
we were never going to make it because we did that.''
   But what does ``making it'' mean? To NRBQ, making it means
making music. When they're not playing or recording, they're
thinking about it. If they were worried about hit records, could
they possibly be having as much fun after all this time?
   ``I remember friends starting when they hit 30 to say, `I'm
turning 30 and I'm not making any money and I'm getting out,'''
Adams said. ``I thought: `How did you survive this long? You
weren't making any money before, either.'''
   Success for NRBQ means no band member has ever had a regular
job. The only resume these guys have is a lengthy discography,
notably the 1978 release ``At Yankee Stadium'' and the current
``Wild Weekend,'' their first studio record in six years.
   The songs range from agonizing covers of Gordon Lightfoot's
``The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald'' and the Village People's
``Y.M.C.A,'' to Spampinato's Beatle-esque ``This Love Is True'' and
Adams' ``Little Floater,'' a love song about man's best friend, his
car.
   The band plays in true rock 'n' roll spirit; that means have as
much fun as you want, but keep the rhythm going. Anything goes, as
long as you can dance to it. You don't need sheet music to read
between the lines.
   ``You study the music, get good at the instrument, learn
eveything you can and then you've got to throw that all out,''
Adams said. ``You got to drop the academics, you got to be able to
get that part out of the way. You got to start playing music for
the music's sake, rather than what you're going to get
financially.''
   This is good music that's actually good for you, Adams insisted.
Doubters are urged to try a simple test:
   ``You ever see reports where they try music on plant life? They
played classical music for these plants and they did very well and
they did rock music and some of them started shriveling,'' Adams
said.
   ``I always said, `What rock music?' Play our music to the plants
and they won't shrivel.''

<TEXT>
   At various times and to different degrees, Jim
Little was a good cop, a bad cop, a loving husband, a marital
louse, a war hero and a hard-drinking, pot-smoking religious
fanatic.
   He was a loner who often craved companionship, usually female.
   As a crack helicopter pilot, he was a coldly efficient killer
skimming across the jungles of Vietnam or a brazen bandit swooping
down on target banks in Texas, Louisiana and Nevada.
   The quarry in a year-long FBI manhunt, Jim Little today is a
convict.
   In his book ``Once a Hero'' (Texas Monthly Press, $17.95),
author-journalist Howard Swindle launches the saga of Jim Little
with these lines:
   ``Before the sun would hit its zenith on February 15, 1984, an
icy-cold helicopter pilot and four uniformed men carrying automatic
weapons would scare absolute hell out of The System.''
   Bull's-eye!
   What follows is a psychodrama that Texas Monthly Press calls
``the true story of one man's tragic odyssey from Vietnam to
Leavenworth.''
   It is the story of a heavily decorated but mentally confused war
hero who returns from two tours in Vietnam and serves with honor,
distinction and considerable controversy as an Alaska state trooper.
   Little is fired, rehired nd quits, but not before winning
Alaska's Medal of Honor for risking his life to save his partner.
He then becomes one of history's most innovative bank robbers, the
first to use helicopters for the assault and getaway.
   The decline and fall of a genuine American hero ends with Little
in a notoriously oppressive federal prison and locked away with a
multiple cop-killer. In between, the reader is introduced to a
parade of weirdos, including but not limited to Little's airborne
bank robbing buddies.
   According to Swindle, the villain in this gripping story is not
Little, nor is it drugs, drink, scarlet women, religious fanaticism
or even the ``mastermind'' of the daring and dazzling bank heists.
It is post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, a mental affliction
only recently diagnosed and most often linked to Vietnam combat.
   An estimated 500,000 Vietnam veterans suffer from some form of
the disorder, which can be triggered by isolated sounds and sights.
   ``Many of the sufferers still live in the nightmares of scenes
witnessed in the jungles of Vietnam,'' said Swindle, an assistant
managing editor at The Dallas Morning News and himself a Vietnam
combat veteran.
   It is the author's extensive research and reporting of this grim
phenomenon that makes ``Once a Hero'' more than a compelling true
crime story.
   There also is an undercurrent of cruel irony in ``Once a Hero.''
The author went to great lengths to examine and explain
post-traumatic stress disorder and to demonstrate, often painfully,
its time-bomb effect on Jim Little.
   Yet after he was captured, Little refused to use post-traumatic
stress disorder as a defense. He pleaded guilty to bank robbery,
and a federal judge in Texas sentenced him to 25 years in prison.
   Swindle points out that a government which Little once served so
vigorously seemed disinclined to recognize and respond to his
plight or the plight of others like him.
   ``Prisons punish the manifestation of the act,'' he observed.
``They do not probe the mental process that motivated it.''
   Despite his guilty plea, Little remains despondent and
disillusioned.
   ``Am I bitter?'' he wrote in one of many letters critical of a
government he calls the Beast. ``Wouldn't you be? I went to Vietnam
twice and enforced the law in Alaska the best I could. And the
Beast betrayed me both times. I fought back in the only way I knew
how and the Beast put me in prison.
   ``Yeah, I guess you could say I'm bitter. There's nothing left.
The Beast has it all.''
   Near the end of his book, Swindle writes:
   ``Until age 37, Jim Little was a starched, creased example of
public service and staunch defender of traditional American values.
For 12 years he had worn Army green; for four years, he had worn
Trooper blue. In both uniforms, his colleagues held him as an
example of excellence.
   ``Little has been incarcerated more than three years, and no one
has asked him why he inexplicably robbed a bank on a February
morning in 1984.''

   Maureen Lipman plays Joyce Grenfell.
   Who?, you ask. If the play works, says its star, it shouldn't
matter if these names mean anything or not.
   ``You don't have to know either to enjoy both,'' Lipman said of
her solo turn as British actress and revue artist Joyce Grenfell,
whom she plays in ``Re:Joyce!'' at the Long Wharf Theater in New
Haven, Conn., through March 4.
   ``That's going to be the issue, really: whether the show stands
or falls on its own merits without pre-knowledge of the lady
herself,'' she said. ``It doesn't matter whether audiences know
me.''
   In Britain, they certainly do. Lipman is as much a household
name as was the gawky, angular Grenfell, whose films include ``The
Happiest Days of Your Life'' (1950) and ``The Belles of St.
Trinian's'' (1954).
   ``Re:Joyce!'' was one of London's most successful West End plays
of the past few seasons. Co-written by Lipman and James
Roose-Evans, it began at a suburban theater south of London in
February 1988 and opened on the West End that September. It was
brought back twice to meet demand, and the 43-year-old Lipman says
the show is with her for life.
   ``I don't suppose I'll ever stop doing it now,'' the actress
said over lunch at Elstree studios 13 miles north of London, where
she is filming some television commercials for British Telecom.
   ``I don't like repeating myself, but somehow I feel impassioned
to take this show on the road,'' said Lipman, who plans a tour of
Britain and Australia following the Long Wharf run.
   ``I don't think I'm ever going to get a better vehicle, so why
should I throw it away?''
   Born a tailor's daughter to a middle-class Jewish family in
northern England, Lipman acknowledges that her background could not
be further removed from her subject's. Actress-comedian Grenfell
was a Christian Scientist and, as a niece of the viscountess and
member of Parliament Nancy Astor, moved in glittering circles.
   But Lipman says she and Joyce Grenfell nonetheless have their
affinities: ``I did always have a cartoonist's eye, and so did she.
It's almost an inability to hear what people say because I'm so
fascinated by the way they say it, which is what she had.
   ``She would much rather be the clown of the class, as I did. ..
. She had a very pretty and outgoing mother who was much more
attractive than she was. We share that,'' Lipman said of Grenfell,
who died in 1979 of eye cancer, at age 69.
   ``Re:Joyce!'' combines several of Grenfell's best-known sketches
_ a nursery school class, a girls' reunion, a Women's Institute
meeting _ with songs and occasional commentary.
   But Lipman said her show ``must not be seen as a piece of
whimsy. ... It's very, very delicate. We have found the shape, and
it's right.''
   The play is one of several activities that have kept the actress
busy of late. She starred on British television this fall in
``About Face,'' six original plays, one of which was written by her
husband, Jack Rosenthal.
   Her British Telecom TV commercials have made her Britain's most
recognizable Jewish mother. In them, a gray-haired, dowdily dressed
Lipman plays the aging Beattie, whose one wish in life is that her
son phone more frequently.
   Her theater credits range from London's best musical revival
this decade _ Leonard Bernstein's ``Wonderful Town'' in 1986 _ to
the maid in the 1971 production of ``Long Day's Journey Into
Night'' with Laurence Olivier and Constance Cummings.
   Lipman has often visited the United States but has never before
performed there, and says she has no desire to be the latest Briton
to conquer Broadway.
   ``I don't think I have the driving ambition to conquer anything
except myself,'' she said wryly.
   ``This is why in a way I'm glad I'm going there in a small
theater and quietly, and if they wish to come and see the show and
discover it, that's wonderful. If they don't, then it's an
experience, and I come home and carry on doing what I'm doing.''

   Not long ago, it looked as if Home
Shopping Network Inc.'s picture tube had gone kaput.
   The television retailer was losing money for the first time. A
big lawsuit against GTE Corp. boomeranged into a $100 million libel
award for the telecommunications giant. Analysts and investors were
ready to play taps for the company that had popularized zirconium
cube jewelry peddled live on TV.
   The tune has changed. Home Shopping Network is rebounding. Its
stock has more than doubled since hitting a low of $3 in mid-1989.
Sales are setting records. The GTE issue was settled in November
for $4.5 million in insurance.
   What had been diagnosed as a fatal cash hemorrhage turned out to
be just a near-death experience that led to some serious rethinking
by once-cocky HSN executives.
   ``The one thing you can say about Home Shopping Network is it
takes a licking and keeps on ticking,'' said Peter Grandich, a
securities analyst at Affiliated Financial Management Inc. in
Howell, N.J. ``After the GTE award, everyone thought the party was
over.''
   The relatively painless resolution with GTE was a fortuitous
boost for the 4-year-old company, now leaner after shedding several
unprofitable ventures to concentrate on TV sales operations.
   But HSN no longer is the undisputed titan of the TV marketplace
following the merger of two rivals. It also is engrossed in another
courtroom brawl, this time with junk-bond investment firm Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   That battle, which could determine the value of $100 million
worth of HSN securities issued in 1986, illustrates the company's
crash landing after years of heady expansion.
   In dispute are bonds that pay interest of 5.5 percent and are
convertible to HSN stock. They were an immediate hit, reflecting
investor confidence in the Clearwater, Fla.-based company that had
dazzled TV viewers with buying opportunities on items ranging from
ersatz diamond rings to vitamin pills.
   The price of HSN shares climbed to $47, making the convertible
bonds even more attractive.
   But rising costs and unprofitable diversification began to erode
gains, and the stock weakened. It took a big beating after HSN
became mired in the $1.5 billion suit against Stamford, Conn.-based
GTE, claiming an inadequate telephone system cost HSN $500 million
in business in 1986 and '87.
   When the date arrived to reset the bond's conversion rate in
1987, HSN shares were worth a fraction of their earlier value.
Drexel, the bond's underwriter, negotiated a conversion rate of
$7.05 a share, down from the original $28.50.
   Before the change could take effect, however, HSN sued in
federal court in Tampa claiming Drexel artificially manipulated HSN
stock down to get the lower conversion price on the bonds.
   HSN claimed Drexel's motive was to reap huge profits by selling
the bonds later if HSN's stock price rose. Drexel is fighting the
suit and a hearing is set for Jan. 17 in Tampa federal court.
   For its fiscal quarter ending Nov. 30, HSN reported sales up 27
percent from a year earlier to a quarterly record $255.2 million.
After-tax profit nearly doubled to more than $20 million.
   ``To paraphrase Twain, `Reports of our death were greatly
exaggerated,''' said Nando DiFilippo, HSN's general counsel.
   HSN also plans to discontinue its financial service operations
and scale down a pharmaceutical unit to include only its line of
vitamins. HSN now reaches about half the nation's homes via cable
or regular channels.
   ``We're going to stick with the business we do best: video
retailing,'' said Les Wandler, HSN's chief financial officer.
``When you have a gold mine, you mine gold. You don't go looking
for other business. We learned that.''
   The merger of two competitors, CVN Cos. of Minneapolis and QVC
Network of West Chester, Pa., could pose a strategic threat to HSN,
which tried unsuccessfully in 1987 to merge with CVN. But HSN
executives say they aren't worried.
   ``The more people get used to buying off television, the better
off everyone in the industry is,'' Wandler said.
   Larry Gerbrandt, a media analyst at Paul Kagen Associates in
Carmel, Calif., said the HSN stock could dip if bondholders
exercise their stock-conversion option once the Drexel suit is
resolved.
   But he said assets such as its St. Petersburg-based studios and
cable network give HSN intrinsic value.
   ``I see HSN well north of $12 a share,'' he said.
   ``The GTE suit was a misadventure that totally distracted Home
Shopping Network from its core business,'' said Gerbrandt.
``They've gotten a second chance.''

<TEXT>
   While attention focused on Mikhail Gorbachev's
domestic problems and the U.S. handcuffs on Manuel Noriega, the
business world witnessed its own intrigues, which touched two
troubled tycoons and products ranging from securities to mushroom
soup.
   Canadian developer Robert Campeau lost more control of his
debt-ridden retailing network this past week, while halfway around
the globe, money-hungry creditors circled Australian entrepreneur
Alan Bond like the toothy sharks of the Great Barrier Reef.
   At the same time, leadership changes hit Campbell Soup Co.,
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and the Fisher-Price toymaking
subsidiary of Quaker Oats Co.
   None of these developments were related. But they showed how
swiftly corporate crises can lead straight to the top, just as the
Soviet Union's ethnic unrest has raised speculation about the
political future of Gorbachev, and Panama's chaos resulted in the
demise of dictator Noriega.
   For Campeau, the body blows have come one after another in the
past several weeks, hitting the Toronto businessman at the height
of the holiday shopping season on which his retailing chains depend
for survival.
   National Bank of Canada threw the latest punch, seizing about
half his voting shares in the company that bears Campeau's name
after he defaulted on loans for which he'd pledged the shares as
collateral.
   The bank's move intensifies pressure on Campeau to restructure
or sell the department stores he acquired during the 1980s, which
saddled his operations with nearly $8 billion in debt that the
businesses are having trouble repaying. The latest development also
raised new doubt about the business future of Campeau himself, who
has speculated in property for nearly half his 63 years.
   In Australia, meanwhile, the troubled empire of Alan Bond got
more bad news when U.S. investors joined the battle against his
Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd., which owns businesses ranging from
newspapers to beer breweries and is nearly $6 billion in debt. Bond
won a reprieve Friday from a move to liquidate his operations but
he still must fend off angry creditors.
   The senior management changes at Campbell, Shearson and
Fisher-Price came as little surprise, because each company's
performance has foundered.
   But for Campbell at least, the appointment of new chief
executive David Johnson after a yearlong search could have little
bearing on the company's future. Campbell's future could depend on
the outcome of infighting among the controlling Dorrance family,
some of whom want to sell the business and have made Campbell a
takeover target.
   Shearson, the Wall Street giant known for its solemn ``We
Believe'' TV commercials about investing, raised questions about
what its top leaders believe themselves. Jeffrey B. Lane, the chief
operating officer until he recently was demoted by Chairman Peter
A. Cohen in a restructuring, abruptly quit. Cohen had partly blamed
Shearson's slumping business on Lane, a longtime friend.
   Slumping business also felled Fisher-Price's president R. Bruce
Sampsell, who quit after a poor Christmas sales performance for the
toymaker. Parent company Quaker Oats named experienced manager Paul
E. Price to replace him.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _While domestic automakers flaunted futuristic cars at auto
shows in Los Angeles and Detroit, more bad news rolled in about
lousy sales and the growing dominance of foreign rivals. Sales of
North American-made vehicles plunged in late December, capping a
year in which 1 million fewer cars were sold and the first car with
a foreign name became the bestseller, Japan's Honda Accord.
   _Major retailers said pre-Christmas buying boosted sales about
5.5 percent but the gains were uneven, mainly benefiting apparel
stores. Some analysts said the sales gains were eroded by
aggressive discounting.
   _Oil prices surged to the highest levels in four years because
of cold weather and rising demand. But the long-term outlook for
the energy market remained unclear and some petroleum experts
predicted prices would decline again soon, lessening the impact on
consumers.
   _Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods rose 2.4
percent in November to their second-highest level ever, the
Commerce Department reported. Separately, the Labor Department said
U.S. unemployment held steady at 5.3 percent in December.

<HEAD>Real Estate Worries Hit Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The real-estate scare that hit Wall Street in
the waning weeks of 1989 now has prompted many analysts to
reappraise their economic forecasts for the new year.
   These observers have set out to look beyond the problems that
might arise for builders, brokers, bankers and others whose
business fortunes are directly linked to the health of the real
estate market.
   Rather, they are trying to sort out whether weak demand and
prices for properties might depress consumer spending in general,
and create new difficulties for the Federal Reserve in its effort
to avoid a recession.
   Many analysts maintain that recent talk of a developing
downtrend in home prices across the country has been excessive, if
not utterly unwarranted.
   ``Home prices are down in some areas, up in others, and in
general disappointing,'' said John Connolly, an analyst at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``They are not crashing, however, despite the tales of woe that
are frequently cited. The notion of a housing market disaster
doesn't square with the numbers.''
   Richard Hoey, economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., agrees
that the ``worst case'' projections now made in some quarters for
real estate are unlikely to come true.
   But he argues that the mere idea of a letdown in the
long-buoyant property market could still have an important
emotional impact on the economy and contribute to a recession.
   ``Real estate is the core of middle-class net worth,'' Hoey
observes. ``Negative sentiment on real estate prices can help
depress consumer confidence and spending, above and beyond any
direct wealth effect from actual price changes.''
   When homeowners worry that their houses have become less readily
saleable at or near presumed market value, Hoey says, they may
decide to spend less and save more of their incomes.
   ``In this sense,'' he says, ``the psychic liquidity of housing
wealth can drop more sharply than average house prices themselves
and can rebound more rapidly than house prices themselves.
   ``We would note that the weakest housing market, the Northeast,
is the center not only of the financial community but also of the
national media. Thus it is quite possible that the news flow about
real estate may be more negative than the reality on a nationwide
basis.
   ``Negative media coverage of real estate price trends is likely
to have only a limited impact on the wealth effect but could have a
more substantial impact on the psychic liquidity effect.''
   Such concerns about the business outlook made their presence
felt in the stock market's first trading week of 1990, blunting a
strong early rally right after New Year's.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 56.95 points on
Tuesday, showed a net gain for the week of just 20.05, at 2,773.25,
by Friday's close.
   Other readings for the week showed the New York Stock Exchange
composite index down .40 at 194.64; the NASDAQ composite index for
the over-the-counter market up 3.40 at 458.22, and the American
Stock Exchange market value index up 4.45 at 382.45.
   Big Board volume averaged 172.48 million shares a day, up from
121.33 million the week before.
   Whether real estate fears are exaggerated or not, many analysts
continue to assert that the situation isn't one to dismiss lightly.
   ``Since October 1987, Americans have not quite viewed their
paper wealth in quite the same way as before,'' say the economists
David A. Levy and S. Jay Levy in their business advisory letter
Industry Forecast.
   ``With the boom in real estate prices over in the Northeast and
ending in the West, home equity is no longer the rationale for
spending freely that it once was.''
   Even an optimist like Connolly acknowledges, ``Notwithstanding
the numbers, real estate jitters will remain with us until the
current economic picture clarifies.''

conservative sales growth.
   General merchandise chains, department stores and discounters on

for a moderate holiday season.
   Analysts said the industry was saved from a lackluster sales
performance by price discounts, aggressive advertising and special

   Overall late-December sales of North
American-made vehicles fell 10.5 percent from the same period in
1988, although buyer incentives spurred a rise in light truck
sales, the companies reported.
   The period completed a year that saw annual sales fall by some 1
million vehicles from 1988, and for the first time saw a car with a
foreign automaker's nameplate _ the Honda Accord _ become the
nation's best-selling car.
   The figures released Thursday provided further evidence of the

   Alan Bond's struggle for corporate
survival edged closer to collapse as U.S. investors joined the
battle against Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. and an Australian Supreme
Court said it would rule on a government request to liquidate the
company's assets.
   A ruling in favor of the State Government Insurance Commission,
which asked the court to appoint a provisional liquidator, would
topple Bond's media, brewing, natural resources and real estate
empire. Bond Corp. has asked the court to dismiss the commission's
petition.

   Stock prices lost ground Thursday amid increasing doubts about
the staying power of the rally that greeted the start of 1990. The
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 13.65 points to
2,796.08.
   A group of European central banks launched a surprise attack on
the dollar that sent the U.S. currency tumbling around the world.
Gold prices were mixed.
   Bond prices were unchanged to marginally higher.
   Hog and pork belly futures prices shot up their permitted daily
limits; oil and orange juice futures turned lower; precious metals
advanced strongly; and grains and soybeans were mixed.

<HEAD>National Bank of Canada Seizes Campeau Stock</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Retail Sales, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Bank of Canada said it had seized
13 million shares of Campeau Corp. after a company controlled by
Robert Campeau defaulted on loans from the bank.
   National Bank President Andre Berard said Thursday that Campeau,
the chairman of the struggling retailing and developing firm, had
personally taken out the loan _ the amount of which was not
revealed _ to purchase stock in Campeau Corp.
   The bank said the 13 million shares, which had been held by
Robert Campeau, represented 29 percent`of the voting stock in
Campeau Corp.
   The bank's decision to transfer the stock to its name had
nothing to do with the recent deterioration in Campeau Corp.
finances, Berard said.
   ``It's a different matter altogetherl'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   A Campeau Corp. spokeswoman, Carole Sanger, said in Cincinnati,
``It is a personal situation involving the bank and Robert Campeau
and it would be inappropriate for the company to comment.'' A
reporter calling Robert Campeau's office in Toronto was referred to
Ms. Sanger.
   National Bank said it had also seized about $60 million in
debentures that it held as security and has taken steps to have
transferred to its name another 4 million of Campeau Corp.'s
subordinate preference shares.
   The bank said in a statement the shares were provided as
collateral by Robert Campeau Capital Inc. and a second company. The
latter firm had received the loan from the National Bank.
   National Bank said its action ``aims at consolidating its
position'' pending the outcome of restructuring negotiations for
Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp.
in the United States. Berard said the bank wanted the parties
involved in those talks to be aware that it now owned the stock.
   On Tuesday, a syndicate of banks led by Citibank agreed not to
declare Federated and Allied in technical default on $2.34 billion
in loans.
   The syndicate agreed not to press the point before Jan. 15,
giving Campeau more time to show it is making progress`in sorting
out its financial problems. The bankers previously said they might
ask for full repayment of the loan, a demand that presumably could
have forced Campeau to file for protection under U.S. bankruptcy
laws.
   In exchange for the delay, Federated agreed to pay off a $250
million bridge loan.
   Campeau Corp., which owns 258 stores, went heavily into debt to
buy Federated for`$6.6 billion in 1988 and to take over Allied at a
cost of $3.4 billion in 1986.
   The company announced in September it was having trouble making
its interest payments. Besides the bank loans, the company must pay
interest on approximately $7 billion in high-yield junk bonds it
sold to finance the buyouts.
   Campeau is trying to sell its star Bloomingdale's department
store chain.
   National Bank said the voting rights on the stock will now be
exercised by National Bank representatives, the bank said.
   Berard said in a statement the bank does not intend to dispose
of the Campeau securities or acquire additional ones.
   Beside's Bloomingdale's, Federated's divisions include Abraham &amp;
Strauss, Burdines, Lazarus, and Rich's. Allied's divisions are
Jordan Marsh, Stern's, Maas, Jordan Marsh Florida, and The Bon
Marche.

   The accord, announced Thursday, marks the first time in its

with more than one U.S. carrier for the provision of voice
services, MCI said. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., MCI's
biggest competitor, has been the only U.S. company in that position
for several years.
   MCI and Telefonos de Mexico expect to begin providing voice
service early next week.
   Under the operating agreement, MCI also will provide to the
Mexican company certain MCI training programs and technical
expertise.
   There is no monetary value attached to the agreement, said Jane

<HEAD>Iran Plans to Become Major Steel Exporter, Minister Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran is set to become a major steel
exporter through plans to invest 1 trillion rials, or around $15
billion, in the steel sector, an Iranian minister`said.
   Musa Lankarani, deputy mines and metals minister, was quoted
Thursday by the official Islamic Republic News Agency as saying
that a major part of that amount already has been invested.
   Several steel plants will become operational during the first
5-year development plan, Lankarani was quoted as saying by IRNA,
monitored in Nicosia.
   He said once all the projects are completed Iranian steel
production will reach 7 million tons a year.
   Iran currently has to import steel. President Hashemi Rafsanjani
said during a visit to the Ahvaz steel complex`in southern
Khuzestan province last month that Iran currently needs 6 million
tons of steel a year.
   He added that the government had paid special attention to the
steel sector in its 5-year plan and should ``strive for exporting
steel.''
   A steel mill in the southern city of Isfahan, the largest in the
country, is currently being expanded with Soviet assistance and its
eventual capacity has been estimated at 4 million tons a year.
   A Soviet-Iranian economic cooperation agreement signed by
Rafsanjani in Moscow last September also envisages the construction
of steel rolling mills in Khorassan, Hormozgan and Azerbaijan
provinces.

<HEAD>Avon: No Longer Exploring Sale of Giorgio Fragrance Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cosmetics maker Avon Products Inc. said it has
given up the idea of selling its Giorgio Beverly Hills retail
fragrance division.
   A company spokeswoman said Thursday that potential buyers didn't
offer adequate amounts.
   The company also said the sale of its smaller retail subsidiary,
Parfums Stern, has been completed. Parfums Stern was bought for
$210 million in cash by Safrep, an affiliate of Sanofi, the
diversified French company specializing in perfumes and beauty
products, pharmaceuticals and food ingredients.
   Parfums Stern markets the Oscar de la Renta, Cher, Perry Ellis
and Deneuve fragrances. They will be added to Sanofi's stable of
well-known beauty product brands including Nina Ricci and Stendhal.
   Sanofi, which has annual sales of more than $2 billion, is part
of the Societe National Elf Acquitaine Group.
   Proceeds from the sale of Parfums Stern will go toward reducing
Avon's debt, the company said in a news release. Avon previously
had said its debt totaled $1 billion at mid-year.
   Avon decided to stop exploring the possibility of selling
Giorgio Beverly Hills when it didn't receive high enough bids.
   ``We had some interested bidders,'' Avon spokeswoman Elaine
Benvenuto said. ``We didn't think the offers reflected the inherent
value of the company.''
   She declined to disclose how much Avon waned for the division
that markets the Giorgio Beverly Hills and Red fragrance lines,
among the country's hottest sellersn
   Giorgio and Parfums Stern were together expected to do $300
million in sales for 1988, Avon said when it first announced it
might sell the subsidiaries. Avon didn't provide separate sales
estimates for each one.
   Avon, known chiefly as a direct marketer of cosmetics and other
personal products, announced in September that it was looking into
the sale of Giorgio and Parfums Stern.
   At the time, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer James E.
Preston said a final decision hadn't been reached to divest the two
retail holdings.
   The reduction of debt has been part of Avon's plan to improve
its balance sheet. The company has sold off its health care
services subsidiaries to focus on its core direct-marketing
business.
   The strategy aimed at improving profitability was accelerated
last year when Avon became a takeover target.

<HEAD>Typesetter Settles SEC Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A typesetting company worker accused in the
Business Week insider trading investigation has settled civil
charges that he illegally traded on confidential information from
advance copies of the magazine.
   Without admitting or denying guilt, the defendant, John Joseph
Lynch, agreed Thursday to pay more than $44,000 in alleged illegal
profits, interest and fines to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   Lynch, 29, of Leonia, N.J., works for Applied Graphics
Technology of Carlstadt, N.J., where Business Week is typeset. He
was suspended with pay after the SEC charges were filed Nov. 30.
   The civil SEC complaint alleged that between April and November,
Lynch purchased securities of at least 22 companies he knew would
be mentioned in upcoming editions of Business Week.
   The SEC said Lynch passed on tips to his girlfriend and her
family, who also traded on the information but were not charged.
   The case against Lynch was of interest because the alleged
illegal trades took place long after the SEC settled several
similar, highly publicized cases.
   The Business Week investigation also resulted in criminal cases.
S.G. (Rudy) Ruderman, a former Business Week broadcast editor, and
William Dillon, a former Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. stockbroker, both
pleaded guilty to trading on advance information and were sentenced
to six months in prison.
   Lynch's settlement calls for him to pay back his and his
girlfriend's alleged illegal profits of $30,324 and $1,067 in
interest. He also was fined $14,768.

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Price cuts, an advertising blitz and special promotions helped
the nation's major retailers ring up moderate holiday sales gains.
   But the results reported Thursday by the nation's major
retailers confirmed that this past Christmas was a time of
conservative spending compared to Christmas 1988.
   General merchandise chains, department stores and discounters
posted December results that mostly met their expectations _ a
fairly unexciting holiday season.
   Walter Loeb of the investment firm Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
estimated that industrywide sales grew about 5 percent in December
compared with the same month a year earlier, down from a 7.5
percent`increase in December 1988.
   The performances differed depending on the type of retailer,
while various regional factors, such as the weather, also had an
impact. Store executives generally expressed satisfaction with
their results. But some retailers said they didn't get as much as
they had anticipated for Christmas.
   Retailers' sales are considered an indicator of total consumer
spending, which accounts for the bulk of the nation's economic
activity.
   The holidays are a crucial time for retailers because half or
more of their profits come from sales between Thanksgiving and
Christmas. Worried about softness in consumer spending, this past
year retailers poured on the promotions, many offering big
pre-Christmas bargains.
   ``If the retailer hadn't had the hook out he wouldn't have had
any customers in the stores,'' said Loeb, only half-jokingly.
   Still, he said, sales were a bit better than he had expected.
Unusually cold weather in parts of the country spurred purchases of
warm clothing and automotive products. Car batteries and snow tires
were mentioned as fast sellers by some general merchandise chains _
but the items weren't meant for under the Christmas tree.
   One of the most upbeat assessments came from Kenneth A. Macke,
chairman and chief executive officer of Dayton Hudson Corp., who
said solid gains at all divisions were ``more encouraging because
they came on top of a strong December'' in 1988. Dayton Hudson,
owner of department stores plus the Target discount chain, reported
an overall increase of 15.1 percent.
   Contrary to the industry trend, Macke said, Dayton Hudson was
slightly less promotional than the year before. Analysts said
Dayton Hudson probably had a more profitable season than many other
retailers that relied heavily on markdowns to attract customers.
   Price cutting is assumed to have taken a bite out of profits but
earnings won't suffer too much, thanks to tight inventory and other
cost controls as well as fairly low inflation, analysts said.
   Stores catering to clothing shoppers fared better than mass
merchants that have much of their business devoted to expensive
durable goods, such as stereos, televisions or home appliances.
   The large specialty apparel retailer Limited Inc. reported an 11
percent gain in December sales. But not counting stores opened in
the past year, Limited's sales rose a more moderate 5 percent.
   Retailers and industry analysts attach greater significance to
tallies that exclude newly opened stores. Results at stores open at
least a year, called comparable- or same-store sales, are
considered a better guide to a retailer's health.
   The biggest retailer in the country, Sears, Roebuck and Co., had
a mediocre showing but it probably wasn't any worse than the
company's internal forecasts. A low pricing policy adopted last
March to help Sears compete with faster growing discount rivals has
cut into Sears' results.
   Sears said its sales rose 3.6 percent in the five weeks ended
December 30 to $4.696 billion from $4.53 billion a year earlier.
But on a same-store basis Sears eked out only a 1.6 percent gain.
   Among other retailers reporting Thursday:
   K mart Corp., which ranks second behind Sears based on 1988
annual revenue, said its December sales rose 11.8 percent to $5.12
billion from $4.58 billion a year earlier. Its same-store sales
rose 3.1 percent.
   Fast-growing Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the third largest U.S.
retailer, posted a 22 percent overall December sales gain, to $3.63
billion from the year-earlier's $2.97 billion, and an 8 percent
same-store sales increase.
   Among stores that predominantly sell apparel:
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said its sales rose 9.7 percent to $2.72
billion from $2.48 billion in December 1988. Comparable-store sales
were up 8.6 percent.
   May Department Stores Co. said its sales rose 8.7 percent to
$1.80 billion from $1.65 billion and same-store sales were up 5.9
percent.
   Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. reported sales rose 3.5 percent
to $531.4 million from $513.4 million. The same-store gain was 3
percent.
   Philip M. Hawley, chairman and chief executive officer of the
West Coast retailer, said sales were slightly below the planned
amount due to unseasonable weather in parts of California and
elsewhere.

<HEAD>Sales Skid Again, But Not Trucks; Accord is Best Seller in 1989</HEAD>

   Late-December`car and truck sales dropped 10.5
percent, while for the first time, a vehicle with a foreign
nameplate has become the best-seller of the year in the United
States.
   Americans bought more Honda Accords in 1989 than any other
automobile, according to figures released Thursday.
   ``Obviously, we're real pleased about it,'' said American Honda
Motor Co. spokesman Bob Butorac. About 60 percent of Honda's
Accords sold in the United States were built at the company's plant
in Marysville, Ohio. The rest were built in Japan.
   For the year, U.S. and foreign automakers said their U.S. sales
of cars and light trucks fell 5.5 percent from 1988, to 14.6
million from 15.4 million.
   Americans bought 362,707 Accords last year, topping the Ford
Taurus`at 348,061 and the Ford Escort, last year's sales leader, at
333,535. Rounding out the top five were the Chevrolet Corsica and
Beretta, which are variations on the same model, at 326,006 and the
Chevrolet Cavalier at 295,715.
   ``We're not talking about a car that is particularly stylish,''
auto analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York said of the Accord. ``But it's a supremely competent vehicle,
it does everything very well.''
   The eight major automakers`with U.S. assembly plants said they
sold cars and light trucks at an average daily rate of 39,798
during Dec. 21-31, compared with a rate of 44,477 during the same
time the year before.
   The late-December skid was softened by strong light-truck sales
by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., both of which placed
incentives on their popular minivans in the middle of the month.
General Motors Corp. didn't follow suit.
   Car sales tumbled 20.2 percent but truck sales, bolstered by the
minivan rebates and low-interest`loan deals, soared 10 perent.
   In mid- and late-December 1988, automakers loaded their dealers
with lots of incentive cash to move cars off showroom floors by
year's end. The selling rate for late December 1988 was the highest
for that year.
   Despite the decline in year-to-year comparisons between the
periods, Phillippi said: ``Incentives work on everything. The
(selling) pace picked up nicely in the last 10 days.''
   In mid-December 1989, Chrysler slapped incentives on a variety
of its vehicles, including, for the first time, rebates on the
Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager minivans. Ford followed suit
with incentives on its Aerostar minivan.
   Chrysler's light truck sales jumped 19.8 percent in late
December while Ford's rose 16.1 percent. Meanwhile, truck sales by
GM, which did not have new incentives in December, slipped 1.6
percent.
   Overall, 1989 appeared to be the automakers' seventh-best sales
year, pending release of heavy-truck sales figures. Including
heavy-truck sales, the automakers sold 15.8 million vehicles in
1988.
   Final 1989 sales of the big rigs won't be completed until later,
but if past selling patterns hold, automakers will wind up selling
about 1 million fewer vehicles in 1989 than in 1988. The industry's
best year was in 1986, when 16.3 million vehicles were sold.
   ``It's been two years since the industry peaked and that
suggests that we're closer to the trough,'' said auto analyst Doug
Laughlin of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. of New York.
   During the past several months, auto executives and others have
speculated that the first half of 1990 would be a weak period, with
a rebound coming in the second half of the year.
   ``It's already starting to be a rather lengthy downturn in
autos,'' Laughlin said. ``The duration of the industry downturn has
been about 2 to 2{ years.''
   The current slide in auto sales began in October.
   Chrysler, which used incentives extensively in 1989, reported a
2.1 percent decline in late-December total vehicle sales compared
with the same period in 1988. Car sales at the nation's No. 3
automaker were down 24.1 percent.
   For all of 1989, Chrysler's combined car and truck sales`were
down 7.1 percent compared with 1988.
   Ford said its cars and trucks sold at a pace 9.5 percent slower
in late December than during the same period in 1988. Car sales
fell 22.4 percent. Ford's vehicle sales in 1989 showed a 3.9
percent decline compared with 1988 sales.
   GM said its combined car and truck sales for late-December last
year came in 21.3 percent behind the swollen period in 1988. Car
sales were down 29 percent. For 1989, GM's car and light truck
sales ran 6.7 percent behind the pace set in 1988.

<HEAD>Futures Regulators Consider Dual Trading Limits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators have taken the first,
tentative step in what may be a long journey toward barring brokers
from trading for themselves as well as their customers.
   The practice is known as dual trading, and while legal it has
been controversial in the wake of fraud scandals at the nation's
two largest futures exchanges.
   Officials of those exchanges, the Chicago Board of Trade and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, immediately criticized the move
Thursday by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   The federal agency voted to consider placing some restrictions
on dual trading on some contracts at the seven largest futures
exchanges.
   The five-member CFTC, which oversees the futures industry, voted
unanimously to submit for public comment a proposed rule that would
phase in some limits on dual trading over a 12-month period.
   Critics claim dual trading creates the potential for conflicts
of interest and possible fraud.
   Supporters, however, say dual trading helps keep markets liquid
_ and thus less volatile _ when there are few customer orders.
   Not all futures exchanges would be affected by the proposed
rules change, which may not win final approval for as much as a
year.
   Upon approval, the initial dual trading restrictions will be
reviewed and the CFTC will consider extending or easing those
limits, said Chairwoman Wendy Gramm.
   ``We do intend to proceed carefully and thoughtfully in that
process,'' she said.
   The CFTC also voted unanimously to accept a staff recommendation
that the agency keep closer tabs on ``broker associations'' to
prevent possible trading abuses such as those undercovered in
Chicago last year.
   In November, the CFTC released a study disputing the economic
benefits of dual trading.
   But Commissioner Robert Davis, who reluctantly agreed to submit
the proposal for public comment _ as a way of obtaining more data _
expressed reservations about making a decision based on a single
study.
   ``Before tampering with the formula, other hypotheses must be
tested, other data must be analyzed and alternative explanations of
the results must be considered,'' he said.
   Legislation that would severely limit dual trading is pending in
both the House and Senate.
   The proposal would bar floor brokers from trading or placing
futures or options orders for their own accounts while handling a
customer's order on the same day in the same commodity.
   The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
which account for about 90 percent of the nation's futures trading
volume, would each be required to impose dual trading restrictions
on just one of their three most actively traded agricultural
commodities and their single-most active financial commodityn
   Five other exchanges _ the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
Commodity Exchange Inc., the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange Inc.,
the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange and the New York Cotton Exchange
_ would have to impose restrictions on only one of their two most
active commodities.
   And four smaller exchanges _ the Kansas City Board of Trade,
Minneapolis Grain Exchange, New York Futures Exchange and the
Chicago Rice and Cotton Exchange _ would be exempt from
restrictions during the implementation period.
   CBOT President and Chief Executive Thomas R. Donovan said:
``There are futures exchanges developing all around the world and
most allow dual trading. If we cannot handle customer business
because of ill-founded restrictions on trading, then we will lose
that business to our foreign competitors.''
   Added CBOT Chairman Karsten Mahlmann, ``The CFTC's proposal to
ban dual trading flies in the face of the evidence of its own
study, which shows benefits from dual trading and which provides no
evidence that dual trading imposes costs or harms customers.''
   On broker associations, the CFTC staff recommended adopting a
rule defining the term and requiring exchanges to register the
members of such associations.
   The commission's Division of Trading and Markets said
registration of broker association members would allow exchanges to
monitor their trading activity as a safeguard against abuses.
   Broker associations are formal or informal groups of futures
traders formed to provide more capital to finance trades and more
people to handle them.
   Supporters of broker associations claim they help service
customer orders by increasing the capital of individual brokers and
providing continuous service.
   But the CFTC staff found that broker associations ``may increase
the potential for certain types of trading abuses.''
   The CFTC study was an outgrowth of last year's undercover
investigation of trading at the two Chicago exchanges that resulted
in scores of indictments.

<HEAD>Administration Says Records Set In New Investigations, Recalls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER}</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government opened a record number of
investigations of possible automobile safety defects in 1989, the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said.
   The agency said Thursday it had begun 213 defect investigations
last year, the most in its 20-year`history.
   Additionally, the agency said it`influenced a record 77 percent
of the recalls ordered in 1989. A total of 6.7 million vehicles
were recalled for safety problems.
   ``An aggressive safety`defects program is essential to our
safety mission,'' said Jerry R. Curry, administrator of the agency.
   But the Center for Auto Safety, a group founded by consumer
advocate Ralph Nader, accused the agency of reporting meaningless
statistics to mask poor performance.
   ``Those are phony numbers,'' said Clarence Ditlow, the center's
executive director. ``What they're doing is creating a smokescreen
to conceal from the public that they're not enforcing the mandatory
recall law.''
   The center repeatedly has complained that under the Reagan
administration, the agency abandoned investigations that should
have produced recalls. The agency said it pursued recalls when
needed but discontinued probes when it was plain there was no
widespread safety problem.
   Ditlow said the agency should not boast of influencing the
highest percentage of recalls ever when the number of recalls was
well below those of the late 1970s.
   Jeffrey Miller, deputy administrator of the agency, said
Ditlow's comments were ``patent nonsense.''
   Miller acknowledged that recalls rose in the late 1970s and fell
in the early 1980s, but said both trends were largely the result of
tire problems that were corrected. There was a steady`upward trend
in recalls in the late 1980s, he said.
   ``We have an active, robust investigation which takes consumer
complaints very seriously and looks at them and evaluates them all
fairly,'' Miller said.
   Recalls ordered last year, Curry said, included 1.7 million
General Motors vehicles to correct sticking throttles, 1.4 million
Ford Escorts`to fix a problem with the driver's seat, and 650,000
Chrysler vehicles and 481,000 Escorts to prevent engine oil leaks.
   Also recalled were 500,000 Chrysler vehicles to fix
front-suspension corrosion and 408,000 Toyota Camrys to repair
jamming safety belts.

<HEAD>EPA Proposes Gasoline Evaporation Regulations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency has
proposed regulations to reduce hydrocarbon releases from cars and
trucks when gasoline evaporates.
   Proposed changes in how vehicle emission tests are to be run
would require automakers to modify vehicle emission control
equipment in a way that atmospheric hydrocarbon levles would fall
about 5 percent, the agency said Thursday.
   The modifications are said to be minor and should add only about
$10 to the cost of a car, an amount that would be more than offset
by better fuel economy, according to the EPA.
   Hydrocarbons, or volatile organic compounds, released from motor
vehicles react with the sun to form ozone. When also combined with
particulates in the air, the result is the smog that plagues many
of the nation's urban centers.
   The regulatory proposal announced Thursday applies only to
hydrocarbon releases from the normal evaporation of gasoline,
especially`in hot weather, both when a vehicle is running and when
it is idle.
   The proposal would require emissions testing procedures to be
changed to assure that such evaporated fuel losses are better
controlled, especially during summer driving and after a vehicle
has been idle for a day or more.
   In some cases, automakers are expected to equip vehicles with
larger charcoal cannisters so emission control systems are not
overloaded by gasoline vapors or make other changes to improve the
system's ability to purge such vapors when a car is running,
officials said.
   The new requirements, when made final later this year, will
apply to all gasoline-fueled passenger cars and trucks.

<HEAD>Administration Rejected Recycling Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration considered but
rejected the idea of proposing new taxes on various materials in an
effort to encourage recycling, an administration official said.
   The official, who spoke Thursday on condition that he not be
named, said the proposal had been given a good chance of becoming
part of the president's fiscal 1991 budget request to Congress but
that it was finally rejected by the Office of Management and Budget.
   OMB Director Richard Darman stripped the proposed tax _ along
with other so-called ``user fees'' _ to avoid charges from
congressional Democrats that President`Bush was violating his
no-new-taxes pledge, the official said.
   The proposal would have imposed new taxes on paper, glass,
plastic and metals that were not recycled. The Environmental
Protection Agency, which favored the tax concept as a way of
encouraging greater use of recycled materials by U.S. industry,
wants to reduce the nation's output of waste by 25 percent`by 1992.
   Bush, as part of his 1988 presidential campaign, promised to
``make a national commitment to reduce waste by recycling and
developing technology that produces less waste.''
   By making products`made from virgin materials more expensive,
supporters of the tax had argued it would encourage businesses to
use more recycled materials.
   Another revenue raiser rejected by the administration in recent
days would have imposed a sales tax on off-road vehicles, camping
equipment, motor homes and pleasure boats.
   Supporters of that rejected proposal wanted to have the new
revenue earmarked for specific recreation and conservation programs
on federal lands, but it, too, fell victim to Darman's concern that
critics would charge the president with violating his pledge
against new taxes.
   The various decisions on spending and taxes are being made as
the administration puts the finishing touches on a proposed $1.23
trillion budget for the fiscal year beginning next October. The
budget will be sent to Congress on Jan. 29.

<HEAD>Mutual Funds In '89: Bad Year For `Junk,' Good For Biotech, Growth
Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For mutual fund investors, 1989 was a banner
year for biotechnology and growth companies but a waste of time
when it came to many bonds.
   A tally of the best- and worst-performing mutual funds released
today by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. says the Alger Small
Capital fund scored last year's biggest gain, 65.08 percent.
   The fund made money through a strategy of picking small
companies that showed potential for rapid growth.
   In the cellar was Strategic Gold-Minerals, with a 17.75 percent
loss due largely to its investments in coal mines that went sour,
although most funds specializing in gold performed well for the
year.
   Many of last year's losers were concentrated in fixed-income
investments, particularly in high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, or
in the world income category, which includes funds in overseas
bonds denominated by fluctuating currencies.
   Among junk bond funds are the Dean Witter High Yield fund, which
declined 13.64 percent; Alliance Bond: High Fund, down 12.94
percent; and American Capital High Yield, down 12.04 percent.
   Performance figures in Lipper's rankings of 1,683 continuing
funds for 1989 assume that investors reinvest all dividends`and
capital gains distributions paid by the funds.
   A. Michael Lipper, the firm's president, said 1989 was a
surprisingly good year for stock funds even though the economyM
muddled along.
   ``You had a nice recovery in 1988 (after the 1987 stock market
crash), but you developed real strength in 1989 that was`somewhat
surprising,'' Lipper said in an interview Thursday. ``If the gains
had been half of what they were a number of people probably would
have been happy.''
   Equity fund gains averaged nearly 24 percent last year, compared
with 9.42 percent for fixed-income funds. Stocks also did well for
the entire decade, with equity funds gaining an average 322 percent.
   Although a number of individual funds sustained losses in 1989,
all of the 22 fund categories had a positive overall performance
for the year, with an average gain of 18.48 percent, according to
Lipper.
   But the gap between the top and bottom performers was wide.
   Health and biotechnology funds were the leaders of 1989 with
average gains of 43.5 percent, while world income funds eked out a
6.02 percent average gain.
   Lipper said the biotechnology and health industry was ``an area
that continues to grow at a much faster rate than the rest of the
economy.''
   ``We've seen some mergers and new drugs during 1989. It's a
worldwide business,'' he said.
   Rounding out the top five mutual funds were: natural resources
funds, up 32.13 percent; utility funds, 28.96 percent; growth
funds, 25.44 percent; and capital appreciation funds, 23.81 percent.
   Among the bottom five, fixed income funds, including junk bond
funds, gained an average 9.42 percent; option income funds, 12.45
percent; and convertible securities funds and mixed income funds,
each up 13.84 percent.
   By comparison, the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip
stocks had a rate of return of 31.64 percent and the S&amp;P 500 index
had a rate of return of 32.24 percent for the year, assuming
dividend reinvestment.

<HEAD>Lawyers Seek To Block New Allegations in Freeman Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for admitted inside trader Robert
Freeman are seeking to block the government from making public a
sentencing recommendation that alleges a series of new and unproven
fraudulent transactions.
   The government also names several individuals`in the memo who
allegedly lied during the 2{-year grand jury investigation of the
Freeman case, according to documents filed in Manhattan federal
court.
   The dispute hinges on the disclosure of sensitive grand jury
matters and has delayed sentencing of the former head of arbitrage
at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., arrested in 1987 in a highly publicized
case that later fell flat.
   The government contends that releasing the memo shows`a broad
range of questionable conduct by Freeman that should be considered
in sentencing. Freeman has admitted to one instance of insider
trading.
   ``In connection with his sentencing, Freeman loudly contends
that this was the only occasion in which he engaged in insider
trading,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney John McEnany wrote. ``The
government has evidence to the contrary which it believes the court
should consider ...''
   The issue marks another twist in a case that began with the
touted February 1987 arrests of Freeman and two others based on
information linked to jailed inside trader Ivan Boesky.
   Government prosecutors boasted that initial charges were ``the
tip of the iceberg.'' But the indictments later were dropped and
prosecutors last year abandoned an investigation of the two other
Wall Street traders, Timothy Tabor and Richard Wigton. Wigton even
was handcuffed after his arrest.
   The case now is widely viewed as the government's biggest
embarrassment in the three-year insider trading investigation begun
by former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani.
   In a draft of the sentencing memo given to defense lawyers,
prosecutors allege a series of insider trading transactions beyond
the one Freeman admitted, attorneys Paul Curran and Robert B. Fiske
state in court documents.
   The sentencing report has not been filed, pending a ruling by
U.S. District Judge Pierre Leval on whether it should be kept under
seal or allowed into the public record.
   ``The government's allegations are false and they unfairly
implicate not only Mr. Freeman but also other persons, none of whom
has been charged with respect to these allegations,'' Curran and
Fiske state in a motion seeking to seal the memo.
   The government and The Wall Street Journal have filed papers
arguing that the sentencing document should be released.
   Freeman pleaded guilty last August to one count of mail fraud
for using inside information in January 1986 to trade in connection
with the proposed takeover of Beatrice Cos. by the investment firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   He admitted receiving the information from former Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co. investment banker Martin A. Siegel, who has pleaded
guilty to two counts and is awaiting sentencing.
   Freeman's lawyers contend that`only material dealing with the
Beatrice transaction should be made public.
   ``Freeman is someone who cares about his reputation. If he is
seen as someone who has been trading with the abandon of an Ivan
Boesky, he'll be unemployable,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a
Columbia University securities law professor.
   In court papers filed last month, attorneys for Freeman charge
that the sentencing report will ``tarnish Mrn Freeman's already
scarred reputation and cause serious injury to the reputation of
others.''
   ``Some individuals are branded as liars. Still others are
accused of insider trading,'' the lawyers state. ``The stigma that
the publication of such accusations would impose is irrevocable
...''
   The sentencing memo reportedly cites about a dozen instances of
uncharged insider trading by Freeman, including two named in his
original indictment, and includes the names of some who testified
before the grand jury.
   Under existing case law, grand jury secrecy protects defendants
from disclosure of accusations that are not contained in an
indictment returned by the panel, which determines whether or what
criminal charges can be filed.
   In the Freeman case, the government acknowledges that a
``significant portion'' of the memo relies on grand jury matters
but that no testimony is directly quoted and the information is
merely summarized.
   McEnany stated the government agreed only not to prosecute
Freeman for other matters uncovered in its investigation. The
Supreme Court has allowed sentencing judges to consider alleged
conduct that a defendant has not been convicted of or admitted to.
   Freeman faces a maximum five years in prison and up to $1.9
million in fines.

   The dollar was mixed in European trading this
morning as speculators retreated in the face of central bank
interventions.
   Gold was higher.
   Currency traders in Milan said any speculative initiatives had
been quashed by central bank intervention, particularly moves by
the West German Bundesbank on Thursday.
   ``The market is walking very cautiously, stepping gingerly, like
the Pink Panther,'' said one trader in Milan.
   News that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev had canceled
meetings with foreign visitors to concentrate on domestic problems
sent Japan's stock exchange into a skid and halted a rapid drop in
the dollar's value against the yen.
   Naoki Kiyohara, chief of currency options at Fuji Bank, said the
Bank of Japan intervened several times in the afternoon in an
attempt to drive the dollar below 144 yen, but the news about
Gorbachev was the most influential factor in weakening the currency.
   The dollar finished the day in Tokyo at 144.15 yen, down 1.05
yen from Thursday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 144.06 yen.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6234 from $1.6290 late
Thursday.
   Other mid-morning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.6880 West German marks, up from
1.6825; 1.5438 Swiss francs, down from 1.5722; 5.7556 French
francs, up from 5.7500; 1.9058 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9275;
1,267.00 Italian lire, up from 1,265.25; and 1.1600 Canadian
dollars, unchanged.
   London's gold dealers fixed a recommended price of $401.20 an
ounce this morning, up from Thursday's late bid price of $395.00.
   In Zurich, the metal rose to a bid of $401.00, from $395.70 bid
late Thursday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose the equivalent of $6.03 an ounce today,
to close at $400.92.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $5.28 a troy

<HEAD>Japan's Asahi Breweries To Produce Beer In U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Asahi Breweries Ltd., the third largest beer
producer in Japan, announced Friday the company plans to build a
plant in the United States and produce its ``Super Dry'' beer, one
of the company's largest exports.
   Asahi is planning to invest about 10 billion yen, or about $70
million at Friday's exchange rate, to build a plant near Denver,
Colo., in April, aiming to complete it by the end of 1991, said a
company official who declined to be named, in accordance with
Japanese practice.
   The company currently exports ``Super Dry'' through its wholly
owned subsidiary Asahi Breweries U.S.A., Inc.
   The product sold about 4,300 kiloliters in the United States in
1989. Overall U.S. beer consumption was 1.3 billion kiloliters to
1.4 billion kiloliters last year, the official said. One kiloliter
is equal to 264 gallons.
   The company expects sales of the beer to increase in the future,
the official said.
   The new plant will be capable of producing up to 12,700
kiloliters a year, which is about 10 percent of the amount
currently produced at the company's plant in Japan. Asahi plans to
increase the capacity of the U.S. plant five times within three
years of completion of construction, the official said.
   The beer initially will be marketed mainly in California, and
later in other states, Asahi said.

   The nation's unemployment rate held steady at
5.3 percent in December, ending 1989 at about where it began,
despite weaker-than-average job growth in the final month of the
year, the government said today.
   The civilian jobless rate as measured by a household survey by
the Labor Department was unchanged despite the gain of 142,000 jobs
in December, a figure artificially bolstered by the return of
55,000 striking telephone workers in New York.
   The survey of employers, from which the job growth figure is
derived, is often considered a more reliable indicator of economic
developments by analysts.
   The unemployment rate began 1989 at 5.4 percent in January and
since then has fluctuated in a narrow range within a tenth of a
percentage point of 5.3 percent, except for March when it dipped to
a 15-year low of 5 percent. The average for the year was 5.3
percent.
   ``In fact, the jobless rate remained markedly stable during the
whole year of 1989,'' Janet L. Norwood, commissioner of labor
statistics, noted.
   Last month, the Labor Department said the November unemployment
rate was 5.4 percent, but today it revised that figure down to 5.3
percent.
   The unemployment stall in 1989 was due primarily to a slowdown
in the manufacturing sector, which lost 25,000 jobs in December,
bringing job losses since March to 195,000.
   Overall job growth during the last six months of the year
averaged around 160,000 a month, down sharply from the average
270,000 monthly gain during the previous 2{ years.
   The economy, according to the household survey, produced 1.7
million new jobs during 1989, bringing the civilian workforce to
117.9 million. That was down from job gains of 2.3 million in 1988.
   Economist Michael K. Evans, who heads a consulting firm in
Washington, said the unemployment rate has remained stable because
the total available labor force has been growing more slowly at the
same time fewer new jobs are becoming available.
   ``Things are in balance. It's a pretty healthy situation,'' he
said.
   More manufacturing layoffs are expected. Automakers have already
announced plant shutdowns this month.
   The average manufacturing work week held steady in December at
40.7 hours, as did overtime at 3.7 hours.
   Construction employers reported a seasonally adjusted 38,000
fewer jobs in December than a month earlier. Analysts are
attributing the drop to the deep freeze that gripped most of the
nation last month.
   In contrast, service-producing industries continued to
demonstrate healthy gains, adding 206,000 jobs to bring growth for
the year to 2.4 million.
   Transportation employers added 73,000 jobs on a seasonally
adjusted basis last month. Business services added 14,000, health
services, 47,000; government, 34,000; and finance, insurance and
real estate, 13,000. Retail employment grew by 12,000 fewer jobs
than the normally expected seasonal gain.
   Mining industries, which includes oil drilling, lost 1,000 jobs.
   Average hourly earnings posted a 0.6 percent rise in December to
$9.84, bringing the gain for the year to 4.1 percent. That wasn't
enough to keep up with consumer price inflation, which has been
running at about 4.5 percent.
   The unemployment rates among major demographic groups last month
were:
   _Adult white men, 3.9 percent, the same as in November.
   _Adult white women, 4.1 percent, up from 4.0 percent.
   _White teen-agers, 13.0 percent, up from 12.9 percent.
   _All blacks, 11.8 percent, down from 11.9 percent.
   _Adult black men, 10.8 percent, up from 10.6 percent.
   _Adult black women, 10.0 percent, down from 10.2 percent.
   _Black teen-agers, 30.7 percent, down from 32.5 percent.
   _Hispanics, 8.5 percent, up from 8.0 percent.
   In a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of
the armed services stationed in the United States, the December
jobless rate was 5.3 percent, the same as November. The rates were
also the same as the civilian rate.

<TEXT>
   A crippled Iranian tanker that spilled 19
million gallons of oil off the Moroccan coast was turned away today
by Portugal, the third country to refuse entry to the ship.
   A Portuguese navy patrol boat escorted the Khark 5 away from the
Portuguese island of Madeira after the tanker entered its
territorial waters there, the national news agency Lusa said today.
   The salvage company Smit Tak, which is commanding the three tugs
towing the Khark 5, said it planned to take the tanker to the Cape
Verde islands, through more than 1,200 miles of open seas. Cape
Verde is a former Portuguese colony off the West African coast.
   Smit Tak has been trying to find a safe haven for the Khark 5
since an explosion ripped through the ship's hull Dec. 19 when it
was 400 miles north of Las Palmas in Spain's Canary Islands.
   Morocco, 400 miles west, refused to let the tanker dock there,
and a 100-square-mile oil slick threatened Morocco's coastline.
Pollution experts said Thursday nearly all the oil had dissipated
and that there was no danger of an environmental disaster.
   At a weekly Cabinet meeting today, the Spanish government
confirmed an earlier decision to deny a request to tow the
1,837-foot tanker to sheltered waters off the southern coast of
Tenerife in the Canary Islands.
   Smit Tak said the tanker is no longer leaking oil, but it wants
to find a sheltered spot so it can unload the remaining 53 million
gallons of crude oil and perform emergency repairs.
   ``The essential thing is that the remaining oil be transferred
in the high seas to another ship,'' said Spanish government
spokeswoman Rosa Conde after today's Cabinet meeting.
   The government has offered all help ``within its power'' to the
stricken ship as long as it remains outside Spanish waters, she
said.
   On Thursday, environmental experts said more than 90 percent of
the oil that spilled into the sea had either evaporated, dissolved
in the sea, been broken up in high waves or been dispersed by
chemicals sprayed on the water to fight the slick.
   The edge of the oil slick was 20 miles off the Moroccan oyster
farming town of Oualidyia on Thursday, and sailors laid floating
barriers to stop its advance.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said Thursday that a
storm ripped a hole in one of the tanker's storage tanks, causing
the explosion that started the leak.
   Aqazadeh said reports of environmental damage caused by the
spill were exaggerated and that the ship met all safety
specifications.
   The vessel, built in 1975, was damaged at least three times in
Iraqi air strikes in the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq war. The
normal life span of a tanker of its size is 15 to 20 years.

<HEAD>Diet Coke Unveils 1990 Advertising Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Celebrity consumers say ``goodbye'' to Pepsi Cola
in Diet Coke television commercials for 1990 unveiled by the
Coca-Cola Co.
   Pepsi spokesman Tod MacKenzie immediately branded the tactic of
comparing the sugared Pepsi and the sugar-free diet Coke ``a feeble
attempt to get the playing field changed.''
   The 1990 Diet Coke advertising campaign unveiled Thursday
features model Jerry Hall, tennis star Chris Evert, ``Cosby Show''
actress Phylicia Rashad and TV personality Vanna White in 30-second
commercials.
   The theme is an extension of last year's ``The Move Is On''
campaign, which was designed to draw drinkers of Pepsi, the No. 2
soft drink behind Coca-Cola, to No. 3 Diet Coke.
   According to Beverage Digest, an industry publication, Pepsi
last year had 18.3 percent market share in the nation, while Diet
Coke was third at 8.9 percent. But Diet Coke's share of the market
rose 0.7 percent _ the biggest jump by any in the Beverage Digest
Top 10 _ while Pepsi declined 0.4 percent, the biggest drop and an
apparent reflection of the overall increasing popularity of diet
drinks.
   Pepsi's diet drink, fourth-ranked Diet Pepsi, also had a healthy
gain _ 0.5 percent _ to claim 5.7 percent of the market.
   MacKenzie, from Pepsi's Purchase, N.Y., headquarters, said he
hadn't seen the new Diet Coke ads but noted that Diet Pepsi
launched a new campaign featuring comedian Billy Crystal last week.
   ``Rest assured, we've got a pool of spots we're going to bring
out to take the wood to Diet Coke,'' he said.

   London share prices were steady at lower levels at
midday Friday, after recovering from early falls induced by Tokyo's
earlier stumble.
   At about noon London time, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was down 10 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,441.6.
   Traders said the index slumped by around 15 points in pre-market
trading, but lack of follow-through selling inspired the market to
perk up.
   At its best, the index touched a morning peak of 2,448.7 points,
before once again moving lower.
   ``The market is very nervous and isn't quite sure which
direction to go in,'' one dealer said.
   Volume amounted to 277 million shares by midday, compared with
407.5 million shares at the same time Thursday.
   Dealers said that many investors were reluctant to get into
large deals ahead of the release of U.S. unemployment figures for
December early Friday.
   Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 selected issues closed down 438.12
points at 38,274.76 earlier Friday on news that Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has canceled all his January foreign
engagements to concentrate on domestic troubles.
   ``The market hates political uncertainty,'' one dealer said.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today went
into their worst plunge since Oct. 16 on reports Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev canceled all foreign engagements to deal with
domestic unrest.
   The news braked a rapid fall in the value of the U.S. dollar
against the yen. The dollar finished the day at 144.15 yen, down
1.05 yen from Thursday's close.
   The Hong Kong Stock Exchange also closed sharply lower, with the
Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips, falling
28.01 points to 2,839.94. Brokers attributed the losses to the news
reports and to the drop on the Tokyo market.
   News reports that Gorbachev canceled a meeting with British
Labor Party leaders in Moscow and postponed all other contacts with
foreign politicians hit the Tokyo market in early afternoon
trading, sending the 225-issue Nikkei average into a tailspin. The
leading market indicator closed at 38,274.76, down 438.12 points,
or 1.1 percent, from the day before.
   It was the largest single-day loss on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
since a 647-point plunge on Oct. 16. Within the last hour of
trading, the decline had approached 600 points, but late buying cut
the loss.
   ``To Japan, the worst thing that could happen to the world
scenario would be for Gorbachev to drop from sight,'' said Chris
Schreiber, an investment analyst with New Japan Securities.
   Gorbachev is regarded in Japan as the key to global stability,
he said.
   ``Trading houses were hard-hit today because they had been
recommended by brokers on the detente theme,'' Schreiber said,
citing a 5 percent loss for Marubeni and an even larger drop for C.
Itoh and Co.
   But he added that the market was already ``very touchy'' in view
of difficulties that may lie ahead for the governing Liberal
Democratic Party following Lower House elections expected on Feb.
18.
   ``The current market perception is that (the LDP) is going to
just hold on to a majority,'' he said, but added that governing
with a slimmer majority is expected to be difficult for the party.
   Schreiber also attributed the drop to traders' expectations of a
``speed correction'' following several months of rapid gains on the
Tokyo market.
   The dollar, having opened sharply down at 143.40 yen, climbed
during the morning to 143.65 yen.
   The dollar continued rising in the afternoon despite
intervention by the Bank of Japan.
   During the day's trading, the dollar moved between 143.35-144.18
yen.
   Naoki Kiyohara, chief of currency options at Fuji Bank,
attributed the dollar's rise from its morning level to the news
about Gorbachev, together with a trading-floor rumor that Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu was canceling his scheduled trip to Eastern
Europe. The rumor was denied by the Foreign Ministry, but Kiyohara
said its effect was already felt in the market.
   Kiyohara said the Bank of Japan intervened several times in the
afternoon in an attempt to drive the dollar below 144 yen, but
although ``many dealers were wary of intervention...the news about
Gorbachev was the most influential factor.''

<HEAD>Latest Bull-Market Mania: Country Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock-market investors have wasted no time
lately speculating on the potential benefits of growing
international trade in an increasingly democratic world.
   In recent weeks they have scrambled to buy shares of ``country
funds'' investing in corners of the globe ranging from Germany to
Chile to Thailand.
   As Wall Street closed the books on 1989, these funds clearly
stamped themselves as the latest in a long line of hot financial
properties that helped keep the bull market bubbling throughout the
'80s.
   Among the 42 issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange that
doubled or more in price during 1989, no less than eight were
closed-end investment companies specializing in securities of a
single country or region of the world.
   Spain Fund, which almost tripled; Asia Pacific Fund; Thai Fund,
and the Germany Fund all made the Top Ten.
   World events provided several sparks to keep enthusiasm for
these stocks going. The most obvious was the toppling of economic
and political barriers in eastern Europe after decades in the
shadow of communism.
   The apparent end to the Cold War raised visions of vast new
opportunities for the economies of western Europe, which had
already begun to gear up for business and financial alliances set
to take effect in 1992.
   Heiko Thieme, investment strategist for Deutsche Bank Capital
Corp. in New York, projects that the opening up of eastern Europe
will in time raise the world's total economic output by a full
percentage point.
   Meanwhile, investors searched frenetically elsewhere in the
world for upwardly mobile nations that might be ready to follow in
the footsteps of such modern success stories as Japan.
   Even if that reasoning were as good as it sounded, however, many
analysts who have watched the mania develop say buyers of country
funds seem to be willing to pay almost any price to satisfy their
appetites.
   Nearly all the country funds are closed-end investment
companies. They operate in much the same manner as mutual funds,
except that their sponsors do not continuously buy and sell shares
at the prevailing net asset value.
   Instead, the funds have a fixed number of shares that trade on
stock exchanges or in the over-the-counter market, just like other
common stocks. So the price they command is determined by market
forces, and can fluctuate above (at a ``premium'' to) or below (at
a ``discount'' to) the net asset value.
   Some country funds, notably in the Far East, have traded at
premiums almost all of the time since their inception, in part
because foreigners have few or no other ways to participate in
those countries' markets.
   Lately, however, other country funds in Europe and elsewhere
that once traded at discounts also have soared past the per-share
value of the investments they own.
   ``In recent months the share prices of single country closed-end
funds have been bid up to unrealistic prices,'' asserts Norman
Tepper, an analyst at the Value Line Investment Survey, in the
advisory service's latest appraisal of the group.
   However bright the funds' long-term prospects, ``most major
world economies are either experiencing inflation, rising interest
rates or stagflation,'' Tepper says. ``Most will probably show
slower economic growth in 1990. Several stock markets look rather
perilous.''
   As has been demonstrated in the past, a popular closed-end fund
can keep trading at lofty premiums for a long time. But analysts
point out that a big premium in a fund is like a high
price-earnings ratio for an industrial stock, suggesting that
expectations of many good things are already built into the price.
   Securities in that position are considered vulnerable to any
disappointment that might arise from, say, greater weakness than
expected in the pace of the world economy.
   In Tepper's view, the present circumstances ``certainly suggest
that investors exercise caution with respect to foreign
investments, and in particular closed-end funds with stakes in
overseas-based companies.''

   Stock prices fell today in an atmosphere of
uneasiness over the economic outlook and political developments in
the Soviet Union.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 16.86 to
2,779.22 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in the early
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 311 up, 715
down and 435 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.39 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment
rate held steady at 5.3 percent in December. The data showed a
smaller-than-expected 142,000 increase in nonfarm payroll
employment.
   Traders in the bond market took that as favorable news,
suggesting that the pace of the economy remained sluggish enough to
allow the Federal Reserve to consider further moves toward easier
credit.
   But stock-market investors evidently read the figures as a sign

<HEAD>Most Economists Say Interest Rates Headed Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Short-term interest rates should drop in the
coming months as the Federal Reserve Board eases monetary policy
further to forestall a recession, most economists believe.
   Declining interest rates are good news to bondholders since it
means the value, or price, of their fixed-return investments should
increase.
   The Fed has been easing interest rates since the middle of last
year, when it became apparent that the economy was slowing. The
policy is consistent with the Fed's aim of a ``soft landing'' for
the economy, which is in the eighth year of a record-breaking
expansion.
   David M. Blitzer, chief economist at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., is
among the more pessimistic observers of the health of the economy.
   ``The U.S. is teetering on the edge of recession,'' he wrote
last week in a commentary.
   He said that unless the Fed eases rates further, the economy
will fall over that cliff.
   ``Interest rates for 1990 are relatively easy to forecast,''
Blitzer said. ``Either the Fed will ease and rates will come down
now, or it will not ease, there will be a recession, and rates will
come down later.''
   Barclays de Zoete Wedd Government Securities Inc. predicts the
government will report in late January a 1 percent decline in
fourth-quarter real gross national product. That decline, the
investment house projects, will prompt the Fed to lower its
discount rate for the first time since the central bank has been
headed by Alan Greenspan, who took charge in the summer of 1987.
   The discount rate, currently 7 percent, is the interest the Fed
charges member banks for loans, and it provides a floor for other
interest rates, such as bank loan rates.
   Previously, the Fed has worked to lower general interest rates
by easing the federal funds rate, the rate banks charge on
overnight loans to each other. However, the financial consulting
firm Griggs &amp; Santow Inc. cautions that while the GNP figure is an
important gauge of the economy, the fourth-quarter figure may be
distorted by the hurricanes, the California earthquake and strikes
during the three months.
   ``Moreover, a quite weak GNP number can occur even as important
areas of the economy are doing well,'' the firm says. ``Thus, even
though GNP will be weak in the fourth quarter, the consumer,
energy, export, investment and non-defense spending sectors are all
likely to expand.''
   Other experts are less certain of continued Fed easing as long
as core inflation remains at about 4.5 percent. Recent weather- and
accident-related increases in the prices of crude oil, orange juice
and other commodities fuel this belief. In addition, some
economists say not all signs point to a recession.
   ``Barring either a severe financial disruption or the imminence
of recession, we foresee no quick exit from a still-tight monetary
policy,'' John Lonski, senior economist for Moody's Investors
Service Inc., wrote recently. ``Without pressing reasons to do
otherwise, the danger of higher inflation may have to pass before
the Fed relaxes its firm monetary grip.''
   Many analysts say the predicted drop in interest rates will
occur almost entirely among short-term bonds. Yields on long-term
issues, such as the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, should
remain steady.
   Currently, the 30-year bond is trading at about 8percent. The
belief is that the yield will not decline due to the need to
attract overseas investors in the bonds, which help finance the
federal deficit. Interest rates in West Germany and Japan have been
rising, increasing the competition for global investors' funds.
   In addition, the rate may remain at its current level due to the
4.5 percent core inflation, which cuts the actual yield by more
than half, analysts say. This factor may limit any drop in
short-term yields as well, as bond investors continue to demand
compensation for inflation.
   With short term rates dropping more than long-term issues, the
Treasury yield curve, which plots the yield of Treasury securities
along a line measuring their maturity, will steepen further in a
positive direction. This means investors will be rewarded ever more
for tying up their money in longer-term bonds.

<HEAD>Bond Corp. Of Australia Wins In One Court, Still Faces Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PERTH, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. won a reprieve
Friday as the Western Australian Supreme Court dismissed a
government petition to liquidate the media, brewing, natural
resources and property empire.
   The court ruled against the State Government Insurance
Commission, which had asked the court to appoint a provisional
liquidator for Bond Corp. on the grounds that the company
controlled by financier Alan Bond was insolvent.
   A judge ruled that the insurance commission had failed to prove
its claim.
   ``There is no evidence that the creditors of (Bond Corp.) aren't
being paid,'' the judge said.
   The future of Bond Corp. may be uncertain, the judge said, but a
petition should not be filed on speculation ``that a company may
possibly at some time in the future experience severe financial
difficulties.''
   He also ruled that a nearly $668,000 debt that was the basis of
the petition was disputed by Bond Corp.
   While Bond Corp. succeeded on one front, the company, whose
debts total $5.6 billion, was still battling in another court to
overturn an order to appoint receivers and managers to its
Australian brewing units.
   The company is also trying to negotiate with U.S. holders of
debentures issued by its Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd. unit who have
demanded immediate repayment of $510 million of the securities and
overdue inerest.
   Lawyers for the debenture holders said in court here Friday they
intend to support continuation of receivers appointed last month to
operate Bond's brewing units.
   The court appointed the receivers at the request of a syndicate
of international banks led by National Australia Bank Ltd.
   U.S. noteholders were due to receive a $32.19 million interest
payment from Bond's brewing arm, but the courts froze that payment
at the request of the bank syndicate. Bond Brewing has asked the
court to lift the bank's stop-payment notice.
   Alan Bond, who controls about 58 percent of Bond Corp., gained
virtual hero status in Australia when he won the 1983 America's Cup
yachting trophy. The millionaire industrialist has been selling
assets in recent months to reduce debt.
   In its fiscal year ended June 30, Bond Corp. lost 980.2 million
Australian dollars, the largest annual loss in Australian corporate
history.
   Bond Corp.'s G. Heileman Brewing Co. unit in the United States
so far is not involved in the receivership proceedings.
   Heileman spokesman Bill Eiler said in a telephone interview from
Pittsburgh Thursday the U.S. brewer has separate financing from
Bond Corp. and as a matter of policy does not comment on matters
involving Bond.
   Bond purchased La Crosse, Wis.-based Heileman in 1987 for about
$1.3 billion and reportedly still owes about $850 million after
selling the profitable Heileman Baking Co. and other Heileman
subsidiaries.
   Heileman officials said recently they have been meeting with
creditors and reviewing alternatives ``aimed at favorably modifying
Heileman's existing debt structure.''
   Separately, Adolph Coors Co., the fourth-largest U.S. brewing
company, acknowledged this week it has held talks with Heileman for
over a year about the possible purchase of the Wisconsin brewer.

   Cold weather in the United States will pinch
motorists in Britain, where gasoline prices are going up by 5.5
pence, or about 9 cents per imperial gallon.
   Esso announced on Friday that it was raising its price on
top-grade leaded gasoline, and other companies were expected to
follow suit.
   The increase raised the price of gasoline to the equivalent of
$2.13 per U.S. gallon, or 41.5 pence per liter. An imperial gallon
is the equivalent of about 1 and one-fifth U.S. gallons.
   Esso said one factor in the price increase was the cold weather
in the United States, which has driven up prices of gas oils by 60
percent on the Rotterdam spot market.

<TEXT>
   Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.,
the central figure in a $2 billion savings and loan scandal,
acknowledged today that bookkeeping by his thrift institution hid
the true buyer in a major real estate deal.
   But, Keating, chairman of American Continental Corp., parent
company of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.,
said the bookkeeping was a proper part of a land syndication deal
and that government examiners should not have cared about the
identity of the true buyer.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin, who is hearing evidence in
Keating's suit to overturn the government seizure of Lincoln last
April, reacted skeptically, asking: ``How is it you can manage
billion-dollar businesses and have transactions where the paperwork
did not reflect what took place?''
   ``When you run a bank or a savings and loan, you have the
highest responsibility of anyone because you're not dealing just
with stockholders, you're dealing with people's savings,'' Sporkin
told Keating. ``... The only way regulators (can ensure that an
institution is being run properly) is if the books and records
accurately reflect transactions.''
   In 1987, Lincoln sold 1,000 acres, for which it had paid $3
million, to WestContinental Mortgage Co. for $14 million. However,
government regulators maintain that WestContinental was just a
straw buyer for Arizona developer and stockbroker Ernest C. Garcia.
They say the land transaction was improperly linked with another
transaction between Lincoln and Garcia on the same day.
   Keating told the judge, ``I can't believe that anyone was
innocent of the fact that the deal was being made with Garcia.
Everybody who was there and present at that time, including the
(government) examiners, knew what we were doing.''
   However, in response to a later question from his own attorney,
Keating acknowledged that he did not know whether his own auditors
knew that Garcia was the buyer.
   And, Kevin O'Connell, a supervisory official with the federal
Office of Thrift Supervision, told reporters after Keating's
testimony: ``There is nothing in the record that we were ever
advised that Garcia was the real buyer.''
   On Thursday, Keating broke his self-imposed silence with more
than an hour of testimony in which he described how he used Lincoln
to finance massive residential projects in the Phoenix area.
   Keating has had little to say in public since September, when
government regulators filed a $1.1 billion fraud and racketeering
civil suit charging he operated Lincoln for his own and his
family's benefit. A grand jury in Los Angeles is examining possible
criminal charges against Keating.
   The government seized Lincoln in April, claiming it was
operating in an unsafe and unsound manner.
   In November, Keating asserted his constitutional protection
against self-incrimination and refused to testify before a House
committee investigating the failure.
   But Keating sought the court action and, in response to the
judge's questions, he readily described his disappointment when the
seizure of Lincoln blocked the completion of a large residential
project west of Phoenix.
   ``The saddest thing in my life is that we were brought to this
pass,'' he said.
   Keating also is at the center of a Senate Ethics Committee
investigation, examining the actions of five senators who accepted
more than $1.3 million in contributions from the financier and
later met on his behalf with federal regulators.
   In Thursday's hearing, government investigators focused on a
stock transaction with Garcia which denied up to $12 million in
profits to a Lincoln subsidiary and instead benefited American
Continental, which provided Keating and his family with millions of
dollars in salaries and benefits.
   The Lincoln subsidiary sold $1 million of Memorex common stock
to Garcia. The subsidiary retained an option to repurchase the
shares for $4.25 million, should their value skyrocket.
   Four months later, in late October 1987, American Continental
repurchased the stock from Garcia for $2 million and the
subsidiary, headed by Keating's son, Charles H. Keating III, waived
its option.
   Later, in March and April 1988, American Continental sold the
stock for $13.3 million. Because it waived its option, the Lincoln
subsidiary didn't get any of the profits, which would have offset
taxpayer losses in the S&amp;L's later failure.
   The Memorex transaction is one of four deals the government has
cited as examples of ``unsafe and unsound'' practices that
justified its takeover of Lincoln.
   The elder Keating testified he approved the decision for
American Continental to buy back the Memorex stock from Garcia.
But, he said, ``I don't believe that I made the decision where to
put it. I don't know who made the decision on waiving the
(Lincoln's buyback) option.''
   He said he assumed that was done because federal S&amp;L regulators
were pressing Lincoln to get out of stock market investments.
   However, Sporkin said, ``I can't see the regulators objecting''
to retaining the Memorex option, which could only benefit Lincoln.

<HEAD>New Charges Returned Against Former USX Official</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury has added three
charges against a former USX Corp. official in an investigation of
pensions the company awarded to union negotiators in 1983.
   James Bruce Johnston, indicted on one felony count last month,
now faces four charges and may stand trial with USX and two
Birmingham union leaders in March.
   Johnston said in a statement that the new indictment, returned
Thursday and made public today, is ``outrageous.''
   The charges against Johnston, USX, and Thermon Phillips and E.B.
Rich of the United Steelworkers of America stem from a federal
investigation of the negotiations leading to a 1983 union contract
for USX's Fairfield Works at Birmingham.
   The indictments alleged that as part of the negotiations the
company agreed to secretly set up pensions for Rich, Phillips and
four other union negotiators, although the six were not eligible
for the benefits. In return, the grand jury alleged, Rich and
Phillips agreed to make concessions in the Fairfield Works contract.
   Johnston, then a USX labor-relations executive, played a key
role in USX's change of its pension-plan rules to include the union
negotiators.
   Thursday's indictment charged Johnston, of McMurray, Pa., with
conspiracy, causing USX to make the pension payments to Phillips
and Rich, and causing the company's pension fund to fail to inform
its participants of the rule change. The grand jury had indicted
Johnston on the latter charge two weeks ago.
   In a court document, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Rasmussen
reported the government would seek to combine Johnston's case with
that of the company and union leaders, who face trial March 5.
   Johnston, if convicted on all four counts, could face a maximum
penalty of 20 years in prison and a $1.1 million fine, said U.S.
Attorney Frank W. Donaldson.
   Johnston repeated a statement he issued last month in which he
defended his actions and those of the company in granting the
pensions. He said the union had requested the rule change for
years, other large companies had similar rules and the change was
based in part on a written legal opinion of the U.S. Department of
Labor.
   The company rescinded the change in 1987 after learning of
recent court decisions indicating it was illegal, Johnston said.
   Fairfield employees had sued the company and the union leaders,
claiming collusion in the granting of the pensions and seeking the
voiding of the 1983 agreement, which cut wages and benefits in
return for the reopening of the plant. That lawsuit is on hold in
Birmingham federal court pending the resolution of the criminal
charges.
   In the news release, Johnston's lawyer, Stanley S. Arkin of New
York City, said the charges result ``from the economic frustrations
of some former union-represented employees of USX Corporation and
is no more and no less than a classic example of translating
dissatisfaction into scapegoating.''

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade following a weekly
Agriculture Department report showing relatively light export sales
of corn and soybeans.
   The early declines also reflected followthrough selling from
Thursday's weaker close in the soybean market, which fell sharply
late in the day when commercial players became heavy sellers.
   ``Yesterday's session was really disappointing,'' said analyst
Joel Karlin of Research Department Inc. in Chicago. ``We had a
perfect environment for these things to rally ... and they couldn't
rally.''
   An overnight increase in farmer sales of corn and soybeans added
to the selling pressure this morniing.
   Karlin predicted the losses would be offset by buying later in
the session as traders even up their positions ahead of the weekend.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were { cent to 1 cent
lower with the contract for delivery in March at $4.08{ a bushel;
corn futures were { cent to 1{ cents lower with March at $2.37{ a
bushel; oats were { cent lower to } cent higher with March at $1.51
a bushel; soybeans were } cent to 2 cents lower with January at
$5.61{ a bushel.
   Some hog and pork belly futures surged their respective daily
trading limits of 1.5 cents and 2 cents a pound on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in a continuing reaction to Wednesday's USDA
report showing a smaller hog-and-pig supply than traders had
expected.
   Live hog futures were .75 cent to 1.5 cents higher with February
at 51.42 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 2 cents higher
across the board with February at 53.47 cents a pound; live cattle
were .02 cent to .40 cent higher with February at 77.10 cents a
pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .20 cent higher with
January at 84.75 cents a pound.
   Pork futures settled limit-up Thursday; cattle futures were
mostly higher.

<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 86,000 radial truck tires have been
recalled by Bridgestone@Firestone Inc. because of potential
cracking in the inner lining, the company said.
   The recall announced Thursday involved over-the-road, drive-axle
truck tires with the model designation T546 PSD Radial, in sizes
10R22.5, 11R22.5, 11R24.5, 295@75R22.5 and 285@75R24.5.
   The tires were produced during the past two years at a company
plant in Bilbao, Spain, the company said.
   Most of the recall tires were sold by independent Firestone
dealers. The tires were sold across the nation without a focus on
any single region, said Firestone spokesman Bob Troyer.
   He said replacement tires have an average selling price of $250
each. Firestone brand dealers and stores were being notified
Thursday.
   The defect could result in sidewall failure, but there has been
no report of any accident or injury resulting from the condition,
the company said in a statement.
   Chicago-based Bridgestone@Firestone is relocating its corporate
to Akron, which had long been headquarters of the former Firestone
Tire &amp; Rubber Co.
   The potential defect was noticed when some of the tires in
question were checked after road damage during retreading.
   ``We want to be certain that our customers obtain the maximum
potential from Firestone radial truck tires both during the
original tread life and in the retread stage,'' said Thomas R.
Mertz, director of sales and marketing for Firestone brand tires.
   ``Therefore, on a voluntary basis, we are initiating this recall
today to replace these tires,'' he said. Only the tubeless tires
are involved, he added.
   Troyer also on Thursday confirmed an Akron Beacon Journal report
that the company has targeted about 80 of its 1,600 MasterCare auto
service stores for sale or closing.
   Troyer said the closings or sale of stores are part of the
normal course of business and do not reflect a financial problem.

sell the rights to Sea World Inc., a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch,
was made Thursday.
   Anheuser-Busch has owned Shamu since it paid $1.1 billion in
November to buy four Sea World parks, two additional theme parks
and adjacent land from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., but the
marketing rights were not part of the deal.
   Under the agreement, Watson General also will get royalties of
10 percent on the gross sales of Shamu merchandise sold outside the
theme parks and 50 percent of all the net proceeds from ``Shamu ...
The Beginning,'' a recently completed animated film included in the
sale.

<HEAD>Prospect Group Plans To Spin Off Illinois Central, Sylvan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Illinois Central railroad has gone through
another management twist with the announcement that The Prospect
Group Inc. will spin it off just 10 months after its acquisition
and one year after it went independent.
   Prospect, a New York-based conglomerate, announced plans
Thursday to distribute common stock in Illinois Central Corp. and
Sylvan Foods Inc. to Prospect shareholders.
   Prospect said it will retain a stake of about 50 percent in
Illinois Central's common stock and will completely divest itself
of Sylvan Foods common stock. But Prospect said it will retain
voting control over both companies for several years through its
preferred stock holdings.
   Prospect said it expects stock in both companies to be traded,
like Prospect's, on the over-the-counter market.
   Sylvan, based in Worthington, Pa., is a major producer of
mushrooms and mushroom spawn, the equivalent of seed.
   The Chicago-based railroad hauls freight between the Great Lakes
and the Gulf of Mexico. It has undergone several changes in the
past year.
   Last January the railroad's parent, formerly IC Industries Inc.,
spun off Illinois Central to shareholders. IC changed its name to
Whitman Corp. to reflect its commmitment to consumer products,
including Whitman chocolates.
   The 139-year-old railroad immediately attracted investors
because of its growth potential. With the Mississippi River drawn
down sharply by the previous summer's drought, the Illinois Central
provided Midwestern grain shippers with an alternative to logjammed
river barges.
   The railroad's common stock began trading on the New York Stock
Exchange Jan. 3, 1989, at $11 a share and climbed to $14 by Jan. 16
after Illinois grain processor Archer Daniels Midland Co. announced
it had acquired 8 percent of Illinois Central's stock.
   Prospect came in with an unsolicited $20-a-share cash tender
offer on Jan. 27 and the parties announced a $436 million deal on
March 10.
   Prospect already had three Southeastern railroads and either
owned or was affiliated with the Forschner Group Inc., the U.S.
marketer of Swiss army knives; the National Automobile and Casualty
Insurance Co.; and the National Spirit Group, which runs
cheerleader camps and manufactures cheerleader uniforms.
   In a statement issued late Thursday in New York, Prospect
Chairman W. Wallace McDowell Jr. said Illinois Central and Sylvan
had both done well under the Prospect umbrella.
   ``The performance of both of these companies in the past several
months makes us very optimistic about the future,'' McDowell said.
   ``By making the distributions at this time, Prospect
shareholders will realize the direct benefit of appreciation in the
two companies while retaining their interest in The Prospect
Group.''
   Illinois Central had operating income of $25.5 million on
revenue of $125.8 million for the quarter that ended Sept. 30,
Prospect said.
   For the quarter that ended Sept. 30, Sylvan had operating income
of $2.3 million on revenue of $18.7 million.

<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems,
which laid off 100 of its 450 workers this week, is the latest
minicomputer maker to be hurt by the popularity of desktop
computers and workstations as replacements for larger machines.
   Norma Bryga, Computer Systems marketing director, said Thursday
the latest layoffs cut across all departments and involved managers
as well as factory workers.
   Such companies as Prime Computer Inc., Data General Corp. and
MAI Basic Four have been forced to trim workers and regroup as
sales of minicomputers have plunged in the past year.
   McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems, which laid off another 60
employees in October, is one of several computer-related divisions
that parent company McDonnell Douglas Corp. said earlier this year
it would spin off or sell because of poor performance.

<HEAD>USX Says Senate Bill Endangers Coke Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A clean-air bill pending in the Senate would
force virtually every coke plant in the nation to close,
endangering the domestic steel industry, a USX Corp. official said.
   ``If this legislation goes through the way it is now being
shaped in the Senate, there's a good chance it will signal the end
of coke-oven operations in the nation,'' said Philip X.
Masciantonio, vice president of environmental affairs for the USS
division of USX.
   ``If we can't make coke here, we don't have a steel industry,''
he told The Pittsburgh Press on Thursday. Coke is a primary
ingredient for making steel.
   The toxic pollution provisions of Senate Bill 1630, passed last
month by the Environmental and Public Works Committee, would submit
coke plants to strict new emissions standards and overhaul the
Clean Air Act in the areas of acid rain and urban smog.
   Environmentalists give varyng assessments of the bill.
   Anthony Picadio _ a lawyer for the Group Against Smog and
Pollution, a Pittsburgh environmental group that has sparred with
USX for 20 years _ said he opposes the bill because coke plants
could not meet its stringent health-protection standard. He said
the bill would never be enforced.
   But lawyers with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a
Washington-based environmental group, said the bill provides
exemptions if pollution-control technology cannot achieve the
standards. As a result, there's no reason to worry that wholesale
plant closings would occur, they said.
   ``I think it's part of a general campaign (by U.S. industry) to
paint this legislation as extreme,'' said Richard Ayres, a senior
attorney with the defense council.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, has said the
bill will be the first one considered when senators return Jan. 23
from their winter recess.
   About 40 plants in the United States bake coal in ovens to
produce coke. USX's Clairton Works, a sprawling network of ovens
and smokestacks along the Monongahela River at Clairton, is the
largest coke plant in the nation.
   The Senate bill would require each coke plant to gradually
reduce air emissions to the point that emissions would pose no more
than a one in 1 million risk of cancer to a person living downwind
all his life, Masciantonio said.
   An Environmental Protection Agency analysis shows that coke
plants pose among the highest cancer risks of all U.S. industrial
plants. For example, oven emissions from the Clairton plant pose a
cancer risk of one in 130 in the most extreme hypothetical case,
Masciantonio said.
   A 10,000-fold reduction in emissions would be needed to achieve
the bill's goal, and that's not possible with today's technology,
he said.

<HEAD>The Grassroots Are Murmuring Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By one reckoning, the states of New York and
Connecticut dropped into recession in December, joining 27 other
states that earlier had descended to that level.
   Those 29 states, representing 37.3 percent of the 89.9 million
households in America, soon could be joined by three or four
borderline states. Should that happen, it would bring the total
percentage of households to more than 50.
   These are not official government estimates, but the result of
detailed telephone calls to 3,948 households during December by
Sindlinger &amp; Co. of Wallingford, Penn., a pioneer in consumer and
economic studies.
   Decades of experience have shown, said Albert Sindlinger,
founder and chairman, that the point at which the survey tops 50
percent of households will later be recognized officially as the
time when recession began.
   That means waiting eight months. Historically, a national
recession is declared after two consecutive quarters of shrinking
gross national product. Then, it takes two more months for
statistical analysis and confirmation.
   For this reason it is often said that economists are the last to
know about a recession _ that most people sense a recession long
before it is officially confirmed, based on their own economic
experience.
   By Sindlinger's calculations, just two states and 2.4 percent of
households were in recession last January. By June, the figures had
risen to 18 states and 15.9 percent of households, and by November
to 27 states and 28.3 percent.
   The percentage of households took a big jump when Connecticut
and New York joined the recession states in December. And that
percentage could take an even bigger jump _ to more than 50 _ if
borderline states slump just slightly.
   Those four states _ New Jersey, Texas, Pennsylvania and North
Carolina, plus the District of Columbia _ account for 17.9 percent
of households. In each of these states less than 51 percent of
households responded positively.
   The greatest strenghth of all was concentrated in what used to
be called the Midwest Rust Belt, in Ohio, Indiana, Michigan,
Illinois and Wisconsin. But, Sindlinger says, they too could be
endangered by auto industry layoffs.
   Utah, Washington and Delaware were among stronger states. Rated
just above borderline were Minnesota, Oregon, California, Nevada,
Florida, Virginia and Maryland. All others _ Alaska and Hawaii
excluded _ were in recession.
   Sindlinger's definition of recession is based on answers to four
questions put to the head of each household:
   1. In your geographical area will economic conditions be better,
worse or the same next June than they are now?
   2. In your place of employment do you expect there will be more,
the same or fewer jobs?
   3. In your household do you expect higher combined income?
Lower? The same?
   4. Compared to last June, is your household income now higher,
the same or lower?
   When the respondent reports at least one negative answer the
household is said to have ``negative household liquidity,''
suggesting a curtailment of consumer spending and postponement of
discretionary spending or investing.
   When a respondent replies positively or neutrally, it means the
household is likely to continue spending and borrowing willingly
and freely at a level dictated by current income and borrowing
capacity.
   Albert Sindlinger doesn't claim we are now in a recession, but
he will make that claim if more than 50 percent of respondents give
at least one negative answer during this month.
   It isn't the first time he has been ready to make such a
declaration. His research showed 31 states in recession in 1986,
but the total of households involved amounted to just 49.5 percent,
or just shy of a majority.
   His research at that time did point out conclusively, however,
that a nation as large as the United States can go through regional
or industry recessions that stop short of becoming national
economic phenomena.
   In terms of geographic size, most of America was indeed in
recession in 1986, but the national figures were skewed by
relatively strong economies in California, Nevada, New Mexico and
in much of the East Coast and Michigan.
   Government statistics later confirmed the Sindlinger
measurements. And, says octogenarian Albert Sindlinger, they'll do
it again sometime in late summer. The grassroots, he said, know the
story before the economists.

   Share prices finished slightly lower Friday on
London's stock exchange.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 7.1
points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 2,444.5.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 8.5 points at
1,948.8 at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 4.74
points to close at 1,331.98.
   Volume amounted to 469.7 million shares, compared with 675.7
million shares Thursday.
   The market began the session shakily, as a sharp drop earlier in
Tokyo unsettled nerves.
   Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 selected issues fell 438.12 points
to 38,274.76 Friday on news that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
canceled all his January foreign engagements to concentrate on
domestic troubles.
   ``The (London) market had its troubles trying to cope with
Japan's movements,'' said one market maker. ``The day just started
off badly, which increased investor awareness about how shaky
market sentiment is at the moment.''

   Stock prices lost ground today in an atmosphere
of uneasiness over the economic outlook and political developments

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 16.43 to
2,779.65 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 544 up, 897 down and

   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment
rate held steady at 5.3 percent in December. The data showed a
smaller-than-expected 142,000 increase in nonfarm payroll
employment.
   Traders in the bond market took that as favorable news,
suggesting that the pace of the economy remained sluggish enough to
allow the Federal Reserve to consider further moves toward easier
credit.
   But stock-market investors evidently read the figures as a sign
that further weakness might be in store for corporate earnings in
the months ahead.
   Analysts also said the market was unsettled by reports that
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev canceled foreign engagements to

<HEAD>Appeals Court Denies IRS Attempt to Block Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court in Georgia has
cleared the way for creditors of former Ohio financier Marvin
Warner to begin receiving payments from a $16 million settlement
approved last month by federal bankruptcy judge.
   In a two-sentence order released Thursday, the 11th Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta denied an attempt by the Internal
Revenue Service to block the immediate distribution of $10 million
under Warner's settlement agreement.
   The remaining $6 million pledged to creditors will be
distributed over the next three years.
   A total of $3.6 million in payments to attorneys and accountants
also can begin, attorneys for the creditors' committee said
Thursday.
   The IRS objected to the Chapter 11 settlement approved last
month by Bankruptcy Judge George L. Proctor in Jacksonville,
claiming Warner's assets would diminish over the coming years and
the IRS would not get $13 million it claims Warner owes in taxes
and interest. Warner's settlement plan calls for those charges to
be paid over six years.
   Warner, 70, the former owner of Home State Savings Bank of Ohio,
ran into financial trouble when the thrift collapsed in 1985,
triggering a crisis for Ohio savings and loans.
   Warner, a former U.S. ambassador to Switzerland who now lives on
an Ocala horse farm, filed for Chapter 11 financial reorganization
in October 1987 to consolidate $4.5 billion sought in lawsuits
against him as a result of the Home State collapse.
   The thrift collapsed in March 1985 four days after ESM
Government Securities Inc. of Fort Lauderdale was closed by
government regulators for insolvency. Home State had invested
heavily in ESM through securities trades and lost $144 million when
ESM closed.
   Meanwhile, Ohio prosecutors are trying to get reinstated
Warner's conviction on charges related to the Home State collapse.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed narrowly
mixed Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade with wheat slightly
higher, corn slightly lower and soybeans little changed.
   The wheat market got a late boost from news that China was
bidding for 300,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices
under an offer made previously by the Agriculture Department.
   Corn and soybean futures were pressured by the USDA's weekly
grain exports report, issued late Thursday, which showed relatively
light shipments of U.S. grains last week.
   Soybean futures traded lower for much of the session, then
rallied near the close as traders who had sold borrowed contracts
earlier in the week evened up their positions ahead of the weekend.
   At the close, wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cent higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.09{ a bushel; corn was {

<HEAD>Federal Approval Grants for First Direct Phone Link between
Alaska, Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Alaskan telephone company Friday received
final federal approval for what is believed to be the first direct
telephone link between Alaska and the Soviet Union.
   The Federal Communications Commission said Alascom may establish
as many as 12 two-way, UHF radio-phone circuits between Gambell,
Alaska, and Provideniya, Magadan, the Soviet Union.
   The service began in August after federal authorities gave
Alascom verbal approval to proceed, pending final authorization,
according to Alascom's Washington attorney, Charles Naftalin.
   He said several circuits were operating smoothly except for
occasional technical difficulties on the Soviet end.
   Gambell, which is on St. Lawrence Island, is only about 62 miles
from Magadan across the Bering Strait, but prior to this new
service, telephone calls between Alaska and the Soviet Far East
were routed through thousands of miles of land and undersea phone
lines or satellite relays.
   Naftalin said it was the ``first terrestrial link ever between
the U.S. and Soviet Union,'' but at this point it's only for
Alaskans.
   The transmitter at Gambell is linked to a satellite ground
station that can relay telephone signals to an Alascom receiving
station near Fairbanks.
   But, Naftalin said, ``It's not configured yet to allow both
nations to generally call back and forth.''
   In seeking federal permission, Alascom said ``a direct link is
important in light of the strong community of interest between
Alaskans and the Soviet Far East, including close family ties among
native populations,'' the FCC said.
   The commission, in finding the new service in the public
interest and convenience, noted that Alascom's proposal was
supported by the State Department, contingent upon a finding that
there will be no transfer of equipment that may be used militarily.
   Alascom will own and supply all transmitting and receiving
equipment, including the equipment installed on the Soviet end, the
FCC said.
   The FCC previously ruled that Alascom could use radio
frequencies generally reserved for cellular phone services.
   The new service will include messaging, private line and data
communications.

   European Community officials may meet
soon to mull additional aid to Romania and to seek normal
diplomatic relations with that country now that dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu has fallen, EC officials said Friday.
   A paper by the European Commission, the community's executive
body, also urged the community to financially support economic
reform efforts in the East and reach trade agreements with those
countries.
   ``There is a common interest on the part of the community, its
neighbors and all states sharing its fundamental values in ensuring
that reform in East Europe does not founder,'' the paper read.
   The paper presented Thursday at a meeting of top commission
officials, said a meeting could be held soon to examine Romania's
need for additional assistance from the 12-nation trading bloc,
also known as the Common Market.
   ``In the course of these discussions, it will be pointed out to
the Romanian side that the time has come to establish normal
diplomatic relations with the community,'' according to the
document.
   The paper also stated the Common Market should be prepared to
restart negotiations, which have been stalled since 1987, on a
trade and economic cooperation agreement with Romania.
   The two sides arranged a limited trade pact in industrial
products in 1980. The community agreed in 1986 to discuss extending
the arrangement to agricultural products and economic cooperation,
but no serious negotiations were held.
   The community has negotiated four trade-expanding agreements
with Eastern European countries since it established formal ties in
June 1988 with the socialist economic bloc, known as the Council
for Mutual Economic Assistance, or Comecon.
   The Common Market has wide-ranging trade and economic
cooperation accords with Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union and a
smaller pact with Czechoslovakia.
   The commission document also said the community was close to a
pact with Bulgaria. It also said new negotiations with East Germany
should end in an agreement within the first half of the year and
that informal contacts have been made with Czechoslovakia to
discuss extending its arrangement to trade and economic cooperation.
   The paper reflected the community's growing interest in
developing strong ties with the emerging democracies in Eastern
Europe. It has led an effort by two dozen Western nations to
fashion an economic aid program to encourage reforms in Hungary and
Poland.
   ``The pace of change in East Europe, the expectations of the
peoples concerned and of their governments as well as the
community's own interests in the political and economic future of
Europe now require the community to take further initiatives,'' the
paper read.
   The paper said Ireland, which currently holds the community's
rotating presidency, was considering calling a special meeting this
month of community foreign ministers to discuss further aid to
Romania and other topics. But a spokesman for the presidency later
issued a statement saying there were no immediate plans for a
special session. The foreign ministers already are scheduled to
meet in early February.
   In a separate document, the commission said it will provide a
total of $7.7 million in emergency aid, including food and medical
supplies, over the next three months to Romania. It said it has
sent at least $1.2 million worth of help since late December.

   Anheuser-Busch Inc. said Friday it plans to
begin selling its new non-alcoholic brew, O'Doul's, around the
country starting on Monday.
   The brewery reported strong initial sales in selected cities,
where the beer has been on shelves since March, it said in a news
release.
   Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewery, said O'Doul's would
meet the desires of a growing segment of consumers who like the
taste of beer but don't want the alcohol.
   Other breweries, including Miller Brewing Co., have recently
introduced non-alcoholic beers in an effort to meet head-on a
growing anti-drinking sentiment and to offset falling beer sales
with a wider variety of products.
   Miller's entry, called Sharp, has been on sale around the nation
for several weeks.
   Annual production in the United States of non-alcoholic beers is
about one million barrels a year, compared with the national beer
market of more than 182 million barrels.
   But analysts say the non-alcoholic segment is growing at the
rate of 10 percent to 15 percent a year, while the overall beer
market has been stable.

   The stock market retreated today amid uneasiness
over the economic outlook and political developments in the Soviet
Union.
   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment
rate held steady at 5.3 percent in December. The data showed a
smaller-than-expected 142,000 increase in nonfarm payroll
employment.
   Traders in the bond market took that as favorable news,
suggesting that the pace of the economy remained sluggish enough to
allow the Federal Reserve to consider further moves toward easier
credit.
   But stock-market investors evidently read the figures as a sign
that further weakness might be in store for corporate earnings in
the months ahead.
   Analysts also said the market was unsettled by reports that
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev canceled foreign engagements to
deal with domestic problems.

<HEAD>Maine Attorney General Files Antitrust Challenge To Great Northern
Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCIS X. QUINN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Maine attorney general asked a state
judge on Friday to block Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s $3.8 billion bid
to take over Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. on antitrust grounds.
   The state said in a lawsuit filed in Superior Court that a
successful takeover of Great Northern by Georgia-Pacific would
``substantially lessen competition'' in several portions of the
pulpwood industry in Maine, particularly hardwood pulpwood.
   In response, Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. said
in a statement from Atlanta that the lawsuit was without merit.
Hahn promised a vigorous defense and predicted Georgia-Pacific
would win.
   ``We do not believe our acquisition of Great Northern violates
antitrust laws in Maine or anywhere else,'' Hahn said.
   The suit also said an acquisition by Georgia-Pacific similarly
could harm the real estate market by reducing competition in ``the
sale of remote lakeshore property of significant recreational and
scenic value.''
   ``The primary concern underlying the state's case is that
Georgia-Pacific's acquisition will thwart Great Northern's ongoing
development of a major world-class pulp mill in Millinocket,''
Attorney General James E. Tierney said in a prepared statement.
   ``Great Northern's mill will be in operation by 1995. However,
that mill and the increased competitive activity which it will
bring to northern Maine's forest products industry will be lost if
this acquisition is completed,'' Tierney said.
   By acquiring Great Northern's mills and land in Maine, Tierney
said Georgia-Pacific would ``control too much power in the market
for the purchase of wood.''
   ``Georgia-Pacific's high market share will allow it to suppress
the price paid to landowners and contractors below competitive
levels,'' he said.
   Georgia-Pacific disputed those claims, noting that the federal
government had already looked into the proposed merger but found no
potential antitrust problems.
   ``Not only are the charges without merit, but in large part
duplicate the exhaustive antitrust examinations already completed
by the Federal Trade Commission,'' Hahn said. ``We are confident
that Georgia-Pacific will prevail on all counts.''
   Great Northern applauded the state's challenge to the merger
attempt.
   ``We feel that the attorney general's action reflects our view
that it would be illegal,'' Great Northern spokesman Stephen M.
Hill said from his office in Norwalk, Conn. Great Northern has a
separate lawsuit in federal court in Connecticut that challenges
the merger attempt on antitrust grounds.
   On Thursday, Great Northern asked U.S. District Judge Gene
Carter in Portland to issue a preliminary injunction halting
Georgia-Pacific's takeover attempt, as well as its attempt to have
Great Northern's board ousted.
   Great Northern has set March 2 as the date of a special
shareholders' meeting to decide whether the company's present board
of directors should be ousted.
   In a separate meeting on March 20, Great Northern shareholders
are scheduled to decide whether to exercise so-called ``poison
pill'' provisions to avoid the takeover.

   The overheated fuel oil and orange juice futures markets showed
signs of cooling but commodity bulls quickly found another pasture:
the hog futures pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Pork futures prices shot up late in the week following a
government report that showed a smaller hog supply than most
traders had expected.
   The report was the latest in a series of bullish fundamental
factors that have kept hog futures prices moving mainly upward
since late summer.
   Hogs for February delivery settled Friday at 50.95 cents a pound
compared with 48.70 cents a week earlier and about 43 cents at the
end of August.
   The gains came in reaction to the Agriculture Department's
quarterly hogs-and-pigs inventory, which showed a 3 percent drop in
the national herd size from the end of 1988 to the end of 1989.
   The report also indicated that springtime farrowing intentions _
a measure of expected herd expansion _ were down 6 percent from a
year ago.
   The numbers surprised market analysts whose observations of
slaughter rates relative to the September inventory report had led
them to expect little change in the end-of-the-year tally.
   The new numbers partly reflected a sharp downward revision in
the September inventory number. Some market analysts were incensed
by the change, contending the USDA's quarterly inventory numbers
are too frequently out of whack with reality.
   But the numbers can't be ignored by the farmers, meatpackers,
food processors and traders who plan their livelihoods based in
part on the government reports.
   ``In one sense, they're the only game in town so we have no
choice but to use their numbers,'' said analyst Dale Durchholz of
AgriVisor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.
   Charles Levitt, senior livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said large-scale revisions in the quarterly inventory
numbers have become too common, creating uncertainty and risk in
the futures market.
   ``If we get a supply report like this that moves up the price
and then turns out to be wrong, the break on the back side is going
to be double the increase,'' he said.

   The dramatic rally in energy futures that began with last
month's cold snap appeared to be slowing as temperatures rose,
reducing demand for heating oil and easing the strain on oil
refineries.
   A 10-cents-a-gallon plunge in the February heating-oil contract
over the last two trading sessions of the week was the strongest
indication that the runup had peaked.
   Nevertheless, the American Petroleum Institute reported U.S.
heating-oil inventories at a 10-year low and ``maybe at the lowest
level ever in terms of demand,'' said analyst Andrew Lebow of E.D.
&amp; F. Man International Futures Inc.
   ``The underlying fundamentals of heating oil are still
favorable,'' he said.

<HEAD>Orange Juice</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Orange juice futures gained for the fourth straight week on the
New York Cotton Exchange, but the rate of increase slowed as
Brazilian processors resumed shipments of juice to the United
States on Thursday after a week-long suspension.
   Brazil, which accounted for 20 percent of the orange juice
consumed in the United States last year, suspended exports to take
stock of the market and raise prices after a damaging freeze struck
Florida's citrus belt over the Christmas weekend.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice for January delivery settled
Friday at $1.7965 a pound compared with $1.6565 a week earlier.

   Gold and silver futures ended higher on the week after snapping

   Hallmark Cards Inc. has agreed to purchase
Dakin Inc., one of the world's top producers of stuffed toys, a
joint announcement said on Friday.
   The purchase price was not disclosed.
   The tentative sale, subject to a final agreement expected within
three months, merges the world's largest producer of greeting cards
with the world's largest marketer of plush stuffed toys, with sales
of $150 million annually.
   Founded in 1955, San Francisco-based Dakin grew to its current
position from initial annual sales of $500,000, the company
reported.
   ``Dakin is an outstanding company whose strengths complement
those of Hallmark's core business,'' said Hallmark President Robert
L. Stark at company headquarters in Kansas City, Mo. Hallmark has
annual sales of about $2.5 billion.
   Besides stuffed toys, Dakin makes dolls, puppets, photo frames
and other gift items. The company employs some 600 people, with
manufacturing plants in Lindsay, Calif., and Honolulu.

   Stock prices in the Far East fell sharply Friday on the news
that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev had canceled foreign
engagements to deal with domestic worries. But the jitters were
less severe in other world markets.
   In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei index tumbled 600 points before
recovering to finish 438.12 points lower at 38,274.76. The decline
measured 1.1 percent decline and was the worst showing since Oct.
16, when the key index lost 647 points.
   The high-flying Japanese market, which had chalked up several
record highs in the final days of 1989, was ripe for a big selloff,
according to some experts.
   But the sharp reaction to the Soviet report underscored Japanese
investors' attention to the situation in Eastern Europe and
Gorbachev's key role in establishing stability in the region.
   ``To Japan, the worst thing that could happen to the world
scenario would be for Gorbachev to drop from sight,'' said Chris
Schreiber, an investment analyst with New Japan Securities in Tokyo.
   The Hong Kong Stock Exchange also closed sharply lower, with the
Hang Seng Index falling 28.01 points to 2,839.94. Brokers there
also attributed the losses to reports that Gorbachev canceled a
meeting with British Labor Party leaders in Moscow and postponed
all other contacts with foreign politicians.
   ``It created a public embarrassment and a setback for him,''
said Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. in New York. Gorbachev's move prompted traders
to speculate that the problems in the Soviet Union ``must be pretty
bad,'' Brusca said.
   But the response in other major world markets was more tempered.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials lost 22.83
points to close at 2,773.25.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 share index
lost 7.1 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 2,444.5. In Frankfurt,
the DAX index fell 15.88 points to finish at 1,820.00, but well up
from the day's low of 1,804.35.
   Analysts said that hardest hit among Tokyo stocks were those of
Japanese trading houses, which had been recommended by brokers
based on the ``detente theme.'' Marubeni shares lost 5 percent and
C. Itoh and Co. suffered an even greater decline.
   ``One of the big themes (in Japan) is that the greatest
opportunites are going to be in Russia,'' Brusca said. ``As you set
that back, you set all the investment strategies everyone has been
pushing.''

   American Express Co. said Friday it will receive
a $200 million cash infusion from Nippon Life Insurance Co.,
strengthening an alliance between the two financial services giants
that began more than two years ago.
   Under terms of their agreement, Nippon will purchase American
Express exchangeable preferred shares, which can be converted at
any time to American Express common stock at a share price of
$42.50.
   Should Nippon exercise those rights, as well as a warrant issued
in 1987 allowing it to purchase 2 million American Express shares
at $50 apiece, the Japanese insurance giant would have a 1.6
percent stake in American Express, according to American Express
spokesman Matthew Stover.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, American Express fell 37{ cents
to close at $34.50 a share. The stock's 52-week high is $39.37{ a
share.
   Nippon and American Express forged an alliance in May 1987 when
Nippon purchased a 13 percent stake in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
the brokerage firm controlled by American Express.
   Shearson, Wall Street's second-largest brokerage, has suffered
recently from weak profits and is in the process of a $900 million
recapitalization program spearheaded by American Express. The
restructuring, unveiled last month, followed announcements that
Shearson would lay off hundreds of employees and make deep cuts in
stockbroker commissions.
   American Express officials were quick to point out that Nippon's
current investment plans have nothing to do with Shearson.
   ``The timing was coincidental,'' Stover said. ``We have a
relationship with Nippon, we've done a lot of things with them.
They have expressed an interest in investing in American Express,
and now they're doing it.''
   Stover called the investment a ``reflection of the close
cooperation between the two companies.''
   Japanese firms have had a long-standing interest in investing in
American financial companies. In 1986 Sumitomo Bank Ltd. invested
about $500 million in Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. in return for a
non-voting stake in the firm.
   Little more than a year later, Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance Co.
paid $300 million for an 18 percent voting stake in PaineWebber
Group Inc. And in 1988 Japan's largest brokerage, Nomura Securities
Co., acquired a 20 percent stake in the takeover boutique
Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co. for $100 million.
   Howard Clark Jr., American Express's chief financial officer,
said the deal ``adds $200 million to our equity base, broadens and
deepens our existing relationship with Nippon Life and fits in with
our goal to expand our strategic global alliances.''
   American Express reported net income of $899.8 million, or $2.09
a share for the nine months ended Sept. 30, up 11.4 percent from
$807.5 million, or $1.89 a share a year earlier. Revenue rose 24
percent to $18.73 billion from $15.09 billion a year earlier.
   Figures for the full year will be released later this month.

   Federated Department Stores Inc. said Friday
it is elimimating 52 jobs at its corporate headquarters here,
reducing the staff at the base of Campeau Corp.'s U.S. retail
operations by 14 percent.
   About one-third of the jobs were related to operating and
maintaining four corporate aircraft that are being sold to cut back
expenses and help with cash flow, Federated said.
   The rest of the jobs are in the areas of store planning and real
estate, indicating Federated expects fewer new store openings.
   Federated and Allied Stores Corp., also based in Cincinnati,
warned last month that they might be forced to file for protection
from creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code unless
bondholders agree to reschedule certain debts.
   Their corporate parent, Campeau, a Canadian retail and real
estate company, has been trying to cope with cash crunch. Campeau
took over Federated in 1988 in a $6.7 billion acquisition after
acquiring Allied in 1986 for $3.4 billion.
   Allied and Federated won a temporary reprieve this week from a
threat by bank lenders to declare the stores in technical default
on a $2.34 billion loan. The banking syndicate led by Citibank
agreed to give the chains until Jan. 15 to show they're making
progress in bringing their financial problems under control.

   The dollar staged a turnaround Friday, closing
mostly higher in domestic dealings after taking a sharp hit in
overseas markets that were focusing on events in Eastern Europe.
   Gold prices soared by as much as $9 an ounce. On the Commodity
Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery jumped
$7.70 to settle at $406.30 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank in
New York quoted a late bid for gold at $406.25 an ounce, up $7.50
from Thursday's late bid.
   News that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev canceled January
appointments with foreign officials so he could deal with domestic
problems sparked the hike in gold prices but sent stock prices
skidding and frightened currency markets worldwide.
   ``So much depends on him keeping peace in the Eastern bloc and
to give enough room for progress to continue,'' said Jack Barbanel,
managing director of First Global Managers in Princeton, N.J.
   While foreign markets focused on Gorbachev's political health,
domestic traders keyed in on a Labor Department report that showed
the unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent last month, while
the addition of 142,000 non-farm jobs was weaker than expected.
   ``The dollar dropped off rather sharply on the weak number,''
said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co. The report gave further fuel to the argument that the
U.S. economy is slowing and that the Federal Reserve might move to
lower interest rates.
   Foreign appetite for dollars is dampened when the yields on U.S.
securities decline.
   Traders also noted that the Fed entered the market to sell
dollars for yen, pushing the dollar lower against the Japanese
currency.
   A lower dollar will help ensure ``we have some advantage in
continuing the level of exports (to Japan),'' which in turn aids in
improving the trade deficit, Barbanel noted.
   Despite the negative news, technical factors pushed the dollar
higher at the close of trading.
   ``The volume was high, and trading was somewhat chaotic,''
Flanagan said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 144.15 Japanese yen, from 145.20
yen on Thursday. Later in London, it fell to 143.75 yen. In New
York, the dollar finished at 144.50 yen, up from 143.65 yen on
Thursday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6375 from $1.6290 late
Thursday. In New York, it cost $1.6350 to buy one pound, unchanged
fom Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.6895 West German marks, up from 1.6800;
1.5445 Swiss francs, up from 1.5395; 5.5778 French francs, down
from 5.7450; 1,276.25 Italian lire, up from 1,263.00, and 1.1608
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1607.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday
included: 1.6810 West German marks, down from 1.6825; 1.5365 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5410; 5.7405 French francs, down from 5.7500;
1.9030 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9275; 1,263.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,265.25, and 1.1595 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1610.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $404.50 a troy ounce,

   The Agriculture Department announced on Friday
the rates for advance federal payments when farmers begin to sign
up for 1990 crop programs later in the month.
   Keith Bjerke, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said the advance payments will be reduced
by 1.4 percent as required by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1989.
   Farmers will be able to sign up in 1990 crop programs Jan. 16
through April 13 at local offices of the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   The cash advances are made to help tide farmers over until crops
are harvested and will be deducted from their total ``deficiency''
payments at the end of the season.
   Deficiency payments _ based on a crop's acreage and program
yield per acre _ make up the difference between a target price and
the average market price during a specified period of the marketing
season.
   Adjusted advance deficiency payment rates for 1990, allowing for
the 1.4 percent budget reductions, include:
   _Wheat, 33.67 cents per bushel.
   _Corn, 33.67 cents per bushel.
   _Sorghum, 34.19 cents per bushel.
   _Barley, 8.4 cents per bushel.
   _Oats, none.
   _Upland cotton, 3.685 cents per pound.
   _Extra-long staple cotton, none.
   _Rice, $1.5725 per 100 pounds.

   Stock prices declined Friday in the face of
economic uncertainties and worries over political developments in
the Soviet Union.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 22.83 to 2,773.25,
reducing its gain for the week to 20.05 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
591 up, 931 down and 453 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 158.53 million
shares, down from 177 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 191.73 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment
rate held steady at 5.3 percent in December. The data showed a
smaller-than-expected 142,000 increase in nonfarm payroll
employment.
   Traders in the bond market took that as favorable news,
suggesting that the pace of the economy remained sluggish enough to
allow the Federal Reserve to consider further moves toward easier
credit.
   But stock-market investors evidently read the figures as a sign
that further weakness might be in store for corporate earnings in
the months ahead.
   Analysts also said the market was unsettled by reports that
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev canceled foreign engagements to
deal with domestic problems.
   Several Europen country funds gave up some of their recent gains
on the chance that the Soviet situation might delay or disrupt new
trade opportunities in eastern Europe.
   Germany Fund fell 2} to 17, posting the day's biggest percentage
loss among NYSE issues; Austria Fund was down 1\ at 20|, and Italy
Fund lost } to 15{.
   Malaysia Fund, by contrast, gained 1} to 21~, and First
Philippine Fund rose ~ to 14}.
   Regional telephone stocks sold off in a general flow of money
out of the ``defensive'' issues that gained many followers in late
1989.
   Southwestern Bell dropped 3 to 59\; Pacific Telesis 1{ to 47};
Bell South 1~ to 55|, and Nynex 1&lsqb; to 86&rsqb;.
   Losers among other actively traded blue chips included General
Electric, down | at 65|; Merck, down 1| at 77; American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, down } at 44|, and McDonald's, down | at 33\.
   International Business Machines, which had been rallying from
depressed levels in recent sessions, slipped back \ to 99}.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $26.40 billion, or 0.77
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.66 to 194.63.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 3.39 to 404.20, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 3.47 at 352.20.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped 1.17 to 458.22. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 382.45, up .29.

   The General Services Administration has asked
the FBI to investigate whether vandalism caused a serious flood at
U.S. Bankruptcy Court that knocked out power to the building and
forced judges and staff to relocate, a GSA official said Friday.
   William J. Diamond, GSA's regional administrator for the
Northeast, told The Associated Press there was ``sufficient
evidence'' to believe vandalism was behind the Christmas Eve flood
in the basement of the landmark courthouse in lower Manhattan.
   However, he declined to say whether it appeared that the damage
was directed at any particular case being handled by the court,
whose docket includes the Eastern Airlines bankruptcy proceeding
and numerous other cases.
   Diamond said the flood knocked out all phone service and power,
including auxiliary generators, and submerged utility equipment in
about 5{ feet of water. The building now is empty except for repair
crews.
   Diamond said the flood caused an estimated $500,000 damage to
the building. He said a valve apparently was removed from the water
main feeding the building's fire sprinkler system, thereby
unleashing the flood.
   A subway station across the street from the Art Deco-era
building, also was flooded and was closed temporarily.
   The FBI and GSA have jurisdiction over investigations regarding
federal buildings.
   The courthouse is the site of hearings on numerous bankruptcy
cases, including Eastern's Chapter 11 reorganization. No documents
related to the cases currently are available to the public due to
space restrictions in the area where they temporarily are housed.
   The bankruptcy judges have been hearing cases in a federal
courthouse several blocks away. Clerks and other staff temporarily
have been relocated across the street.
   Diamond said the investigation was turned over to the FBI on
Thursday. FBI officials didn't immediately return calls Friday
seeking comment.
   ``The building is not habitable right now,'' said Kathleen
Farrell, chief deputy clerk of the bankruptcy court.
   She said things should be back to normal ``hopefully by the end
of January,'' as contractors and repair crews work around the clock
in the building.
   The computer used to store data related to the Eastern
bankruptcy proceeding has been down since the flood, she said.

   Scandinavian Airlines System has agreed
to pay around $15 million for a 30 percent share in LAN, the
Chilean flag carrier, LAN President Guillermo Carey said.
   Carey told the Santiago newspaper El Mercurio that the agreement
will not affect LAN's present traffic rights, which include
profitable routes to the United States and several Latin American
countries.
   LAN, which was established four decades ago as a state-owned
airline, was sold last year to a private investment group headed by
Carey, as part of a far-reaching program to privatize government
companies launched by the military government.
   Carey told the newspaper that the agreement, among other things,
will allow LAN to share office space with SAS in many cities,
``which will mean not only a larger international coverage for us,
but also a considerable money saving.''
   He said SAS also will participate in a planned $30 million
capital increase. He gave no details, however.

   HOWEY-IN-THE-HILLS, Fla. (AP) _ Europe's top agricultural
official disagreed with major trading partners Friday, saying a
summit had done little to resolve major differences over import
restrictions and export subsidies.
   But Ray MacSharry _ representing the 12-nation European
Community in informal talks with the United States, Japan, Canada
and Australia _ conceded ``We did see where we need to make
progress.''
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and farm ministers
from Canada and Australia said the closed-door sessions had
smoothed the path toward final negotiations for a trade pact being
hammered out by the 96 nations of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.
   The European Community, which plans to dismantle internal trade
barriers in 1992, is in serious conflict with the U.S. and other
nations over farm supports and subsidies.
   MacSharry contends European farming is too diverse and that the
EC's 10 million farmers need government support, import
restrictions, export subsidies and other assistance to continue
feeding 300 million people.
   Yeutter, Australia's John Kerin and Canada's Donald Mazankowski
emphasized their discussions were meant to advance the GATT
negotiations for more liberal trade policies.
   Yeutter was especially outspoken over what he called ``subsidies
that are distortive to world trade.''
   MacSharry told reporters after the 1{-day meeting at the Mission
Inn resort that the EC didn't like U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills' ``tarrification'' proposal and would continue to insist on
``rebalancing.''
   Yeutter explained the concept of tarrification like this at a
news conference: ``The principal import restrictions (around the
world) are non-tariff measures. The way to deal with that is to
convert them into tariffs and negotiate those tariffs down.''
   Yeutter called the EC's ``rebalancing'' policy _ to liberalize
trade restrictions on some products but tighten them in others _ as
``antithetical to the spirit of the GATT. ... It is a barrier to
trade. I don't see any support for rebalancing outside the EC.''
   Australia's Kerin agreed, saying, ``Rebalancing is just another
denial of market access.''
   Mazankowski told reporters that the leaders of the world's major
farm-production areas had ``a determined resolve to address the
issues'' on international competition. The GATT negotiations are
scheduled for completion at the end of the year.
   Michihiko Kano, Japan's minister of agriculture, forestry and
fisheries, was asked whether his country's farmers would gain
anything from a strong GATT agreement. Japan has been harshly
criticized by Yeutter and others for what they call overly tough
protectionist policies.
   Speaking through an interpreter, Kano avoided any direct comment
on its policy on imports of rice and other farm products.
   As for any benefits to Japanese farmers, Kano said: ``The
meeting was not for negotiation. It was to exchange views, and
that's where the significance lies.''
   The ministers generally agreed to establish what they called a
crisis-management plan to deal with situations such as the scares
over cyanide in Chilean grapes and the use of the chemical Alar on
some American apples.
   Mazankowski, Canada's deputy prime minister and minister of
agriculture, took the lead on that issue. The U.S. is to provide a
research grant and assist in putting together such a plan.
   Food safety was a major issue in the talks, and the ministers
called for more research and a consumer-education campaign on such
things as fertilizers, pesticides and other products used to treat
commodities.
   ``There was probably a greater consensus on the food safety
issue than on the others,'' said Yeutter.

   The Federal Trade Commission announced Friday
it approved KKR Associates' divestiture of Del Monte ketchup assets
to a newly formed company.
   The ketchup assets will be acquired by DMPF Holdings Corp., a
group formed by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Citicorp Capital Investors
Ltd., Kikkoman Corp. and members of Del Monte management.
   The divestiture was part of the sale of the entire Del Monte
processed foods business by KKR, a unit of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
&amp; Co., which acquired Del Monte as part of its $24.53 billion
buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. last year.
   FTC approval of the divestiture was required by a consent order
under which Kohlberg Kravis was forced to sell either Del Monte or
its competing Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson ketchup assets.
   As a result of the consent order, the company also sold
Beatrice's Fisher Nut line, which competedwith RJR Nabisco's
Planters division, and one of its two oriental food lines.

   President Bush said Friday he is considering
housing programs, business development and bank loans to help
Panama's shattered economy recover from the U.S. invasion and years
of economic sanctions.
   Bush was not more specific on what the United States might do to
help Panama recover from invasion-related damage, estimated at
perhaps $2 billion, and from two years of economic decline that
flowed partly from the U.S. sanctions against Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   Nor did Bush address where his administration will find money to
help Panama in a foreign aid budget already strained past its
limits. Foreign assistance is among the least popular programs on
Capitol Hill, where the president would have to secure approval for
aid to Panama.
   It was learned separately that Bush administration officials are
looking into possible aid that includes:
   _Building houses for people left homeless by the bombing and
combat.
   _Helping Panama to pay its $543 million in foreign debt so it
can get new loans.
   _Getting other nations involved in the recovery effort.
   _Loans to help businesses recover.
   While recommendations have yet to be drawn up and presented to
Bush, one administration source said ``there's a sense of urgency
and we want to move quickly and respond quickly.''
   The Agency For International Development, meanwhile, announced
it will reopen its Panama City office. Before it was closed on
Noriega's orders in December 1987, the office had helped Panama
stabilize its economy through development assistance.
   The State Department agency said it is allocating $700,000 in
emergency assistance to remove rubble in the fire-ravaged Panama
City neighborhood of El Chorrillo, care for displaced people and
distribute food and medical supplies.
   The fire damage was widely believed to be caused by Noriega's
paramilitary supporters, known as Dignity Battalions.
   One U.S. official, who, like the others, requested anonymity,
said it also is likely the administration will move up from March
the date on which officials must certify whether Panama is
cooperating in antidrug efforts.
   By speeding up the evaluation, the administration could enable
Panama to receive U.S. trade benefits and Caribbean Basin
Initiative benefits and have its sugar quota reinstated, that
official said.
   The embryonic, U.S.-installed government of President Guillermo
Endara has expressed strong antidrug sentiments and would be
expected to win certification, said the official. Such
certification was denied to Panama under Noriega, now in U.S.
custody on a variety of drug charges.
   ``The revitalization of the Panamanian economy is a major
priority in the months ahead,'' Bush told a White House news
conference, ``as are our efforts for humanitarian assistance.
   ``I can report today that considerable progress has been made so
far in returning Panama to a normal state of affairs. The new
government has taken charge, and President Endara is working
tirelessly to meet the needs of his people.''
   Bush said the team led by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger that visited Panama this week had praised the Endara
government.
   ``They are discussing housing programs, business development,
bank loans that will help spur economic growth. We are committed to
be a part of that process,'' Bush said.
   The president noted that he already has released nearly $400
million in assets in U.S. banks that was frozen under the sanctions
against the Noriega regime.
   U.S. officials involved in the discussions with Panama said
Endara did not present a laundry list of economic requests, but
rather talked about general needs.
   ``The Endara government has to sort out its priorities,'' said
one official, who also requested anonymity.
   Just how much money the administration might find to help Panama
is an unanswered question. Bush's press secretary, Marlin
Fitzwater, acknowledged this week that the current 1991 budget, to
be sent to Congress on Jan. 29, includes no money to help Panama.
   The Endara government indicated to the Eagleburger team that it
recognizes that private businesses in Panama will play a major role
in restoring the economy and does not expect the U.S. governement
to do everything, said one source.
   It is expected the administration will turn to friends around
the world to help Panama. In particular, officials have mentioned
Japan.
   Japanese ambassador Ryohei Murata discussed the matter Friday
with Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Afterward, Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith, said he
could not disclose the substance of the discussion other than to
say, ``The vice president complimented Japan for considering
extending aid.''
   Japan retained its ties with the Noriega government despite U.S.
urgings that the Tokyo government help isolate the dictator. Japan
has had substantial economic interests in Panama.

   Heating oil futures prices plunged more than 5 cents a gallon
for the second straight day Friday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as warm temperatures in the Northeast flushed speculators
from the market.
   On other commodity markets, orange juice futures rebounded
strongly; precious metals were sharply higher; pork futures surged
while cattle futures were mixed; and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Wholesale home heating oil futures settled 2.27 cents to 5.36
cents lower with the contract for delivery in February at 67.83
cents a gallon.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished 33 cents to 58 cents
lower with February at 23.08 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
2 cents to 3.07 cents lower with February at 62.22 cents a gallon.
   The sell-off in the energy markets extended a move begun
Thursday, reflecting a full-scale retreat by speculators who bought
in during last month's dramatic, weather-driven rally.
   A warming trend that roughly coincided with the beginning of the
new year has reduced heating-oil demand and eased the strain on oil
refineries, analysts said.
   But the key to the collapse appears to have been the market's
reluctance to rally Thursday after the American Petroleum Institute
released weekly inventory figures showing larger-than-expected
declines in U.S. stocks of gasoline and petroleum distillates,
which include heating oil.
   ``When the market negated that, you had your classic commodities
downturn with everybody wanting to get out at the same time, and it
was ugly,'' said analyst Jerry Samuels of Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   Orange juice futures prices soared the permitted daily limit on
the New York Cotton Exchange, more than offsetting Thursday's
losses, amid new concerns about frost damage to the Florida orange
groves.
   The market seems to have factored in all the damage done to the
oranges. But new fears have surfaced that the Christmas weekend
freeze and subsequent warmup may have hurt the trees, too, which
could adversely affect next year's crop.
   ``The assessment from Florida is that the situation is a lot
more critical than we anticipated before,'' said Celeste Georkakis,
an analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc.
   An Agriculture Department crop report due out on Thursday is not
expected to indicate the full extent of the damage, she said.
   All contracts for future deliveries of frozen concentrated
orange juice rose the 5-cent limit except the limitless January
contract, which settled 8.65 cents higher at $1.7965 a pound.
   Gold futures rallied strongly on New York's Commodity Exchange,
extending gains posted Thursday and entirely erasing the losses
registered on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Analysts cited a resurgence of bullion sales, possibly
indicating a ``flight to safety'' by investors spooked by the sharp
drop in stock prices around the world Friday following news that
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev had canceled meetings with foreign
leaders.
   Gold settled $7.70 to $7.80 higher with February at $408.50 a
troy ounce; silver was 5 cents to 5.1 cents higher with February at
$5.344 a troy ounce.
   Pork futures rose sharply for the second straight day on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange in response to Wednesday's Agriculture
Department report showing a smaller-than-expected U.S. hog herd.
   Live hogs settled .45 cent to the limit 1.5 cents higher with
February at 50.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.1 cents
to the limit 2 cents higher with February at 53.47 cents a pound;
live cattle futures finished .20 cent lower to .15 cent higher with
February at 76.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent lower
to .05 cent higher with January at 84.57 cents a pound.
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures settled unchanged
to 1 cent higher with March at $4.09} a bushel; corn was \ cent to
} cent lower with March at $2.37} a bushel; oats were { cent to 1{

   Prices of long-term government bonds sank Friday
on new inflation fears and a government employment report that
apparently offered no hope of lower interest rates.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell \ point, or
$2.50 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield rose to 8.06
percent from 8.03 percent late Thursday.
   Shorter-term Treasury yields were mixed.
   The credit markets had little initial reaction to a Labor
Department report that the unemployment held steady at 5.3 percent
in December as gains in service industries offset the ninth
consecutive monthly drop in manufacturing jobs.
   But after receiving no signal from the Federal Reserve Board on
the future course of monetary policy, traders began to sell bonds
in the long end of the market.
   Traders have been hopeful that in order to spur economic growth
the Fed would lower interest rates, which makes bonds more valuable
and raises their prices. But recent reports have pointed to some
strength in the economy, which could cause inflation and discourage
the Fed from easing credit _ bad news for bonds.
   ``The employment data indicated clearly the economy is clearly
slowing but there were some indication that wage inflation is
beginning to pick up,'' said economist Steven A. Wood at
BankAmerica Capital Markets in San Francisco.
   The government said average hourly earnings rose 0.6 percent,
translating into annual gains more than 7 percent, well above the
4.1 percent over the past year.
   Sharp rises in oil prices earlier this week also have renewed
inflation fears, Wood said. Prices of crude and home heating oil
fell on Thursday and Friday, giving back some of their sharp gains
from earlier in the week.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, short-term
government issues were unchanged to up 3-32 point, intermediate
issues were unchanged to down 1-16 point and long-term issues were
down 3-32 point to 11-32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a
financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.34 to 1,184.60.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills declined to 7.77 percent as
the discount fell 3 basis points to 7.53 percent. Yields on
six-month bills fell to 7.84 percent as the discount dropped 1
basis point to 7.45 percent. Yields on one-year bills slipped to
7.77 percent as the discount lost 2 basis points to 7.27 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8&lsqb; percent, down from 8\ percent late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was 93 1-16, down &lsqb;. The average yield to
maturity rose to 7.28 percent from 7.27 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Cold Weather Sends Oil Prices To Four-Year High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Domestic oil prices, driven by falling
temperatures and rising demand, have hit the highest level in four
years, already topping what many petroleum industry analysts had
expected as a peak for 1990.
   Many said the Wednesday surge to levels approaching $24 a barrel
for February delivery of West Texas Intermediate crude oil probably
couldn't last long. Nonetheless, they were busy revising their
forecasts for the year.
   ``At the 20 bucks that we saw in November, I forecast a trail
off to $17 or $18 by April, and then I expected things to recover
in the balance of the year,'' said Stephen A. Smith, an analyst at
Bear Stearns &amp; Co. in New York.
   ``Now it won't go a lot lower than 19 bucks,'' he said Friday.
Others were looking for a drop of about $2 to $3 per barrel.
   After Wednesday's high of $23.68, the price fell back 27 cents
on Thursday and 33 cents Friday to close the week at $23.08, vs.
$21.50 a week earlier.
   The so-called posted price, what refiners are willing to pay for
immediate delivery, also jumped $1.50 during the week to $22.50,
before some refiners began pulling back to $22 late Friday.
   Except for a one-day jump last April, the levels were the
highest since 1986, when oil prices began to fall from the high
$20s before bottoming out in the $10 per barrel range.
   The runup was caused by a number of things but mainly cold
weather in the Northeast and in Europe.
   George Gaspar, analyst at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. in Milwaukee,
said the weather, coupled with problems at domestic refineries,
reduced finished product stocks by 30 million barrels, forcing
refineries to rush to restock and get ready for the summer gasoline
season.
   ``Generally there's a steady decline in finished product _ light
fuel, gasoline _ through March, but we're far and above ahead of
the decline,'' he said.
   Analysts said the demand for crude oil to replenish the stock
likely will keep the price from falling rapidly, although they
expect a decline before prices climb again toward the end of the
year, perhaps to $24 a barrel.
   For consumers, the recent jump in oil prices already has made a
stiff impact, especially for users of home-heating oil. Gasoline
users haven't faced a dramatic rise at the pump yet, but airline
passengers are getting socked with fuel surcharges, the first time
that's happened since the 1970s oil crises.
   Some industry analysts say the sudden surge in demand for oil
has revived respect for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, a key source of supplies. Only a few months ago when
OPEC decided on a combined production level of about 22 million
barrels a day, many analysts thought that was too much and would
depress prices. But now that level seems about right.
   ``The weather may have bailed OPEC out a bit here,'' said Smith
of Bear Stearns.
   Others said increased international demand, especially in Brazil
and Japan, had soaked up any excess supplies.
   Even if the price retreats, the domestic industry's recovery
from the price collapse a few years ago should continue, said David
Lee Smith, analyst at Eppler, Guerin &amp; Turner Inc. in Dallas.
   ``My sense is that most of the major oil companies test their
projects at $15 a barrel,'' he said. ``If they become convinced as
time goes on that we've got stable prices above that, it bodes well
for the continuing recovery.''
   Many of the major oil companies already plan to increase
spending on exploration this year, and new technology is helping
revive fields once thought to be dry.
   The increased prices carry some danger, warned Lysle Brinker,
editor of Petroleum Outlook, in that they could persuade OPEC to
increase quotas at its spring meeting. More oil would send prices
back down, he said.

<TEXT>
   Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr. on
Friday denied ``with all my heart and soul'' that he used a
tax-sharing arrangement at his Lincoln Savings and Loan Association
to siphon off $94 million.
   The arrangement between the now-collapsed Irvine, Calif., thrift
and its holding company, American Continental Corp., is a
centerpiece of regulators' contention that Keating was illegally
using Lincoln as a ``piggybank'' for his massive real estate
ventures.
   Testifying on his suit seeking to overturn the government's
takeover of the $6 billion thrift last April as an ``unsafe and
unsound'' institution, Keating said the tax arrangement was
intended only to bring stability to the various subsidiaries of his
empire.
   ``To me it was a housekeeping situation,'' he told U.S. District
Court Judge Stanley Sporkin in his second day of testimony.
   A key figure in the S&amp;L crisis and the target of a criminal
grand jury investigation, Keating had refused in November to
testify before the House Banking Committee about Lincoln and its
alleged loss of up to $2 billion in federally insured deposits.
   He also is at the center of a Senate ethics investigation after
raising $1.3 million for the political causes of five senators who
intervened with regulators on Lincoln's behalf in 1987 when
examiners then were trying to curtail its risky loans and land and
junk bond investments.
   After his court appearance, Keating told reporters that the
government failed to justify Lincoln's takeover in seven days of
hearings presenting its side to Sporkin.
   ``To me it's obvious they have not made a case,'' he said. ``Now
our turn starts. They took away an association with $5.5 billion in
assets and they're supposed to have had some reason for doing that.
This company made money. In my opinion it was well managed (and)
... would have survived under proper handling by the regulators.''
   Attorneys for Keating said it would take them at least eight
days to present his case to Sporkin, who held the top legal posts
at the Securities and Exchange Commission and CIA before becoming a
judge.
   In response to skeptical questions from Sporkin, Keating
acknowledged that that he used part of the deferred taxes American
Continental was holding on behalf of the thrift to make payments on
the holding company's debt.
   But when the judge asked if that was the purpose of the
arrangement _ to use Lincoln ``as a piggybank for you and American
Continental'' _ Keating said no.
   ``With all my heart and soul, I want you to know that I
categorically deny that I had any concept remotely related to
that,'' he said.
   The tax agreement is one of several arrangements in which the
government contends savers' government-insured deposits in Lincoln
disappeared.
   Using the accord, regulators contend, Lincoln would sell land it
had bought at greatly inflated prices, financing the buyers
entirely, to record huge paper profits. Then using money from
depositors, it would send the future taxes on those profits to
American Continental, the government contends.
   From 1985 through 1988, the holding company collected $94
million in such deferred taxes from Lincoln although none of it was
ever paid to the government.
   Keating also admitted Friday that Lincoln's bookkeeping hid the
true buyer in one 1,000-acre soured real estate deal in which $4.4
million of allegedly owed taxes was paid by Lincoln to American
Continental on a $14 million sale.
   However, because he knew who the true buyer was and that a $3.5
million down payment was made on property that Lincoln had bought
for $3 million, regulators had no reason to be concerned about it,
he said.
   ``The essence of the problem is that the regulators didn't like
land syndications,'' Keating said, explaining that the use of
``straw buyers'' as the title holder were common in such deals.
   Sporkin, questioned how ``you can manage billion-dollar
businesses and have transactions where the paperwork did not
reflect what took place?''
   ``When you run a bank or a savings and loan, you have the
highest responsibility of anyone because you're not dealing just
with stockholders, you're dealing with people's savings,'' the
judge told Keating. ``... The only way regulators (can ensure that
an institution is being run properly) is if the books and records
accurately reflect transactions.''
   In its takeover and a $1.1 billion civil racketeering and fraud
suit the government has filed against Keating, the government has
charged the entire deal was a sham.
   The true buyer, Arizona developer Ernest C. Garcia, had received
another $20 million loan from Lincoln the same day. And regulators
contend that Garcia used some of that money or proceeds from other
loans and deals with Lincoln to make the 25 percent, $3.5 million
down payment necessary under accounting regulations for the thrift
to record the profit.
   Garcia, who was a participant in several interwoven deals with
Lincoln and American Continental that the government contends
establishes a pattern of fraud and racketeering, refused Friday to
testify as a government witness in Keating's suit.
   Through his attorney, Garcia claimed a Fifth Amendment
protection from self-incrimination and Sporkin allowed him to leave
the courtroom without ever taking the stand.

   Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. won a reprieve
Friday as the Western Australian Supreme Court dismissed a
government petition to liquidate the media, brewing, natural
resources and property empire.
   The court ruled against the State Government Insurance
Commission, which had asked the court to appoint a provisional
liquidator for Bond Corp. on the grounds that the company
controlled by financier Alan Bond was insolvent.
   A judge ruled that the insurance commission had failed to prove
its claim.
   ``There is no evidence that the creditors of (Bond Corp.) aren't
being paid,'' the judge said.
   The future of Bond Corp. may be uncertain, the judge said, but a
petition should not be filed on speculation ``that a company may
possibly at some time in the future experience severe financial
difficulties.''
   He also ruled that a nearly $668,000 debt that was the basis of
the petition was disputed by Bond Corp.
   Bond Corp. Executive Director Peter Lucas called the court
decision ``a resounding victory'' for the company.
   While Bond Corp. succeeded on one front, the company, whose
debts total $5.6 billion, was still battling in another court to
overturn an order to appoint receivers and managers to its
Australian brewing units.
   The company is also trying to negotiate with U.S. holders of
debentures issued by its Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd. unit who have
demanded immediate repayment of $510 million of the securities and
overdue interest.
   Lawyers for the debenture holders said in court here Friday they
intend to support continuation of receivers appointed last month to
operate Bond's brewing units.
   The court appointed the receivers at the request of a syndicate
of international banks led by National Australia Bank Ltd.
   U.S. noteholders were due to receive a $32.19 million interest
payment from Bond's brewing arm, but the courts froze that payment
at the request of the bank syndicate. Bond Brewing has asked the
court to lift the bank's stop-payment notice.
   Alan Bond, who controls about 58 percent of Bond Corp., gained
virtual hero status in Australia when he won the 1983 America's Cup
yachting trophy. The millionaire industrialist has been selling
assets in recent months to reduce debt.
   In its fiscal year ended June 30, Bond Corp. lost 980.2 million
Australian dollars, the largest annual loss in Australian corporate
history.
   Bond Corp.'s G. Heileman Brewing Co. unit in the United States
so far is not involved in the receivership proceedings.
   Heileman spokesman Bill Eiler said in a telephone interview from
Pittsburgh Thursday the U.S. brewer has separate financing from
Bond Corp. and as a matter of policy does not comment on matters
involving Bond.
   Bond purchased La Crosse, Wis.-based Heileman in 1987 for about
$1.3 billion and reportedly still owes about $850 million after
selling the profitable Heileman Baking Co. and other Heileman
subsidiaries.
   Heileman officials said recently they have been meeting with
creditors and reviewing alternatives ``aimed at favorably modifying
Heileman's existing debt structure.''
   Separately, Adolph Coors Co., the fourth-largest U.S. brewing
company, acknowledged this week it has held talks with Heileman for
over a year about the possible purchase of the Wisconsin brewer.

<HEAD>More Flexible Scheduling, Job Sharing and Home Work Expected in
1990s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flexible work schedules will become more
commonplace during the 1990s, along with job sharing and work at
home, according to a survey released Sunday.
   The Conference Board, a business-supported research
organization, said it surveyed 521 of the nation's biggest
companies, and found that 93 percent offer at least one kind of
flexible staffing.
   The most common form of flexible staffing was part-time work,
followed by flexible hours, job sharing, phased retirement and work
at home, the Conference Board said. Some companies also offer
shorter work weeks.
   Companies expect to make greater use of flexible staffing in the
next few years, the survey said. Job sharing and work at home are
most likely to be under consideration.
   However, while many firms are considering more flexible
staffing, the employees who currently benefit the most from such
arrangements tend to be women in clerical, administrative support
or sales positions. Managers, professionals and executives
generally do not have flexible schedules, the Conference Board said.
   Kathleen Christensen, a City University of New York professor
who compiled the study, said companies are coming under pressure to
offer flexible staffing because of the tight labor market.
   ``In the 1990s, flexible scheduling will be a critical issue to
companies that need to keep their most valued employees and retain
a competitive edge in recruitment,'' she said.

<HEAD>Travelers, Aetna Wary of Insurance for Individuals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Travelers Corp., citing poor financial
results, says it plans to stop selling major medical health
insurance to individuals, and another insurance giant, Aetna Life &amp;
Casualty, is considering a similar move.
   Travelers spokeswoman Rosanne Hennessey said Thursday the
company will honor and extend existing individual policies, but
will not sell new major medical policies to individuals after Jan.
31. Major medical policies pay hospital and doctor costs.
   Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. said Thursday it is considering
withdrawing from the individual health insurance market or reducing
its individual health insurance business.
   Neither Aetna nor Travelers is a major seller of individual
health insurance. Both companies concentrate on health insurance
sold to employers for their workers.
   Aetna, for instance, wrote $18 billion worth of insurance
polices in 1988, of which 1 percent _ $180 million _ was for
individuals.
   Hennessey said the major medical program for individuals has not
generated the profits the company expected.
   ``Claims and expenses exceeded premiums and exceeded our
expectations,'' she said.
   She stressed that Travelers will continue to offer other types
of individual policies, including long-term disability, long-term
care, accidental death and business travel and hospital indemnity.
   Aetna said it has not decided what steps to take regarding its
individual policies. John J. Martin, president of the company's
personal financial security division, said the options include
making no changes or withdrawing certain lines of individual
insurance.
   Martin complained that the individual policy business is ``very
unpredictable, very volatile,'' and that it has been ``an
inconsistent performer.''
   He said Aetna lost about $9 million on individual policies in
1987, made about $5 million in 1988, and that 1989 ``is going to be
a modest loser.''
   Aetna has found that people who buy individual policies tend to
be more likely to have health problems resulting in claims, Martin
said. He said insurers prefer group insurance because it covers a
broad spectrum of employees, people of different ages, sexes and
states of health.
   In addition, he said, Aetna is worried that insurance
regulations, concerned about the affordability of insurance, may
approve rates that are too low to make such insurance profitable in
the future.

   Microsoft Corp.'s Windows computer
software will be installed on as many as 40,000 personal computers
being purchased by the Federal Aviation Administration over the
next eight years, Microsoft said Thursday.
   Microsoft is a subcontractor to AT&amp;T in the contract with the
federal Department of Transportation, which oversees the FAA. But
the Redmond-based company said its participation was crucial in
selection of the AT&amp;T bid for the air control agency's Office
Automation Technology Services contract.
   ``We believe the FAA made its selection based in large part on
the clear and demonstrable productivity increases that users
realize when working in the Windows environment,'' said Bill Gates,
chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft. ``This award
signals (the government's) recognition of Windows as a complete
solution for increased productivity.''
   The Transportation Department awarded the contract, potentially
worth $853 million, to AT&amp;T last month. The value of the
subcontract to Microsoft was not disclosed.
   Windows and two other Microsoft products, Excel for Windows and
Word for Windows, were included in the bids. Excel is a spreadsheet
program and Word is for word processing.
   Windows provides a graphical, or picture, display to manipulate
the software, rather than requiring users to type in characters to
operate the software.
   Seventy companies worked with AT&amp;T on the contract bid,
Microsoft said.
