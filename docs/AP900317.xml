   An F-16A jet fighter crashed Friday near
the Nevada line, and pilot was able to eject safely, authorities
said.
   The aircraft, known as a ``Flight Phantom 18,'' went down on the
western Utah Salt Flats three miles east of Wendover at about 9:30
a.m., said Tooele County Sheriff's Sgt. Joe Bradshaw.
   The pilot, the only person aboard the $16 million plane, was
identified as Capt. Dan West, 32, of Shelton, Wash. West, assigned
to Hill Air Force Base, was taken to Wendover Air Base for
debriefing.
   Hill crews were dispatched to the crash scene, authorities said.
   Mitch Barker, a spokesman with the Federal Aviation
Administration in Seattle, said he understood the pilot ejected
after the aircraft's engine failed.
   The F-16A was en route to Wendover from Hill Air Force Base when
it crashed, Barker said.
   Hill officials said the aircraft had undergone maintenance at
the northern Utah base and took off at 8:55 a.m. for a test flight.

   One of China's largest blast furnaces collapsed
in an iron and steel mill in a northwest province, killing 19
people and injuring 10, an official daily said today.
   Officials were investigating Monday's disaster at the Jiuquan
Iron and Steel Company in Gansu province, the People's Daily said.
   Metallurgical Industry Minister Qi Yuanjing led rescue and fire
control operations, the daily said. The furnace, constructed during
the Great Leap Forward period of rapid industrialization in 1958,
was one of the largest in China, it said.
   The report gave no further details.

   Pastor Christian Fuehrer, whose St.
Nicholas Church was the birthplace of the ``candlelight
revolution,'' is disheartened the rebellion unleased nationalist
fervor and a chase for Western riches.
   ``The Coca Cola culture is taking over, and people are rushing
blindly to exchange one set of chains for another,'' the
47-year-old Lutheran minister said in a recent interview in his
apartment overlooking the downtown church.
   As he spoke, dozens of Western vendors in nearby Karl Marx
Square were selling goods like ice cream and bananas for inflated
prices. At other stalls, West German activists campaigning for
their East German sister parties in Sunday's election were handing
out glossy stickers.
   Later that day, about 300,000 people jammed the square to hear
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl deliver campaign promises of
``affluence for all'' in a united Germany. ``Helmut, Helmut,''
chanted the supporters, waving hundreds of West German flags.
   Only five months ago, such scenes would have been unthinkable in
this industrial city of 565,000, about 125 miles southwest of
Berlin.
   In early October, the Communists still held a tight grip on the
country, but the widespread dissatisfaction fomenting for years was
beginning to bubble to the surface.
   Discontent was especially strong in polluted and rundown
Leipzig, and the city took the lead in the revolt.
   The spark came from the St. Nicholas Church, where the
jeans-clad minister for years had provided refuge and meeting space
for dissidents. Every Monday night, anti-government ``peace
prayers'' took place at the Lutheran church.
   The prayers usually drew a few hundred people. But on Oct. 9,
thousands flocked to the church, angered by the repression of a
pro-democracy protest two days earlier.
   After that Monday's prayers, 70,000 demonstrators chanting ``We
are the people!'' marched through Leipzig in the largest public
protest held in 40 years of totalitarian rule.
   Other cities joined in, and eventually the old Communist leaders
were toppled. A Communist-led caretaker government opened the
borders on Nov. 9 and scheduled elections for Sunday.
   ``It's still hard to understand how Christ's spirit of
non-violence took hold of these people, most of whom are not
Christians,'' said Fuehrer, a minister's son who often quotes Marx.
   ``They had lived through 40 years of Marxism and atheism, and
they behaved as if they had grown up with the Sermon on the
Mount,'' said Fuehrer. ``This was the highlight of my life.''
   Fuehrer said the Lutheran Church, the only institution not
controlled by the Communists, did not initiate the uprising but
made it possible. ``My role was to keep the church door open,'' he
said.
   After the heady days of October, when thousands jammed into the
church, St. Nicholas is empty again.
   One recent day, only about 50 people came to hear Pastor Arndt
Haubold's thoughts on the upcoming elections. The sermon turned out
to be a subtle endorsement of ``Alliance 90,'' a group of mainly
left-wing dissidents who were at the forefront of the struggle who
are not expected to score big in the election.
   Most of the listeners were elderly women, the traditional church
audience before the revolt.
   ``It's pretty bad that we don't have more people here,'' said
22-year-old chemistry student Karsten Bigl, one of the early
activists last year. He acknowledged he had attended only because
he happened to pass on a shopping trip.
   Bigl said he felt betrayed by his fellow East Germans, who are
becoming increasingly hostile toward left-wing groups that want to
prevent a merger with West Germany or slow down the pace.
   ``The people who started everything are already being denounced
as `red pigs,''' said Bigl.
   Many East Germans, who long have yearned for the affluence
presented to them nightly on West German television and felt like
beggars peeping through the palace window, see quick unification as
the sure ticket for catching up.
   But Fuehrer warned that East Germans must first deal with their
tainted past, noting that millions of people had belonged to the
Communist Party or collaborated with the secret police.
   ``We need time for shame and remorse,'' said Fuehrer.
   Fuehrer said he foresees difficult times for the church.
   ``The coming affluence will be a much more formidable opponent
than Marxism, because people are dancing voluntarily around the
golden calf,'' he said.
   But he added with a wink: ``We have lived through 40 years of
socialism, and we will also survive German unity.''

   A high school teacher fired a starter's
pistol in an attempt to control noisy students in his classroom,
officials said.
   ``It got them quiet,'' Superintendent Earl W. Brakken said
Friday.
   No one was injured and the gun contained only blanks, Brakken
said.
   Brakken said the teacher, whose name was not released, pointed
the starter's pistol Thursday afternoon at a junior to quiet the
class at Kettle Moraine High School in southern Wisconsin.
   The teacher, who was out of town Friday, had not been suspended,
Brakken said.
   But Brakken said he would meet with the teacher Sunday to
determine if the school should take any disciplinary action.
   The Waukesha County Sheriff's Department also launched an
investigation Friday after it received a complaint from a student's
parent, Inspector Gary Paluszcyk said.

   Alexander Yakovlev, a member of the Congress of
People's Deputies, pronounced himself satisfied with the pace of
democracy's development in the Soviet Union.
   Democracy ``is just rising from the cradle'' in the Communist
state, said Yakovlev, a key adviser to President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and a lawyer who has been studying Western constitutions
in preparation for writing a new one for the Soviet Union. ``This
baby works very well, considering his age and not-very-good family
tradition.''
   ``Look at the public, how attentively they watch, how they
absorb what's going on politically,'' he said.
   Indeed, after the first session of Congress a year ago was
broadcast live, the government announced that henceforth the
proceedings would be recorded and shown on national television only
after working hours. It seems the nation's productivity, not
something bragged about in the best of times, plummeted 20 percent
during the televised debates.
   Undeterred, Soviets gathered last week around their televisions
every night to watch their fledgling congress fumble through the
birth of a government of laws. The hours of often tedious
procedural wrangling were among the most popular shows in the
country.

   Told the West has been impressed with his country's recent
moves, the youth shook his head.
   ``You don't understand,'' he said. ``Everything is still decided

   Skeptics watched one floor fight after another result in defeat
for progressive deputies trying to buck Gorbachev's iron will. Less
apparent to the public was the work of the reformers who struggled
in committee and won limitations on what they saw as potentially
dictatorial powers Gorbachev originally sought.
   But the outcome was not long in doubt. Gorbachev's presidential
campaign lasted 2{ hours. He was the sole candidate and never made
a campaign speech. When both men nominated to run against him
refused to do so, deputies tried to force them to stay in the race
to give it at least the appearance of a competitive election.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The one-man race was not, however, a mere excuse to venerate the
leader as it would have been in earlier days. Some deputies seized
the opportunity to express their anger and frustration.
   A group of deputies representing agrarian interests went to the
podium to nominate Gorbachev, apparently because they wanted the
floor to raise ``a number of sore points,'' as their delegate put
it.
   A deputy in military uniform demanded Gorbachev not be made
commander-in-chief of the armed forces without at least taking a
few lessons in military strategy. He hinted that the superpower
leader really ought to go back and serve the obligatory military
service he somehow escaped in a land where practically all young
men are drafted.
   The deputy, practicing a bit of pork barrel politics for his
military constituency, also demanded Gorbachev give apartments to
every veteran by May 9, the national holiday marking the Soviets'
victory over the Nazis.
   ``Should Mikhail Sergeyevich become a czar, it would not change
the situation,'' said taxi driver Leonid Sukhov, a deputy who first
captured the world's attention when he compared Gorbachev to
Napoleon under the spell of a Josephine _ his wife, Raisa.
   ``People in my region get seven grams of butter and 20 grams of
sausage a day,'' said a delegate from Perm. ``Food is being
rationed, and I protest the praise being lavished on our leaders!''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev sat stone-faced through it all.
   He did have a few moments of enjoyment, however, when a Kazakh
deputy suggested Gorbachev be elected president because ``he still
remembers what the wheel of a combine looks like.''
   The Soviet leader grew up in a farm village in southern Russia
and worked with his father as a combine operator before winning a
coveted place as a student at Moscow State University.
   And perhaps he could find faint praise in the speech of another
deputy.
   The fierce and fiery Anna Kanarovskaya was positively snarling
when she stomped to the podium and said, ``Khrushchev banged his
shoe on the table, Brezhnev had his speeches written for him and
nearly lost his artificial teeth.''
   ``We always appear ridiculous before the world,'' she said.
``For the first time, I'm not ashamed.''

   The only frolicking the federal
government wants on a nude beach in Rhode Island is by a small
group of birds whose existence is considered threatened.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has decided that the secluded
and popular Moonstone Beach will be off-limits for nude sunbathers
this summer in order to protect the tiny piping plover.
   Moonstone has been the only spot on the 420-mile Rhode Island
coast _ and one of few along the New England shore _ where nudists
can sun in the buff.
   But federal officials and environmental groups say that when
humans enter, the piping plover exits. The bird is listed on the
federal endangered species list as threatened, a step away from the
designation of endangered.
   ``The human activity serves as a distraction to the plovers,''
said James Kurth, manager of the Trustom Pond National Wildlife
Refuge, which includes Moonstone Beach. ``They're constantly moved
away from their breeding grounds.'' He cited a University of
Massachusetts study more than a decade ago that showed plovers will
leave an area where humans congregate.
   Nudists see the battle over the bird as a subterfuge to the
underlying issue: They claim the government wants Northeastern
shores free of nude sunbathers.
   They also say they can coexist with the little bird _ and, in
fact, have for years.
   ``It doesn't have anything to do with the animal unless the
people are bothering them,'' said Ron LaPorte of Glastonbury,
Conn., as he lounged on a blanket on the sun-drenched beach
Thursday morning. He was bundled in a denim jacket against a sea
breeze.
   ``Birds are important, but the public is important, too,'' said
Dave Gillis of Warrensville, Conn., also sunning himself on the
beach. ``We paid for this beach. ... They've got to consider the
people.''
   The controversy over Moonstone has been simmering for years. But
when the Fish and Wildlife Service expanded its holdings in 1982,
nudists and clothed beachgoers began to feel a little more
unwelcome.
   For one thing, their beach kept shrinking.
   In 1982, the federal government obtained land from the Audubon
Society and took control of about a mile of the coast, Kurth said.
The following summer, about three-quarters of a mile was closed. A
fence erected last year left a thin strip along the water's edge
for sunbathers.
   This year, when the plovers come back around the last week of
March, that fence will go to the high tide mark along the entire
length of beach to keep sunbathers _ clothed and naked _ out.
   ``We're applauding them very loudly,'' said Alfred Hawkes,
executive director of the Audubon Society. Hawkes said his group
had objected to the nude sunbathers, but had been unable to keep
them out.
   Hawkes said the sandy strip of coast appears to be ideally
suited to plovers, so tiny that adults reach only 7\ inches. On one
side lies the blue expanse of ocean. Beyond sand dunes on the other
side is the freshwater Trustom Pond.
   In the early 1970s, piping plovers and least terns were nesting
there regularly, Hawkes said. ``It got pretty much out of hand in
the late '70s. Once the word got around among nudists the crowd
grew very quickly.''
   Nudists said they are being branded unfairly as anti-bird.
   ``There seems to be some bias functioning here, although it's
denied by officials,'' said Lee Baxandall of Osh Kosh, Wis.,
president of the nationwide Naturist Society. ``There is no federal
law against nudity.''

<HEAD>Mitchell Criticizes Bush Comment on East Jerusalem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell is
labeling President Bush's comment on Jewish settlers in East
Jerusalem a ``heavy-handed blunder'' that jeopardizes the Middle
East peace process.
   In a harsh statement issued Friday, Mitchell charged that Bush's
statement two weeks ago represented ``thoughtless insensitivity or
conscious provocation'' and hastened the downfall of Israel's
coalition government.
   ``A more heavy-handed blunder is difficult to imagine,'' said
Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Bush, at a news conference March 3 in Palm Springs, Calif.,
listed East Jerusalem as among the areas where the United States
wants to see an end to new Israeli settlements.
   The administration says the president's statement was consistent
with longstanding U.S. policy, which holds that the Israeli
settlements in occupied territory add to tensions and are
detrimental to peace efforts. And Bush earlier this week dismissed
suggestions that his remark had contributed to Israel's current
political crisis.
   But recent U.S. policy statements have focused on settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza strip, not mentioning East Jerusalem. Bush's
comment gave new visibility to the disputed area.
   Mitchell said the remarks ``cast doubt upon America's intentions
and role in promoting peace in the Middle East.''
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said
Friday that the turmoil in Israel meant ``obviously there is a
pause in moving the peace process forward.''
   But she added that Thursday's vote in the Israeli parliament to
dissolve the government was being read by the administration as ``a
focus on the peace issue and the importance of moving forward.''
   Tutwiler added: ``We recognize that this is a delicate time in
Israel and we look forward to working closely with the Israeli
government that emerges. ... We will continue to work together to
bring peace to this region.''
   In his statement, Mitchell gave the administration credit for
investing much time and energy in encouraging Israel to accept a
proposal to hold elections among Palestinians in the occupied
territories.
   ``There had been a process of building confidence and enhancing
trust among all parties,'' Mitchell said. ``President Bush's
comments have undermined that progress. Trust is easily shattered.
Confidence can quickly evaporate.''
   Mitchell added: ``There was simply no reason to suddenly thrust
into the forefront of debate the issue of Jewish Israelis' rights
to live in East Jerusalem.
   ``Certainly the status of East Jerusalem must be decided as part
of a negotiated comprehensive peace. But the president's comments
served no purpose but to impede progress toward establishing the
very process needed to resolve this issue.''
   Mitchell's criticism came as many activist Democrats on Capitol
Hill are expressing restiveness over their leadership's failure to
take Bush on more directly and forcefully at a time when the
president is enjoying high popularity ratings in the polls.
   But an aide to Mitchell said the comments were meant simply to
register clear disagreement with Bush over the East Jerusalem
statement, and not to quiet any grumbling among congressional
Democrats.

   Oliver North was so self-assured he sat in
President Reagan's chair when answering questions from lawmakers at
a meeting he has testified he attended reluctantly, according to
testimony at the trial of his former boss, John Poindexter.
   Poindexter _ who is charged with obstructing and lying to
lawmakers _ didn't trust Congress and preferred to have as little
as possible to do with the legislative branch of government,
another witness testified.
   Friday's testimony by two former White House aides focused on an
Aug. 6, 1986, meeting in which North lied to House intelligence
committee members by denying he was assisting the Contras
militarily.
   North walked into the White House Situation Room and ``the only
vacant seat was for the president,'' so North sat there, testified
Robert Pearson, a former National Security Council lawyer.
   North admitted in testimony at the trial this week that he lied
when he made the denials about Contra assistance. North said
Poindexter, the national security adviser, sent him to the meeting
even though he had told Poindexter he didn't think it was a good
idea.
   ``You certainly didn't get the impression that when Oliver North
sat in that chair the president usually occupies that he was doing
any dirty work for Admiral Poindexter,'' Richard Beckler,
Poindexter's lawyer, said to Pearson.
   ``I did not get that impression,'' replied Pearson.
   Earlier, Beckler asked Ronald Sable, an NSC legislative liaison,
whether North expressed any reluctance about appearing before the
committee.
   ``No,'' replied Sable.
   Was he nervous? asked Beckler.
   ``Not that I recall,'' said Sable.
   What was North's demeanor? asked Beckler.
   ``Typical Oliver North, positive,'' said Sable.
   Sable testified that ``Oliver North was somebody, if you wanted
something done, he would get it done, but you might not be sure how
he got it done.''
   Poindexter is accused of obstructing Congress and lying to
lawmakers by covering up North's Contra assistance and the U.S.
role in a November 1985 missile shipment to Iran.
   ``Admiral Poindexter was skeptical of the Congress,'' Sable
testified. ``He had not had much to do with Congress and that was
his preference ... that he would just as soon not deal with them.''
   ``He indicated he didn't trust them,'' he said.
   ``What about whether he liked them?'' asked Iran-Contra
prosecutor Howard Pearl.
   ``That fell in the same category,'' said Sable, now a corporate
lobbyist on Capitol Hill.
   Iran-Contra prosecutors said they expect to complete their case
Monday. Their final witnesses will be former House intelligence
committee chairman U.S. Rep. Lee Hamilton and Eric Newsome,
formerly a Senate intelligence committee staffer.

freed last month after 27 years in prison.
   ``We think now is not the time to think of more sanctions but to
think in terms of negotiations and how we can encourage that,'' a
senior U.S. official said Friday as the State Department announced
Baker's trip to Africa.
   Included is a meeting with Mandela in Windhoek, the capital of
Namibia, while Baker is attending ceremonies marking the
independence of Africa's newest nation.
   In Cape Town, Baker will meet with de Klerk, South African
Foreign Minister R.F. Botha, Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu and black
critics of the government.
   ``The purpose of our seeing these gentlemen is to encourage
negotiations, to move as rapidly as possible and to see what we can
do to contribute to that,'' the U.S. official said.
   The South African government announced on Friday, meanwhile,
that it would begin talks with Mandela and exiled leaders of the
African National Congress on April 11.
   ``We're very encouraged by the announcement,'' the Baker aide
said.
   The trip is the first by a secretary of state to Africa in seven
years and the first to South Africa since 1978.
   The official, who briefed reporters under rules that he would
not be identified, praised strides made by both whites and blacks
in South Africa.
   ``The mainstream of the white community has effectively decided
to end apartheid through negotiations with the black majority,'' he
said. ``We think it is very significant.''
   At the same time, the official said, ``we also find it
significant that the leadership of the black majority has
reciprocated this step.''
   That is a change from an attitude of confrontation and a time
when negotiations were never in the picture, he said.
   Randall Robinson, the executive director of TransAfrica,
supported Baker's decision to talk with de Klerk as ``an
opportunity to advance a much-needed dialogue on dismantling of
apartheid.''
   But Robinson, whose black group has campaigned for years against
apartheid in South Africa, objected to President Bush's invitation
to de Klerk to meet with him in the White House ``because of the
symbolic message of support and acceptance it would send.''
   No date has been set for a visit by the South African president.

   Pope John Paul II told an U.S. Jewish group
concerned about anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe that the Roman Catholic Church has a duty to promote
cooperation between Christians and Jews.
   John Paul spoke Friday to members of the American Jewish
Committee, who will be going on to Vienna and then the pope's
native Poland.
   Sholom D. Comay, president of the group, said Jews were
``saddened and profoundly concerned'' by reports of a resurgence of
anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   The pope, speaking in English, said ``it is the task of every
local church to promote cooperation between Christians and Jews.''
   ``As the successor of St. Peter, I have a special concern for
all the churches and am therefore committed to furthering such a
policy throughout the world,'' he said.
   He said cooperation between Christians and Jews will contribute
to the democratic development of Central and Eastern Europe.
   Comay also urged that the Vatican establish formal diplomatic
relations with Israel, but the pope did not address the issue.
   The American Jewish Commitee president said such recognition
would contribute to the peace process and ``send a clear signal to
the entire world that Israel is indeed a fully recognized member of
the international family of nations.''
   The Jewish delegation told reporters they were pleased with the
meeting and hailed the progress in Catholic-Jews relations in
recent decades.
   ``There's been more improvement in relations between Christians
and Jews over the past 25 years than in the first 1,900 years of
Christianity,'' said Rabbi A. James Rudin, interreligious affairs
director of the American Jewish Committee.
   Comay said the pope, after the formal exchange of remarks,
talked about the vigorous Jewish community in Krakow, Poland, when
he was a boy and of his visit to the survivors during his 1987
pilgrimage. Comay said he found the pope's recollections ``very
moving.''

   As Terry Anderson starts his sixth year as a
hostage in Lebanon, friends and family are saying, ``You are not
forgotten, Terry.''
   At a sometimes tearful, sunlit ceremony in Lafayette Park across
the street from the White House on Friday, Anderson's relatives and
fellow journalists begged his captors to release him after five
years in captivity.
   ``I don't want to punish them,'' Peggy Say said, referring to
her brother's captors. ``I don't want to hunt them down. I just
want my brother.''
   President Bush stayed away from the hour-long ceremony filled
with song and prayer, but he talked to reporters about the
hostages, sent Mrs. Say a letter and invited her to the White House
for a half-hour chat. It was the first time he had entertained a
hostage relative since he took office over a year ago.
   The plight of the hostages _ eight Americans among 18 Westerners
_ ``concerns me every day I'm alive,'' the president said, adding
that he has a ``heavy heart'' when he thinks of them.
   ``I intend to keep open lines of communications with all
parties, including Iran, who have influence over hostage-takers,''
Bush said. The hostages are thought to be held by pro-Iranian
Moslem Shiite groups.
   Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was seized on March 16, 1985, in Beirut. His daughter was
born shortly thereafter, and he has never seen her.
   Mrs. Say, who has traveled the world working for her brother's
freedom, said she is ``convinced in my heart that in the coming
weeks we will see the resolution of this crisis.''
   ``I have faith and that is why I am standing here now and Terry
has faith and that is why he is alive today,'' she said.
   Bush refused to embrace Mrs. Say's rosy outlook. ``I don't want
to get the hopes up through a lot of speculation and then have them
dashed down,'' he said.
   Anderson's friends and colleagues expressed frustration at their
inability to change the situation.
   The Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco, who was held for a time in the
same windowless room in Beirut before he was freed in summer 1986,
said Anderson had told him, ```Promise me something, I will not be
forgotten.' ... You are not forgotten, Terry.''
   ``At this point the greatest gift we can give him is to press
on, to not falter, to find an honorable way to get the job done. If
you know Terry, that's what he's thinking, too,'' said Louis D.
Boccardi, president and general manager of The Associated Press.
   Anderson was honored by several of his professional colleagues.
Dan Rather, the CBS anchorman, called the ceremony ``a little
something'' Americans can do for Anderson, and Tom Brokaw, the NBC
television anchor, said he felt rage at Anderson's captors.
   ``We must all be certain that our reservoir of rage never runs
dry but at the same time we must hope that these new trickles of
hope will replace the rage,'' Brokaw said.
   No Greater Love, a Washington-based humanitarian organization,
sponsored the ceremony, one of several observances in honor of
Anderson and other hostages.
   In New York, Anderson's friends and colleagues attended a Mass
at St. Patrick's Cathedral. In Tokyo, the Foreign Correspondents'
Club of Japan honored Anderson, who was assigned to the AP Tokyo
bureau from 1977 to 1981.
   In Beirut, local television stations planned to show a videotape
of Anderson's 4-year-old daughter, Sulome, whom he has never seen.
In the tape, the child shows off her ballet dancing and delivers a
message for her father: ``I love you, Daddy, come home. Please come
home.''
   Besides Anderson, the other U.S. hostages and the dates they
were captured are:
   Thomas Sutherland, dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut, June 9, 1985; Frank Herbert Reed, director of
the Lebanon International School in Beirut, Sept. 12, 1986; Joseph
James Cicippio, acting comptroller of the American University of
Beirut, Sept. 12, 1986; Edward Austin Tracy, author, Oct. 21, 1986;
Jesse Jonathan Turner, visiting professor of mathematics and
computer science at Beirut University College, Jan. 24, 1987;
Robert Polhill, assistant professor of business at Beirut
University College, Jan. 24, 1987; and Alann Steen, journalism
professor at Beirut University College, Jan. 24, 1987.

<HEAD>Source: Contra Rebels Re-Infiltrating Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of armed Contra rebel troops are
defying calls for their demobilization and instead are
re-infiltrating Nicaragua, a government source says.
   The rebels, who still are receiving U.S. food aid, have slipped
back into Nicaragua from their jungle camps along the border with
Honduras since just before the country's Feb. 25 presidential
elections, said the source, who spoke Friday on condition of
anonymity.
   The Bush administration and Nicaraguan President-elect Violeta
Chamorro have repeatedly called on the Contras to disarm and
demobilize.
   U.S. officials believe the recent infiltration has swelled
numbers of rebel troops inside Nicaragua from about 3,500 to as
many as 5,000, said the source, while acknowledging the numbers are
``soft.''
   Authority to spend new funds to support the contras ran out Feb.
28, but the State Department's Agency for International Development
is continuing to provide cash for food to the troops from money
already in the AID pipeline.
   ``We are still, in effect, subsidizing an army inside
Nicaragua,'' said the source, who added that food money was
continuing at a level consistent with 3,500 troops, and not the
increased number.
   In all, some 10,000 Contra rebels are believed to still be under
arms, down from a peak of some 16,000.
   Word of the re-infiltration came as Vice President Dan Quayle on
Friday urged Nicaragua's U.S.-backed rebels to disarm and return
home to help the newly elected government.
   But a rebel leader said such a move hinged on the Sandinista
militia laying down its arms as well.
   ``Now is the time to stop the fighting and begin the peace
process,'' Quayle, just back from a week-long trip to South
America, said at the start of a meeting with three representatives
of the Contras. ``We want to see the demobilization of the
resistance.''
   Chamorro, who is to assume the presidency April 25, is
negotiating the transition with defeated President Daniel Ortega.
   The leader of the Contra delegation said the rebels wanted to
disarm and return home to farm but also wanted assurances the
Sandinista forces would demobilize too.
   ``What we need is total demilitarization,'' said the Contra
representative, known only as Commander Franklin.
   Quayle, who met with Ortega during his South American trip,
conceded that mistrust between the Contras and Sandinistas was
complicating efforts to reach agreement on repatriation of the
rebels.
   ``The Contras don't trust the Sandinistas; the Sandinistas don't
trust the Contras,'' Quayle said. But he also told reporters, ``I
am confident that Daniel Ortega will turn power over to Violeta
Chamorro and our challenge now is to work on the transition so Mrs.
Chamorro will have the best opportunity possible to govern.''
   To that end, Quayle urged Congress to act swiftly on the $300
million Nicaraguan aid package President Bush unveiled Tuesday.
Quayle said the South American leaders with whom he had met
exhibited ``strong support'' for the package and said the
agricultural aid included would quicken efforts to repatriate the
Contras.

<HEAD>FTC to Investigate `Environmentally Friendly' Products</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmental claims for a variety of consumer
products _ from trash bags to hair spray _ are being investigated
by the Federal Trade Commission, which says it will ``vigorously
pursue'' deceptive advertising and packaging.
   FTC Chairman Janet Steiger said Friday the agency has joined a
task force of state attorneys general to determine whether
environmental claims made by the products can be substantiated.
   ``Consumers who buy `environmentally friendly' products in hopes
of bettering the environment cannot themselves judge whether such
products will deliver the promised benefits,'' Ms. Steiger told the
Consumer Federation of America on Friday.
   Many consumer products have appeared in stores over the past
year claiming they benefit the environment. The products range from
``degradable'' plastic trash bags, to ``ozone-friendly'' hair
spray, to diapers said to decompose in landfills.
   No specific companies were named as targets by the FTC.
   The federal action comes as attorneys general from eight states
have been investigating environmental claims on consumer products.
Earlier in the week the task force held meetings in Minneapolis
that attracted representatives from dozens of companies and
environmental organizations.
   ``Adding a flower, the sunshine or a whale to your label is not
enough,'' declared Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III of
Minnesota. Other states involved with the task force are Texas,
Massachusetts, Missouri, Wisconsin, California, New York and
Washington.
   Various environmental groups have said the environment-oriented
marketing claims often are misleading.
   Earlier this week, the environmental group Greenpeace released a
report saying that claims about plastic items such as trash bags
and diapers are misleading and in many cases false. Although
plastic products may break into small pieces, those pieces still
cause environmental concerns, the group said.
   ``Manufacturers of `degradable' plastics are appealing to
consumers' environmental concerns on a basic emotional level with
little regard for whether their claims are supported by scientific
evidence,'' said the Greenpeace report.
   Many of the product manufacturers, however, defend their claims
and said Friday they welcomed the FTC's investigation.
   ``What we're seeing now is a great deal of disinformation,''
said Timothy Draeger, executive director of the St. Louis-based
Degradable Plastics Council. ``The FTC normally looks into things
like this. We welcome their participation.''
   A survey last year of 1,000 adults by the management consulting
firm Michael Peters Group showed nearly nine in 10 people were
concerned about products' impact on the environment. Eight in 10
said they would pay extra for a product packaged with recyclable or
biodegradable material.
   The producers of plastic trash bags have turned to environmental
marketing on a grand scale.
   A spokesman for Mobil Chemical Corp., which makes the ``Hefty''
degradable trash bag, said its claims that the bags degrade in
sunlight have been ``fully substantiated'' by tests and that the
company never said the bags would be the answer to the country's
waste disposal problem.
   Mobil spokesman Allen Gray acknowledged in an interview that the
company began marketing the degradable bags because of competitive
pressures.
   ``We're in the business of selling bags. ... The consumer out
there has an extremely high positive association with degradable
products. Our competition has come out with degradable products and
we're responding,'' said Gray.
   Bob Chickering, president of American Enviro Products, also
vigorously defends his ``Bunnies'' diapers, which are marketed as
being biodegradable.
   ``I would like someone to show us that it doesn't work,'' said
Chickering, who acknowledged that his product is among those being
looked into by the FTC. He says he's sold 100 million ``Bunnies''
diapers since they went on the market eight months ago.
   The ``Bunnies'' diapers use a cornstarch additive, produced by
Archer Daniels Midland Co., to hasten the breakup of the plastic.

   As a military wife, Ms. Allee ``has consistently engaged in

   The statement said that most recently Ms. Allee worked
extensively on improving child care services for military personnel
in Charleston, S.C., and in Norfolk.
   ``The president applauds Toni Allee for her commitment to
bettering every community to which she belongs,'' the White House

   U.S. trade negotiators are claiming some
success in talks aimed at opening the Japanese market to the sale
of more U.S. lumber products, but two members of Congress contend
much more needs to be done.
   A U.S. trade official, who briefed reporters Friday on condition
of anonymity, said that two days of discussion this week produced
some willingness by the Japanese to lower tariffs on laminated wood
products and to allow more lumber to be used in construction.
   However, the official said both sides remained far apart that on
many of the American demands. Lumber is one of three areas _ along
with satellites and supercomputers _ where negotiators are trying
to remove Japanese trade barriers in an effort to reduce the United
States' $49 billion trade deficit with Japan.
   If barriers are not removed by a June 16 deadline, the Bush
administration has the power to retaliate by raising tariffs on
Japanese products.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the chairman of a Senate trade
subcommittee, said it was much too early to claim success.
   ``In order to succeed, we must keep the pressure on Japan,'' he
said in a statement. ``General positive statements don't open
markets, agreements do.''
   A congressman from another lumber-producing state, Rep. Ron
Wyden, D-Ore., said Friday in a letter to Bush that progress so far
had been minimal.
   ``We have put forward a broad agenda of reasonable changes in
the Japanese system of tariffs, standards and codes _ changes which
will benefit Japanese consumers as well as U.S. producers,'' Wyden
said. ``The Japanese response has been limited, short-sighted and
destined to increase trade tension between our two nations.''
   The discussions, along with negotiations aimed at removing
broad-ranging structural barriers to trade, were reviewed at a
recent summit meeting between President Bush and Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   Talks this week on wood products and satellites and discussions
next week on supercomputers are the first negotiations held since
the Bush-Kaifu summit.
   While some progress was made in the wood dispute, negotiators
reported ``zero progress'' on satellites and said no further
meetings would be held unless the Japanese side was willing to move
from its current position.
   The trade official said an eighth round of talks on wood would
be held in early April in Tokyo.
   ``We want a package to significantly open up the Japanese
markets,'' the U.S. official said. ``We are disappointed with the
rate of progress, but we are not despairing. We still have some
time left.''
   He said the Japanese had indicated a willingness to revise their
building codes to allow greater use of American lumber although
they still object to making as many changes as the U.S. seeks.
   The official said there also was some movement on a U.S. demand
that tariffs on two types of laminated wood products be lowered to
3.9 percent, down from a current 15 percent to 20 percent.
   The U.S. lumber industry currently exports $2.8 billion in
products annually to Japan, the bulk of that in raw logs. The
industry has estimated that Japanese barriers translate into $1
billion to $2 billion in lost sales to U.S. producers.

<HEAD>Company Proposes Plan to Send Satellite to Orbit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small Virginia aerospace company is
proposing a plan in which shuttle astronauts would attach a rocket
to a low-flying $150 million satellite and send it to a useful life
22,300 miles above Earth.
   An Intelsat satellite failed to achieve its proper orbit this
week after launch atop a Titan 3 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla.
On Friday, rocket builder Martin Marietta attributed the failure to
a wiring problem in the Titan.
   ``A bold and coordinated team effort involving NASA, Martin
Marietta, Hughes, and OSC can successfully complete this mission
for Intelsat,'' Robert R. Lovell of Orbital Sciences Corp., wrote
to NASA Administrator Richard Truly and others.
   Kerry Masson, a Martin Marietta spokeswoman in Denver, said that
during the launch, a signal failed to make it from an onboard
computer to the mechanism that was to separate the rocket and the
satellite.
   Without that separation, a motor attached to the satellite was
unable to propel the spacecraft to its high orbit. When engineers
finally separated satellite and spent shell, the booster rocket
remained with the launch vehicle and both are expected to fall back
to Earth soon.
   Intelsat, which owns the $150 million uninsured satellite, fired
small onboard thrusters and raised the satellite's orbit by nearly
60 miles Friday, putting the 5-ton satellite out of immediate reach
of the atmosphere.
   Orbital Sciences Corp. proposed that its new rocket device,
called a Transfer Orbit Stage, be carried to orbit on the shuttle
and be mated to the satellite.
   That, said OSC, would ``complete the mission from orbit rather
than returning the satellite to Earth for refurbishment and
relaunch.''
   The Transfer Orbit Stage is designed to boost spacecraft from
low Earth orbit to the 22,300 mile-high altitude at which
communications satellites operate. The device was qualified for
space flight only in January.

   Jury deliberations in Joseph
Hazelwood's trial may coincide with the first anniversary of the
Exxon Valdez oil spill, but the judge says that is no reason for
jurors to be sequestered.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone on Friday turned down a bid
by Hazelwood's lawyers to have jurors stay at a hotel with bailiffs
guarding them during their deliberations next week in the skipper's
criminal trial.
   Johnstone said that under Alaska law, requests for jury
sequestration must come before a jury is sworn in unless there is
``good cause'' to do so later.
   He said the defense request was not timely and he did not
consider approaching publicity about the anniversary as ``good
cause'' for not allowing jurors to go home each night.
   Defense Attorney Dick Madson argued that the marking of one year
since the nation's largest oil spill last March 24 will bring a
flood of publicity and possible demonstrations in the vicinity of
the Anchorage courthouse.
   Final arguments are scheduled for Tuesday, and Johnstone said he
hopes to instruct jurors in the law and submit the case to them the
same day. Legal discussions of jury instructions are scheduled for
Monday.
   The Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound last March
24 spilling nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska crude oil which
devastated fisheries and wildlife and blackened hundreds of miles
of rocky shore.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is the only member of the
ship's crew to face criminal charges. He is accused of a felony,
criminal mischief, and three misdemeanors _ reckless endangerment,
operating a vessel while intoxicated, and negligent discharge of
oil. If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to 7\ years
in prison and fined $61,000.
   In a court session on jury instructions Friday, the judge ruled
he would tell the panel they may not consider Hazelwood's alleged
efforts to move his ship off Bligh Reef reef as evidence of
recklessness.
   He said testimony has established that it was impossible for the
ship to move anywhere after it grounded and thus there was no risk
under the law.
   But the judge said he would allow jurors to consider Hazelwood's
efforts in turning on the engines and moving the ship's rudder
after grounding as possible evidence of his impairment by alcohol.
   To find Hazelwood guilty of operating a vessel while
intoxicated, jurors must determine that he had a blood alcohol
level of .10 or greater when his ship hit Bligh Reef shortly after
midnight.
   Prosecutors have attempted through expert witnesses to calculate
backwards and prove this, but no actual blood test was taken on
Hazelwood until 10{ hours after the grounding.
   Defense expert witnesses said such calculations are nonsense.
   After six weeks of testimony, Hazelwood chose to remain silent
rather than take the witness stand and discuss his role in the
Exxon Valdez disaster.
   His attorneys said they believed the prosecution had not proven
its case and it was unnecessary to put the defendant on the stand.

   With killer bees approaching U.S.
borders, scientists are looking for a salve for the honeybee
industry to take the economic sting out of the invasion.
   Reports of swarming Africanized bees attacking small children
and large animals have beekeepers worried _ not so much about
sometimes deadly bites as about the way they earn their living.
   ``Beekeepers will go out of business ... rather than go through
all of this ordeal,'' said Donald O'Neill, president of the
Louisiana Beekeepers Association. ``People will not want to let
them have locations to place their bees because people are afraid
of the Africanized bee.''
   Much of the research under way at the U.S. Agriculture
Department's Honey-Bee Breeding, Genetics and Physiology Laboratory
at Louisiana State University is focused on protecting the gene
pool of the domesticated European honeybee and teaching the public
how to avoid the aggressive Africanized honeybee.
   Bees help pollinate more than 100 crop plants in the United
States, including almonds, apples, watercress and white clover.
   ``Every third mouthful of food or drink you take is there
because of honeybees,'' said Richard Hellmich, a research
entomologist at the Honey-Bee lab.
   At the small lab in a pasture dotted with beehives, researchers
examine Africanized bees, trying to expose the secrets of genetics,
identification and behavior.
   The Africanized bee _ scientists dislike the sensational
``killer bee'' moniker _ could wing into Brownsville, Texas, this
spring. The bees have migrated 200 to 300 miles annually.
   The $100 million-plus U.S. commercial bee business is beginning
to feel the Africanized sting now.
   ``These bees aren't as bad as people make them out to be,'' said
Bob Danka, a research entomologist at the Honey-Bee lab. ``They are
a problem. They're more defensive and not as productive.''
   The difference between the European honeybee, a companion of
humans for the last 8,000 years, and the Africanized honeybee is
like the difference between a domestic and a wild bee.
   They look the same. It takes minute measurements and genetic
tests to distinguish them.
   ``The biggest problem in the United States will be liability,''
Danka said. ``People will get stung to death by these bees.''
   But sensitive people also get stung to death by the gentler
European bees, hornets and yellow jackets. Fewer people will die
from Africanized bee stings than from lightning strikes, he said.
   ``A few to a few dozen die every year from insect stings. They
died because one-half of 1 percent are allergic to bee stings. It's
the same with Africanized bees ... which also will kill you by
sheer numbers,'' Danka said.
   The most likely victims are small children and old people who
cannot outrun the insects, he said.
   Twenty-six Africanized queen bees, exported to Brazil for a
breeding experiment, were inadvertently released to breed with
South American bees in 1957. Their range extends from northern
Argentina to northern Mexico.
   The scientists fear public overreaction to the arrival of
Africanized bees could result in paralyzing quarantines. Even now,
live Africanized bees are not allowed in the United States for
study, so the researchers took their work out of the country to
places like Venezuela, where the bees have a stronghold.
   ``We've seen these killer bee movies. It's pure science fiction.
It sells newspapers. It sells magazines,'' Hellmich said. ``But at
the same time, we can't ignore Africanized bees.''

   Toyota is recalling 1984 Corollas and Camrys
manufactured in 1983 and 1984 to replace cruise control computers,
but a consumer group says an investigation of later models is
needed.
   The National Highway Safety Administration said Friday it would
study the Washington-based Center for Auto Safety's request for an
investigation of Camrys and Corollas made between 1985 and 1988.
   In a letter to the agency's Office of Defects Investigation, the
center's Samuel H. Cole said there had been more than 30 reports of
accidents after the cars suddenly accelerated and more than 200
reports of faulty cruise controls.
   Toyota told the agency last month it was recalling 1983-84
Camrys and 1984 Corollas for cruise control computer replacement, a
move the center called inadequate.
   ``Toyota falls far short of recalling all affected Camrys and
Corollas,'' Cole said.
   Toyota spokeswoman Debra Sanchez Fair said she knew of no
complaints about the 1985-88 models and declined to comment on
whether an expanded investigation was justified.
   The ``engine revving'' problem on the 1983 and 1984 models
resulted from long-term wear, she said. The recall, covering about
120,000 cars, was ordered after two complaints were received in
Canada.
   Meanwhile, the NHTSA said it was upgrading three investigations
of possible automobile defects from preliminary evaluations, which
involve mostly paperwork, to engineering analyses in which
engineers study the allegedly defective parts.
   Each probe could end with a recall order.
   The first involves Chevrolet Camaros manufactured between 1984
and 1988. An estimated 819,699 are on the road.
   There have been 169 complaints of axle shaft problems that can
cause loss of steering control, agency spokesman Tim Hurd said.
Consumers have blamed the problem for 132 accidents and 59 injuries.
   The second engineering analysis involves electrical systems of
Plymouth Voyagers and Dodge Caravans manufactured between 1984 and
1989, of which 1.7 million are on the road. There have been 86
reports of fires under the dashboards.
   The third covers 423,171 Ford Cougars and Thunderbirds from the
1988 and 1989 model years. There have been 105 complaints of
sticking throttles, which cause the cars to speed up on their own.
The problem is blamed for 10 accidents and seven injuries.
   The agency also announced preliminary evaluations of:
   _Possible under-dashboard fires and parking brake failures in
1990 Chevrolet Corvettes. There have been no reports of either
problem but the company has ordered dealers to replace electrical
wiring and check parking brakes on the cars, which Hurd said could
indicate a potential for fires or brake failures.
   ``We're checking to see if there are any safety implications,''
Hurd said.
   _Spare tire cable breakage in General Motors S-10 and S-15
trucks, Astros and Safaris from 1982 through 1989. There have been
five complaints. The probe covers 2.04 million vehicles.
   _Safety belt problems in 33,000 Corvettes from 1986 and 1987.
There have been seven complaints.

   Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk! It's time for the
Sixth Annual Shemp Festival.
   ``Grand Moron'' Leo Honeycutt of WBRZ-TV in Baton Rouge was to
preside over events today and Sunday to honor former Three Stooges
member Shemp Howard.
   Among the festivities is the Hoi Polloi Ball, a monster pie
fight with 1,000 custard pies, and a Pie Queen contest.
   The festival is the brainchild of assistant Fire Chief Kirk
Landry, mechanic James B. LeBlanc and state Deputy Fire Marshal
Aaron Hebert.
   Proceeds go to the Fire Department in Donaldsonville, about 55
miles west of New Orleans.
   The pie queen's crown, made from an unfilled pie shell, is not
necessarily given to the most gorgeous entrant.
   ``It's got nothing to do with looks. Of course, that doesn't
hurt,'' Landry said Friday. ``It's 10 percent attire, 30 percent
participation and the other 60 percent is judged on degeneration.''

   Grumman Corp. has been ordered to pay $2.5
million in fines and penalties after pleading guilty to illegally
obtaining secret Air Force budget documents.
   Grumman's plea Friday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va.,
to two counts of conveyance of government property without
authority made it the fourth defense contractor since November to
plea guilty to illegal trafficking of Pentagon documents.
   The company admitted it obtained the two secret Air Force
program objective memoranda for 1983 and 1984 through former
employee Harry Kotellos.
   Kotellos, 53, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who joined
Grumman in 1980, pleaded guilty last Monday to conspiracy. He faces
a possible five-year prison term and a fine of up to $250,000.
   In a statement of facts filed by prosecutors, Grumman admitted
that between 1978 and 1985 it illegally acquired a wide range of
Defense Department budget documents, including five-year spending
plans for Pentagon programs.
   U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton, who accepted the guilty
plea, ordered the company to pay $2.5 million in fines and civil
penalties.

<HEAD>Fort Bragg NCO Said Investigated For Panama Incident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army is investigating allegations that a
prisoner was shot to death during the U.S. invasion of Panama,
according to a military journal.
   Fifty-nine other incidents described as happening in ``a combat
situation'' also are being investigated, including suicides and an
accidental killing, Army Times said Friday.
   Army Times, an independent weekly, provided advance copies of an
article on the Panama invasions to appear in Monday's edition.
   Col. William Mulvey, chief of public affairs for the Army, said,
``They've got it wrong.'' But he declined to detail what was wrong
with the article.
   Eight of the incidents involved deaths, including one in which a
senior non-commissioned officer allegedly shot a prisoner and beat
another after a skirmish at a roadblock, the journal reported.
   The NCO, said to have been a member of the 82nd Airborne
Division from Fort Bragg, N.C., was part of a roadblock that
stopped a car following the U.S. invasion on Dec. 20.
   Someone inside the car threw a hand grenade at the soldiers, who
then fired into the car, killing some occupants, according to Army
Times' account.
   The remaining occupants surrendered, got out and were taken
prisoner.
   The NCO allegedly shot one of the prisoners, killing him, and
severely beat another, according to the weekly.
   Other incidents involved the accidental killing of one U.S.
soldier by another and two suicides, the publication said.
   A total of 21 formal investigations by the Criminal
Investigation Command have been opened, Army Times said.

<HEAD>Bush Calls for Peace in Northern Ireland</HEAD>

   President Bush issued an appeal for peace in
Northern Ireland on the eve of St. Patrick's Day.
   ``There is one thing all of us here, all Americans, are united
in, and that is our desire for peace and tranquility in Northern
Ireland,'' Bush said Friday as he received a bowl of shamrocks from
visiting Irish Deputy Prime Minister Brian Lenihan at a Rose Garden
ceremony.
   ``We can't forget the suffering and the tragedy that plagues St.
Patrick's Island and there's no place for violence in creating a
new future for Northern Ireland.''
   Lenihan presented the shamrocks to Bush, telling him ``the
shamrock itself, three leaves on one stem, is a symbol of unity _
the essential unity between the American and the Irish peoples that
has been celebrated in this manner since the time of the first
president of the United States, George Washington.''
   Bush, wearing a bright green tie and a gray suit, reached into
the bowl and scooped out a handful of shamrocks. He stuffed them
into in his breast pocket like a handkerchief.
   First lady Barbara Bush, wearing a green dress, also attended
the brief ceremony.

   A legislator asked the governor to
declare a state of emergency to investigate a religious group that
directed hundreds of members in a surprise drill to prepare for
nuclear disaster.
   Rep. Bob Raney of Livingston made his request to Gov. Stan
Stephens after members of the Church Universal and Triumphant
entered the shelters near Yellowstone National Park in southwestern
Montana.
   Raney said Friday that he called for the investigation because
``nobody who is not in this valley at this time can imagine what's
going on. No longer can anybody here gather what reality really is.
It is bizarre.''
   Steve Yeakel, chief of staff to Stephens, said the county
commission should investigate the group, not state government.
   The drill was the latest in a rush of activity by Church
Universal members to prepare underground fallout shelters for
possible occupation. One shelter, several miles north of
Yellowstone, holds 756 people.
   Church spiritual leader Elizabeth Clare Prophet has warned
members that March and April are dangerous times, and suggested
they come to Montana to make preparations for a possible nuclear
war or accident.
   ``Our goal was to see if we could get everybody in the shelters
at midnight (Thursday),'' said church spokesman Murray Steinman.
   Steinman refused to say how many people participated, but said
the drill ``included a large percentage of the people who will be
slated to inhabit the shelters in the event of a nuclear war.'' He
said church members did not plan to remain in the shelters. Members
left the shelters Friday morning.
   The church has been scrutinized by its neighbors and media since
buying the 12,500-acre Royal Teton Ranch bordering Yellowstone in
1981 from the late publisher Malcolm Forbes.
   It later expanded its holdings in Park County to 30,000 acres,
built two food-processing plants, opened a printing plant in
Livingston and sponsored two housing developments for church
members.
   But the church has been selling off portions of its Montana
properties in recent months while building and stocking the fallout
shelters.
   In 1987, Mrs. Prophet said she received a divine message that
the nation should develop civil defense and missile-defense systems
in anticipation of a nuclear confrontation. War didn't occur by the
predicted date of Oct. 2, 1989, but followers say her messages are
warnings rather than predictions.

<HEAD>Bogota Angered By U.S. Search Of Two Colombian Ships</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States sailed in stormy
diplomatic seas after its search of two Colombian ships suspected
of carrying cocaine brought a protest from the government of
President Virgilio Barco.
   The government announcement came Friday, a week after the
freighters Taru and Ciudad de Zipaquira were stopped separately
about 125 miles off its Caribbean coast and searched by the U.S.
Coast Guard, according to Colombia.
   No drugs were found aboard the ships, the Colombian government
said.
   The searches occurred March 9, the same day the Pentagon
announced plans to expand anti-drug efforts on the high seas. The
U.S. plans did not include a proposal to operate a flotilla off
Colombia.
   The protest came two months after plans to station U.S. warships
off the coast to interdict drug traffickers drew criticism from
Colombian officials. Last month, Barco warned Washington it would
not let its ships be stopped and searched without prior Colombian
approval.
   There was no immediate comment from officials in Washington.
   The Foreign Ministry said Friday it delivered a protest note to
the U.S. Embassy late Thursday over the searching of the first
vessel, Taru. Hours later, the government said the Ciudad de
Zipaquira had the same experience.
   The Taru, carrying cement from Barranquilla, Colombia, to the
Colombian island of San Andres, ``was in an exclusive economic
zone, where according to international agreement there is freedom
of navegation and trade,'' Assistant Foreign Minister Clemencia
Forero told the radio network RCN.
   Barco told reporters at Bogota's airport upon returning from
Brazil Friday that he spoke there with Vice President Dan Quayle
about the search of the Taru. He gave no details.
   Barco and Quayle attended the inauguration Thursday of President
Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil.
   Colombia and the United States have worked closely in the drug
war since Colombia began a crackdown on drug traffickers in August,
including extradition of trafficking suspects to the United States.
   The Taru and Ciudad de Zipaquira were stopped well outside the
internationally recognized territorial limit of 12 miles, but
Colombia claims a 200-mile limit for fishing and mineral and oil
rights.
   Also, the ships were stopped within a corridor between
Colombia's mainland and a group of Colombian islands about 400
miles out into the Caribbean.
   While Colombia's protest note spoke of ``an exclusive economic
zone,'' it was not known if that referred to the 200-mile limit or
to the trade corridor.
   The captain of the Taru said in a broadcast interview that his
craft was stopped by a Coast Guard cutter and the crew was held in
the ship's galley for six hours while the Americans searched the
ship. He said the Americans asked permission to board and he
granted it.
   Defense Minister Gen. Oscar Botero told reporters Friday that
the Ciudad de Zipaquira was searched for hours by a Coast Guard
cutter crew after being stopped, like the Taru, about 125 miles off
Colombia.
   Colombia hosted an anti-drug summit in Cartagena Feb. 15 that
included Bush, Barco and the leaders of Bolivia and Peru. Bush
promised economic aid if their countries continue fighting
traffickers.
   Since Colombia's drug crackdown began, terrorism by drug
traffickers has killed 209 people, including all 106 people aboard
a bombed Colombian airliner, the government says.
   The Barco government in January registered no official protest
with Washington over U.S. plans to station warships off the
Colombian coast to snare traffickers, but the plans drew fire from
Colombian opposition lawmakers and even Barco's foreign minister,
Julio Londono Paredes.
   Coming after the U.S. invasion of Panama in December, Colombian
leaders said the proposal amounted to a blockade. President Bush
withdrew the plan, pending further talks with Colombian officials.

   A high school classmate of Terry Anderson's
pleaded that he be freed in time for their 25th reunion this summer
as friends and relatives broke a 24-hour fast on the fifth
anniversary of his captivity.
   The service Friday night concluded ceremonies marking The
Associated Press journalist's captivity since March 16, 1985, the
day he was kidnapped on a street in Beirut. Anderson, the AP's
chief Middle East correspondent, is the longest-held of the
American hostages in Lebanon.
   Although he left Batavia 25 years ago to join the Marines and
seldom returned, former hostages said the town was much in his mind
as Anderson entertained them with travelogues during the long hours
of imprisonment, Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, said in a letter
read at the ceremony.
   ``Time after time he has brought them back to Batavia, shackled,
blindfolded, seeing only what his memory held,'' Say wrote in the
letter, read aloud by Anderson's sister-in-law, Penny Anderson.
``He walked the streets, returned to school, saw family and friends
and for a few moments was at peace.''
   Mrs. Anderson and a cousin, Carl Anderson of Buffalo, were among
those who broke their fast with bread wrapped in yellow yarn. Also
present was Anne Zickl, who leads local efforts on Anderson's
behalf even though she has never met him.
   Stephen Hawley, a Genesee County legislator who graduated with
Anderson from Batavia High School in 1965, said the class hopes to
see Anderson at its reunion in July.
   ``Terry is dying a slow death in Lebanon,'' Hawley said. ``He
has spent 20 percent of his life since graduation in chains. The
time has come for all governments who have any influence over the
captors to heed our pleas and our prayers. Release Terry Anderson.
Release all the hostages now.''
   Other ceremonies were held Friday in Washington, D.C., where the
humanitarian group No Greater Love held a service in Lafayette Park
across from the White House and in Tokyo, where Anderson worked for
the AP from 1977 to 1981.
   In Lorain, Ohio, where Anderson was born, veterans fired a rifle
salute, and three Anderson cousins tied a large yellow ribbon
around the city's flagpole Friday.
   In Garfield, N.J., 200 schoolchildren attended a Mass for
Anderson.
   In Peggy Say's hometown, Cadiz, Ky., hundreds of yellow ribbons
were tied to trees and doors along Main Street to mark the
anniversary.
   And in New York City, friends and colleagues of Anderson
attended a Mass for him at St. Patrick's Cathedral.

   Death penalty advocates were unable to override Cuomo's seven
previous vetoes or the six issued by former Gov. Hugh Carey.
   And in both the Republican-controlled state Senate and the
Democrat-controlled Assembly, this year's action on the legislation
showed sponsors one vote short in each house of being able to
override Cuomo's veto.
   New York's electric chair hasn't been used since 1963.
   Cuomo, a Democrat who has said he expects to seek re-election
this year, called again Friday for the Legislature to approve his
alternative to the death penalty for murderers _ life in prison
without parole. Thus far, the Legislature has refused.

   Ministers are developing a sanctuary
network for teen-agers who fear their parents will force them to
live in the underground fallout shelters of a religious group
preparing for nuclear Armageddon.
   ``I think it is a dangerous situation for youngsters,'' the Rev.
Dick Schlosser of St. Mary's Catholic Church in Livingston, Mont.,
said of talk about entering underground shelters established by the
Church Universal and Triumphant.
   ``Adults, they're entitled to their own paranoia. But I don't
feel we have the right to do that to children.''
   So far, at least four children of members of the Church
Universal and Triumphant have sought refuge from their parents,
those involved with the sanctuary network said.
   A state legislator, meanwhile, asked Gov. Stan Stephens to
declare a state of emergency after hundreds of Church Universal
members entered shelters in a surprise drill Thursday night. Church
members left the shelters Friday morning.
   Rep. Bob Raney of Livingston said he wants the governor ``to put
together a task force of all state agencies ... and ask for
assistance from the federal government to step in here and take a
look at this whole activity.''
   A spokesman for Stephens said county commissioners, not state
government, should take action regarding the group.
   Church Universal leaders have denied their flock is preparing to
move underground, and said there is no cause for alarm. They said
the shelters are for use only in the event of nuclear war or
accident.
   The sanctuary is a response to the suddenly frenzied efforts of
the religious movement to build and stock fallout shelters for
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of its members following prophecies of
disaster from spiritual leader and church founder Elizabeth Clare
Prophet.
   Church Universal spokesmen said the sanctuary movement is
illegal, and the county prosecutor said the children will be
returned to their parents unless they have been abused.
   Ministers from mainline churches acknowledge potential legal
problems, but say the church always has been a place for sanctuary.
   The biggest shelter, which is for the church staff, is a huge
756-person complex a few miles north of the park border. Other
shelters are scattered throughout the Paradise Valley region that
stretches north from the church compound.
   Mrs. Prophet, who claims she receives and passes on to church
members messages from a group of souls known as the Ascended
Masters, has warned church members that March and April would be
dangerous times.
   She told members to come to Montana for a prayer vigil and to
prepare for a possible nuclear war or accident.
   Livingston area businesspeople said there has been a flurry of
activity since then _ church members buying survival gear, food,
ammunition and medicine, closing bank accounts and renting moving
trailers and trucks.
   Church spokesman Murray Steinman said: ``I didn't close my bank
account. I'm sitting in my office and doing business.''
   But the frenzy has caused concern in the small southwestern
Montana community, home of the sanctuary movement. Local officials
estimate 2,000 church members live in the area, or 15 percent of
the county population.
   The Rev. Bill Kliber of Grace United Methodist Church said he
and several other clergymen were asked last week to act as
intermediaries between adolescents seeking refuge and foster
families who might accept them. Another local pastor said he was
offering his church as a temporary sanctuary.
   Steinman said the clergymen's involvement ``smacks of a
deliberate attempt to intervene in family life, where I don't think
these people have any business.''
   Park County Attorney Nels Swandal said the teen-agers are
runaway children and will be returned to their parents unless
evidence of child abuse is found.
   Kliber and others said they have an eerie feeling that something
is wrong.
   ``For the first time, I'm expecting something bizarre to
happen,'' said Kliber, who added that he maintains close
relationships with some Church Universal members and bears them no
ill will. ``I have nothing to go on but a feeling in the community.
   ``Members of the CUT group have come and said goodbye to people
at banks, to brokers and to accountants. I don't like the idea that
they're going around and saying farewell; that frightens me.''

   The real estate market got hot with the
announcement that an $8 billion atom smasher would be built in this
town where ``Bonnie and Clyde'' was filmed, but some greeted news
of the final plans with boos.
   ``We don't want our nice little town to disappear in a crowd of

clerk for Ellis County, where the U.S. Department of Energy decided
to put the giant superconducting super collider project.
   The DOE announced Thursday where the ``footprint'' of the giant

they will have to sell their homesteads, farms and ranches to the
government.
   Real estate companies in Waxahachie already were reporting an
increase in business as scientists start looking for homes near the
project.
   ``I really am afraid of what it's going to be like after the
super collider gets here,'' Mrs. Shivers said. ``I don't know if
I'll want to live here. And that's talking about a family that's
lived her for five generations.''
   Proponents say the super collider will create 2,500 permanent
jobs, 4,500 temporary construction jobs, and inject $370 million
per year into the economy when completed.
   Texas agreed to spend up to $1 billion to lure the project.
Congress just approved $225 million in the current fiscal year for
startup costs, and the Bush administration is asking for $318
million for the coming year.
   At the International Industrial Symposium on the Super Collider
Friday in Florida, a congressman said scientists and educators
would have to join the funding battle.
   ``We can't build it alone,'' said Rep. Robert A. Roe, D-N.J. He
chairs the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, which
will recommend $7.5 billion be spent on the project.
   Officials say the project will mean better schools and a
generally higher standard of living for area residents.
   Talk of financial growth doesn't wash with 76-year-old Weldon
Aday. He and his wife Jewell, 73, inherited their homestead seven
miles from Waxahachie.
   ``My grandfather settled here before the turn of the century and
my father passed it on to me. And I hope to pass it on to my son,''
Aday said. But he worries about traffic jams on the two-lane roads.
   Waxahachie, a town of small buildings and 18,000 residents that
is the seat of Ellis County, soon will be encircled by the 54-mile
collider.
   The city's economy is based largely on the region's cotton and
sorghum crops, but Hollywood has discovered Waxahachie, too. In
addition to ``Bonnie and Clyde,'' ``Tender Mercies,'' ``Places in
the Heart,'' ``True Stories,'' and ``A Trip to Bountiful'' have
been filmed in or near the town.
   As word of the super collider's final plans circulated Friday,
landowners arrived by the dozens at state land offices to find out
their fate. State officials plan to meet next week with the 670
people who own land covered by the plan.
   The gently rolling farm and ranch land generally sells for $500
to $800 per acre, said county clerk Faye Washington. But Cathy
Lynn, who will lose her homestead, said her neighbor sold out two
years ago for $7,000 an acre.
   When the collider site was announced, many people believed
riches were on the way. ``That's fizzled,'' she said, as they
realized the limits of ``fair market value.''
   The gigantic atom smasher will be the world's premier
high-energy physics laboratory. In the 54-mile underground ring,
streams of protons will be hurled by powerful electromagnets at
almost the speed of light until they collide and break into smaller
particles.
   The project is designed to expand knowledge of subatomic
particles, the building blocks of the universe.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Novosti report, charge that satellite
could fall in Soviet Union. Picks up 14th pvs, `The Defense...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newest U.S. spy satellite is disintegrating in
space and fragments are expected to plunge into the atmosphere
within a month, the Novosti news agency said today.
   In Washington, the Defense Department said Friday only that
``hardware elements'' carried into orbit by the Atlantis space
shuttle would fall from the sky soon, but a later U.S. newspaper
report said the satellite itself would plunge into the atmosphere.
   Novosti said Soviet space tracking systems detected four
orbiting fragments, ``which presumably separated from the American
spy satellite which was recently put into orbit by the Atlantis
reusable spaceship.''
   The satellite was launched Feb. 28 aboard the space shuttle
Atlantis from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on a secret military mission
that sources said included the launch of a sophisticated spy
satellite.
   Novosti said scientists who analyzed the fragments' orbits
believe the objects will fall to Earth, possibly over northern
regions of the Soviet Union, between Monday and April 10.
   The Washington Post today quoted an unidentified U.S.
intelligence official as characterizing the malfunction as a
``serious setback.''
   The heat of re-entry will destroy major components and prevent
anyone from recovering super-secret equipment, the newspaper quoted
intelligence officials as saying.
   A earlier Defense Department statement said only that the
mission ``achieved its goal in association with a classified DOD
program.'' The Pentagon statement did not mention a satellite.
   ``Hardware elements are expected to re-enter the Earth's
atmosphere,'' the statement said. ``We believe there is no risk to
life or property.''
   Pete Williams, the Defense Department spokesman, would not say
where or when the hardware elements would plunge back toward the
Earth and what portions might be expected to survive intact.
   Novosti said, ``one can only assume that the spy satellite has
been blown up by its owners for some unknown reasons'' and the
protracted silence by U.S. space officials ``simply confirms the
above suggestion.''
   The news agency criticized the U.S. space agency for failing to
notify the international community about the existence of the
satellite and the dangers of its falling to Earth.
   Novosti criticized NASA for not issuing information on the
``fragments or on the satellite itself, although by the existing
international rules, upon the orbiting of any Earth satelites, the
country which has launched it must notify other countries through
the U.N. of the satelllites basic characteristcs and the parameters
of its orbit,'' Novosti said.
   U.S. sources said the satellite was a $500 million craft capable
of taking high resolution photos and eavesdropping on electronic
communications over much of the world.
   The Defense Department, however, declined to confirm or deny
these reports. The astronauts on the mission maintained public
air-to-ground silence during the flight, in contrast with civilian
shuttle crews whose every remark is played over a public radio
circuit.
   Space debris re-enters the earth's atmosphere from time to time,
with most of it burning up from the heat of re-entry.
   Since 70 percent of the earth's surface is ocean, what does make
it to the ground has a good chance of falling harmlessly into the
ocean.
   Two examples are the Solar Maximum scientific observatory, which
fell into the Indian Ocean last Dec. 2, and the Cosmos 1402 Soviet
satellite, which came down in two parts _ a 110-pound nuclear
reactor into the South Atlantic in February 1983 and the four-ton
main body of the spacecraft into the Indian Ocean the previous
month.
   Pieces of the U.S. Skylab satellite came down in the wilderness
of western Australia in 1981, and debris and radioactivity from an
earlier Soviet Cosmos satellite fell in the Canadian wilderness in
1978.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
has asked the Security Council to quadruple a U.N. force to be sent
to Nicaragua to disarm Contra rebels and protect those awaiting
resettlement.
   The proposal Friday would increase the number of troops from 260
to about 1,060 and would expand the mission's purpose, which
currently involves only verifying the cutoff of Contra aid and
patrolling borders to prevent guerrilla attacks.
   Perez de Cuellar said Nicaragua's outgoing Sandinista government
and the incoming administration of President-elect Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro have stressed the importance of voluntary
demobilization of the Contras in the transfer of power in Nicaragua.
   ``If, as I fervently hope, it proves possible for all the
parties concerned to reach early agreement on a plan based on the
modalities described in this report, the United Nations will have
to move quickly to deploy the additional personnel and material
resources,'' he said.
   Contra leaders, however, have said they will not lay down their
arms until the Sandinistas relinquish power over the military.
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has said the Contras must lay
down their arms before his party turns over the military to Mrs.
Chamorro, who takes office April 25.
   A U.S. government source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Friday that hundreds of armed Contras in Honduras have defied
calls for their demobilization and have reinfiltrated Nicaragua,
swelling the ranks from 3,500 to 5,000. The rebels are receiving
U.S. non-lethal aid.
   Thomas Pickering, U.S. permanent representative to the United
Nations, said all nations speaking during the Security Council
session agreed in principle to expand the mandate of the U.N.
Observer Group in Central America.
   The 15-member council plans to vote next week on the
secretary-general's proposal to expand the U.N. mission.
   Under Perez de Cuellar's proposal, the observer force would
collect weapons, ammunition, military equipment and uniforms from
the rebels.
   Contras who are in Honduras at the time of demobilization would
hand over their weapons at camps there and await repatriation or
resettlement elsewhere under international supervision.
   For rebels still in Nicaragua, the observer force would
establish temporary assembly points there and in border areas of
Costa Rica, according to the U.N. chief's proposal. The Contras
would be told to gather at the nearest assembly point, where the
peacekeepers plan to take control of weapons and military supplies.
   The U.N. chief stressed the demobilization process must be
voluntarily accepted by the Contras and said it should be possible
to complete the process in a period of four to six weeks.

<HEAD>Bank With Links to Marcos Admits Illegal Transfer of Philippine
Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the same day Imelda Marcos appeared at a
final court hearing before her racketeering trial, a Los Angeles
bank with links to her late husband admitted it illegally
transferred funds from the Philippines.
   The California Overseas Bank, which prosecutors said had been
partially owned by ousted Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos,
pleaded guilty Friday to wire fraud.
   The bank was to have gone to trial with Mrs. Marcos next week on
charges of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy.
   Through its attorney, Don Smaltz, the bank admitted that certain
officers had opened fictitious accounts to enable money to be
transferred to the United States from the Philippines.
   Prosecutors alleged that the bank was once partly owned by
Marcos. Its former president, Rodolfo T. Arambulo, pleaded guilty
to a conspiracy charge on Feb. 28 and is a potential witness
against Mrs. Marcos.
   Neither of the Marcoses were named during the plea. The only
thing Smaltz said about why the money was transferred to the bank
was that it was used by ``certain people.''
   The bank faces a $500,000 fine when sentenced April 23.
   The bank's plea leaves Mrs. Marcos and Saudi financier Adnan
Khashoggi as the only defendants in the trial. Jury selection
starts Tuesday in Manhattan's federal court.
   Both Mrs. Marcos and Khashoggi attended Friday's pretrial
hearing before U.S. District Judge John Keenan.
   The case is about the alleged transfer by Mrs. Marcos and her
late husband, Ferdinand, of more than $160 million from the
Philippines treasury to buy Manhattan real estate. The indictment
also alleges that the Marcoses defrauded $165 million from banking
institutions to finance the properties.
   Khashoggi is accused of helping the Marcoses hide their
ownership of the real estate through false documents.
   Ferdinand Marcos, the ousted Philippine leader, died Sept. 28 in
exile in Hawaii.
   In keeping with the traditional one-year mourning period in the
Philippines, Mrs. Marcos was dressed all in black.
   An attorney for Mrs. Marcos expressed concern about finding a
jury that will not have preconceived opinions about the former
Philippine first lady.
   ``Mrs. Marcos and her late husband have received much
unfavorable press,'' attorney Gerald Spence said. ``She has been
tried and convicted in the press.''
   It also was disclosed that Mrs. Marcos' lawyers want to call 91
people in the Philippines as defense witnesses but that the present
Filipino government won't let them leave the country.
   Keenan said he would go over the list of witnesses with Spence
and decide who should be allowed to testify. The judge said he then
would ask prosecutors to contact the State Department to see if a
compromise, like the taking of depositions, could be worked out
with the Filipino government.
   Mrs. Marcos is charged with racketeering, racketeering
conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice. If convicted of
all the counts, she faces a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison
and a $1 million fine.
   Khashoggi, who will be tried on mail fraud and obstruction of
justices charges, faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and
a $500,000 fine.

<HEAD>Study: Only 28 Doctors Available for New York's 1.7 Million Poor</HEAD>

   Only 28 doctors provide primary health services
for the 1.7 million people who live in the city's poorest
neighborhoods, a study reported.
   The report released Friday by the Community Service Society of
New York said said that the patient-to-doctor ratio represents a
shortage of about 500 doctors, based on the national average of
basic care by Americans.
   The additional 500 doctors would be needed in order for each
resident in the nine communities to make 3.6 primary care visits a
year _ the national average.
   The study found that there are in fact 701 physicians in the
surveyed neighborhoods but discovered that only 28 of them are
available to the majority of residents and able to offer their
patients the minimum elements of primary care.
   Nancy F. McKenzie, director of the CSS Health Unit, told a City
Council hearing Friday that more doctors is not the answer.
   ``In fact, there is an oversupply,'' McKenzie said. ``We are
speaking most urgently about realigning the system of health care
delivery.''
   In analyzing the findings, the report said ``the picture painted
here is frightening. The poor health status of people in low-income
communities is exacerbated by the significant shortage of primary
care providers in these areas.''
   The study also found:
   _Almost none of the 900 people who graduate annually from New
York medical schools practice in low-income communities.
   _Only a few minority students _ those most likely to practice in
high-need areas _ are accepted at state schools.
   _Those who do tend to the poor find the costs almost
prohibitive. Medicaid rates are only $11 a visit and many patients
have no medical insurance.
   The report, ``Building Primary Health Care in New York City's
Low-Income Communities,'' called for increasing Medicaid payments
and starting a state authority to finance primary care in poor
areas.

   The United States and Cuba are asking for special
status to bar ships from discharging waste in the Gulf of Mexico, a
spokesman for the International Maritime Organization said.
   Such status by agreement of the 159-nation U.N. body has been
applied to the Mediterranean, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Red Sea and
the Persian and Oman gulfs. No U.S. waters have been designated yet
as protected.
   The U.S. delegation to the maritime organization presented a
technical document Friday in support of the proposal, said the
spokesman for the organization, speaking on condition he not be
identified by name.
   According to the report, Texas alone says that some parts of its
coastline have recorded more than two tons of debris per mile
attributed to ships discharging waste.
   Cuba set up an exhibit illustrating the extensive damage already
done to the island's coastline by ship garbage and other waste.
   Venezuela, another of the 159 nations that are members of
maritime organization, asked the special status be extended to
include the entire Caribbean.
   A formal proposal on the special status is to be presented at
the next full meeting of the organization in November, the
spokesman said.
   The fall meeting also will consider a U.S.-sponsored convention
calling for a global system for responding to maritime oil
emergencies, he said.

   Cuban President Fidel Castro says his
three-decade-old Communist revolution doesn't need to be tested
with a popular vote and expressed repugnance with the U.S.
electoral system.
   Despite democratic reforms in Eastern Europe and Latin America,
the hard-line Communist leader told a two-hour news conference
Friday that he plans no changes.
   ``You don't play with the revolution,'' Castro told reporters
when asked if he would win a direct election with other candidates.
``It would be foolishness to have a test only to prove wrong those
who say Cuba holds fradulent elections.''
   ``Our system isn't direct, it's indirect, but in my judgment
very democratic,'' said Castro, who has ruled Cuba since a 1959
revolution.
   He said he felt ``repugnance'' for the electoral system in the
United States, which he called ``a parody.''
   His comments appeared to be his answer to Vice President Dan
Quayle, who on Thursday asked ``anyone who is in contact with
Castro to ask him when he's going to have elections.''
   Quayle, Castro and other regional leaders on Thursday attended
the inauguration of Fernando Collor de Mello, Brazil's first
popularly elected president in 29 years.
   Congresses of the ruling Communist Party choose Cuba's
leadership. On Thursday, Cuba's official Prensa Latina announced
that the first party congress in four years would be held in the
first half of 1991.
   Castro said he was secure in his leadership.
   ``How would it be possible to sustain the revolution faced for
30 years with a blockade from the United States if it didn't have
support?'' he said.
   When asked about recent critical articles on him in the Soviet
Union and his decision to censor circulation of Soviet magazines in
Cuba, Castro responded:
   ``We made the error of deifying everything that was coming from
there, and now the poison arrives. ... The revolutionary can't be
an idiot nor a fool and should have means of defense.''
   He said Latin America must move closer ``or we will be forever
colonies.''
   Castro also dismissed ``as an exaggeration'' news reports that
Brazilian authorities stopped his bodyguards from bringing in a
huge cache of weapons for his security.
   ``There were two or three bazookas and a machine gun. Maybe it
was excessive diligence for my care,'' he said.
   In the afternoon, during a surprise visit to the National
Conference of Brazilian Bishops, Castro said the Roman Catholic
Church in Cuba should dedicate itself to the people instead of
``assuming an anti-revolutionary position.''
   Castro told the reporters that in last month or so the Cuban
church has been ``giving signals that it would prefer to
collaborate with the North American church and sectors.'' Following
the changes in Eastern Europe, Castro said those sectors ``spread
the illusion'' that his government will not rule much longer.
   According to Castro, a visit to Cuba by Pope John Paul II is
``practically agreed upon.''
   Castro will visit Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro before leaving
Monday.

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long lines formed around banks and
opposition lawmakers called for an emergency session of Congress
after President Fernando Collor de Mello announced a tough
anti-inflation plan.
   ``Brazilians want serious action now,'' said Collor, who
unveiled the plan Friday, a day after taking office as Brazil's
first popularly elected leader in 29 years.
   The austerity measures include price controls, a new currency,
jail terms for financial and price speculators, and a freeze on
bank savings accounts.
   Higher taxes and utility costs, a severe tightening of the money
supply, cuts in government subsidies and tax incentives were part
of the plan to halt 2,700 percent inflation.
   Government officials on Friday night increased fuel prices 56
percent, telephone rates 32 percent, postal costs 80 percent,
electricity 32 percent and air fares 50 percent.
   ``I'm pretty confused by all this,'' said Wilmar Moreira, 34, a
Sao Paulo taxi driver. ``But I'm still rooting for Collor. What
else can I do?''
   In Rio, the third day of an enforced bank holiday further slowed
business activity Friday. Block-long lines continued to form
throughout the night as residents tried to get the maximum $47 cash
withdrawal to get them through the weekend. Banks were to open
Monday.
   ``The measures are hard. But if they are not adopted,
hyperinflation will set in at extreme social costs,'' Economy
Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello said in a nationally televised
interview Friday night.
   Ms. Cardoso de Mello said salaries this month will be adjusted
to last month's inflation rate, which was 73 percent. Wages and
prices in future months would be adjusted by an amount set by the
government.
   But she failed to provide details about workers salaries, new
tax rates, and the number of workers to be cut from the government
payroll.
   The package drew fire from some economists, labor leaders and
left-wing politicians.
   ``What's going to happen to workers' salaries? They're not going
up as fast as these utility hikes,'' said respected Sao Paulo
economist Joao Paulo Malgalhaes. ``Social instability is a very
real danger.''
   Leaders of the center-left Brazilian Social Democracy Party, the
socialist Workers Party and the Democratic Labor Party pushed for
an emergency weekend session of Congress to review the plan.
   Most of the economic reforms were sent to Congress as
``provisional measures,'' which take effect immediately but can be
voted within 30 days. They also become null if Congress fails to
call a vote within the same period.
   ``The economy will come to a halt and I have no doubt
unemployment will shoot up,'' said Jair Meneguelli, president of
the radical leftist Central Workers Union. ``Once again, the
working man will pay for this package.''
   Initial reactions from businessmen and conservative politicians
were mixed.
   Collor also said the 14-month-old new cruzado would be replaced
by the cruzeiro, the fourth currency in the last four years and
seventh in the country's history.
   The cruzeiro will be equal to one new cruzado, valued at about
2.5 cents officially but about half that on the street.
   In addition, withdrawals from savings accounts would be limited
to $1,200. People with greater savings will not be allowed to get
the rest of their money out for 18 months, during which time it
will earn 6 percent interest plus inflation.
   In his morning address, Collor vowed to eliminate the $31
billion federal budget deficit this year. He decreed the phasing
out of 24 federal agencies and companies, including the steel firm
Siderbras, the Brazilian Institute of Coffee, the Institute of
Sugar and Alcohol, the government's port agency Portobras, and
Interbras, an international trade agency for the oil monopoly
Petrobras.

<HEAD>Governor Ponders Restrictive Abortion Bill as Deadline Nears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion on demand would be illegal in this
U.S. territory if Gov. Joseph Ada fails to veto a bill passed
unanimously by the 21-member Legislature.
   Supporters of legalized abortion have started a campaign to
pressure Ada to cast a veto, while abortion opponents applauded the
legislation.
   ``Clearly the people of Guam don't want abortion on demand and
have made a clear statement on this,'' said Nancy Myers, the
National Right to Life Committee's director of communications in
Washington.
   Ada can veto the most restrictive abortion legislation in the
United States, or sign it into law. If he does neither by midnight
Tuesday, it will become law automatically.
   Under the bill, abortion would be allowed only if a pregnancy
endangers a woman's health. Two independent doctors would have to
give their approval and their decision would have to be reviewed by
a committee appointed by the Guam Medical Licensure Board.
   The bill was amended before approval to provide for a referendum
on the issue in November.
   Janet Benshoof, director of the Reproductive Freedom Project of
the American Civil Liberties Union, was to arrive here Sunday to
lobby against the bill.
   ``Our position is that the bill is patently unconstitutional,''
Rachael Pine, staff attorney for the project, said in New York.
``If the bill becomes law, we expect that it would be struck down
in the lower courts.''
   The ACLU is concerned that the measure could threaten the
landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision which legalized abortion.
   ``Guam seems far away and only a territory, but passage of this
law could take Roe versus Wade away from women all over the
nation.''
   The Legislature approved the bill March 8 after Archbishop
Anthony Apuron threatened to excommunicate any of its 20 Roman
Catholic lawmakers who might vote against it. However, not all of
the legislators were aware of the threat before the vote was taken.
   Myers said her group does not plan to send anyone to Guam to
lobby Ada to sign the bill.
   ``The people of Guam have spoken and we are not going to try to
foist anything on them like the ACLU is doing,'' she said.
   Ada, who is also Roman Catholic, has said the bill will have to
be thoroughly studied by legal experts before he makes a decision.
His deputy chief of staff, Mark Forbes, said the bill is ``a bit
more severe than the governor's personal view.''

   Some Greyhound passengers are riding
low as company and union negotiators opened talks for the first
time since the beginning of the strike punctuated by sniper attacks.
   Negotiators for Greyhound Lines Inc. and the Amalgamated Council
of Greyhound Local Unions met separately Friday in Tucson, Ariz.,
in preparation for face-to-face talks today.
   The talks are the first since 6,300 drivers and about 3,000
other members of the union struck March 2 over wages and grievance
procedures.
   In Chattanooga, two sniper attacks in as many days left some
passengers rattled. Police escorted Greyhound buses into and out of
the southeastern Tennessee city late Thursday after a bullet
shattered the windshield of a bus earlier that day on Interstate 75.
   The sniper attack followed a similar incident Wednesday night,
when two bullets struck the door of a bus on Interstate 24 after it
left the Chattanooga terminal. No one was injured in either attack.
   Christopher Phillippi, a soldier stationed in Frankfurt,
Germany, was returning Friday after a family visit in Chattanooga.
   ``I got to get to where I got to go _ and there's only one way
to do it, unless I hitchhike or something. But I don't know. It
looks like they're getting pretty serious,'' he said.
   Jane Smith, 19, wasn't as nonchalant.
   ``I'll sit in the middle. Not in the front and not in the back _
in the middle,'' Ms. Smith said as she waited for a bus that would
take her through Nashville to Huntsville, Ala.
   ``And I'll sit kind of low, too.''
   Since the strike began, there have been at least 14 shooting
attacks on Greyhound buses, 46 bomb threats and numerous other
incidents of vandalism or threats, according to Greyhound Chairman
Fred G. Currey.
   The latest occurred early Friday when a shot fired from a
passing car hit the windshield of a bus in Phoenix, said Greyhound
spokeswoman Ann Wheat. No one was injured.
   Also Friday, a striking driver was charged with reckless
endangerment and weapons offenses in the shooting of a Greyhound
bus Monday in Farmington, Conn. It was the first arrest in the
shooting attacks.
   Judge Allen Smith ordered Roger D. Cawthra, 44, of Stratford,
held on $100,000 bond. Cawthra, who has said he was innocent,
answered ``yes'' when Smith asked him if he planned to get a lawyer.
   ``I think you're going to need a good one,'' the judge said.
   Striking drivers in Chattanooga say they aren't responsible for
the local attacks.
   ``When I heard about the first one (shooting), I got a sick
feeling. But after this one last night, then it makes you angry,
because we're out here getting our butts kicked, and all this comes
up,'' striker J.W. Kirk said Friday.
   Currey has accused the drivers' union of terrorism and said they
are trying to win the strike through violence and intimidation.
   Greyhound, the nation's only intercity bus company, has been
using permanent replacements and union members willing to cross the
picket line to operate since the strike began.
   The company says 394 union drivers are at work, joining 1,002
permanent replacements. The union says only 94 of its drivers have
crossed the line.
   Greyhound said it carried 47,685 passengers on Thursday, 38.5
percent of the passengers it carried on the same day last year. The
number of departing buses was 1,882, 34.5 percent of the same day
last year. Friday's figures were not available.

   The Southeast faced more thunderstorms today and flooding that
washed out roads, damaged homes, downed power lines and sent
residents in search of higher ground in parts of Georgia, Alabama,
Florida and Mississippi.
   Much of Georgia was under flash flood warnings today after
schools and roads were closed in the state's northwest, where high
winds and falling trees knocked out power and damaged homes.
   Rain early today stretched from the Great Lakes to the central
Gulf Coast and on to the mid-Atlantic states.
   Snow fell in portions of Minnesota and North Dakota.
   The deluge of rain flooded highways and homes in many Alabama
counties. In Coffee County, authorities said virtually all county
roads were unpassable.
   All roads in the Florida county of Santa Rosa were closed Friday
from Milton to the Alabama line.
   About 35 homes in Jackson County, Miss., were flooded by 14
inches of rain that fell in two days, officials said.
   ``There's nothing in the world that can make this stuff drain
off other than gravity,'' said Hank Turk, Jackson County public
safety director.
   Elsewhere, numerous high temperature records for the date were
set, including 82 degrees in Newark, N.J., 82 degrees in Albany,
N.Y., 76 degrees in Baltimore, Md., 90 degrees in Fort Myers, Fla.,
and 82 degrees in New York City.
   The nation's hot spots Friday were Florida's Fort Myers and
Lakeland, which had highs of 90 degrees.

<HEAD>Rights Groups Protest Amnesty For Jailed Soldiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human rights groups are
condemning a proposed amnesty for up to 2,000 former soldiers
jailed for common or politically motivated crimes.
   Amnesty International said the measure, if passed by the
legislature, could free the killers of four U.S churchwomen in
December 1980, as well as those responsible for several massacres.
A report Friday by the London-based human rights group called the
proposal too broad.
   Lilian Alvarado, a member of the Committee of Mothers of
Prisoners, Disappeared and Murdered for Political Reasons, said
passage of the bill ``would be a mockery of the fragile judicial
system and would provoke even more abuses by military men.''
   Right-wing paramilitary squads have been blamed for thousands of
killings of civilians in El Salvador's decade-old civil war.
   A group calling itself the Committee of Prisoners of Ex-Members
of the Armed Forces presented a petition for amnesty to a
legislative committee Dec. 8, but the proposal was not made public
until this week.
   Mario Amaya, president of the committee, said at least several
weeks of study were needed on the bill.
   It has the support of rightist Ricardo Alvarenga, president of
the legislature.
   ``We want peace; we want tranquility. If for whatever reason
these people find themselves in this situation, I think we could
give them the opportunity to reincorporate themselves into
society,'' he said.
   The petition for amnesty was signed by 80 former members of the
armed forces either serving sentences or awaiting trial for a wide
range of felonies, the vast majority of them common crimes.
   Under Salvadoran law, a soldier convicted of a felony is
automatically dismissed from the armed forces.
   The ex-soldiers argued in their petition that an amnesty granted
in October 1987 benefited leftist rebels exclusively.
   About 200 political prisoners were freed under that measure, as
were about the same number of former military men. About 2,000
soldiers remain in prison.
   In its report, Amnesty International argued the earlier amnesty
helped military veterans more than its did leftist guerrillas.
   It said guerrillas had only 15 days to turn themselves in and
receive amnesty while the military ``who had not even been accused
of any crime were absolved in the unlikely event they might be
prosecuted sometime in the future.''
   The Christian Democratic Party, which handed power last year to
the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance following elections,
has also come out against the proposal for a new amnesty.

   A 90-year-old man died of complications
from severe burns after undergoing 20 minutes of ultraviolet light
therapy in a doctor's office.
   Henry Homer, a retired furniture dealer from Chicago, was only
scheduled for 20 seconds of treatment for psoriasis, a skin
condition.
   Homer died of an infection brought on by the burns, according to
an autopsy report by Dr. Bruce Hyma of the Dade County Medical
Examiner's Office. Prostate cancer and the skin condition
contributed to the death, Hyma said.
   ``They put him in there and forgot about him,'' said one of
Homer's sons, Mel, 66.
   An attorney for the doctor said Friday that Homer, having had
previous treatments, should have known to leave the booth sooner.
   ``The patient knew he was undergoing treatment for only 20
seconds and he was free to walk out of the box at any moment,''
said Stuart Grossman, attorney for Dr. Phillip Frost.
   Frost didn't respond to a telephone request for comment.
   Homer got the ultraviolet light treatment at Frost's office at
Mount Sinai Medical Center on Feb. 16, said Mel Homer.
   Frost's staff had Homer take off his clothes and get into the
telephone booth-sized enclosure, but didn't return to get him out,
and Homer finally left on his own, the son said.
   Homer, who suffered first- and second-degree burns everywhere
except the soles of his feet, was immediately admitted to the
hospital, relatives said. He died March 9.
   Miami Beach police Detective Paul Scrimshaw is conducting what
he called ``an open death investigation.''
   The booth was in a private office in the hospital, said Mount
Sinai spokeswoman Lori Fagenholz, when asked for comment. Hospital
officials were investigating, but intended to keep their findings
confidential, said hospital attorney A. Budd Cutler.

<HEAD>Roh Replaces 15 Cabinet Members, Aiming To Revitalize Economy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo today replaced
15 Cabinet members, including his senior economic aide, in an
attempt to revive the country's sluggish economy.
   Among the changes, Roh replaced Deputy Premier and Economic
Planning Minister Cho Soon, who has been criticized for policies
that caused high inflation, land speculation and slow exports.
   In his place, Roh named Lee Seung-yun, a former finance minister
under the administration of former President Chun Doo-hwan.
Government officials say Lee is likely to lower interest rates and
provide more financial incentives to stimulate exports, which fell
2.5 percent in the first two months of the year.
   ``The problems we face now are complex and need time to be
solved but I think priority must be directed at encouraging
investment and stimulating exports,'' Lee told reporters.
   The Cabinet changes had been anticipated after last month's
merger of Roh's governing party with two centrist opposition
groups. The new conservative party gave the president a comfortable
parliamentary majority.
   The change followed the resignation Friday of Prime Minister
Kang Young-hoon and his entire 22-member Cabinet.
   Roh retained the prime minister, defense chief and foreign
minister but changed 15 of the Cabinet posts, including most of
those involving the economy. Chief presidential spokesman Lee
Soo-jung said
   The changes reflected Roh's determination to revive the sagging
economy, chief presidential spokesman Lee Soo-jung said. The
spokesman said it was also aimed at invigorating national politics
as Roh enters the second half of his five-year term, which ends in
early 1993.
   Ahn Ung-mo, a deputy director of the Agency for National
Security Planning, the government's main intelligence body, was
named the new home minister. The home minister controls the
country's 130,000-member national police force.
   Park Pil-soo, a former government economic official, became the
minister of trade and industry and Chung Young-ui, 53, chief of the
Securities Supervisory Agency, was appointed as the finance
minister.
   The reorganization affected the presidential staff, including
Roh's chief secretary, Hong Sung-chul, who was named to head the
National Unification Board, which handles negotiations with
Communist North Korea.

   On the day honoring Ireland's patron saint, St. Patrick, a green
line on New York City's streets showed the way for 125,000 parade
marchers and an old Irish club in Springfield, Mass., prepared to
elect its first female president.
   The 229th St. Patrick's Day parade steps up Manhattan's Fifth
Avenue today. Police expected 2 million spectators.
   While the parade will lack the political fireworks of past
years, it included some controversy. Irish Republican Army soldier
Joseph Doherty was spending his seventh St. Patrick's Day in the
Metropolitan Correctional Center, and his supporters were expected
to call for his release.
   At the 253-year-old Charitable Irish Society in Springfield,
Mass., members tonight were to inaugurate Catherine B. Shannon as
president.
   ``I think they feel it's about time,'' said William Connaughton,
a former president of the Boston-based society, which began
admitting women in the early 1980s.
   ``I think that what happened was there were a lot of men who
were coming onto the board who were in their 40s and 50s who said,
`This is ridiculous. Stag dinners are not that much fun,''' said
Shannon, a Westfield State College professor. Her field of study is
Irish history, but she also has researched the role of women in
modern Ireland.
   In Boston on Friday, officials dedicated a spot in Quincy Market
for a statue of a mother and child to memorialize Irish famine
victims and to serve as a reminder of the world's hunger crisis.
   ``Rather than locate a memorial to such a great human tragedy in
some forgotten corner, I felt it was important that it be placed in
a location where people who live in Boston and who visit here would
perhaps stop and think and be reminded of what hunger and
oppression mean to a people,'' Mayor Raymond Flynn said.
   The 12-foot statue will be the first American memorial to those
who died during the Irish famine, Flynn said.

   A tired Stormie Jones, the world's first
recipient of a heart-lung transplant, returned home with thanks to
well-wishers and a stuffed bear in tow after a month's recovery
from a second liver transplant.
   The 12-year-old rode in a wheelchair and clutched a gray koala
bear named Nathan as she spoke briefly to reporters Friday night at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
   ``Go to bed,'' Stormie said when asked what she wanted to do
first.
   Supporters shouted ``Good luck!'' and ``We're glad you're home!''
   Stormie, who lives in the Fort Worth suburb of White Settlement,
spent the past couple of weeks at Ronald McDonald House in
Pittsburgh after her discharge from Children's Hospital there.
   ``I want to thank everybody, and I mean everybody, in the world
that thinks about donating an organ. Here's proof it works,'' said
Alan Purcell, Stormie's stepfather.
   Stormie's first donor liver, which was damaged by hepatitis
caused by an unknown virus, was replaced during 10 hours of surgery
Feb. 20 at Children's Hospital. The next day she returned to
surgery to stop internal bleeding.
   Her second liver transplant came six years after the historic
heart and liver transplant. The original operation was needed to
control the effects of a rare disease that left Stormie's
cholesterol levels 10 times greater than normal and damaged her
heart.
   Stormie's parents looked forward to some peace and quiet.
   ``We're going to go home, turn off everything and hide,''
Purcell said.
   Purcell said he expects Stormie to be better than ever.
   ``The liver is better than it has ever been,'' he said. `It's
perfect.''

   A bomb exploded in the office of a
government-run union office in the Angolan capital of Luanda,
killing a 6-year-old child and wounding five people, news reports
said today.
   There were no immediate claims of responsibility in the
explosion, the fourth in Luanda in three months. Angolan rebels,
who have claimed responsibility for several bombings in Luanda,
recently announced they would step up urban guerrilla attacks in
response to a government troop offensive.
   The Lisbon daily Diario de Noticias said the bomb exploded
Friday in the ground-floor offices of the government-run transport
and communications trade union in downtown Luanda.
   The Portuguese news agency Lusa said the explosion sprayed
debris over a 120-foot radius. It said the child died instantly,
and four women and an old man were taken to a hospital.
   The guerrilla movement, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, has been fighting to share power with the
Marxist government since the African nation gained independence
from Portugal in 1975.

   Technicians prepared space shuttle
Discovery for a mock countdown, but engineers still had to check
whether the space plane's landing gear needed repair.
   The five astronauts who will fly Discovery are to arrive at the
Kennedy Space Center Sunday for a three-day training session that
includes a dress rehearsal of launch day. They will be inside the
shuttle for the final hours of a mock countdown Tuesday.
   Discovery began its rollout to the launch pad Thursday night and
finished the 3.5-mile trek early Friday, NASA said.
   The shuttle is scheduled to lift off April 12 on a five-day
mission to deploy the $1.5 billion Hubble space telescope. From
space, the telescope will be able to see galaxies distant enough to
provide scientists with clues about the beginning of the universe.
   But officials of the National Aeronautics and Space
Adminsitration fear a problem with the nose wheels of two sister
ships could keep Discovery on the ground. Engineers still do not
know whether Discovery's nose wheel contains a faulty axle nut like
the ones inspectors found on Columbia and Atlantis Thursday. If it
does, they said it cannot be repaired at the launch pad.
   Columbia's axle assembly was sent to its manufacturer to
determine whether the worn part is a flight safety hazard.
Officials do not expect to have a determination before Monday.
   The crew is composed of Air Force Col. Loren Shriver, the
commander; Marine Col. Charles Bolden, the pilot; and mission
specialists Steven Hawley, Kathryn Sullivan and Navy Capt. Bruce
McCandless.

<TEXT>
   The anti-apartheid African National
Congress today said it will meet with South African President F.W.
de Klerk to discuss the political future of that the country.
   The guerrilla-backed organization made its stand clear as
Lusaka, the Zambian capital, prepared for three days of high-level
diplomatic initiatives towards a change in the balance of political
power in South Africa.
   ANC spokesman Tom Sebina said in an interview that nothing would
stand in the way of the scheduled preliminary discussions April 11
in South Africa between the white-led government and the ANC.
   Sebina's comments came a day after de Klerk announced Nelson
Mandela and other ANC leaders were invited to the talks as a step
towards formal power-sharing negotiations.
   Lusaka has been the headquarters of the ANC, the biggest
movement in conflict with the Pretoria government since it was
outlawed 30 years ago.
   De Klerk last month freed Mandela from 27 years' imprisonment
for anti-government activities and legalized the ANC and other
groups. Mandela, 71, returned home to South Africa today to prepare
for the talks after a visit to Sweden.
   De Klerk said he wants to negotiate a new constitution that will
bring the voteless black majority of 28 million into the national
government. But he also wants the 5 million whites to wield veto
power over major policy decisions.
   In Lusaka, the ANC spokesman said its delegation would include
leaders based both inside and outside South Africa.
   The aim of the preliminary negotiations, Sebina said, was to
discuss the removal of obstacles in the path of formal talks on the
political future of the country.
   The ANC seeks the end of the 3{-year-old state of emergency, the
release of all other political prisoners and the withdrawal of army
troops from black townships as preconditions for formal discussions.
   Sebina said the April 11 talks would be between only the
government and the ANC. He maintained other anti-apartheid would
not be included.
   Once the preliminary stage has been passed, he said, ``the ANC
has always maintained that the process of negotiations will be
democratic in itself.''
   ``If other anti-apartheid organizations want to present their
positions on a democratic future South Africa they are welcome to
join us around the negotiating table,'' he added.
   Previously, Pretoria has said other leaders including those of
the 10 black homelands would be at talks.
   One of these, Zulu political leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi spent
his second day in Lusaka today at the invitation of President
Kenneth Kaunda. They were expected to confer on South Africa.
   Buthelezi, a conservative advocate of capitalism who represents
many of the 7 million Zulus of the KwaZulu homeland in eastern
South Africa, opposes ANC violence and the movement's calls for
international sanctions against their country.
   About 3,000 people have been killed in violence between Zulus,
the biggest black tribe, and the ANC since 1986.
   After arriving Friday night, Buthelezi told Kaunda that while he
differed with Mandela on some issues he held the ANC leader in
``high regards.''
   Buthelezi arrived at a time when Zambia was geared up for other
diplomatic initiatives on South Africa. Angola, Botswana,
Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe hold a summit Sunday.
   Another meeting is planned Monday by the 50-member Organization
of African Unity's southern Africa committee, to be led by OAU
chief President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
   Also Monday, talks are expected between African leaders and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who is to stop over
in Lusaka on his way to the March 21 independence celebrations in
Namibia.

   Police said they foiled a St.

bomb. Two explosions occurred today, but no one was injured.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said a patrol arrested a man
acting suspiciously in Coalisland, County Tyrone, in the early
hours today and discovered the barrel bomb.
   While the device was being made safe, police said people from a
nearby boxing club threw bottles and stones at officers, who
responded by firing plastic bullets.
   One woman was arrested and three policemen were slightly
injured, police said. The constabulary gave no other details on the
incident.
   On the Fermanagh border with the Republic of Ireland, police
said security forces were investigating an explosion heard early
today.
   In Londonderry, the British province's second-largest city,
windows in several houses were shattered in the Shantallow district
when a bomb was thrown at a mobile police patrol. No one was
injured, police said.
   St. Patrick is Ireland's patron saint.

<TEXT>
   The Warsaw Pact met today on the
eve of East Germany's elections to discuss German unification, its
impact on Europe and the two military blocs that have divided the
continent for more than 40 years.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and his six
colleagues opened the day's brainstorming session by meeting with
President Vaclav Havel, a leading advocate of the eventual
dissolution of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   The official news agency CTK said Havel presented unspecified
proposals concerning proposed German unity and the future of a
united Europe, and that these were ``exceptionally well received''
by the foreign ministers.
   The ministers then went into a closed-door meeting at a
luxurious former Communist Party hotel.
   Since a peaceful revolution overturned the Communist monopoly on
power in Czechoslovakia in December, Havel and his foreign
minister, Jiri Dienstbier, have swiftly moved to center stage in
East-West politics, visiting European capitals and the superpowers
to preach the ideas of a bloc-free Europe that arise from
philosophies they developed as dissidents.
   After receiving the ministers, Havel flew off to the mountains
on the Polish border for a meeting with Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa. Only a year ago, such meetings between Czechoslovak and
Polish dissidents were conducted in secret, and almost always
watched or broken up by police.
   Today's Warsaw Pact gathering came on the eve of East Germany's
first free elections since Adolf Hitler took power in Germany in
1933, and two days after Havel and West German President Richard
von Weizsaecker met in Prague on the 51st anniversary of Hitler's
invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   That meeting served as a further gesture of reconciliation
between Prague and the two Germanys, following Havel's visit _ his
first trip abroad as president _ to East Berlin and Munich in
January.
   While Czechoslovakia and Hungary have stressed they do not
oppose German unification, both countries have strongly advocated
that Poland be included in the ``two-plus-four'' talks on German
unification, and that West Germany should respect Poland's current
borders. The talks involve the two Germanys and the four World War
II Allies: the United States, the Soviets, Britain and France.
   The history of all the states in the Warsaw Pact is deeply
intertwined with Germany's centuries-long evolution from a series
of small principalities and dukedoms into a strong empire, then a
Nazi dictatorship, and now the potential 80-million-strong
superpower of Europe.
   Polish memories of the country's suffering at the hands of the
Germans in World War II have prompted Warsaw to demand a say in the
process of German unification, and made Poland's Solidarity-led
government reluctant to follow Czechoslovakia and Hungary into
negotiating a withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   Czechoslovaks, too, remember their Nazi occupation with
bitterness, while Germans recall the post-World War II expulsion of
almost 3 million Germans from the Sudeten territories along
Czechoslovakia's current northwestern, western and southern borders.

<HEAD>Police Fire on Rioting Hindus and Moslems; At Least 1 Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities opened fire on Hindus and
Moslems who rioted in a dispute over a cremation ground in southern
New Delhi, and police said that at least one person was killed and
several people were injured.
   United News of India news agency said two people were killed and
20 injured in the clash, but police could not confirm those figures.
   ``As of now we have only one dead,'' said a police spokesman who
cannot be identified under standing regulations. He didn't have an
exact injury total.
   The trouble began when residents of the predominantly Moslem
Nizamuddin neighborhood objected to a group of Hindus trying to
extend the boundary of their cremation ground, according to the
reports from United News.
   The news agency said arguments turned into a clash, which was
broken up by the police. But minutes later the mob regrouped and
hurled stones at the police who retaliated by opening fire, United
News said.
   The police spokesman said he was not aware of the sequence of
events.
   United News said an 11-year-old Moslem boy, Mohammad Hanif, and
an unidentified person were killed. The boy was shot in the back,
the report said.
   Neither the news agency nor the police spokesman characterized
the trouble as a Hindu-Moslem clash, but such communal clashes
periodically occur in India. At least 400 people were killed in
Hindu-Moslem fights in India last year.
   Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people. Hindus
account for 82 percent.

   Givenchy's splendid sophistication and Karl
Lagerfeld's leggy mini styles gave pizazz to runways in a day of
winter ready-to-wear fashion shows memorable for both casual-sport
and dressy looks.
   The trends are emerging: Minis are still very much in.
Drawstring anoraks and hooded parkas, flying babydoll toppers and
trapeze coats paired with cigarette-slim pants are other silhouette
choices in the panoply of fashion.
   Givenchy woke the audience up at a 9 a.m. show on Friday that
sparkled with chic, showing that ``BCBG'' women _ the French
expression meaning upper-class _ can be sexy.
   The knitwear was wonderful, featuring lean dresses, pantsuits,
capes and tunics with skirts in a vaguely tiger-striped pattern of
shades like rust, cornflower blue or violet.
   For the Cole Porter fans who love nostalgia, Givenchy paraded
wonderful fitted suits with shiny cobra jackets to the tune of
``Easy to Love.''
   Those looking for originality would also love his pantsuits,
with ribbed-knit loose toppers featuring colorful diamond-patterned
panels in front. He also paired bright knits and leathers in
elegant bolero or fitted-jacket suits.
   His green or purple easily-fitted slim suits with black-piped
chenille jackets were another great look here, along with the shiny
bronze trench coats, and the tiger-striped shiny suits.
   And for late-day wear, Givenchy went in for total couture,
sometimes bordering on ``Dynasty'' extravagance. These opulent
styles included sexily-draped lame-spotted chiffons, strapless
brocade cocktail dresses with jackets, rhinestones, brocade and all
the expensive accoutrements, including ostrich and egret feathers.
   Karl Lagerfeld is on a youth kick. His main idea, of skinny
minis or shorts, came out this time in colorful jerseys and knits
worn with opaque tights and suede boots covering the knee. It was
often a charming look back at ``Tom Jones'' and the 1960s.
   The favorite jacket was the ``Amazon'' or fitted, flared
l9th-century redingote sidesaddle riding coat, and he even cut one
side of the jacket short for a rider in some asymmetrical models.
   Among the terrific jackets were the hip-length red blousons,
slightly fitted tulip-wrapped jackets, handsome black velvet-piped
long jackets in cornflower blue or corn yellow.
   Short cutaways and little boleros with raglan sleeves and shawl
collars were good in black-and-white nubbly weaves or big plaids.
Sometimes a tiny pleated or flared mini peeped under the longer
jackets.
   Lagerfeld's best evening looks included long shocking pink satin
jackets or very long princess coats over black minis.
   Bernard Perris's ``Prologue'' line featured currently
fashionable drawstring jackets, narrow knit stirrup pants, and fake
fur collars on fitted jackets. Hooded and fringed plaid big jackets
or quilted toppers over the leggings were other lines here in a
line that featured popular Paris colors like rust, pine, khaki and
petrol blue.
   Noteworthy were his camouflage-spotted anoraks over jumpsuits,
his fitted spencer jackets with puffy accordion-knit pleated
sleeves. He also took this pleated puffy look into evening in
combinations of taffeta and velvet, though the results looked like
``forced fashion'' rather than a fashion force.
   The Chloe collection by Martine Sitbon was also strong in the
skinny line of ski pants, or short suits in tricolor combinations,
topped by hooded wide duster jackets.
   Man-tailored trouser outfits were tempered by interesting fabric
combinations like pink-brown-green plaid jackets over striped
classic pants in the same tones.
   A new Italian-American designer, Carmelo Pomodoro, gave a series
of low-keyed shows of easy sportswear and cozy clothes in his Paris
debut.
   The 34-year-old Pomodoro, who trained at the Parsons School of
Design in New York, is backed by the big Japanese company
Takashimaya and has opened his first store in Tokyo, with plans to
expand soon in Paris and New York.
   Little jersey tunics, tights and easy flared duster jackets had
a quiet appeal in shades like cream, curry or khaki. The effect was
fluid and casual rather than tailored or uptight.
   ``I also designed a `granny line' to honor my grandmother,''
said Pomodoro, who showed some full-skirted long dresses, crocheted
toppers and touches of lace.
   Look for his super soft-wool lace tunics worn as minis _ they're
new, young and feminine.
   Popy Moreni, another young designer with an Italian background,
laid on a high-spirited collection based on Indian folklore themes.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief of an all-party watchdog commission
has assured voters that East Germany's first free elections will be
fraud-proof, seeking to allay distrust in a country accustomed to
Communist vote-rigging.
   Also today, a West German newspaper said the East Berlin
government is seeking an immediate bailout to prevent economic
collapse.
   ``East Germany urgently needs 5 billion marks ($2.94 billion) to
provide for the population and prevent economic collapse,'' the
Berliner Morgenpost said. It said the caretaker government had
given a ``position paper'' to West Germany, detailing its needs.
   Most campaigning ended Friday, but a few political parties
planned final pitches today, the eve of balloting that will give
East Germany its first freely elected Parliament since its founding
in 1949 and complete the transition from Communist rule.
   Sunday's vote is for a new 400-seat Parliament, which could
decide the pace of unification with West Germany.
   Some conservative parties urge quick unification. Some leftist
groups are for a more cautious and slower approach. All major
parties support unification.
   An estimated 12.3 million voters are eligible to choose from
among 24 parties and groupings. Election helpers completed work on
the 22,000 polling stations nationwide.
   The Communists are expected to end up in an opposition role.
   Party chief Gregor Gysi wound up their campaign with a rally
before thousands of people in East Berlin. He called for a united
Germany to remain outside the Western military alliance, echoing
Moscow's stand, and recalled the social safety net set up under
Communist rule.
   Petra Blaess, head of an all-party election oversight
commission, told a news conference all measures have been taking to
ensure against vote fraud.
   ``In the Berlin computer center, there are no possibilities for
manipulation in the transmitting and compiling of the results from
the voting districts,'' said Blaess, a 25-year-old student.
   Three members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France,
will also act as election observers.
   The delegation's leader, Danish parliamentarian Kirsten Jensen,
told the East German news agency ADN she did not fear ``anything
undemocratic'' could happen in the balloting.
   Vote fraud remains a touchy subject in East Germany. Rigging in
local elections in May is considered a main factor in the autumn
uprising that toppled hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker,
opened the Berlin Wall and launched the reform process.
   A nationwide survey published Friday suggested nearly half of
all East Germans favor immediate unification, although a third of
the electorate would prefer a slower joining of the two states _
split into Communist East and capitalist West Germany after the
World War II defeat of Nazi Germany.
   The poll found that 84 percent favored unification in general,
according to a survey conducted jointly by the Central Institute
for Youth Research and the Institute for Market Research, both from
Leipzig.
   According to recent polls, front-runners are the leftist Social
Democrats and the Alliance for Germany, a coalition of three
conservative parties.
   Those two forces mirror the mainstream parties in West Germany,
the Christian Democrats of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the Social
Democrats, who include the hugely popular former Chancellor Willy
Brandt.
   The West German parties poured heavy campaign support into East
Germany. They are using the vote as a prelude for West German
elections in December and to build up power bases in the east
before expected unification.
   Balloting in East Germany was originally scheduled for May, but
with state authority collapsing rapidly, the date was moved up.
   Kohl on Friday called East Germany's elections a ``destiny
vote'' on the road to German unification, and promised to protect
East Germans from hardship during their nation's economic overhaul.

   Lithuania's president today renewed his call for
negotiations with the Kremlin on independence, while nationalists
in the fellow Baltic republics of Estonia and Latvia prepared for
parliamentary elections Sunday.
   Lithuania's legislature elected former president Algirdas
Brazauskas to the post of deputy premier and named former Communist
Kazimira Prunskene, who quit the party, to the post of premier.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in a telegram on Friday
demanded that Lithuania return to the Soviet fold within three
days. He declined to say what the Kremlin would do if Lithuania
refused, but he and his aides have ruled out the use of force. The
republic declared its independence Sunday.
   ``The cable sent by President Gorbachev and addressed to the
Lithuanian Supreme Soviet sounds very much like pressure being
applied on us,'' Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis told his
republic's Supreme Council.
   But, Landsbergis said: ``We remember Gorbachev's words about a
dialgoue with Lithuania,'' and the cable could be interpreted as a
beginning of the negotiating process.
   He was quoted by Eduardas Patashinskas, a Lithuanian television
editor who attended the session.
   The Soviet Parliament issued a proclamation on Thursday saying
that Lithuania's declaration was invalid.
   Landsbergis accused the parliament of treating Lithuania ``like
a naughty girl'' and said the independent Supreme Council would
continue its work while waiting for the Kremlin to respond to its
calls for negotiations.
   As for Gorbachev's cable, he said: ``It can only be remarked
that it was sent to the wrong address because we are no longer the
Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic.''
   When the republic declared its independence on Sunday, lawmakers
changed its name to the Republic of Lithuania and renamed their
legislature the Supreme Council.
   As Lithuania grappled with its newly declared independence,
Estonia and Latvia prepared for Supreme Soviet elections Sunday. A
strong pro-independence vote was expected.
   A pro-independence rally in the Latvian capital, Riga, this
afternoon was peaceful and orderly, said a spokesman for the
grassroots Peoples Front.
   In the Estonian capital, Tallinn, a pro-independence rally was
held by several hundred nationalists on the eve of elections. ``It
was calm,'' said Popular Front spokesman Michael Tarm.
   In elections held in December, pro-independence movements in the
two republics won up to half the seats in local governments, a
signal that they could take a large number of parliamentary seats
in Sunday's vote.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of people marched through
Baghdad and surrounded the British Embassy today to protest
Britain's outcry over Iraq's execution of a London-based journalist.
   They shouted chants and carried placards praising the hanging
Thursday of Farzad Bazoft, 31, who was arrested while researching
an article on a military complex and convicted in a closed trial of
spying for Britain and Israel.
   Officials of the ruling Baath Socialist Party, which organized
the rally, estimated 100,000 people turned out. State TV reported
anti-British demonstrations in other cities.
   There were no reports of violence.
   The sprawling, walled embassy compound on the western bank of
the Tigris River was ringed by police officers and plainclothes
security agents. They blocked the main entrance to the compound
with their cars. No embassy personnel could be seen.
   President Saddam Hussein's party called for nationwide
demonstrations after Britain denounced Bazoft's execution as
barbaric, recalled Ambassador Harold Walker, expelled six Iraqi
military trainees and halted all visits to Baghdad by government
officials.
   However, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government resisted
demands to sever relations and impose economic sanctions on Iraq,
with which Britain has a nearly $500 million trade surplus.
   Western nations and human rights groups also denounced the
execution, but Arab newspapers and Jordan's King Hussein today
defended it.
   ``We hope that the numerous efforts which we see ... that aim at
mistreating Iraq, not just in this case but in others, will ease,''
the king said. ``There has been a concentrated attack on Iraq for a
long period of time without any reason to justify it.''
   Qatar's al-Sharq, echoing other publications in the Persian Gulf
region, said: ``There is no excuse for this campaign, which is but
an attempt not only to undermine Iraq but the rest of the Arab
states ... in international forums.''
   Residents in Basra, in southern Iraq, and Mosul, in the north,
contacted by telephone reported thousands of demonstrators were in
the streets chanting anti-British slogans.
   Like the thousands who jammed Baghdad's main thoroughfares,
marchers in Basra and Mosul chanted slogans hailing Hussein, who
ignored international appeals for clemency for Bazoft.
   The demonstrators chanted that British ``talk is nonsense ...
Your spy has already been hanged.''
   Sadi Mehdi Saleh, the parliament speaker and Baath party chief
in the capital, told The Associated Press the demonstration was
designed to show Britain that Iraqis were united behind Hussein and
his decision to enforce the court verdict.
   Bazoft, an Iranian-born reporter for the weekly The Observer who
traveled on British documents, was arrested in September while he
was investigating reports of a major explosion at a secret Iraqi
military research complex south of Baghdad.
   The Iraqis accused Bazoft of spying for Britain and Israel and
he was sentenced to death by a closed-door security court earlier
this month. A British nurse who drove him to the complex, Daphne
Parish, 53, was sentenced to 15 years in prison.
   Bazoft made a public confession on Iraqi TV but later retracted
it and denied he was engaged in espionage.
   His colleagues say he was working only as a reporter.

   Nelson Mandela returned today
from his foreign trip to face a nation wracked by factional
fighting and the task of preparing for the first formal talks
between black leaders and the white government.
   Mandela deplored the wave of violence that has claimed hundreds
of lives recently and said the growing black unrest was a revolt
against the white government's repressive rule.
   He said he would try to stop the bloody violence in black
townships and tribal homelands, but he declined to say what
measures his African National Congress would consider to restore
calm.
   The violence will end if the government permits ``peaceful
agitation,'' Mandela told an airport news conference. Government
policy has ``no popular support whatsover,'' he said.
   About 300 people have been killed in fighting in the past month
in black townships and the tribal homelands. Most of the fighting
has been between rival black factions.
   Mandela, his wife, Winnie, and a small entourage were embraced
by waiting black officials and greeted with raised fists by airport
workers at the stairs of the Swissair jet that brought them from
Sweden.
   In Stockholm, he spent five days consulting with African
National Congress President Oliver Tambo, who is recovering from a
stroke.
   Mandela, 71, was elected deputy president of the ANC when he
began his five-nation tour in Zambia early this month, and he is
effective leader of the largest black opposition group until Tambo
recuperates.
   Mandela is expected to lead the ANC delegation of internal and
exiled officials who will meet April 11 with President F.W. de
Klerk. The purpose of the talks will be to clear away obstacles to
formal negotiations on a new constitution and an end to apartheid.
   At a Stockholm rally Friday night, Mandela urged increased
foreign pressure on the South African government to meet the ANC's
conditions for negotiations, including lifting the national state
of emergency, freeing all prisoners convicted of politically
motivated crimes, and guaranteeing returning exiles won't be
arrested.
   Mandela shortened his Swedish visit by one day in order to get
to Johannesburg in time for a large rally and concert in his honor
today.

   A car ran off a back road and plunged into
a rain-swollen creek where a bridge had washed out, killing the six
people aboard, authorities said today.
   The driver apparently did not realize the bridge on the county
road between Florala and Samson was gone and drove into the creek
between 10:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. Friday, said Coroner Norman Hobson.
   ``There was a small barrier there, but nobody knows whether it
was put up before or after the wreck,'' he said.
   Hobson identified the dead as a man and wife, their 14-year-old
child and three other people who apparently were not related. He
declined to release the victims' names pending notification of
relatives.
   The six had left South Carolina earlier Friday for their homes
near Florala, about 100 miles due south of Montgomery near the
Florida state line, he said.
   ``Undoubtedly they didn't realize how bad the weather was,''
Hobson said.
   A man who lives near the bridge saw the car's rear lights
sticking out of the water and notified police.
   Thunderstorms that began Thursday had dumped up to a foot of
rain in southern Alabama, washing out roads and bridges and causing
flooding in low-lying areas.

<BYLINE>Castro Still Has Strong Following But Questions Linger
^By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAVANA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blackouts have been on the increase lately in a
tough, rundown neighborhood on Havana's east side.
   And to some, that could be a political omen. With the blackout
of communism in Eastern Europe now virtually complete, is Cuba next?
   For his part, President Fidl Castro is convinced that communism
is here to stay. He confidently asserts that those who think
otherwise have always underestimated Cuban resolve.
   But even stalwart admirers of the revolution admit the country
faces greater uncertainty now than at any time in years. Cuba is
suffering from ideological and political isolation. The economy has
been in decline for years and there are doubts about Cuba's
relations with its chief benefector, the Soviet Union.
   Nonetheless, Castro is still able to claim the allegience of
millions of his countrymen. His support level is substantial, at
least when compared with that of Eastern Europe's former
leadership, which passed into history last year seemingly unmourned
by their subjects.
   Still, most Cubans agree that backing for the revolution has
waned since the heady early days. Hardships abound here. Buyying
food or getting to work or making a phone call can be major
undertakings. Everything is scarce except grumbling, or so it seems.
   The number of Cubans fleeing for Miami on boats has been
averaging 40 a month, a sharp increase. ``People can subsist but
not live,'' says Jorge Luis Pichardo, 26, who fled Cuba last August
for Florida on a raft.
   But Castro, to many, remains the embodiment of Cuban
nationalism, the leader who brought justice and dignity to a
country which once had little of either. Castro's mystique is such
that anyone who judges his support based on Cuba's economic
indicators is using the wrong approach.
   Many Cubans feel Castro has rescued them from certain oblivion.
Juan Aizpura Rodriguez was a 15-year old grade school dropout with
little hope at the time of the revolution.
   He now boasts a college degree and a prestige job as a member of
the national directorate of one of Cuba's mass organizations.
   ``If it weren't for the revolution, the masses would be
suffering,'' Aizpura says.
   And, as the Cuban media constantly points out, the socialist
regimes in Eastern Europe were tainted from the start, having been
imposed by Moscow after World War II. In contrast, the view here is
that the Cuban revolution is legitimate because it was home grown.
   Castro's message these days is that those who look on the
revolution as a ``house of cards'' vulnerable to the slightest
breeze are dead wrong.
   There was some evidence to support that thesis last Tuesday
evening when about 50,000 students gathered in front of the
presidential palace to commemorate a revolutionary
anniversary.Attendance at such events is prudent in a country where
people, especially students, often are judged by their
revolutionary zeal.
   But the enthusiasm written on the faces and heard in the
patriotic chants as Castro spoke seemed genuine. Even after three
decades, Castro has not lost his ability to hypnotyze audiences.
   Castro is not one to retreat in the face of adversity. Rather
than copy the reforms now common in Eastern Europe, Castro has
become more assertive than ever in his defense of socialism.
   For decades, he ended his speeches with: ``Fatherland or
death.'' Now there is a supplement: ``Socialism or death.''
   But Castro's speeches suggest a strong sense that the unexpected
may happen, that the government has to be increasingly
vigilant.Human rights activists who once had some room to manuever
now find themselves the targets of mass protests. Most of the rest
are either in jail or intimidated.
   How many support the activists? How many would welcome a change
in the system? Given the closed nature of Cuban society, those
questions may be unanswerable.
   The revolution's future may well be decided by forces beyond
Cuba's control.
   The Soviet Union has been an extraordinarily reliable patron for
Cuba for years, contributing an average of $5 billion annually in
economic help. A recent Izvestia article said the Cuba's debt to
the Soviets was $24.7 billion.
   Add the estimated $7 billion owed to Western banks and Cuba
emerges as one of the most heavily indebted countries per capita, a
nation whose ambtious social welfare program has been built largely
with borrowed money.
   If the widely predicted scaling down of Soviet help to Cuba is
carried out and living standards decline, diplomats wonder whether
Castro's charisma will be enough to placate his countrymen.
   But Foreign Ministry officials say Soviet-Cuban relations are as
strong as ever despite the revisionist policies of President
Mikhail Gorbachev and that Moscow has promised to continue abiding
by its economic commitments.
   Castro, though, is taking no chances, warning that extreme belt
tightening measures may be required if Moscow is forced to cut back.

<TEXT>
   Less than a year after Namibia was
ablaze with a war and wracked by seemingly insurmountable ethnic
differences, the territory is ready for a peaceful transition to
independence from South Africa this week.
   The diverse people of this vast, arid land have set aside their
weapons and begun working together to transform Africa's last
colony into one of the continent's few democracies. Independence
officially begins Wednesday.
   ``We confounded the doubters,'' said Sam Nujoma, the territory's
designated president, who led the South-West Africa People's
Organization during its 23-year guerrilla war against South African
rule.
   Black nationalist guerrillas and right-wing whites who once
fought each other have been preaching reconciliation in what has
been a remarkably smooth approach to independence for Namibia,
formerly known as South-West Africa.
   ``We have accepted that South-West Africa as we knew it will be
replaced by an independent Namibia,'' said Jan de Wet, leader of
the right-wing National Party. ``We are glad to offer our skills
and resources to this country if we are welcome.''
   SWAPO often was depicted by whites as a ``Marxist-terrorist''
organization during the war. But since winning U.N.-supervised
elections in November, the leftist organization has made numerous
compromises in an attempt to accommodate the 11 distinct ethnic
groups that make up Namibia's 1.3 million people.
   SWAPO's support comes predominantly from the northern Ovambo
tribe, but Nujoma also has named blacks who are not Ovambos to key
positions to allay fears that SWAPO will be a tribal-based
government. He also has appointed whites and businessmen from
opposition parties to his Cabinet.
   ``The future government wants to ensure that ... policies and
laws will be supported by the widest possible cross-section of the
population,'' said Otto Herrigel, a German-descended Namibian who
will serve as Nujoma's finance secretary.
   Opposition groups also have been in a conciliatory mood.
   Seven parties won seats in the elections, and they have sharp
ideological differences. But within weeks, the 72-member
constitutional assembly unanimously agreed on a democratic
constitution that guarantees fundamental rights and regular
elections. It also limits the president to two five-year terms,
rare on a continent where most leaders serve for life.
   SWAPO, which was committed to socialism while in exile, now
speaks more often of working with the white business community that
controls the mining, farming and fishing industries.
   Those industries, along with South African aid, have made
Namibia one of the few African countries to achieve an annual per
capita income of $1,000.
   However, the wealth is in the hands of the 75,000 whites, who
make up only 6 percent of the population.
   Meeting black expectations without alienating whites will be one
of the biggest challenges facing the government.
   There have been no signs of a mass exodus by whites, who easily
could go to white-ruled South Africa as thousands did when the
United Nations announced Namibia's independence plan in 1978.
   The U.N. plan sat on the shelf for a decade as South Africa
refused to relinquish control of the territory, which it captured
from Germany during World War I.
   But in December 1988, South Africa agreed to grant independence
to Namibia under a regional peace treaty.
   At the ceremony when the new Namibian constitution was adopted
in November, several speakers said South Africa should take
inspiration from Namibia's harmonious independence process.
   Many South Africans were relieved at the Western-style
democratic constitution adopted by a constituent assembly in
Namibia. But others said they would withhold judgment, since
neighboring Zimbabwe also began its black majority rule with a
democracy and British-inspired constitution. Zimbabwe President
Robert Mugabe is now in the process of turning the government into
a one-party state.
   The long-delayed independence plan in Namibia almost collapsed
the day it began _ last April 1.
   Hundreds of SWAPO guerrillas crossed into northern Namibia in
violation of the U.N. plan, igniting three weeks of fighting. More
than 300 guerrillas died, and 27 members of the South African-led
security forces were killed.
   Since peace was restored, there has been sporadic violence. In
September, Anton Lubowski, SWAPO's highest-ranking white member,
was assassinated.
   But there have been no wide-scale outbreaks of violence, and the
more than 6,000 U.N. civilian and military personnel in Namibia are
scheduled to leave in early April. That will end the $450 million
U.N. operation, the most extensive ever conducted by the United
Nations.

<TEXT>
   Blackouts have been on the increase lately in a
tough, rundown neighborhood on Havana's east side.
   And to some, that could be a political omen. With the blackout
of communism in Eastern Europe nearly complete, is Cuba next?
   For his part, President Fidel Castro is convinced that communism
is here to stay. He confidently asserts that those who think
otherwise have always underestimated Cuban resolve.
   But even stalwart admirers of the revolution admit the country
faces greater uncertainty than at any time in years. Cuba is
suffering from ideological and political isolation. The economy has
been in decline for years. There are doubts about Cuba's relations
with its chief benefector, the Soviet Union.
   Nonetheless, Castro is still able to claim the allegiance of
millions of his countrymen. His support level is substantial, at
least when compared with that of Eastern Europe's former
leadership. It passed into history last year seemingly unmourned by
its subjects.
   Still, most Cubans agree that backing for the revolution has
waned since the heady early days. Hardships abound here. Buying
food, getting to work or making a phone call can be major
undertakings. Everything is scarce, it seems, except grumbling.
   The number of Cubans fleeing for Miami on boats has been
averaging 40 a month, a sharp increase.
   But Castro, to many, remains the embodiment of Cuban
nationalism, the leader who brought justice and dignity to a
country that had little of either. Castro's mystique is such that
anyone who judges his support based on Cuba's economic indicators
is using the wrong approach.
   Many Cubans feel Castro has rescued them from certain oblivion.
Juan Aizpura Rodriguez was a 15-year-old grade school dropout with
little hope at the time of the 1959 revolution.
   He now boasts a college degree and a prestigious job as a member
of the national directorate of one of Cuba's mass organizations.
   ``If it weren't for the revolution, the masses would be
suffering,'' Aizpura says.
   And, as the Cuban media constantly point out, the socialist
regimes in Eastern Europe were tainted from the start, having been
imposed by Moscow after World War II. In contrast, the view here is
that the Cuban revolution is legitimate because it was home-grown.
   Castro's message these days is that those who look on the
revolution as a ``house of cards'' vulnerable to the slightest
breeze are dead wrong.
   There was some evidence to support that thesis last Tuesday
evening when about 50,000 students gathered in front of the
presidential palace to commemorate a revolutionary anniversary.
Attendance at such events is prudent in a country where people,
especially students, often are judged by their revolutionary zeal.
   But the enthusiasm written on the faces and heard in the
patriotic chants seemed genuine. Even after three decades, Castro
has not lost his ability to hypnotize audiences.
   Castro is not one to retreat in the face of adversity. Rather
than copy the reforms now common in Eastern Europe, Castro has
become more assertive than ever in his defense of socialism.
   For decades, he ended his speeches with: ``Fatherland or
death!'' Now there is a supplement: ``Socialism or death!''
   But Castro's speeches suggest a strong sense that the unexpected
may happen, that the government must be increasingly vigilant.
Human rights activists who once had some room to manuever now find
themselves the targets of mass protests. Most of the rest are
either in jail or intimidated.
   How many support the activists? How many would welcome a change
in the system? Given the closed nature of Cuban society, those
questions may be impossible to answer.
   The revolution's future may well be decided by forces beyond
Cuba's control.
   The Soviet Union has been an extraordinarily reliable patron for
Cuba for years, contributing an average of $5 billion annually in
economic help. A recent Izvestia article said Cuba's debt to the
Soviets was $24.7 billion.
   Add the estimated $7 billion owed to Western banks, and Cuba
emerges as one of the most heavily indebted countries per capita, a
nation whose ambitious social welfare program has been built
largely with borrowed money.
   If Soviet aid to Cuba is scaled down, as widely predicted, and
living standards decline, diplomats wonder whether Castro's
charisma will be enough to placate his countrymen.
   But Foreign Ministry officials say Soviet-Cuban relations are as
strong as ever, despite the revisionist policies of the Soviet
leader.
   Castro, though, is taking no chances, warning that extreme
belt-tightening measures may be required if Moscow is forced to cut
back.

<HEAD>Giant Tumor Removed From Woman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors have removed a 42-pound tumor
from a 25-year-old woman after a rare operation in New Delhi, news
reports said Saturday.
   The mass of tissues, the size of at least seven babies, was
removed from the right ovary of a Nepalese woman during a
three-hour operation Friday, New Delhi newspapers said.
   ``The operation was unique because of the giant size of the
tumor, the way it lay pressed against all the vital organs and the
complicated surgery that was needed,'' Dr. Deep Thakkar, one of the
10 doctors who performed the operation, was quoted as saying.
   The Times of India newspaper said the tumor was thrusting
against the chest, intestines, spleen, kidneys and liver, making it
difficult for the young woman to breathe, move, eat or drink.
   The tumor is 200 times the size and 500 times the weight of a
normal ovary, the newspaper quoted doctors as saying.
   Press Trust of India said the patient, Jayakala, who has only
one name, weighed 77 pounds after the operation. The operation was
conducted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the
country's most prestigious hospital.
   According to the Guinness Book of Records, the world's largest
tumor, weighing 328 pounds, was also an ovarian one and was removed
from a woman in Texas in 1905.

Saturday, police said.
   A police source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
patrolman Yoshihiro Nishimura, 26, was in serious condition at a
downtown hospital after the incident.
   He said the attacker, identified as Soichi Suzuki, 32, also
suffered an injury while scuffling with a second patrolman. He was
arrested and sent to a hospital.
   The reason for the stabbing was not clear. The police source
said Nishimura was about to question Suzuki, who was wandering
about the plaza, when he suddenly stabbed him. No further details
were immediately available.
   The plaza is outside the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo, where
Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko live.

<HEAD>Trial Date Set For Dictator's Brother</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The brother of deposed dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu will go on trial April 2 for murder in the
shooting of seven people during Romania's revolution, the
prosecutor's office said Saturday.
   Nicolae Andruta Ceausescu, a lieutenent-general in the dreaded
Securitate secret police, was in command of 1,000 police officers
in downtown Bucharest on Dec. 21, the eve of Ceausescu's overthrow.
   Prosecutor-General Lt. Gen. Gheorghe Robu said in a recent
newspaper interview that Nicolae Andruta shot demonstrators in
Palace Square after he could not persuade his own troops to open
fire. The square is in front of the former Communist Party
headquarters.
   Nicolae Andruta was a deputy interior minister and headed the
nation's primary Securitate school training members of the secret
police. The school is in Baneasa, north of the capital.
   Prosecutors also said the appeals of three of his henchmen will
be heard Monday. The announcement was carried on Bucharest radio.
   The three, Emil Bobu, Manea Manescu and Tudor Postelnicu, were
sentenced to life in prison Feb. 2 for complicity to genocide.
   Bobu, 62, former secretary of the Communist Party Central
Committee, was the third-ranking member of the Ceausescu hierarchy
after the dictator and his wife, Elena.
   Postelnicu, 59, is the former interior minister. Manescu, 74, is
the former vice president of the dictator's State Council. All
three were also senior Politburo members.
   Also sentenced to life at the February trial was another
Politburo member, Ion Dinca, 62. He declined to appeal after
sentencing last month, but Bucharest radio said Saturday his lawyer
had appealed for him. The radio report did not indicate when the
appeal would be heard.
   The conviction of the four was based primarily on their
agreement to follow the elder Ceausescu's orders and open fire on
demonstrators in the western city of Timisoara, where the
revolution began. They made the decision during a Dec. 17 Politburo
meeting, at which the dictator presided.
   Also awaiting trial are the dictator's son, Nicu, and daughter,
Zoia-Elena.
   Nicu, former party boss in the Transylvanian city of Sibiu, is
accused of ordering his forces to open fire on demonstrators during
the revolution. At least 90 protesters died.
   Zoia-Elena is not accused of any repression, but police
reportedly found $90,000 in cash and expensive jewelry at her home
in Bucharest.

<HEAD>Unexpected Diplomatic Gains From Quayle's South America Trip</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was supposed to be a trip mostly about
Panama, but when Vice President Dan Quayle came home from a week in
South America scarcely a word about Panama had been uttered.
   Instead the vice president found himself drawn into what one of
his aides dubbed a ``rolling summit'' on Nicaragua, as he and
regional leaders crisscrossed the continent to attend presidential
inaugurations in Chile and Brazil.
   ``Panama is behind us and now we are talking about the future,''
Quayle told reporters. He acknowledged he had expected to run into
heads of state still seething about President Bush's December
invasion that they saw as a violation of Panama's sovereignty.
   But the Latin leaders, he contended, have a ``new thinking'' of
pragmatism that doesn't let such matters get in the way of their
pressing agenda for peace and economic stability.
   Following the removal of U.S. invasion troops from Panama and
with an election pending on constitutional changes there, almost
all of the Latin countries have restored relations with the
U.S.-installed government, or are in the process of doing so.
   As Quayle arrived in South America, the region's leaders were
focusing on more pressing matters, including their own
inflation-ridden economies, and trying to get Nicaragua back on
peaceful footing under a new elected government.
   As it turned out, Quayle ended up being the first high-level
official of the Bush administration to break the U.S. freezeout
against Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega. Meeting with Quayle in
both Chile and Brazil, the Nicaraguan promised he would peacefully
transfer power to Violeta Chamorro in April.
   The Ortega encounter was not part of the plans when President
Bush sent Quayle to mend fences over Panama.
   ``It was a case of being in the right place at the right time,''
explained one administration official, saying the trip had been far
more substantive than anticipated.
   It raised Quayle's profile internationally and showed he was
capable of turning what could have been routine protocol
appearances into significant diplomacy.
   In fact President Bush invited Secretary of State James A. Baker
III and deputy national security adviser Robert Gates to join him
and Quayle for lunch Friday so Quayle could give a full accounting
of the trip.
   ``We think that prospects for a resolution of the imbroglio in
Nicaragua are better than they were a week ago'' at least in part
because of Quayle's discussions during his trip, Quayle's press
secretary, David Beckwith, said.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, who was part of the U.S. delegation to the
Chilean inaugural, wrote a letter to Bush thanking him for naming
the Massachusetts Democrat to the delegation and adding that Quayle
``performed extremely well as head of our delegation and was a
great credit to our country and your administration.''
   Kennedy told a reporter during the trip that Quayle was
knowledgeable and held his own in discussions with important
regional leaders.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``Our assessment is
that (the trip) was quite successful. For one thing, the vice
president was met with broad acceptance and cheers throughout the
hemisphere. ... It demonstrated a high degree of support for the
United States and some very good feelings toward the United States
in Latin America.''
   After four trips to the region since becoming vice president,
Quayle places great stock in being on a first-name basis with
almost all the presidents in the region. He feels he has a firm
grasp of the issues of importance in a region that historically has
often felt slighted by the United States.
   Officials traveling with Quayle said he was able to interject
the U.S. point of view that not only must the Nicaraguan Contras be
demobilized but that demands also must be placed on Ortega's
Sandinista government.
   Quayle's involvement came as the Latins themselves continued
moving to shape their own political landscape.
   They got the rolling summit going when Felipe Gonzales brought
his plane to Venezuela to ferry a group to Chile's inauguration of
Patricio Aylwin last Sunday.
   The passengers included presidents President Carlos Andres Perez
of Venezuela, Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, Rafael Callejas of
Honduras, and Ortega.
   The powerful assemblage of regional leaders was an example of
the dramatic and casual diplomacy that was ubiquitous both in Chile
and Brazil.
   In Santiago's Hotel Carrera, Arias walked down the lobby stairs
from a meeting with Quayle, as Spain's Gonzalez walked in. They
embraced and cameras whirred.
   ``Mensaje recibido,'' Gonzalez told Arias. Message received.
   Nobody else knew what the exchange meant, but the moment seemed
to underscore the behind-the-scenes work by the leaders trying to
get the Contra rebels demobilized and achieve a peaceful transition
of government in Nicaragua.
   At Fernando Collor de Mello's inauguration in Brasilia, the
Latin presidents huddled on the floor of the National Congress in
conversations that moved back and forth between groups of two and
three and five.
   Arias, who won a Nobel prize for spearheading the Nicaragua
peace plan that led to elections last month, chatted at length with
Perez, one of the most dominant leaders of the region.
   Ortega arrived and stayed by Arias' side as they greeted others
flowing to and from their group.
   Among those who stopped by: Cuba's Fidel Castro.

<HEAD>Matisse Drawings on Display First Time in U.S.-Soviet Show</HEAD>

   Yellowed drawings from Henri Matisse's
sketchbook in Morocco, many of them unknown to art scholars for
nearly 80 years, will be displayed publicly for the first time
Sunday at the National Gallery of Art.
   The exhibition of paintings and drawings by the French
post-impressionist during two visits to Morocco also represents a
breakthrough in U.S.-Soviet cultural collaboration, says gallery
director J. Carter Brown.
   It is the first exhibition mounted jointly by U.S. and Soviet
curators from beginning to end, he said, with contributions from
the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow and the Hermitage Museum
in Leningrad.
   The show contains 23 Matisse paintings, more than half never
exhibited in the United States, and 47 drawings whose existence was
largely unknown until their discovery during a three-year search of
private collections scattered throughout Europe.
   Matisse spent several months in 1912 and 1913 exploring the
exotic streets and cafes of Tangier in search of new artistic
themes. Many of his 25 Moroccan paintings were quickly purchased by
Moscow art collectors Ivan Morosov and Sergei Shchukin, and wound
up in Soviet museums.
   His drawings were dispersed among family members, friends and
private collectors in Europe and forgotten.
   Jack Cowart, curator of 20th century art at the National
Gallery, said his curatorial team's ``voyage of discovery''
uncovered a bonanza of 67 Matisse drawings from Morocco.
   One of the sketches, a view of Tangier from the window of
Matisse's hotel, joined the exhibition Monday night after a flight
from France.
   Its existence was confirmed in a telephone call to Matisse
scholar Pierre Schneider by the granddaughter of the former
proprietor of the Hotel Villa de France, where Matisse stayed in
Tangier.
   In all, the curators uncovered a bonanza of 67 Matisse drawings
from Morocco. Of the 47 being displayed at the gallery, all but
three have never been exhibited before. Cowart refuses to say where
the newly discovered drawings were found.
   All of Matisse's paintings from that pivotal period in his
artistic career are in the show except for two. One is extremely
fragile and cannot leave the Hermitage Museum. The other is held by
the Barnes Foundation near Philadelphia under terms that forbid its
public display.
   Brown said the exhibition represents ``not only one of the most
dazzling moments in 20th century art but also new chapters in the
study of Matisse's art and in the cooperation of museums and
scholars of east and west.''
   Cowart said Soviet art officials had expressed interest in late
1987 in collaborating on a joint exhibition, instead of merely
agreeing on an even swap of pictures.
   Over lunch at the National Gallery a few months later, Cowart
said, the Soviet ministry of culture officially expressed interest
and Brown ``turned over the Matisse-Morocco card.''
   ``They instantly said yes, right, let's get on with it,'' Cowart
said, and the joint venture was sealed.
   The exhibition will run at the National Gallery through June 3.
It will appear at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, which
helped organize the show, from June 24 through Sept. 4. It will
travel to Moscow for an appearance at the Pushkin Museum from Sept.
28 through Nov. 20, and to the Hermitage from Dec. 15 through Feb.
15, 1991.

<HEAD>New Rates So High Some Argentines May Have to Give Up Phones</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN FERNANDEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even inflation-hardened
Argentines were stunned by phone bills arriving last week that were
as much as 17 times higher than the last ones.
   Antonio Lecce paid $3.60 last month and expects to get a $40
bill this month. That's about half a month's pay for the hundreds
of thousands of public employees in Argentina, where one of every
five adults lacks a full-time job.
   ``I just won't pay it,'' said Lecce, 50. ``It's better to have
them take the phone away than to sell the house to pay the phone
bill.''
   A group representing thousands of small businesses said Friday
its members received ``unjust ... and unpayable'' bills that are as
much as 2,000 percent higher than the last ones. It asked President
Carlos Menem to intervene.
   Rates went up March 9 by what the state telephone company Entel
said was an average 433 percent.
   Bills, however, contain much higher rates. The latest bimonthly
service charge plus 200 calls, for example, increased by 1,682
percent, to 31,816 australs ($6.75) from the previous 1,785
australs.
   A typical family's bill jumped nearly 10-fold to $43.80 _
prohibitively high for most.
   ``There is no relation between what they charge us and what we
earn,'' said Jorge Milovich, 52.
   The government's explanation is that rates were eroded by
inflation, which skyrocketed by 12,000 percent in the past year.
The increase in January alone was 79 percent, and 62 percent last
month.
   Also, rates had to be increased to allow a profit at a
deficit-ridden company the government is trying desperately to sell.
   People who can't afford the new rates may have to share
telephones, company director Maria Julia Alsogaray said.
   The increases _ and Alsogaray's comments _ outraged Argentines
who live with substandard phone service to begin with. Their phones
go dead when it rains, and even on the sunniest days it is
difficult to get dial tone or get the right connection on the first
try.
   ``We now have telephones with international prices, but we don't
have international-quality service,'' Fernando Bravo of Radio
Rivadavia told listeners.
   Cynical Argentines allege the increase will force people to
default on their payments, thus allowing Entel to take over lines
and resell them to people who have been unable to get lines because
of a shortage.
   Lines commonly are stolen and sold on a black market. Illegal
telephone wires flap from dozens of downtown office buildings and
apartments.
   While the increased revenue may balance accounts, it also may
fuel public opposition to a controversial plan to sell Entel.
   Critics claim it represents a loss of national sovereignty and
that Entel is virtually being given away to private interests.
   Alsogaray told Congress last week that the company, which
administers 3 million lines thoughout this nation of 32 million, is
valued at $1.7 billion. Sixty percent is being offered to investors
for $1 billion in cash and debt-equity swaps.
   Rodolfo Terragno, the public works minister for the previous
government, said he thought the sale would go through because the
Peronist Party controls the presidency and Congress. The former
government tried to sell Entel in 1988 but was barred by Congress.
   Argentines may not be happy if the sale is made.
   ``I think service will get better, but fewer people will have
phones,'' Terragno said.
   Roberto Jiminez, like thousands of Argentines, waited years to
get a phone line. ``Now it looks like I'll have to give it up,'' he
said.

   The legislators who most closely oversee
America's defense budget reaped $2 million in campaign
contributions last year from political action committees affiliated
with the defense industry.
   The biggest chunks went to committee leaders and other
legislators who are particularly influential on military matters,
according to an Associated Press analysis of campaign receipts by
members of four key congressional panels.
   The committees will play a major role in determining how the
pro-democracy movement in Eastern Europe and improved relations
with the Soviet Union are translated into Pentagon budget cuts that
could have a big impact on defense contractors.
   Ninety-two of the 104 legislators who serve on the four panels
got money from defense PACs, with the largest share going to Sen.
J. Bennett Johnson, a Louisiana Democrat who sits on the Senate
Appropriations defense subcommittee.
   Johnston received $128,000 from defense PACs whose sponsors read
like a who's who of military contractors.
   The AP analysis covered PAC contributions to members of the
defense subcommittees of the House and Senate appropriations
committees, and to members of each chamber's Armed Services panel.
   In good times and bad, it is common practice for special
interests to target their PAC contributions to legislators with
influence in their fields.
   Banking-related PACs, for example, gave nearly $6 million in the
1987-88 election cycle to legislators on committees with
jurisdiction over banking issues, according to the newsletter PACs
&amp; Lobbies.
   Congress for years has been debating campaign finance reforms
that would limit the role of PACs in congressional races. Yet many
lawmakers and PAC officials reject the contention of public
interest groups that special-interest money unduly influences
congressional votes.
   A spokesman for Johnston, Tony Garrett, said ``It makes sense
that people in the defense industry would support those who favor a
strong national defense and who are key players in defense policy.
They also know the senator through his efforts to bring more
defense industries to Louisiana.''
   A prominent player in the campaign finance deliberations, Rep.
Beryl Anthony, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, said there is nothing wrong with accepting PAC money but
that the soaring costs of campaigns have perhaps created the
perception that lawmakers are too reliant on special interest money.
   ``Taking a legal PAC contribution is not sleazy,'' Anthony said
in an interview Friday. ``The culprit is in how much money it takes
to run an election.''
   The 1989 PAC contributions, detailed in year-end campaign
finance reports to the Federal Election Commission, cover the first
half of the 1989-90 election cycle. Fund-raising generally
escalates during election years, and past donors are among the
first targets to be tapped.
   On top of PAC contributions, additional money from defense
contractors is channeled to lawmakers as honoraria for speeches and
other appearances. In 1987, for example, members of the four
defense-related committees received $521,000 in honoraria from the
top 50 defense contractors, according to the Common Cause advocacy
group.
   Legislators also receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in
contributions from labor union PACs whose members work at defense
plants and from PACs for lobbying firms whose clients include major
defense contractors. The $2 million figure, however, covers only
donations from PACs affiliated with defense contractors.
   PACs affiliated with companies that would be most affected by
major reductions in defense spending were among the biggest
financial backers of members of the four congressional panels.
   General Motors Corp.'s PACs, for example, distributed nearly
$140,000 last year among 75 members of the four defense-related
committees, according to the AP analysis. GM's donations included
those from its corporate PAC and from the PACs of its Electronic
Data Systems and Hughes Aircraft subsidiaries.
   Not far behind was McDonnell Douglas Corp., whose two PACs gave
$132,000 to 73 members of the congressional panels. Next were
Textron Inc. and Lockheed Corp., whose PACs each made $103,000 in
1989 contributions to members of the four committees.
   Coming in just short of $100,000 in total donations to the
committee members were the PACs associated with Grumman Corp.,
Northrop Corp. and Raytheon Co. Raytheon's totals include donations
by the PAC of its Beech Aircraft subsidiary.
   PACs for Martin Marietta Corp., Rockwell International Corp.,
United Technologies Corp., Boeing Co., General Dynamics Corp., LTV
Corp. and Westinghouse Electric Corp. contributed between $50,000
and $90,000 each to members of the defense-related congressional
panels.
   While the chairmen and ranking Republicans of the congressional
committees generally were among the biggest recipients of
defense-industry PAC money, there was one major exception last year.
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate defense
appropriations panel, received just $1,000 in defense-industry PAC
money; $2,150 in total PAC donations. Inouye, who is not up for
re-election until 1992, received $52,000 in defense PAC money
during the 1985-86 election cycle.
   The ranking Republican on that same panel, Alaska Sen. Ted
Stevens, reported defense-industry PAC contributions of $112,500 in
1989 and total PAC contributions of $497,000. He is heavily favored
for re-election this year.
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Democrat
Sam Nunn of Georgia, received more than $489,000 from PACs in 1989,
of which $88,000 came from the defense industry. The panel's
ranking Republican, John Warner of Virginia, received $395,000 from
PACs, $86,000 of it from the defense industry.
   Other big recipients of defense PAC money included:
   _Rep. John P. Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the House defense
appropriations subcommittee. He received $150,000 from PACs last
year, $55,500 of it from the defense industry.
   _Rep. Joseph M. McDade of Pennsylvania, ranking Republican on
the same panel. He raised $79,000 from PACs, $36,000 of it from the
defense industry. McDade, who is under FBI investigation for his
relationship with a now-defunct defense contractor, used all of his
1989 campaign contributions to pay legal fees.
   _Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee. Aspin received $135,000 from PACs last year, of which
$41,000 came from the defense industry.
   _Rep. William L. Dickinson of Alabama, senior Republican on the
Armed Services Committee. Dickinson received $52,000 last year from
defense-industry PACs, representing 71 percent of his $72,000 in
total PAC receipts.

<TEXT>
   A dispute over Hindu plans to expand a
cremation site resulted in a clash between Hindus and Moslems on
Saturday that left two people dead and at least 25 wounded, police
and news reports said.
   The trouble began when residents of a predominantly Moslem
neighborhood in New Delhi objected to a group of Hindus trying to
extend the boundary of their cremation ground, said a police
spokesman.
   Unlike Hindus, who burn corpses, Moslems bury their dead.
   The arguments turned into a clash, which police broke up. But
minutes later, a mob began hurling stones at officers, who opened
fire.
   United News of India said an 11-year-old Moslem boy and an
unidentified person were killed. The boy had bullet injuries on the
neck.
   Sectarian clashes periodically erupt in India, where Hindus make
up 82 percent of the population. Moslems comprise 12 percent.
   At least 400 people were killed in Hindu-Moslem riots in India
in 1989.

   Striking teachers in two counties have
voted to return to work Monday, marking the first defections in the
11-day-old teachers strike.
   Teachers in the largely rural Jackson and Greenbrier counties
voted Friday to end their walkout after being warned they could
lose their jobs if they remained on strike. Both county school
boards promised not to punish striking teachers if they return
Monday.
   Also Friday, the state Supreme Court upheld a lower court's
order that striking teachers in one county return to work, but it
later overrode another judge's attempt to issue a statewide
back-to-work order.
   Senate President Keith Burdette and House of Delegates Speaker
Chuck Chambers scheduled informal talks by telephone and planned to
talk later today with the West Virginia Education Association and
the West Virginia Federation of Teachers.
   ``Chuck and I haven't agreed yet on what has to be done,''
Burdette said. ``All we're trying to determine is if we can offer
something rational to all the parties involved.''
   WVEA spokeswoman Jackie Goodwin said the discussions since
midweek have been positive but that it's too early to say that the
strike is nearing an end.
   ``If a genuine solution is reached, that will be seen,'' Goodwin
said. ``At this point, we don't have anything in concrete and the
strike continues.''
   Talks between the legislative leaders and the teachers began
when Gov. Gaston Caperton said he would no longer negotiate with
teachers after they rejected his third offer for ending the walkout.
   Burdette said he and Chambers met with union representatives
Thursday and Friday but reached no agreement.
   The strike has prompted a series of court hearings around the
state in school officials' attempt to get teachers to return to
work. The latest resulted in the state Supreme Court on Friday
overriding a Kanawha County circuit judge's statewide back-to-work
order.
   The series of court rulings began Friday morning when the state
Supreme Court, ruling in a Jefferson County case, upheld the right
of circuit judges to order teachers back to work on a
county-by-county basis. Ohio and Berkeley county court judges also
have issued back-to-work orders.
   Acting on the high court's ruling, Attorney General Roger
Tompkins sought a statewide injunction Friday afternoon from
Kanawha County Circuit Judge John Hey.
   ``I think the (attorney general) has sustained the burden
necessary to demonstrate that irreparable harm exists and will
continue to exist as long as those children are out of school,''
Hey said in making his ruling. ``How can anyone sit there with a
straight face and say there's not irreparable harm?''
   As Hey ruled, the two teachers' unions were asking the state
Supreme Court to block his action, contending the state must seek
injunctions in each of the 55 counties.
   The high court voted 4-0 to stay Hey's ruling and set a hearing
on the case for Tuesday.
   State School Superintendent Hank Marockie said earlier Friday
that teachers, who began striking March 7, will be notified by
letter of potential disciplinary action if they refuse to return to
work.
   Strike activity was reported in 47 counties on Wednesday, when
Marockie ordered schools closed for two days to ease tensions. At
that time, only about one-third of the state's nearly 22,000
teachers showed up for work, the Department of Education said.
   The state's teachers earn an average $21,904 a year, according
to the National Education Association, less than teachers in every
state except Arkansas and South Dakota.
   Caperton has said the only way he can provide teacher pay raises
is to raise taxes, which he said the public opposes. The teachers
received a 5 percent pay raise earlier this year along with other
public employees.

<TEXT>
   On the assembly line at Textron Lycoming
where technicians worry over stout tank engines, terms like ``peace
dividend'' and ``defense budget cuts'' take on ominous and concrete
meaning.
   This sprawling plant made Corsair fighters during World War II,
helicopter engines for the Vietnam War and M-1 tank engines during
the Reagan-era defense build-up.
   Now the company faces a slowdown as sudden as any that could be
brought on by a surrender or a peace treaty.
   ``The Army planned to buy close to 600 tanks a year,'' said G.
Russell Zink, a vice president at Textron Lycoming. ``Now they plan
to buy zero.''
   ``The Army was required to come in with cuts _ massive cuts.
Where they took a cut, it was a meat-axe approach,'' Zink said.
   While not alone in facing defense cuts, Connecticut, on a per
capita basis, is one of the largest if not the largest military
contracting state.
   Overall, Connecticut ranked ninth in the nation in 1988 _ the
most recent year for which statistics are available _ with $4.9
billion in military contracts. California was by far the largest
with $23 billion in contracts. But Connecticut was ahead of such
states as New Jersey, Washington and Arizona.
   State officials, military contractors and industry analysts have
been expecting Connecticut to face severe cutbacks. What has been
surprising is how quickly the indicators of lean times have
surfaced.
   _ Textron is faced with laying off some 1,350 workers, a third
of its workforce in Stratford, Conn., unless the Pentagon can be
persuaded to produce at least some M-1 tanks over the next few
years.
   _ Sikorsky Aircraft, just up Main Street from Textron, laid off
300 white-collar workers last month. U.S. military contracts for
its helicopters have declined from 165 in 1987 to 120 this year.
The company has been expanding its civilian helicopter business and
is even talking about making light rail cars.
   _ UNC Inc. announced last week it would phase out its
Uncasville, Conn., Naval Products Division, one of only two
facilities in the country for building nuclear submarine engines.
The move will eventually displace 950 workers. Bruce Andrews, who
heads the UNC division, called the decision ``the inevitable
consequence of reduced defense spending.''
   Textron has enlisted the Connecticut congressional delegation to
lobby for a softening of the Bush administration's no-new-tanks
position. Rep. John Rowland, R-Conn., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, said Army Secretary Michael Stone was
``cautiously optimistic'' in a recent meeting that a minimal level
of tank production can be maintained.
   The Army is working on a on a new heavy tank, but production is
several years away. In the meantime, with troop reductions on the
way in Western Europe, the Army decided it could do without any
more M-1s after current production contracts expire.
   Textron, which has been making about 1,000 engines per year,
would be able to make up only a fraction of that loss by boosting
foreign sales.
   The M-1 program, like other major defense contracts, is spread
around among several states, a strategy that some critics have said
hinders efficiency while strengthening political support for costly
weapons systems.
   Major parts and assembly plants are located in Michigan, Ohio
and Pennsylvania. Suppliers for the 1,500 horsepower gas turbine
engine alone are spread among 32 states.
   Members from some of those states are expected to grill top Army
officials at an Armed Services hearing this week. But just as many
members appear to be pushing for greater reductions in defense
spending to free up money for deficit reduction or domestic
programs.
   The government has more at stake at Textron Lycoming than at
other defense industries around the country. Over the past five
yeras the Army and Textron spent more than $120 million to
modernize the plant for high-speed production and to meet wartime
requirements.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., is preparing
legislation that would help defense industries nationwide convert
to civilian production. One uncertainty about the bill is whether
it will receive the Bush administration's backing.
   ``The president's proposal for the peace dividend is to help
other countries,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., whose district
includes the UNC plant. ``Well, I'm all for helping others, but
there ought to be a peace dividend for Americans.''
   Defense analysts and industry executives are uncertain about
whether converting some defense industries to civilian pursuits is
a realistic option.
   ``Where does Norden Systems build radars for non-defense
industries? What does (General Dynamics) Electric Boat do about
non-defense submarines?'' said Ron Hertsenstein, research director
at Forecast International in Newtown, Conn., a defense industry
consulting firm.
   Gejdenson rejects that thinking.
   ``The only other choice,'' he said, ``is just walking away from
it all _ and that's not acceptable.''

   Government officials have begun final work on a
package of reforms aimed at restructuring the economy and diffusing
trade friction with the United States, a government spokesman said
Saturday.
   The measures were presented to leaders of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party on Friday night, said an official from the prime
minister's office. He said details of the plan could not be
disclosed because it is under negotiation with Washington.
   The Asahi Shimbun, a major Japanese newspaper, said the contents
of the draft are ``far away from the concrete improvements demanded
by the U.S. side, and negotiations with the United States will
surely face difficulties.''
   But other media reports said the draft addresses U.S. concerns
about a law that protects small Japanese businesses by making it
very difficult to set up large retail stores.
   The United States has demanded the law be changed to allow more
big stores, because they generally carry more imported goods.
   Currently, it can take up to 10 years to get permission to open
a large store here, but the proposal would reduce that to one year,
according to the reports.
   It also would revise and tighten an anti-trust law on illegal
cartels, increasing fines from the current average of 1.5 percent
on profits, according to a government source.
   The issues have been discussed at ongoing talks between U.S. and
Japanese trade officials aimed at reducing Japan's huge trade
surplus. A progress report on those talks is due in mid-April.
   Regarding the law on large stores, a trade ministry official
said, ``Our basic policy on the law is to implement it in an
appropriate manner, not to abolish it.''
   An official of the Liberal Democratic Party said most of the
party supports this view but added that ``there would be a strong
opposing argument in the party toward revising and eliminating the
retail law.'' He said a working-level delegation will be sent to
the United States on Monday.
   Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity.

   Mayor Marion Barry is refusing to write
himself out of the political script for the nation's capital even
as he fights cocaine and perjury charges and confronts his personal
addictions.
   ``I'm back. I feel good about myself,'' Barry declared as he
returned to the district last week after seven weeks of substance
abuse treatment in Florida and South Carolina.
   In speeches and interviews since his return, the mayor has tried
to portray himself as a man rededicated to his job and waging a
courageous battle against alcoholism and addiction to tranquilizers.
   He also says he'll triumph over his legal problems.
   ``He is the walking definition of chutzpah, and the main reason
for that is that his entire life he has been doing things people
have told him he cannot do,'' said local political commentator Mark
Plotkin.
   Barry vowed to complete his term in office and left open the
possibility of seeking re-election in November.
   ``Whether I run or don't run I am not going to sit on the
sidelines and let the city just go without any advice from me,'' he
said in one interview.
   Barry, charged with cocaine possession after an FBI ``sting''
operation at a Washington hotel in January, openly admits to a
``chemical dependency'' on alcohol and tranquilizers but has
skirted questions about cocaine.
   The mayor is scheduled for trial June 4 on five misdemeanor
charges of cocaine possession and three counts of lying to a grand
jury about his drug involvement. Conviction on any of the perjury
charges would permanently bar him from holding office, but Barry
insists he will beat the charges in court.
   Barry's legal and political troubles have left other mayoral
hopefuls scrambling to siphon off his supporters, but the man who
has directed the local political scene for more than a decade shows
no signs of relinquishing power.
   ``The mayor is clearly enjoying himself, and is taking pleasure
at sharing the personal, human side of this,'' said one Barry
campaign aide who requested anonymity.
   ``He's revved up, and we've received a lot of support,'' the
aide said. ``We're trying to assess whether the personal support
will translate into political support, but we're optimistic.''
   Mayoral hopeful Walter Fauntroy, currently the district's
Democratic non-voting delegate to Congress, cut short a trip to
Israel and hurried back to Washington after he got word of Barry's
early return.
   An aide described Fauntroy as ``extremely nervous'' about
Barry's political plans.
   In a 30-minute public address upon his return, Barry repeatedly
insisted that he has learned from his mistakes and turned the
corner on what he described as his alcohol problem.
   The mayor lashed out at the media and portrayed himself as the
victim of unwarranted personal attacks and self-imposed job
pressures.
   At one point, he was interrupted by chants of ``four more
years'' from city workers and supporters who crowded into the
municipal building to hear his speech.
   When Barry promised to announce his political plans ``in the
very near future,'' the crowd cheered even louder.
   Public opinion polls show that Barry still enjoys the support of
between 20 percent and 25 percent of the voters, which might be
enough to put him on top in a crowded Democratic primary field that
already includes five candidates.
   ``If all those candidates are in the race come primary day,
anything's possible,'' Plotkin said. ``Barry simply cannot be
dismissed.''
   Barry is reading the polls too.
   ``I have been encouraged and really elated by the hard-core
support I have had in this town,'' he said. ``Now that all of this
has happened, even our own polls show 32 percent'' support Barry.
   Some political observers said Barry's homecoming speech was
directed as much toward the prospective jurors for his upcoming
trial as toward the voters.
   ``With this performance, he's running for acquittal as much as
running for office,'' Plotkin said.

<TEXT>
   Relief workers and several governments
fear that an ambitious U.N. program to help returning Afghan
refugees is premature because refugees are not returning to a
country still in the throes of war.
   Sadruddin Aga Khan, coordinator of the U.N. refugee repatriation
program, recently appealed for more money to ease what he called
the suffering of hundreds of thousands of Afghan people. He chided
governments for failing to meet this year's $650 million target.
   Japan froze a $43 million contribution to Sadruddin's
``Operation Salam,'' saying money was being wasted on programs for
refugees who aren't returning to their homeland.
   Several aid workers in this rugged border city have echoed
Japan's fears, saying most of the 3.8 million refugees living in
Pakistan aren't going home because they say the war is not over.
   Another 2 million refugees living in Iran also are refusing to
return home.
   ``Everything depends on what happens on the political side,''
said a U.S. diplomat, referring to a negotiated end to the brutal,
11-year war that has reportedly left 1.5 million dead.
   ``The primary reason refugees won't leave is still security,''
she said on condition of anonymity.
   Almost two years ago, Sadruddin made an impassioned plea for
donations, conjuring up visions of hundreds of thousands of
refugees swarming back to Afghanistan. He asked for $1.2 billion.
   But last year, fewer than 100,000 refugees left Pakistan's
squalid camps, where open sewers snake through a maze of mud huts
and tents, to return to Afghanistan.
   ``And 100,000 is nothing when you have almost 4 million,'' said
the U.S. diplomat.
   ``Most of them say they will go when there is peace and
security,'' said Pierce Gerety, deputy chief of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees mission in Islamabad.
   ``They are afraid of the bombings, but they are also afraid of
the complete lack of law and order in mujahedeen-controlled
areas,'' he said.
   ``The country is crawling with angry armed males,'' said a
second U.N. official who refused identification. His headquarters
is in Peshawar and several times he has slipped across Pakistan's
border to Afghanistan.
   U.S.-backed Moslem insurgents have been fighting successive
Communist-backed governments in Kabul since a 1978 coup toppled
Mohammad Daoud, a cousin of Afghanistan's ex-monarch. They call
themselves mujahedeen, meaning Islamic ``holy warriors,'' because
they believe they are battling to safeguard Islam against an
atheist government.
   Several aid organizations headquartered in Pakistan, and even
the U.N. High Commissioenr, say Sadruddin set his sights too high
asking for $1.2 billion to repatriate refugees.
   Japan sent a team to study Sadruddin's programs in January.
Fujio Samukawa, first secretary at Japan's embassy in Islamabad,
said Japan fears some Japanese-funded programs are not being
monitored adequately and that money is being wasted.
   ``Donors have gradually become very skeptical about the
likelihood of repatriation,'' said a U.N. official, who asked not
to be identified. ``It was a bit of a false start.''

   Lou Diamond Phillips was thrown and
dragged by a horse during filming of ``Young Guns 2,'' and suffered
a broken arm that required 2{ hours of surgery, his publicist said.
   The Philippine-born actor, best known for his roles as singer
Ritchie Valens in ``La Bamba'' and as a defiant math student in
``Stand and Deliver,'' took the fall Friday evening when a noise
startled the horse, said publicist Eddie Michaels.
   Phillips, 28, was dragged across the former set of
``Silverado,'' which is being used in the ``Young Guns II'' sequel,
Michaels said.
   Phillips was airlifted to the University of New Mexico Hospital
in Albuquerque, where he underwent 2{ hours of surgery, Michaels
said. In addition to his broken arm, he suffered a gash on his knee.
   ``He was hurting a little bit but everything was real good as
far as his emotional state,'' Michaels said.
   The film is near the end of production and scenes that don't
require Phillips will be shot first, Michaels said.
   ``He won't be able to do anything for a while, but they'll do
everything they can around him at this point,'' he said.
   Cerrillos, a hamlet about 10 miles west of Galisteo, has been
transformed to represent old Lincoln, N.M., the scene of the bloody
Lincoln County War where Billy the Kid gained notoriety in the late
19th century.
   The ``Young Guns'' movies are based on the Billy the Kid story.
Phillips plays a half-Indian friend of Billy the Kid, played by
Emilio Estevez.
   Galisteo is about 20 miles south of Santa Fe.

counts of possession. Each count carries a maximum penalty of four
years in prison.
   Authorities said 25 balloons of heroin and cocaine were found in
his car during a March 9 traffic stop. He was released on $5,000
bail the next day.
   ``Corey wants to tell everyone who has been nice enough to wire
and call to keep the faith in him and in God and to stay away from
drugs in any way,'' his publicist, Michael Levine, said in a
statement Friday.
   Feldman has appeared in such films as ``Stand by Me,'' ``The
Goonies,'' ``Dream A Little Dream'' and ``The 'Burbs.''

   Jeff Conaway, who played the role of an
aspiring actor on the TV series ``Taxi,'' has been charged with
felony drunken driving after his car allegedly sideswiped and
injured a bicyclist.
   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office charged
Conaway on Friday with two counts of drunken driving and a
misdemeanor charge of giving false information to a police officer,
said deputy district attorney Allan S. Tyson.
   Prosecutors allege Conaway, 39, was speeding on a city street
when his sports car sideswiped bicyclist Farid Farhan, 31. Farhan
suffered a broken leg and a head wound needing 15 stitches in the
Feb. 23 accident.
   Tests indicated Conaway had a blood alcohol content of .15, or
nearly twice the state legal limit of .08, authorities said.
   Conaway was released on $2,500 bail, and is to be arraigned
April 5.
   He portrayed Bobby Wheeler, a frustrated actor waiting for his
big break. He left ``Taxi'' in 1981, about a year before the show
was canceled. Conaway also co-starred in the 1978 movie ``Grease''
with John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.

   Country singer Rose Maddox is staging a
concert April 1 to benefit her granddaughter, who fell into a coma
after being knocked down by a car last month but recently regained
consciousness.
   Maddox said she will perform with her band, Foggy Notion, and
three other groups at a benefit in nearby Medford to cover medical
expenses for 15-year-old Kelli Lynn Hale, whose family has no
medical insurance. The girl was struck by a car when she ran across
the street while looking for her cat.
   Maddox's career has spanned more than a half-century and earned
her induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville,
Tenn.
   The girl is making a steady recovery at a Medford hospital, said
Maddox.

   Jaime Escalante, the high school math teacher
whose career was profiled in the movie ``Stand and Deliver,'' says
he has changed his mind about leaving Garfield High School.
   The 59-year-old calculus instructor decided to remain for
another two years after receiving more than 500 letters and
telephone calls from former students and supporters.
   ``Everything is cool now,'' he said Friday. ``For the time
being, I will stay here. This is where I belong and the kids
appreciate what I do.''
   Escalante has taught at Los Angeles schools for 16 years. Last
month, he said he would resign because of frustration with parents
who in his view do not value academic achievement and a lack of
administrative support.
   One reason he is staying is the National Science Foundation
program he supervises at East Los Angeles College, he said. The
program teaches accelerated mathematics, science and English, and
trains teachers in Escalante's own methods.
   ``If I left the (high) school, I would lose my recruitment
network,'' Escalante said.
   Escalante said he had received several job offers over the past
three weeks, including unspecified opportunities in education
offered by President Bush and Gov. George Deukmejian.
   He received widespread attention in 1982 when all 18 of his
calculus students at an inner-city school passed national advanced
placement exams for college credit, and test administrators
challenged the results. Twelve students took the test a second time
and passed. The episode was portrayed in ``Stand and Deliver,''
starring Edward James Olmos as Escalante.

   Here are thumbnail sketches of the top
candidates of major parties competing in Sunday's East German
parliamentary elections.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PARTY OF DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM (former Communists)
   Hans Modrow, top candidate of the Communist Party, is the most
popular politician in East Germany despite his political
affiliation.
   The reform-minded head of the Communist caretaker government
backs an eventual ``united fatherland,'' but warns that East
Germany must not be swallowed by the West.
   Modrow, 62, agreed reluctantly to head the campaign of the
Communists, now calling themselves the Party of Democratic
Socialism.
   Party membership has plummeted from 2.5 million members less
than a year ago to about 650,000.
   Party activists hope Modrow's candidacy will boost voter support
from 5 percent to slightly over 10 percent.
   Modrow worked as locksmith before joining the Communist Party in
1949, the year Moscow carved East Germany out of Soviet-occupied
territory.
   He attended party-run universities in Moscow and Berlin before
earning a doctorate in economics. He rose quickly in the ranks,
joining the decision-making Central Committee in 1967.
   As party chief in Dresden from 1973 to 1989, he became
increasingly critical of the party hierarchy. During the fall
uprising, Modrow was among the first party leaders to seek a
dialogue with pro-democracy groups.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
   Ibrahim Boehme, top candidate of the front-runner Social
Democrats, is considered a favorite for the post of prime minister
in East Germany's new government.
   He has won personal popularity mainly because of his early
leadership in the fight against the old guard.
   Boehme was born in November 1944 near Leipzig, but his exact
birthdate is unknown because of confusion during World War II. His
mother and father died within two years of his birth, and Boehme
was raised in orphanages and foster homes.
   He completed high school in night school, then worked as a
teacher and in odd jobs.
   In the mid-1960s, he was temporarily forced to break off
university studies and stop teaching because of his support for
dissident philosopher Robert Havemann.
   He was allowed to resume studies of history and economics after
joining the Communist Party.
   Boehme quit the party in 1976 after numerous disagreements,
becoming an active member of an illegal Social Democratic
discussion group.
   After the Social Democrats were newly founded as party, he was
overwhelmingly elected chairman in February.
   The party, which claims about 100,000 members, wants a united
Germany to be a federation of states, based on the example of West
Germany. They want a market economy, and strong emphasis on
environmental and social concerns.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION
   Lothar de Maiziere, top candidate of the Christian Democratic
Union that used to be closely aligned with the Communists, has
tried to deal openly with his party's past.
   De Maiziere, who became party chief after last fall's popular
revolt, has acknowledged that the Christian Democrats were financed
by the Communists in exchange for support in East Germany's puppet
Parliament. Some CDU leaders stole party funds, he added.
   De Maiziere, 50, for many years headed the Lutheran Church
Council. After the revolt, he became deputy prime minister in the
Communist-led caretaker government.
   De Maiziere, a viola player, belongs to a prominent Huguenot
family with strong ties to West Germany. His uncle, Ulrich, held a
top post in the West German army, and his cousin Thomas is CDU
spokesman in West Berlin.
   The Christian Democrats, who claim about 140,000 members, want a
rapid merger of both Germanys, immediate monetary union and
privatization of state businesses.
   The Christian Democratic Union, German Social Union and
Democratic Awakening have formed a conservative election Alliance
for Germany.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   DEMOCRATIC AWAKENING
   Rainer Eppelmann, an East Berlin pastor, is chairman and top
candidate of Democratic Awakening.
   Eppelmann, 47, took over as party leader only three days before
Sunday's election following the resignation of Wolfgang Schnur.
Schnur quit after admitting he collaborated with the secret police.
   Eppelmann is a founding member of the party, which claims 55,000
members.
   In the 1960s, he was sentenced to jail for eight months as a
conscientious objector. By last month, Eppelmann became one of
several opposition Cabinet ministers in the Communist-led
transitional government.
   As a low-key pastor at East Berlin's Samaritan Church, he gave
refuge to pro-democracy demonstrators fleeing police during the
tense early phase of last fall's political upheaval.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GERMAN SOCIAL UNION
   Hans-Wilhelm Ebeling, a former Lutheran minister who heads the
conservative German Social Union, says socialism is a ``fantastic
idea that can't be realized with the kind of human beings God
created.''
   Despite his leading position in the party, Ebeling was not named
top candidate, partly because of his controversial role in the
popular revolt.
   Civil rights activists charge he only offered refuge in his
Leipzig church to pro-democracy groups when it became apparent the
old leaders were on their way out.
   In January, Ebeling, 56, stepped down as a minister to become a
politician.
   His party, which claims 35,000 members, favors rapid
unification, immediate monetary union with West Germany and a
free-market economy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NEW FORUM
   Jens Reich, 51, leading candidate of the grass-roots movement
New Forum, wants reunification to proceed slowly.
   ``We don't just want to be bad political copy of West Germany,''
said Reich, an expert on the application of computer technology in
biology and medicine.
   Reich frequently clashed with superiors over government-imposed
bureaucratic procedures, and in the 1980s joined church-sponsored
civil rights groups. Last fall, he co-founded New Forum and became
its chief ideologist.
   The group played a leading role in toppling the Communist
leadership but faded in importance as established West German
parties geared up to aid their emerging counterparts in the east.
   Reich, a physicist, urges far-reaching reforms in the areas of
constitutional law, medicine and health.
   New Forum claims more than 100,000 members.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   DEMOCRACY NOW
   Wolfgang Ullmann, the eloquent top candidate of the grass-roots
movement Democracy Now, is a favorite for the largely ceremonial
post of president because of his conciliatory attitude toward
political opponents.
   Ullmann, a 60-year-old philosopher and church historian, was a
political unknown until the popular revolt.
   Democracy Now, which claims about 3,000 members, favors gradual
unification but wants East Germany to retain a distinct identity.
   New Forum, Democracy Now and a smaller third group with similar
views, Initiative Peace and Human Rights, have formed an election
alliance called ``Union 90.''

   A building leased by the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration was gutted early today by a large
firebomb, and investigators were studying recent indictments in an
attempt to identify suspects, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported.
   ``Somebody bombed the DEA office by throwing a pipe bomb through
a window,'' said Frank Shultz, spokesman for the federal agency.
   ``All DEA personnel are accounted-for,'' he added. The bombing
occurred about 2:30 a.m.
   The fire gutted the 6,000-square-foot, one-story building at a
shopping-business mall, which the DEA leases, he said. There was no
immediate estimate of damage. The drug agency was the only tenant
in the building.
   A second explosion was reported during the night in a
residential area in south central Fort Myers, said Sheri Peterson,
a spokeswoman for the Lee County sheriff's office. She did not have
any details on the incident.
   She said there were no injuries in either incident. She would
not say whether the two bombings were related.
   John Fernandes, DEA spokesman from the Miami field office, said
federal agents were investigating numerous possibilities to find
who carried out the bombing.
   ``It could be one of many individuals,'' he said. ``If you look
at the productivity of the Fort Myers office ... they've been
knocking them dead lately. We're checking all the most recent
indictments.''
   Only Thursday, a drug indictment was issued in Fort Myers, and
two of those indicted are still at large, but federal officials
cautioned they are not connecting that indictment to the bombing
yet.
   Although the records at the office were destroyed, authorities
said there are copies at other locations.
   ``This is an act of desperation,'' said Fernandes. ``If they
think this is a setback for us, it's not. This shows we're on the
right track.''
   ``We are office-automated so a lot of what we put on paper, we
also put in computer. A lot of what you think we would lose, we
have duplicated copies of,'' Fernandes said.
   The second bombing may have been just a diversion, he said.
   Fort Myers is in southwestern Florida on the Gulf Coast.
   Shultz said the fire marshal at Fort Myers said the fire was
started by a ``large incendiary device.''

<HEAD>Rural Business Subsidy Advocates Regrouping After Setback</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Supporters of new subsidies to help rural
areas diversify their economies are having to regroup after being
dealt a severe setback in the House this past week.
   The floor managers of a rural development bill want to renew
their effort on the House floor but Senate experts now suggest the
effort may have better chances for success if it is folded into a
more comprehensive farm bill later this year.
   Designed to pump new life into dying villages and towns, the
bill by senior members of the House Agriculture Committee would
have allowed states to divert to industrial development federal
money now earmarked for sewer and water projects.
   About $600 million in existing water and sewer funds, another
$100 million designated for community facilities plus $100 million
devoted to business and industry development all would have been
pooled into one account.
   Sixteen-member state review panels then could divide their share
any way they wanted according to local priorities, with the
secretary of agriculture retaining ultimate authority on how the
money is distributed.
   Opponents, however, succeeded last Thursday in passing an
amendment that effectively prohibits commingling the three funds,
the only significant money in the bill for improving rural
conditions.
   Rep. Charles Rose, D-N.C., argued that intermixing the funds
would give the agriculture secretary too much discretionary power.
   Rose, whose state has received more than its initial allotment
of the funds under the current formula because other states did not
spend all of their share, also said taking money away from sewers
and water projects could be detrimental than the lack of new
business subsidies for rural areas.
   The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. E de la
Garza, D-Texas, and the chairman of its rural development
subcommittee, Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., said Friday they would
look for a new approach to save the bill.
   A significantly different rural development bill already has
been approved by the Senate.
   Sponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee, it features $300 million revolving fund for
new businesses and satellite education and health communications
systems.
   The Senate committee put together a comparison of the two bills
that says the House version would authorize $2.5 billion over five
years while the Senate measure would authorize $1.5 billion over
the same period.
   While the House bill would establish a new agency to organize
the programs, the Senate version simply directs the agriculture
secretary to ``review and report on reorganization.''
   The Senate bill would provide new grants and loans for rural
schools, medical providers and telecommunications business
partnerships. The House measure includes only a policy statement
saying that existing agencies should continue financing
telecommunications infrastructure improvements.

<TEXT>
   Minnesota farmer Owen Gustafson has little in
common with the ambassador of Belize, but they agree on one thing:
the U.S. sugar program is encouraging Latin American peasants to
grow illegal drugs.
   Gustafson, a corn and wheat grower from Montevideo, Minn., told
a House committee last week that Belize became the world's fourth
largest exporter of marijuana after its U.S. sugar exports were cut
by 75 percent.
   ``The loss of a market place due to the U.S. sugar program
pushed people into drug trafficking,'' Gustafson said.
   The tiny Central American country is one of several
sugar-producing nations from Mexico to Argentina that is lobbying
Congress to loosen the import quotas that help prop up prices for
U.S. sugar growers.
   Complaints about the import quotas are a key part of this year's
debate about renewing the 8-year-old sugar program, one of the most
controversial components of American farm policy.
   The program is the bread and butter of many farmers in eastern
North Dakota and western Minnesota, who grow 40 percent of U.S.
sugar beets.
   The program guarantees a minimum price for sugar that works out
to 18 cents per pound for sugar from cane and 21.5 cents per pound
for beet sugar. The Bush administration has proposed to leave the
sugar program alone in the 1990 farm bill.
   However, the administration has raised the ire of sugar
producers by proposing to replace the import quotas with tariffs
because of rulings under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
that the quota system is unfair.
   Sugar growers want the administration to leave the quotas alone
and are asking Congress to raise the minimum price that farmers are
paid.
   ``The sugar program is a farm program. It is not a foreign aid
program,'' Ronald Hayes, president of Moorhead, Minn.-based
American Crystal Sugar Co., said in testimony before a House
Agriculture subcommittee.
   ``Its primary function is to insulate U.S. sugar producers as
well as consumers from the unfair, undependable and unstable world
... sugar market,'' Hayes said.
   But Belize and other countries say the import quotas have
stymied their efforts at economic development and democratization.
   Several sugar mills in the 14 Caribbean and Central American
sugar-growing countries have been closed down because the U.S.
quota has been cut in half over the past five years _ from 1.1
million to 570,000 tons, said Belize Ambassador Edward Laing.
   The Group of Latin American and Caribbean Sugar Exporting
Countries _ an organization of 22 countries that accounts for 45
percent of world sugar exports _ claims its U.S. shipments fell
from 3.2 million tons in 1981 to 950,000 in 1988.
   ``It is a fact that until our sugar situation is stabilized, it
will be impossible to achieve economic growth and social stability
in the ... region,'' Laing said.
   But the American Sugarbeet Growers Association proposed Congress
boost the minimum price to 20 cents per pound and require the
administration to raise the price further to keep up with future
increases in production costs.
   The association's president, Patrick Mahar, said world sugar
prices ranged from 2.7 cents to 41 cents per pound during the 1980s.
   However, the Sweetener Users Association, an industry group,
claims consumers are paying artificially high prices for sugar.
   Production of sugar cane and beets increased from 6.2 million
tons in 1981 to 7.1 million tons in 1988, according to the group,
which maintains that U.S. farmers have been encouraged to grow too
much sugar.

   In a twist to the Israeli-American military
relationship, the United States is trying to sell Israel a
sophisticated anti-missile defense system, but the Israelis are not
sure they want to buy.
   The case reflects the impact that the reduced Soviet threat in
Europe is having on thriving U.S. defense manufacturers.
   Usually, Israel is the one pressing the United States to sell it
weapons systems. This time, the Defense Department and the Raytheon
Co. of Lexington, Mass., are the ones doing the pressing.
   Raytheon manufactures the Patriot, a land-based missile system
originally designed to shoot down aircraft. Several years ago,
Raytheon reconfigured the system so it also could shoot down
medium-range missiles.
   Israel could use the weapon to respond to a growing threat from
vastly increased missile arsenals in the Arab world. Israel is
especially worried about chemical warheads which two of its most
implacable enemies _ Syria and Iraq _ reportedly have.
   The $100 million Patriot package comes equipped with a radar to
detect and track targets and a command center to issue firing
instructions to the missiles.
   In an annual report of possible arms sales for fiscal year 1990,
the State Department informed Congress that Israel may buy the
Patriot. Under Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz discussed
details of the sale on a visit to Israel in January.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told young American Jewish leaders
several days ago that discussions about the Patriot sale were under
way.
   But sources close to the deal say Israel is far from sold.
   ``There's still a long way to go toward a possible purchase _ I
say possible and not necessarily probable,'' said one source who
spoke on condition of anonymity. He said a decision is not expected
for several months.
   In Israel last week, a military official said the Patriot ``only
gives limited solution to the missile problem, so we don't intend
to buy it at this stage.''
   ``We are looking at other systems,'' the official said, whil
declining to elaborate.
   Israel's dilemma is the cost versus the threat. For the $200
million the United States is asking for two Patriot systems Israel
would need, it could produce the next generation of an anti-missile
missile, known as the Arrow.
   The Arrow program is a component of the Strategic Defense
Initiative, the space-based defense system being developed by the
United States, which the Pentagon has farmed out to Israel for
research and development.
   The first phase of the Arrow project began in 1988 and is due
for completion this year, ahead of schedule, U.S. officials say.
The first test-firing is expected this July and another three by
July 1991.
   The second phase, which would prepare the missile for
production, reportedly would cost about $200 million. Israel would
like the SDI program to foot the bill for the second phase, but the
Pentagon has not decided.
   ``I would expect this is going to be a difficult decision,''
said Gen. Robert Hammond, commander of the Army Strategic Defense
Command at Huntsville, Ala., where SDI research is conducted.
   U.S. officials say the main focus of the Arrow development is to
design an effective response to chemical warheads. ``They're trying
to get up to negate the chemical threat,'' said Edward L.
Wilkinson, director of the Kinetic Energy Weapons Directorate of
the U.S. Army.
   In any event, the Arrow would not be ready for deployment for
another five to 10 years. The Patriot, said one U.S. official, ``is
a Band-Aid for the meantime, but an expensive one.''
   Among other concerns, Israeli officials say, is whether the
Patriot could effectively destroy a chemical warhead without
risking fallout of lethal poisons on populated areas. The distances
between Israel and its Arab neighbors are so small that this is an
important concern.
   In addition, in order to be effective, the Patriot radar would
have to be cued by satellite-borne early warning systems _
something Israel does not possess.
   An arrangement would have to be worked out with the United
States to supply that service, a U.S. official said. This would
make Israel dependent on the United States to a degree it is
reluctant to accept, an Israeli source said.
   Raytheon, which has sold the Patriot to West Germany and The
Netherlands, is eager to sell to Israel too, U.S. officials say.
   It already has had one setback with Italy, which agreed in
principle to buy the Patriot but which now is hesitating in light
of the changing defense needs in Europe, officials say.
   Defense Week, a trade publication, reported last month that
1,200 Raytheon employees could lose their jobs unless Italy agrees
this month to the $500 million deal. A ompany spokeswoman declined
to discuss the report.
   The company already has been hard hit by the Pentagon's decision
to stop the production of the anti-aircraft Hawk missiles.

   Claude Montana scored a solid hit Saturday with his
ready-to-wear show for winter, putting him right back at the top of
the fashion big leagues after a brief stumble.
   With his trapeze coats, use of furs and soft leathers, and
bright colors, Montana soared back as a fashion leader after his
disappointing debut in haute couture for Lanvin in January.
   Looking rather like low-keyed ready-to-wear, the Lanvin show
drew harsh criticism from many. But in this offering for his own
line, Montana proved to be a master.
   The fast-paced show led off with a ``Sergeant Pepper'' group of
bright yellow and red fitted military jackets and chain fastenings
over fitted slim pants.
   He then laid on a group of full trapeze-line mini-coats in a
dressy new stiffened wool-faille fabric. These sometimes topped
miniskirts with matching bright tights and bootees. More often he
opted for stirrup-bottomed stretch satin fabrics, sometimes
stitched or seamed up the sides.
   Montana had been rumored to be very depressed over reaction to
his Lanvin show, but with colors like mandarin orange, bright
yellow, chartreuse and cornflower blue, it appeared optimism had
won out.
   Montana also had a field day with his favorite sheared minks,
turning out parkas, trapeze shorties or anoraks in the furs. They
usually had hoods or wide collars, framing hooded ribbed knits
underneath.
   The hooded ``Canadiennes'' are a big trend running through all
current worldwide shows, and no one does them better than Montana.
   His drawstring parkas also looked better than most anybody
else's. The ``little red riding hoods'' were sensational in
Velsaquez red or pine green soft suede called nubuk, worn with
matching minis or cigarette pants with high heels.
   There were also quilted suede anoraks and boleros and fitted,
zippered suits in shiny calf with its fur, plus a big puff of
daffodil yellow mongolian lamb over the lean lines underneath
belted in bright red.
   As a change of pace, Montana showed a quieter line of silvery
gray flannel suits, elegantly fitted with rib seams, plus a few
chinchilla jackets over the skirts, cigarette pants or jumpsuits.
   His Mondrian line of tent-like coats in big solids of red,
yellow, or bright blue combined with patches of white and gray
topped bi-colored lean jersey pants or minis.
   At the venerated house of Balenciaga, Michel Goma got a big hand
for his jazzy collection, also full of furs and eye-catching colors.
   Goma, who briefly had his own fashion house that closed in 1963
and then worked for Patou, came to Balenciaga a couple of seasons
ago. He did little to emulate Balenciaga's perfect chic, but this
was ready-to-wear.
   The daytime clothes were better than evening looks that could be
summed up by ``sequined glitz'' _ sparkly, but otherwise
unimpressive.
   His opening number of belted big cable-knit jackets in algae or
moss green combined with silver minis and belts were new.
   There were good teal blue or chartreuse jackets in boucle
houndstooth patterns over short-skirted jersey tunic suits.
   Goma did some good dressy looks with watery moire silk, often
topping sheaths with decollete ruffled jackets or shrug boleros in
black or red-green combinations.
   He won out in both his fake ``ecological'' and real furs. There
were long bi-colored golden and chestnut sable coats, a black
breitschwantz maxi, mini coats in black or red beaver.
   His excellent fakes included a belted panther jacket with a big
collar over a lean miniskirt.
   The Gres boutique show by Japanese Takeshi Sasaki started out
well enough with handsome brown trapeze coats, velvet and
ribbed-knit fitted jackets over lean cropped pants.
   But things got very heavy with a series of dreary long jerseys
in tones of beige, mouse gray and brown. There wasn't a jewel or
bright scarf in sight to pep up the clothes, which resembled at
times a schoolmistress' outfit.

<HEAD>Fur Coat Going From Status Symbol To Stigma</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIELA PETROFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fur coat is quickly going from status symbol to
stigma as conservation groups and anti-fur activists step up the
campaign to help animals save their skins.
   ``It takes 40 dumb animals to make a fur coat, but only one to
wear it,'' says the slogan emblazoned across T-shirts by the
British animal rights group Lynx.
   The use of endangered species, such as leopard and tiger, for
fur coats has been illegal more than a decade. But it was not until
recent years that activists declared war on the use of any pelt,
from the ranch mink to the wild sable.
   The campaign started in the United States and gathered such
momentum that citizens of Aspen, Colo., recently tried to pass a
law to ban the sale of fur. The attempt failed, but the point was
made.
   In Europe, where women don their furs from October through March
regardless of the weather, the movement started more slowly. But
taking the cue from England, anti-fur branches of animal rights
groups have cropped up across the continent.
   The European fur industry's most visible setback was the closing
in February of the fur salon at Harrods department store in London.
It had clad the rich and famous nearly a century.
   The store said sales had dropped more than 40 percent in the
past four years.
   Celebrities such as Paul and Linda McCartney and the former
model Twiggy support animal rights groups in England. Actress Kate
O'Mara now writes her refusal to wear fur coats into her contracts,
after she was forced to wear one in episodes of ``Dynasty.''
   Across the Channel, French furriers have also suffered losses _
a drop in sales of 27 percent to 30 percent over the past three
years _ according to Georges Constant president of the French
furriers' guild.
   Constant blames mild winters and rising prices as much as the
ecologists for fur's waning popularity.
   Moreover, French furriers, far from being on the run, are
fighting back against activists they consider out of line.
   According to Constant, the guild recently won a lawsuit against
a film that showed animals being killed and was described by its
maker as a documentary. The guild insisted the film was an
advertisement.
   The fur coat is still popular among Germans, and the annual fur
fair in Frankfurt continues to be Europe's major fur event.
   However, animal rights groups connected with the powerful
environmentalist Greens party stage periodic protests, including
demonstrations at Christmas in front of major department stores
with fur salons.
   In recent years, anti-fur activists also have released a number
of minks from mink ranches near the city of Mainz.
   Surprisingly, sunny Italy is one of Europe's largest fur
consumers. According to a recent survey, 5.9 million women, nearly
one out of four in Italy, own at least one fur coat.
   The Anti-Vivisection League, linked to the local Greens party,
is trying to turn the trend around with demonstrations, fur-coat
bonfires, and the freeing of animals from fur farms.
   On March 10, the activists demonstrated on the streets of Pavia,
where Italy's largest fur manufacturer, Annabella, has its
headquarters. They carried a small coffin and shouted slogans such
as, ``A fur on your shoulders, means blood on your hands!''
   The Italian Greens have proposed a law that would ban animal fur
production, sales and imports by January 1994. To help furriers
convert their businesses, a tax of 50 percent would be levied on
furs bought before 1994.
   Italian furriers have accused animal rights groups of
``boycotting'' commerce, a crime in Italy, with their anti-fur
campaigns.
   During March shows in Milan for ready-to-wear collections for
fall and winter, Fendi, Italy's most prestigious fur label, showed
coats and jackets with fur on the inside.
   Paola Fendi, head of the company, said the intention was not to
hide the fur from conservationists, but simply to show one side of
a reversible coat.
   ``We are furriers and proud of it,'' said Fendi. ``We introduced
the reversible fur because it is a fashionable and practical
solution for the traveling career woman.''
   Many of France's and Italy's top designers such as Dior, Yves
Saint Laurent, Armani, and Ferre have created chic fake furs.
   But these copies are not cheap _ they go for an average $3,000.

   Former President Jimmy Carter urged Arab
leaders Saturday to reconsider the 1979 Camp David peace accord
between Israel and Egypt to reach a settlement in the Arab-Israeli
dispute.
   Carter also said Soviet Jewish immigration to the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip would be ``an impediment
to peace,'' and expressed hope that a new government in Israel will
lead to Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
   The government-run Sawt Ash-Shaab newspaper described Carter's
visit to the Middle East as a ``waste of time.''
   But Carter declared: ``If you go back now and re-examine the
Camp David agreement, you would see that it provides a framework
for peace.''
   His comments were made during an informal meeting with members
of Jordan's parliament.
   Carter, who brokered the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian treaty, said: ``I
don't maintain that the Camp David accord is a perfect document,
but it can obviously be a binding document.''
   He noted that the Israeli parliament had approved the Camp David
accord, which includes the recognition of a U.N. resolution calling
for Israeli withdrawal from the areas captured in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   ``This was the first time Israel ever approved Resolution 242,''
he said.
   That resolution also calls for the right of all parties,
including Israel, to live in peace within secure borders.
   The accord led to Egypt becoming the only Arab country to have a
peace treaty with Israel.
   Carter said Arab leaders could select ``the parts they want from
the agreement in light of the present-day circumstances.''
   Israel continues to occupy the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
more than 600 Palestinians have died since an uprising against
Israeli rule began in December 1987.
   Commenting on Arab concerns over Soviet Jewish immigration to
Israel and the occupied zones, Carter said: ``I share this concern
with you.
   ``To the extent that Israeli officials are using the Soviet
Jewish immigration to populate the occupied territories, it is
indeed counterproductive, an impediment to peace and an unexcusable
exploitation of the Soviet Jews who deserve support and peaceful
existance and an opportunity to be free,'' he said.
   Israeli leaders are expecting thousands of Soviet Jews to arrive
in their country, largely because of Moscow's easing of emigration
rules.
   Israeli officials have repeatedly denied there is a government
policy of settling Soviet Jews in the occupied lands and say only
about 200 of 12,000 Soviet Jews who arrived last year settled in
the territories.
   Nevertheless, the issue has alarmed Arabs, who fear they may be
pushed out to make room for the new arrivals.
   Representatives of nine members of the Organization of Islamic
Conference met Saturday in Saudi Arabia to discuss measures to
counter the mass emigration.
   The group's secretary-general, Hamid al-Gabid, said the influx
of Soviet Jews will ``create major upheavals in the region, change
its demography, undermine Palestinian rights, lead to the
confiscation of more Palestinian land, the setting up of more
settlements and strengthen the Israeli military apparatus.''
   Carter said Soviet officials recently assured him Moscow was
``contemplating a change in the Soviet law'' to persuade Jews to
remain in the Soviet Union.
   This includes allowing the return of hundreds of thousands of
Soviet Jews who emigrate, and allowing more religious and cultural
freedom for Jews, Carter said.
   He spoke out in favor of convening an international peace
conference on the Middle East after the Arabs and Israel ``reach an
adequate and mutual trust.''
   Commenting on the fall of hard-line Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's government, and efforts to form a new
administration led by rival Labor Party leader Shimon Peres, Carter
said: ``Mr. Shamir has never been ready to sit and talk to
Palestinians.
   ``Labor are ready ... to advocate that a decision has to be made
to begin talks with the Palestinians,'' he added.
   Shamir lost a vote of no-confidence in parliament last week over
his refusal to accept compromises to get preliminary peace talks
under way.
   Carter and his wife, Rosalyn, flew in from Syria on Friday. He
will visit Israel and the occupied territories Sunday.
   The visit tothe region is Carter's fourth since he left office
in 1981.

<HEAD>Racketeering Case Against Imelda Marcos Goes to Trial This Week</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Four years after Ferdinand Marcos' ouster from
power and six months after his death, his widow goes to trial this
week for her role in the alleged plunder of millions of dollars
from the Philippine treasury.
   The racketeering case against Imelda Marcos begins Tuesday with
jury selection in Manhattan's federal court. The testimony,
chronicling a tale of international intrigue and rich and famous
players, is expected to take months.
   Prosecutors will try to prove Mrs. Marcos helped in the illegal
transfer of more than $160 million, allegedly obtained in the
Philippines through bribes, kickbacks and embezzlement, to buy four
commercial buildings in Manhattan.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, also is accused of defrauding banking
institutions of more than $165 million in financing that real
estate and of obstructing justice in a civil lawsuit filed by the
Filipino government to reclaim the properties.
   The government has said her prosecution will not be affected by
the death of her husband, who was the central figure in the October
1988 indictment. Marcos had been severed from the case because of
ill health before he died Sept. 28 in exile in Hawaii.
   Despite the paper trail that the government will follow, the
trial won't lack personality _ not when its central figure left
behind 1,060 pairs of shoes in the Philippines, wore a full-length
chiffon gown to her arraignment and who has friends like tobacco
heiress Doris Duke to post her $5 million bail.
   Mrs. Marcos' co-defendant, Adnan Khashoggi, is somewhat of a
celebrity himself. The jet-set Saudi financier is accused of
helping the Marcoses hide their ownership of the properties through
false documents. He also is said to have been the main financier
and middleman in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Much name-dropping is expected. Pretrial papers filed by
prosecutors include correspondence between the Marcoses and Ronald
and Nancy Reagan and mention of actor George Hamilton as one of
many unindicted co-conspirators.
   Mrs. Marcos' lead attorney, Gerald Spence, is sure to draw
attention as the trial progresses. Spence, of Jackson, Wyo., has a
showy courtroom manner and a penchant for Western attire.
   He has been called a maverick for his choice of clients, like
the heirs of Karen Silkwood, and for his books criticizing the
criminal justice system.
   In an interview, Spence said he felt the prosecution of Mrs.
Marcos was unfair in light of the close relationship she had with
five U.S. presidents during Marcos' 20 years in power. Marcos was
ousted as president in 1986 after a popular revolt.
   ``Now suddenly these people become the enemies of this nation
when it's convenient and useful to do so,'' Spence said.
   ``There couldn't be a more frustrated and lonely person in the
world than a widow who's been charged with racketeering, not only
by her own government, but by the government of the United States
of America,'' he said earlier in an interview in the Jackson Hole
News of Wyoming. ``She's a helpless widow without many friends. I
want to be her friend. I want to represent her.''
   He declined to preview his defense strategy or say whether Mrs.
Marcos would testify.
   Her lawyers had tried unsuccessfully to get the charges thrown
out before the trial. U.S. District Judge John Keenan denied their
claims that Mrs. Marcos couldn't be prosecuted because she had been
abducted to the United States after the 1986 revolt and because she
had immunity on the grounds that her husband was a head of state.
   Earlier this year, Mrs. Marcos rejected a proposed plea bargain
that attorneys said would have allowed for a suspended prison
sentence. Attorneys in the case said negotiations broke down over
the issue of how much money Mrs. Marcos would have to forfeit as
part of the plea bargain.
   The government's case against Mrs. Marcos was bolstered by the
recent guilty plea of a co-defendant, Rodolfo Arambulo, the former
president of the Los Angeles-based California Overseas Bank.
   Prosecutors had alleged that the bank was partially owned by
Marcos and was involved in some of the illegal financial
transactions. Arambulo, whose plea to a lesser charge of conspiracy
was hinged on his cooperation, is a potential witness against Mrs.
Marcos.
   The bank itself, which was also to have gone on trial with Mrs.
Marcos on charges of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy,
pleaded guilty Friday to wire fraud. Through its attorney, the bank
admitted that certain officers had opened fictitious accounts to
enable transfer of funds to the United States from the Philippines.
The plea did not specify who received the funds.
   The specific charges to which Mrs. Marcos has pleaded innocent
are racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, obstruction of justice
and mail fraud. If convicted of all the charges, she faces a
maximum prison term of 50 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
   Under the racketeering laws, prosecutors are seeking all
property obtained through illegal activity. For Mrs. Marcos, that
includes the four New York buildings, foreign bank accounts and
other property interest she holds.
   Khashoggi, who was a fugitive until his arrest in Switzerland
last summer, had originally been charged with racketeering, mail
fraud and obstruction of justice.
   But because Swiss authorities declined to extradite him to the
U.S. on racketeering, he is being tried only on the remaining two
charges. Together they carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in
prison and a $500,000 fine.
   Five other people named in the indictment are fugitives. They
are Bienvenido Tantoco Sr., former Philippine ambassador to the
Vatican; his wife, Gliceria, once president of a Philippine
department store; their son, Bienvenido Tantoco Jr.; former
California Overseas Bank chairman Roberto S. Benedicto; and Karl
Bock Peterson, an associate of Khashoggi.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela on Saturday
deplored recent black factional fighting that has left about 300
people dead and said it indicated a surge in popular resentment of
the apartheid system.
   Mandela, returning from a five-nation foreign trip, said that as
soon as he is briefed by local black leaders about the wave of
violence in black townships and tribal homelands, ``we will go into
action'' to stop it.
   But he said the violence was clearly a rejection by blacks of
the apartheid system, and showed that the government policy of
separating blacks into their own areas ``has no popular support
whatsoever.''
   Speaking at an airport news conference, Mandela also said he
would not meet U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III in South
Africa, because a Baker visit would indicate approval of the
white-led government.
   Mandela said he would be willing to meet Baker elsewhere. ``If
the secretary of state wants to see me, of course I'll see him,''
he said. ``But I will not meet him in South Africa.''
   Baker has invited Mandela to meet him in Namibia. The two are
scheduled to attend the South African colony's independence
celebrations Wednesday.
   Baker then will go to Cape Town, where he is scheduled to meet
President F.W. de Klerk, other government officials, and some black
leaders.
   ``We do not want any high-profile visits to South Africa because
these can result in a lot of confusion,'' Mandela said.
   ``They suggest that President de Klerk has done something
positive, something fundamental which requires the world to review
sanctions and other strategies which we have invited in order to
increase pressure on South Africa,'' he said.
   De Klerk won praise from many world leaders after he legalized
the African National Congress and 60 other organizations, freed
Mandela from prison, lifted some press restrictions, reduced the
influence of the military and desegregated the nation's beaches.
   After the news conference, Mandela attended a concert where some
of the country's top musicians sang a song composed in his honor,
``The People Want Mandela.'' Waving a small ANC flag, he told the
crowd of about 10,000 that they should be grateful to the people of
foreign countries who supported their cause over the years.
   During his trip abroad, Mandela called for a cutoff of all
diplomatic ties to South Africa. U.S. officials and leaders of
other nations say they believe diplomatic contact gives them more
of a chance of influencing Pretoria.
   Mandela has praised de Klerk as a man of integrity but says the
ANC is not planning its strategy based on one man but on the
policies of the National Party government. The government still
denies the black majority the right to vote, to choose where to
live, go to school, or receive medical treatment.
   Mandela, 71, was elected deputy president of the ANC when he
began his tour in Zambia early this month. He is the effective
leader of the group while ANC President Oliver Tambo recuperates in
Sweden from a recent stroke.
   Mandela said he will lead a delegation of internal and exiled
ANC leaders in talks April 11 with de Klerk. The talks are intended
to clear obstacles to formal black-white negotiations.
   De Klerk has not met all the ANC's conditions for formal
negotiations. They include ending the state of emergency, freeing
all political prisoners, ending political persecution, and
guaranteeing the safe return of all exiles.
   About 700 people, many in ANC colors, gathered at a football
stadium Saturday at the edge of Katlehong, a black township south
of Johannesburg where 14 people have died in the past week. The
violence started as a dispute between taxi organizations.
   Twelve coffins of victims from both sides were draped in flowers
and blankets in front of the grandstand as relatives huddled around
them and speakers urged reconciliation.

   Tens of thousands of Iraqi protesters
marched in the capital and other cities Saturday to express anger
at the British measures taken to censure Iraq for hanging a
London-based journalist accused of spying.
   President Saddam Hussein flew to Saudi Arabia for consultations
with King Fahd. The official Saudi Press Agency said Fahd invited
Hussein after the international uproar over the execution of Farzad
Bazoft. The 31-year-old Iranian-born journalist worked for the
Observer, a British Sunday newspaper.
   No details of their talks were released.
   The official radio said demonstrators in all major Iraqi cities
swept through the streets chanting support for Hussein's decision.
Bazoft was hanged Thursday, four days after a closed-door
revolutionary security court sentenced him to death. He denied the
charges of spying for Israel and Britain.
   After the execution, Britain withdrew its ambassador, expelled
six Iraqi military students and canceled all ministerial visits.
But it resisted demands to break off relations and impose economic
sanctions.
   Residents in Iraq's major port city of Basra and in the northern
city of Mosul said thousands demonstrated against Britain for what
Iraq called ``interfering in Iraq's internal affairs and protecting
spies.''
   Speakers outside the besieged British Embassy in downtown
Baghdad clamored for a tough position against the ``British
colonialists.''
   Officials of the ruling Baath Socialist Party estimated that
100,000 people turned out in Baghdad. Protesters carried placards
praising the government's decision to hang Bazoft.
   No violence was reported.
   Demonstrators sent a cable to Hussein urging him to take a
tougher position against Britain.
   ``Chop off the heads of all spies and silence their dirty
tongues,'' said the cable, broadcast on state-run radio.
   The report also said the protesters handed a letter of protest
to the British Embassy press officer expressing outrage over
London's denunciation of the execution.
   The Embassy was ringed by police officers and plainclothes
security agents. They blocked the main entrance to the compound
with their cars. No embassy personnel were seen in the compound,
where they usually play tennis or hold exercise sessions Saturday
mornings.
   About 3,000 Britons live in Iraq, including a large business
community in Baghdad. There have been no reports of any trouble
involving them.
   Schools and universities were let out for the day in Baghdad and
other cities so students could join the demonstrations.
   The official radio and television suspended their normal
programs to broadcast the protests and national songs praising
Hussein. The radio also broadcast telegrams of support and
solidarity from Arab professional organizations and labor unions.
   ``Journalism should not be used as a camouflage for spying,''
said a letter of support by the Baghdad-based General Federation of
Arab journalists.
   The radio also broadcast statements of support by King Hussein
of Jordan and Salah Khalaf, a ranking member of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Khalaf was quoted as saying the British protest amounted to
interference in Iraq's affairs, while King Hussein said Iraq had a
right to protect its national security.
   Bazoft was arrested in September along with British nurse Daphne
Parish while he was investigating reports of a major explosion at a
secret Iraqi military research complex south of Baghdad.
   Mrs. Parish was sentenced to 15 years in prison.
   Iraqi newspapers focused on Barzoft's criminal record in
Britain. He served a year in prison in 1981-82 for robbing a
savings and loan office of $764 while he was a student living in
central England.
   State-controlled newspapers stepped up the anti-British campaign.
   The government-owned Al-Jomhuriya daily declared in a front-page
editorial: ``The British government should understand well that the
Iraq of Saddam Hussein is not an estate whose doors are open to
spies and agents.''
   The demonstrations Saturday were the first against a foreign
mission since similar marches were organized against the U.S.
Embassy in fall 1988 after the United States accused Iraq of using
chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels.
   Residents in the embassy area recalled the protests against
Britain in July 1958 after the military coup that toppled the
monarchy. At that time, protesters set fire to the same embassy
building and ransacked it.
   Britain governed Iraq under a League of Nations mandate after
World War I, when the Ottoman empire was broken up, until
independence in 1932.
   ``History repeats itself, but this time more quietly,'' said an
old man living near the embassy.

<HEAD>Tuesday's Illinois Primary a Battle of Ideology, Party Factions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Factional and ideological splits loom
large in Illinois' primary election Tuesday as party leaders face
tests of their once-unquestioned authority to name candidates for
the fall election.
   The Democratic Party wants to put two women on their statewide
ticket for the first time and keep the patronage-rich post of Cook
County Board president in the hands of party regulars. The party's
slated candidates in those races face hotly contested primaries
unheard-of in the heyday of the late Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley.
   ``I think ever since Richard J. Daley passed from the scene,
there's been many people who've adopted an independent political
course,'' said Rep. William Lipinski of Chicago, who has broken
ranks with party leaders on key primary races.
   Daley died in 1976 after 21 years as Chicago mayor; his son,
Richard M. Daley, was elected mayor last year.
   For Republicans, the election will measure the depth of a
conservative insurgency against Secretary of State Jim Edgar, the
gubernatorial candidate regarded by the party hierarchy as its best
hope of retaining the Executive Mansion, now occupied by retiring
four-term Gov. James R. Thompson.
   Strategists of both parties say the outcome of primary races may
hinge on turnout. State election officials this week predicted that
little more than one-fourth of the state's 6 million registered
voters would cast ballots.
   ``Our gut reaction is that it will be somewhat of a low
turnout,'' said Gary LaPaille, a campaign organizer for Democratic
Party regulars. ``Not one race has really charged Democratic voters
throughout the state.''
   Wary that contested primary can be expensive and create
lingering bitterness, both parties have with few exceptions ensured
their major candidates a clear shot at nomination for the fall
election.
   Sen. Paul Simon is unopposed in his primary, as is his
Republican challenger, Rep. Lynn Martin. The winner of the
Republican gubernatorial primary will face Attorney General Neil
Hartigan, a Democrat who also is unopposed on Tuesday.
   Democrats kept their primary relatively quiet in part by
successfully challenging the nominating petitions of a slate of
disciples of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche. Four years ago,
two LaRouche disciples threw the party into turmoil with upset
victories over slated candidates in the primary.
   Last fall, party leaders sought to boost prospects for their
statewide ticket by slating two female state legislators, Sen. Dawn
Clark Netsch of Chicago and Rep. Peg McDonnell Breslin of Ottawa,
for the state posts of comptroller and treasurer.
   But state party Chairman Vince Demuzio acknowledged that Mrs.
Breslin is an underdog in her race against Patrick Quinn, a
populist political activist, and Mrs. Netsch was locked in a
four-way race with polls indicating few voters had made up their
minds.
   On the Republican side, Edgar is being challenged by
conservative political organizer, Steven Baer, 30, who has attacked
Edgar's pro-choice stance on abortion and his more moderate
position on taxes. Another conservative, physician Robert Marshall,
is conducting a low-profile campaign.
   A statewide poll earlier this month found 59 percent of voters
favored Edgar against 13 percent for Baer, 3 percent for Marshall
and 24 percent undecided. The telephone poll of 637 registered
voters had a 4-point margin of error.
   With the cast of characters largely set by both parties for next
fall's election, much attention in the Chicago area has been drawn
to the Democratic contest for the powerful post of president of the
Cook County Board.
   Recent polls have indicated the front-runners are Richard
Phelan, a Chicago attorney who headed an ethics investigation of
former House Speaker Jim Wright, and Eugene Pincham, a black
appellate court judge. The candidate endorsed by local party
leaders, state Sen. Ted Lechowicz, has been running last in the
polls.
   ``In Cook County, different factions are going different
directions and that is part of the problem,'' said state party
chairman Demuzio. ``In the old days, there was a lot of
discipline.''
   Chicago also is the scene of primary challenges to a pair of
Democratic congressmen, Gus Savage and Sidney Yates. Both were in
the toughest races of their careers, with Savage facing educator
Melvin Reynolds and Yates opposed by Chicago Alderman Edwin
Eisendrath.

   Libya on Saturday accused ``hostile intelligence
services'' of causing the fire at a plant suspected of producing
poison gas, and it singled out the United States, Israel and West
Germany.
   The official Libyan news agency JANA said a source at the
country's Foreign Ministry declared the plant ``was subjected to a
terrorist sabotage operation which expressed organized state
terrorism by hostile intelligence services, causing a huge fire.''
   The blaze broke out Wednesday at the plant in Rabta, about 60
miles southwest of Tripoli. Libya says the plant produces
medicines, but the United States and West Germany have charged it
produces poison gas.
   Following the blaze, Libya accused West Germany of involvement.
The JANA reports Saturday, however, appeared to shift the blame to
the United States.
   Both countries as well as Israel have denied involvement in the
fire. President Bush on Saturday repeated this denial during a
phone conversation with Egypt's president, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
   President Hosni Mubarak initiated the call, the state-run news
agency reported. It did not say which leader brought up the subject
of the fire, or whether Bush volunteered the denial or made it in
reply to a question from Mubarak.
   ``President Bush assured President Mubarak ... that he had
nothing to do with what happened ... despite previously declared
U.S. objections to industries that might be related to chemical
weapons,'' the agency said.
   JANA, monitored in Rome, said one of the aims of the ``cowardly
act'' was to refute Libyan assertions that the Rabta plant produces
medicines.
   ``However, this act, on the contrary, refuted the claims of
America, West Germany and the Zionists,'' JANA said.
   It said the Foreign Ministry source, whom it did not identify,
``recalled the statements by the official spokesman of the American
administration in which he did not rule out sabotage against the
said factory.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater earlier this month called
for the Rabta plant to be shut down and said Washington did not
rule out a military strike at the factory.
   The Libyan source quoted by JANA said the Foreign Ministry
``warns world public opinion of the dangers of repetition of such
hostile acts by the American administration against the Libyan Arab
people.''
   The official also was quoted as saying that ``colonial
countries, headed by the United States of America and the Zionist
enemy, were exerting their utmost efforts to prevent Arab countries
from peaceful development,'' including the production of medicines.
   In a separate dispatch by its Arab affairs editor, JANA also
accused the United States of causing the Rabta fire.
   The editor said ``the American administration, once it was sure
that fire was (set) to Al-Rabta pharmaceutical factory ... is
directing now its usual claims against Iraq.''
   He said he was referring to a U.S. television report that said
Iraq was setting up a reactor for uranium production to make
nuclear weapons.
   A previously unknown organization, purportedly representing
Libyan army dissidents, claimed responsibility for setting
Wednesday's blaze in a telephone call to the Cairo bureau of the
West German news agency ARD.
   Foreign correspondents have not been allowed into Libya since
the fire. Reporters were taken to the chemical plant in January
1989 but not allowed to inspect it.
   U.S. officials have said the fire made the plant inoperable.
   The United States attacked Libyan forces three times in the
1980s, twice shooting down Libyan fighter planes and bombing
Tripoli in 1986 for what former President Reagan said was terrorism
against Americans in Europe.

<HEAD>Pentagon Silent on Reports That New Spy Satellite Failing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $500 million satellite that was launched
less than a month ago to spy on the Soviet Union has started
falling apart, according to a Soviet report that the Pentagon on
Saturday refused to confirm.
   The report by the Novosti news agency said four orbiting
fragments were spotted on March 7 that ``presumably separated from
the American spy satellite.''
   A U.S. space agency official said such fragments can be
non-essential pieces such as protective ``shrouds.'' But The
Washington Post said members of Congress and the intelligence
community were told the satellite had suffered a malfunction.
   There was disagreement in Washington over the impact of such a
loss of data-gathering capability, especially in light of eased
tensions between the two superpowers.
   Should the satellite or pieces of it fall toward Earth,
presumably over the Soviet Union, they most likely would
disintegrate in the atmosphere.
   Novosti said scientists who analyzed the orbits of the fragments
believe the objects will fall to Earth, possibly over northern
regions of the Soviet Union, between Monday and April 10.
   The Defense Department spokesman James Turner would not comment
on the Novosti or Post reports other than to read a prepared
statement.
   ``Space shuttle mission STS-36 achieved its goal associated with
a classified DOD program,'' the statement said. ``Hardware elements
associated with the mission are expected to re-enter the earth's
atmosphere. We believe there is no risk to life or property.''
   The Pentagon has never acknowledged that it sent a satellite up
with the Feb. 28 launch of the Atlantis shuttle. But sources told
The Associated Press during the mission that the secret cargo was a
satellite capable of taking detailed pictures of the Soviet Union.
The radar-generated images, a new technology, can be obtained even
through cloud cover.
   The satellite, which was cast into orbit March 1, also is
designed to tune in on electronic communications all over the
world, sources said at the time.
   The magazine Aviation Week and Space Technology reported in
January that the satellite is a ``combination'' spacecraft carrying
digital imaging cameras. It reported that the signal receivers
could intercept telephone, radio and secure television
transmissions in most populated areas of the Soviet Union.
   Sources said the satellite was launched at an inclination of 62
degrees, the farthest north ever for a shuttle mission. The 60th
parallel, a roughly corresponding measure on Earth, passes through
Leningrad, and most of the Soviet Union's population lies to the
south of Leningrad.
   According to NASA spokesman Charles R. Redmond, the phrase
``hardware elements'' has a number of meanings. ``It would almost
depend on the satellite,'' he said.
   For example, he said, space tracking stations could detect the
``shrouds'' that provide protection for appendages such as solar
panels, antennas or remote sensors until after the satellite is
launched from the shuttle.
   Redmond said it ``works to the advantage'' for reports of
malfunctioning satellites to be believed. He said that in past
instances of such reports, the military often has come back years
later with data only the satellite in question could have gathered.
   One intelligence official who the Post said was briefed on the
reported malfunction characterized it as a ``serious setback.'' A
member of Congress who was briefed said the incident is ``of major
concern ... but we're not crippled by this by any means.''
   One congressional source told The Associated Press that the U.S.
data-gathering capability has enough overlap to avoid any serious
information gap if the satellite is indeed useless.
   ``If you lost a couple in a row, you've got a much more serious
problem,'' the source said, adding that the more important role for
intelligence now is to keep track of demobilization rather than
possible threats.
   Another source disagreed, saying that unlike the Soviet Union,
the United States does not build ``redundancy'' into its overhead
surveillance system. So ``when you lose one you've got a hole,''
the source said.
   If the satellite is lost, there are others in that series, the
source said. The launch schedule could be speeded up, the source
said.
   The advances in satellite technology have led the United States
to retire its fleet of premier SR-71 spy planes, known as
``Blackbirds,'' which had been in use since 1964.
   Critics of that decision say the planes are more versatile than
satellites, which are locked into specific orbits. Satellites can
do similar work more cheaply, defenders of the decision say.
   If there is a malfunction, it would be the second reported
within a week. The Intelsat VI, a commercial communications
satellite, failed to separate from its launch vehicle after liftoff
from Cape Canaveral, Fla., last Wednesday.
   The Intelsat satellite had been trapped in a useless orbit that
drew it perilously close to Earth. But engineers on Friday managed
to shift the satellite's orbit enough so it is out of immediate
danger of burning up in the Earth's atmosphere.

<HEAD>Britain Welcomes U.S. Offer To Resettle Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain on Saturday welcomed a U.S. offer to
resettle half of all new Vietnamese refugees who qualify for asylum.
   The U.S. decision was announced Friday in London by Jewel S.
Lafontant, the State Department's coordinator for refugee affairs,
after two days of meetings aimed at reconciling differences with
Britain over Hong Kong's refugee problem.
   The United States and other countries criticized Britain for
forcibly returning 51 Vietnamese to Hanoi last year from Hong Kong.
Thousands of Vietnamese are held in refugee camps there after
arriving on boats.
   Britain had complained that those criticizing its refugee
policies should offer to take some of the Vietnamese to ease
overcrowding.
   Mrs. Lafontant said that for the current fiscal year, the United
States had allocated 25,000 admissions spaces to Indochinese
refugees from countries where they have gone for asylum and 26,500
spaces for refugees in the Orderly Departure Program. Under that
program, Vietnamese go directly to the United States from their
homeland.
   ``We will settle 50 percent of the new arrivals who are
determined to be refugees,'' she said. The United States also will
contribute $11.1 million to the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, she said. Britain has pledged $13 million, she said.
   Hundreds of thousands of Indochinese refugees fill squalid camps
throughout Southeast Asia.
   In the British colony of Hong Kong, more than 40,000 Vietnamese
took refuge during the last 18 months, swelling the number in camps
to 56,000. As the sailing season begins this month, thousands of
new arrivals are expected at camps there and in Malaysia, Thailand
and elsewhere.
   The Foreign Office said Saturday it welcomes ``any offers to
take refugees for resettlement.'' But government sources, speaking
on condition they not be identified, said the main problem is that
more than 90 percent of Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong do not
qualify as genuine refugees.
   To qualify, they must show they would be persecuted if they
returned home. British officials believe most want to leave Vietnam
for economic reasons.
   Britain favors mandatory return as a means of dissuading a new
influx of refugees to Hong Kong.
   ``It is the United States' strongly held view that no one be
sent back involuntarily,'' Mrs. Lafontant said.
   A 10-nation working group was set up to deal with the Vietnamese
refugees under the auspices of the U.N.-sponsored Comprehensive
Plan of Action. A meeting of the group broke down in January over
the issue of compulsory repatriation.
   Mrs. Lafontant said the United States was ``working hard to find
a consensus that will preserve first asylum, emphasize voluntary
repatriation, ensure fair screening procedures and provide adequate
protection for asylum seekers in Hong Kong and for those returned
to Vietnam.''
   ``Vietnam's neighbors have, on the whole, shown great
forebearance and generosity in affording first asylum to those
seeking it,'' she said, adding, ``The United States is doing its
part.''
   Mrs. Lafontant said the United States is asking other members of
the group to donate funds to help the U.N. refugee agency quickly
screen applicants waiting in camps.
   Since 1975, the United States has given asylum to more than
729,000 Indochinese. Australia has taken the second-largest number,
more than 121,000.

<HEAD>Test Reveals Leak in Propane Line</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CRESTED BUTTE, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators said Saturday they
have pinpointed a leak in a propane gas line near a bank wrecked by
an explosion that killed three employees and injured 14 people.
   The gas company Salgas and its parent, Empire Gas Inc., began
excavating a two-block section of line that was sealed off Tuesday
when high levels of propane were traced in the wreckage of the
Crested Butte State Bank.
   Authorities stressed they can't prove, and may never be able to
prove, whether the rupture found in the propane line caused the
blast, which leveled the bank in this western Colorado resort town
March 6.
   Fire Protection District Manager Mike Miller said the obvious
leak in the underground gas main was found Friday night between the
bank and an antiques store.
   ``Apparently, the pressurized air drove propane from the
saturated soils into the crawl space of the antiques store,''
Miller said. He said the occupants of three adjacent buildings have
been evacuated while the store's cellar is purged of residual gas.
   Local, state and federal investigators believe a gas caused the
explosion, but are unsure which gas is to blame. Naturally
occurring methane gas has been cited as a possible cause, although
no traces were found in the bank ruins or in holes bored 20 feet
into the ground in the explosion area.
   ``We're drawing no conclusions about what caused the bank
explosion,'' Miller said. ``Frankly, I'm uncertain whether anyone
can prove (the cause) definitively.''
   Workers Saturday found a ruptured coupling in the gas main about
two feet under, and one section of the pipe apparently had
completely separated from the coupling, Miller said. Fire Marshal
Rich Largo ordered the coupling and 4 feet of the gas main cut out
for further investigation.
   A metallurgist, possibly from the FBI, will examine the pipe to
determine if the coupling ruptured as a result of the explosion, or
if it was already broken when the blast occurred, Miller said.

<TEXT>
   Warsaw Pact foreign ministers,
reflecting the new diversity of an alliance once dominated by
Moscow, failed Saturday to agree whether a united Germany should be
neutral, disarmed or in NATO.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze stood alone in
ruling out NATO membership for a united Germany, said Czechoslovak
Foreign Ministry spokesman Lubos Dobrovsky.
   In comments to reporters, Shevardnadze stressed that ``the main
question concerning a united Germany is the level of armaments.
   ``We ministers are all unanimous on one point: that all states,
and not especially a united Germany, must be guided by the
principle of a defensive doctrine _ that is, to have that level of
armaments and armed forces necessary only for their own defense,''
Shevardnadze said.
   ``Some people say it's possible to keep (Germany) in the system
of NATO. We, for instance, think it's impossible,'' he said.
   The meeting on the eve of East Germany's first free elections
reflected the growing divergence of East European nations casting
off Stalinist models.
   Participants glossed over the differences, insisting the meeting
was intended to discuss German unity and its impact on Europe
rather than to agree on complex new designs for the security of the
world's most armed continent.
   Despite the acknowledged disagreements, some consensus emerged
that NATO and the Warsaw Pact, while outmoded, will exist for some
time, altered gradually by German unification and Eastern Europe's
dash to democracy.
   Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier, who with
President Vaclav Havel advocates dissolution of both alliances,
fleshed out that vision in a speech proposing a ``pan-European
security agreement'' policed by a new European Security Commission.
   The basis of the agreement should be that ``nobody can attack
anybody else'' and that all signatories agree to provide aid,
including military help, if any signatory does come under attack,
Dienstbier told the closed-door meeting. His speech was later given
to reporters.
   At a news conference, Dienstbier said the proposal was well
received but that the fluid situation in Europe made it impossible
to say when the 35 signatories of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act could
sign any new, binding security accord.
   The signatories are all European nations bar Albania, and the
United States, Canada and the Soviet Union.
   Discussing the security alternatives for a united Germany, some
nations said neutrality would be the worst alternative.
   The Soviet Union, by contrast, has suggested neutrality as one
way of allaying its traditional fears of Germany.
   ``Neutrality would isolate Germany and within a few years, this
would lead forward on a road which would not be good for Europe,''
Polish Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski told reporters. ``It
could further some trends in Germany to become a great power,
acting on its own.''
   Dienstbier pleaded for Germany to be deeply involved in European
organizations, saying: ``The more a state is integrated, the better
it can be controlled.''
   The history of all Warsaw Pact states is intertwined with
Germany's evolution over the centuries from a cluster of
principalities and dukedoms into a strong empire, then a Nazi
dictatorship, and now the potential 80-million strong superpower of
Europe.
   Poland has been particularly concerned by the discussion in West
Germany over the possible absorption of former German territories
now in western Poland.
   Poland will be included in the unification talks between the two
Germanies and four World War II allies when they discuss the border
issue.
   Havel and Dienstbier, drawing on philosophies they developed in
20 years of dissident opposition to the Communists, have
consistently argued for the burying of traditional enmities in a
new, bloc-free Europe.
   In his speech, Dienstbier stressed that the Germans should be
allowed to shape their own destiny, warning that ``attempts to
exercise pressure on this big nation may lead to the strengthening
of extremist political trends and groupings.''
   Stopping short of advocating total disarmament, Dienstbier
suggested that a united Germany reaffirm past declarations by both
Germanies never to acquire weapons of mass destruction.

   Here's a race where the victor can
become the spoils.
   ``Pest or pate, you decide,'' said James Pepper, coordinator of
the first Great Snail Festival. ``We're off and running, in a
manner of speaking.''
   The snail as both competitor and comestible will be feted during
the event Friday through Sunday in this community about 18 miles
east of Los Angeles.
   Pepper, 39, of Anaheim Hills, has booked the Sheraton Resort's
equestrian center for escargot experts, some who market
raspberry-flavored snail caviar and a trail mix made from dried
snails.
   Also on the agenda is a race to see which snail can climb a
13-inch pole the fastest, with a $500 first prize. If the snail
beats a 1988 record set in England of 2 minutes, 31 seconds, it
wins a $100 bonus for its owner.
   Prizes also will be awarded for the heaviest and best-dressed
snail. Snail-less activities include potato sack races for humans,
balloon toss contests and donkey races.
   Pepper reminds the health-conscious that snails _ as long as
they aren't doused in herb butter _ are low in caleries and high in
protein.
   By the way, did you know snails will keep in the refrigerator
for up to a month?

   The state's two large teachers unions
on Saturday urged striking teachers to end their 11-day-old walkout
after getting a pledge from legislative leaders to renew efforts to
help education.
   The tentative settlement, which contains no promise of more
money for the state's 22,000 teachers, came after House Speaker
Chuck Chambers and Senate President Keith Burdette, pledged to work
with Gov. Gaston Caperton and education representatives on a
long-term plan for the state's education system, officials said.
   The presidents of the 16,000-member West Virginia Education
Association and the 3,000-member West Virginia Federation of
Teachers announced the agreement Saturday afternoon.
   The walkout began March 7 and spread to all but a handful of the
state's 55 counties. Teachers had been threatened with mass firings
and court action if they continued the strike.
   ``We've moved education to the forefront, so it just isn't
asomething that you pay lip service to during elections,'' said
Kayetta Meadows, president of the WVEA, at a news conference.
   Talks between the legislative leaders and the teachers began
Thursday after Caperton said he would no longer negotiate with
teachers because they had rejected his third offer for ending the
walkout.
   Caperton has said the only way he can provide teacher pay raises
is to increase taxes, which he said the public opposes. The
teachers received a 5 percent pay raise earlier this year along
with other public employees.
   The teachers said they wanted more money and wanted lawmakers to
address their benefits packages.
   The state Legislature adjourned Thursday, passing a budget that
included no extra money for additional teacher pay raises. It did,
however, fully fund the state's insurance program and teachers
retirement system. It also provided $27 million to help balance
teacher pay from county to county.
   ``We will either continue to argue over what has happened to
public education in West Virginia or begin to agree on what is
needed to improve it,'' the lawmakers' joint statement announcing
the settlement said.
   The battle among teachers, lawmakers and Caperton had moved into
the state's courtrooms last week. Several circuit courts had ruled
the strikes illegal and ordered teachers back to the classroom.
   Teachers in Greenbrier and Jackson counties had voted to return
after local boards threatened to fire them and educators in other
counties had votes scheduled for the weekend before the tentative
agreement was announced.
   ``This proposal and pending legal action are the reasons for
WVFT's decision to ask teachers to end the strike and return to the
classroom,'' said Brown, whose group represents 3,000 teachers.
   ``Teachers should be proud of their solidarity. While none of it
was easy, we stood together in commitment to our principles,'' he
said. ``We walked out with dignity and in unity and we will return
with dignity and in unity.''
   The WVEA had rejected Caperton's offer of a 5 percent pay raise,
then rejected an offer for a special session, saying it was too
vague. But on Saturday, the lawmakers' promise to seek a special
session was accepted.
   The agreement announced Saturday also was short on details.
Meadows said no agenda has been set for the unions' meetings with
lawmakers and that no one has suggested how pay raises could be
funded.
   ``That is part of the plan that needs to be developed,'' Meadows
said. ``We haven't set the agenda.''
   The agreement apparently was reached without discussions with
the governor's office.
   ``If the result of the negotiations between Burdette and
Chambers is a more positive atmosphere, a more positive attitude on
the part of the teacher representatives, then we're all for it,''
said G.C. Morse, the governor's spokesman.
   ``It's reasonably consistent with what the governor has beeen
saying all along,'' Morse said. ``He was amenable to a special
session all along but largely objected to making commitments as a
result of threats.''

   A senior Iranian official said in an
interview published Sunday that prospects for release of the
Western hostages in Lebanon have never been better and that they
may be freed this year.
   Ali Mohammad Besharati, first deputy foreign minister, told the
Tehran Times newspaper, ``I can say that all the hostages may be
released by next January.''
   Besharati's statement was the latest in a series about the
hostages from ranking officials and the government-run media in
Tehran over the past month.
   The moderate faction led by President Hashemi Rafsanjani says
the hostage issue is moving toward a solution, while the radical
faction argues against releasing the captives.
   The 18 Western hostages are believed held by Shiite Moslem
groups more loyal to the radicals than the moderates. They include
eight Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an
Irishman and an Italian.
   The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who marked his fifth year
in captivity Friday. Most of the others have been held at least
three years.
   Besharati, who visited Lebanon recently, said he believes the
chances for a hostage release are better than ever.
   ``I saw the situation there. And you know nothing is secret in
Lebanon. On the basis of my observations I can say the chances for
freedom for the hostages are brighter than at any time before,'' he
said.
   He said he did not expect a mass release.
   ``My analysis of the situation is that all the hostages may not
be released at one time, but gradually,'' Besharati said.
   He stressed that Iran had no direct link to the kidnappings.
``The Islamic Republic of Iran, as it ha been repeatedly said, is
against the philosophy of hostage taking and Tehran has no direct
or indirect role in this matter,'' he said.
   An advance copy of the interview with the English-language daily
in Tehran was provided to The Associated Press. The same paper in
two recent editorials called for releasing the hostages as an
Islamic and humanitarian action.
   Iran finances Hezbollah, a Shiite Moslem militia. The radical
groups holding the hostages are believed linked to Hezbollah.
   The radical faction in Tehran, eager to confront Rafsanjani, has
encouraged the Lebanese groups to continue holding the hostages and
said Iran should stay out of the matter.
   Rafsanjani has voiced support for releasing the hostages several
times in the past, and the Tehran Times usually reflects his views.
   The moderate faction has sought improved ties with the West to
help finance Iran's reconstruction in the wake of the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war. But the radicals consider ties with the West a
betrayal of the ideals of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

<HEAD>Bungling By Germans Alleged Prior To Pan Am Bombing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   German authorities bungled and then tried to
cover up an investigation of a Palestinian terrorist group they
believe bombed Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland 15 months ago,
according to a new book.
   But the German operation, code-named ``Autumn Leaves,'' is
credited by authors Steven Emerson and Brian Duffy with arresting
16 people linked to the group two months before the bombing,
possibly stopping plans for even worse terrorist attacks.
   An explosion that investigators say originated in the luggage
compartment of the Boeing 747 airliner killed all 259 people on
board the Dec. 21, 1988, flight from London to New York and 11
people on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland.
   British investigators have concluded the bomb was made Semtex, a
plastic explosive, concealed in a radio-cassette player put aboard
another airliner that began Flight 103 in Frankfurt. But they have
filed no charges in the case.
   Emerson and Duffy's book, ``The Fall of Pan Am 103,'' published
by G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York, examines the bombing and its
investigation by U.S., British, German and other authorities.
Excerpts from the book appeared in Sunday's edition of The New York
Times Magazine.
   The authors say their conclusions are based on 250 interviews in
the United States, Europe and the Middle East. Many of their
findings have been reported in less detail by U.S. television
networks and European newspaper and magazine accounts.
   The book says investigators were convinced within days of the
crash that the bombing was carried out at the behest of Iran by the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command,
headed by Palestinian terrorist Ahmed Jibril.
   Prior to the bombing, all but two of the people linked to Jibril
in Germany had been released, including Marwa Khreesat, a man
previous reports have identified as the maker of bombs found by
German authorities.
   Emerson and Duffy's book says Khreesat may have been an
informant for German and Jordanian authorities and could also have
been a double or triple agent, reporting back to Jibril. German
intelligence officials have denied that Khreesat ever worked for
them.
   The Germans let the alleged terrorists go because they thought
they were not a threat to Germany and because they included their
own informants, the book says.
   German authorities also failed to find all of at least five
bombs Khreesat produced until several months after the bombing of
Flight 103, the book says. A German police officer was killed in
the dismantling of one bomb in April 1989.
   Until the officer's death, the Germans attempted to cover up
releasing members of Jibril's group by being uncooperative with
investigators from other countries looking into the bombing of
Flight 103, the book says.
   Investigators have linked the bomb aboard Flight 103 to one of
three alarm clocks purchased by accused terrorist Hafez Dalkimoni
before his October 1988 arrest in Germany, according to the book.
They also believe a suitcase seen by a witness in Khreesat's
possession may be the copper-colored suitcase that concealed the
bomb aboard Flight 103.
   Dalkimoni remains in custody, but Khreesat was released and, the
book says, is believed to be in Jordan.
   The book says American law enforcement and Israeli intelligence
officials believe the bombs built by Khreesat were intended to be
used for ``mass murder on a scale even more terrible than
Lockerbie.''
   It says authorities have no hard evidence but believe the intent
was to avenge the deaths of 290 people when a U.S. warship shot
down an Iranian Airbus over the Persian Gulf on July 3, 1988.
   ``That also leads to the conclusion that Autumn Leaves, for all
its evident failings, may have inadvertently saved several
hundreds, if not thousands, of lives,'' the book says.
   The authors also say Western intelligence officials have
reconstructed how the bomb was built, with Semtex smuggled from
Iran through an Iranian diplomatic pouch to a terrorist safehouse
in Yugoslavia.
   The barometric timers designed to trigger the bombs at a set
altitude were built near Damascus and smuggled to West Germany on
Syrian Airlines, the book says.
   Emerson is an investigative reporter for U.S. News &amp; World
Report. Duffy is an assistant managing editor for the magazine.

   President Bush reportedly has banned broccoli
from a diet known to include pork rinds doused in hot sauce and
candy bars crumbled over cereal.
   The March 26 issue of U.S. News &amp; World Report said Bush, an
avowed vegetable hater and junk-food junkie, decreed that broccoli
never be served on Air Force One.
   Bush, the report said, finally asserted himself after being
forced to put up with the vegetable during his eight years as vice
president.
   The no-broccoli edict raised at least one protest.
   ``What will parents tell Johnny when he refuses to eat his
broccoli or other vegetables?'' said Bob Carey of the Produce
Marketing Association, ``that the president doesn't know what's
good for him.?''

   Lithuania's president on Saturday rejected a
deadline set by Moscow for renouncing the republic's independence
and appealed to ``democratic nations'' to recognize the newly
declared state.
   President Vytautas Landsbergis made the appeal a day after
receiving a telegram from the Kremlin giving Lithuania until Monday
to renounce its self-proclaimed independence.
   In a terse telegram Friday, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
directed Landsbergis: ``In a three-day period, inform about
measures toward realizing this directive.''
   Lithuania declared its statehood restored last Sunday. The
Soviet Congress on Thursday charged Gorbachev with defending Soviet
interests and citizens in the Baltic republic of 3.7 million.
   It declared the Lithuanian move illegal and maintained the
Soviet Constitution was still valid there.
   A telexed message issued Saturday night by the Lithuanian
Supreme Council to Western media and embassies in Moscow indicated
the new leaders did not plan to comply.
   Addressed ``to the governments of democratic nations,'' it said
recognition of Lithuania's new status and government would be ``an
important sign of political and moral support.''
   ``This we kindly request,'' it concluded. It was signed by
Landsbergis.
   The new president also rejected the Moscow deadline in remarks
earlier Saturday, complaining that the Soviet Congress was treating
Lithuania ``like a naughty girl,'' according to Eduardas
Potashinskas, a Lithuanian TV editor.
   Landbergis also renewed his call for talks with the Kremlin. He
said perhaps the telegram could be interpreted as the beginning of
the negotiating process, and ``we remember Gorbachev's words about
a dialogue with Lithuania.''
   Gorbachev told a news conference Thursday night that he planned
to have ``a respectful dialogue'' with the republic's leaders and
people.
   He has not said what action he will take if Lithuania does not
respond within the three-day limit. However, the Soviet leader and
his advisers have ruled out the use of force to bring Lithuania
back into the union.
   Also at Saturday's session of the republic's legislature,
Algirdas Brazauskas, the republic's popular former president, was
elected to the post of deputy premier. A former Communist,
economist Kazimira Prunskene, was named premier.
   Brazauskas had rejected the offer of the post of deputy premier
last week, but he accepted the position after a vote of 122-3 in
his favor.
   Brazauskas has held talks with Gorbachev before and is
considered likely to play a prominent part in any negotiations.
   Landsbergis told the Supreme Council, the legislature, that
Gorbachev's telegram appeared to be meant to pressure the
leadership.
   ``It can only be remarked that it was sent to the wrong address
because we are no longer the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian
Soviet Socialist Republic,'' he was quoted as saying.
   When the republic declared its independence, its name was
officially changed to the Republic of Lithuania and the Supreme
Soviet legislature was renamed the Supreme Council.
   On Friday night, the Tass news agency quoted Landsbergis as
saying on television that Moscow had no right to tell Lithuania
what to do.
   ``It is not a problem that they do not recognize us now,'' Tass
quoted Landsbergis as saying. ``The time will come, and they will
recognize us.''

<HEAD>Concern Among East German Jews Grows Over Anti-Semitism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the eve of East Germany's first free
elections, many members of the country's small Jewish community
worried Saturday that the social upheaval of recent months will
revive anti-Semitism.
   ``The situation could become dangerous,'' said Nazi death camp
survivor Oljean Ingster, the 62-year-old cantor of the 200-member
Jewish community in East Berlin.
   ``With growing unemployment, we would expect attacks against
foreigners and Jews,'' said Ingster, speaking after Sabbath prayers
in the red brick Rykestrasse Synagogue in East Berlin's bohemian
Prenzlauer Berg district.
   East Berlin's Jewish population is only a fraction of what it
was before World War II, and only five congregation members came to
Saturday services in a small sideroom of the synagogue, which seats
2,000. It is the only of Berlin's 12 major Jewish houses of worship
to escape destruction by Nazi mobs.
   Ingster, wearing a black robe and velvet cap, led the service
with mournful chants of ancient Hebrew prayers, while a few of the
worshipers rocked back and forth in devotion. The three men had
covered their heads with skull caps worn by observant Jews, and
they had draped white fringed prayer shawls over their shoulders.
   But with only one day to go before the election, politics also
entered the house of worship when the congregation engaged in a
spontaneous debate before the service.
   ``Gysi is really not a bad guy, but unfortunately he belongs to
the wrong party,'' Ingster told a congregation member in the first
row as the two debated for whom to vote.
   Ingster was referring to Communist Party chief Gregor Gysi, who
is popular with many East Germans because of his refreshing wit.
The party, which ruled the country for 40 years, pledged democratic
renewal after last fall's popular revolt but is almost certain to
be an opposition party after the election.
   Other congregation members said the pace toward a united Germany
was much too fast.
   ``We don't know very much about the West, and we have an uneasy
feeling. German unity will only create chaos,'' said Gertrud Adam,
a slight woman in her 40s. She said she considered East Germany her
home and didn't want the country to be forced into unconditional
surrender to West Germany.
   Ingster and others said that while they welcomed the new
political freedom, they were worried by the growing nationalistic
sentiments and the emergence of right-wing extremist groups. In
several pro-democracy marches in recent months, roving bands of
neo-Nazi skinheads have attacked leftist demonstrators.
   Ingster said that under Communist leadership, he had encountered
only isolated incidents of anti-Semitism. In general, the Communist
leaders tried to keep a tight lid on anti-Semitic outbursts,
arguing that the ``new man'' created under socialism was incapable
of bigotry, Ingster said.
   Throughout the Communist years, East Berlin's Jewish
congregation kept a low profile and the regime did not interfere
with religious practices, Ingster said.
   At the same time, the Communists did not offer support to revive
Jewish culture in Berlin. Before the Nazis came to power in 1933,
Berlin was a thriving center of Jewish life with about 170,000
Jewish residents.
   Today, an estimated 2,500 Jews live in East Berlin, including
about 200 formally registered congregation members. Ingster said
that many of the congregation members were Holocaust survivors who
returned after World War II because they couldn't bear life in
exile. The East Berlin congregation has not had a full-time rabbi
since 1965.
   An estimated 6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis during the
Holocaust.
   Ingster, who spent four years in Sachsenhausen and other death
camps, said he stayed on because he was exhausted. ``I needed time
to catch my breath. And then I realized I should stay to preserve
what was left of the Jewish congregation,'' he said.

   A policeman shot and killed an escaped
drug importer who was No. 3 on U.S. marshals' most-wanted list
after the fugitive fired at the officer during a routine traffic
stop, police said.
   Douglas Alan Costa, 45, slipped federal custody in San Francisco
in 1987 while serving a 45-year sentence in Texarkana, Texas, for
importing marijuana.
   Police said Officer Anthony Duckworth stopped a car early Friday
for having a broken taillight, talked with the driver and returned
to his patrol car to write a citation.
   Costa, who was traveling alone, then got out of his car, walked
toward the patrol car and fired a single shot at Duckworth with a
small-caliber handgun, said police spokeswoman Sgt. Sandy Cortez.
Duckworth fired back, hitting Costa several times, she said.
   The policeman escaped injury. It was not known if he knew Costa
was wanted.
   Police said they found $15,000 in cash and an unspecified amount
of narcotics in the car.
   Duckworth will be placed on routine administrative leave while
the police and the Alameda County district attorney's office
investigate the shooting.
   Costa was serving a sentence in Texas when he was brought to San
Francisco to face charges there, said Dennis Berry, a U.S.
marshal's inspector.
   While in custody, a detention order was overlooked and a judge
lowered Costa's bail from $2 million to $100,000, Berry said. Costa
arranged for the bail to be paid and walked free, he said.
   Authorities had considered him armed and dangerous, saying he
threatened to kill a federal judge, a leading Drug Enforcement
Administration inspector and several witnesses who testified
against him during his Texas trial.

   President Vaclav Havel of
Czechoslovakia and Poland's Solidarity leader Lech Walesa met in
the mountains on their nations' border Saturday and pledged to work
for European unity.
   It was their first meeting and the locale is where the
opposition of both countries forged friendship during the years of
Communist rule.
   Hundreds of Czechoslovak and Polish tourists swarmed around the
helicopters that brought Havel and Walesa to the top of Sniezka
Mountain for an afternoon of meetings organized by activists from
both sides.
   Some now are members of the governments that took over when
Communists in Poland and Czechoslovakia were swept from power.
   ``It is a good thing that these two men finally meet,'' said
Bronislaw Geremek, a Polish historian and leader of the Solidarity
caucus in parliament.
   Polish and Czechoslovak flags decorated tourist hotels on both
sides of the border where the meetings were held.
   ``Today's meeting on our common border is no accident. This way
we want to refer to the traditions of many years when Poles,
Czechs, and Slovaks, often deprived of contacts, used to meet here
in the mountains in order to exchange experiences,'' said a joint
communique issued after the meeting.
   It called on the nations to ``coordinate our strivings not only
for democracy and order in our countries but also for our return to
Europe as a friendly union of free nations and democratic
indepedent countries.''
   Cooperation to reverse ecological damage from decades of
industrial pollution and ways to deepen democracy also were among
the issues Walesa and Havel discussed.
   The two did not meet when Havel visited Poland in January, and
the meeting was organized to allow the men to exchange views on the
future of Europe.
   Walesa called the talks ``very fruitful'' and Havel said he
found the Solidarity leader a ``nice and friendly guy.''
   Members of the Czechoslovak human rights movement Charter 77 and
the Polish Committee for the Defense of Workers began meeting in
the mountains along the border during the late 1970s.
   Those meetings were interrupted by the 1981 martial law that
crushed Solidarity and landed many of the Polish participants in
jail. At the same time, Havel and other Czechoslovak activists also
were serving time for political activities.
   The Polish border guards' behavior had changed a lot from those
days, when they did their best to prevent the two sides from coming
together. One captain Saturday presented the Polish participants
with badges giving them honorary membership in the border guards.
   They also indirectly addressed the issue of German reunification
by calling for a commitment to existing borders of Europe.
   Poland has been seeking guarantees that once the German states
unify, the nation will respect the western border of Poland and not
try to regain territory ceded to Poland after World War II.
   Havel offered a clear vision of how he perceived the ``return to
Europe'' of countries repressed by postwar totalitarianism.
   ``This unity should be characterized by the fact that smaller
nations will not be afraid of bigger nations anymore and the big
nations will not have to rival each other,'' he told a news
conference in a hotel on the Polish side of the border.
   He said he saw Europe ``as a part of the world where unity and
differences prevail _ as a continent which will not give the world
wars, but as a continent which will give the world peace.''
   Havel and Walesa also called for the ``full respect for the
right of all nations to self-determination, including
reconstruction of statehood.''
   They were referring to republics in the Soviet Union which are
trying to win independence from Moscow.

<HEAD>Opera-Bastille Makes Debut With `The Trojans'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Paris' new high-tech Opera-Bastille underwent what
critics called a ``baptism by fire'' during its operatic debut
Saturday, a six-hour performance of Hector Berlioz's ``The
Trojans.''
   The French music world eagerly awaited the show as an ambitious
and demanding test of the state-of-the-art building. The massive
glass-and-steel structure, shaped like an ocean liner, overlooks
the capital's Place de la Bastille.
   Stages, curtains, podiums and other gadgetry are run by 225
control drives and three computers. Using the computers, stage
hands are able to change scenery by remote control, and lighting
can be programmed into the computer during rehearsals.
   South Korean-born Myung-Whun Chung, 37, is conducting the opera
house's first production. The cast features four Americans: Shirley
Verrett, Grace Bumbry, Gary Bachlund and George Gray.
   The set design and costumes are the work of Italian veteran
Pier-Luigi Pizzi, who has erected a giant Trojan horse outside the
opera house.
   The building, designed by Canada's Carlos Ott, was inaugurated
in July with a gala concert. At that time, it drew mixed reviews
for what some critics called its ``metallic'' acoustics.
   Some people close to the production say the first season should
have been postponed another year so technicians could master the
sophisticated equipment.
   In an article before opening night, the Le Monde daily called
the Opera-Bastille ``a promising prototype delivered before
trials.'' It said it would become the ``technical marvel it was
supposed to be in 10 years.''
   Chung, in comments before opening night, called ``The Trojans''
an extremely difficult work.
   ``The only hope that I expressed to the musicians is that I hope
we can be successful enough to be able to go on,'' he told Le Monde.
   Chung was named artistic and musical director last spring after
Daniel Barenboim was fired in a policy dispute.
   According to President Francois Mitterrand, who launched the
project, the new house was made ``modern and popular'' so opera
would be more accessible to the masses. Opening night tickets cost
between $6.50 and $60 _ half the price at the old Palais Garnier,
now used only for ballet.
   Unlike the ornate and obsolete Garnier, which had 400 seats with
obstructed views, the 2,700 seats in the Opera-Bastille's main
auditorium have clear views of the stage.
   The auditorium _ a sleek design in black, white and oak paneled
walls _ contains two steep balconies. It has seats with holes to
let the sound pass through and an orchestra pit that can be lowered
out of sight and covered.
   ``The Trojans'' has never been performed in Paris in its
entirety.
   Critics said reviving the work of Berlioz, a 19th century French
composer, was a good idea because he has been received better
aboard than in his homeland.
   A full-length version of ``The Trojans'' was performed for the
first time in French at London's Covent Garden in 1969 under the
direction of British maestro Colin Davis.
   ``Colin Davis told me that it almost killed him,'' Chung said.
``I thanked him for passing me the torch.''

   Former President Jimmy Carter urged Arab
leaders Saturday to reconsider the 1979 Camp David peace accord
between Israel and Egypt to reach a settlement in the Arab-Israeli
dispute.
   Carter also said Soviet Jewish immigration to the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip would be ``an impediment
to peace,'' and expressed hope that a new government in Israel will
lead to Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
   The government-run Sawt Ash-Shaab newspaper described Carter's
visit to the Middle East as a ``waste of time.''
   But Carter declared: ``If you go back now and re-examine the
Camp David agreement, you would see that it provides a framework
for peace.''
   His comments were made during an informal meeting with members
of Jordan's parliament.
   Carter, who brokered the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian treaty, said: ``I
don't maintain that the Camp David accord is a perfect document,
but it can obviously be a binding document.''
   He noted that the Israeli parliament had approved the Camp David
accord, which includes the recognition of a U.N. resolution calling
for Israeli withdrawal from the areas captured in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   ``This was the first time Israel ever approved Resolution 242,''
he said.
   That resolution also calls for the right of all parties,
including Israel, to live in peace within secure borders.
   The accord led to Egypt becoming the only Arab country to have a
peace treaty with Israel.
   Carter said Arab leaders could select ``the parts they want from
the agreement in light of the present-day circumstances.''
   Israel continues to occupy the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
more than 600 Palestinians have died since an uprising against
Israeli rule began in December 1987.
   Commenting on Arab concerns over Soviet Jewish immigration to
Israel and the occupied zones, Carter said: ``I share this concern
with you.
   ``To the extent that Israeli officials are using the Soviet
Jewish immigration to populate the occupied territories, it is
indeed counterproductive, an impediment to peace and an unexcusable
exploitation of the Soviet Jews who deserve support and peaceful
existance and an opportunity to be free,'' he said.
   Israeli leaders are expecting thousands of Soviet Jews to arrive
in their country, largely because of Moscow's easing of emigration
rules.
   Israeli officials have repeatedly denied there is a government
policy of settling Soviet Jews in the occupied lands and say only
about 200 of 12,000 Soviet Jews who arrived last year settled in
the territories.
   Nevertheless, the issue has alarmed Arabs, who fear they may be
pushed out to make room for the new arrivals.
   Representatives of nine members of the Organization of Islamic
Conference met Saturday in Saudi Arabia to discuss measures to
counter the mass emigration.
   The group's secretary-general, Hamid al-Gabid, said the influx
of Soviet Jews will ``create major upheavals in the region, change
its demography, undermine Palestinian rights, lead to the
confiscation of more Palestinian land, the setting up of more
settlements and strengthen the Israeli military apparatus.''
   Carter said Soviet officials recently assured him Moscow was
``contemplating a change in the Soviet law'' to persuade Jews to
remain in the Soviet Union.
   This includes allowing the return of hundreds of thousands of
Soviet Jews who emigrate, and allowing more religious and cultural
freedom for Jews, Carter said.
   He spoke out in favor of convening an international peace
conference on the Middle East after the Arabs and Israel ``reach an
adequate and mutual trust.''
   Commenting on the fall of hard-line Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's government, and efforts to form a new
administration led by rival Labor Party leader Shimon Peres, Carter
said: ``Mr. Shamir has never been ready to sit and talk to
Palestinians.
   ``Labor are ready ... to advocate that a decision has to be made
to begin talks with the Palestinians,'' he added.
   Shamir lost a vote of no-confidence in parliament last week over
his refusal to accept compromises to get preliminary peace talks
under way.
   Carter and his wife, Rosalyn, flew in from Syria on Friday. He
will visit Israel and the occupied territories Sunday.
   The visit tothe region is Carter's fourth since he left office
in 1981.

<HEAD>OPEC Ministers Agree to Hold Down Production</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC ministers Saturday renewed their
efforts to keep crude oil prices up and their membership in line by
agreeing to hold down production.
   The ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries wound up six hours of talks by renewing support for a
target price of $18 a barrel.
   They also reaffirmed an earlier decision to carry into the
April-June quarter their production ceiling of just more than 22
million barrels a day. The cap was set in November for the first
six months of the year.
   However, the 13-nation cartel has been pumping up to 23.7
million barrels a day, according to analysts. The overproducers
include Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
   To meet the cap, some of the countries would have to cut
production.
   ``We expect that we will withdraw some quantities from the
market'' during the coming months, said Mines Minister Sadek
Boussena of Algeria. He was president of the meeting in Vienna,
where OPEC has its headquarters.
   ``This at least could avoid a decrease in the prices and stop
the movement we noticed'' in recent weeks, he told reporters.
   The average price reached $20.56 a barrel in the first week of
January, topping the $18 target, Opec reports. Since then, the
price has been slipping, down in the second week of March to $17.91
a barrel.
   Most expect the price to fall further in the second quarter of
the year. Demand for the cartel's oil usually contracts with the
warming weather in the United States and other consuming nations.
   An OPEC report predicted demand would slump in the April-June
period to 20.8 million barrels a day before rebounding to 21.4
million in the third quarter.
   Boussena said that if the countries abide by the stated
ceilings, ``prices will be at an acceptable level.'' Iraq's Issam
Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi predicted that prices will stay about $18.
   West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, usually
runs several dollars above the OPEC average. It has been trading
between $20 and $21 a barrel in recent weeks.
   It was unclear what effect the cartel's latest decision would
have on production.
   The United Arab Emirates will likely continue pumping about 2
million barrels a day, double its quota. The Emirates did not sign
the November agreement setting the current production ceiling.
   Oil Minister Ali Khalifa al-Sabah of Kuwait has reportedly said
his country does not have to abide by its quota when prices are
above $18.
   Boussena insisted all OPEC countries except the United Arab
Emirates would follow their supply limits. ``They reaffirmed
without any exception,'' he said.

<HEAD>Fighting Surges Between Christian Forces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shell ignited a fire in an underground
shelter north of Beirut on Saturday, killing four members of a
family during escalating battles between Christian forces, police
said.
   Eight civilians also were wounded in mortar battles between
renegade Gen. Michel Aoun's troops and the Lebanese Forces
militiamen of warlord Samir Geagea in Kesrouan province, police
said.
   The four killed were a Christian man, his wife and two
daughters. They were trapped in a burning shelter in the town of
Ballouneh, 20 miles north of Beirut.
   Saturday's toll was the heaviest since neutral Christians
negotiated a cease-fire March 3. Despite the truce, mediators have
failed to make progress toward a political settlement and there
have been repeated clashes.
   The casualties raised the overall toll to 762 killed and 2,115
wounded from more than six weeks of fighting for control of the
Lebanons' 310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   It is the worst Christian fighting since Lebanon's civil war
broke out 15 years ago. Most fighting has pitted Moslems and
Christians.
   Aoun, who had been appointed head of a caretaker Christian
Cabinet, has refused to recognize the government of President Elias
Hrawi. It was formed in November to carry out a peace treaty
brokered by the Arab League countries to end the civil war, which
has claimed more that 150,000 lives.
   The Christian general, however, rejected the peace plan, saying
it should have set a specific timetable for a complete pullout of
Syrian troops from Lebanon. The Syrians, who sent troops under a
1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate, now control most of the
country.
   Aoun fought a round of battles last year with Syrian-backed
Moslem militias before taking on Geagea's Christian forces this
year.

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sun smiled on the Irish Saturday and
a crowd of 350,000 lined Dublin's most famous thoroughfare,
O'Connell Street, for the biggest-ever St. Patrick's Day parade.
   Skies were clear and temperatures were in the high 50s, a
perfect combination for the annual parade. This year it included
more than 100 bands and had a European Community theme to mark the
current Irish presidency of the 12-nation Common Market.
   Children wore the costumes and carried the flags of the
different member states.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey, the EC president, and his son
Sean, the lord mayor of Dublin, reviewed the parade from a stand
outside the General Post Office, the focal point of the 1916 Easter
uprising against the British.
   President Patrick Hillery received greetings from abroad,
including messages from President Bush, Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev and Pope John Paul II.
   Aer Lingus, the national airlines, said it expected to fly
58,000 passengers in and out of the country over the long weekend
and 5,000 were expected to arrive on trans-Atlantic flights.
   Dublin Tourism organized the parade and said 6,000 people took
part, the largest number ever, including groups from the United
States, Estonia, France and West Germany. A spokesman, speaking on
condition he was not identified, estimated that 350,000 spectators
had lined the route.
   Bord Failte, the Irish tourist board, said about 3,000 tourists
came to the city for the event.
   Speaking on television as he reviewed the parade, Haughey said:
``I am looking forward to Ireland in the '90s.
   ``I see Ireland as a part of a prosperous Europe and playing its
full role as a part of an expanding European Community. And my wish
for Ireland would certainly be to have the people of Ireland united
in a united Europe.''
   Irish television broadcast the parade live and it was also
transmitted to 31 stations across the United States including New
York, Chicago, San Francisco, Washington, Dallas, Pittsburg, Miami,
Denver, Milwaukee and Atlanta.
   Most workers will have Monday off, an extra day to celebrate
because St. Partrick's day fell on a Saturday.

<HEAD>Vatican Newspaper Urges Support for Gorbachev Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican newspaper urged greater
international support Saturday for Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, one of its most direct endorsements ever of his reforms.
   In a front-page editorial, L'Osservatore Romano said ``the
current phase of the complex Soviet perestroika ... must be looked
upon with a sympathetic eye, particularly for the people and
nations involved.''
   Perestroika is Gorbachev's program to restructure the Soviet
economy and society.
   The newspaper said the creation of a presidential-republic form
of government was a delicate task.
   ``The presidential republic, approved after great effort and for
the moment more sketchy than definite in the necessary balances of
power, cannot however be summarily equated with a dictatorial and
neo-Stalinist disguise,'' the editorial said.
   Gorbachev was elected president of the Soviet Union on Thursday,
a day after the Congress of People's Deputies approved his plan for
a presidency with vast new powers.
   Some Soviet progressives and observers from other countries have
criticized the new system as giving Gorbachev dictatorial powers.
   The Osservatore Romano editorial said that ``every historical
event, and therefore also the one in the USSR, develops its
distinctive signs in its own rhythm and its own ways ... all
together, the last five years offer the image of a big wall that
has been demolished by healthy blows.''
   The editorial came two days after the Vatican and the Soviet
Union established diplomatic ties for the first time since the
founding of the Communist state.

   Widespread flooding was reported in the South on Saturday, and
rain showers extended over New England and into New York, where St.
Patrick's Day paradegoers were drenched.
   Rain also fell in Florida and along the northern Pacific Coast,
while snow fell in the Midwest and West.
   Thunderstorm winds gusted to 52 mph at Baltimore, the National
Weather Service said.
   Early morning flooding in North Carolina forced the closing of
several roads. Clemson, S.C., reported a little more than 5 inches
of rain since Friday morning.
   The worst flooding was in southern Alabama, where at least 1,000
people were evacuated when a levee broke, flooding downtown streets
and inundating homes. Rescuers in boats plucked people from
rooftops and trees.
   A dam on the Kinchafoonee Creek, north of Preston, Ga., burst
during the morning, and water was rising about 6 inches an hour
downstream from the dam.
   Nearly a foot of water covered the streets in the Tennessee
towns of Copperhill and Ducktown, and flooding was reported at
McCaysville, Ga.
   Homes in low-lying areas in all three towns were being evacuated.
   Elsewhere across the South, most of western Georgia was under
flood warnings although rain had finally tapered off after a
two-day deluge. In Mississippi, about 35 homes were flooded in
Jackson County and several roads were washed out after 14 inches of
rain fell in two days, officials reported.
   Snow was falling across Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, the
panhandle of Nebraska, Wyoming and Montana.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 26
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 91 degrees at Melbourne, Fla.
   The nation's low was 9 degrees at Alamosa and Gunnison, Colo.

<TEXT>
   Judges subpoenaed Italy's anti-Mafia commissioner on
accusations he broke the law by overstepping his powers, newspapers
and state-owned television reported Saturday.
   The reports prompted an uproar, and some politicians charged the
move was aimed only at thwarting the work of Anti-Mafia
Commissioner Domenico Sica, one of the country's most prominent
investigators of terrorism and organized crime.
   The subpoena, issued last week by a Rome court but only reported
Saturday, is the latest in a series of blows against Sica, some by
the powerful national judges' board.
   The subpoena accuses Sica of overstepping his powers and
violating the rules of secrecy for investigations. The commissioner
could be put on trial if a further investigation produces enough
evidence.
   If found guilty, he could be sentenced to five years in jail.
   The charges are linked to an investigation last summer into a
series of anonymous letters sent to Italian politicians alleging
that top judicial investigators abetted Mafia figures who turned
state's evidence.
   Newspapers reported that during the investigation, Sica obtained
the fingerprint of a judge suspected of writing the letters by
giving him a drink and then having the print removed from the glass.
   The subpoena charges that Sica did not have the police powers
required to take the fingerprint, the newspaper and television
reports said. The subpoena also reportedly says Sica violated
secrecy regulations by discussing the investigation with
politicians.
   No comment was available immediately from Sica, who was
appointed in August 1988 to revive the state's fight against
organized crime.
   Some politicians criticized the subpoena as an effort to
diminish the commissioner's powers.
   ``I believe that, in general, there is an obvious maneuver to
destabilize the office of anti-Mafia commissioner,'' said Paolo
Ungari, a leader of the Republican party, part of the five-party
coalition governing Italy.
   Carlo Donat Cattin, the health minister and a member of the
dominant Christian Democrats, said the case reflected ``a war among
Mafias of magistrates more than a war against the Mafia.''
   But some other politicians said the case illustrated that judges
were overstepping their authority in their investigations of the
Mafia. In Italy, judges have traditionally done a large amount of
the investigative work in criminal cases.
   The subpoena of Sica was the latest setback for Italy's fight
against organized crime, a battle that has been mired in scandals
since the conviction of 338 people in a major organized crime trial
in 1987.
   Early this month, a judge caused a furor by telling a television
interviewer that he and two colleagues had been removed from Sica's
office because the commissioner was ``about to arrive at the attic
of the skyscraper of the Mafia'' _ in other words, top politicians
linked to the mob.
   Italy's national judges' board, the Superior Council of
Magistrates, rejected the charges. It said it removed the three
assistants last February because Sica had been assigned detective
rather than judicial jobs.
   The episode came after a leading judge criticized Sica for
ordering the tapping of hundreds of telephones, a practice rarely
allowed by Italian law.
   During his judicial career, Sica has investigated most of
Italy's major terrorism cases, ranging from the kidnapping and
killing of former Premier Aldo Moro in 1978 to the 1981 shooting of
Pope John Paul II.
   He also worked on organized crime investigations including one
into the ``Pizza Connection'' heroin-trafficking ring controlled by
Italian Mafia and U.S. mob figures who operated in the Northeastern
and Midwestern United States.

<HEAD>Woman Said to be Drug Cult `Priestess' Says She Was Not Involved
in Slayings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who investigators say was the high
priestess of a Mexican drug cult that sacrificed 15 people last
spring says she had nothing to do with the deaths and that police
have tortured her.
   Sara Aldrete Villarreal, 25, is also accused of ordering the May
6 slayings of 26-year-old Cuban-American Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo,
the alleged ``godfather'' of the cult, and his bodyguard as police
closed in on their hideout.
   Authorities say Constanzo had overseen the ritual killings of
the 15 men and boys, including a University of Texas student, at a
ranch outside Matamoros in April, telling his followers the deaths
would give them spiritual protection from police.
   Police say Ms. Aldrete took part in at least one of the ritual
killings, selecting the victim and supervising his murder.
   ``It's not true, it's just not true and I'm fed up with saying
it,'' Ms. Aldrete said in a recent interview with the Dallas Times
Herald in Mexico City.
   She said Mexican police tortured her immediately after her
capture, poking her with electric prods and hanging her from
ceiling pipes by her handcuffed wrists, Ms. Aldrete said.
   She said she was also taken to the morgue where autopsies were
being performed on Constanzo and Martin Quintana, his bodyguard.
Police forced her to touch the eviscerated bodies, she said.
   ``They said, `OK, here is your god.' And they said, `Get up,
God. Aren't you going to help Sara?''' Ms. Aldrete told the
newspaper.
   Because Mexican law requires that a judge rule on the case
within a year of the suspect's arrest, a ruling in the Constanzo
murder case is expected before mid-May. Ms. Aldrete faces a
possible 40-year maximum sentence on a murder charge.
   Under the Mexican judicial system, the accused is guilty until
proven innocent. The trial is an administrative process that allows
a judge to review evidence presented by defense attorneys and
prosecutors.
   In addition to the possible 40-year prison term, Ms. Aldrete
could be charged in Matamoros and extradited to the United States
to face related charges in the ritual slayings.
   Ms. Aldrete told the newspaper she met Constanzo in Matamoros in
August 1987. They began a romantic relationship that ended several
months later when Constanzo told her about the male lovers he also
had.
   ``I knew that Adolfo was a white witch,'' Ms. Aldrete said. ``I
used to respect his religion and he used to respect mine,'' which
she said was Roman Catholicism.
   ``At the beginning he was a good guy who cared about people. But
then he changed and he was no longer the man I used to know. He was
out of control.''
   Ms. Aldrete claims Constanzo kidnapped her in March and fled
Matamoros just before the bodies were discovered in early April.
She said she was sometimes bound and gagged during the month
Constanzo and his gang hid in and around Mexico City.
   But police maintain Ms. Aldrete, at Constanzo's request, ordered
gang member Alvaro de Leon to kill Constanzo and his bodyguard at a
Mexico City apartment.
   Ms. Aldrete claims police killed the two men. She also says she
wrote the note that led police to Constanzo's hideout.

   Contra rebels attacked soldiers
southeast of Managua and three guerrillas were killed, the
government said Saturday.
   The report came the day after a U.S. government source said some
rebels had slipped back into Nicaragua. The exact number is not
known, but U.S. officials believe the number of rebels inside
Nicaragua has grown from 3,500 to 5,000.
   The U.S.-backed rebels have resisted calls from President Daniel
Ortega and President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro to disband
before the April 25 inauguration. Ortega, who was voted out of
office Feb. 25, leads the leftist Sandinista government that the
Contras have fought to overthrow.
   In its statement Saturday, the Defense Ministry said the latest
fighting came Friday when the rebels attacked Sandinista army
troops at El Ojoche hill in Rio San Juan province, 180 miles
southeast of Managua.
   A source in Juigalpa, the main city in the region, said Hilario
Salomon Velasquez Romero, a rebel chief, was one of the three
killed.
   Fighting the past week also was reported north of Santo Domingo
in Chontales province, killing 15 Contras and wounding several
Sandinista soldiers.
   Other battles around Jinotega, 118 miles north of Managua, ended
Friday when the rebels withdrew, the government newspaper Barricada
said Saturday.
   About 11,000 Contra rebels had been living in camps across the
border in Honduras. Authority for new U.S. aid to the Contras has
expired, but the U.S. Agency for International Development is
providing food money for 3,500 people from cash already available,
the U.S. government source said.

<HEAD>Results of Inquiry Into AIDS Virus Discovery Never Got Published</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf to clarify that inquiry concluded Gallo only
may have discovered offspring of French virus.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A secret government inquiry into the research of
America's leading AIDS scientist uncovered evidence that he was not
the first to discover the deadly virus, as the United States has
claimed, a newspaper reported.
   But an internal report issued by the National Cancer Institute
after the inquiry failed to mention the evidence and concluded that
the institute's Dr. Robert C. Gallo was the first to discover the
AIDS virus, the Chicago Tribune reported in its Sunday editions.
   As a result of the omission, legal briefs filed by the
government in the U.S. Court of Claims and before the Patent and
Trademark Office contained repeated misstatements of fact about
Gallo's research, the Tribune said.
   The secret inquiry, conducted by National Institutes of Health,
concluded that instead of discovering the AIDS virus, Gallo may
have discovered the offspring of a sample virus sent to him by
French scientists, the newspaper reported.
   The National Cancer Institute is part of NIH, which is run by
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
   The 10-page internal report was prepared in late 1985 by a
senior institute official for use in defending the government
against legal actions by the French, the newspaper reported. It was
signed by Dr. Peter J. Fischinger, then associate director of the
cancer institute, and submitted to Health and Human Services
officials, the Tribune said.
   The Tribune said it obtained Fischinger's report and the other
documents from an unnamed source. Fischinger, Gallo and the U.S.
Justice Department either didn't answer requests for interviews or
declined to be interviewed, the newspaper said.
   Previously Gallo said of the inquiry, ``I have done nothing
wrong and I have no apprehension or anxiety about the review.''
   Gallo and his colleagues were once considered independent
co-discoverers of the AIDS virus along with Drs. Luc Montagnier,
Jean-Claude Chermann and others at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.
   The French were first to publish information about their virus,
which they called LAV, in May 1983, but the finding was largely
ignored because it was from one isolated case of an AIDS-related
disease.
   The Gallo group maintained it was the first to isolate, study in
detail, classify and definitely link a similar virus, called
HTLV-3, with AIDS. This work was published in four papers in the
May 4, 1984, issue of the journal Science.
   The French later charged that Gallo and his assistants, by
accident or design, had claimed the French virus as their own.
   The French institute sued the U.S. government in December 1985
claiming it wrongly granted Americans the patent on a test to
detect AIDS antibodies. The French said they had developed the test
first and first applied to patent it.
   The U.S. government in March 1987 settled out of court with the
French. Both sides agreed that the Pasteur Institute has the right
to sell its AIDS test in this country and that the two sides would
share royalties from the U.S. AIDS test.
   Fischinger's report, along with other documents obtained by the
Tribune, indicates that dozens of legal claims by the U.S.
government were unsupported by Gallo's lab records. They included:
   _ That genetic evidence ``conclusively'' established that the
Gallo AIDS virus was an independent isolate and not the same virus
the French had sent him.
   _ That Gallo had actually discovered the virus a month before
French researchers at the Pasteur Institute but had withheld news
of the discovery for more than a year.
   _ That because Gallo's lab was the first to develop a blood test
that could detect infections with the AIDS virus, the lucrative
patent on the test belonged to the U.S. government and not the
French.

   A six-month undercover investigation
resulted in the seizure of 2,200 pounds of cocaine in California
and Central America and the arrests of nine people linked to
Colombia's Medellin cartel, authorities said.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration said a Central American
country it would not identify helped confiscate 1,210 pounds of
cocaine bound for San Francisco on Friday. Authorities in the same
operation seized 990 pounds of cocaine 13 days earlier.
   The Central American country cannot be named for fear of
jeopardizing future operations there, said agent Robert Bender. He
estimated the street value of the confiscated cocaine at $100
million.
   ``These are significant players in the (Medellin) organization
... they were looking to expand their market, and they were looking
heavily at the San Francisco Bay area,'' Bender said.
   He said the undercover operation started last fall, when drug
enforcement agents met Juan Merino Noriega, 32, of Peru on a San
Francisco street and convinced him they could transport and
distribute large quantities of drugs.
   On March 3, undercover agents promising to pay $5 million lured
the first shipment from Peru to a Central American landing strip,
where the drugs were loaded onto a plane ``controlled'' by the DEA
and flown to Howard Air Base in Panama, Bender said.
   Unknown to the traffickers, the cocaine was transferred to a
U.S. military aircraft and flown to Moffett Field south of San
Francisco, he said. Agents loaded the drugs into a rented truck,
drove it to San Francisco and showed the goods to Noriega to
convince him they were capable of importing large amounts of
cocaine.
   Those arrested face federal charges of conspiracy to import the
drug, agents said. Penalties range from 10 years to life in prison
and fines up to $4 million.
   Agents arrested five people at a hotel near San Francisco
International Airport, Bender said. Besides Noriega, they were
identified as Jamie Uribe, 68, of Colombia; Carlos Guerriero, 36,
of Colombia; Frank Emilio dela Campa, 34, of Cuba; and David Edward
Villegas, 39, a U.S. citizen whose hometown was not given.
   Rosanna Patricia Targler, 26, of Peru, was arrested in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., and three unidentified suspects from Colombia
were seized with a twin-engine plane in Central America, Bender
said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Lyons said the United States is
seeking to extradite several suspects still in Central America. He
gave no details.

   The country's oldest and largest St. Patrick's
Day parade headed up Fifth Avenue on Saturday amid the strains of
bagpipes, a sea of green and, eventually, a torrential downpour.
   But the rain didn't dampen spirits as hundreds of thousands of
people turned out, most sporting something green, whether it was a
green moustache, ``Irish Eyes'' glasses with green lenses or
leprechaun hats, complete with pointed ears.
   ``I've seen Disneyworld and Disneyland,'' said Bridget Powderly,
an Irish-born Londoner in town specifically for the parade. ``This
is better.''
   The National Weather Service had predicted the rain could hold
off until evening, but called it a ``close race.''
   About four hours into the parade, the luck of the Irish wore off
and the rain won, substantially thinning the throngs of people
lined up along the parade route.
   About 2 million people watched last year's parade under sunny
skies and organizers had hoped to at least match that.
   Ireland's patron saint was honored with parades elsewhere around
the country Saturday. New Orleans' parade was a feast _ literally,
as float riders tossed the makings for Irish stew, including
cabbages, potatoes and carrots, to people lining the streets.
   In the Northern California city of Dublin, officials decided to
give up the traditional St. Patrick's Day green beer drinking
contest.
   Mayor Paul Moffatt said he had mixed feelings about dropping the
event, but said ``you don't want to advertise to young people that
it may be all right to get snockered.''
   While New Yorkers were lamenting the rain on their parade,
thousands of people in Kansas City, Mo., considered themselves
blessed with sunny skies.
   ``We've had rain on every parade for the past five or six
years,'' said parade organizer Bill Richerson. ``This one will be
the best we've had in several years. It's really helped the
spirit.''
   The Kansas City parade had more than 170 entrants, including
marching bands, family floats, jig bands and ``Bugs O'Bunny.''
   For New York's event, the usually natty Mayor David Dinkins wore
a shiny green jacket purchased specially for the occasion of his
first parade as the city's chief executive.
   He was joined by about 125,000 other marchers _ including Gov.
Mario Cuomo, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and former Mayor Edward
I. Koch.
   ``It's a little bit of heaven,'' said Kathleen Sheridan, who
came from Ridgewood, N.J. to watch her fiance, a police officer,
march.
   ``I love the horses,'' said 3-year-old Sean Patrick Comiskey,
whose entire family was bundled in green sweaters.

   A Continental Airlines Boeing 737 carrying
130 passengers aborted a takeoff Saturday when its starboard engine
caught fire, an aviation official said.
   Flight 473 was bound for Denver when the incident occurred at
11:32 a.m., said Bob Raynesford, a spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administration in Kansas City, Mo.
   ``The aircraft had just begun its takeoff roll when the crew
heard a loud pop from the right engine,'' said Ned Walker, a
Continental spokesman. The captain ``stopped his takeoff roll and
pulled onto a taxiway and there apparently were some flames coming
from a portion of the engine.''
   The crew evacuated the passengers via emergency chutes as a
precautionary measure, Walker said. The plane was carrying 130
passengers and six crew members.
   ``One passenger had a minor scrape on his elbow but that's the
only injury,'' Walker said.
   The fire apparently was caused by an engine malfunction. Airline
personnel were to conduct a complete examination to learn the exact
cause, Walker said.
   The extent of damage to the plane was not immediately known,
although Raynesford said any engine fire indicates serious damage.

<HEAD>Recession Feared As a Result of Economic Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD LEWAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business leaders and economists
said Saturday they fear President Fernando Collor de Mello's
anti-inflation package will strangle the economy and plunge the
country into a deep recession.
   ``The imprisonment of the wealthy will not liberate the poor,''
said Paulo Rabello de Castro, an economist of the respected
Gertulio Vargas Foundation. ``This could well cause general
shortages of goods and services.''
   Collor, who took over Thursday and became Brazil's first
popularly elected leader since 1960, announced his economic plans
the next day.
   The measures include price controls, a new currency, a
devaluation and a crackdown on financial speculators. They are
intended to halt 2,700 percent annual inflation and restart
Brazil's stagnant economy.
   Most of the economic reforms were sent to Congress as
``provisional measures,'' which take effect immediately but can be
put to a vote within 30 days. They also become null if Congress
fails to call a vote within that period.
   The backbone of the package _ a severe tightening of the money
supply, sharp rises in taxes and utility costs, and cuts in
government subsidies and tax incentives _ prompted fears of worker
layoffs and a plunge in economic activity.
   Under the plan, withdrawals from savings accounts will be
limited to the equivalent of about $1,200. Businesses and citizens
with greater savings will only be allowed to withdraw their money
after 18 months.
   It was still not clear if businesses could pay bills and
expenses with the frozen funds, further adding to anxiety.
   Similar rules apply to key short-term deposits the government
uses to finance its $31 billion federal budget deficit. Those
accounts have paid interest rates of up to 105 percent a month, but
withdrawals will now be limited to about $600.
   ``I don't know up to what point the economy can be supported
without liquidity,'' said Teofilo Orth, president of the Brazilian
Association of Industrial Development.
   Economists also expressed fears that the lack of money in
circulation would disrupt the commercial supply chain across this
nation of 150 million.
   Several businessmen expressed doubts they would have enough
liquid funds to pay workers' salaries.
   The measures will be felt hard by middle- and upper-class
Brazilians, who provided much support for Collor during the 1989
presidential campaign. The plan ties up their pay for vacations,
homes or automobiles for 18 months.
   Middle-class Brazilians were already grumbling on Saturday.
   ``It's frustrating. You save a little to try to get ahead, and
they lock your money away in the government safe,'' said Sebastiao
Freitas Gomes, a 27-year-old computer analyst in Rio de Janeiro.
   Public service and utility increases decreed Friday added to the
anger. Fuel prices went up 56 percent, telephone rates 32 percent,
postal rates 80 percent, electricity 32 percent and air fares 50
percent.
   Labor minister Antonio Rogerio Magri defended the measures in a
nationally televised interview Saturday.
   ``I can guarantee the working man will not suffer by these
measures. The big financial speculators, those who invested in gold
and dollars and not in Brazil, will pay,'' he said.
   But labor unions, representing more than half of Brazil's 60
million workers, said the slowdown would lead to mass firings and a
drop in real wages.
   ``The economy will stop,'' said Jair Meneguelli, president of
the leftist Central Workers Union, the nation's largest. ``And if
workers lose their jobs, a general strike will be a way of fighting
back that will be considered.''
   Many Brazilians also seemed confused by the measures. Residents
expressed dismay at the fourth currency change in four years.
   ``First we had cruzeiros, then cruzados, then new cruzados, and
now back to cruzeiros?'' said Anaide de Soares, a 24-year-old
saleswoman in a Rio clothes shop. ``It's hard to trust leaders who
play with your money and raise the price of everything.''

   The state's two largest teachers
unions, under legal pressure to return to work, urged striking
teachers to end their 11-day-old walkout Saturday after gaining a
promise of cooperation from legislators.
   The agreement came after House Speaker Chuck Chambers and Senate
President Keith Burdette said they would recommend that Gov. Gaston
Caperton call a special legislative session to address teacher pay
and long-term education needs.
   The tentative settlement contained no promise of more money for
teachers, who had faced increasing pressure to call off the strike.
Several circuit courts had ruled it illegal and ordered teachers
back to the classroom.
   In addition, the state Supreme Court scheduled arguments for
Tuesday on the legality of a statewide back-to-work order issued by
a Kanawha County circuit judge.
   The settlement was announced Saturday afternoon by presidents of
the 16,000-member West Virginia Education Association and the
3,000-member West Virginia Federation of Teachers.
   ``This proposal and pending legal action are the reasons for
WVFT's decision to ask teachers to end the strike and return to the
classroom,'' said Bob Brown, president of the smaller union.
   ``We've moved education to the forefront so it just isn't
something that you pay lip service to during elections,'' said
Kayetta Meadows, president of the WVEA.
   Under the agreement, if teachers return to work Monday,
lawmakers and union leaders would begin work on a plan to improve
the state's education system by improving pay, benefits and
teaching conditions.
   Once a plan is developed, it would be submitted to a special
legislative session for approval before the start of the 1990-91
school year, Meadows said.
   The walkout, which affected two-thirds of the state's 22,000
teachers, began March 7. Teachers, who received a 5 percent pay
raise a month ago, said they wanted more money and lawmakers to
address their benefits packages.
   In earlier bargaining, the WVEA rejected Caperton's offer of a 5
percent pay raise, then rejected an offer for a special session,
saying it was too vague. But on Saturday, the lawmakers' promise to
seek a special session was accepted.
   ``Our state has been bitterly divided over this strike and the
healing process must begin,'' Chambers and Burdette said in a joint
statement issued Saturday.
   The announcement of the agreement gave few details. Meadows said
no agenda has been set for the unions' meetings with lawmakers and
that no one has suggested how pay raises could be funded.
   ``That is part of the plan that needs to be developed,'' Meadows
said. ``We haven't set the agenda.''
   Under the agreement, teacher groups in each county will decide
individually whether to return, Meadows and Brown said.
   ``My recommendation will be for them to go back in but continue
their campaign to inform the public and to watch what the
Legislature does,'' said Michael Gonzales, president of the
McDowell County Education Association. His group scheduled a vote
Sunday.
   Teachers in Greenbrier and Jackson counties had already voted to
return after local boards threatened to fire them. Educators in
other counties had votes scheduled for the weekend before the
tentative agreement was announced.
   Word of the settlement trickled slowly to the state's teachers.
Pete Rohal, a teacher in Hancock County, said he wasn't ready to
return to work blindly.
   ``I'll have to see what the package has,'' he said.
   The agreement was reached without discussions with the
governor's office, Meadows said. The governor's spokesman, however,
welcomed the news.
   ``It's reasonably consistent with what the governor has beeen
saying all along,'' said spokesman G.C. Morse said. ``He was
amenable to a special session all along but largely objected to
making commitments as a result of threats.''
   Caperton had said in three previous offers to end the strike
that he wouldn't call a special session as long as teachers
remained on strike.
   If the teachers return, the WVEA and the federation of teachers
plan to meet with Burdette and Chambers during the week, Meadows
said.
   ``We believe the plan will be completed prior to the beginning
of the school year,'' she said.
   Talks between the legislative leaders and the teachers began
Thursday after Caperton said he would no longer negotiate with
teachers. Caperton has said the only way he can provide teacher pay
raises is to raise taxes, which he said the public opposes.

   President Fidel Castro of Cuba called
Saturday for more economic cooperation among Latin American nations
and acknowledged that his island needs capitalist managerial skills.
   However, Castro, in a 55-minute speech inside the Latin American
Memorial cultural center in Sao Paulo, repeated his recent
declarations that Cuba will remain staunchly Communist and resist
U.S. influence.
   Castro railed against the region's huge foreign debt to
developed countries and called for greater Latin American economic
and cultural ties. The region has a collective foreign debt of
about $430 billion.
   ``It is time to break away from this role of subservience and
obedience to the developed world, especially towards the United
States,'' Castro said.
   He made his remarks during a two-day stopover to Sao Paulo after
attending the inauguration of President Fernando Collor de Mello.
   In the crowd was President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, as well
as Sao Paulo state officials.
   In the afternoon, Castro and Ortega toured the cultural complex,
built by renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer to promote
Latin American integration.
   Later Saturday, the Cuban leader told a group of 60 Sao Paulo
business leaders that he favors a Brazil-Cuba trade agreement and
increased joint ventures in both countries.
   Castro emphasized Cuba's advances in biotechnology and
pharmaceutical products. However, he conceded Cuba was ``in need of
capitalist managerial skills'' to make the island's economy run
smoother.
   Also Saturday, Castro addressed more than 1,000 members of the
progressive wing of Brazil's Roman Catholic Church.
   When asked why there weren't any Christians in the Cuban
Communist Party, Castro replied, ``I'm sure if we had people like
you in Cuba, you'd soon become members of the Communist Party.''
   Castro praised liberation theology and received thunderous
applause when he told the gathering he ``would like this type of
church to work in Cuba.''

   A Senate filibuster blocking action on a
bill that would liberalize the state's abortion law entered its
third day Saturday with no end in sight.
   Three votes were needed to end the filibuster by anti-abortion
legislators, and one senator who had been expected to vote to close
the debate said Saturday he has changed his mind.
   The bill blocked by the filibuster would replace a relatively
restrictive 1968 law that hasn't been enforced since the Supreme
Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling. Supporters of the bill want a
pro-choice replacement for the 1968 law in case the high court
overturns Roe vs. Wade.
   The proposed law would allow unrestricted access to abortions
until the fetus is able to survive outside the womb. Abortions
after the fetus is viable would be prohibited except to save the
life of the mother or to protect her physical or mental health.
   State Sen. John N. Bambacus, who previously had said he would
vote for cloture, said he changed his mind after learning the law
would allow post-viability abortions to save the mother's life, a
clause added as an amendment.
   He described the amendment as ``a mortal, strategic error on the
pro-choice side.''

Enforcement Administration was gutted by a large firebomb thrown
through a window early Saturday, authorities said. There were no
injuries reported.
   Investigators from several federal agencies were working
together to identify suspects in the 2:30 a.m. bombing, but refused
to say whether they had any.
   ABC News reported Saturday night that a man indicted last week
in a drug case had threatened to destroy the office in this
southwestern Florida city on the Gulf Coast.
   ``To my knowledge, we've never had an office of the Drug
Enforcement Administration destroyed in such a fashion,'' DEA
spokesman Tom Cash said from the scene. ``I think that obviously we
have been targeted. That's rather plain and rather clear.''
   Frank Shultz, a Washington, D.C., spokesman for the federal
agency, quoted the fire marshal in Fort Myers as saying the fire
was started by a ``large incendiary device'' thrown through a
window.
   The fire caused by the bombing gutted the 6,000-square-foot,
one-story building at a shopping-business mall, agency officials
said. Damage was estimated at $4 million. The drug agency was the
only tenant in the building.
   Three hours before the explosion, a car bombing was reported in
a residential area in south central Fort Myers, said Sheri
Peterson, a spokeswoman for the Lee County sheriff's office. She
did not have details and could not say whether the two bombings
were related. No injuries were reported.
   John Fernandes, DEA spokesman from the Miami field office, said
federal agents were investigating numerous possibilities to
determine who carried out the firebombing.
   ``It could be one of many individuals,'' he said. ``If you look
at the productivity of the Fort Myers office ... they've been
knocking them dead lately. We're checking all the most recent
indictments.''
   On Thursday, a federal grand jury indicted three men and a woman
from Fort Myers Beach in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The
woman, 20-year-old Kelly Susskind, was arrested along with
41-year-old Kenneth Bird. The other two, brothers identified by
police as 23-year-old Jeffery Matthews, also known as Jeffery
Ciganek, and 20-year-old John Ciganek, were still at large.
   Federal officials did not immediately link that case to the
explosion, but acknowledged that is one of many cases under
scrutiny. DEA agents planned to issue a nationwide alert for
suspects and were showing mug shots from the drug conspiracy case,
NBC News reported.
   Several agencies were involved in the probe, including the FBI,
DEA, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, as well
as state and local agencies. An FBI forensics team, including
explosives experts from Washington, D.C., was brought in to search
the crime scene.
   Although the records at the office were destroyed, authorities
said there are copies at other locations.
   ``This is an act of desperation,'' said Fernandes, who was in
Fort Myers to handle inquiries. ``If they think this is a setback
for us, it's not. This shows we're on the right track.
   ``We are office-automated so a lot of what we put on paper, we
also put in computer. A lot of what you think we would lose, we
have duplicated copies of,'' Fernandes said.
   The second bombing may have been just a diversion, he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walter T. Ridder, a former member of the
Knight-Ridder, Inc., board of directors whose newspaper career
spanned 50 years, died Saturday. He was 72.
   Ridder died at his home in suburban McLean, Va., after a long
illness.
   His first paying newspaper job was an $18-a-week reporting job
at the Hartford (Conn.) Times. He later worked for Ridder
newspapers in Duluth and St. Paul, Minn., and served as publisher
of the Gary, Ind., Post-Tribune.
   After serving as a war correspondent in Europe during World War
II _ he covered the liberation of the Nazi death camp at Dachau in
1945 _ he ran the information service for the Marshall Plan in
Paris and for many years headed the Ridder papers' Washington
bureau.
   His last job was on the board for Knight-Ridder, a post he
retired from last year.
   Ridder was born in New York City in 1917. His grandfather,
Hermann Ridder, came to the United States from Germany shortly
before the end of the 19th century and bought an interest in a
German language paper in New York, the Staats-Zeitung.
   That was the root of the Ridder publishing empire, which grew to
include 19 newspapers, radio and television stations at the time it
merged with Knight newspapers in 1974.
   When he went to work for his family's paper in Duluth, he
started in the circulation department but soon asked to be
transferred to the editorial side.
   He later wrote that while ``the other departments of a newspaper
are indisputably necessary, the heart and soul of journalism rested
in the reporters, copy desk men, rewrite men and editors.''
   Ridder is survived by his wife, Marie, whom he married in 1948;
four children: Cary (Mrs. David Alberswerth) of Washington, D.C.;
Stephanie (Mrs. John Beardsley) of Bethesda, Md.; Victor F. (Rick)
Ridder of Denver; Ms. Pamela Ridder of New York City; and seven
grandchildren.
   He also is survived by three sisters, Joan (Mrs. David
Challinor) of Washington, D.C.; Gretchen (Mrs. Peter Nicholas) of
New York City; Ms. Esther Ridder of New York City, and a brother,
Robert Ridder of St. Paul.

<HEAD>Bush Reported Willing to Accept Big Military Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will propose cuts in the
1991 military budget of $10 billion or $11 billion, nearly triple
what the White House had originally proposed, according to a
published report.
   The higher cuts are almost as large as those urged by many
congressmen, The New York Times said in Sunday's editions.
   If no cuts were made, the 1990 military budget of $296 billion
would go up to about $306 billion next year as a result of
inflation and previous commitments.
   In January, the administration proposed cutting $3.2 billion
from the $306 billion outlay.
   But that figure was dismissed as far too small, even by
Republican conservatives like Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
   ``The fact is that we all know beyond any possible doubt that
the Soviet Union isn't about to launch an attack,'' McCain told the
Times.
   He said Bush's original defense spending proposals did not
reflect the demise of Communism in Eastern Europe and the end of
the Cold War.
   The administration apparently revised the proposed cuts because
officials realized they would have to give considerable ground to
win approval from Congress for the military budget, the Times said,
quoting senior government officials.
   Congressional Democrats and even some Republicans have advocated
reductions of about $12 billion or $13 billion.
   All savings would be applied toward the overall 1991
deficit-reduction target of $36 billion in the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law.

   Some of the biggest names in the music industry
turned out Saturday night for a benefit concert billed as the
single largest fund-raising event for AIDS.
   The ``That's What Friends Are For'' concert at Radio City Music
Hall was expected to raise between $2 million and $3 million.
   Carly Simon, Whitney Houston, Air Supply, the Eurythmics, Dionne
Warwick, Jermaine Jackson, Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates, Patti Smith,
Milli Vanilli and Kenny G. were among those artists scheduled to
perform.
   The concert was sponsored by Arista Records, which was
celebrating its 15th anniversary.
   Proceeds from the concert will go to the Gay Men's Health Crisis
and other AIDS organizations.
   The health crisis group, founded in 1981, has over 1,600
volunteers who provide support services to more than 2,700 people
with AIDS. The organization also advocates public education on the
fatal disease.
   Executive Director Jeffrey Braff said he was grateful for the
fundraising effort.
   ``It's very exciting,'' he said. ``People have started to become
complacent about AIDS and there's nothing to become complacent
about for a long, long time.''
   The concert took its title from a popular single of the same
name.
   In 1986, Ms. Warwick joined with Elton John, Stevie Wonder and
Gladys Knight to record ``That's What Friends Are For,'' which
spent four weeks at No. 1 on the billboard charts. The royalties _
more than $1 million _ were donated to the American Foundation for
AIDS Research.
   Actor Michael Douglas and Clive Davis, president of Arista
Records, helped organize the event. Other hosts included Chevy
Chase, Whoopi Goldberg, Melanie Griffith and Jane Curtin.

<HEAD>Paper Says Federal Investigation Targets Austin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Secret Service has seized computer
equipment from a publishing company and two homes in an
investigation into tampering with the nation's 911 emergency
network, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   The Austin American-Statesman said secret service agents and
Austin police seized computer modems, manuals, instruction books
and other documents in March 1 raids on the offices of Steve
Jackson Games in Austin and on the homes of the managing editor and
an acquaintance of the company's owner.
   The newspaper attributed its information to unidentified sources
linked to a nationwide federal inquiry based in the U.S. attorney's
office in Chicago. It said the equipment has been sent to federal
officials in Chicago.
   No arrests have been made. An attorney for the company owner
told the newspaper that federal officials have assured him the
owner, Steve Jackson, is not a target of the investigation.
   ``It is an ongoing investigation _ that is all I can say,'' said
Steve Beauchamp, special agent-in-charge of the Secret Service's
field office in Austin. ``Until we can put it all together, we just
do not comment.''
   The owner told the newspaper neither he nor his company has
tampered with the 911 emergency system. The company, which
publishes fiction and creates computer games, is not involved in
computer-related thefts, he said.
   The newspaper said agents also seized the final draft of a
science fiction game written by the company. The agents were trying
to determine whether the game _ a futuristic account of a world
where technology has gone awry _ is being used as a handbook for
computer crime, the newspaper said.
   The Secret Service has jurisdiction because damage to the
nation's telephone system could harm the public's welfare,
officials said. In addition, the 911 system is run by American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., a company involved in the nation's
defense.
   Federal authorities are focusing on Austin's ties to an
underground computer group known as the Legion of Doom, the
newspaper said.
   A similar investigation has resulted in the indictment of two
computer ``hackers'' in Chicago who are believed to be members of
the Legion of Doom. They are charged with interstate transportation
of stolen property, wire fraud, and violations of the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, the newspaper said.
   The government alleges they stole a computerized copy of Bell
South's system that controls 911 emergency calls in nine states.
The information was then transferred to a computer bulletin board
and published in a hacker publication known as ``Phrack.'' A trial
is scheduled for June.

   Skippy, a San Francisco Zoo kangaroo that
received a pacemaker in a first-of-its-kind operation, has died of
complications from a weak heart, zoo officials said.
   The 7-year-old red kangaroo died Wednesday at the University of
California at Davis Veterinary Hospital, where she had been
transferred after the March 5 surgery.
   Zoo Director Phil Arnold said that even with the pacemaker,
Skippy's heart contractions weren't strong enough to move blood
through her body.
   Veterinarians decided to try a pacemaker when they discovered
the animal's heart rate was slow and dropping.
   A team of cardiologists led by Dr. John Langbert of the UC San
Francisco Medical School performed the operation. The pacemaker was
donated.
   ``The pacemaker implant was a first for a kangaroo,'' said
Arnold. ``We had hoped that the surgery would have prolonged her
life and are saddened by the loss.''

   A freight train derailed and flipped two
tankers carrying hazardous materials Saturday. One sprung a minor
leak and about 100 homes were evacuated for part of the day,
officials said.
   No injuries were reported.
   Two of the five CSX Transportation tankers on the 124-car
freight train overturned onto their sides shortly after 8 a.m. One
tanker leaked a chemical, styrene monomer inhibited, said Bob Moore
of Gibson County 911.
   The chemical is a colorless, odorless liquid used in making
synthetic rubber and plastics. It ``can cause some explosions if it
goes to the point of ignition,'' Moore said. ``It's a health
hazard.''
   Everyone up to a mile away in this rural western Tennessee
county was evacuated, Moore said.
   David King of the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency
described the leak as minor. It was contained and people returned
to their homes Saturday afternoon.
   The other overturned tanker contained tolulene, a highly
flammable liquid solvent, Shepard said.

<HEAD>New Indictment Details Medellin Cartel's Vast Financial Network</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Cocaine Bust</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new indictment against Medellin
cocaine cartel leaders details the vast financial network they
allegedly used to hide between $60 millon and $100 million in drug
profits in bank accounts worldwide.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ernst D. Mueller said the new
indictment, which supersedes a previous indictment in the so-called
``Son of Lehder'' case, lists 20 defendants, 19 of whom are still
fugitives.
   Federal prosecutors have frozen accounts worldwide of cartel
leader Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, who maintained more than 70
accounts in seven foreign countries from 1984 until his death in
December, Mueller said.
   The indictment, which was filed Jan. 26 but remained sealed
until Thursday, said Gacha's accounts were listed under corporate
names of Transcontinental Traders, Union Enterprises and First
Interstate Ltd. Those accounts, Mueller said, contain between $60
million and $100 million.
   ``The big thing is to immobilize the funds and not let the
druggers have them,'' Mueller said.
   Much of the financial information was obtained when Colombian
officials raided a ranch house belonging to Gacha's nephew in Yari,
Colombia, in October, Mueller said. The prosecutor said he didn't
know if the money would be forfeited, saying that was ``a secondary
thing.''
   Gacha, Carlos Lehder Rivas, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, Jorge Ochoa
Vasquez and Fabio Ochoa Vasquez joined in the 1970s to create the
Medellin cartel, which is believed to account for 80 percent of the
cocaine smuggled into the United States.
   Lehder was convicted in Jacksonville in 1988 and sentenced to
life in prison without the possibility of parole, plus 135 years.
   The ``Son of Lehder'' case indictments came from information
learned by prosecutors during his 7{-month-long trial. In a trial
last fall involving five people indicted in the case, three men
were convicted and two were acquitted.
   Each of the cartel leaders was named in the ``Son of Lehder''
indictment last year and are included in the new superseding
indictment.
   The new indictment was unsealed when one of the new defendants,
John D. Liebolt, surrendered to U.S. marshals at the federal
courthouse in Jacksonville.
   Three of new defendants are accused of controlling Gacha's bank
accounts from 1984 until his death on Dec. 15.
   Liebolt, 66, of Atlanta, is accused of providing a plane that
was used to transport cocaine into the United States in 1978. He
faces conspiracy charges.
   Liebolt had been hiding in New York since he was indicted last
June under the previous ``Son of Lehder'' indictment, Mueller said.
He has pleaded innocent. U.S. Magistrate Harvey E. Schlesinger set
bond at $50,000.

<TEXT>
   The Vatican announced Saturday it appointed
an Italian financial expert as director of its scandal-tainted
bank, which was formerly led by American Archbishop Paul C.
Marcinkus.
   Giovanni Bodio, 67, is the first lay person to lead the bank,
formally called the Institute for Religious Works.
   The post of director was created last year as part of a general
reorganization that put the management of the Vatican bank's
affairs in the hands of a supervisory board of lay financial
experts from five countries.
   Marcinkus was president of the Milan-based bank from 1969 until
the position was abolished last year.
   Italian courts issued arrest warrants for Marcinkus and two lay
Vatican bank officials in 1987 after prosecutors charged them with
being accessories to the fraudulent bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano,
which collapsed in 1982.
   But the arrests were never carried out. Italy's Constitutional
Court ruled that a Vatican-Italian treaty precluded any
interference by Italian authorities into the affairs of the
Vatican, an independent city-state.
   The Vatican denied any wrongdoing in the collapse of Banco
Ambrosiano, but it agreed in 1984 to pay $250 million to its
creditors.
   Marcinkus, a native of Cicero, Ill., still holds another Vatican
post, the equivalent of deputy governor of the Vatican city-state.
   Bodio has been serving as president of Finreme, an umbrella
organization for corporate finance institutions.
   The Vatican bank's supervisory board appointed him after gaining
approval Friday from a special commission of five cardinals that
oversees the bank, the Vatican statement said.

   Federal regulators have seized the city's
third largest thrift, calling the Pacific Coast Savings and Loan
Association of America ``nearly insolvent.''
   Customers will be unaffected by Friday's action involving the
largest San Francisco Bay area thrift to be placed under the
government's conservatorship program since the mid-1980s, officials
said.
   The institution will maintain regular business hours and all
deposits under $100,000 are federally insured.
   Laurence Schannault, who has been named managing agent for the
Resolution Trust Corp., which will run Pacific Coast Savings until
a buyer can be found, said the institution's management was too
conservative and failed to get an adequate return on loans to cover
interest paid on deposits.
   Shareholders retain ownership of Pacific Coast, but the stock is
essentially worthless because the company is so close to
insolvency, officials said.
   Nationwide, the government has seized 393 failed S&amp;Ls in the
past year. Elsewhere, the federal Office of Thrift Supervision
recently took over United Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association in New
Orleans, the only surviving minority-owned thrift in the area.
   Pacific Coast lost money for nine straight quarters and for the
first three months of 1989 _ the latest data publicly available _
lost $5.2 million, the OTS said.
   In the past two years, Pacific Coast sold four of its nine
branches and laid off almost 100 staff members out of 300.
   All state thrifts that don't meet stringent capital requirements
imposed by Congress must submit plans to the OTS explaining how
they plan to boost capital in the next few years. Pacific Coast's
plan was rejected, said OTS spokesman Dan Pag.

   Caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
responded Saturday to a growing revolt against his leadership of
the right-wing Likud bloc, saying he will not be angry if he is
ousted.
   Shamir spoke in an interview with Israel radio as Likud's
Parliament faction convened to consider strategies after the
party's defeat in a parliamentary vote of no confidence Thursday.
   The government's downfall came after Shamir fired Shimon Peres,
the leader of the left-of-center Labor party, as vice premier
Tuesday. The dispute developed over differences on U.S. proposals
for convening Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
   Shamir's detractors hold him responsible for losing support from
two key religious parties who defected from a longstanding alliance
to help Labor bring down the government.
   In a prerecorded interview broadcast Saturday, Shamir dismissed
the talk of his removal as ``isolated voices (which) make no
impression on me.''
   But he added, ``I won't be angry with anybody if one day Likud's
institutions convene and decide to change the chairman of the
movement. I won't be angry or enraged. ... I have gone through many
experiences and changes. Nothing surprises me anymore.''
   On Friday, Shamir's aides denied reports that the premier has
considered resigning.
   The Likud rebels hope that by replacing the 74-year-old leader,
they can form a new government by wooing back the religious parties.
   ``There is a fact we cannot hide: Likud cannot form a government
with Shamir as head,'' Likud legislator Reuven Rivlin said on
Israel television.
   Spearheading the revolt against Shamir are hard-liners Deputy
Premier David Levy and former Industry Minister Ariel Sharon. But
several traditional Shamir backers joined the fray Saturday, the
radio said.
   Possible successors mentioned were Levy and Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens, who is Likud's No. 2 leader.
   So far, Peres appears likely to be chosen by President Chaim
Herzog to build a ruling coalition in light of his majority in
Thursday's vote. Herzog launches consultations with party leaders
Sunday before reaching his decision expected later this month.
   By Israeli law, Shamir remains caretaker premier until a new
government is formed.

   Firefighters worked Saturday night to
douse a petroleum tank blaze at a refinery where an explosion six
years ago killed 17 people.
   There was one minor injury reported during the fire at the
Unocal Corp.'s Chemical Division refinery, and emergency disaster
officials said it could take nearly a day to extinguish to blaze.
   The fire, which broke out at 6 p.m., was brought under control
around 8:30 p.m. but could take up to 20 hours to completely put
out, said Lynn Behringer, a spokeswoman for the region's Emergency
Services and Disaster Agency.
   ``The flames are about 20 to 30 feet in the air,'' a neighbor,
Joseph Dunk, said earlier. ``They are blowing up very high because
of the gusts that are really bad, and there's also really thick
black smoke out there.''
   The burning tank held 250,000 barrels of an oil-gasoline
mixture, Behringer said.
   Firefighters from at least 10 nearby communities were on the
scene about 20 miles southwest of Chicago, a Bolingbrook fire
dispatcher said. They were using foam to contain the flames and
were draining the tank at rate of 3,000 barrels an hour.
   On July 23, 1984, a propane gas explosion at the refinery killed
17 people, injured 21 others and caused $100 million in damage.

   Representatives of Greyhound and its
striking bus drivers haggled all day over a union proposal
Saturday, but reported little progress in their first meeting since
the violent, 2-week-old strike began.
   Negotiations began at mid-morning and recessed Saturday night
with promises from both sides to meet again in the morning.
   ``It's late. We're tired. Nothing has happened,'' said Greyhound
executive vice president Anthony Lannie.
   He said the intercity bus company had not yet responded to a
proposal presented earlier Saturday by unions representing the
striking workers.
   Union officials said their proposal involved a $40 million
three-year package that included modest pay increases of 4-5
percent and the addition of new drivers to the pension plan.
   Ed Strait, president of Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local
Unions, said the talks were progressing ``very slow, very slow. ...
We expected this.''
   A union spokesman said the company has offered a plan that
included no guarantee of any pay hikes, but would have made raises
contingent on increased profits and ridership.
   The company rejected an offer to bring in ``number crunchers''
from both sides and see if a compromise could be worked out, said a
union representative.
   Federal mediators are with company officials and union
negotiators here in the first face-to-face meeting since 6,300
drivers and an estimated 3,000 other Greyhound workers walked out
March 2 over wages, job security and grievance procedures.
   Greyhound operates the only nationwide intercity bus service,
and the strike has stranded many smaller communities for which
buses are the only public transportation.
   Since the walkout began, there have been at least 14 shooting
attacks on Greyhound buses, 46 bomb threats and numerous other
incidents of vandalism or threats, Greyhound officials said.
   Both sides reserved expectations for talks Saturday because of
the incidents, but were willing to get together.
   ``I guess the best way to characterize my feeling is that I have
high hopes but very low expectations,'' Greyhound Lines Inc.
Chairman Fred G. Currey said Friday.
   Currey has repeatedly said that Greyhound can afford no more
than the $63 million, three-year contract it first offered.
   Jeffrey Nelson, spokesman in Washington for the Amalgamated
Greyhound Unions, has said the two sides are ``not that far apart''
on financial aspects, but differ on grievance procedures.
   The company says it has been operating roughly one-third of its
buses with replacement and non-striking drivers. The company says
394 union drivers are at work, joining 1,002 permanent
replacements. The union says only 94 of its drivers have crossed
the pickets lines.
   Meanwhile, in Washington state, a judge has issued a restraining
order limiting pickets or non-picket demonstrations to 20 persons
within 20 feet of any Greyhound Lines Inc. facility entrance or
exit in the state.
   King County Superior Court Judge Terrence A. Carroll ruled
Friday that there had been vandalism of Greyhound property and
attempts to ``harass or impede'' the company's buses on highways.

   A terrorist group has claimed
responsibility for the fatal crash of two U.S. helicopters and the
bombing of a discotheque, and it threatened more attacks on
Americans and U.S. property.
   The group calls itself the Dec. 20 Movement, or M-20, and is the
first terrorist group to surface following the Dec. 20 U.S.
invasion that overthrew military dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   One U.S. soldier was killed, and 16 American military personnel
and 12 Panamanians were injured in the grenade attack on the
discotheque March 2.
   The U.S. Southern Command said the Feb. 21 helicopter crashes
near Colon, at the northern end of the Panama Canal, killed 11
soldiers, and it blamed the crashes on bad weather.
   The Dec. 20 Movement claimed in a handout distributed Friday in
the western city of David that 30 soldiers died.
   ``It was not an accident as they have said,'' it said.
   The U.S. Southern Command made no comment on the statement.
   Officials of the government of President Guillermo Endara,
installed at the start of the invasion, have said pro-Noriega
groups were known to exist and were likely to have access to large
weapons caches believed still hidden in the country.
   Witnesses said men who threw the grenade at the disco yelled
``Viva Noriega!''
   Government and Justice Minister Ricardo Arias Calderon said
authorities did not have enough information to confirm M-20 was
responsible for the bombing. He said it also appeared to involve a
dispute among drug traffickers.
   Rosendo Samudio Bonagas, a member of the small communist Party
of the People, was arrested Friday in David for handing out the
fliers, and authorities said they were seeking two others, Panama
City newspapers reported Saturday.
   ``We will attack everything we find in our path, especially
property of the United States,'' the flier said. ``We will avenge
our dead ... A soldier, dressed in civilian clothes or in uniform,
will be executed.
   ``Our principal objective is everything that smells of gringos.
We ask Panamanians not to go around with them because they will be
in danger.''
   It also threatened to attack vehicles with ``homosexual signs of
`Just Cause,''' the military name for the U.S. invasion, and said
``we will do the same with those who applauded the cowardly
aggression.''
   Most Panamanians welcomed the invasion and new government, but
officials say discontent could build quickly in the large ranks of
unemployed.
   About one-third of the work force of 650,000 is jobless,
officials say.
   M-20 also threatened the David International Fair, which opened
Friday, and Endara and President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, calling
them ``personalities of the Yankee embassy.'' The presidents
canceled a planned meeting at the fair, apparently for reasons
unrelated to the threats.
   The agricultural and crafts fair promotes trade in the region.
   Early this week, 75 truckloads of soldiers in combat gear went
to David to help provide security for the event.

<TEXT>
   Bulgaria may send prosecutors to Britain to
investigate the 1978 killing of a Bulgarian exile stabbed to death
with a poisoned umbrella, the Foreign Office said Friday.
   Britain has blamed Bulgaria for the death of Georgi Markov, who
fled to London in 1969 and worked for the Bulgarian service of the
British Broadcasting Corp. He was killed by a poison pellet
injected by an umbrella tip as he walked across London's Waterloo
Bridge in September 1978.
   British officials suspect the murder was the work of agents of
Bulgaria's Communist government, which was controlled by
hard-liners until last year's reforms swept much of Eastern Europe.
Britain has pressed the Bulgarian government to take responsibility.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said Bulgarian Ambassador Dimitar
Zhulev told British officials Friday that Bulgaria was willing to
send prosecutors to discuss the case with British officials. No
date was given for a visit, and there were no further details.

   A strike by city bus drivers seeking pay
hikes halted all bus service in the Spanish capital Friday,
affecting an estimated 1 million commuters.
   The walkout by the 1,200 bus drivers of the independent
Plataforma Sindical stranded buses in garages across Madrid.
   The strike has been opposed by the two major Socialist and
Communist unions, which reached their own agreements.
   In other labor turmoil, unions representing drivers of buses
linking Madrid to regional towns began a 24-hour strike for higher
pay at noon Friday.
   There were no reports of violence in either strike.
   A Muncipal Bus Co. spokesman said about 1 million passengers
ride the city's 1,800 buses every day. The strike forced many to
take to their cars, increasing traffic in much of the city, the
Madrid traffic office said.
   The Plataforma Sindical group is demanding an immediate salary
boost of $227 a month, topped by a 7.5 percent increase, the group
said in a statement.
   Bus drivers now take home $7,378 to $10,178 a year, a company
spokesman said.

<TEXT>
   A witness who backed out of a deal to cooperate
with prosecutors in a racial killing was indicted on murder charges
Friday and ordered held without bail for his role in the fatal
assault.
   John Vento, 21, who had been promised immunity from prosecution
in exchange for testimony against his friends who allegedly took
part in the slaying, faces 25 years to life in jail if convicted of
murder.
   ``While we are not alleging he was the shooter, he was a major
player,'' said Assistant District Attorney Paul Burns.
   Vento fled after the Aug. 23 shooting in the Bensonhurst section
of Brooklyn, but he soon contacted prosecutors and said he would be
willing to testify if they agreed not to charge him in the attack.
He testified before a grand jury, then fled again around Christmas.
   Vento surrendered to the FBI in Ohio on March 5 after his
absence forced an adjournment of the start of the trials. Earlier
this week, he told prosecutors he would rather face charges than
testify.
   State Supreme Court Justice Thaddeus Owens refused to set bail,
noting Vento's two disappearences. Supreme Court is a trial court
in New York.
   ``I think he's a bad risk _ that's my gut reaction,'' Owens
said. ``When I follow my gut, I don't go wrong.''
   Vento and seven other young white men are charged in the murder
of a black teen-ager, Yusuf Hawkins.
   Hawkins and three friends, all black, were surrounded by some 30
white men, many carrying bats, when they went to the mainly white
Bensonhurst neighborhood to look at a used car for sale.
   Hawkins, 16, died when one of the whites, allegedly defendant
Joseph Fama, shot him in the chest.

<HEAD>Luxury Chicago Towers That Received Exemptions Now Deliquent on
Mortgage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A luxury high-rise apartment complex that
received federal backing on a $158.9 million mortgage loan is
delinquent and has asked the government for $16 million to help
tide it over, housing officials said Friday.
   ``It's certainly better for us to reasonably consider giving
them a $16 million loan rather than having to pay off $150 million
_ that's the consideration,'' said Adolph Slaughter, a local
spokesman for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   The 48-story four-building complex, called Presidential Towers,
began generating controversy even before its construction in the
mid-1980s. Community activists said it would displace many poor and
homeless people.
   With the help of U.S. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Chicago, the
developers received a federal exemption from requirements that they
set aside some apartments for low-income renters.
   Unfurnished studios start at $525 a month, while three-bedroom
units begin at $2,460. The four towers, on the western edge of
downtown, have more than 2,300 apartments in all.
   The organization that owns Presidential Towers, The Habitat Co.,
made its last mortgage payment on the $158.9 million loan in
January, executive vice president Douglas Woodworth said Friday.
   The loan is held by American National Bank &amp; Trust Co. of
Chicago, a subsidiary of First Chicago Corp., and is insured by the
Federal Housing Administration.
   If it went into default, it would mark one of the biggest
defaults ever on an FHA loan, Slaughter said.
   Woodworth said Habitat was unable to make its payments in part
because ``real-estate taxes were higher than we anticipated.'' He
also said a tight rental market forced Habitat to grant more
concessions to attract renters than had been anticipated. He said
the towers were about 90 percent leased.
   On March 1, American National filed a default notice with HUD _
an action Slaughter described as routine.
   ``They have not defaulted _ they are delinquent,'' he said.
``There is a distinct difference.''
   Slaughter said HUD is examining Habitat's loan request.
   Woodworth said he is confident the developers will be able to
turn their financial situation around if they receive the HUD loan
to cover operating losses.

<HEAD>Jury Reports Deadlock on Aguilar, Told To Resume Deliberations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A federal court jury said Friday it was
deadlocked on all eight charges against U.S. District Judge Robert
Aguilar, who is accused of trying to influence criminal cases for
his friends.
   The trial judge told jurors to resume their deliberations, and
sent them home for the weekend after another 90 minutes. Aguilar's
lawyers moved unsuccessfully for a mistrial and said they would
renew the motion Monday.
   The developments came during the sixth full day of deliberations
in the trial of Aguilar, the first federal judge ever charged with
racketeering.
   Aguilar, 58, of San Jose, a 1980 appointee of President Jimmy
Carter, is accused of approaching two fellow judges to seek
favorable treatment for felons; disclosing a wiretap to its target;
helping a fugitive remain free, and of fabricating a coverup story
to the FBI and a grand jury.
   The charges are punishable by 55 years in prison and $2 million
in fines. Aguilar also could be impeached by Congress, which has
removed three other federal judges from office since 1986.
   Also charged in the case are former Teamster leader Rudy Tham
and Abe Chapman, an 83-year-old ex-convict who was formerly related
to Aguilar by marriage. The are accused of trying to get Aguilar to
use his influence with a colleague to help Tham get a new trial on
a 1980 embezzlement conviction.
   Jury foreman Carl D'Amico told U.S. District Judge Louis Bechtle
at mid-afternoon Friday that the jurors had deliberated on every
charge without reaching a unanimous decision on any of the
allegations against any defendant.
   Bechtle rejected a defense request to ask the jurors whether
further deliberations would be fruitful, a prelude to declaring a
mistrial. Instead, he ordered jurors back to work after delivering
a version of the so-called ``dynamite charge'' that is sometimes
given to deadlocked juries.
   Jurors in the minority should ``ask themselves if they are right
... consider the views of the other jurors,'' Bechtle said. ``If
you can do so without violence to your individual judgment, it is
highly desirable that there be a verdict.''
   Aguilar denied any attempt to influence cases or obstruct
justice. His lawyers portrayed him as a decent man who made some
mistakes in judgment out of loyalty to friends.

<TEXT>
   A young boy panted and pawed for
attention after he was rescued from a dirt-floored pen at his
grandparents' home, where he was kept along with 60 dogs, witnesses
testified Friday in a child neglect trial.
   ``He howled. He reared back on his haunches, tilted his head and
looked up,'' said Cheryl Shropshire, the boy's Department of Human
Services foster parent. ``He acted like a little dog.''
   Gene and Joyce White are charged with failing to care for a
minor, a misdemeanor. Their jury-trial started Thursday in Muskogee
County District Court.
   The Whites, who are representing themselves, said the boy's
behavior was natural for a 4-year-old, and that he was imitating
cartoon characters he saw on television.
   `Our prime concern is for the child, and it has been from the
very beginning,'' said White, 54.
   Vicki Cowan, the Whites' daughter and the boy's aunt, testified
her parents kept the boy in the pen because they worried he would
run onto U.S. 69, which runs in front of the Whites' home.
   District Attorney Drew Edmondson told jurors the boy learned his
bizarre behavior by being left in the uncovered, dirt-floored dog
pen.
   ``The child's behavior ... of acting like a dog is imitating the
environment he was exposed to at home,'' Edmondson said. ``His time
in that dog pen was not an isolated occurrence, but was the
standard of care for that child.''
   Ms. Shropshire said the boy continued to behave strangely after
he was brought to her home Aug. 30, including fetching toys with
his mouth.
   ``He ran wildly through the house, crashing into walls, and most
of the time he ran on all fours. If he wanted attention, he would
run up to us and paw at our bodies, rub his head on us, and
whimper,'' Ms. Shropshire said.
   Edmondson showed jurors a videotape made by a social worker in
the Shropshires' living room that showed the boy panting, drooling,
grabbing a balloon in his mouth and barking.
   Ms. Cowan and White both testified the boy's mother abandoned
him when he was 6 months old.
   ``As grandparents, you might say we got the child by default,''
White said.
   The grandparents were arrested Aug. 29 after a visitor reported
seeing the boy inside a wire cage. The Whites each face up to a
year in jail and a $500 fine if convicted.

   Two members of the rock group Red Hot
Chili Peppers were arrested Friday after one of them allegedly
threw a female student to the sand and simulated sex with her.
   The incident occurred Wednesday during the taping of the band by
MTV at the Texan Motel during Spring Break, police said Friday.
   Members of the rock group entered the crowd of onlookers, and
bass guitarist Michael Peter Balzary, also known as Flea, picked up
a 20-year-old student from Virginia and slung her over his
shoulder, police said.
   Despite the woman's repeated protests and attempts to free
herself, she was thrown onto the sand.
   Drummer Chad Smith joined Balzary, and pulled the woman's
bathing suit bottom partially off and started slapping her
buttocks, according to Beach Ranger Guy Grasso's report.
   Balzary then allegedly jumped on top of the woman and began to
simulate sexual activity before MTV personnel intervened.
   The woman was not seriously hurt but was bruised and shaken by
the incident, said John Kirvan, Volusia County beach police chief.
   ``We're not putting up with this garbage. If it was my daughter,
I'd be pounding on someone's chest to get some action,'' he said.
   Balzary and Smith were arrested about 2 a.m. Friday after a
concert at the Daytona Beach Marriott.
   Balzary, 26, was charged with battery, disorderly conduct and
solicitation to commit an unnatural and lascivious act and released
on $2,000 bail. Smith, 28, was charged with battery and released on
$1,000 bail. The charges are misdemeanors.
   Neither Balzary nor Smith could be reached for comment Friday,
nor could anyone at EMI Records, the company that produces the
Peppers' albums.

   A judge said Friday an agreement was reached
to end a 5{-week sit-in at City Hall by a group protesting the
school board's decision to dismiss Selma's first black school chief.
   Protesters agreed to leave City Hall at 4:30 p.m. Friday,
Lauderdale County Circuit Judge Leslie Johnson said. In return, the
city agreed to drop contempt of court charges against the
demonstrators, who have been living in tents.
   Johnson said he had to ``strongarm'' city officials and
protesters into accepting the agreement.
   ``I honestly and truly believe it is for the best in this
situation,'' he said.
   The 10 remaining protesters left shortly after 4:30 p.m., said
one of them, Dallas County Commissioner Perry Varner.
   The city also agreed to dismiss criminal charges against four
protesters stemming from a scuffle in the mayor's office several
weeks ago pending payment of property damages. Those arrested at
Mayor Joe Smitherman's office included Varner and two attorneys.
   In return, one of the attorneys, Rose Sanders, agreed to drop
charges against police officer Ronnie Rushing, whom she accused of
physically abusing her while transporting her to jail.
   Johnson ruled March 10 that protesters could not continue the
round-the-clock sit-in they began Feb. 6 to protest the Selma Board
of Education's decision not to renew the contract of Superintendent
Norward Roussell.
   The judge said the protesters could occupy City Hall during
normal business hours, but not at other times.
   The protesters, however, continued their sit-in, which prompted
city attorneys to seek a contempt of court citation against the
leaders.
   Roussell has been the focus of protests that began in December
when the school board's white majority decided on his removal. That
decision prompted student boycotts, school closings and mass
marches in support of Roussell.

<HEAD>Nation's Toughest Anti-Abortion Law Clears State Senate Panel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation that advocates say would give
Idaho the nation's toughest anti-abortion law cleared a state
Senate committee Friday and was headed for final legislative vote.
   The bill would ban abortion as a means of birth control. It
would outlaw abortion except in cases of nonstatutory rape reported
within seven days, incest if the victim is under 18 years old,
severe fetal deformity or a threat to life or physical health of
the mother.
   ``Idaho is taking the step, and is willing to take the step, to
lead this nation in protecting the life of unborn children,''
declared Kerry Uhlenkott of Right To Life of Idaho.
   Anti-abortion activists campaigning for the bill said they see
it as a potential vehicle to attack the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973
Roe vs. Wade ruling, which legalized abortion. Legal challenges are
a near-certainty if the bill becomes law, and such a challenge
could reach the high court, supporters have said.
   In Annapolis, Md., meanwhile, anti-abortion legislators on
Friday continued a filibuster that blocked action on a bill that
would liberalize the state's abortion law.
   The Idaho Senate's State Affairs Committee voted 7-4 to send the
strict abortion bill to the full Senate for final action, probably
on Wednesday. Since the bill is identical to a measure passed by
the House last week, Senate approval would send the measure to Gov.
Cecil Andrus for signature.
   ``A handful of senators are uncertain,'' said Sen. Roger Madsen,
a Republican. ``But even if the bill losses all the undecideds,
we'll still win.''
   Andrus has declined to commented on the measure, other than to
reiterate his opposition to abortion except in the case of rape,
incest or a threat to the life of the mother.
   Legislators on both sides of the issue agreed the measure would
preclude over 90 percent of the estimated 1,500 abortions performed
in Idaho each year.
   The Maryland bill blocked by the filibuster would replace a
relatively restrictive 1968 law that hasn't been enforced since the
the Roe vs. Wade ruling. Supporters of the bill want a pro-choice
replacement for the 1968 law in case the Supreme Court overturns
Roe vs. Wade.
   The proposed law would allow unrestricted access to abortions
until the fetus is able to survive outside the womb. Abortions
after the fetus is viable would be prohibited except to save the
life of the mother or to protect her physical or mental health.

<HEAD>State Closes Camp Whose Residents Drowned During Sierra Lake
Outing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state on Friday closed the
juvenile probation camp whose two counselors and three students
were among seven people who drowned last month in an icy Eastern
Sierra lake.
   The California Department of Social Services cited allegations
of sexual misconduct, lack of supervision and improper medication
of students at Camp O'Neal in ordering the closure.
   Sixteen residents of the camp for youthful offenders were
immediately relocated to other facilities pending the outcome of a
hearing to revoke its operating permit, said Kathleen Norris, an
agency spokeswoman.
   Three teen-agers from the camp, two camp counselors and two
would-be rescuers drowned in nearby Convict Lake on Feb. 19 after
the youths broke through thin ice during a Presidents Day outing.
The adults died trying to save the others.
   The camp director, Bobbi Trott, called the closure unfounded and
said she was confident the matter would be successfully appealed.
The camp has 15 days to file its appeal and the state has 30 days
after that to schedule a hearing.
   ``I think what is unfortunate is that the state goes in and
talks to ex-employees, especially disgruntled employees, and comes
up with allegations,'' Ms. Trott said.
   Ms. Norris said the camp was closed because of allegations that:
   _ One camp resident was sexually assaulted by another in 1988
and a camp resident was molested by a woman staff member in 1989.
   _ Behavior-modifying drugs were administered without
prescription to students, who ranged in age from 12 to 18, to keep
them from causing trouble.

   An outraged judge sentenced two mothers to
up to 40 years in prison Friday for forcing their young children to
have sex with each other while they watched.
   Carolyn Wilson, 42, and Annette Sanford, 34, each were sentenced
to 10-40 years in prison on one count of first-degree criminal
sexual conduct for forcing Wilson's son, then 11, and Sanford's
daughter, then 9, to have sex in 1987.
   Allegan County Circuit Judge George Corsiglia also sentenced
Wilson to 20-40 years and Sanford to 18-40 years on a second rape
count in the same case.
   ``You are the most abominable and detestable example of
parenthood I have ever had the occasion to see,'' Corsiglia told
Wilson, whose 13-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter were in the
courtroom.
   ``You took our society's most precious resource and ...
destroyed their innocence for your own distorted gratification,''
he said.
   The sentences are to run concurrently. Officials said Sanford
would be eligible for parole after serving 14 years, seven months.
Wilson would be eligible for parole after 16 years, three months.
   The women also are awaiting sentencing next week for allowing
visiting men to rape their six children repeatedly between 1985 and
1988 while the two families lived together in Plainwell. The
children, now ages 9-19, testified their mothers would line them up
from youngest to oldest and let them men choose among them.
   Authorities speculate the women accepted money or drugs in
exchange for access to the children. The women, who are believed to
be half-sisters engaged in a lesbian relationship, often watched
while the men raped the children.
   ``God knows how many generations of abuse you have inflicted on
these children,'' Corsiglia said. ``Because we know abuse begets
abuse.''
   The women face up to life imprisonment for Wednesday's
convictions of first- and third-degree criminal sexual conduct, but
the prosecutor's office will recommend sentences similar to the
ones the women received Friday.
   One man has been convicted in connection with the case, but
authorities have been unable to identify others.
   The children also testified they were beaten by their mothers,
and a social worker testified the children ate from garbage cans
because they were denied food at home.
   Sanford has lost parental rights to her three daughters.
Wilson's hearing is May 25. All the children are in foster homes.
   The women, who will be in separate prisons, left the courtroom
without a word.

<HEAD>Investigators Unable to Find Cause of Fire at Former Bakker Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Investigators have been unable to
determine the cause of a fire that leveled the former home of Jim
and Tammy Bakker, authorities said Friday.
   The 10,000-square-foot lakefront mansion, which was sold in 1988
after Bakker's PTL ministry collapsed amid sex and money scandals,
burned to the ground March 9.
   The damage was so extensive that even after chemical analysis of
debris and forays by a gas-sniffing dog from Florida, the cause
couldn't be found, said Gerald Brooks, arson control officer for
the state marshal's office.
   Arson couldn't be ruled out but couldn't be substantiated,
either, he said at a news conference.
   Asked if a determination were possible, Brooks said, ``based on
the physical evidence, I don't think it can be done.''
   The home's new owner, New Jersey businessman Robert Rubino,
cooperated with investigators, Brooks said.
   The house, which at one time featured three kitchens, an
air-conditioned dog house and swan-shaped faucets, was unoccupied
when the fire broke out. The Bakkers lived there from 1981 to 1987.
   Bakker is serving a 45-year federal prison sentence for
defrauding his followers. Mrs. Bakker has begun a successor to PTL
called the New Covenant Church in Orlando, Fla.
   Rubino, who bought the home at a bankruptcy auction for
$685,000, had recently put it up for sale for $900,000.
   Though the state fire marshal's office is pulling out of the
investigation, Tega Cay Police Chief John Short said he would
continue to follow leads in the case. He declined to elaborate.

   Hundreds of armed Contra rebel troops are
defying calls for their demobilization and instead are
re-infiltrating Nicaragua, a government source says.
   The rebels, who still are receiving U.S. food aid, have slipped
back into Nicaragua from their jungle camps along the border with
Honduras since just before the country's Feb. 25 presidential
elections, said the source, who spoke Friday on condition of
anonymity.
   The Bush administration and Nicaraguan President-elect Violeta
Chamorro have repeatedly called on the Contras to disarm and
demobilize.
   U.S. officials believe the recent infiltration has swelled
numbers of rebel troops inside Nicaragua from about 3,500 to as
many as 5,000, said the source, while acknowledging the numbers are
``soft.''

   As Terry Anderson starts his sixth year as a

forgotten, Terry.''
   At a sometimes tearful, sunlit ceremony in Lafayette Park across
the street from the White House on Friday, Anderson's relatives and
fellow journalists begged his captors to release him after five
years in captivity.
   ``I don't want to punish them,'' Peggy Say said, referring to
her brother's captors. ``I don't want to hunt them down. I just
want my brother.''
   President Bush stayed away from the hour-long ceremony filled
with song and prayer, but he talked to reporters about the
hostages, sent Mrs. Say a letter and invited her to the White House
for a half-hour chat. It was the first time he had entertained a
hostage relative since he took office over a year ago.

Jerusalem a ``heavy-handed blunder'' that jeopardizes the Middle
East peace process.
   In a harsh statement issued Friday, Mitchell charged that Bush's
statement two weeks ago represented ``thoughtless insensitivity or

   ``A more heavy-handed blunder is difficult to imagine,'' said
Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Bush, at a news conference March 3 in Palm Springs, Calif.,

   Environmental claims for a variety of consumer
products _ from trash bags to hair spray _ are being investigated
by the Federal Trade Commission, which says it will ``vigorously
pursue'' deceptive advertising and packaging.
   FTC Chairman Janet Steiger said Friday the agency has joined a
task force of state attorneys general to determine whether
environmental claims made by the products can be substantiated.
   ``Consumers who buy `environmentally friendly' products in hopes
of bettering the environment cannot themselves judge whether such
products will deliver the promised benefits,'' Ms. Steiger told the
Consumer Federation of America on Friday.
   Many consumer products have appeared in stores over the past
year claiming they benefit the environment. The products range from
``degradable'' plastic trash bags, to ``ozone-friendly'' hair
spray, to diapers said to decompose in landfills.

   Opposition parties warned Saturday that East
Germany's supposedly disbanded secret police plan to prop up
Communist candidates by voting several times in the nation's first
free elections.
   About 12.2 million voters are eligible to cast ballots for a
400-seat Parliament on Sunday. With reunification likely to be
among the first issues lawmakers tackle, it could also be the
41-year-old nation's first and last free election.
   Sunday's voting will mark the full transition to democracy from
the once iron-fisted Communist rule, and help set the pace of
unification with West Germany.
   All major parties support unification, but at different paces.
Some conservative parties urge quick unification, while leftist
groups favor a more cautious approach. Most East Germans agree such
a joining is inevitable.

   Thousands of Latvians rallied in support of

political strategy Saturday on the eve of elections for new
parliaments.
   Crucial runoff elections also are planned Sunday in the Soviet
Union's vast Slavic heartland, which makes up 80 percent of the
country's territory and is home to some two-thirds of its
population.
   Most of the 1,800 races held March 4 required runoffs because no
candidate won 50 percent of the vote. Pro-democracy groups predict
they will gain a voice _ and in some areas even majorities _ in
republic parliaments and local councils.
   Latvian and Estonian popular movements hope to follow
Lithuania's lead and see their pro-independence candidates emerge
victorious in the elections. They mark the first time non-Communist
parties have competed for parliament seats in the two republics.

   Tens of thousands of Iraqi protesters
marched in the capital and other cities Saturday to express anger
at the British measures taken to censure Iraq for hanging a
London-based journalist accused of spying.
   President Saddam Hussein flew to Saudi Arabia for consultations
with King Fahd. The official Saudi Press Agency said Fahd invited
Hussein after the international uproar over the execution of Farzad
Bazoft. The 31-year-old Iranian-born journalist worked for the
Observer, a British Sunday newspaper.
   No details of their talks were released.
   The official radio said demonstrators in all major Iraqi cities
swept through the streets chanting support for Hussein's decision.
Bazoft was hanged Thursday, four days after a closed-door
revolutionary security court sentenced him to death. He denied the
charges of spying for Israel and Britain.

   A $500 million satellite that was launched
less than a month ago to spy on the Soviet Union has started
falling apart, according to a Soviet report that the Pentagon on
Saturday refused to confirm.
   The report by the Novosti news agency said four orbiting
fragments were spotted on March 7 that ``presumably separated from
the American spy satellite.''
   A U.S. space agency official said such fragments can be
non-essential pieces such as protective ``shrouds.'' But The
Washington Post said members of Congress and the intelligence
community were told the satellite had suffered a malfunction.
   There was disagreement in Washington over the impact of such a
loss of data-gathering capability, especially in light of eased
tensions between the two superpowers.
   Should the satellite or pieces of it fall toward Earth,
presumably over the Soviet Union, they most likely would
disintegrate in the atmosphere.

<TEXT>
   It took France to make lambada,
the sexy, Brazilian bump-and-grind, a smash hit in its own country.
   The truth is that lambada, dubbed ``the rage of the 1990s'' by
New York and Paris dance clubs, until recently was a backwoods jig
danced mostly by poor countryfolk in remote northeastern Brazil.
   But when it seduced Paris, Madrid and Rome, Brazilians suddenly
wanted to know what the dipping and grinding was all about.
   Now, less than a year after turning on Europe, the lambada has
become the hottest dance craze in Brazil and a strong rival to
carnival samba as the country's most popular rhythm.
   It also has whipped American filmmakers into a frenzy, with at
least three lambada movies in production. The first two, the Cannon
Pictures' production ``Lambada'' and ``The Forbidden Dance,''
produced by 21st Century Film Corp., opened March 16. Joel
Silberg's ``Lambada: The Movie'' is to be released in May.
   ``Even though its our own dance, lambada needed to conquer
Europe and the United States and get a first-world stamp of
approval before Brazilians acquired a taste for it,'' said Mauro
Trinidade, a music critic for the Rio daily Jornal do Brasil.
   Lambada, from the Portuguese verb ``to whip,'' dates as far back
as the 1920s. It first arrived on Brazil's northern coast from
radio stations in French Guyana, which intensely played Caribbean
salsa, merengue, cumbia, rumba, reggae, mambo, soca and compas
music.
   Mixed with slow native rhythms, lambada caught on in the
northern Amazon state of Para. The name came from musicians
``whipping'' their guitar strings to provide the beat.
   But the dance, performed with the man's right leg thrust between
his partner's thighs, was considered obscene and relegated to slums
and villages.
   After a right-wing military coup in 1964, the lambada became a
form of protest in northern Brazil against censorship and
repression.
   Later it moved down the coast to Bahia state, the center of
Brazilian black culture, where it gained a heavier, bolder step.
Musicians beat their drums or rudimentary percussion instruments
with their hands and combined heavier beats taken from
Afro-Brazilian dances such as carimbo, sirimbo and forro.
   After the country returned to civilian rule in 1985, the dance
got even steamier.
   Both sexes started rolling their hips in unison, yanking their
partners chest-to-chest close, and women began sliding one thigh
high up the man's hip while being dipped until her hair nearly
touched the floor.
   Indeed, when French record producers Jean Karakos and Oliver
Lorsac first saw lambada in Porto Seguro, Brazil in 1988, they
planned to market it _ as one spokesman at CBS records put it _
``as an alternative to sex in the age of AIDS.''
   They hit the right chord. Sexy lambada videos began flitting
across American and European TV screens and dance schools filled
with young people aching to learn the lambada.
   The ``queen'' of lambada is Loalwa Bras, 36, vocalist and leader
of the seven-member band and dance troupe Kaoma. Bras has netted
$12 million in royalties since 1986, when she started giving
lambada shows in Paris.
   Her latest LP, ``Worldbeat,'' released by Epic Records in June,
has already sold 6 million copies worldwide.
   Now, following a triumphant return from Europe, lambada has
Brazil's adrenaline, and cash registers, pumping.
   Rio's classiest dance clubs, such as the Hippopotamus
Discotheque, which requires black tie only, and the trendy Banana
Cafe in the beachfront neighborhood of Ipanema, are promoting
``Lambada Night'' Sundays.
   Posh nightclubs such as Rio's Canecao are packing audiences at
$15 a seat with shows by lambada singers Elba Ramalho and Beto
Barbosa. On weekends, it is common to see beachgoers gyrating to
lambada music under straw-roofed pavillions along Rio's sandy
shores.
   Four top lambada albums titled ``Dancando Lamabada,''
``Lambateria Tropical I,'' ``Lambadas Que Eu Gosto'' and
``Lambateria,'' have sold more than 1 million copies nationwide
since July.
   Carlos Santos and Geronimo, two of the hottest lambada stars
from Para state, together have sold more than 3 million records in
this nation of 150 million people.
   The boom has even inspired a new lambada fashion. For women,
lambada wear consists of black suede shoes, halter tops, glitzy
sashes, and miniskirts that fly up above the waist at the slightest
twirl, revealing string bikini underwear.
   Lambada boutiques are popping up in major cities around the
country and retailers are frantically trying to keep up with the
latest colors and fabrics.
   ``Our best sellers are black, silk miniskirts with mustard
fringes. We can't keep them on the shelves,'' said Jiojanna
Fereira, manager of the Chicletes com Banana boutique in the
southestern city of Belo Horizonte.
   Despite some puritanic grumbles, many Brazilians see the sweaty,
sensual dance as a release from economic woes and an electronic,
impersonal computer age.
   ``What you look for in lambada is not the lyrics or melody but a
sense of freedom, of celebration,'' said Lea Oliveira da Silva ,
27, a City Hall employee. ``When I'm on the dance floor, I feel
hot, like I can let myself go and not think twice about it.''

   Sometimes, Mary Freeland looks at her son
and remembers the kid who used to coast his bike down Colonel Bell
Drive to the whoops of the neighborhood gang.
   But then she looks again and reality crashes in: It's two
decades later, and he still is that child.
   It's two decades later, and Mary is back to being a full-time
mother, six years after she placed her son in a school for the
mentally retarded and began a new life. The state has run out of
money and Patrick, along with hundreds of other adults like him,
has been sent home.
   ``I'm a grandmother,'' said Mary, whose eldest daughter, Molly,
has a son. ``And I'm raising a child I'll be raising forever,
starting all over again.''
   Similar situations affect more than 63,000 families nationwide,
the U.S. Association for Retarded Citizens says.
   The future is frightening and uncertain. Everyone _ even Patrick
_ knows he needs to return to the kind of structured environment he
was forced to leave when he reached the cutoff age of 22 last June.
   In his pale, unlined face, the family sees Patrick's anger at
the separation from the residential school where friends and a
rigid routine kept him in balance.
   In his seizures and increasing violence, they witness utter
despair.
   Lately, Patrick more frequently refuses to walk and instead
folds his body into a wheelchair, deflated as much by loneliness as
by his trembling and calcified joints. Over the New Year's weekend,
he threw himself down a flight of steps. A few weeks later, he did
it again.
   ``We're watching him become more and more passive and slow. He's
not the Patrick I first met eight years ago,'' said Stephen
Freeland, who combined his two children with Mary's five when they
married in 1984.
   These people are fighters. They have coped with Patrick and
another retarded child, a 24-year-old daughter of Mary's under
state care who turned 22 before the cutoff requirement was in place.
   Together, Mary and Stephen have weathered divorce, beaten
alcoholism, overcome depression and made ends meet. They held on
after the suicide five years ago of Mary's eldest son, who would
have been 25 today.
   But watching this second son, a poster child for a mental health
organization in 1974, collapse into depression and destructive
outbursts has been too much to bear.
   ``I've lost one son already. I can't sit by and watch while I
lose another,'' said Mary, who is nearly 50. She divorced Patrick's
father a decade before he died in 1988.
   The Freelands have written letters to newspaper editors and
lobbied representatives, but it looks unlikely the state will place
Patrick in the supervised group home his family feels he needs.
   In Massachusetts, about 595 mentally retarded adults are at home
who under healthier fiscal circumstances would be provided
residential care, said Maureen Sullivan of the state Department of
Mental Retardation. Another 989 people are on day-care waiting
lists, she said.
   Parents and activists have taken their cases to the
Massachusetts courts, but haven't been able to force the state's
hand.
   The state's budget crisis forced the freeze on funding for
mentally retarded adults, and strong anti-tax sentiments have
stalled efforts to reverse the situation, said Philip Johnston,
Massachusetts secretary of human services.
   ``Patrick is falling apart because he's not getting what he
needs and I'm beginning to lose control because nothing is normal
anymore,'' Mary said.
   Nothing is normal. Family members are drawn into Patrick's
quirky world and, although they are wise to his attempts at
manipulation, it's hard to deny him the routine he relied on when
under professional care.
   ``Patrick gets things in his head, the way he wants things done
and when. He wants only certain people to get him up in the morning
and if they don't, he won't budge,'' said Stephen, whose
15-year-old son, Shane, usually is the alarm clock of choice.
   Shane's job is to roust Patrick from bed and start him dressing
while his father hunts down a razor and prepares for the ritual,
painstaking shave. Mary must be sure she has the exact cereal brand
and flavor of juice for her son, who won't eat otherwise.
   After school, 18-year-old Cathy often leaves her friends to go
home and keep an eye on Patrick, who spends hours in his upstairs
bedroom writing random names hundreds of times or endlessly
listening to the taped voices of friends lost when he left the
Cardinal Cushing School.
   Mary is trying to launch an insurance business and Stephen is
struggling to sell real estate despite the slumping local market.
But their thoughts never stray far from Patrick, who spends part of
the week at a day care center.
   This balancing act takes its toll.
   ``My son told me yesterday, `I need you to stay home with me and
be here,' '' Mary said, her voice cracking. ``And I know I should.
I know he's right. But I've got to work and I just can't care for a
6-foot-tall man 24 hours a day.''
   Stephen, a steady realist who shares with Mary a cockeyed humor
amid the tragic and absurd, picks up a lot of the slack. But even
this sturdy, bearded man has met his match in Patrick.
   ``Sometimes I feel like taking a plane out of here ... but I
love the family. I wouldn't want to be alone,'' said Stephen, a
veteran who was briefly homeless when he returned from Vietnam.
   Alcoholics Anonymous has helped the Freelands deal with drinking
problems, but they're on their own when it comes to the pressures
of life with Patrick.
   ``Support groups and outreach programs would help, but we're
barely able to give the basic services,'' said Colleen Turner, a
spokeswoman for the Association for Retarded Citizens' state
chapter. ``These families are isolated and alone.''
   On some of the toughest days, Mary crawls into bed and buries
herself in the sheets. She closes her eyes and tries to block
everything out, but Patrick is still down the hall and his pain
still comes first.
   So Mary pulls herself back together.
   ``People say I'm a survivor, and I guess I am,'' she said. ``But
how do you survive this insanity? How do you watch your child
drifting away?''

<HEAD>Asians Selling State Companies, With Mixed Results</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To many governments in the
Asia-Pacific region, selling unprofitable, inefficient state
companies to private investors seemed an ideal way to spur economic
growth or reduce debt.
   The results have been mixed, and the process is not always
smooth.
   In Indonesia, Finance Minister Johannes Sumarlin has said 215
state companies were candidates for sale, joint ventures or
liquidation, and in November listeed 52 for sale. Critics include
consumer activists, militant Moslems, intellectuals, cooperatives
and the armed forces.
   President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines, who inherited an
enormous debt and money-losing state companies in 1986, set about
getting the government out of business. The Asset Privatization
Trust has sold off enterprises worth more than $400 million.
   Singapore's Public Sector Divestment Committee recommended in
1985 that more than 500 state companies and authorities be sold.
The telecommunications authority, with a possible market
capitalization equivalent to $5.4 billion, is expected to be
private and listed on the stock exchange by 1992 or 1993.
   Taiwan has plans to put 19 of its 45 state enterprises in
private hands. All 45 have more than 200,000 employees and account
for up to 30 percent of total output.
   In Pakistan, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said last year her
country would follow Britain's lead in selling stock in state-run
industries to achieve broad-based ownership.
   Japan started offering shares in the telecommunications giant
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone four years ago.
   South Korea's generally successful divestment program includes
the largest steel producer, other manufacturers, banks, utilities
and trading firms.
   Nowhere was the goal of privatization given greater priority
than in Malaysia.
   Seven years after the program was announced, however, only 21
government operations have gone private through direct sale of
existing assets, public listing on the stock exchange, management
contracts or temporary ownership arrangments.
   They include the national airline, a lottery, public utilities,
shipping companies, highway construction projects, a television
station and removal of garbage from Kuala Lumpur City Hall.
   Plans call for electric power and the railroads to move toward
private ownership this year. Senior officials talk for the first
time, however, of poor progress, red tape, the need for a master
plan and lack of enthusiasm among civil servants.
   ``Lack of understanding of the policy'' hampers privatization
and it has not been carried out well, Finance Minister Daim
Zainuddin said.
   Too many civil servants are unsure of the objectives and
methods, Daim said in a recent speech, but ``this problem is being
overcome. ... The government has already prepared a privatization
master plan.''
   Other officials cite resistance by labor unions, legal and
financial obstacles, administrative problems and accusations of
political favoritism.
   Daim said the government once provided the equivalent of $10.7
billion in loan guarantees for about 1,000 state companies. At
least 246 were tagged for sale out of 434 studied by a team of
foreign and domestic merchant bankers.
   Conversion of the railroads is expected to be the big test. The
6,000-member Railwaysmen's Union of Malaya has pledged to fight.
   ``How can we accept commercialization of any sort when even in
an advanced country like Japan, the system has cost the removal of
75,000 railway workers?'' said union leader Abdul Gaffoor Ibrahim.
   Malaysia's narrow-gauge, single-track system was offered for
sale in 1986 for a token 1 ringgit (37 cents) in hopes private
owners would improve service and achieve profitability. There were
no takers.
   Labor opposition also delays an ambitious program in neighboring
Thailand, where planners saw denationalization as a cure for
inefficiency and an overburdened infrastructure.
   About 5,800 port workers struck three times in six months
against a government decision to let private firms operate at least
part of a new deep-sea container port at Laem Chabang, 80 miles
south of Bangkok.
   Hong Kong has put its port, water supplies, post office, civil
aviation and other essential services in private hands, but the
British crown colony reverts in 1997 to control by China, which has
rejected private ownership.
   ``Political regimes that are based on privatized economies breed
all forms of corruption,'' the Chinese Communist Party newspaper
People's Daily said in December.
   Public ownership has become ``an irreversible trend,'' it said,
and declared: ``Capitalist privatization determines that the
capitalist gets the bigger interest and thus the workers become the
depressed and exploited.''

<HEAD>Academy Tickets Can Be Harder to Snag Than An Oscar</HEAD>

   And you thought fitting into one of those gold
lame dresses on Oscar night was tough. Try slipping into this
year's Academy Awards show. Now that's a tight squeeze.
   After two years at the spacious Shrine Auditorium, the 62nd
Annual Academy Awards show is moving back to the more elegant but
cramped Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, which has nearly 3,000 fewer
seats.
   With dozens of chairs removed for television cameras, only 2,990
are left for the black-tie audience. As a result, this year's Oscar
tickets have become the hottest property in town.
   About half of the remaining seats are reserved for members of
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Other blocks go to
advertisers on the ABC telecast, performers, presenters, guests,
press and the Academy's Board of governors.
   Nominees are invited, but they should forget about bringing
their family and friends.
   Phil Alden Robinson, the writer-director of best-picture
candidate ``Field of Dreams,'' has only two seats _ for himself and
a date. His parents, who are coming to Los Angeles from Florida for
the awards, still don't have tickets, and his mother even bought a
new dress for the occasion.
   ``Last year, I heard all nominees could get four tickets,''
Robinson said. ``Now it's down to two tickets. It's brutal.''
   However, Oliver Stone, whose ``Born on the Fourth of July'' is
up for eight Oscars including best picture, asked for _ and
received _ two extra tickets. But one of Stone's agents, Mike
Menchel, wasn't so lucky. Less than two weeks before the gala,
Menchel was working the phones trying to score an extra pair of
seats.
   The real battle is being waged among midlevel studio executives,
who consider Academy Award tickets to be a Hollywood status symbol.
   Tickets for the post-telecast Governor's Ball are impossible to
find, too.
   Major studios such as the Walt Disney Co. and Paramount Pictures
all receive 20 seats. Independent film companies are given between
six and 12 tickets each. ``So you have a company with 1,500
employees, and 30 or more of those people have the title of vice
president or higher, and they want to bring dates,'' said one
studio publicist. ``All of a sudden, you have 60 people clamoring
for 20 seats. It's obscene.''
   Said one executive at Universal Pictures: ``It's going to be
very hard for a lot of people here because we have so many
nominated films. We have 17 nominations, and the creative people
from all the films want to go.''
   Most won't be able to. ``The tickets won't filter down like they
did last year,'' the Universal executive said.
   The ticket crunch has become so intense that the Academy has
been unable to fill hundreds of orders from the Academy's 5,300
members. ``We've got a lot of enemies,'' said Oscar spokesman Bob
Werden.
   Top Oscar seats _ costing $200 apiece _ sold out the first day,
with 272 requests denied that day, said Otto Spoerri, the Academy's
controller. Last year, he said, every member's order was filled.
   The Oscars are no stranger to downtown's Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion, site of the awards ceremony from 1969 to 1987. In 1988,
because of increasing interest in the Oscar pageant, the show was
moved to the larger Shrine, five miles south.
   While the cavernous facility accommodated more guests, traffic
was a mess and the surrounding neighborhood not much better.
   So it's back to the Chandler this year. But not to worry. The
Academy plans to return to the Shrine again next year.
   This year, the Academy was forced to place an ad in the trade
newspaper Daily Variety, encouraging members to attend one of the
many unofficial Oscar night parties around town rather than pester
the Academy for non-existent show tickets. Six Academy staffers
field ticket-related calls all day, every day.
   ``We'd be enormously grateful ... if each of you would resist
making that phone call to which we'd only have to say `no,''' the
ad read.
   Some members are scalping their seats _ and the Academy is
trying to track down the malefactors. A member caught selling
tickets is banned from all future Oscar seat purchases, Spoerri
said.
   Murray's Tickets, which once scalped seats for a mass given by
Pope John Paul II at Dodger Stadium, is selling Oscar seats for as
much as $2,500 apiece.
   ``This year it's hot,'' said the firm's Lance Keller. ``It's not
a high-volume thing, but the prices are high.'' The cheapest seat
Murray's is selling costs $650.
   Movie fans and frustrated entertainers are the worst off. Louis
Valentine, a pianist who thinks he can find his big break at the
Oscar show, placed a classified ad asking for show tickets.
   ``I just want to see what it's like and meet people. I've tried
everything possible to get into the business,'' Valentine said.
``So far, I've got three calls from my ad. And the prices were
unbelievable.
   ``The cheapest was $700 for one ticket. I can't go higher than
$300. Or maybe $350, max.''

<BYLINE>Tom Brokaw Does Special on New Hollywood, Also Reflects on Network
News
^By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There was a time when they used to drive
convertibles in Hollywood. Now they drive convertible debentures.
And Laurel and Hardy have been replaced by a new team, Mergers &amp;
Acquisitions.
   The effects of this march of the conglomerates on the movie
world are being examined Wednesday in an NBC News special, ``The
New Hollywood.'' It's anchored by Tom Brokaw, who can recall the
remnants of the Old Hollywood.
   He first saw it in 1966, when he began at NBC-owned KNBC-TV in
Burbank as the new anchor in town. He came in contact with assorted
Hollywood folk _ stars, agents, apprentice moguls, and their close
personal friends.
   His memories: ``In those days, it seemed more stately than it
does now. Maybe I'm deluding myself, but it seemed to me there was
at least a residue of the old elegance of Hollywood. Now it's
Hustle City.''
   When he was new in town, he recalls, assorted sages ``were
predicting that the era of the big studios was over, that they were
going to roll over and die, and the little independent films were
taking hold in many ways.''
   Well, not even sages can be right all the time.
   The ``conglomerization'' of Hollywood has tended to make the
talk there guarded, cautious and corporate, a far cry from
yesteryear's lavish babble.
   Thus, Brokaw says, he was surprised that today's Hollywood
inmates, including Oscar candidate director-writer Oliver Stone,
were willing to talk to him about the New Hollywood and its
bottom-line brigade.
   But he drew a blank with one of hamlet's major movers and
shakers, Michael Ovitz, a party often identified as a superagent
who handles superstars.
   Brokaw said he talked by phone with Ovitz, chairman of Creative
Artists Agency, ``and he simply would not cooperate. Mike Ovitz
said he would be happy to talk to me off the record if I wouldn't
tell anybody that we were talking. So I thought I'd pass.''
   The ``NBC Nightly News'' anchorman, like his rivals at CBS and
ABC, has been concerned with more serious matters in recent years _
the loss of audience to cable and independent stations.
   True, ABC's ``World News Tonight'' has risen to a consistent
first in the ratings and increased its audence. But in the most
recent Nielsens, for the week ending March 11, the major network
newscasts had only a combined 58 percent share of the audience.
   The common problem, Brokaw says, is that ``there's no longer a
level playing field anywhere in the country.'' Network newcasts are
being shifted around by local affiliates, battling game shows and
syndicated sort-of news shows where formerly they battled each
other or local newscasts.
   Where will all this lead the network newscasts?
   ``Well, you hope they survive,'' he says. ``But I do think we've
got to get out of the half-hour format'' and go to an hour format
in early evenings. Network affiliates have resisted such proposals
for years.
   Brokaw says he thinks they're going to have to work out some
cooperative arrangement with the networks ``because these
affiliates are now in the same boat with us.''
   ``They're competing with an even greater cable penetration
around the country'' _ cable now is in more than 57 percent of the
nation's TV households _ ``and with independent stations, and next
year, with a Fox (network) newscast. They're going to have to do
something.''
   He's been proposing a one-hour, two-part ``NBC Nightly News'' as
a possible solution. The first part, he says, would entail ``doing
pretty much what we're doing now,'' hard news, investigative
reports and the like.
   What he calls Page Two of the broadcast, its second half-hour,
would have ``more back-of-the-book kinds of stuff,'' features,
profiles of various newsmakers, and what's generally known as soft
news.
   However, Brokaw says, such a two-part broadcast isn't under
active consideration at NBC News.
   ``No, I think it's fair to say that it's on the back burner,''
he says.
   It may be discussed at the annual NBC affiliates convention in
June in Washington, D.C., he says. Any plans to urge them to accept
the idea?
   ``Not that I know of,'' Brokaw said.

   OSCAR FEVER _ THE PREQUEL: NBC's ``Today'' show is heading to
Hollywood this week. Even though ABC will air next Monday's Oscar
Awards show, ``Today'' will report on Oscar fever, entertainment
and lesser matters in Los Angeles. Its reports will start Wednesday
and continue through March 27.
   ABC's Oscar awards show will be preceded by a Barbara Walters

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus May Prove Wrong Target for U.S.</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is on vacation.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Is Japan's trade surplus destined for the dustbin
of the U.S.-Japan agenda?
   With the broadest measure of Japan's financial flows already in
the red and other major indicators plunging, some observers think
the United States is mistaken to focus on eliminating its trade
deficit with the Japanese.
   While no one expects balanced trade between the world's top two
economies, some are predicting Japan soon will run a deficit with
the world at large and, more important, that the challenge
presented by its industries and trade practices could be stronger
than ever.
   Bill Emmott, former Tokyo bureau chief for The Economist
magazine, forecasts that Japan's current account surplus, the broad
measure of merchandise trade, services and tourism, will dwindle by
the end of the decade, possibly much sooner.
   ``Japan's economy is passing through a phase of imbalance with
the world that will soon be righted,'' Emmott writes in his
recently published book, ``The Sun Also Sets: The Limits to Japan's
Economic Power.''
   In January the current account fell into deficit for the first
time in four years, showing a $636 million shortfall vs. a $2.5
billion surplus in January 1989.
   The Japanese economy appears to have slipped its leash. The
stock market and yen are falling. Interest rates, exceptionally low
in the late 1980s, are leaping.
   The Bank of Japan's effort to prop up the yen has drained
Japan's foreign reserves from $100 billion last April to $80
billion in February.
   William H. Brown, president of the investment advisory firm
Scudder Stevens and Clark Japan, said the financial markets were
responding to ``changes taking place that were not anticipated at
the end of last year. ... The U.S. economy is a lot better than we
had expected. The slight improvement in the (U.S.) trade deficit is
partly a result.''
   But he warned that it was too early to tell whether ``tectonic
plate shifts'' in the U.S.-Japanese economic relationship were
taking place.
   Indeed, the weak yen is expected to cause a resurgence of
Japanese exports later this year. But the more durable trend is
downward, said several observers.
   The merchandise trade surplus fell for the 10th straight month
in February, to $5 billion, down 30 percent from a year earlier.
   ``Japan will have a trade deficit in the future,'' said U.S.
businessman Joseph A. Grimes, president of Hill and Knowlton Japan.
``With all its investment overseas, (a continuing surplus) doesn't
mathematically work out.''
   The reversal appears to stem from market factors such as strong
domestic demand and higher world oil prices, not official measures
demanded by Washington to widen access to Japan's market.
   February imports rose nearly 12 percent to $16.9 billion. By
comparison, the government's import promotion plan, unveiled with
much fanfare at the beginning of the year, promises to increase
imports by only about $3 billion a year.
   Americans who focus on the trade deficit with Japan are
``missing the real target of trade policy,'' Emmott said.
   Instead, he said, the United States should ``whack the Japanese
over the head'' about unfair trade practices in specific industries.
   Grimes expressed concern that the U.S. government will lose
interest in fighting trade barriers if the deficit dwindles.
   ``I jokingly tell business chambers, `You ought to be glad
there's a trade deficit.'''
   Fortunately for U.S. businessmen overseas, the U.S.-Japanese
trade imbalance is expected to persist even if Japan goes into
deficit overall, because Japan has to import raw materials, which
it can only do by exporting finished products to the United States
and other developed markets.
   ``The idea,'' said Grimes, ``is to get it down to a workable
level, perhaps in the range of $20 billion.'' In 1989 Japan had a
surplus of $49 billion in trade with the United States.
   A Japan without an overall trade surplus still would represent a
formidable economic challenge, Emmott said, because of its overseas
production bases.
   Leon Hollerman, author of ``Japan Disincorporated: The Economic
Liberalization Process'' also suggests Japan is evolving into an
international ``headquarters country.''

<HEAD>Young Economist To Steer Brazil's Shattered Economy
^By STAN LEHMAN
^Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 36-year-old financial consultant and
former economics professor has been given the job of steering
Brazil, the largest nation in Latin America, out of its worst
economic crisis.
   Zelia Cardoso de Mello, a champion of free markets, heads the
new Economics Ministry created by combining the finance, commerce
and planning and industry portfolios. It is the most powerful post
in the Cabinet.
   When President Fernando Collor de Mello appointed her, he said:
``The success of my administration depends on you. Good luck,
Professor Zelia, and may God help us.'' His government took office
last week.
   Cardoso de Mello, who is not related to the president, is
confronted by an inflation rate of more than 70 percent a month and
the largest foreign debt in the developing world.
   After the new government was installed, she announced austerity
measures that include increased taxes, a severe tightening of the
money supply, sale of state enterprises, a sharp reduction in
government spending and an end to all subsidies and tax incentives.
   She said taxes would be imposed on capital gains and
agriculture. Banks and other financial institutions will be forced
to buy new ``privatization certificates'' to hasten the sale of
poorly run, money-losing state companies to private investors.
   Anonymous interest-bearing accounts used for illicit or
undeclared income were banned. The minister said owners of such
accounts will have to identify themselves and justify the deposits
or pay a 25 percent tax on them.
   A newspaper profile described Cardoso de Mello as a ``discreet
and methodical woman who strongly defends her ideas and interests.''
   She holds a doctorate in economics from the University of Sao
Paulo, where she taught world and Brazilian economic history.
   Andre Franco Montoro made Cardoso de Mello administrative
director of the Sao Paulo Housing Development Agency in 1983, when
he was governor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's most populous and industrial
state.
   He now leads the left-of-center Brazilian Social Democracy
Party, and said recently: ``There are few people as prepared as she
is to be minister of the economy.''
   Cardoso de Mello held a midlevel Finance Ministry job in
1986-87, analyzing federal investment and loan programs for the
states. That was when she met Collor, who was governor of
northeastern Alagoas and sought help in renegotiating the state's
debt to the federal government.
   When she left the government to set up her own consulting firm,
Collor's state administration was among her first clients. Cardoso
de Mello has been his chief economic adviser since he announced his
presidential candidacy early last year.
   Andrea Calabi, once her professor and later her boss in the
Finance Ministry, said experience in government and consulting gave
Cardoso de Mello a thorough knowledge of productivity, cost
reduction, interest rates, industrial growth, employment and debt
renegotiation.
   ``She will bring to the new government a very rare and positive
blend of practical, historical and theoretical knowledge of
economic and financial matters that definitely qualify her for the
ministry,'' Calabi said.
   Among Brazil's problems are raging inflation; a foreign debt of
$114 billion, largest in the developing world; an internal debt of
at least $100 billion; a bloated and inefficient government
bureaucracy, and a host of state-owned companies that are losing
money.
   On March 2, the day after her appointment, Cardoso de Mello told
a news conference proposed to increase taxes, collect them, reduce
the size of government, sell off state companies and renegotiate
the Brazil's debts.
   ``With these measures, we believe inflation will drop,'' she
declared.
   Brazil will commit a portion of its $303 billion gross national
product to pay the debts, but will not sacrifice economic growth,
she said.
   Collor has pledged that inflation will be down to 10 percent a
month when he has been in office 100 days. None of the economists
interviewed would comment on his chances of being right.
   Raul Czarny, a University of Sao Paulo economist, said Brazil
was in a ``now-or-never situation'' and Cardoso de Mello's ability
to deal with it would ``depend on the public and political support
she can muster for her ideas.''

   In the city where lawyers and accountants are
king, even the environmentalists wear gray flannel suits.
   Not so at Conservation International, where some brash, young
biologists who prefer jeans and khakis are running what they call
``a lean, mean conservation machine.''
   Since its founding in January 1987, Conservation International
has scored a string of rapid-fire successes.
   In July 1987, it executed the first debt-for-nature swap,
purchasing and forgiving $650,000 of Bolivia's foreign debt in
exchange for the country's establishment of a wildlife preserve
within its borders.
   Others had been talking about debt swaps for three years.
Conservation International put the first deal together when it was
only 6 months old.
   The group has tapped new sources of funds, enlisting such
unorthodox environmental advocates as the ``material girl,''
Madonna, who raised $200,000 last year with her ``Don't Bungle the
Jungle'' concert in Brooklyn, and Bergdorf Goodman, which donated
$50,000 from a benefit fashion show last October.
   The organization has established a conservation program in the
Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif on the coast of Colombia, where
government officials, campesinos and Indians maintain an uneasy
co-existence with guerillas and drug-runners.
   When the area's drug lords were convinced the field workers were
not from the CIA or setting up a competitive operation, they
allowed the program to continue.
   ``It's a classic example of how you can do conservation
anywhere,'' says Conservation International's president, Russell
Mittermeier.
   ``CI reminds me of the Peace Corps in its early days, when it
was led by Sargent Shriver and it was thought that nothing was
undoable,'' says Patricia Kelly, vice president for communications
and a former Peace Corps volunteer.
   This spring, Conservation International will dispatch
environmental ``SWAT teams'' to assess urgent conservation needs in
eastern Paraguay and northern Bolivia, and will participate in the
April 22 celebration of the 20th anniversary of Earth Day with the
construction of a rain forest in a tent on the Mall in Washington,
D.C.
   The man responsible for much of this activity is Mittermeier,
40, a wildlife biologist with 20 years' experience in the tropics.
   A recent Conservation International report pictures him emerging
from a swamp in Suriname, covered with mud up to his neck holding a
wriggling Pipa pipa, or Suriname toad.
   ``We have a motto: `Heads in the sky, feet in the mud,''' says
Peter Seligmann, the board chairman and key fundraiser, who also is
trained in biology.
   Mittermeier has published more than 200 scientific papers, and
speaks six languages, including Surinamese. In 1974, he
rediscovered the yellow-tailed woolly monkey in Peru, decades after
experts had decided it probably was extinct. A magazine article
dubbed him ``Russell of the Apes.''
   When he joined Conservation International last May, leaving a
post as vice president for science at the World Wildlife Fund, he
brought half a dozen other Fund scientists with him, including
long-time colleague Mark Plotkin, an authority on medicinal uses of
the rain forest.
   They joined a staff of 50, most of whom had made up the
international program at The Nature Conservancy until January 1987,
when a policy dispute led to a bitter split between the
international and domestic programs.
   Mittermeier's office is appointed in a style that might be
called Early Smithsonian. Spears decorate one wall. Giant masks and
carved deities stare back from another. Boxes of slides and piles
of scientific monographs cover his desk, a large table and most of
the floor.
   ``Two things set us apart from other conservation
organizations,'' Mittermeier says.
   One is a reliance on local conservationists to run the programs
abroad.
   Sixty percent of Conservation International's staff is Latin
American. The hallways echo with the sounds of Spanish, Portuguese,
Surinamese and Malagasy, the language of Madagascar.
   The second distinguishing feature, Mittermeier says, is its
strong scientific base, as exemplified by the conservation SWAT
teams.
   ``We're sending these guys out to spend a couple of weeks and
get an assessment of priorities,'' he says. ``That's going to help
us make sure we're focusing our money on the right things.''
   The teams will be made up of some of the world's best field
biologists, Mittermeier says. One is Theodore Parker, a recently
hired ornithologist.
   ``He can go into an area and identify 90 percent of the birds in
two days,'' Mittermeier says. ``Not only by sightings. He can do it
by sound. He's got an incredible ear.''
   Scientists like Parker ``can do in a couple of weeks what can
take an ordinary scientist several years,'' says Mittermeier, who
plans to pay well for that expertise. ``The biologists should be
paid at least as much as the lawyers and accountants.''
   In January, Conservation International issued its master
conservation plan for the 1990s, called ``The Rainforest
Imperative.'' The report sets priorities in 10 tropical hotspots
where urgent action is needed and in the five largest remaining
pieces of tropical wilderness.
   Many of these occur in the 12 nations Mittermeier calls
``megadiversity'' countries because together they contain 60
percent of the world's plant and animal species, more animal and
plant diversity than is found anywhere else.
   Conservation International has established, or is planning,
conservation programs in nearly all of these places.
   ``Over the next decade, we have to approach the conservation of
biological diversity at the same level of intensity, dedication,
devotion and investment with which we approached the race to the
moon,'' Mittermeier says.

   Aside from his home video work, it was surely
Rob Lowe's most inept performance.
   Opening the Oscar telecast a year ago, an atonal Lowe and a
phony Snow White labored through their own rendition of ``Proud
Mary.'' In the background, a dancer bobbed under the weight of a
huge headdress resembling Hollywood's landmark Chinese Theater.
   The rest of the show _ produced by campmeister Allan Carr _ was
so rude that when the curtain finally fell, 17 industry figures
pounded out an angry note to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences.
   Signed by such luminaries as Paul Newman and Gregory Peck, the
letter attacked the broadcast as ``an embarrassment to both the
Academy and the entire motion picture industry,'' even though it
was a ratings hit.
   Lowe's worst moment came when his sex video was made public.
While attending the Democratic National Convention in 1988, he made
a videotape of sex involving himself and two young women in his
Atlanta hotel room. Claims and counterclaims rebounded, and Lowe
agreed to do 20 hours of community service to avoid prosecution for
allegedly seducing one of the women, then a 16-year-old. Her
mother's suit against Lowe is pending.
   Meanwhile, Walt Disney Co. brought a federal trademark
infringement suit against the Academy, claiming the Snow White
impostor (actress Eileen Bowman) also diluted the character's
value. The suit was filed after the Academy refused to apologize
for the unusual use of Snow White, and was dropped a week later
when the Academy apologized.
   Will this year's 62nd annual Academy Awards program on Monday
night draw similar catcalls and problems?
   Gilbert Cates, the producer of the show, has been hired to make
sure the only groans heard in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion will be
made by chair hinges as Oscar guests jump up for standing ovations.
   Unlike Carr, who celebrated Hollywood glitz by showcasing young
Hollywood ``stars'' like Matt Lattanzi and Savion Glover in an
endless song-and-dance routine, Cates plans to focus this year's
program on the global film community.
   The broadcast will include satellite feeds from companion Oscar
parties in Moscow, Sydney, Australia, Tokyo, London and Buenos
Aires, Argentina, with awards announced in all except Tokyo.
   ``Each show is a kind of historical document,'' Cates said after
viewing 25 Oscar telecasts to prepare for this year's event. The
1990 show, he decided, should reflect the exploding international
market for movies as well as the political changes sweeping the
world.
   ``I hope that we get a sense of the fact that the world is
smaller, and by showing the international nature of the film
industry that we're all really interdependent on one another,'' he
said.
   This year, besides the five nominees for best foreign film,
overseas contenders include: ``My Left Foot'' from Ireland, five
nominations including best picture; Camille Claudel'' from France,
two nominations including best foreign film; and ``Henry V'' from
England, three nominations including best director.
   The program, which Cates said will run longer than 3 hours, will
be seen by about 1 billion people in more than 90 countries. The
director is Jeff Margolis, whose credits include ``Happy Birthday,
Hollywood'' and seven ``American Music Awards'' presentations.
   ``This is a monster,'' Margolis said. ``My first thought was,
`How are we going to put this together?' ... It's been a scheduling
nightmare because of the time differences.'' When the ceremony
begins at 6 p.m. in Los Angeles, it will be 5 a.m. in Moscow and 3
a.m. in London.
   Carr's show continues to haunt the Academy, but Cates is
confident his more tasteful approach can push recent history out of
memory.
   ``I think that everybody who's involved in this show is here
without reference to the past show,'' he said. ``I get asked about
Allan Carr a lot. And I always said what I think is true: He worked
very hard, he did the best show that he could and it's very easy to
Monday-morning quarterback.
   ``The truth of the matter is that if these satellites work out
well, we'll all be heroes on Tuesday. If two of them crap out,
people will say, `What a stupid idea, why would anyone try it?'
   ``So you're really at the mercy of a lot of things you don't
control.''
   For the first time, envelopes with the names of winners will be
unsealed outside the United States. Price Waterhouse will send
bonded couriers to each foreign venue bearing envelopes with every
possible winner.
   Each envelope will have a code on the outside and when the big
moment comes, the accounting firm will then tell the overseas
presenters which marked envelope to open.
   ``There are certainly possibilities for things to go awry,''
said Price Waterhouse's Dan Lyle. ``But they won't.''
   The art direction award will be announced in London, two
documentary prizes will be revealed in Buenos Aires, the
foreign-language winner will be made known in Moscow and sound and
sound effects editing will be announced in Sydney. Winners will be
in Los Angeles.
   Cates said the international segments of his Oscar presentation
should consume about 20 minutes of show time. The rest of the
broadcast will be dedicated to the awarding of prizes and
performances of nominated songs.
   ``I think this institution has gone back to our earliest
childhood,'' he said. ``Most people knew about the Academy Awards
when they were 3, 4 and 5 years old. And they've been kind of
watching every year.
   ``There are very few annual events. It's almost like a national
holiday in a way. It's like Labor Day, the Fourth of July. People
watch the Academy Awards show.''

   Investors hoping for higher stock prices say
their optimism only increases these days when they see how
un-bullish mutual fund managers have become.
   If history is any guide, they proclaim, the chances for a rising
market get better and better the more the funds build up their cash
reserves against the possibility of a decline.
   In recent months the funds have been doing just that. According
to the Investment Company Institute, the industry's biggest trade
group, stock funds had 11.5 percent of their assets in cash at the
end of January.
   That was up from 10.4 percent a month earlier and 9.4 percent in
January 1989.
   The latest reading has been equaled or exceeded only a few times
over the 36 years statistics have been maintained on the subject,
notes Norman Fosback, editor of the investment advisory letter
Smart Money.
   Each time it got that high in the past, the stock market chalked
up a healthy gain over the next 12 months, he says.
   At the end of July 1970, for example, the percentage of fund
assets in cash _ that is, parked in short-term money market
investments like Treasury bills and commercial paper issued by
corporations _ reached 11.8.
   Over the ensuing year, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock composite
index rose 22 percent.
   The cash ratio hit 12.7 percent in September 1974, following
which the S&amp;P 500 staged a one-year advance of 32 percent.
   On June 30, 1982, fund cash stood at 11.7 percent, shortly
before the start of a dramatic rally that pushed the S&amp;P 500 up 53
percent by mid-1983.
   The cash ratio climbed back to 11.1 percent in November 1987,
just after Wall Street's Black Monday. That was followed by a 19
percent rally over the next 12 months.
   ``Today's market is clearly dominated by institutional
investors,'' Fosback says. ``Consequently, when the `big boys' are
loaded with cash, the market can prospectively benefit from their
buying power.
   ``Furthermore, most institutional investors are even more
emotional than individual investors when it comes to following the
prevailing trend. They tend to rush into the market in response to
rising prices and to vacate the market during times of widespread
panic selling.
   ``As a result, they are most fully invested in stocks (and hold
the lowest cash reserves) right at the top of a cycle, and have
their smallest commitment to stocks (and the biggest cash reserves)
right at the bottom before big upmoves.''
   Of course, it can be argued that people who run stock mutual
funds have a greater incentive to maintain cash reserves now than
they did in bygone times, when yields available in money market
investments were small to negligible.
   Today, when ``cash'' earns returns of 7 percent to 8 percent,
managers can't buy stocks just for, say, their dividend yields of 3
percent or 4 percent.
   But, Fosback says, even if you run a computer calculation
factoring in differences in interest rates, the funds' cash
reserves are as high now as they have been at any time in recent
history.
   He concludes: ``The funds have seldom in the past held large
excess cash levels and been proven right by falling prices. We
expect them to be wrong again this time.''

<HEAD>Future Princess Becomes Leading Celebrity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Her engagement to Prince Aya, son of Emperor
Akihito, has transformed Kiko Kawashima from an unknown professor's
daughter into one of Japan's leading celebrities.
   The sudden popularity of the 24-year-old graduate student is
most evident in women's magazines and afternoon television talk
shows, where she is affectionately called ``Kiko-san.''
   ``Young women feel close to her,'' said a reporter for the
gossipy magazine Josei Seven. ``She has a special warmth and
cuteness, and women look forward to her wedding as a kind of royal
extravaganza.''
   The reporter, who insisted on anonymity, said the future
princess had created a quiet boom in the sales of subdued, orthodox
fashions because women were imitating the ``Kiko look.''
   Sales of ``Travels of the Heart,'' an introductory text in
psychology written by Mieko Kamiya, have soared since a magazine
said it was Miss Kawashima's favorite book.
   About 75,000 copies had been sold between its publication in
1975 and September, when the article appeared. The publishers have
printed 55,000 more and expect to sell at least 200,000 by the
wedding in late June of Kiko and Aya, also 24, who is second in
line to the throne.
   ``I think it's safe to say sales are up because of the
connection to Miss Kawashima,'' said Chikao Iso, advertising
director of Nihon Hyoronsha, one of the book's two publishers.
``It's not an easy book to read.''
   Magazines may make her the stuff of dreams and throngs of
admirers may seek a glimpse of the ``Kiko smile,'' but Miss
Kawashima, a commoner, has learned that not even a prince's
betrothed is exempt from criticism.
   An article in the Sunday Mainichi magazine said the old
aristocracy considered her an outsider.
   Quoting a woman aristocrat it did not name, the magazine said
Miss Kawashima was frowned upon for ``flapping about too much'' _
waving to her admirers and shaking the outstretched hands she
encounters everywhere.
   ``It is absolutely too much,'' the woman was quoted as saying.
``She may be the prince's fiancee, but she is not a princess yet.
She's just a common person.''
   Most members of the aristocracy were stripped of their titles
after World War II, but many have preserved a close-knit society
and have strong ties to the imperial palace.
   Empress Michiko, who will be Miss Kawashima's mother-in-law, was
the first commoner to marry into the royal family. She is said to
have suffered pyschological bullying from palace attendants and
chamberlains, who are trained to revere and protect the
Chrysanthemum Throne's ancient traditions.
   Michiko was the daughter of a wealthy businessman, however, and
accustomed to wealth and social position. Miss Kawashima's father
is of much humble means.
   Aya and Kiko met as university students and came to know each
other through a shared interest in nature. She was studying
psychology in graduate school when he proposed in September.
   Recognizing the difficulties Miss Kawashima will face, the
Imperial Household Agency, a government bureau that manages palace
affairs, hired tutors to help prepare her for royal life in an
eight-course ``princess education.'' ``Women may admire Kiko-san,
but they wouldn't want to take her place,'' said the reporter for
Josei Seven. ``They ... know the life of a princess is not like
what you read in fairy tales.''

<HEAD>Government Falls Silent on Noise Pollution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The infernal racket of urban life can drive
you crazy, but there's only one person left at the Environmental
Protection Agency who can hear your complaints above the din.
   EPA scientist Kenneth E. Feith is the guy who picks up the phone
and listens to lamentations about noisy trucks and trash
compactors, shrieking jet planes and the banshee howl of the
neighbor's lawnmower.
   Feith, 58, says he is the ``institutional memory'' of the EPA's
Office of Noise Abatement and Control, which once boasted a $10
million budget and more than 100 employees working to make America
quieter and saner.
   The office went out of businesss in 1982, the victim of
President Reagan's budget-cutting deregulation campaign. It now
ranks as a ``non-program'' without budget or staff.
   Feith, who once wrote the EPA's anti-noise regulations, has
other duties today, but he answers a couple of dozen phone calls
about noise pollution every week as a courtesy to the public.
   ``I do this almost out of my hip pocket,'' he says.
   The noise, meanwhile, hasn't gone away. If anything, it's
getting worse. Experts estimate that more than 20 million Americans
are exposed daily to noise loud enough to cause permanent loss of
hearing during a working lifetime.
   That level is above 80 decibels, about the intensity of noise
produced by a vacuum cleaner or electrical tools.
   Studies also show that the stress of loud, sustained noise can
cause high blood pressure, ulcers, headaches, insomnia, respiratory
ailments, learning difficulties among children, job absenteeism,
anxiety, irritability and anti-social behavior.
   If the bells of Notre Dame drove poor Quasimodo nearly mad, the
decibels are still giving us fits. To wit:
   _A 69-year-old man living in a trailer home under a noisy
airport flight path was arrested recently in Llano, Calif., after
he allegedly took a 4-foot mirror outside and tried to blind pilots
with reflected sunlight.
   _An angry Bavarian mounted a catapult in his front yard and
launched his wife's homemade dumplings at low-flying jet fighters
from a nearby military base.
   _A Japanese apartment dweller, distraught that a young girl
ignored his repeated complaints about her loud piano playing, went
next door and stabbed the girl, her sister and her mother.
   _A woman was taken into custody in New York City for allegedly
aiming a double-barreled shotgun at a maintenance worker outside
her window, complaining that he was disturbing her and her pets.
   The aggravation may get worse before it gets better, says Dr.
Alice H. Suter, a research audiologist at the National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health and a leading expert on noise
pollution.
   ``My guess is that it's somewhat noisier than it used to be,''
she said in a telephone interview from her office in Cincinnati.
   ``The newly manufactured jet planes and heavy trucks are
quieter, but the overall amount of noise is greater just because
there's more of everything _ construction, planes, traffic,'' she
said.
   Ms. Suter said lack of money has prevented accurate measurement
of increased noise levels. The demise of the EPA's noise office
also meant that the pipeline of federal money for research and
technical assistance to states and localities dried up.
   As a result, only 15 state and local anti-noise programs are
still active, compared with 1,100 in the mid-1970s when noise
pollution was a popular environmental cause.
   The EPA's anti-noise regulations remain in effect for trains,
heavy trucks, railroad coupling and switching equipment, air
compressors, motorcycles and labeling of earplugs, but there's
virtually no one to enforce them.
   Meanwhile, despite improved truck exhaust mufflers and highway
sound barriers, vehicular traffic still ranks as the worst
offender. Another source of potentially damaging noise is the
typical American home with its leaf blowers, mowers, power tools,
food blenders, dishwashers and laundry machines, Feith said.
   The experts say noise pollution is easily ignored in an
industrial society concerned with oil spills, garbage, smog and
other more visible forms of pollution, but they say it is no less
hazardous to health.
   ``There's never been a Greenpeace or a Sierra Club for noise,''
Feith said.
   ``People don't get as excited about noise as they do about
cancer-causing agents in the environment. Noise doesn't leave
bodies in the streets. But it can cause physical, emotional and
psychological effects that are just as debilitating.''

   From the beginning, it was a river of
death within an ocean teeming with life, an oil spill of
incomprehensible proportions and incalculable consequences.
   When the Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef 4 minutes into
March 24, 1989, and leaked almost 11 million gallons of Alaska
crude into the sea, the resulting destruction numbed the mind.
   Every statistic set a record.
   Searchers bagged 34,400 dead seabirds. Thousands more simply
disappeared. At least 1,000 sea otters died; 151 eagles were lost;
1,100 miles of shoreline was soaked with oil. No one yet knows the
impact on salmon fry that swam away from hatcheries through the
crude _ will they come back when it's their turn? What about the
herring? The long-term impact on whales and bears?
   The human impact equaled an invasion force. An army of animal
rescuers, beach cleaners, rock scrubbers, bureaucrats, experts,
more experts, foreign experts, even tourists, descended upon Prince
William Sound.
   In Valdez, Seward, Cordova, Homer, Kodiak and all the villages
along the soiled seacoast, grocery boys, exhausted phone workers,
carpenters, fishermen, merchants, housewives, schoolchildren,
veterinarians, police officers and educators found their lives
upside down, inside out.
   Yet amid all the statistics and clamor, behind all the
finger-pointing and 150 civil lawsuits, individual memories are
traced in the grease and grief.
   Here are the voices of four Alaskans, people whose lives were
changed by what happened that frigid, clear Good Friday in Prince
William Sound.

<HEAD>The Park Ranger</HEAD>

   Two glass jars of congealed tar sit on Anne Castellina's desk at
the Seward headquarters of Kenai Fjords National Park. They are
stinking reminders of carcasses, tears, lost sleep and disrupted
lives, all left in the deadly wake of the Exxon Valdez.
   One jar's contents were collected soon after oil blackened the
magnificent coastline Ms. Castellina, as Kenai Fjords
superintendent, is charged to protect. The other was filled last
fall, eight months after the crude came ashore. The stench from
both is gut-wrenching. The difference in the second jar lies in the
residue of dead flesh and a just-recognizable feather.
   Ms. Castellina remembers:
   ``I didn't have any idea what was coming, I just knew we were
getting sucked into it very fast. Our staff meeting on March 30th
was the last sane time for nine months. When I saw the phone man
installing 25 lines and dragging in a huge Xerox machine, I knew we
were cookin'.''
   Kenai Fjords is Ms. Castellina's first assignment as chief of a
national park. At 39, she is a 13-year park service veteran, with
past assignments in Virginia, Florida and New York.
   ``The oil hit April 10th. It was the worst day of my life. I
couldn't believe how bad it was. It was the daily 6 p.m. briefing
of the Multi Agency Coordinating (MAC) Group. Our weatherman stood
up and said, `Today we had impacts on the headlands of Aialik
Peninsula.'
   ``I just lost it. My mind blanked. I was stunned. ... That night
I could hardly talk. I had an overwhelming feeling of guilt. That's
my park and I didn't stop the oil from hitting it. ... I had
irrational thoughts then, and I don't think those feelings will
ever go away completely.''
   A divorced mother of three adopted sisters from Costa Rica, Ms.
Castellina's personal life evaporated.
   ``I used to work 8-to-5 with an hour for lunch. Suddenly, I
never got home before 9 or 10. A baby sitter took a cab to my house
every day at 3 p.m., cooked my kids' dinner, got them bathed and in
bed. She didn't drive so I'd give her cash and she'd go to the
grocery store in a cab. My taxes didn't get done until late May. I
remember sitting there thinking, `I don't have the energy to do
this and, besides, it's not important. The IRS can wait.' I paid a
huge late penalty.''
   Ms. Castellina was head of the Seward MAC group, a crisis
committee encompassing local, state and federal agencies.
   ``I gave up worrying about my career about the time the Coast
Guard threatened to take my job. Exxon and the Coast Guard kept
saying, `You don't have a problem here,' but when Sen. Ted Stevens
(R-Alaska) showed up he said, `You guys have got a problem here,'
and we said, `Yes, we know.'
   ``That's when (MAC) got in the oil booming business. We took
unilateral action. It was a really scary time. (The Interior
Department in) Washington was screaming, but Anchorage always
backed me up; they were a tremendous buffer even though they were
taking it in the shorts.
   ``I decided the hell with it. If I get fired, I get fired. I've
got to go on instinct and what the scientific data tells me. I
couldn't second-guess my decisions. If I'd done that I'd have lost
my mind.''
   Kenai Fjords has seven permanent employees and six to 12 summer
workers to oversee 670,000 acres and 400 miles of coastline.
   ``My staff was falling apart. One person withdrew from spill
activity, just couldn't handle it. Another who was out in the field
most of the summer saw his marriage fall apart. ... Meanwhile,
77,000 visitors arrived and had to be served properly. I got a
series of bladder infections and lived on antibiotics. But my
stress-caused asthma cleared up. Funny, huh?''
   Since then, Ms. Castellina has been elected to the board of the
Chamber of Commerce. The Seward Phoenix Log newspaper recently
selected her Citizen of the Year. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan
Jr. flew in on an inspection tour and presented her with the
Interior Department Honor Award.
   ``I'm a lot less naive. I'm less able to take things at face
value because of all the broken promises. I've matured in my
understanding of the political aspects of disasters.
   ``I now hear myself saying to my younger, firebrand colleagues,
`Don't worry about it, we'll get it worked out.' I am trying to be
consistent and keep my integrity, because more of the same is
coming at us again this summer as we try once again to clean this
mess up.''

   ``Before the spill, I had it made,'' said John Devens. ``I was a
reasonably popular mayor who'd served longer than anybody ever
elected. I was a college president with a good income and real good
status. I had a charter boat operator's license and ran a little
audiology practice on the side. I had as near a perfect life as you
could have.''
   Remembering times before March 24, 1989, Devens allows a trace
of wistfulness into his voice, as though he's describing an old
friend who's moved away.
   He was mayor of Valdez from 1984 until last October, when he
decided not to run again. He presided over a town of 3,500, a place
nicknamed ``The Switzerland of Alaska'' because of mountains and
glaciers that tumble into the sea. Home of the tanker terminal for
the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, Valdez was America's richest city
per capita when oil prices were at their peak.

   Before the Exxon Valdez ran aground 30 miles southwest of his
front door, Devens was content. One year later, everything is
different.
   ``Now I'm running for Congress; without the spill I would never
have done this,'' he said. ``I had a personality change. Before, I
took a strong development stand. When the spill occurred I wasn't
as environmentally conscious as I was concerned about the town. I
was very parochial.''
   Devens, 49, is on eight months' leave as president of Prince
William Sound Community College, running for Alaska's single U.S.
House seat. If he gains the Democratic nomination, as yet
uncontested, he'll face nine-term incumbent Republican Don Young.
   ``I was never officially notified of the spill. I started
working 17 hours a day, seven days a week. I made unilateral
decisions, which upset the council and angered people. When I said
I did not welcome the Exxon Valdez back into the port of Valdez
once they got it off the reef, somebody put up a sign down at the
Exxon office that said, `Benedict Arnold Devens.'
   ``I lost a lot of friends, but I made good decisions and I'm
proud of them. Before the spill ... the dog leash ordinance was
what got people riled up most in Valdez. Suddenly Exxon was running
wild _ we didn't know who was who, all we knew was that there were
guys in hard hats running around making decisions about our town. .
..
   ``These guys thought they could do anything they wanted to.
There was an arrogance in the way they went about protecting their
company that was opposed to our duty to protect our city and our
environment. I had to make dozens of decisions a day. I became very
unpopular with my Alyeska (Pipeline Service Co.) friends.''
   Devens says he knows ``something about tilting at windmills.''
With a doctorate in speech pathology, he started Alaska's only
accredited community college in 1979 with a budget of $118,000 and
no teachers. Today the school has a $3 million budget, 1,000 mostly
part-time students and 35 employees.
   For his campaign, he admits he has little statewide recognition
and hasn't yet raised much money.
   ``I could have chartered my boat to Exxon during the cleanup for
as much as $250,000 and used that money to run my campaign, but I
never took a penny for anything _ my car, my spare room, my boat.
As it all unfolded I became more and more concerned about what was
happening to the people. I started screaming for reform, help for
the native communities, relief for the fishermen.
   ``Exxon keeps saying it wasn't much of a disaster, we only found
36,000 dead birds. They missed the whole point. There's a whole lot
of suffering going on in Prince William Sound, not just the
animals, but the people, too.
   ``I've learned you don't appreciate how much you care for
something until it is threatened. Attitudes in Alaska have changed.
This state is looking at itself for the long haul instead of just
the short term. We no longer trust the oil industry to take care of
us because it won't. We have to take care of ourselves.''

   In late March the Arctic sun rises early over Prince William
Sound. It makes the mountains glow like pearls, warms sea otters
playing at the water's edge, reveals a bald eagle in a distant
tree, exposes a coyote on the prowl.
   As Michelle Hahn O'Leary pours $4-a-gallon milk on her
$4.79-a-box cereal, spreads $2.13-a-pound margarine on a piece of
$2.70-a-loaf bread, she gazes at the panorama and says, to no one
in particular, for the several thousandth time, ``This is why I
live here.''
   ``Here'' is Cordova, near the confluence of Whiskey and Eccles
Creeks, just before the glacier-cold streams tumble into the bay in
front of her kitchen window. There is no road to Cordova. It is
reachable only by boat or plane.
   There is also no road to the house Michelle and Mike O'Leary
built. They like it that way. Walking keeps them in shape for the
rigorous commercial fishing season that runs from early spring
through the summer. It's also great conditioning for the local ski
mountain, an all-volunteer enterprise that takes most of Mike
O'Leary's winter time. He's a third-generation Alaskan; she came
north from Oregon 16 years ago, when she was 18.
   ``I've always loved the outdoors, and I wanted hands-on work.
That's why I became a fisherman. The weather's always different,
the currents are different. Mike and I mostly fish together, we
have our own boat. We fish for salmon in Bristol Bay and have
herring permits in Prince William Sound.''
   Last year, just as the O'Learys were ready to plant their
kelp-baited impoundment boxes and collect the herring roe laid in
the kelp by passing fish, a delicacy that fetches up to $25 a pound
in Japan, the Exxon Valdez ran aground.
   ``My husband and I were the first fishermen in Cordova to find
out about the spill when a friend called from Seattle at 6:30 a.m.
He'd heard it on the news. I almost threw up. I felt like
somebody'd kicked me in the gut.
   ``Mike and I looked at each other with tears in our eyes and
knew our lives would never be the same, the sound would never be
the same.''
   Three days after the spill, Michelle O'Leary was appointed to
the board of the Cordova District Fishermen United, the oldest
fishing organization in Alaska. CDFU has always opposed the tanker
terminal in nearby Valdez. At environmental impact hearings in the
early 1970s prior to construction of the trans-Alaska pipeline, the
oil industry brushed aside CDFU fears about potential oil spills in
Prince William Sound.
   ``Knowing it could happen didn't help prepare us for the
physical, mental, emotional stress and strain to come. By noon we
had 50 fishing boats ready to fight the spill, but Exxon never
returned our phone calls.
   ``I think Exxon was in a state of denial for the first six
weeks. I think they felt it happened in an area where people
weren't sophisticated enough to communicate the crisis to the rest
of the world, that we'd all sit home and let it go by.
   ``They'd say to me, `It's 60 miles away from Cordova, what are
you worried about?' Exxon didn't understand that 60 miles in Alaska
is nothing, it's our front yard.''
   Michelle O'Leary became a fixture at spill-related meetings in
Valdez, Anchorage and Washington. Her poignant testimony was
captured on national TV and radio. There was no herring season, no
spring skiing. The O'Learys finally got to Bristol Bay in July for
the salmon run, so when they added that profit to their Exxon
claims, they earned about the same in 1989 that they had the year
before.
   But ``the bottom line isn't just money any more. The old ways of
rape and pillage are no longer acceptable, but Exxon hasn't figured
that out. I think they thought if they threw enough money up in the
air people would say, `Oh, yeah, that's enough, that will take care
of it,' but that's not what happened.''

   Exxon says it has spent $2 billion on the spill; the company is
under federal order to return to the cleanup May 1.
   ``This spill has raised the environmental consciousness of the
whole world. I believe the 1990s will be spent trying to achieve a
balance between good ecology and sound economics.
   ``I love oil. I love to have a fishing boat that burns oil,
instead of having to row it to catch salmon. But there has to be a
balance. Every person has to do their part. Corporations and
Congress have to take responsibility and change their ways.
   ``I will never be as uninvolved in the political process as I
was before the spill. I know now that I am not afraid to be
emotional and to speak from the heart. And I have learned that one
person, one voice, can make a difference.''

<HEAD>The Oil Man</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Lyle Von Bargen, 61, has worked in the oil industry most of his
adult life. For 17 years he's been community relations manager for
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the umbrella company created by eight
petroleum giants who built the $8 billion trans-Alaska pipeline.
Exxon owns about 20 percent of Alyeska.
   In the decade since Von Bargen moved his family from Alyeska
headquarters in Anchorage to Valdez, they have built a place in the
community. His two teen-age daughters are star students; Lisa, the
elder, will probably be valedictorian of her graduating class. In
the year since the Exxon Valdez tainted the entire oil industry,
life has not been easy.
   ``The first month I left the house at 6 a.m. If I got home
before midnight I was lucky. The days all ran together. I just
tried to assist, to keep updating information. I was working with
Exxon; I'd keep asking them what was going on. I took a lot of
people on tours, got in a lot of helicopter time. ... We usually
had an Alyeska vice president or the president here, but I usually
gave the tour. ... It was my territory.''
   Von Bargen came to Alaska from Minnesota in 1952 and took a job
driving for Anchorage City Transit. Then he hired on with a company
that delivered fuel up and down the Kenai Peninsula. He transferred
out of a truck cab into an office job and by 1968 was Alaskan sales
manager for Union Oil Co.
   ``I'm the kind of guy who ... can get dirt on my hands, I know I
can still do that if I have to. A lot of people have never done
that. If I were uncomfortable in my job, or didn't like it, I could
leave it.''
   He still drives 30,000 miles a year around interior Alaska,
often in blizzards. He says it's safer than flying. Once his path
was blocked by a snowslide 100 feet wide and 6 feet high. Just
before he turned around, another avalanche buried the road behind
him. In the dark, he and a few other motorists shoveled their way
to safety. It was, he said, the Alaska way.
   ``The mayor (ex-Valdez Mayor John Devens) was really hammering
on Exxon, and we (Alyeska) took that as hammering on us, too. The
mayor got on the bandwagon that we had let them all down, but
that's not true. Most everybody here _ the technicians, the workers
_ felt we did our job. We followed the oil spill contingency plan.
   ``Every day, every day, everybody was hammering Exxon for not
picking up the oil 5 minutes after it got on the water. It got
demoralizing to some people ... it just plain got demoralizing.''
   But Von Bargen says attacks on the oil industry never depressed
him or his family.
   ``I've had an awful lot of people walk up to me and say they
were sorry about what was in the news, because they live here in
Valdez and they know better. They know it wasn't like that.''
   As Alyeska's front-line representative to communities along the
798-mile-long pipeline, Von Bargen attends many civic and social
events.
   ``Every place I go I'm asked questions, and 99.9 percent of the
people ... understand what happened and say, `Yes, it was an
accident, it's something we have to live with and we don't ever
want to happen again, but we have to move forward, put it behind us
and get on with our lives.'''
   These days Von Bargen spends a lot of time escorting reporters
and government types through the tanker terminal, explaining
Alyeska's new spill response team, SERVS _ Ships Escort Response
Vessels System. The consortium has two new tanker escort ships and
100 people trained to respond immediately to spills.
   ``I think memories of the spill will go away, but it will take a
while. For a long time March 27th was always remembered as the day
of the 1964 Good Friday earthquake. That's the way March 24th will
be _ the day of the Good Friday oil spill. ...
   ``What I've learned from all this is that accidents do happen,
that after 13 years of smooth operations the Exxon Valdez spill did
happen, that this is part of progress. We have learned from this
spill, learned that it is easier to prevent it than clean it up.''

<HEAD>Dollar Rally Perks Up Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strong dollar in foreign exchange has lately
proved to be an effective antidote for many of the ailments
afflicting Wall Street.
   Analysts generally agree it is no coincidence that the stock
market has rallied since mid-winter at the same time that the
dollar steadied after falling in value through the closing months
of 1989.
   The U.S. currency's showing has been particularly noteworthy by
comparison to that symbol of competitive might, the Japanese yen.
The dollar's value in yen has increased by more than 5 percent
since the start of 1989 and roughly 15 percent over the past year.
   That, brokers say, helped insulate stock prices in the United
States from the jolt of a sharp selloff on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   In addition, it appears to have eased fears that rising interest
rates in Europe and the Far East would lure foreign capital out of
the American markets, where it is presumably needed to help finance
the federal government's budget deficit.
   ``Japanese investors have done far better this year by investing
in our bonds than in their own,'' says Gray Cardiff, editor of the
investment letter Sound Advice in Danville, Calif. ``A principal
reason for this is that the dollar has been rising in value against
the yen.
   ``The profits from the currency gain have more than offset price
losses experienced in our dollar-denominated Treasury bonds.
   ``Accordingly, the idea that the Japanese could lose their
fondness for our Treasuries is not supported by the experience so
far this year. As long as the dollar is strong against the yen, the
Japanese are likely to do better over here.''
   Whenever the ups and downs of the dollar exert a significant
influence on stock prices, the effects can seem unpredictable and
inconsistent.
   After all, American stocks rose sharply in 1985 and 1986 with a
big boost from expectations that a falling dollar would help
improve the U.S. trade deficit, by making imports more expensive in
this country and exports cheaper abroad.
   Why would stock traders now welcome a rising dollar? The answer
may be partly psychological, analysts say.
   The dollar's recent gains are seen as a testimony to the
stability and favorable long-term prospects of the U.S. economy, at
a time when the world political and economic landscape is changing
fast.
   On a more pragmatic level, strength in the dollar suggests that
global investors are less fearful of inflation in the United States
than in nations with faster economic growth of late, most notably
West Germany and Japan.
   As analysts at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. put it in the firm's
weekly publication The Outlook: ``The rising greenback has been
boosting stocks via its counterinflationary implications and by
signifying confidence in the U.S. economy.''
   The result of that in the past week was a 57.89-point rise in
the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials to 2,741.22, it highest
level since early January.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.74 to
187.92; the American Stock Exchange market value index was up 3.03
at 364.18, and the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market gained 5.40 to 442.16.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 154.44 million shares a day,
against 157.73 million the week before.
   Some analysts think the dollar's recent rise has carried it to
``overvalued'' levels. They doubt it can sustain an advance without
improvement in such fundamental concerns as the trade and budget
deficits.
   But for the moment at least, currency traders seem willing to
gamble that relief might be on the way for even those chronic
worries.

<HEAD>Market Reform Adventure Skirts More Boobytraps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like an Indiana Jones adventure, the quest for
stock market reform on Capitol Hill plunged into new perils just
when things seemed safe.
   After three months of negotiations, a House panel this past week
approved a five-point market reform legislative package that would
give the Securities and Exchange Commission limited authority
during market emergencies to halt a high-volume form of
computerized trading, commonly known as program trading.
   But a similar Senate bill has no program trading provision and
the Treasury Department warned the House provision was unnecessary
and could jeopardize the passage of other reforms.
   At the same time, the long-simmering turf battle between the SEC
and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission bubbled over when a
pair of congressmen said they were exploring legislation to merge
both agencies.
   A nationwide trade group, the Securities Industry Association,
added to the confusion by calling for Congress to designate the SEC
as sole regulator of both stocks and stock index futures. Futures
currently come under CFTC regulation.
   It was one of the more confusing weeks in the congressional
effort to rein in the deregulated securities markets, which began
after the 1987 stock market crash. The outlook for meaningful
reform now looks murkier than before.
   Legislation to prevent future financial disasters had been
inching along until the market plunged 190 points last October _
speeding up the Senate bill. When junk bond giant Drexel Burnham
Lambert foundered and sank last month, that broke a logjam in the
House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   The Senate bill would allow the SEC to halt trading _ with the
president's approval _ in market emergencies; tighten financial
disclosure requirements by securities firms; require detailed
reports on large trades and develop nationwide procedures for
clearing and settling transactions. That bill has no program
trading restrictions.
   Program trading is the rapid, computer-driven sale or purchase
of huge blocks of securities, not necessarily related to their
underlying value.
   The most controversial version is called index arbitrage, in
which traders try to exploit price discrepencies between stocks and
stock index futures. It has been blamed by some studies as a cause
of the sharp rises and drops in stock prices that have spooked many
individual investors out of the market.
   The House amendment, the result of three months of negotiations
among the SEC, the securities industry and House staffers,
satisfied panel members who objected to the original anti-program
trading language as vague and ambiguous.
   The new version would limit the SEC's authority to restrict
activities _ including program trading _ that previously have been
determined to contribute to extraordinary volatility.
   ``I don't think it's any surprise the bill passed,'' said
Washington attorney Russell B. Stevenson Jr., a former SEC
assistant general counsel. He said the bill still gives the SEC
broad powers that may be excessive.
   ``Just because the industry went along with it doesn't mean
Congress has succeeded in resolving the problem in an intelligent
way,'' he said.
   Stevenson said, however, that he thought ``the pendulum is
swinging in the direction of a greater role for the SEC in the
regulation of financial futures.''
   Others familiar with the securities re-regulation effort are
disturbed by some of the reform proposals. Chicago attorney Alton
Harris, for example, a former counsel to the Senate Banking
Committee's securities subcommittee, called the idea of merging the
SEC and the CFTC naive and irresponsible.
   ``There are profound differences between the way these two
markets operate,'' said Harris. ``I'm somewhat worried that we're
building up a political head of steam for a quick fix.''
   The issue will get an airing later this month. The Senate
Banking Committee tentatively has scheduled a hearing on the
jurisdictional dispute.
   In other business and economic developments this past week:
   _Investment strategists looking for evidence of the economy's
direction found little in the latest government statistics. The
Labor Department's wholesale price index for February was
unchanged. The Federal Reserve said industrial production rose
marginally. The Commerce Department said retail sales fell sharply,
largely reflecting a drop in auto sales.
   _The anemic junk bond market was whacked with more bad news.
Financially ailing Columbia Savings and Loan said it would try to
peddle its $4 billion portfolio of the risky securities in what
amounted to one big garage sale that threatened to glut the market
with more unwanted supply. Drexel Burnham Lambert, the bankrupt
junk pioneer, said it would stop quoting prices, making it more
difficult for holders to determine their value. The one dose of
good news was the government's announcement that it would become a
long-term investor of junk bonds acquired in the takeover of
insolvent thrifts.
   _The newly elected president of the Third World's biggest debtor
took immediate steps to curb a $31 billion budget deficit and a
2,700 percent annual inflation rate. The austerity measures
announced by Brazil President Fernando Collor de Mello included a
price freeze and a new currency.

<HEAD>A Watered Down Dose of Good News for Ailing Junk Bond Market</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the wobbly junk bond market, it was a good
news, bad news situation. But the bad outweighed the good, making
the market look junkier than ever.
   The new federal agency that manages insolvent savings and loans
announced this past week it would become a long-term player in the
market for high-yield, high-risk securities.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. will set up its own trading desk for
the billions of dollars in securities it holds and acquires in the
future. Although the government refuses to disclose how much it has
acquired in seizing stumbling, junk-laden S&amp;Ls, securities industry
analysts have estimated the RTC now holds $4 billion to $6 billion
worth.
   The government portfolio, expected to swell as more shaky
thrifts go under and jettison their junk, will be handled the way
other Wall Street firms handle their holdings.
   Touchy traders worried they'd be swamped by a flood of bonds
dumped by the government at fire sale prices breathed a sigh of
relief.
   The relief didn't last.
   On the same day the government outlined its plans, crippled
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association, a big thrift based in Beverly
Hills, Calif., said it wants to unload its entire junk bond
portfolio at once. S&amp;Ls are required under the thrift-bailout law
to get rid of their junk within five years.
   ``The Columbia Savings and Loan announcement throws a little bit
of fear into traders' hearts,'' said Anthony Naylor, a senior vice
president for fixed-income securities at Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc.
   However, he said the alternative water-torture approach of
selling off the junk in dribs and drabs might be worse, prolonging
the market's agony.
   Columbia estimated the value of the securities to be sold at
$3.5 billion. It would be the largest sale of a junk bond portfolio
by a thrift and one of the largest by any investor. Several
prospective buyers were said to have examined the issues.
   In announcing the plan, Edward G. Harshfield, Columbia's new
president, predicted: ``We're going to write some history with it.''
   History is in the making for junk bonds. The chapter being
written now may be about the inevitable extinction of the junk bond
market as it came to be known in the go-go 1980s of Drexel Burnham
Lambert's heyday. The government's involvement in the market might
only postpone the inevitable.
   Wall Street has always had and probably always will have
low-grade corporate debt to trade but nothing like it was during
the extended takeover binge in the last decade. The business of
issuing new high-yield bonds has virtually disappeared.
De-leveraging, or pruning debt amassed by companies in takeovers,
mergers or restructurings, has become a Wall Street buzzword.
   The nearly defunct Drexel last Thursday discontinued quoting
prices on thousands of junk bond issues in a largely symbolic
gesture continuing a withdrawal from a market it once dominated.
   Critics of junk bonds and the clout Drexel wielded say ``good
riddance.''
   As one bond market analyst at a New York investment firm put it:
``From my point of view, it's been a conspiracy for years.''
