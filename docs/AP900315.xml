   San Francisco and Charleston, S.C., radio and
television stations won Peabody Awards on Thursday for their
coverage of two natural disasters _ last October's Bay area
earthquake and Hurricane Hugo.
   CBS Radio News and Cable News Network also were honored for
their reporting of the student uprising in China.
   The annual awards for distinguished broadcasting were announced
by the University of Georgia College of Journalism and Mass
Communication. The 27 recipients will be presented the awards,
known as ``the Pulitzer Prize of broadcast journalism,'' on April 3
in Atlanta.
   KCBS-AM and KGO-TV in San Francisco were named winners for their
reporting of the earthquake, which occurred just before the
scheduled start of Game 3 of the World Series.
   ``We think it's exciting to receive an award such as this, which
is really so prestigious,'' said KCBS-AM General Manager Frank
Oxarart.
   ``I think we all knew that this was a once-in-a-lifetime story
and we all felt that we had provided a tremendous service to the
Bay area,'' said Arleen Bolton, assistant director of news and
programming at the station.
   ``We managed to stay on the air when the earthquake hit. We were
able to stay on the air and give the Bay area news and information
immediately after the quake,'' she said. ``And, of course,
everybody on the staff worked to the max and continued for days and
days _ around the clock, full commitment to the story.''
   ``We are absolutely thrilled with it,'' said KGO-TV General
Manager Jim Topping of the award. ``The staff worked
extraordinarily hard, and it was a time of great dedication. And,
clearly, the success the station had is a huge reflection of the
community's reaction.''
   The Peabody judges called the KCBS coverage ``comprehensive,
intelligent and useful,'' while KGO's reports were lauded for
``functioning as an information clearinghouse'' for viewers.
   WCSC-TV in Charleston covered Hurricane Hugo in a way that
provided a ``lifeline for viewers deprived of water, communications
and other essential services,'' the judges said.
   ``We're very honored. The award really goes to the people of the
Low Country of South Carolina who withstood all this with us,''
said Don Feldman, vice president of news at WCSC-TV.
   ``We were homeless like other people in the area. We went
through what they went through,'' he said. ``We felt like we were
victims of the storm like everybody. So, we were in there with
them.''
   Other winners included broadcasting pioneer J. Leonard Reinsch
of Atlanta, a former president of Cox Broadcasting, and veteran ABC
newsman David Brinkley, both for distinguished careers in
broadcasting.
   Awards for television drama went to CBS for its movie ``Lonesome
Dove,'' to ABC for its series ``The Wonder Years,'' ``China Beach''
and ``Small Sacrifices,'' and to the Children's Television Workshop
for ``Sesame Street.''
   MTV won a Peabody for ``Decade,'' a look at the 1980s from the
perspective of pop musicians and news makers.
   The winners were selected from 812 entries submitted by radio
and television stations and networks around the world. A 15-member
national advisory board judged the entries.
   The 50-year-old awards are named for George Foster Peabody, a
Columbus, Ga., native who became a banker and philanthropist in New
York.

   Mozambique's President Joaquim Chissano said
Thursday his government is willing to start talks within several
weeks with the RENAMO rebels on ending the country's 10-year civil
war.
   Chissano said he was awaiting an answer from the rebels through
mediators who have been trying to bring the sides together. He
praised the United States for a seven-point proposal it presented
both sides last year to help them overcome their reluctance to
negotiate.
   ``We feel we can now go into talks,'' Chissano told reporters at
a news conference summing up three days of talks with President
Bush, top officials of his administration and congressional leaders.
   ``If RENAMO gives us a quick answer, we are ready to start,'' he
added. Negotiations could begin as soon as Chissano returns from
next week's ceremonies marking the independence of neighboring
Namibia, he said.
   RENAMO had been reluctant to accept one of the points that deals
with recognition of Mozambique's government and its constitution,
Chissano said. But now, the rebels appear willing to recognize the
government and recognition of the constitution can be worked out
during the actual peace talks, he said.
   Mozambique, which in recent years has renounced its Marxist
doctrine and shifted to a market-oriented economy, is drafting a
constitution that would allow independent candidates to run in
elections, he said. Individuals from RENAMO would be eligible to
participate, Chissano said.
   The people of Mozambique will also vote this summer on a
proposal to allow more than one political party. If that happens,
RENAMO could compete in elections, he said.
   Mozambique has been devastated by the fighting with RENAMO,
founded in the 1970s by white South Africans to counter the
government's support for the guerrillas of the African National
Congress. The group has been accused by U.S. officials and human
rights monitors of savage attacks on innocent civilians.
   Chissano said he was satisfied that the South African government
of F.W. de Klerk had stopped all assistance to RENAMO. He said
South African authorities were cooperating with his government to
stop aid for the rebels from inidividuals in South Africa. The
organization also has wealthy right-wing backers in Portugal and
Brazil.
   While praising de Klerk for progress he has made toward starting
talks with his country's black majority about the future of
apartheid, Chissano also urged the United States to maintain its
economic sanctions against South Africa ``until everyone is sure
the process is irreversible.''
   Chissano said he had asked Bush for additional financial help to
rehabilitate his country and help an estimated 5.6 million refugees
and handicapped people. Mozambique receives more than $100 million
annually from the United States, making it the largest aid
recipient in sub-Saharan Africa.

   President Bush sent a letter Thursday to
Mikhail S. Gorbachev congratulating him on his unopposed election
as president of the Soviet Union.
   Bush wrote Gorbachev ``wishing him well as he leads the Soviet
Union into the next stage of perestroika and democratization,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   He added Bush is looking forward ``to their forthcoming summit
in June as an opportunity to broaden the already considerable

   Supporters of rival candidates for
local elections fought with pistols and bombs Thursday, killing one
woman and injuring 12 other people in southern Bangladesh, police
said.
   The clashes occurred on the second day of 12-day-long polls to
elect local administrative councils throughout the country. At
least one person was killed and 50 people injured in clashes when
balloting began Wednesday.
   Police in the town of Uttar Amirabad, 135 miles southeast of
Dhaka, said a 40-year-old woman was caught in the cross-fire
between rival groups and died of bullet wounds.
   The police officials, who were contacted by telephone, spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   They said at least 12 people were injured in the clashes.
   The March 14-25 polls are being fought on non-partisan lines,
but clashes erupt between supporters of rival parties because local
voters know the political affiliations of the technically
independent candidates.
   At least two people were killed in the campaigning for the
elections.

   John Poindexter erased 5,000 computer files at
the time he was resigning as national security adviser during the
Iran-Contra scandal, a computer expert testified today at
Poindexter's trial.
   Kelly Williams said Poindexter deleted the files from his
computer, leaving just 50 of his own computer files behind when he
departed the National Security Council in November 1986.
   Deleting the files would be comparable to ``taking a manila
envelope and just throwing it away?'' asked associate independent
counsel Louise Radin.
   ``Yes, that would be the effect,'' replied Williams, who was in
charge of the computer software section at the White House
communications agency in 1986.
   Under questioning from Radin, Williams noted that Poindexter was
logged onto the computer system for a 15-hour span on Nov. 24,
1986, starting at 4:30 in the morning. That was the day before the
national security adviser resigned.
   On Nov. 22, then-White House aide Oliver North deleted 732 notes
from his own computer file, leaving a total of just one.
   Copies of some of the deleted computer files of Poindexter and
Oliver North were recovered from back-up computer tapes kept at the
NSC and have been instrumental in tracing the Iran-Contra affair.
   The deletions are part of a conspiracy charge against
Poindexter. He is accused of working with North to destroy NSC
records in an attempt to conceal the Iran initiative and North's
military assistance to the Contras.
   Earlier today, Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb said North gave
such valuable testimony that the government may conclude its case
against Poindexter by Monday.
   Webb said North's testimony ``went well'' and that the
government ``got a lot'' out of the former White House aide, who
testified that he witnessed Poindexter tear up a politically
embarrassing presidential document.
   Earlier, during North's four days on the stand, U.S. District
Judge Harold Greene called North a ``hostile witness'' and said
getting him to answer questions on the stand was like ``pulling
teeth.''
   But Webb said today that North's testimony ``cut off two or
three weeks'' of the prosecution's work and that ``I could rest as
early as Monday.''
   During his testimony, North said Poindexter sent him to a
meeting with members of Congress where North lied by denying he was
assisting the Contras. Before the meeting, Poindexter assured North
that he could ``take care of'' the matter.
   After Webb's remarks, the prosecution called as a witness the
former general counsel to the CIA, Stanley Sporkin, who drafted the
presidential finding that Poindexter subsequently destroyed.
   Sporkin explained how he was contacted in late November 1985 by
the CIA's deputy director, John McMahon, and was briefed by agency
staffers on a Hawk missile shipment to Iran that the CIA was
assisting.
   ``It was my preliminary view ... that ... for the CIA to provide
help that I would require that the president of the United States''
sign a document approving the action, Sporkin testified.
   Federal law requires that ``before the CIA can undertake'' such
activity in a foreign country ``it must have a finding,'' said
Sporkin.
   The document wasn't drafted until after the Hawks were
delivered, so Sporkin included a sentence saying that ``all prior
actions taken by U.S. ... officials'' in the operation ``are hereby
ratified.''
   The document, which depicted the Iran initiative as a straight
arms-for-hostages deal, was torn up by Poindexter a year later when
the arms sales were exposed.
   Sporkin is now a U.S. district judge serving in the same
courthouse where Poindexter is on trial.
   The hurriedly drafted document, known as a ``finding,'' depicted
the U.S. government as being involved in a straight
arms-for-hostages deal with Iran. Poindexter presented it to
President Reagan for his signature two weeks after the missiles
were sent to Iran.
   Poindexter tore it up when the administration's Iran initiative
was exposed a year later. He destroyed the paper the same day he
told the House and Senate intelligence committees that he hadn't
known about the Hawk shipment until five weeks after it occurred.
   The prosecution contends that Poindexter's knowledge that the
document existed was his motive in concealing the U.S. role in the
Hawk shipment from Congress.
   The former national security adviser also is accused of two
counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of making false
statements by allegedly covering up North's military assistance to
the Contras and concealing the U.S. role in the missile shipment to
Iran.

   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee has invited Soviet Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev to testify
this spring on the rapid developments in the Soviet Union.
   ``The more we know about the remarkable changes going on in the
Soviet Union, the better we'll be at deciding how to buy the right
stuff for America's defense,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., who
also announced plans to expand contacts with the Soviet Union's
national legislature.
   The legislature _ formally known as the Defense and State
Security Committee of the Supreme Soviet _ is the rough equivalent
of the House Armed Services panel.
   Moiseyev's schedule calls for the chief of the Soviet General
Staff to visit the the United States in May.
   Marshal Sergey Akhromeyev, an adviser to Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, appeared before the panel last year.
   Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., the panel's ranking GOP member,
said that although the United States should base ``its military
posture on Soviet capabilities and not intentions, meetings like
this are always constructive in nature.''

   The Bush administration said today a Libyan
chemical weapons plant had been extensively damaged by fire and
apparently was unable to function.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater denied anew that
the United States was responsible for the blaze at the Rabta
chemical plant.
   ``We don't know the origins of the fire,'' he said. ``We don't
know if it was sabotage. We don't have any idea who did it. ...
Somebody could have knocked over a kerosene lamp or something.''
   Without revealing the source of his information, Fitzwater
characterized the damage at the plant as extensive. ``Common sense
would tell you it's not functioning,'' he said. ``We assume it's
not functioning.''
   However, he also said, ``The building is there but is it all
burned out inside? We don't really know.''
   President Bush was asked at a pre-St. Patrick's Day party thrown
by House Speaker Thomas Foley what information he had on the
chemical plant blaze.
   ``Not much,'' Bush said.
   Asked by a reporter if the United States had been involved in
the fire, Bush said, ``No, but we've already said that.''
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi threatened today to retaliate
against West Germany if its agents set fire to the plant. West
Germany denied responsibility.
   Gadhafi said the heavily guarded plant was designed only to
produce pharmaceuticals, but said Libya would be willing to pay
millions of dollars to any company that builds it a chemical
weapons facility.
   President Bush said Wednesday the United States had heard rumors
that the plant was on fire but that he did not know what had
happened.
   Fitzwater said the United States was told of the fire by
diplomatic sources, who also said Libya had sealed its borders.
   ``We just dare not speculate on the cause,'' Fitzwater said.
   Mahmoud Azzabi, press secretary at Libya's United Nations
mission in New York, confirmed Wednesday night ``there is a fire''
at the Rabta plant 60 miles southwest of Tripoli.
   ``There is speculation that it was possibly sabotage, somebody
coming in from Tunisia,'' which borders on Libya, he said.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. quoted an unidentified spokesman
for the official Libyan news agency Jana as saying there had been a
fire in some machinery at the plant but that the building had not
been damaged.
   ABC News quoted unidentified Libyan security sources as claiming
that the plant was burned to the ground by the action of U.S. and
Israeli agents.
   ``We have no information to indicate that,'' Roman Popadiuk, a
White House deputy press secretary, said of the ABC report.
   Fitzwater said last week the White House was seriously concerned
by evidence that the plant was producing chemical weapons after a
year of little activity.
   He said then that the plant ``is dangerous and becoming more
so'' and called for ``vigorous efforts to stop the operation'' of
the plant. He refused to rule out military action to close it.
   Despite Libyan denials, U.S. officials have said the plant has
been producing limited quantities of mustard and nerve gases.
   In the past, Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi has said the
plant was designed to produce pharmaceuticals.
   The United States engaged in hostilities with Libya three times
in the 1980s, twice shooting down Libyan fighter planes and bombing
Tripoli in 1986 in retaliation for what then-President Reagan said
was terrorism against Americans in Europe.
   Western journalists were invited to tour the plant in January
1989, but they were not allowed to inspect it after they arrived in
Rabta.
   The Libyans built a small village of cement block apartment
buildings, schools and community buildings about a mile beyond the
gates to the complex to house the workers.
   The journalists did see that the area was protected with
surface-to-air missile batteries, tanks and soldiers. A short
distance away, a radar station operated on a high, barren ridge
overlooking the highway that led to the industrial complex.
   The West German government has investigated allegations that a
West German company helped build the plant.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of handicapped preschoolers aren't
getting the help the Bureau of Indian Affairs is required to
provide, government investigators say.
   Only 838 of the estimated 3,000 handicapped 3-year-olds and
4-year-olds on reservations with BIA schools were getting special
education in the 1988-89 school year, the General Accounting Office
said in a report released this month.
   At least a fourth of the children who are receiving some
services weren't getting all the help they need because of
shortages of qualified teachers and the money to hire them, the GAO
said.
   ``There are a tremendous number of Indian families who don't
even know that the reason why their child is so slow is that they
have a developmental disability,'' said Yvette Joseph, an aide to
the Senate Indian Affairs Committee.
   The Interior Department contended in its response to the report
that the department, which includes the BIA, had ``successfully
implemented child-find activities for many years.''
   Congress will consider legislation to require greater
cooperation between states and federal agencies on special
education programs for Indian children, she said Thursday.
   Congress in 1986 required the government to make sure all
handicapped Indian children aged 3 to 5 on reservations with BIA
schools get a ``free and appropriate'' education.
   The GAO cited an acute shortage of qualified teachers in many
areas.
   For example, only eight of the 28 Head Start teachers for
children on the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota even had
teaching credentials and none of them had training in special
education.
   The other 20 teachers had only a high school diploma.
   Although the staff isn't qualified to teach handicapped
children, ``there are no alternatives,'' according to the BIA
coordinator.
   When the reservation tried to hire a speech therapist and
special education teacher, the BIA contacted 27 colleges,
universities and individuals without finding a single qualified
applicant, the study said.

   Tornadoes in the nation's midsection tossed tractor-trailers
around like toys and a record-breaking heat wave wilted plans for
the annual cherry blossom festival in Washington. Heavy rain
threatened flooding in the Midwest.
   On the heels of that heat wave, a snowstorm today closed schools
in Minnesota and surprised western Iowa. Wyoming police closed
sections of Interstates 80 and 25 because of blowing snow, and
North Dakota expected blizzard conditions.
   In Florida, a bishop asked God for rain to relieve the region's
19-month drought. And in Indiana today, a tornado preparedness
drill was called off to avoid confusion with the real storm front
predicted to be heading into the state.
   More severe thunderstorms like those that have brought twisters
to the Plains this week spread over Mississippi today in advance of
a slowly moving cold front and spawned yet another tornado.
   The tornado cut a path of destruction across rural George County
in the southeastern part of the state. Five people, including three
children, were injured when it smashed their mobile home.
   ``It knocked my trailer over, picked it up and dropped it back
again,'' said Rai Smith, 21, in a telephone interview from her
hospital room in Lucedale. ``When it all stopped, the walls became
the floor and the bathroom door was directly above me.''
   Near Columbia, Mo., a tornado damaged five businesses Wednesday
night, blowing tractor-trailers ``like matchsticks,'' said Richard
Head. He said his auto dealership was damaged by an 18-wheeler
dropped onto the roof.
   At least four tractor-trailers were blown about 100 feet across
a road, said Mike Poe, spokesman for the Boone County, Mo., Fire
Protection District.
   A tornado or high wind also damaged several mobile homes in the
area. No injuries were reported. High water kept many roads closed
this morning, but a cleanup was under way, officials said.
   ``I think we were very fortunate,'' Mike Sanford, the county's
director of emergency preparedness said today after an aerial tour.
``These were, comparatively speaking, minor events.''
   ``I was scared. Really scared,'' said Santiago Munoz, whose
trailer was damaged. ``My wife, she said, `God, God, God, God, God
take care of us.'''
   In Fordyce, Ark., about 40 miles southwest of Pine Bluff, five
people were injured by a tornado Wednesday. Bill Setterman, chief
sheriff's deputy, said three homes were destroyed and roofs and
porches were ripped off other homes.
   He said rescuers found one of the injured ``wrapped up like a
pretzel'' in his home.
   Two twisters in central Texas flipped mobile homes, tore off
roofs and toppled utility poles Wednesday.
   In Nebraska and Kansas, volunteers spent Wednesday and today
clearing up debris from dozens of tornadoes that ripped through on
Tuesday. In one town alone, Hesston, Kan., twisters killed two
people and injured 23.
   The 50 National Guard troops sent to help in Hesston were
expected to pull out today. About 1,000 people, including
volunteers from the Mennonite Disaster Service, helped the town
clean up.
   ``We feel as Christians this is one way of sharing God's love
with people who are hurting,'' said Marvin Toews, a farmer who
coordinated activities.
   East of the Mississippi Valley, at least 31 cities reported
record or record-tying high temperatures Wednesday, the third day
of unseasonable warmth.
   The records included 85 at Baltimore, 75 at Detroit, 76 at
Indianapolis and 86 at Washington's National Airport. The high at
Indianapolis erased a record on the books since 1875. Buffalo,
N.Y., registered 78 degrees.
   But the warm spell was definitely over on the northern Plains,
where up to 10 inches of snow was forecast today in eastern North
Dakota, with northerly wind blowing at 25 to 45 mph expected to
create near blizzard conditions.
   Heavy, wet snow mixed with sleet and freezing rain socked
southwestern Minnesota today, forcing the closing of at least 28
schools. Up to 10 inches of snow was possible. And up to 9 inches
had already fallen by midday in western Iowa, where meteorologists
said the storm caught them offr-guard.
   Farther west, the Wyoming Highway Patrol closed sections of I-80
and I-25 and some other highways because snow blown by 25 mph wind
cut visibility nearly to zero.
   Cherry blossoms in the nation's capital will peak today and
Friday because of the unseasonable warmth and will be gone by the
April opening of the annual Cherry Blossom Festival, said National
Park Service spokeswoman Marja Morris.
   ``They'll only last four or five days,'' she said.
   Tulips, though, are about three weeks ahead of schedule and will
flower in time for the cherry blossom festival, she said.
   A cold front was expected to end the record-breaking warm
weather tonight.
   Fruit farmers in New Jersey fear the heat may have fooled their
blueberries, peaches and nectarines into budding before freezing
temperatures end.
   ``The weather is making the peaches say, `Ooh, isn't it nice,''
said Genie DeCou, who runs a 500-acre peach, nectarine and apple
farm in Shiloh.
   Thunderstorms in the Midwest dumped heavy rain, which was
compounded in Wisconsin by a dam burst on a pond leading to the
Trempealeau River. But Arcadia, Wis., Police Chief Patrick
Grzadzielewski said the river was receding.
   ``Everything we've been doing up to this point has been
preparing for the worst and, hopefully, that will not happen now,''
he said.
   In Vernon County in west-central Missouri, 8-year-old Travis
Koehn of Walker was found dead Wednesday after falling into a
swollen stream.
   In St. Petersburg, Fla., Roman Catholic Bishop John Favalora is
praying for rain. ``I am confident that the Lord will hear our
prayers,'' he said in a message broadcast every hour on the local
Catholic radio station.
   The Indiana tornado drills had been scheduled for early
afternoon and evening today. Warning sirens were to sound and
schools and other public facilities were to conduct drills. But the
same front that spawned the torndoes in the Plains was heading
eastward, officials said.
   Steve Haines, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service
in Indianapolis, said the drill was postponed until Friday to
alleviate any confusion. ``They'll think it's the real thing,''
Haines said. ``We don't want to confuse the two.''

<HEAD>State Department Says Sudan Relief Depends on Warring Factions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush administration officials said Thursday
they hope food aid can soon resume flowing to Sudan, but they
strongly criticized the government of the famine-wracked African
nation.
   ``To put it bluntly, the relief situation has deteriorated,''
Assistant Secretary of State Herman J. Cohen told a joint hearing
of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa and a task
force on hunger.
   Cohen, who visited the African nation last week, said a civil
war between the government and separatists in the south has blocked
international relief agencies from shipping food into the country.
   ``Both sides in the current conflict ... say they want peace,
but both continue to fight,'' he said.
   Three million Sudanese are homeless and 500,000 are at risk of
death as a result of war and famine. Some 250,000, many of them
children, died last year.
   The United States joined other nations last year in Operation
Lifeline Sudan. Washington contributed more than 60 percent of the
food delivered, at a cost of $72 million.
   The project succeeded in part because of a cease-fire between
government troops and the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Army. But the
SPLA broke the cease-fire last October and the fighting continued.
   ``A number of actions by the government have so far severely
hampered a resumption of last year's successful operation,'' Cohen
said. ``The SPLA must share the blame for this deterioration.''
   Foreign donors are attempting to negotiate with the Sudanese
government to begin another round of Operation Lifeline Sudan.
   ``While we cannot say that the relief effort is definitely back
on track, we hope that it will be shortly,'' Cohen said. ``I am
confident that the Sudanese government will fulfill its pledge to
cooperate on Operation Lifeline Sudan.''
   Andrew Natsios, director of the Agency for International
Development's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, said the
Sudanese government believes weapons were smuggled to rebels in the
south in the food shipments. Natsios said Washington has assurred
the gvoernment this is not the case.
   Cohen, meantime, said the U.S. government has told the Sudanese
government, which was installed in a coup last June, that its
``human rights record needs improvement.''
   There have been reports, he said, that prisoners have been
mistreated and held for long periods of time.
   Washington has also pressed the Sudanese to return the country
to representative government. Although the United States gives
Sudan food aid, it has cut off all military and economic aid since
last year's coup.

<TEXT>
   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres won a
parliamentary showdown with the rival Likud bloc today when
lawmakers voted no-confidence in Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
hard-line government.
   The 60-55 vote gave Peres a chance to form a Labor-led coalition.
   Shamir, the first premier to be turned out of office by a
parliamentary vote in the history of the Jewish state, will remain
as caretaker prime minister until a new government is seated.
   Peres won after Shamir rejected a compromise offered by the
ultra-Orthodox Shas Party's spiritual leader Ovadia Yosef, who
called for acceptance of U.S. peace proposals for a
Palestinian-Israeli dialogue. Five of the six lawmakers from Shas
then failed to attend the vote, giving Peres the margin of victory.
   The compromise proposal was offered earlier today after more
than five hours of angry debate in the 120-seat parliament. The
debate was suspended to give the major political parties time to
consider the compromise.
   The U.S. proposals would allow a deported Palestinian and a
resident of Arab east Jerusalem to serve on a Palestinian
negotating team that would meet with Israelis in Cairo.
   Shamir told parliament earlier today that the acceptance of
Arabs from east Jerusalem in the peace process would compromise
Israel's claim to sovereignty over the sector captured from Jordan
in 1967.
   Under the proposed compromise, the two parties would have agreed
that Jerusalem is not negotiable and that it would remain united
under Israel's rule. Shamir also would have reinstated Labor
ministers to the coalition in exchange for which the centr-left
Labor would drop its no-confidence motion.
   Before the no-confidence vote, leaders of Labor and Likud both
visited Yosef to discuss the proposed compromise, but to no avail.
   When Peres called for the no-confidence vote against Shamir
today, he accused the right-wing leader of ``murdering the peace
process.''
   Shamir countered with an accusation that Labor made repeated
concessions to Israel's Arab enemies, calling this a ``shameful
act.''
   The charge brought shouts of protest from Labor ministers
including Peres, who angrily wagged his finger at Shamir and
accused him of losing opportunities for peace.
   ``I propose voting no confidence in the man who ended two
processes, peace and national unity,'' Peres said in a bitter
speech.
   Shamir said he had been the driving force behind creation of the
national unity government and that his party was just as interested
in making peace as Labor. ``We are not afraid of peace or the peace
process. We fear irresponsible concessions,'' Shamir said, calling
for a defeat of the no-confidence motion.
   Shamir said the United States complicated the peace process by
raising the sensitive issue of Jerusalem and suggesting Israel's
claim to the captured Arab sector of the city should be a subject
of negotiations.
   ``There is only one Jerusalem, Israel's,'' he said.
   Peres, during his speech, pointed a finger at Shamir and accused
him of breaking his commitment to religious and secular parties:
``Who will believe you again in this country? You have broken every
promise.''
   Peres was interrupted frequently by Likud heckling, particularly
from Likud Knesset member Yehoshua Matza who kept chanting,
``Subversive! Subversive!''
   A Labor-Likud coalition, which has ruled Israel through eight
stormy years of repeated crises, collapsed Tuesday when Shamir
fired Peres and the other 10 Labor ministers resigned.
   Peres promised that a government led by his Labor Party would
start peace talks with Palestinians.
   Shamir said a victory by his Likud bloc would delay if not
cancel the Israeli-Palestinian dialogue proposed by Secretary of
State James A Baker III.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian soldiers guard gateways of two
Shiite Moslem slum districts in south Beirut in case kidnappers try
to smuggle out Terry Anderson or other Western hostages, police say.
   ``I am sure they are all alive,'' Sheik Mohammed Mehdi
Shamseddin, spiritual head of Lebanon's Shiite community, said
recently. ``That much I can safely ascertain.''
   Other senior Shiite sources said the captives were alive and
most were in south Beirut.
   Police said the Syrians tightened their security net around the
Hajjaj and Hay Madi districts after gun battles this week between
rival Shiite militias for control of the densely populated southern
slums.
   Shiite sources said none of the hostages was hurt in the
fighting between militiamen of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
believed to be an umbrella group for the hostage-holders, and the
pro-Syrian Amal movement.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Syrians moved rapidly to keep the battles from spreading through
Hajjaj and Hay Madi.
   Police said the Syrians _ armed with rocket-propelled grenades
and submachine guns _ threatened to kill any militiamen spotted on
the streets.
   ``That did it,'' a police spokesman said. ``The guns fell
silent.''
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976, the year after Lebanon's civil
war began.
   The police spokesman, whose name cannot be used under standing
regulations, said the Syrians were ``searching everything coming
out from both neighborhoods, where most of the hostages are thought
to be imprisoned _ even funeral processions and caskets.''
   Syrian soldiers have not tried to storm any suspected hideouts
of kidnappers, apparently for fear of killing hostages.
   Seventeen Westerners are missing in Lebanon and believed to be
hostages, including eight Americans.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, has been held longest. He was abducted five years ago, on
March 16, 1985.
   The captives have been moved often, in car trunks or coffins,
either to escape fighting among Shiite factions or to avoid
detection.
   French journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann, freed in 1988, said he
nearly suffocated in a box that was slung beneath a truck.
   Anderson, 42, was said to have been chained to a basement wall
of a ruined Beirut hotel during his early days as a captive.
   Freed hostages have said they, too, were held in basements, or
sometimes in upper-floor apartments with no access to windows.
   All said they heard jet planes landing and taking off, which
supports the belief that most hostages are in the southern slums
near Beirut's airport.
   Shiites claiming to be close to the kidnappers often have
approached news agencies in Beirutoffering to help free Anderson or
Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, in return for as much as $1
million for each hostage. None of the offers was believed to be
legitimate.
   Waite, 50, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his hotel in
Moslem west Beirut to negotiate for the freedom of Anderson and
other Americans.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran has asked pro-Iranian
factions in Lebanon grouped under the umbrella of Hezbollah, or
Party of God, to free the hostages. But the Shiite sources in
Beirut believe Rafsanjani has little influence with the militant
Hezbollah wing that controls the hostage-holders.
   Hezbollah militants are loyal to Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, the
hard-line former interior minister of Iran, who helped found
Hezbollah while he was Iran's ambassador to Syria in the early
1980s. Anderson is held by a group calling itself Islamic Jihad, or
Islamic Holy War.
   ``Rafsanjani's hostage behests are a cry without an echo,'' said
a senior Shiite source. ``Rafsanjani wants a deal with the United
States to unblock Tehran's frozen assests to cope with Iran's
economic crisis, which is generating anti-government public
sentiment.
   ``Mohtashemi and other hard-line opposition leaders have a stake
in maintaining the crisis so they can agitate against Rafsanjani,
so no hostages are likely to be released in the near future.''
   The United States holds billions of dollars in Iranian assets
that were frozen after the storming of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
in 1979. Fifty-two Americans were held 444 days.
   Rafsanjani and other Iranian leaders have said Iran would help
get the hostages in Lebanon released if the United States freed the
assets.
   This week, Mohtashemi said some of the captives were spies and
argued against freeing any of the ``mercenary U.S. hostages.''
   Support for the hard-liners came March 6 when a group holding
American hostages Joseph Cicippio and Edward Austin Tracy broke a
seven-month silence to say no captives were about to be freed.
   ``There is no intention to release hostages,'' said the
Revolutionary Justice Organization, which also threatened suicide
attacks on U.S. interests.
   Shiite sources said the next hostage release might come from
Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, which holds American
college teachers Robert Polhill, Alann Steen and Jesse Turner.
   Hussein Mousawi, a pro-Syrian activist based in the Bekaa Valley
of east Lebanon, now controls the group. The sources said
Mohtashemi loyalists recently removed Mousawi from the Hezbollah
leadership.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration expressed regret
Thursday but did not join the strong European condemnation over
Iraq's execution of a British-based journalist accused of spying.
   The White House, in a mild reaction to the hanging of of Farzad
Bazoft, avoided further comment, saying ``we don't have any way to
make a judgment on the case.''
   Iraq accused the 31-year-old journalist of spying for Britain
and Israel. Bazoft, who emigrated from his native Iran as a
teenager in 1975, wrote for the British weekly The Observer and
traveled on British documents.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``He of course was
the subject of international clemency pleas. We regret those were
unheeded. But we don't have a lot of details on the case itself.''
   Asked if the United States shared the British government's view
that this was ``barbarous,'' Fitzwater said, ``We don't have any
independent conclusions about the case itself or the trial.''
   He said he did not expect to have any further reaction to the
hanging, saying, ``He was not a U.S. citizen.''
   Bazoft was convicted Saturday by a revolutionary court in a
closed trial. He was arrested in September near the the
Al-Iskandaria military complex south of Baghdad where ballistic
missiles are reportedly being developed. He was investigating
reports that hundreds of people had died in an explosion.
   The execution came despite pleas for clemency from Britain, U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Amnesty International,
the European Community and international press groups.
   Iraq said Bazoft signed confessions to being a spy. He had made
six reporting trips to Iraq.

   Lawmakers from both parties urged President
Bush on Thursday to provide aid to the African National Congress
and other organizations in South Africa to help them prepare for
negotiations to end apartheid.
   Bush met with eight House members recently returned from South
Africa, where they met with President F.W. de Klerk and ANC leader
Nelson Mandela.
   House Majority Whip William H. Gray III, D-Pa., the delegation
leader, said that the United States should aid the anti-apartheid
parties in South Africa just as it has helped emerging democracies
in Eastern Europe and elsewhere.
   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., suggested U.S. aid ``in the
vicinity of $10 million.''
   ``Clearly the African National Organization would be one
organization that would qualify for such funding, but it wouldn't
be the only one,'' Solarz said.
   ``Just as we've taken initiatives like this for Nicaragua, for
Poland, for the Philippines, for Chile and other countries, the
time has now come for us to act in a similar fashion in South
Africa as well,'' said Solarz.
   The lawmakers, including such longtime advocates of stiffer
sanctions on South Africa as Reps. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., and
Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., said it was time to ``pause'' before
imposing new sanctions on de Klerk's government.
   Mandela, freed from prison last month after 27 years, this week
called on Western nations to intensify sanctions.
   ``We thought it was an appropriate time to pause in the effort
at imposing additional sanctions,'' said Wolpe, chairman of the
House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa. ``But at the same
time, we also felt it was very important to maintain existing
sanctions in place.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will leave on a trip to
southern Africa on Sunday. He will attend a presidential
inauguration in Namibia and is expected to confer with de Klerk in
Cape Town. Baker is also seeking to arrange a meeting with Mandela.
   Rep. Dean A. Gallo, R-N.Y., the co-chairman of the delegation,
said the lawmakers came back from Cape Town with ``guarded
optimism'' about the future of South Africa.
   Gray said Bush ``reiterated that he wanted to maintain
bipartisan foreign policy in southern Africa,'' but made no
commitment to an aid package.
   Solarz said the United States should not have any compunctions
about aiding the ANC, which advocates armed resistance.
   ``The commitment of an organization to the use of armed struggle
as a tactic for the establishment of democracy has not precluded us
from providing aid to UNITA in Angola or to the Contras in
Nicaragua,'' said Solarz. ``I think the administration has crossed
that conceptual Rubicon a long time ago.''

   Vice President Dan Quayle found himself
in a bit of a diplomatic pickle when the president of Paraguay gave
him a pair of cuddly jaguar cubs _ members of an endangered species.
   It was decided that diplomatic protocol required Quayle to
accept the cubs, which he was given while visiting Asuncion on
Monday, and then try to give them to a zoo, said a Quayle aide
speaking only on condition of anonymity.
   ``We learned about them three days before the trip started. We
tried to discourage it. We were told the president had his heart
set on it,'' the aide told reporters.
   But the National Zoo in Washington wouldn't take the jaguars
because of their endangered-species status, and an environmental
group called Quayle's office to protest their being taken from the
wild.
   So on Thursday, at the presidential inauguration in Brasilia,
Quayle sent Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson to give
the bad news to an aide of Paraguayan President Andres Rodriguez.
   Aronson told the Paraguayan that Quayle ``would prefer that the
jaguars be released into the wilds of Paraguay to benefit future
generations of Paraguayans,'' the aide said.
   Why had Rodriguez insisted on giving the cubs as a gift? ``He
knows they're extremely rare. They are prized in the United
States,'' the aide said.
   However, the United Nations has passed a resolution condemning
the use of endangered species as gifts.
   In Paraguay, Quayle's staff had set up a photo session for the
traveling press corps to photograph Quayle and his wife Marilyn
playing with the cubs at the U.S. ambassador's house in Asuncion.
   There was no indication of how Rodriguez reacted to having his
present spurned.

<HEAD>Museum Refuses to Comment on Interest in van Gogh's `Irises'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MALIBU, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Irises,'' the Vincent van Gogh painting
that sold for a record $53.9 million in 1987, reportedly has been
brought to the J. Paul Getty Museum, which is considering buying it.
   ``The museum isn't commenting,'' Getty spokeswoman Lori Starr
said in response to Wednesday's Los Angeles Times report. Museum
officials would say only that no agreement or purchase had taken
place.
   The owner of the masterpiece, financially troubled Australian
entrepreneur Alan Bond, reportedly has turned down offers of $50
million to $60 million.
   The painting was delivered to the museum, 30 miles west of Los
Angeles, last week, the newspaper said, citing an unidentified
source who saw the painting at the Getty. The pating was last
reported to be at Bond's office in Sydney.
   The New York Times on Thursday quoted museum staff members who
declined to be identified as saying the painting remains at the
museum while negotiations take place involving the Getty, Bond and
Sotheby's auction house.
   Museums often receive artworks before a purchase so curators can
verify the work's authenticity and examine it for possible damage.
   Major acquisitions must be approved by the museum's board of
trustees, several of whom have viewed the painting, the Los Angeles
Times said.
   With a $2.1 billion endowment from the late oil baron J. Paul
Getty, the museum is the world's richest financial institution.
   The 1889 painting, characteristic of van Gogh's bold
postimpressionist style, depicts a field of midnight-blue irises,
except for a single white iris. The landscape is from a corner of
the garden at the asylum of St. Paul de Mausole in St. Remy de
Provence, where the artist committed himself in 1889-90.
   Bond acquired the painting Nov. 11, 1987, at Sotheby's,
reportedly financing the record auction price with a $27 million
loan from the auction house, which accepted the painting as
collateral in an unusual transaction.
   The highly leveraged acquisition, similar to Wall Street
takeover deals of whole corporations during the 1980s, was widely
criticized for inflating prices in the international art market.
   The extraordinary prices paid for art in recent years also have
placed many works beyond the acquisition budgets of art museums.
   Since Bond's financial empire began crumbling under the weight
of more than $5 billion in debt, there has been widespread
speculation among art curators, dealers and collectors about the
fate of ``Irises.''
   The painting was in private European collections until 1947,
when it was purchased for $80,000 by New York philanthropist Joan
Whitney Payson. After a version of van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' sold
for $39.9 million in 1987, Payson decided to sell ``Irises'' and
use the proceeds to endow a charitable foundation.

<TEXT>
   A college freshman who fell to his death
in a sport called ``elevator surfing'' was the latest casualty of a
little-known but dangerous practice that has plagued high-rises for
years, officials say.
   Sometimes called ``elevator action,'' or ``piloting an
elevator,'' the hazardous exercise involves climbing atop elevator
cars, either through a trapdoor in the car's roof or by jamming
doors open from a floor above the car, and riding on the roofs.
   ``We've taken it terribly seriously. We've been fighting it for
a long time,'' said Val Coleman, director of public information for
the New York City Housing Authority. Ten deaths and more than 50
injuries have been reported in New York during the past five years,
he said.
   ``It's a very serious problem in our high-rise buildings,'' said
Coleman, who worked on a recently released cautionary videotape on
the issue called ``Children are Too Young to Die.''
   At Otis Elevator Co., the nation's largest elevator
manufacturer, officials have known about the dangerous games for
some time, said Michael Jordan-Reilly, spokesman for the Hartford,
Conn.-based company.
   ``This is one of our major concerns,'' he said.
   At the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 18-year-old Joel
Mangion of Newton was found dead at the bottom of an elevator shaft
Sunday. Friends said he had been ``elevator surfing,'' jumping from
one car to another in the double shaft.
   About a year ago, a student suffered serious injuries after
falling 30 feet in a shaft, university officials said. In the early
1970s, a student died after riding in a chair tied to the bottom of
a car.
   Students said they have heard of the practice, although it isn't
something most people try.
   ``Usually on the weekends when people are drunk, you hear about
someone who went `elevator surfing,''' student Susan Beckett told
the campus newspaper, The Collegian.
   Donald A. Robinson, director of environmental health and safety
for UMass, said officials are looking for new ways to discourage
elevator surfing.
   ``The message needs to be made very clear how elevators should
be used and not misused and to really emphasize the obvious
significant consequences,'' he said. ``We are really trying to take
a hard look at all the issues and make all efforts to make sure it
doesn't happen again.''
   Industry officials said it's difficult to determine the extent
of the problem because elevator deaths are not reported to a
central agency. Jordan-Reilly said the problem has probably existed
``as long as there have been elevators and as long as there have
been people who want to try something dangerous.''

<TEXT>
   Fidel Castro said Cuba has no need for
Soviet-style reforms but that relations between Cuba and the Soviet
Union have not been hurt by his rejection of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
``perestroika.''
   ``Cuba is not the Soviet Union. We are different countries with
different origins,'' the Cuban president said Wednesday in an
interview with TV Globo, Brazil's largest network. He was in Brazil
for the inauguration of President Fernando Collor de Mello.
   Castro has remained adamant in his refusal to accept the reforms
increasingly embraced in the East bloc, and he showed no sign of
wavering in the interview.
   The revolutionary leader said he still has ``the most profound
conviction that for Cuba there is no solution superior, or path
better'' than socialism.
   Despite his differences with Gorbachev on reform, there are no
fundamental problems in relations between the two countries, Castro
said.
   ``I wouldn't speak of ideological differences, but different
paths that respond to different situations,'' he said.
   ``Our economic relations with the Soviet Union are perfectly
well,'' Castro added. Even if aid from the Soviet Union was
reduced, Cuba's economy would not suffer seriously, he claimed.
   Castro also said he saw no need for Western-style elections in
Cuba.
   ``We have our own type of election...It would take long to
explain our (political) process, but we could have a debate to see
which is more democratic, what we have in Cuba or another type,''
he said.
   Congresses of Cuba's ruling Communist Party choose the country's
leadership. There are no popular elections.

   Vice President Dan Quayle said Thursday
he wants ``anyone who has contact'' with Cuban President Fidel
Castro to urge him to hold elections.
   Quayle also repeated his call for Cuba to halt arms shipments to
rebels fighting the U.S.-backed government of El Salvador.
   But the vice president himself avoided contact with Castro at
Thursday's inauguration of Brazil's new president.
   Quayle told a news conference he had discussed the matter of
Cuba with other Latin leaders during his week-long trip through
South America.
   ``We have encouraged all people who have any contact with Fidel
Castro to urge him to stop the war in El Salvador, to stop
funding'' the well-organized guerilla movement.
   Asked what he had discussed with Nicaragua's outgoing President
Daniel Ortega the day before, Quayle said that the disarmament of
Ortega's ruling Sandinistas when they leave power is a matter of
concern to the United States.
   ``There are reports that many arms are being shipped out to the
Sandinistas that are taking them to their homes or taking them to
the hills, ready to fight again at another time. That would be a
most unfortunate development,'' with the pending transfer of power
to Violeta Chamorro, who defeated Ortega in the Feb. 25 election.
   At the inauguration, Castro entered the hall just ahead of
Quayle and was immediately surrounded as he made his way up the
crowded aisle to his front-row seat.
   Quayle trailed several yards back. He greeted a few people in
the aisle and edged past the clot around Castro to his own seat
four places down the front row.
   In his news conference before leaving Brazil, Quayle continued a
drumbeat against Castro.
   ``We also urge anyone who is in contact with Castro to ask him
when he's going to have elections. ... Elections have been held
elsewhere in Latin America and Cuba should be no exception.''
   Quayle spoke about Cuba in talks Thursday with Collor and with
Bolivia's president, Jaime Paz Zamora, who sat next to Castro at
the inauguration.
   Castro, flanked on the other side by a representative of the
Vatican, chatted frequently with Paz Zamora during Collor's lengthy
speech.
   Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith, said Quayle had asked
Collor to urge Castro to bring democracy to Cuba. Quayle earlier
won assurances from President Carlos Menem that Argentina would try
to exert pressure on Castro as well.
   Quayle is due to return to Washington on Friday.

   The man who salvaged the Exxon Valdez
said today that Joseph Hazelwood acted professionally after the
tanker ran aground on a reef and was clearly trying to keep it
stable until help arrived.
   ``What he did was very professional. It reflects his training,''
said Julius Leitz, a marine salvager from Portland, Ore.
``Everything he did was aimed at keeping the vessel on the rock,
which was the prudent thing to do.''
   Leitz, called by Hazelwood's defense team, disputed the
testimony of several prosecution experts, including another
salvager who said the ship would have sunk if it was extricated
from a reef in Prince William Sound.
   ``I disagree,'' said Leitz. ``It wouldn't have sunk.''
   He added that speculation on the subject was pointless, because,
``that's all assuming the ship would leap off the rocks. I don't
think that would happen.''
   The witness said the tanker would have required levitation to
come off the rocks where it was impaled March 24.
   Defense attorney Michael Chalos led the witness through a series
of questions concerning Hazelwood's immediate actions after his
ship rammed the reef. After each question he asked whether
Hazelwood's actions were prudent or inprudent.
   ``Prudent,'' the witness answered repeatedly.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is the only Exxon Valdez
crew member charged in the grounding which caused the nation's
worst oil spill. The tanker rammed jagged Bligh Reef, gashing its
hull and spewing nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska crude oil in a
spill which devastated fisheries, wildlife and the scenic shores of
Prince William Sound.
   The former skipper is charged with a felony, criminal mischief,
and three misdemeanors, reckless endangerment, operating a vessel
while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil. If convicted he
could be sentenced to 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   On Wednesday, an Exxon tanker captain who once sailed with
Hazelwood gave him high marks for seamanship on the day of the
grounding, but said he might not have imbibed as Hazelwood did
before boarding his ship.
   Ivan Mihajlovic, testifying in Hazelwood's defense, said he
found no fault with the skipper's navigation nor with his decision
to leave the bridge while his tanker crossed Alaska's Prince
William Sound.
   On cross-examination, Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole
gave the witness a prosecution scenario in which Hazelwood had five
drinks during seven hours ashore in Valdez on March 23, the day his
ship sailed. The accident happened in the early morning hours of
March 24.
   ``Do you have an opinion whether that is proper conduct for an
Exxon master?'' asked Cole.
   ``That's probably something I wouldn't do,'' said Mihajlovic.
   Chalos objected to the question because of a dispute in
testimony as to how much Hazelwood actually drank.
   But Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone said Cole was entitled
to ask questions ``based on his view of the evidence.''
   Chalos then asked: ``You said your own personal preference
wouldn't be to drink ashore. Does the fact someone else would
(drink) make it improper?''
   ``No,'' responded the witness.
   Mihajlovic was among the final witnesses in the defense case,
which is expected to conclude by week's end.
   Prosecutors maintain that Hazelwood was reckless in leaving the
bridge in control of a third mate during a transit they claim was
hazardous.
   But Mijalovic said he doesn't consider Prince William Sound
hazardous and noted he has left the bridge of his own vessel in
that area.
   He said there is no regulation requiring a captain be on the
bridge for the transit and said the only such regulation in
existence is for the Panama Canal.
   Like other seagoing witnesses, Mihajlovic was asked to assess
the difficulty of a 10-degree right rudder turn, the missed
maneuver that apparently let the Exxon Valdez drift into the reef.
   ``Oh, I'm sure nobody here could do that,'' the witness said,
looking around the courtroom. ``Just put them on a ship.''
   The judge recessed court a half-hour early Wednesday after
hearing that Redoubt Volcano had erupted again and ash might be
drifting toward Anchorage. ``We're going to let you get a jump on
the volcano,'' he told jurors.

   A lawyer for savings and loan financier
Charles H. Keating Jr. bragged in a 1988 letter released Thursday
that she had pressured federal regulators.
   ``You have the (Federal Home Loan Bank) board right where you
want them and you should be able to reach an agreement ... which
will completely satisfy you,'' Washington lawyer Margery Waxman
wrote in the May 10, 1988, letter.
   Waxman, who was referring to an upcoming meeting with board
officials, told Keating she had ``put pressure on'' M. Danny Wall,
chairman of the bank board and then chief regulator of thrift
institutions.
   House Banking Committee Chairman Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,
D-Texas, who released the letter, said it strongly suggests ``the
fix was in at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.''
   Banking panel aides refused to say how they obtained the letter.
   Keating is chairman of a holding company that owned Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association, Irvine, Calif. It failed in April and
is expected to require the nation's costliest S&amp;L bailout, about $2
billion.
   At the time the letter was sent, Keating was fighting federal
efforts to rein in his institution. Bank board examiners based in
San Francisco had recommended that the government seize Lincoln and
Keating had appealed to authorities in Washington.
   ``As you know, I have put pressure on Wall to work toward
meeting your demands and he has so instructed his staff,'' Waxman
wrote. ``They all know the Wednesday meeting is crucial to their
future. If they mess up this time, it is all over.''
   The letter was written five days after a divided bank board
decided to move the Lincoln case from the jurisdiction of its San
Francisco office to Washington and on the same day Wall had a
telephone conversation with Keating.
   Waxman outlined what she expected to be the result of the
meeting, including a new examination of Lincoln and memorandum of
understanding between the institution and regulators, which was
executed five days later.
   ``San Francisco is finished,'' she assured Keating. ``There is
no going back to San Francisco and nothing can be done to follow up
their exam.''
   In the new exam, she said, ``nothing will be done ... that you
are not aware of in advance.''
   Also, she told Keating that bank board personnel ``will not be
able to enforce any violation (of the memorandum of understanding)
... without going to the board first. ... This will give you two
bites at the apple _ before the board and in court if necessary.''
   ``The letter, written in strong declarative language, tracks
with amazing accuracy the actions taken by the board _ actions
which were interpreted publicly as clamping down on Lincoln,''
Gonzalez said. ``In reality, as the letter carefully explains, the
actions were to be shams designed not to punish but to allow
Keating an escape route.''
   Neither Wall nor Waxman immediately returned telephone calls
seeking comment. Rosemary Stewart, enforcement director of the bank
board, declined to comment immediately.
   The letter indicates it was telecopied to Keating in Phoenix.
Its existence was first disclosed in stories in Thursday's editions
of the San Francisco Chronicle.

<HEAD>European Parliament: U.S. Must Pay Compensation to Nicaragua</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Parliament Thursday
adopted a resolution calling on the United States to pay Nicaragua
compensation for damage caused in attacks by the U.S.-armed Contra
rebels.
   The decision was in support of a June 1986 ruling by the
International Court of Justice in The Hague. That ruling said U.S.
support for the Contra rebels was in violation of the United
Nations Charter and constituted ``unlawful use of force.''
   The court, also known as the World Court, called on the U.S. to
compensate Nicaragua for rebel attacks but said the amount of
payment should be decided between the two sides.
   At the time of the decision, Nicaragua said rebel damage
amounted to $375 million. The U.S. has refused to accept the
ruling, which is not binding.
   The European Parliament welcomed Wednesday's decision by
President Bush to give Nicaragua $300 million in aid and lift a
trade embargo, but it demanded the disbanding of the rebels.
   The U.S. moves followed the victory in presidential elections of
the U.S.-backed candidate.
   The European Parliament called on the U.S. Congress to guarantee
Nicaraguan exports access to the U.S. market.
   The statements were made in a resolution adopted by the 518-seat
assembly of the European Community.
   The resolution was presented by all of the parliament's
political groups, except for the extreme right-wing. It said
demobilization of the Contra rebels was ``particularly urgent...in
order that the largest possible proportion of available economic
and human resources can be devoted to economic and social
development.''
   The parliament also called on the European Community to
strengthen its political and economic cooperation with Central
America to show ``our partners that the economic consequences of
the current events in Central and Eastern Europe do not imply a
reduction in European financial support for Central America.''

<HEAD>U.S. Protests Soviet Refusal to Allow Use of Missile-Spotting
X-ray Gear</HEAD>

   The United States is pushing the Soviet Union
to allow X-ray inspections of sealed missile cannisters, as
required by the treaty banning medium-range missiles, the State
Department said Thursday.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that the Soviets are refusing
to permit U.S. inspectors to use a ``Cargoscan'' X-ray device at
the missile-production facility at Votkinsk and that some missile
cannisters subsequently have been shipped without being inspected.
   She said U.S. inspectors at Votkinsk, nearly 700 miles east of
Moscow, have declared the refusal an ``ambiguity,'' which she
called ``the most serious action our inspectors can take'' under
the on-site inspection provisions of the 1987 Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces Treaty, which bans missiles with ranges of 300 to
3,400 miles.
   ``The U.S. regards any question of compliance with the INF
treaty as a very serious matter,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``We are
continuing to press the Soviets to solve this problem by allowing
us to use the Cargoscan system.''
   American and Soviet technical teams have been dispatched to the
plant to examine the Cargoscan system, which the United States says
meets the treaty's requirements for a non-damaging X-ray device
able to determine what is inside a missile cannister.
   The U.S. team hopes to demonstrate that the equipment works as
specified and to answer the Soviets' technical questions, she said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker has protested the Soviet
action to Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who agreed that
the issue needs to be resolved as soon as possible, Ms. Tutwiler
said.
   Former President Reagan, who signed the treaty with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in December 1987, earlier accused
the Soviets of violating previous arms control accords.
   The INF treaty, therefore, contained a complex on-site
verification system designed to respond to skeptics in Congress who
said the Soviets were likely to cheat.
   Mrs. Tutwiler said the Soviets claim the Cargoscan equipment is
not yet operating in compliance with the agreement.
   ``As a result, they (the Soviets) recently shipped a number of
missile cannisters from the production facility at the plant
without allowing U.S. inspectors to use Cargoscan equipment.''
   She declined to say how many missiles had been shipped.
   The United States wants to examine cannisters said to contain
SS-25 missiles, permitted by the treaty, to make sure they do not
contain SS-20 missiles, forbidden by the pact.
   The SS-25 is a variation of the SS-20 and the scanning equipment
is said to be able to tell the two apart.
   The Soviets do not have X-ray imaging equipment at U.S. missile
production plants in the United States because U.S. missiles are
not shipped in cannisters, she said.

<HEAD>No Lodging Deduction When Doctor's Care Not at Hand</HEAD>

   Lodging expenses for health-related travel are
tax-deductible only if necessary to obtain a physician's care, the
U.S. Tax Court has ruled.
   Merely traveling on a doctor's recommendation to a more
favorable climate to alleviate a specific ailment is not enough to
justify a deduction, the court held; the travel must be essential
to care provided by a doctor in a hospital or similar facility.
   The ruling earlier this week was the first time the court had
considered a 1984 law that in certain situations allows lodging
costs to be included in deductible medical expenses.
   The court case involved Earlene Polyak of Trenton, Mich., who
suffered from chronic heart, artery and lung problems. Following
her doctors' advice, she began spending winters in Florida, living
in a travel trailer while her husband stayed at their home in
Michigan.
   Her physicians did not refer Mrs. Polyak to any doctors in
Florida, and she visited a doctor only twice during her five months
there.
   She and her husband claimed a medical deduction for $1,426 they
spent to rent a campground lot for the trailer but were turned down
by the Internal Revenue Service.
   The new law was written to benefit people who must travel away
from home because specialized care is not available locally or, in
the case of some chemotherapy treatment for cancer, for example,
may be obtained on an out-patient basis at a considerably lower
cost.
   In siding with the IRS against Mrs. Polyak, Senior Judge William
A. Goffe noted the new law permits deduction of transportation
costs in such cases so long as it is ``primarily for and essential
to medical care.'' But lodging expenses must pass a three-part test:
   _They must be primarily for and essential to medical care;
   _The care must be provided by a physician in a licensed hospital
or equivalent facility, and
   _The travel and lodging must hold ``no significant element of
personal pleasure, recreation or vacation.''
   Goffe concluded that Mrs. Polyak passed the first and third
tests but failed the second.
   ``Mrs. Polyak did not go to Florida to seek medical care from a
physician,'' Goffe wrote. ``The medical treatment received by Mrs.
Polyak was incidental and of routine nature.''

   Pop singer Janet Jackson's benefit
concert only raised $11,000 for charities because expenses ate up
most of the proceeds, organizers said.
   The $11,000 was about 15 percent of the $76,000 gross and will
be split between a soup kitchen and food bank that serve the
homeless, said Doug Clouse, a spokesman for Ogden Allied Presents,
which manages the Pensacola Civic Center. Other charities will get
nothing, he said.
   ``The rest of the money went for expenses for the show: labor,
staff, putting the tickets on sale,'' Clouse said Wednesday.
   Representatives of charities disagreed about whether they had
been promised shares of the proceeds from the Feb. 27 $10-a-ticket
concert.
   ``I don't want Janet Jackson to be perceived as going back on
her word because she has not,'' said Lee Esckilsen, the civic
center's executive director. ``They dropped close to a million
dollars into the local economy. At least 8,000 people got to see a
great show. Plus she's contributing to charitable organizations.''
   Ms. Jackson started her world tour March 1 in Miami.

   New York Mets outfielder Darryl Strawberry has
been ordered to pay $40,000 in back payments and $2,000 a month to
support his son.
   The money will be divided between Lisa Clayton of St. Louis, the
child's mother, and Thomas J. Frawley, who was appointed a
conservator for the boy.
   St. Louis County Circuit Judge Philip J. Sweeney said the
purpose of appointing a conservator was to assure that money would
be available for the child's education. The child was born in June
1988.
   Sweeney's order noted that Strawberry earns $110,000 a month.
   Strawberry, 28, is seeking a new contract that would pay him $12
million over four years. The Mets have countered with $2.5 million
a year for two years.
   At a hearing in January, Stuart Cofman, Clayton's attorney,
introduced blood tests to support the claim that Strawberry was the
father of the child. Strawberry did not contest the findings.

   West German film director Werner Herzog's career
is hitting a different note: He's planning to direct a new
production of Mozart's ``The Magic Flute'' for the Metropolitan
Opera.
   Herzog's version of ``Die Zauberflote'' is to open Jan. 10, Met
officials said. It is to be conducted by James Levine and features
Kathleen Battle as Pamina, Francisco Araiza as Tamino, Kurt Moll as
Sarastro, Luciana Serra as the Queen of the Night and Manfred Hemm
as Papageno.
   ``Die Zauberflote'' is one of four Mozart operas the Met is
presenting in its 1990-91 season as part of the Lincoln Center's
Mozart Bicentennial series, marking the 200th anniversary of the
composer's death. The Met plans to perform seven Mozart operas in
1991.
   Herzog is known for such films as ``Burden of Dreams,'' ``Man of
Flowers'' and ``Aguirre, the Wrath of God.'' Herzog, Rainer Werner
Fassbinder and Volker Schloendorff were among the directors who
helped make German cinema known internationally during the 1960s
and '70s.

   Composer Michael Tilson Thomas says he hears
the sad but hopeful echos of the past in Audrey Hepburn's reading
from the diary of Anne Frank.
   Thomas, whose grandparents Boris and Bessie Thomashefsky were
founders and stars of the Yiddish Theater of America, said he used
Miss Frank's writings as a framework for his newest composition,
``Concerts for Life.''
   The first of four concerts, to benefit UNICEF, will be Monday
night at Philadelphia's Academy of Music.
   The program begins with Brahms' ``Academic Festival Overture''
and ends with Prokofiev's Symphony No. 5. In between is Thomas'
``From The Diary of Anne Frank,'' narrated by Miss Hepburn, who is
UNICEF's goodwill ambassador.
   The heart of the project is Miss Frank's diary, which chronicles
the young Jewish girl's feelings as she and her family hid from
Nazis for two years in the attic of an Amsterdam office building.
   Overall, Thomas said, he finds his own creation ``expressive,
hopeful and the bright, shining spirit of the innocence of Anne
Frank comes through.''
   ``To hear them, to hear the fine, delicate phrasing she gives
... with the music providing the fabric, it's as if you were
listening in to Anne Frank herself,'' Thomas said of Miss Hepburn.
   The program also will be performed in Chicago on March 21, in
Houston on March 23 and at the United Nations General Assembly on
March 25.

<TEXT>
   The Vatican and the Soviet Union established
diplomatic ties Thursday for the first time since the founding of
the communist state 74 years ago.
   The Vatican and Moscow said the two sides have agreed to
exchange representatives with the rank of apostolic nuncio, or
papal envoy, and extraordinary ambassador.
   The ties fall short of full diplomatic relations. Vatican
spokesman Joaquin Navarro described them as ``pre-diplomatic
relations'' and said there was ``room for further development.'' He
gave no indication when ties might be upgraded.
   There are a number of problems to be resolved, including the
status of the Ukrainian Catholic Church. It was suppressed under
Soviet dictator Josef Stalin and incorporated into the Russian
Orthodox Church.
   Still, the move was an extraordinary advance in relations
between the center of the Roman Catholic Church and a state that
declared war against religion after the Bolshevik revolution of
1917.
   It also reflects the vastly improved climate in relations
between the church and Soviet bloc countries since the collapse of
hard-line Communist leaderships.
   Relations have steadily improved under Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. The decision to establish ties came during his talks
with the pope at the Vatican on Dec. 1. It was the first meeting
between a Roman pontiff and a supreme Soviet leader.
   Initially, the two representatives will not have permanent
residences.
   But Navarro said the papal nuncio could decide to keep an
assistant in Moscow if he thought it was needed.
   The Vatican will be represented by Archbishop Francesco
Colasuonno, an Italian prelate who has been a roving Vatican envoy
to Eastern Europe.
   The name of the Soviet ambassador was not immediately announced.
   The Vatican and Moscow had diplomatic relations under the
Russian czars, but those ties were broken when the Communists came
to power.
   One of the main points of friction between Moscow and Rome has
been the Ukrainian church.
   It would regain legal status under a proposed freedom of
religion law promised by Gorbachev when he met with the pope. But
as yet the measure has not been adopted.
   Gorbachev also invited the pope to the Soviet Union, but the
Vatican gave no indication when John Paul would accept the
invitation.
   The pope had previously been barred from visiting his flock in
Lithuania. The situation could be further complicated by the
republic's recent declaration of independence from the Soviet Union.
   Over the past few months, in a further sign of the improved
Vatican-Soviet relations, John Paul has received a number of Soviet
visitors. A Soviet journalist for the first time traveled on the
pope's plane on an African pilgrimage in January.
   In the past year, full relations were reestablished with Poland,
the pope's homeland, and Hungary. John Paul visits Czechoslovakia
next month.
   On Wednesday, the Vatican restored the leadership of the
long-persecuted Roman Catholic Church in Romania and revived the
Eastern rite branch that was suppressed there in 1948. Its
situation was similar to that of the Ukrainian Catholic church.

   A Moslem extremist group holding three
American professors hostage threatened Thursday to kill them if the
United States fails to meet its unspecified demands.
   The group, the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine,
also threatened to attack airlines that carry Soviet Jewish
immigrants to Israel.
   It said individuals and organizations who recently said the
hostages should be freed on humanitarian grounds should stay out of
the affair.
   The organization, believed made up of Shiite Moslem zealots
loyal to Iran, made the threats in a statement delivered the
independent newspaper An-Nahar.
   The statement was accompanied by a photograph of Professor
Robert Polhill, one of three American educators kidnapped from the
campus of the U.S.-affiliated Beirut University College on Jan. 24,
1987.
   The other two are Alann Steen, 49, of Boston, and Jesse Turner,
41, of Boise, Idaho. Polhill, a New Yorker, is 54.
   The statement was the first from groups holding foreign hostages
since March 6, when a group holding Americans Joseph Cicippio and
Edward Austin Tracy broke a seven-month silence to say no captives
were about to be freed.
   ``There is no intention to release hostages,'' said the
Revolutionary Justice Organization, which also threatened suicide
attacks on U.S. interests.
   There are 18 foreign hostages, including eight Americans.
   Friday marks the fifth year in captivity for the longest-held
American hostage, Terry A. Anderson. The 42-year-old chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Thursday's handwritten statement in Arabic said: ``The
organization of Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine
denounces media reports about humanitarian moves to free the
hostages and close this file.
   ``It asks the authors of these moves not to interfere in this
matter because we are holding agents and spies against our people,
and they will be executed if the American administration fails to
meet our demands.''
   Iran's Tehran Times newspaper, which has close ties to President
Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran, said in two recent editorials that the
hostages should be freed on Islamic, humanitarian grounds.
Rafsanjani himself said he believed the issue was moving toward a
solution.
   Sheikh Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual guide of Lebanon's
Hezbollah, or Party of God, also said in a February sermon that a
humanitarian means of freeing the hostages had to be found.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the Shiite Moslem umbrella
organization for the extremist groups holding the 18 foreign
hostages in Lebanon.
   The statement Thursday did not spell out the demands the
kidnappers expected the Bush administration to meet.
   The group had previously offered to trade the three professors
for 400 Arab prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel rejected the offer
and the Reagan administration refused to pressure Israel to change
its stance.
   ``We did not carry out the death sentences because we are
waiting for the appropriate time,'' the statement said, without
mentioning a specific deadline.
   The statement said:
   ``We have laid down the trap and are eagerly waiting for the
promised American adventure to free them (hostages) by force.
   ``We announce that there is no solution for and no deal about
this issue except within the framework of exchanges.''
   The statement accused the United States of responsibility for
the current emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel ``after pressure on
the Soviets who succumbed and collaborated in this big conspiracy.''
   ``Our people shall not stand handcuffed in front of this
conspiracy. We shall not stand by watching, but shall begin taking
the adequate measures to prevent the arrival of the Soviets,'' the
statement added.
   ``All airports facilitating the transport as well as airlines,
their jetliners and offices, will be direct targets for us. This is
a warning and a threat,'' the statement said.
   Hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews are expected in Israel in
the coming years as the Soviet Union has lifted all their
restrictions on leaving.
   The influx has created an uproar in the Arab world.
   It caused fears that the Soviet Jews would settle in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where Palestinians hope one day
to create a homeland.
   The fate of the hostages has often been linked to developments
in the Middle East in the past, but this was apparently the first
time they were tied to the issue of Soviet Jewish immigration.
   The 18 hostages include eight Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans, two Swiss, and Irishman and an Italian.
   Their fate at the hands of Iranian-backed groups is believed
linked to a power struggle in Tehran between moderates who seek
better ties with the West and radicals that seek to confront it.
   Rafsanjani, leader of the moderate camp, has made several
statements in the past about wanting to see the hostages freed. But
he is believed to have little influence over the extremist groups
holding them.

   President Fernando Collor de Mello
was born into a wealthy land-owning family in Brazil's near-feudal
northeast, but in his inaugural speech Thursday he pledged to work
for the poor.
   ``My first commitment _ inalterable _ is to democracy. I have a
sacred commitment ... to improve social conditions,'' the tall,
trim president said.
   Foreign dignitaries ranging from Vice President Dan Quayle to
presidents Fidel Castro of Cuba and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua
looked on.
   Yet Collor de Mello, the first popularly elected head of Latin
America's largest country in 29 years, won office speaking in favor
of a free market, private ownership of state companies and an open
door for foreign investment.
   During the election campaign, his leftist opponents called him a
``test-tube candidate'' and a ``mouthpiece for the right.'' They
charged his candidacy was paid for by powerful Brazilian business
and media interests.
   But Collor de Mello insisted he was his own man. He rejected
backing from powerful Sao Paulo business group and tried to
maintain a discreet distance from the massive Globo media empire,
which nevertheless openly supported him.
   Collor de Mello was born Aug. 12, 1949, into a powerful media
and land-owning clan in Alagoas. It is a poor state in northeastern
Brazil dominated by sugar-plantation barons and still known for its
bloody family feuds.
   His father, the late Arnon de Mello, a governor and senator,
shot and killed a colleague on the Senate floor in 1963.
   Collor de Mello was raised in a wealthy neighborhood of Rio de
Janeiro. When Brasilia became Brazil's capital in 1960, he moved
there with his father, lived in a mansion and later became the
city's karate champion.
   He earned college degrees in economics and journalism.
   In 1975 he married Rio heiress and socialite Lilibeth Monteiro
de Carvalho. They had two children and later divorced.
   In 1984 he married Rosane Malta, a hometown girl from another
Alagoas clan, then barely out of high school _ now Brazil's first
lady at age 25.
   Collor de Mello entered politics in 1979 when _ thanks mostly to
his father's connections _ he was appointed mayor of Maceio, the
capital of Alagoas, under a right-wing military regime that seized
power in 1964. Three years later he was elected to Congress on the
ticket of the regime's official Social Democratic Party.
   Collor de Mello was elected governor of Alagoas in 1986. Last
year he formed his own National Reconstruction Party and announced
his bid for the presidency.
   Collor de Mello topped a field of 21 candidates in the Nov. 15,
1989, first-round ballot for president. He then was pitted against
Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, a union leader and former factory worker
in a Dec. 17 runoff, which he won by 4 million votes in a
registered electorate of 82 million.

<HEAD>Darman Presses White House Effort for Budget Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House budget chief sought to lure
Democrats into talks on deficit-reduction on Thursday, telling
lawmakers he has ``tried to switch the emphasis'' away from
President Bush's pledge to not raise taxes.
   Budget director Richard Darman told Congress' Joint Economic
Committee the administration remains opposed to the tax increases
proposed by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., last Sunday as part of a
massive deficit-cutting plan.
   But he said he has tried in his appearances before Congress this
year to avoid focusing on Bush's campaign pledge of ``no new
taxes.''
   ``I've tried to switch the emphasis,'' Darman said. ``Let's talk
about what helps provide economic growth.''
   Many congressional Democrats consider tax increases vital to any
serious effort to reduce the budget deficit, which the
administration expects to be about $120 billion this year. Bush has
repeatedly said he opposes higher taxes, but he and his aides have
hinted in recent days at a possible softening of that position.
   Questioned by Democrats on the committee, Darman even conceded
there are items in Bush's proposed fiscal 1991 budget ``that could
be interpreted as tax increases in a narrow ... sense.''
   Bush's spending plan called for $13.9 billion in new revenues
next year. The new receipts would include extending the Social
Security payroll tax to 7 million uncovered state and local
government workers, by increasing taxes paid by airline passengers
and by raising other fees.
   The budgets for the last three years have been shaped by talks
between congressional leaders and the White House. Many leading
Democrats, unhappy with the results, have said Congress should
shape the spending plan itself this year. But Darman has been
trying for weeks to get congressional Democrats to negotiate.
   ``I continue to believe that the only way to responsible deficit
reduction is through bipartisan agreement,'' Darman said.
   Darman also said he believes Rostenkowski's deficit-cutting
proposal ``would not contribute satisfactorily to economic
growth.'' He added, however, that it would only ``marginally
hinder'' the economy.
   Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,
defended his plan, saying it was preferable to this year's two
other prominent proposals.
   Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., has proposed cutting the Social
Security payroll tax rate, while Bush has continued pressing for a
cut in the capital gains tax rate. Critics have said both would
ultimately boost the federal deficit.
   ``If we lack the collective guts to increase revenues to pay our
bills, I only hope that we are responsible enough to avoid cutting
them and making the deficit worse,'' Rostenkowski told the
Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association in a lunchtime speech.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Thursday
signed a full-power license for the Seabrook nuclear power plant,
ending any chance opponents will be able to prevent it from
operating before court appeals are completed.
   ``This is a major victory for New England consumers,'' said
Edward Brown, president of New Hampshire Yankee, which operates
Seabrook. ``Our 17-year licensing saga is over.''
   But opponents said the legal battle to shut down the plant would
continue.
   ``We have not yet begun to fight,'' said Scott Denman, director
of the Safe Energy Communication Council, an anti-Seabrook group
that has been aiding the legal battle. ``The lawsuit will go on and
the final outcome is yet to be known.''
   Thomas Murley, director of the NRC's Office of Nuclear Reactor
Regulation, made the license official two weeks after the NRC voted
unanimously to allow the New Hampshire plant to operate
commercially. The commission placed a two-week hold on its vote to
allow time for filing court appeals.
   NRC spokesman John Kopeck said Thursday that the license had
been signed.
   The signing came a day after the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington refused to block the issuance of the license. Opponents
argued that evacuation plans for the population around Seabrook are
inadequate.
   The actual granting of the license sets in motion a months-long
process of accelerating the plant to full-power. Brown said plant
officials would need several days to review hundreds of pages of
technical specifications accompanying the license before beginning
the start-up process.
   The plant will generate electricity for the first time within a
few weeks, Brown said.
   After between two to three months of increasing power and a
variety of tests, the $6.5 billion plant would be ready to go into
commercial operation.
   Located along the coast about two miles north of the
Massachusetts border, Seabrook's 1,150 megawatt reactor can power
about a million New England homes.

   It's not all pate and puff pastry when culinary
professionals get together to nosh and share know-how, which is why
their convention this year features country ham, barbecue and other
Dixie delights.
   The International Association of Culinary Professionals,
composed of chefs, cookbook authors and other food aficionados, is
highlighting Southern cooking because the cuisine remains a mystery
to most people outside the region, convention planners say.
   On the agenda for the four-day convention, which wraps up
Saturday, was a workshop tracking the history of Southern food from
South Carolina's Low Country to Louisiana's bayous; a seminar on
creating new dishes from Southern basics with Southern food expert
Nathalie Dupree; and an old-fashioned barbecue that dramatizes
food's social function in the South.
   As cookbook author John Egerton put it: ``Life without a little
South in your mouth ... is a bland and dreary prospect.''
   To commemorate the 100th anniversary of peanut butter,
conventioneers dined on peanut butter soup, beef with a Thai peanut
sauce, and peanut butter cookies, among other dishes. A 12-foot jar
of peanut butter _ enough to make 16,000 sandwiches _ was also on
display, said Mitch Head of the Peanut Advisory Board.
   ``They were coming here to the peanut capital of the world. They
wanted to recognize the peanut's importance to worldwide cuisine,''
Head said of the planners.
   Julia Child, Jacques Pepin and Paul Prudhomme were some of the
cooking celebrities on hand. The IACP has 1,400 members in about 20
countries.

   A pond fountain at the University Center at
Tulsa apparently was not showering amour upon a pair of swans
because the birds refused to consider mating until the water was
turned off.
   Brad Buffum, chief engineer at the school, wondered why the
swans failed to begin their mating rituals despite recent
spring-like weather.
   Buffum checked with local swan experts and finally identified
the problem _ a new fountain installed in the campus reflecting
pool several months ago.
   When Buffum turned off the fountain, the swans revitalized their
romance. The pair already are gathering materials for a nest,
Buffum said.

   Sharon Kopriva has seen her work _ papier mache
representations of mummies _ on display at art galleries across the
country, but never in a morgue.
   That's where one of her creations was taken by police.
   The mummy art apparently was picked up by Houston police when
they helped a landlord enter a residence to find out why water was
leaking into an apartment below.
   They found a leaking aquarium and the mummy-like figure,
according to The Houston Post.
   The owner, who had purchased the piece from Ms. Kopriva in 1986,
had left it there along with other property while moving to a new
residence, Ms. Kopriva said.
   Harris County Medical Examiner's office investigator Cecil Wingo
would say little about the case, other than that it was much ado
about nothing. He said he did not want to embarrass the legitimate
art collector.
   One official said the mummy was taken to the morgue to determine
if it had human parts, and was merely a case where the police who
found the figure didn't know anything about ``bone anatomy.''
   Ms. Kopriva says people often mistake her artwork for real
mummies, ``but not for a very long time.''
   ``It's a very mummy-looking piece,'' the artist said of the
6-foot-tall figure.

<HEAD>Three-Day Probe Uncovers 7,000 Minors Working in Violation of Law</HEAD>

   A surprise nationwide sweep of fast-food
restaurants and other businesses found 7,000 teen-agers employed
for too many hours or in dangerous jobs in violation of child-labor
laws, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said Thursday.
   The three-day investigation, called ``Operation Child Watch,''
is expected to result in more than $1.8 million in civil fines
against businesses, Mrs. Dole said. Fines totaling $2.7 million
were assessed during all of 1989.
   The majority of the allegations involved firms in which 14- and
15-year-olds worked more hours or later at night during the school
week than allowed under federal law, said William Brooks, an
assistant labor secretary.
   But there were also more than 900 youngsters, mostly 16- and
17-year-olds, who were performing dangerous tasks or using
hazardous equipment such as power-driven meat-slicing machinery,
dough mixers and paper-balers.
   Mrs. Dole said labor shortages are tempting firms to violate
child-labor laws in order to find enough workers. That problem will
only worsen in coming years, she said, since the number of workers
between the ages of 16 and 24 is expected to drop by about 2
million, or 8 percent, by the year 2000.
   She said businesses may need to consider offering better fringe
benefits and higher salaries in order to attract workers.
   Federal law forbids 14-year-olds and 15-year-olds from working
more than three hours on a school day or 18 hours during the
five-day school week. Eight hours is permitted on weekend days and
40-hour weeks are permitted in summer and during vacations.
   Those youngsters may not work outside the hours of 7 a.m. to 7
p.m., or 9 p.m. from June 1 to Labor Day.
   Brooks also said nearly 200 youngsters under 14 _ barred from
most jobs, with a few exceptions such as certain farm work and
newspaper routes, were found illegally employed.
   Most of the 7,000 alleged violations were at service businesses,
such as restaurants, grocery stores, pizza and donut shops or dry
cleaning firms, officials said.
   Mrs. Dole declined to name businesses involved, saying
investigations are still going on.
   Brooks said one food store employed more than 20 minors whose
duties included the operation of paper-baling machinery, which he
called ``a particularly dangerous piece of equipment.'' Pizza shops
in two states employed more than 50 youngsters to illegally drive
cars, he said.
   Two 16-year-olds were found illegally employed at a roofing
company, he said. One of the youngsters' fingers were crushed and
nearly severed when a load shifted on the back of a truck; the
other boy had fallen off a roof but did not sustain long-term
injuries, Brooks said.
   The three-day probe, which involved 500 federal investigators
who visited businesses in all 50 states, was intended to send a
signal that the government is strengthening its efforts to protect
children from exploitation in the workplace, Mrs. Dole said at a
news conference.
   ``The cop is on the beat. Violations, whether motivated by greed
or by ignorance, will not be tolerated,'' she said.
   Mrs. Dole said skeptics of the Bush administration's commitment
to child labor enforcement are needlessly worried.
   ``I think the proof is in the pudding, as they say. There will
be additional strike forces,'' she said.
   In a letter to Mrs. Dole this week, Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., called for more money to combat child-labor violations. He
noted that there are fewer than 1,000 federal investigators
assigned to such matters.
   ``With so little oversight, it is little wonder than child-labor
violations are becoming more widespread. ... In the absence of
strong federal action, the future may be even bleaker,'' Schumer
wrote.
   Rep. Don Pease, D-Ohio, said he welcomed Mrs. Dole's ``readiness
to get tough with child labor scofflaws'' but said ``the situation
calls for more than a finger in the dike.''
   Pease and Schumer plan to introduce legislation next month to
expand the definition of child-labor violations. It also may
provide more funding for enforcement and increase the penalties
beyond the current $1,000 maximum, a spokesman said.
   Mrs. Dole said the government should first make the most of
current resources. ``Then if additional funds are needed, you can
bet I'll ask for those funds,'' she said, adding that other
proposed changes are under review.
   Of the 3,400 businesses visited during the three-day probe,
about 1,400 were in apparent violation of child labor practices,
she said.
   Last year, the Labor Department's wage and hour division, which
enforces child-labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act,
found 22,508 minors to be illegally employed, an all-time high.
   Last Thursday, the department sued the Burger King restaurant
chain in U.S. District Court in Miami, alleging child labor law
violations since 1986.

   President Bush today called Mikhail S.
Gorbachev ``a reasonable man'' and said he was not troubled that
Gorbachev has had his powers strengthened by the Soviet Parliament.
   ``They've come out of the totalitarianism of the past. I don't
see it as a threat,'' Bush said.
   He said there was ``much less of a danger today'' from the
Kremlin.
   Bush made his comments at a question-and-answer session with the
board of directors of the National Newspaper Association.
   The president was not asked about a fire that caused extensive
damage at a Libyan plant the United States suspects of making
chemical weapons.
   Referring to Gorbachev, Bush said, ``I think he's a reasonable
man. I'm not worried about the constitutional changes.''
   The Soviet Parliament voted Tuesday to expand Gorbachev's
authority and end the Communist Party's monopoly on political power.
   Bush opened the session by saying the U.S. economy ``remains
sound and steady'' but ``not as robust as I'd like to see it.''
   Responding to questions, Bush noted a wave of recent speculation
suggesting the release soon of some of the American hostages in
Lebanon.
   ``That frankly confused me,'' Bush said, because the U.S.
government is not involved in any negotiations. He said the
speculation had prompted him to wonder whether a private initiative
had been undertaken on behalf of the hostages.
   ``I wish I could tell you there was a serious, immediate effort
that would pay off, but that isn't the case,'' the president said.
   He said he was glad that he had accepted what turned out to be a
hoax telephone call from someone posing as Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   ``I would do it again,'' Bush said.

<TEXT>
   The Communist leader of an
attempt to overthrow President Najib of Afganistan said he has
joined forces with Moslem guerrillas to fight the Soviet-backed
government.
   Gen. Shah Nawaz Tanai, Afghanistan's former defense minister,
said that despite past differences, he and the Moslem guerrillas
share a common goal to overthrow the Najib government.
   As Najib's defense minister, Tanai was credited with
successfully defending Jalalabad, which was attacked by U.S.-backed
rebels when the Soviet Union withdrew its troops last year after a
decade in Afghanistan.
   Tanai, 40, led a March 6 coup attempt in which 200 civilians
died and 500 were injured. No military casualty figures have been
released.
   ``The coup has not failed. It is continuing,'' Tanai told
reporters Wednesday at a guerrilla base in northern Logar province.
   Tanai, wearing his Afghan military uniform, sat in a dimly lit,
heavily guarded bunker dug into a mountainside. He talked for the
first time about the coup attempt and his agreement with Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, the leader of Hezb-i-Islami, or Party of Islam,
guerrilla faction.
   ``For the national interest, there is a strategic cooperation
with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar to remove Najib,'' Tanai said. Hekmatyar
advocates an Islamic state in Afghanistan.
   Tanai said he instructed his soldiers to cooperate with
Hekmatyar.
   He said ``a large number of soldiers'' remain loyal to him and
that he is mobilizing and re-establishing contacts with them. When
asked whether the number was tens, hundreds or thousands, he
replied, ``More than that.''
   ``With the help of the mujahedeen, the struggle against the
regime is continuing,'' Tanai said. ``Najib is a warmonger. He
claims he wants peace and national reconcilation, but he continues
to burn the nation in the flames of war.''
   During the almost 12-year-old civil war, Tanai took a hard line
against the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, and had opposed
Najib's overtures to guerrilla commanders.
   ``We accept the mistakes of the past and our coming here proves
that,'' Tanai said. ``We have sided with the nation and our actions
should make up for these mistakes.''
   Hekmatyar has said he would support anyone who tried to
overthrow Najib, including Tanai. But the six other parties in the
guerrillas' Pakistan-based government-in-exile have sought to
distance themselves from Tanai.
   Some moderate resistance leaders, however, have said the
Tanai-Hekmatyar connection broke a barrier blocking a political
solution to the war, which has claimed 1.5 million lives and
destroyed tens of thousands of villages.
   ``Gulbuddin has removed the stigma, the obstacle of talking to
the (ruling) People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan,'' said a
member of the moderate National Islamic Front of Afghanistan.
``Maybe it's time for the rest of us to start talking to them _ not
Najib _ but to other members of the party.''
   Tanai was brought to a Hezb-i-Islami base about 50 miles from
Kabul in a truck guarded by Hekmatyar's guerrillas. While he
talked, dozens of fighters stood guard around the camp and on the
hills that ring the base.

<HEAD>INS Agents Detain More Aliens on Eastern Flight</HEAD>

   A raid on a jetliner Thursday netted 53 illegal
aliens, including three Romanians, bringing to 98 the number of
undocumented aliens seized from the transcontinental route in two
days, authorities said.
   Those detained when Eastern Airlines Flight 88 made a scheduled
stop in Atlanta also were from Mexico, Guatemala and Nicaragua.
They were interviewed and photographed, and then fingerprinted,
said officials conducting the raids known as ``Operation Red-Eye
Replay.''
   The overnight flight, from Los Angeles to New York is known as
the ``red-eye.'' Its lower fares are attractive to illegal aliens.
   The undocumented aliens purchased their tickets in advance and
apparently did not know of the previous day's arrests, said Neil
Jacobs, the deputy agent in charge of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's Atlanta district.
   The smugglers who booked the flight were paid in advance and
probably didn't care if the aliens were caught, he said.
   ``(The smugglers) are dealing in human beings,'' said Thomas
Fischer, agent in charge of the Atlanta INS office. ``They could
care less about what happens to these people today.''
   Agents checked manifests on Eastern Flight 88 for Friday and the
weekend, but there was no indication of a large number of Latin
Americans booked for those days, Jacobs said.
   Thursday was at least the fourth time an Eastern flight from Los
Angeles was raided by INS agents _ three times during stops in
Atlanta and once in Los Angeles as the aliens were preparing to
board. The earlier two incidents occurred a year ago.
   Fischer said the Romanians on Thursday's flight went from
Bucharest to East Berlin to Havana to Mexico City, where they
worked their way to the U.S. border.
   Agents said it was not clear whether any of them would have a
claim to refugee status that would allow them to remain in the
United States.
   Refugee status generally is not given to those who flee their
homelands only to improve their economic situation.
   Most of those detained Wednesday and Thursday were Mexicans who
will be taken to detention camps in Texas and processed for return
to Mexico. Those from other countries will go to the Krome
Detention Center near Miami for eventual return to their countries.

<HEAD>President Announces Salary Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Felix Houphouet-Boigny's
government announced salary and benefit cuts targeting middle-level
and senior government officials Thursday in a bid to appease
critics and avoid bankruptcy.
   ``These measures have caused us much pain ... We cry with you in
these sad and hard times,'' the president said in a televised
address.``But if we do not take these measures, in four or five
months ... we will not be able to pay salaries.''
   Houphouet-Boigny said farmers already had to accept in October a
``brutal cut'' in government payments for their crops.
   In February demonstrations led by university students,
protesters said the poor bore a heavier burden in the country's
financial crisis. Houphouet-Boigny has blamed the problems on
slumping prices of raw materials.
   Dozens were injured and arrested in the protests, which police
repressed with tear gas and truncheons.
   Finance Minister Moise Koumoue Koffi said workers earning less
than the equivalent of $350 a month would not be affected by the
salary cuts.
   He announced cuts of 8 percent for government workers earning
more than $350, 14 percent for those earning more than $700, and 17
percent for those earning more than $1,754.
   Cabinet ministers and presidents of state-owned companies would
have their salaries and fringe benefits cut by 40 percent, and
legislators by 25 percent, he said.
   Private sector workers would pay a ``solidarity tax'' of 5
percent to 10 percent, except those earning less than $350, Koffi
said.
   The loss of income would be compensated by cuts in the cost of
living, he said, including reductions in state-controlled prices of
staple foods, fuel, electricity and housing.
   He said the government would also collect overdue debts,
``pitilessly combat'' fraud, and cut costs of import and custom
duties. The duties are some of the highest in the world.
   ``The situation of private companies and banks is cause for
grave concern,'' Koffi said. ``We need to work quickly to reassert
confidence or the system of payment will be paralyzed and the
country will be confronted with mass bankruptcy and increased
unemployment.''
   Corruption and extravagance in the government have exacerbated
the country's economic crisis, Western economists and diplomats
say. Protesters demanding the president's downfall accused him of
contributing to the financial crisis by siphoning money from state
coffers.
   ``We were surprised that a problem that was essentially economic
and social has been politicized, casting doubt on those in charge,
suggesting that for 30 years we have done nothing,'' said
Houphouet-Boigny, who has ruled Ivory Coast as a one-party state
since its independence from France in 1960.

<HEAD>She Says She Shaped History, Got Reagan to Warm Up to Gorbachev</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astrologer Joan Quigley said Thursday that the
star-gazing advice she gave Nancy Reagan during Ronald Reagan's
presidency influenced the course of history in big ways and small,
even steering the president away from his ``Evil Empire'' view of
the Soviet Union.
   In a book giving her version of her eight-year relationship with
the Reagans _ first disclosed in 1988 by fired Reagan adviser
Donald Regan _ Ms. Quigley asserted that she set the times some
presidential events would occur down to the minute and sometimes
even to the second.
   When Reagan announced his selection of Anthony Kennedy for a
seat on the Supreme Court on Nov. 11, 1987, she chose 25 seconds
after 11:32 a.m. EST as the moment for the announcement. ``A man
with a stopwatch'' gave Reagan the signal for proceeding, she wrote.
   She said she also delayed the timing of Reagan's first cancer
operation in 1985 by three days and dictated when Mrs. Reagan's
mastectomy would take place.
   Ms. Quigley says Reagan knew of her influence on his wife and
gave her a thank-you kiss when he finally met her.
   Mrs. Reagan, in her memoirs, ``My Turn,'' wrote last year that
while Ms. Quigley was ``helpful and comforting ... a kind of
therapist,'' she had influence solely on Reagan's schedule.
   ``No political decision was ever made based on it,'' she said.
   However, Ms. Quigley said that before Reagan's first summit with
Mikhail Gorbachev, she worked three hours to persuade Mrs. Reagan
that her husband could trust the Soviet leader. She said she
``battled her to the mat'' to get Reagan's view of Gorbachev
changed.
   ``The placement of his ruler, Mercury, in the 10th house of
power and position convinces me that Gorbachev came to power ...
because of his high degree of intelligence,'' she said she told the
first lady. ``It symbolizes to me that despite his Russian training
and origins, he has the instincts of a humanitarian.''
   Finally, the president's wife replied, ``I know you are right,''
she said.
   ``Through Nancy, I had a direct line to the president,'' Ms.
Quigley wrote.
   ``I was responsible for timing all press conferences, most
speeches, the State of the Union addresses, the takeoffs and
landings of Air Force One. I picked the time of Ronald Reagan's
debate with (Jimmy) Carter and the two debates with Walter Mondale;
all extended trips abroad as well as the shorter trips and one-day
excursions, the announcement that Reagan would run for a second
term, briefings for all the summits except Moscow, although I
selected the time to begin the Moscow trip.
   ``I timed congressional arm-twisting, the second inaugural oath
of office, the announcement of Anthony Kennedy's Supreme Court
nomination.''
   Ms. Quigley said her most tedious work was analyzing Reagan's
horoscope ``on an hour by hour basis.''
   Birch Lane Press said Thursday's publication date for Ms.
Quigley's book _ ``What Does Joan Say?'' _ was selected by the
astrologer.
   Vassar-educated and a San Francisco socialite, Ms. Quigley is
the author of three books on astrology. Her form of astrology goes
beyond sun signs and deals with the moon and all eight planets as
well, according to her publisher.
   Ms. Quigley wrote that she did not intend to write a book, even
after Regan disclosed her role when he wrote his memoirs as White
House chief of staff. But she reconsidered, she said, when Mrs.
Reagan's book came out last year.
   ``It reads like fiction and much of it is evasive,'' she wrote
of Mrs. Reagan's account. ``What she has left out would fill a
book.''
   At the time Regan told of Mrs. Reagan's use of an astrologer,
Reagan spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president had emphasized
``that he made no policy decisions based on astrology.''
   Ms. Quigley's account differs.
   She wrote that Reagan asked his wife to ask her about going to
Reykjavik, Iceland, for his second summit with Gorbachev. Reagan
and Secretary of State George P. Shultz ``followed my advice to
negotiate there as long and as hard as possible, and following my
advice they stayed later than planned.''
   ``Ronnie asked Nancy, `What does Joan say?' when he wanted to
know when the Irangate ordeal would be over,'' she wrote. ``And he
phoned to thank me personally for a letter written at the end of
Irangate, in which I described myself as his astrologer, addresing
him as `Dear Ronnie' and signing it `Joan.'''
   Ms. Quigley was discreet about how much she had been paid for
her efforts _ just as Mrs. Reagan was. The astrologer said she
orginally was paid by the hour for time spent on the phone with
Mrs. Reagan and time spent in preparation.
   She said when she raised her fee for other clients she kept Mrs.
Reagan's at the old level. Finally, she charged Mrs. Reagan a fixed
monthly fee ``because she needed much more of my time than she
could afford. This was very generous on my part.''

<HEAD>Rural Development Bill Stalled In House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fight over federal water and sewer money
ended Thursday in the House with a vote that gutted a massive rural
development bill and forced sponsors to stop floor action until
they find a new strategy.
   Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, said many of
the members didn't understand the killer amendment they approved
because of inaccuracies he said were stated during debate.
   ``We can regroup,'' said de la Garza, D-Texas. He said the
legislation's supporters would take some time to speak to their
colleagues before continuing with floor action on the bill.
   After an hour of arguing, the members voted 204-193 on an
amendment by Rep. Charles Rose, D-N.C., that killed a provision
allowing about $500 million to $600 million in existing federal
funds for water and sewer projects to be used for other local needs.
   The amendment also froze about $100 million appropriated for
business and industry development and another $100 million for
community facilities.
   The funds amount to the only significant money in the
legislation which creates very little new spending.
   The idea was to pool the funds so that individual communities
could decide for themselves where to apply federal money.
   ``If the amendment stays, it preserves the status quo,'' said de
la Garza.
   ``Under the present system there has been a tremendous
inequity,'' said Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., who authored the bill
with Rep. Tom Coleman, R-Mo.
   He said that if a state doesn't use all of its share of water
and sewer money, for example, the funds go back to the federal
government and become available to any other states that apply for
it.
   He said the aggressiveness of the local Farmers Home
Administration directors has had a lot to do with how much of the
money a state gets.
   ``There are some FmHA directors who philosophically don't like
these programs so they spend very little of it (the available
money),'' English said after the vote.
   Rose said the bill would give too much power to the agriculture
secretary to decide where funds should be used.
   Under the legislation, state review panels would set priorities
on projects, but the Agriculture Department would have the final
say on use of the money.
   Rose said if his amendment were not adopted, the secretary would
have ``unprecedent, uncontrollable authority to transfer money
without input from Congress.''
   But Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., said ``the bottom line is that if
we adopt the Rose amendment we really don't have much of a bill
here. It makes sense to let the state determine how to use these
limited resources.''
   De la Garza said time has been set aside next week for further
action on the bill but did not say whether sponsors would try again
that soon or take more time to try to persuade members to change
their opinions.
   The bill is designed to help decaying rural communities
diversify away from farming as their main source of income. It is
significantly different from a bill on rural development already
passed by the Senate.

<HEAD>Denktash Resigns to Clear Way for Elections and New Mandate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the breakaway Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus resigned Thursday to clear the way for
early elections that he said will be a referendum on the divided
island's future.
   Presidential elections will be held April 22 and parliamentary
elections May 6.
   Rauf Denktash resigned as president and later told a news
conference that the presidential election would be a vote of
confidence for his policies on Cyprus reunification talks. He said
he would not run as a candidate of a specific party.
   Denktash complained that some Turkish Cypriot politicians had
accused him of being too uncompromising in the Cyprus talks.
   ``In the talks (Cypriot President George) Vassilou keeps showing
me copies of such statements,'' Denktash said. ``I could not carry
such a responsibility in the midst of fluctuations like this. We
must ask the people.''
   In Ankara, the Turkish capital, Mehmet Yazar, state minister and
government spokesman, praised Denktash and said support for him
would continue.
   The latest round of U.N.-sponsored Cyprus talks collapsed
earlier this month over Turkish Cypriot demands for
self-determination on the eastern Mediterranean island.
   Cyprus has been split into northern Turkish and southern Greek
sectors since Turkey's invasion in 1974 after an Athens-engineered
coup. The Turkish Cypriots proclaimed full independence in 1983 but
only Turkey recognizes the state.

<HEAD>Parties Begin Final Campaign Push for Sunday's Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political parties began their final campaign
push Thursday and Communist Premier Hans Modrow's caretaker
government urged East Germans to avoid rushing into reunification
with West Germany.
   The campaign for Sunday's parliamentary elections has been
shaken by the resignation of a top conservative candidate who
admitted he had worked for the now virtually disbanded secret
police.
   As rumors swirled that other candidates may also have worked for
the once all-powerful force, the leftist Social Democrats denied
they had informants in their top ranks.
   Candidates for the 24 slates put forward by various parties were
crisscrossing the country and holding rallies ahead of the nation's
first free elections.
   Meanwhile, an opinion poll released by the government in Bonn
showed that 90 precent of West Germans surveyed favor unification;
the figure was 95 percent for East Germans.
   The poll was taken early this month by the respected Infratest
organization for the West German Ministry for Inner-German
Relations.
   According to the poll, 51 percent of the 1,030 East Germans
questioned said they wanted unification ``soon.'' Of the 1,010 West
Germans asked the same question, the figure was 40 percent,
according to the poll.
   No margin of error for the poll was given.
   An estimated 12.3 million East Germans are eligible to take part
in the balloting for the new 400-member Parliament.
   Wolfgang Schnur, leader of the Democratic Awakening party, had
been one of the top candidates for Sunday's voting. But he quit
Wednesday after admitting he had worked for the secret police.
   A citizens group investigating Schnur's case has secured file
folders containing information he gave to officials, the state news
agency ADN said Thursday.
   Schnur was expelled from the conservative party he headed and
helped found. Party leaders named Rainer Eppelmann, an East Berlin
pastor and Cabinet minister in Modrow's caretaker government, as
acting successor.
   Eppelmann, 47, faces the challenge of keeping together the
conservative Alliance for Germany, a coalition of three parties
that Schnur helped build for Sunday's elections. The alliance has
received enormous support from West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   The Social Democrats, another leading contender in the
elections, denied rumors that one-time informers were in its top
ranks as well.
   Party leaders, at a news conference in East Berlin, displayed
documents they claimed proved there were no ties to the hated
secret police.
   In East Berlin, the caretaker Cabinet held its last meeting
before the elections.
   ``Overall, the government has been able to lead the German
Democratic Republic onto the way out of its crisis,'' government
spokesman Wolfgang Meyer told a news conference later. ``To some
extent, people have become aware of avoiding a head-over-heels rush
to unification.''
   Modrow's government, which took office in November after the
ouster of hard-line Communist Erich Honecker, also includes eight
ministers from various pro-democracy organizations.
   Together they have been asking East Germans to slow the pace of
reunification, arguing that there are still positive elements of
the socialist system.
   Meyer said there was a ``light upward trend'' in the nation's
economy, which weeks ago had reportedly been on the brink of
collapse.
   East Germany has been shaken by the exodus of nearly 500,000
people, many of them young, skilled workers, since last year.
   West German officials are making plans to try to halt the influx
by shutting down reception centers for the East Germans after the
elections.
   The Bonn government says a democratic government in East Berlin
and eventual unification should make such emigration unnecessary.
But it also has acknowledged reunification could take several years
to complete.

<TEXT>
   The attorney who helped bring down former House
Speaker Jim Wright is involved in a heated battle of his own _ the
race for president of the Cook County Board.
   Heading into Tuesday's primary, newspaper polls put Democrat
Richard J. Phelan at even or slightly ahead of one of his three
opponents, but well ahead of the Democrats' slated candidate.
   The son of a Chicago precinct captain, Phelan has been a
behind-the-scenes player in local Democratic politics for years,
serving as a fund-raiser in U.S. Sen. Paul Simon's 1984 campaign.
   Twice in the last year, however, Phelan has taken a public role.
As in the Wright case, he has made ethics the battleground as he
seeks the county board presidency, a post the party has long used
to control thousands of patronage jobs.
   Wright, who resigned from Congress last year in the face of
Phelan's investigation, ``wasn't part of my party'' because of the
Texas Democrat's actions in skirting a congressional limit on
speaking fees, Phelan said.
   Portrayed as an impartial outsider when retained by the House
Ethics Committee, Phelan is using the same tack against the Cook
County Democratic organization.
   ``When I say I'm an outsider I mean I'm outside the machine
politics,'' Phelan said in a telephone interview.
   People supporting his campaign want ``to see an end to politics
as usual'' in the president's office, run by the party, he said.
   When Cook County Board President George W. Dunne announced he
would retire after 21 years, it set off a four-way race whose pitch
has sharpened as each candidate has tried to stake the other to the
ethical low ground.
   The other candidates are:
   _ R. Eugene Pincham, 64, a former Illinois Appellate Court
justice trying to become the first black to hold the county
president post. Recent polls by Chicago's two largest daily papers
show Pincham and Phelan as leaders of the pack.
   _ Cook County Clerk Stanley T. Kusper, 55, a veteran of Chicago
politics who was hand-picked for his current post by the late Mayor
Richard J. Daley in 1973.
   _ State Sen. Ted Lechowicz, 51, like Kusper a bastion of machine
politics, and the party's slated candidate. Trailing his rivals in
polls by the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times, Lechowicz
is counting on loyal precinct captains to get out the vote.
   Dunne has not been a factor in the race and Chicago Mayor
Richard M. Daley has refused to publicly back a candidate.
   A wide-open race for the post is another obituary for the
machine the elder Daley controlled, said political analyst Paul
Green, director of the Institute of Public Affairs at Governor's
State University in south surburban University Park.
   The Democratic party no longer has a consolidated hold on power
so the race is a battle, ``because there's no organization to
prevent the fight from taking place,'' Green said. ``Ambition is no
longer limited by party approval.''
   Phelan, 52, worried party leaders last summer when he considered
entering the primary for governor. He backed off, but jumped into
the board president's race after Dunne's announcement.
   A partner in one of the city's fastest-growing law firms, he has
given or lent more to his campaign _ close to $900,000 _ than any
of the other candidates have raised, according to campaign finance
records.
   A $1 million television campaign has put his face before TV
viewers an average of three times a week.

<HEAD>March Storm Buffets The Upper Midwest With Snow, High Wind</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   More record high temperatures were reported Thursday across much
of the East, and low pressure crossing the upper Mississippi Valley
produced high wind from the northern and central Plains to the Ohio
Valley and the Great Lakes.
   The storm also produced unexpected snow across parts of Iowa and
Minnesota.
   Wind in western South Dakota reached 75 mph at Rapid City during
the morning, with gusts to 100 mph.
   Gillette, Wyo., reported wind gusts as high as 60 mph.
   Other high wind gusts included: 67 mph at La Crosse, Wis.; 65 to
70 mph at Macomb, Ill.; 64 mph at Dubuque, Iowa; 60 mph at
Janesville, Wis.; 58 mph at Ottumwa, Iowa; 55 mph at Moline, Ill.,
and Green Bay, Wis.; 54 mph at Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and 52 mph at
Chicago's Midway Airport.
   Snow accompanied the high wind in some areas of the northern
Plains region and the upper Mississippi Valley. Five inches of snow
fell at Omaha, Neb., during the night, and as much as 9 inches fell
at Worthington in southwestern Minnesota. Western Iowa also got
heavy, wet snow.
   A winter storm warning was issued for eastern and north-central
North Dakota, where wind blowing at 30 to 40 mph and 4 to 8 inches
of snow was expected to produce near-blizzard conditions.
   Snow and gusty winds also lingered in the northern mountains of
Colorado, with up to 6 inches of snow possible by Friday morning.
   Rain associated with a cold front crossing the Mississippi
Valley extended from the central Gulf Coast to Indiana and Illinois
during the afternoon, with showers and thunderstorms over the
central Gulf Coast states.
   Biloxi, Miss., got 4.3 inches of rain between 6 a.m. and noon

   The Soviet Congress on Thursday gave Mikhail S.
Gorbachev his first presidential mission: deal personally with the
defiant leaders in Lithuania who have declared the Baltic republic
independent.
   Hours after watching Gorbachev take the presidential oath, the
Congress of People's Deputies passed a resolution charging him with
``assuring the defense of the legal rights of every person living
on Lithuanian territory,'' as well as defending Soviet interests
there.
   Gorbachev himself, saying independence-minded republics were
``on the edge of a process that must be stopped,'' prompted the
Congress to pass the measure after editing out sections that cast
more blame on the Lithuanians.
   Lithuania, a republic of 3.7 million residents, declared itself
independent from the Soviet Union on Sunday. Gorbachev said this
week that the move was ``illegal and invalid,'' and the Congress'
resolution Thursday echoed his rejection and pronounced the Soviet
Constitution still valid there.
   Gorbachev told a press conference after the session ended
Thursday night that he expected to hold ``a dialogue, a respectful
dialogue, with the people of Lithuania'' and their government. He
emphasized he would not consider the talks actual diplomatic
``negotiations'' between separate countries.
   Lithuanian deputies had largely backed Gorbachev's candidacy
because they expected him to be a reasonable partner in such talks.
But they did not participate in the vote.
   The Congress passed the Lithuania resolution with a 1,463-94
vote after almost three hours of often polemical speeches.
Condemnation of the rebellious republic far outweighed support.
Nearly 700 deputies did not vote, although many of those had left
the late-evening session.
   Adm. Vitaly Ivanov, commander of the Soviet Baltic Fleet,
accused Lithuanian leaders of ``betrayal of their own people and
the people of the Soviet Union,'' and called the declaration of
independence ``a stab in the back'' of the country.
   Yevgeny Kogan, a proponent for non-Estonians' rights in the
Baltic republic of Estonia, called for Gorbachev to immediately
impose direct presidential rule in the three Baltic republics,
which include Latvia, to stop what he called a ``campaign of
psychological terror'' against Russians and other minorities.
   His proposal was met with some applause from the hall, but
Gorbachev ignored the suggestion.
   Most of the Lithuanian deputies who could have defended the
republic's move were absent, either busy with a legislature session
at home or unwilling to serve in the parliament of what they now
consider a foreign country.
   The one Lithuanian who took the floor, Nikolai Medvedev, was met
with scattered cries of ``Enemy of the People!'' when he spoke. The
epithet was widespread during the witch-hunting days of dictator
Josef Stalin.
   Medvedev accused Bolshevism of causing hundreds of thousands of
deaths in Lithuania in Stalin's repressions and mass deportations.
He warned that the original, more harshly worded draft of the
resolution would only make the situation in the republic worse.
   Rafik Nishanov, chairman of one of the chambers of the Soviet
legislature, said hundreds of telegrams had been pouring into the
Congress with complaints about the hasty decision by the Lithuanian
parliament.
   Army Lt. Col. Nikolai Petrushenko complained that wholesale
draft-dodging had begun in Lithuania, and warned that Soviet troops
might be sent to round up the recalcitrant conscripts ``in their
farms and villages.''
   According to reports from Lithuania, thousands of youths have
handed in their draft cards and will refuse this spring's call-up.
The Lithuanian parliament this week passed a measure removing
penalties for draft-dodgers.
   For all their objections to Lithuania's declaration, none of the
speakers proposed using force to solve the dilemma.

Destroyed</HEAD>

   John Poindexter told the FBI three days after
resigning his White House post that he had ``no working knowledge''
of early Iran arms shipments and ``no direct knowledge'' profits
had been diverted to the Nicaraguan Contras, an FBI agent testified
at his trial Thursday.
   Agent Ellen Glasser also testified that more than 5,000 files
were erased from Poindexter's computer system just before the
national security adviser resigned as the Iran-Contra affair was
coming to light.
   Six months after the Nov. 28, 1986, FBI interview at his home,
Poindexter told Congress _ in testimony that cannot be used at his
trial _ that he approved the diversion to the Contras at North's
request and had been involved in a November 1985 shipment of Hawk
missiles to Iran.
   Glasser, in her testimony, spoke of a ``massive destruction'' of
computer messages and provided details of the heretofore
undisclosed Poindexter interview that she and another FBI agent
conducted.
   She said that during that interview Poindexter was asked whether
he knew of any destruction of documents pertinent to the
investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.
   He ``replied that he did not,'' the agent recalled.
   Concerning the diversion to the Contras, Glasser testified that
Poindexter said he knew ``Ollie North ... was up to something.''
   She said she showed Poindexter copies of chronologies on the
Iran initiative. The final version compiled by Robert McFarlane,
Poindexter's predecessor as then-President Reagan's national
security adviser, and aide Oliver North concealed the U.S. role in
the missile shipment.
   Asked whether the documents were accurate, Poindexter ``replied
that they were,'' Glasser said. North was convicted last year of
aiding and abetting an obstruction of Congress in connection with
the chronologies.
   Poindexter is accused of concealing from Congress the U.S. role
in the missile shipment as well as the North-directed military
assistance to the Contras at a time official U.S. aid was banned.
   Part of the indictment accuses him of purging his computer files
between Nov. 22 and Nov. 29, 1986, in an attempt to conceal
information from Congress.
   On Nov. 22, there were over 5,000 computer messages in
Poindexter's terminal, but at 9 a.m. on Nov. 24 ``there were
zero,'' Glasser testified.
   ``This massive deletion ... occurred in November 1986,'' she
said under cross-examination by Poindexter lawyer Richard Beckler,
who suggested the files could have been deleted at some other time.
   Poindexter was logged onto the computer system for a 15-hour
span Nov. 24, starting at 4:30 a.m., testified Kelly Williams, who
was in charge of the computer software section at the White House
Communications Agency. That was the day before Poindexter resigned.
   Williams said Poindexter's identification code was the one used
to gain access to the computer when the files were deleted.
   Prosecutor Louise Radin asked if deleting the files would be
comparable to ``taking a manila envelope and just throwing it
away?''
   ``Yes, that would be the effect,'' Williams replied.
   A total of 732 notes were deleted from North's own computer
files about the same time Poindexter's system was cleared out,
Williams said. Only one of North's computer files remained.
   Copies of Poindexter's and North's files were recovered from
backup tapes at the NSC's computer system and have been
instrumental in tracing the Iran-Contra affair.
   Earlier in the day, prosecutor Dan Webb said he could complete
his case against Poindexter as early as Monday because North's four
days of testimony ``cut off two or three weeks'' from the
prosecution's work.
   Webb said North's testimony, which ended Wednesday, went well
and that the government got ``a lot'' out of the former White House
aide.
   North testified that Poindexter told him he could ``take care
of'' an upcoming meeting with members of Congress. North lied at
the meeting by denying he was assisting the Nicaraguan rebels.
   North also testified that he saw Poindexter tear up a
politically embarrassing presidential document. The document,
called a finding, retroactively authorized the shipment of missiles
to Iran.

<HEAD>Body Processes, Not Contamination, May Cause L-Tryptophan-Linked
Illness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Natural chemical processes in the body _ not
contamination _ may be behind hundreds of cases of a rare, painful
blood disorder in people who took the health-food supplement
L-tryptophan, researchers say.
   The substance, sold as a natural relaxation aid, has been
recalled voluntarily by several makers at the urging of the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration, which suspected contamination.
   Fourteen people who took L-tryptophan have died in recent months
and more than 1,200 others have fallen ill with
eosinophilia-myalgia, a rare blood disroder which in milder cases
causes aches, rashes and fever.
   The new study was conducted at Georgetown University in
Washington, D.C., and reported in Friday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   ``Arguing against the contamination theory is that in spite of
the fact that people have been searching (for the contaminant), it
hasn't been identified,'' said one of the researchers, Dr. Paul
Katz, chief rheumatologist at Georgetown.
   ``Also, the L-tryptophan implicated has been traced to three
different manufacturers,'' Katz said in a telephone interview
Thursday. ``That argues a little bit against there being a
common-source contaminant.''
   Chris Lecos, an FDA spokesman, said the research didn't change
the agency's advice against taking L-tryptophan.
   ``It doesn't serve the public to come forth with speculation.
What we're looking for is a clear-cut explanation,'' Lacos said.
   But he acknowledged in a telephone interview from Washington on
Thursday, ``We've analyzed hundreds of samples (of L-tryptophan),
including from victims themselves, and have failed to identify a
specific chemical or microbial contaminant responsible for the
outbreak.''
   Lecos added, ``This is not a disease that should be taken
lightly by anyone. People should stop taking this stuff.''
   Katz and his colleagues at Georgetown believe L-tryptophan
supplements under certain conditions may contribute to a build-up
of a naturally occurring substance in the body called serotonin.
   Serotonin is a byproduct of the breakdown of L-tryptophan, which
is an amino acid, or protein component, that occurs naturally in
many foods but is usually present in greater concentrations in the
dietary supplement.
   Some researchers believe abnormal levels of serotonin may
contribute to syndromes similar to eosinophilia-myalgia, Katz said.
   L-tryptophan supplements have been sold over the counter for
years to combat sleeplessness, depression, premenstrual syndrome,
stress and other problems.
   Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome _ which is caused by an excess of
a certain type of white blood cell _ have been noted in people
taking L-tryptophan supplements only in the last year or so.
   The disorder may have occurred earlier and been diagnosed as
different but similar syndromes, Katz said.
   The researchers found seven patients at Georgetown who developed
the rare blood disorder while taking L-tryptophan.
   All patients had the muscle pain and tenderness characteristic
of the syndrome, and rashes, fever and breathing difficulty were
common, the researchers said.
   Three of the patients had taken antidepressant medication, which
inhibits the absorption of serotonin by nerve cells in the brain.
Their use in conjunction with L-tryptophan probably resulted in an
excess that the body was unable to chemically process, the authors
suggest.
   In the other four cases, the patients' bodies for some reason
may have been unable to metabolize L-tryptophan, Katz said.
   By mid-February, the national Centers for Disease Control had
recorded 14 deaths and 1,269 cases of illness nationwide from
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with ingestion of
L-tryptophan supplements.
   The Food and Drug Administration on Nov. 17 requested a
voluntary recall of L-tryptophan supplements and five days later
extended that to include a ban on imports.
   Dr. Richard M. Silver, associate professor of medicine and
pediatrics at the Medical University of South Carolina, who has
studied L-tryptophan, said the Georgetown researchers ``may be on
target.''

   President Bush called Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``a
reasonable man'' Thursday and said he was not worried that the
Soviet president would turn into a dictator as a result of new
powers granted by his Parliament.
   ``They've come out of the totalitarianism of the past,'' Bush
said, crediting Gorbachev with being a major force promoting
peaceful changes in Eastern Europe.
   ``And I've consulted with him, had communications from him, for
example, on the question of Germany,'' Bush said. ``And I think
he's a reasonable man.''
   The Soviet Parliament on Tuesday endorsed Gorbachev's proposal
for a strong presidency and ended the Communist Party's long
monopoly on political power. Before the final vote, Gorbachev
granted several concessions that seemed to ease critics' fears that
the new president might usher in a new era of Soviet dictatorship.
   Bush made his comments in a question and answer session with
out-of-town news executives of the National Newspaper Association.
   The president used the occasion to express irritation with U.S.
volunteers in Nicaragua who, he said, were intent on keeping the
leftist Sandinista government in power.
   Without identifying anyone by name, Bush said, ``I am frustrated
a little bit by some of the Americans that have gone down to
Nicaragua, been there for two years allegedly to help the people of
Nicaragua, and then Nicaragua has a free and fair election, and it
turns out these people were interested in helping the Sandinistas,
the Sandinismos.
   ``And now they're picketing ... in front of the U.S. Embassy
because in their view the wrong people won the election.''
   In a major upset, the U.S.-backed opposition candidate, Violeta
Chamorro, defeated President Daniel Ortega in presidential
elections Feb. 25.
   Dennis Marker, director of a church-based group known as Witness
for Peace, said Bush apparently was talking about his organization,
which is dedicated to changing U.S. policy in Central America.
   ``We have had U.S. citizens demonstrating in front of the
embassy since 1983,'' Marker said. ``The reason people are
demonstrating is not because of who won the election. We are
demonstrating against continued U.S. interference in Nicaragua.''
   With the election of Mrs. Chamorro, Marker said, ``The
president's trying to say Nicaragua should be closed to views that
are different from his own.''
   On other subjects at his second news conference in three days,
Bush said he:
   _Wishes the deficit were lower so that more funds would be
available to help the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe and
Latin America.
   _Opposes suggestions that U.S. aid be cut to Israel and Egypt to
make money available for those democracies. ``I don't want to
suggest cutting to good friends,'' Bush said, adding that he would
like greater flexibility to disburse foreign aid.
   _Rejects the notion that America is in decline, saying, ``We
still have the highest standard of living in the world. ... So I am
not that pessimistic, and yet I don't want to stand here with some
Pollyannnish attitude about the economy. There are some signs that
worry me.''
   _Is ``frankly confused'' by last week's speculation that an
American hostage in Lebanon might be released because there are no
negotiations going on involving the U.S. government. ``I wish I
could tell you that there was a serious, immediate effort that
would pay off, but that isn't the case.''
   _Is ``very pleased with the way the Lithuanian situation is
developing'' in the wake of its declaration of independence from
the Soviet Union. ``We will encourage the fundamental principles of
self-determination, and we will encourage the concept of peaceful
change.''

   The White House said Thursday that a Libyan
plant suspected of making chemical weapons had been knocked out of
commission by a serious fire. ``We don't have any idea who did
it,'' President Bush's spokesman said.
   From Bush on down, the administration denied any involvement in
Wednesday's blaze, which occurred one week after the White House
said the plant posed a serious danger and called for ``vigorous
efforts'' to stop its operation.
   ``We don't know the origins of the fire,'' said White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``We don't know if it was
sabotage. We don't have any idea who did it. ... Somebody could
have knocked over a kerosene lamp or something.''
   The plant, located at Rabta, about 60 miles southwest of
Tripoli, was heavily guarded by surface-to-air missile batteries,
tanks and soldiers.
   It has been a point of aggravation in the deep diplomatic split
between Washington and Tripoli. CIA Director William Webster once
described it as the world's largest chemical weapons factory.
   There was some uncertainty during the day about the extent of
damage to the plant. But in the early evening, a senior U.S.
official said the United States had used its ``intelligence
resources'' to be able to conclude that the plant was inoperable.
   U.S. ``intelligence resources'' are known to include satellites
capable of high-resolution photography.
   Asked if the United States was pleased the plant had burned,
Fitzwater said, ``We aren't going to express an opinion one way or
another. For one thing, we don't know what the results are. We
don't know what's happened there.''
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said CIA Director
William Webster, in testimony to Congress a year ago, had reported
that ``one serious toxic chemical spill had already taken place (at
Rabta) and that such problems were likely to continue.''
   Ms. Tutwiler added, ``We have had various other reports of
accidents at the plant before the current fire.''
   She said the plant appears to be out of operation now. ``However
we remain concerned about Libya's chemical weapons plans and
capabilities.''
   She quoted the Libyan news agency JANA as reporting that at
least two people had been killed. ``We cannot confirm the extent of
casualties,'' she said.
   Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, asserted anew Thursday
that the plant merely produced pharmaceuticals.
   However, Gadhafi said Libya would be willing to pay millions of
dollars to any company that would build it a chemical weapons
facility.
   Bush was asked at a pre-St. Patrick's Day party thrown by House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley what information he had on the fire.
   ``Not much,'' Bush said.
   Asked by a reporter if the United States had been involved, Bush
said, ``No, but we've already said that.''
   Without revealing the source of his information, Fitzwater said
damage at the sprawling plant was extensive but that it was still
standing.
   ``Common sense would tell you it's not functioning,'' he said.
``We assume it's not functioning.''
   On the other hand, he said, ``We don't have the kind of
definitive information that would define the damage. ... The
building is there but is it all burned out inside? We don't really
know.''
   Fitzwater's comments were made before the use of ``intelligence
resources' referred to by the senior official became known.
   Ms. Tutwiler reiterated the longstanding U.S. accusation that
Libya promotes terrorism and is harboring Abu Nidal, a suspect in
several terrorist incidents.
   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., told reporters at the White
House, ``It's the first fire I've heard about in a long time that
I'm pleased with. I only hope it all burned down.'' He commented
after meeting with Bush about South Africa.

<HEAD>Little Rock Case Prompts Infant Formula Warning</HEAD>

   Babies should not be given soy-based beverages
other than infant formulas as their only source of nutrition, the
Food and Drug Administration warned on Thursday.
   The FDA said the soy-based drinks, sometimes called ``soy
milk,'' do not have the nutrients needed for infants.
   A 5-month-old baby girl, whose parents bought the product in a
health food store, was in critical condition at Arkansas Children's
Hospital in Little Rock because of malnourishment, the agency said
in a statement.
   It did not identify the girl or her parents.
   The parents, according to the statement, erroneously believed
that a soy beverage sold in a health food store could be used as
infant formula, and had fed it to their daughter almost since birth.
   Soy beverages analyzed by the Little Rock hospital were found to
be lacking in calcium, niacin and vitamins D, E and C, the agency
said.
   The FDA said children and adults can drink the soy beverages as
long as they are part of an otherwise balanced diet.
   There are soy-based infant formulas that are ``complete and
appropriate,'' and these formulas are not involved in Thursday's
warning, the agency said.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, granted a new, more powerful
presidency on Thursday, said his immediate tasks were to prevent
the Soviet Union from breaking up and to promote free-market
reforms.
   In assuming powers as the Soviet Union's first Western-style
president, Gorbachev warned in a speech at the Congress of People's
Deputies that the reforms required to right his country's woeful
economy would be painful.
   Mindful of his nation's history of dictatorship and terror,
Gorbachev promised legislators he would nurture the Soviet Union's
``young and not fully developed democracy.''
   Gorbachev, who ran into surprisingly strong opposition in the
Soviet Congress before assuming the new presidency, will now have
wide powers to propose legislation, negotiate treaties, veto bills,
appoint the Council of Ministers and void its decisions.
   Significantly, he also has the power to declare war if the
country is attacked and under certain conditions impose direct
presidential rule. This means he could overrule a local government.
   He has shifted his formidable powers further from the Communist
Party leadership to the government. On Wednesday, the Congress
struck the party's constitutional monopoly on power to permit
development of a multiparty system.
   Gorbachev mentioned specifically the need to overcome the
irresponsibility that was a byproduct of collective leadership,
saying, ``An increase of responsibility is the main thing on which
we rely.''
   He said in his speech at Congress, ``Our country is living
through difficult times. But if we act together we will overcome
the difficulties. We must shake off fears and dejection, gain a
confidence in our strength and possibilities, which are truly
great. The Russian people and all peoples united with it in a great
multinational state will succeed in reviving their common homeland,
and will surely achieve that on the roads of perestroika and
socialist renewal.''
   He added, ``I see my role and task as the president of the
U.S.S.R. in affirming national harmony in the country and a spirit
of mutual respect, consolidating the principles of civil peace and
harmony, protecting the interests of the people.''
   Voting results announced Thursday at the Congress indicated a
significant drop in support for the Soviet leader since he was
chosen chairman of the Soviet legislature in May. That position was
essentially a weak presidency.
   Congress elected Gorbachev to a five-year term by a vote of
1,329-495. He was the only candidate. His total was 800 votes less
than what he received one year ago, and not much more than the
1,123 needed to win.
   In a separate ballot, the Congress chose Gorbachev's former vice
president, Anatoly I. Lukyanov, as chairman. The Congress chairman
holds many of the responsibilities of vice president, including the
right of succession if the president cannot continue in office.
   Yegor K. Ligachev, characterized by reformers as a conservative
power on the Communist Party Politburo, praised Gorbachev's
election as ``a truly positive development, especially at a time of
party and social renewal, when both the party and society are
undergoing transformation.''
   One reform-minded deputy, Igor Shamshev, said Gorbachev had lost
the support of extreme conservatives and radical reformers, but
held the moderates.
   On Wednesday, several deputies called for Gorbachev's defeat.
   Teimuraz Avaliani of the western Siberian mining town of
Kemerovo accused him of leading the country to the brink of
collapse, and said, ``I ask you not to vote for Gorbachev under any
circumstances.''
   Yevgeny Kogan, a representatives of Russians living in the
Baltic republic of Estonia, accused Gorbachev of being soft on
separatists. Estonia is pressing for independence.
   ``What would you do if a state decided it was leaving, and the
president didn't take any measures to stop it?'' he asked reporters.
   Despite the opposition, Gorbachev received a standing ovation in
the Congress after results were announced. He stood with his hands
folded before him at the dais inside the Kremlin Palace of
Congresses. He then moved to a wooden table, and with his hand on a
red-bound copy of the Soviet Constitution, took the first
presidential oath of ffice.
   On Wednesday, Gorbachev won a key procedural vote in which the
Congress agreed to elect the president in emergency session rather
than turning it over to a nationwide campaign. In the future, the
Soviet public should be able to elect the president.
   President Bush called Gorbachev ``a reasonable man'' and said he
was not troubled that Gorbachev has had his powers strengthened.
``They've come out of the totalitarianism of the past. I don't see
it as a threat,'' Bush said in Washington.
   Gorbachev closed the day by giving a news conference, his first
in the Kremlin. Spokesmen said he would meet with the press more
frequently as president.
   Some deputies from Lithuania, Estonia and other republics
boycotted the Congress proceedings because they consider their
republics independent rather than part of the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev said he would work to keep the Soviet Union from
breaking apart and would be the president for all of the more than
100 nationalities living in the country.
   ``The president must feel and act not as a representative of a
certain layer of society or political leaning, but as a person
trusted by the entire nation,'' he said.
   ``As president now, I reaffirm my adherence to the territorial
integrity of this country,'' he added. Gorbachev said he intended
to work to conclude a new agreement binding the Soviet republics
together in federation.
   Soviet law should allow for republics to seceed if they wish,
Gorbachev said, but he did not specify under what conditions.
   He promised more radical economic reform, and said some of the
steps would hurt.
   ``The necessity for a more radical perestroika policy is
obvious, and it is for these purposes above all that I am going to
use my powers as president,'' he said.
   New reforms ``may, in the initial stages, be accompanied by
painful phenomena and affect some people's interests,'' he said.
   Promising to to cut the Soviet budget drastically and attack
inflation he otherwise offered few details except to say, `We
urgently need to pass laws aimed at de-monopolizing the economy.''
   Gorbachev said he would work to create a ``viable market''
economy, governed not by bureaucrats but by taxation, bank control
of balance of payments and adjustable interest rates.
   Only months ago, Gorbachev believed that the Soviet Union did
not need a presidential form of government, his close Politburo
adviser Alexander N. Yakovlev told a Soviet newspaper this week.
   In December, he fought a drive in the Congress to strip the
party of its constitutional right to rule. Two months later,
however, Gorbachev persuaded the party to drop its monopoly on
power.
   He told reporters he changed his positions because his reform
program is changing the Soviet Union so quickly.
   ``What was right a year or several months ago, in these
conditions is insufficient,'' he said.

   Official newspapers Thursday said
the president and prime minister had offered to resign, and the
Communist Party of this Kremlin satellite agreed to give up its
nearly 70-year-old monopoly on power.
   ``This is the beginning of real change,'' Foreign Minstry
spokesman Tepbishiin Chimeddorj said of his country, which
strategically borders both the Soviet Union and China.
   The changes, including a call for a contested elections this
year, came at a three-day meeting of the party's decision-making
Central Committee.
   The actions met nearly all the demands of opposition parties
that have led thousands of people through the capital's streets in
demonstrations against the government.
   President Jambyn Batmonh, 64, and Prime Minister Dumaagiyn
Sodnom, 56, had already stepped down this week as members of the
party's Politburo, and Batmonh quit as party leader.
   Official newspapers said they have offered to quit their
government posts when the national legislature holds its annual
session next week.
   In another dramatic repudiation of its past, the Central
Committee voted to expel former party leader Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal
from the party. Tsedenbal, 73, presided over purges in the party
during his 31 years in power that ended in 1984. He now lives in
Moscow.
   The Central Committee Thursday appointed former trade union
leader Gombogavin Ochirbat as the party's new general secretary and
named the party's youngest, most reform-minded Politburo in
decades. The five-member Politburo includes Foreign Minister Ts.
Gombosuren and L. Tudev, the director of the leading official
newspaper, Unen.
   Mongolian sources said the five met privately today to set the
party's course in the face of the challenge from increasingly vocal
urban intellectuals demanding democracy. The intellecturals already
have formed three oppositon parties to contest elections.
   Unen reported today that the 174-member Central Committee ``took
note'' of Batmonh's and Sodnom's offer to resign from their
government jobs.
   ``I support some proposals for my resignation as prime minister
and am willing to discuss another candidate from our party to
replace me. This question should be resolved at the Great People's
Hural,'' the legislature, Unen quoted Sodnom as saying in a speech
Wednesday.
   He made no apologies for his performance during six years as
prime minister.
   Batmonh has been president since 1984, when he also became party
general secretary.
   Sodnom told the Central Committee that Mongolia's debt to the
Soviet Union has more than quadrupled since 1975. The heavy
indebtedness to the Soviet Union, which backed Mongolia's 1921
Communist revolution and stations soldiers here, is a major cause
of dissatisfaction with the ruling party.
   Anti-Soviet nationalism has been a major theme of pro-democracy
protests that began in January and precipitated the ruling party
shake-up. The Soviet Union pledged this month to withdraw all of
its estimated 60,000 soldiers by 1992.
   Unen said 13 elderly Central Committee members, all of whom have
retired in the past few years from state or party posts, also
resigned their Central Committee membership.
   Mongolian sources described the 13 as conservatives who worked
closely with Tsedenbal.
   The Central Committee expelled him from the party but did not
strip him of his state honors.
   It rehabilitated four party officials who were purged in the
early 1960s for criticizing Tsedenbal. The four were sent to the
countryside as punishment for nearly two decades and allowed to
return only when Tsedenbal was ousted.

   Thousands of people gathered Thursday
to commemorate the 1848 democratic revolution against Austrian
rule, and some politicians used the occasion to campaign for
Hungary's first free elections in 40 years.
   The anniversary has in recent years become a symbol of
resistance against Communist rule.
   But the Communists will not have a monopoly on power following
the parliamentary elections March 25, and the 15,000 who turned out
for the anniversary in Budapest was a much smaller number than in
past years. Communist supporters were down to a trickle.
   The Hungarian Socialist Party, the majority faction of the
former Communist Party that disbanded in October 1989, is expected
to do poorly in the elections.
   Last year, more than 100,000 demonstrators surged through the
streets of the capital on the anniversary of the revolution against
Austrian rule, the first truly legal opposition rally on that date.
   Participants called for democracy and the withdrawal of the
Soviet occupation troops.
   These demands have since been fulfilled to a considerable
extent, with the coming elections and a Red Army withdrawal that
began March 12.
   Only about 2,500 people converged on the National Museum to
listen to a speech by Imre Pozsgay, the top reformer in the
Socialist Party. After the low-key rally he repeated his party's
pledge that it is ``prepared to honor all consequences of the
elections.''
   He predicted his party ``will be among the top four parties and
it will be a decisive force in parliament.''
   A Gallup poll published Monday gave the Hungarian Democratic
Forum, one of the most influential opposition groups, 21 percent of
the popular vote. The Free Democrats had 20.3 percent, the
Smallholders Party 15.7 percent and the Socialist Party 8 percent.
   Newspapers publishing the poll did not give details on how many
people were questioned or what they were asked. The reports also
did not provide a margin of error.
   Pozsgay has suffered a serious setback in popularity polls
because a close associate, former Interior Minister Istvan Horvath,
was implicated in a scandal involving illegal police surveillance
and because of controversial decisions made by a media panel he
instituted.
   About 15,000 supporters of the Free Democrats and other
opposition parties rallied around the monument to poet Sandor
Petoefi, a leader of the 1848 revolution, which was suppressed more
than a year later with Russian help.
   Imre Olah of the Entrepreneurs Party, reciting Petoefi, said:
``We swear to God that we will never again be prisoners.''
   ``We swear there will never again be a dictatorship by any
party,'' Olah added.
   The most popular speaker appeared to be Viktor Orban, the
dynamic leader of the League of Young Democrats, who said,
``Hungary has still not gained the stage of full independence.''
   ``We won't have democracy as long as ministers of state, party
leaders and other top officials violate the constitution without
punishment,'' Orban said. He apparently was referring to the
scandal involving Horvath.
   Orban also ridiculed Foreign Minister Gyula Horn, like most
other government leaders a member of the Socialist Party, for a
recent suggestion that Hungary might become a member of NATO. The
idea later was politely dismissed by defense and other officials.
   ``Two years ago he did not even suggest a pullout of the Soviet
troops from Hungary, and now he is acting as an Atlantic hawk,''
Orban said, drawing laughter from the crowd.

   The Soviet Union on Thursday condemned the
settlement of Soviet Jewish immigrants in the Israeli-occupied
territories but said it will not restrict the flow of Jews to
Israel.
   Israel rejected the criticism by the Soviet Union and Arab
states and said their real objective is to halt all Jewish
immigration because it fortifies the Jewish state.
   The heated debate came in the 15-member Security Council as it
took up a Soviet complaint against Israel's settlement of a small
number of Soviet Jews in the occupied lands and its reported plans
to locate tens of thousands more immigrants in the territories,
claimed by Palestinians as a future homeland.
   The United States did not ask to speak and the meeting was
adjourned until various draft resolutions criticizing Israel could
be reconciled.
   Soviet Ambassador Alexander M. Belonogov said most emigrating
Soviet Jews want to settle in the United States, not Israel.
   He said if the U.S. eased its entry reguirements for Soviet
immigrants, it would help reduce the concerns of Palestinians and
defuse tensions in the region.
   ``One sometimes hears appeals to the Soviet Union to stop Jews
leaving for Israel,'' Belonogov said, speaking in Russian through a
translator. ``But we cannot possibly undertake such a step because
it would be contrary to our overall course and policy of assuring
all Soviet citizens equal rights and freedoms, regardless of
nationality or ethnic origins.''
   ``The question is not for the Soviet Union to impose any
probitions,'' he told the 15-member council. ``The question is that
of Israel not allowing its ... citizens to settle in the occupied
territories.''
   Other nations and groups that spoke against Israel included the
Palestine Liberation Organization, Jordan, the Arab League,
Senegal, Malaysia and Cuba.
   They argued that Jewish settlement of the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip violates the principle of trading land for peace, which
they called vital to a Middle East settlement.
   Farouk Khadoumi, head of the political department of the PLO,
said Soviet Jewish immigration to Israel was organized by ``world
Zionism,'' while millions of Palestinians remained homeless and
stateless.
   Khadoumi called on the Security Council to impose sanctions
against Israel, like those against South Africa.
   The United States has also opposed the idea of settling Soviet
Jews in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, saying it is an obstacle to
making peace with Palestinians.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has suggested the occupied
territories are needed to accommodate Soviet Jewish immigrants.
Israel expects a wave of Soviet immigrants this year. Up to 500
have been arriving daily since the beginning of the year.
   But Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein, the acting permanent U.N.
representative, said Israel does not have a policy of directing
Jewish immigrants to the territories.
   ``Arab states have conjured up a major diplomatic storm in a
worldwide effort to block the flow of Jewish immigrants. The real
objective behind this campaign is to halt all Jewish immigration to
Israel. Period,'' Bein told the Security Council.
   He said those who oppose Jewish immigration to Israel refuse to
accept the reality of a secure and developing sovereign Jewish
state ``and persist in the dream of overrunning it.''
   In a related development Thursday, a Shiite Moslem group holding
hostages in Lebanon threatened attacks against airlines that carry
Soviet Jewish immigrants to Israel. The Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine group made the threat in a statement
released to a Beirut newspaper.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The army has chosen not to be
represented on a 19-member State Council that will govern Haiti
along with provisional President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, a
political leader said Thursday.
   Louis Roy, main author of the 1987 constitution, said that
instead a representative of The Women's Movement will be appointed
to the council, which will have veto power over the president's
decisions.
   Roy said the army voluntarily chose not to take a council seat,
even though the civilian political opposition had agreed to one
military representative.
   ``The army has decided to return to quarters and to remain
there,'' said council member Ernst Malebranche.
   This means the provisional government will be fully comprised of
civilians. Haiti has been ruled by the military since the fall of
the Duvalier family dictatorship in 1986.
   The State Council, representing such interests as human rights,
labor, civic organizations and the country's eight provinces, is to
be sworn in Friday at the National Palace.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, a Supreme Court judge and Haiti's first
woman president, was inaugurated Tuesday, one day after deposed
ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril fled into exile in the United States.
At her inauguration, Maj. Gen. Herard Abraham, the army chief of
staff, declared that the 6,000-member army was under her command.
   Roy, a member of the State Council, said the body would be
installed even though only 14 of its 19 members had been named as
of Thursday.
   ``We can't wait any longer,'' he said. ``The president has to
form her ministerial Cabinet and submit nominations to us for
approval.''
   A 12-member coalition of political leaders known as Unity
Assembly was considering potential Cabinet ministers to recommend
to Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot.
   Avril, who ruled Haiti for 18 months, resigned Saturday after
five days of violent protests nationwide. More than 25 people have
died and scores have been injured in violence before and after his
resignation.
   Port-au-Prince, the capital of more than 1 million people, was
relatively calm Thursday. Independent Radio Haiti Inter said an
army sergeant and two civilians were killed in an early morning
shootout between an army patrol and unidentified gunmen.
   Hundreds of government workers seeking the removal of corrupt
bosses returned to work after staging a series of brief walkouts
Wednesday that disrupted some public services and closed the
capital's airport.
   Hospital workers also were demanding the firing of corrupt
administrators. Both groups of employees remained on the job,
however.

   Friends and relatives of Terry
Anderson lit candles, prayed and began a 24-hour fast Thursday to
commemorate the journalist's fifth anniversary in captivity.
   About 180 people attended an interfaith service at Our Lady of
the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church in this Buffalo suburb, 40
miles from Anderson's boyhood home in Batavia. They signed pledges
to sacrifice food or something else of importance in honor of
Anderson and the 17 other Western hostages.
   ``Our commitment is to see the hostages released from their
captivity and reunited with their families without any further
delay,'' the congregation recited from a handout.
   ``We grieve for the sufferings and fears which oppress people in
the Middle East and elsewhere in the world and we join them in
their yearning for peace and freedom.''
   Penny Anderson, The Associated Press correspondent's
sister-in-law, and Carl Anderson, a cousin, were among those who
attended from Batavia. Also present was Anne Zickl, a Batavia
resident who has never met Anderson but has become a leader of
local efforts to secure his release.
   A procession of 60 children, one for each month of Anderson's
captivity since his abduction in Beirut on March 16, 1985, carried
paper cranes, a traditional Japanese symbol of peace.
   ``The peace crane has been a symbol of peace going back to the
time of Hiroshima,'' said Sister Pauline Petruzzella of the Sacred
Heart church. ``Tonight we gather with our lighted candles and our
paper cranes and we pray ... that these would be the words that
could free the hostages.''
   Other observances were planned Friday in New York City,
Washington, D.C., and Cyprus.
   Anderson, 42, AP's chief Middle East correspondent, is one of
eight American hostages. Ten other Westerners are held by
kidnappers in Lebanon.
   The Batavia group planned to break its fast at a Friday evening
service there, at which a new 15-minute music video to benefit the
Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson would be unveiled,
Mrs. Zickl said. A Friday service also was scheduled in Orchard
Park.
   Mrs. Zickl said the idea to fast 24 hours in support of Anderson
was conceived by Buffalo Area Metropolitan Ministries, an
ecumenical group, and was adopted enthusiastically by Peggy Say,
Anderson's sister and the leader of efforts to free the Western
hostages in Lebanon.
   Say will conduct her fast Friday in Washington, where she and
other relatives and families of other American hostages will gather
at noon in Lafayette Park, across from the White House.
   Scheduled speakers include Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.;
NBC News anchorman Tom Brokaw; CBS News anchorman Dan Rather,
broadcast personality Larry King and AP President and General
Manager Louis D. Boccardi.
   Say promoted the idea of a fast during her recent trip to the
Middle East on the hostages' behalf.
   ``It was received favorably most everywhere she went,
particularly by the foreign minister of Syria. She said his eyes
misted over,'' Mrs. Zickl said. ``In Islam, fasting is a major
part. It's a link between us.''
   Fasting, in Western religions, is a traditional way to focus
one's concerns on others, said the Rev. Francis Mazur, a Roman
Catholic priest who heads the ecumenical group's committee for the
Anderson ceremonies.
   ``We want to have some sort of self-denial to be in communion
with those who are less fortunate,'' Mazur said. Organizers learned
from the Rev. Lawrence Jenco, a former hostage, ``that there were
days when they went hungry, and days when they hid bread under
their mattresses.''
   Mazur said the group was encouraging all to join in, in one way
or another.
   ``People could just drink some kind of liquid fluid during this
period,'' he said. ``They could abstain from two full meals and
just eat one. They could abstain from caffeinated drinks if they're
heavy coffee drinkers.''
   Other commemorations Friday:
   _In Nicosia, Cyprus, the AP's Mideast hub, the
multidenominational Nicosia Community Church will conduct a
40-minute prayer service.
   _In Lorain, Ohio, Anderson's birthplace, supporters plan a
ceremony in front of city hall, and another at a Veterans of
Foreign Wars hall.
   _In New York City, an AP-arranged Mass will be conducted at St.
Patrick's Cathedral.

<HEAD>West German President Visits on 51st Anniversary of Nazi Invasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of West Germany
assured officials here Thursday, the 51st anniversary of the Nazi
invasion of Czechoslovakia, that his country has no territorial
claims on its neighbors.
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel welcomed the visit of his
collegue Richard Von Weizsaecker as a ``sign of great hope'' and a
counterpoint to the 1939 invasion.
   Havel made his own contribution to reconciliation by traveling
to East Germany and West Germany for his first state visits
following his election Dec. 29 as president.
   Weizsaecker is the first leader to pay a state visit to
Czechoslovakia since Havel became president after the peaceful
revolution that ousted the hard-line Communist leaders who had
ruled practically since the end of World War II.
   Recalling Germany as a ``messenger of war'' whose troops invaded
Czechoslovakia March 15, 1939, Havel said Weizsaecker was by
contrast a ``messenger of peace ... of glad tidings that violence
must nevermore prevail over freedom, lies over truth and evil over
human life.''
   ``Together we can strive for a democratic Europe, a Europe of
unity in diversity,'' Havel said.
   The invasion occurred after the Munich agreement of Britain and
France, which hoped to appease Adolf Hitler by giving him the
German-speaking part of Czechoslovakia.
   Hitler decided to invade on March 10, 1939, and German troops
were ordered to take up positions by the evening of March 12.
   When the Nazi troops had taken over, an ecstatic Hitler ordered
his two secretaries: ``You kids give me a kiss here and here,''
pointing to his cheeks, one of the women later recalled.
   Weizsaecker's visit came two days before a Prague meeting of
foreign ministers from the seven Warsaw Pact nations, called to
discuss the reunification of the Germany and its possible effects
on neighboring countries.
   ``From the ages we were closely united; we want to be again in
the future,'' Weizsaecker said.
   He talked of the dramatic democratic changes that have forced
Communists from power in most East bloc countries and led to the
fall of the Iron Curtain that divided Europe in the Cold War.
   ``Walls have fallen, fences been laid down, barbed wire cut. The
borders are open. We respect them without any restrictions and have
no territorial claims whatsoever towards any neighbor.''
   His remarks were intended to placate fears of Germany's
neighbors, particularly Poland, that a strong united Germany could
reclaim prewar territory.
   ``The whole of Europe must be grateful to Germans because they
began to tear down the wall which divided them, because by doing so
they started the tearing down of a wall which divides Europe,''
Havel said.
   He was referring to the Berlin Wall, which began to fall in
November with the East German revolution.
   But Havel also advised the Germanys to dispel European fears of
a united Germany.
   ``If, for example, they manage to unequivocally confirm the
final validity of existing borders, including those with Poland, or
if they manage to finally deal with those who still have the nerve
to flirt with Nazi ideology, they will do a lot to free Europe from
fear,'' Havel said. ``It is apparent that the fate of us all
depends today again predominantly on the development of Germany.
   ``I understand today's visit by President Weizsaecker as a true
counterpart of the old and painful visit that we remember today.
While that visit was an omen of terror and deepening despair,
today's visit is on the contrary a sign of great hope for us all.''

   Labor leader Shimon Peres toppled the coalition
government of hard-line Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Thursday
and declared that with his action, he had created ``momentum toward
peace.''
   Peres drove a no-confidence vote through Parliament after Shamir
had balked for weeks at U.S. proposals to get talks started with
the Palestinians.
   Shamir, the first premier in Israel's 42-year history to be
turned out of office by a no-confidence vote, listened to the vote
tally with his head down, glumly shuffling papers on his desk.
   ``We are not surprised ... and I am not sorry,'' he told
reporters later.
   Said Peres, who is likely to be picked to form a new government,
``Parliament has shown that there is a majority for peace. I
believe we can form a government that will reach a dialogue with
the Palestinians.''
   But little headway is considered likely in peace efforts as long
as Israel is consumed with internal poltics. Fashisoning a new
coalition government may take months.
   In London, visiting King Hussein of Jordan said Thursday the
United States must take more responsibility for Middle East peace
because of Israel's political crisis, and he warned that extremists
on both sides could endanger world peace.
   ``Something needs to be done and fast,'' he told a luncheon of
the Association of American Correspondents in London.
   Peres won on a 60-55 vote after a vitriolic debate and intense
behind-the-scenes bargaining that lasted 10 hours. The victory came
from a majority of those present and voting in the 120-member
Knesset, or parliament.
   The political crisis comes during a continuing Palestinian
insurrection in the occupied lands against Israeli rule. At least
663 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians
in the revolt that began in December 1987. Forty-three Israelis
also have been slain in the violence.
   As a result of Thursday's loss, Shamir, 74, a former underground
leader and spymaster for the Mossad secret service, could face an
uprising in his own Likud bloc.
   Trade Minister Ariel Sharon and Housing Minister David Levy,
both hawks who want to abandon the U.S. peace effort, have
repeatedly sought to oust Shamir from the party leadership, which
he assumed in 1983.
   Starting Sunday, aides said, President Chaim Herzog will canvass
parliament members as to who should form the next government. He is
expected to give the nod to Peres, who would have a maximum of six
weeks to assemble a coalition.
   In the interim, Shamir will stay on as head of a caretaker
government in which no ministers are allowed to resign and none can
be added.
   If Peres fails, Shamir or another Likud leader may be chosen to
form a government. If that fails, new elections may be called.
   The past two elections, in July 1984 and November 1988, ended in
virtual tie votes that forced the two big parties into coalitions.
   For Peres, trying to mesh leftist secular parties with
conservative religious factions will be a major test.
   In the past, Orthodox parties have demanded tougher laws to deal
with restaurants and stores that open on the Sabbath, a major
source of friction with liberal factions.
   Peres won primarily on a stay-away vote by five of the six
members of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, which allied with Likud
in the past.
   Shamir might have avoided the no-confidence vote if he had gone
to Herzog and resigned the government or survived it by agreeing to
a last-minute compromise from Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Shas' spiritual
leader.
   Yosef proposed acceptance of U.S. proposals for starting a
dialogue with Palestinians. Shamir stuck to his belief that the
U.S. ideas would give the PLO a role and jeopardize Israel's claim
to sovereignty over the captured Arab sector of Jerusalem.
   Shamir insisted his party was just as interested in making peace
as Labor. In unusually tough language, he accused Peres of making
concessions that benefited Israel's Arab enemies, such as his
endorsement of an international peace conference.
   Peres scoffed at Shamir's concerns, saying Shamir was the victim
of ``antiquated ideas'' and that the right-wing premier's
foot-dragging had been ``murdering the peace process.''

<TEXT>
   Iraq on Thursday hanged a London-based
journalist it accused of spying, touching off a storm of protest
from European governments. Britain recalled its ambassador from
Iraq and halted ministerial visits.
   ``Thatcher wanted him alive. We sent him in a box,'' Information
Minister Latif Nassayif Jassim said in announcing the execution.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher led the campaign to repeal the
death sentence imposed on 31-year-old Farzad Bazoft. Bazoft was
working for The Observer, a London weekly, investigating reports of
an explosion at an Iraqi military facility when he was arrested.
   Iraq accused Bazoft of spying for Israel and Britain, charges
Bazoft and his colleagues denied.
   Observer editor Donald Trelford and about 200 journalists held a
vigil outside the heavily guarded Iraqi Embassy in London.
Journalists left a single candle burning in Bazoft's memory in St.
Bride's church, Fleet Street, London's former newspaper row.
   ``It is an awful day for the newspaper,'' said Trelford. ``We
have had one of our number killed for simply being a reporter.''
   Arab governments stayed silent. Even Jordan's King Hussein, who
joined the Palestine Liberation Organization in appeals for
clemency, would not condemn President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association late Thursday
quoted unidentified British government sources as saying Bazoft
served a jail term in Britain for robbery.
   The sources were quoted as saying Bazoft was convicted at
Northampton, central England, in August 1981 of robbing a savings
and loan office of $765. He was said to have walked into the office
carrying a fake bomb and threatened to blow up the building unless
he was given the money.
   He was sentenced to 18 months in jail but with good conduct time
got out after a year, PA quoted the sources as saying.
   The agency quoted the sources as saying the jail term had no
bearing on diplomatic decisions taken by the Thatcher government
Thursday.
   President Hussein had said repeatedly that Iraq did not fear
Britain's anger, and the information minister repeated this after
the execution.
   ``It seems the British could not understand our psychology that
we are not intimidated,'' Jassim said. Hundreds of journalists from
government-run Iraqi media applauded. Jassim said Bazoft's body was
handed over to the British Embassy.
   In London, Mrs. Thatcher said, ``This is a very, very grave and
serious matter. The Iraqi government's action is an act of
barbarism which is deeply repugnant to all civilized people.''
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd announced that Ambassador Harold
Walker had been recalled from Baghdad. Hurd called off a trade
mission to Iraq and said all ministerial visits had been halted.
   Hurd also said all six Iraqi military trainees in Britain were
being ordered to leave the country. But he said there were no plans
to implement trade sanctions.
   Britain has a trade surplus of about $648 million with Iraq.
   Bazoft, an Iranian-born journalist, was detained in September
near a military industrial complex south of Baghdad. He was
investigating reports that hundreds of people had died in an
explosion at the complex in August.
   A British nurse, Daphne Parish, 52, was convicted on charges she
drove Bazoft to the Al-Iskandaria military complex and was
sentenced to 15 years in prison. Ms. Parish had been working as a
senior nursing administrator at an Irish-run hospital in the Iraqi
capital.
   Robin Kealy, the British general consul in Baghdad, visited
Bazoft shortly before his hanging at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad.
   In a British Broadcasting Corp. interview, Kealy said Bazoft
looked ``hollow-eyed and subdued'' and repeated that he was not a
spy.
   The first news of the execution in Iraqi media came on the
evening television news program.
   The broadcast include a televised statement first broadcast in
October in which Bazoft said he was a spy for Israel. He reportedly
said in court during his trial last week the statement was made
under duress.
   The television report said Bazoft was disguised as an Indian
doctor when arrested and was carrying maps he had drawn.
   Last year, Western diplomats in Baghdad confirmed there had been
an explosion at the Al-Iskandaria complex around Aug. 17.
   The London newspaper The Independent quoted unidentified
diplomats and Middle East sources as saying 700 people were killed,
including Egyptian engineers helping the Iraqis to develop a
ballistic missile.
   The Iraqis have said there was an explosion and fire at a fuel
depot in the area Aug. 17, 1989 and that 19 Iraqis were killed,
mainly firefighters.
   Bazoft, a stateless Iranian, was the son of an Iranian National
Oil Co. manager. He never returned to Iran after coming to Britain
as a teen-ager and was traveling in Iraq on British papers.
   As a journalist, he specialized in Middle East affairs.
   The European Parliament observed a minute's silence in Bazoft's
memory.
   Amnesty International said the execution was the latest in a
long list of ``severe and systematic human rights abuses,'' in Iraq.
   The International Press Institute based in London and Zurich
sent a cable to Hussein expressing ``outrage and shock.'' Britain's
National Union of Journalists said Bazoft paid a terrible price for
``the freedom of information.''
   In Paris, the Reporters Without Borders said Iraq had committed
a ``state crime.''
   The Bush administration expressed regret Thursday but did not
join the strong condemnation.
   On Bazoft's computer terminal in the Observer news room Thursday
were the words, ``May he rest in peace.'' His clippings lay nearby.

   A fire caused extensive damage to a chemical plant
outside Tripoli that is suspected of producing poison gas, and
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi on Thursday threatened to punish
West Germany if its agents set the blaze.
   West Germany, whose companies helped build the plant, denied the
accusation and filed a protest with Libya over an angry
demonstration outside Bonn's embassy in Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
   Gadhafi insisted that the heavily guarded plant in Rabta, 60
miles southwest of Tripoli, was designed to produce only
pharmaceuticals. But he said Libya would pay millions of dollars to
any company willing to build it a chemical weapons facility.
   ``In such eventuality, I will sign the contract myself
unhesitatingly,'' Gadhafi was quoted as saying by Libya's official
JANA news agency, which was monitored in Rome.
   He said Libya would not hesitate to manufacture weapons of
``total devastation'' if it had the ability, but he said it would
take 20 years for Libya to develop such weapons. Libya was accused
of using chemical weapons in its war against Chad.
   The plant, once described by CIA Director William Webster as the
world's largest chemical weapons factory, caught fire Wednesday.
There were conflicting reports about damage and how the fire
started.
   Late Thursday, a senior U.S. official in Washington said the
United States had used its ``intelligence resources'' to conclude
the plant was inoperable. U.S. intelligence resources are known to
include satellites capable of high-resolution photography.
   ABC News quoted unidentified Libyan security sources as claiming
the plant was burned to the ground by U.S. and Israeli agents. The
United States and Israel denied involvement.
   A previously unknown group of Libyan dissidents, the
Organization of the Patriotic Wing of the Libyan Army, claimed
responsibility for the blaze in a statement sent to West Germany's
ARD television network.
   The White House said last week the plant posed a serious danger
and called for ``vigorous efforts'' to stop its operation.
   From Bush on down Thursday, the administration denied any
involvement in the blaze.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We don't
have any idea who did it. ... Somebody could have knocked over a
kerosene lamp or something.'' He said damage was extensive, but the
building still stood.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said, ``We have
had various ... reports of accidents at the plant before the
current fire.''
   Mahmoud Azzabi, press secretary at Libya's U.N. mission in New
York, said there was speculation saboteurs infiltrated Libya from
neighboring Tunisia.
   A journalist for JANA, reached by telephone from Cairo, said he
was unsure whether there were casualties in the fire but said the
plant was badly damaged.
   ``You may consider it has been burned down,'' he said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Yitzhak Rabin, who resigned as Israel's defense minister
Tuesday, denied Israel was involved in the fire and called the
speculation ``nonsense.''
   The JANA report quoted Gadhafi as saying that the cause of the
blaze was under investigation. He said if investigators prove West
German intelligence services were involved, ``the presence of
Germany economically will be eliminated and the country involved in
espionage and subversion for imperialism and Zionism will lose.''
   West Germany's ambassador in Tripoli was summoned to meet with
Libya's Foreign Office, but no threats were made during the
meeting, according to a West German government official in Bonn.
   In Bonn, the Foreign Ministry summoned a Libyan diplomat to
protest a demonstration by about 800 Libyan demonstrators who
temporarily blockaded access to the West German Embassy in Tripoli.
   Charges by the United States that German companies helped build
the Rabta plant caused a major scandal in West Germany slightly
over a year ago. West Germany at first denied the claims, but later
acknowledged them and launched its own investigations.
   For more than 14 months, the United States has accused Libya of
using the plant to make chemical weapons, including mustard and
nerve gases.
   When Western reporters were taken to the chemical plant in
January 1989, they found it guarded by soldiers, tanks and
surface-to-air missiles. The journalists were not allowed to
inspect the plant.
   Libya's Radio Tripoli urged Arab support for Libya in the face
of ``an aggressive campaign of American imperialism.''
   ``The American campaign against the pharmaceutical factory at
Rabta is a conspiracy against this important strategic achievement,
which should furnish medicine for the entire Arab nation and break
the foreign monopoly in this area,'' said the broadcast, monitored
in Tunis.
   The United States engaged in hostilities with Libya three times
in the 1980s, twice shooting down Libyan fighter planes and bombing
Tripoli in 1986 in retaliation for what former President Reagan
said was terrorism against Americans in Europe.

   Wyoming became the 46th state to honor
Martin Luther King Jr.'s ideals when Gov. Mike Sullivan signed
legislation Thursday creating a state holiday dedicated to equal
rights.
   Although Wyoming calls itself the Equality State because it was
the first to give women the vote, it took years for lawmakers to
agree to set aside the third Monday in January in King's honor.
   Legislative leaders opposed to the holiday questioned whether
King should be singled out, noting that many other Americans also
fought for civil rights.
   The legislation Sullivan signed into law creates ``Martin Luther
King Jr. Wyoming Equality Day.''
   Championing the measure for the past eight years has been state
Sen. Liz Byrd, the Legislature's only black.
   ``It was a real disappointment each year to watch the failure of
the Martin Luther King Jr. legislation in the Wyoming
Legislature,'' she told the crowd jamming the Statehouse rotunda
for the signing ceremony. ``Those years of trying to get this
legislation passed were trying times. But today is a happy day.
Today is a historic day.
   ``What a wonderful centennial gift to be here today and to have
this bill,'' Byrd added, referring to Wyoming's 100th birthday this
July 10.
   The King holiday did not come easily. Senate opponents urged the
body to reject a holiday in King's name and support one simply
commemorating equal rights.
   The House also was uneasy with the holiday in King's name only
and added the Wyoming Equality Day provision to the legislation.
   The four states that do not recognize the King holiday are
Arizona, Montana, Idaho and New Hampshire.

   Relentless thunderstorms that have hammered the Plains with
tornadoes set off another twister attack Thursday in Mississippi,
and a snowstorm suprised the upper Midwest and closed schools.
   The heat wave that has gently toasted much of the eastern half
of the nation continued to set high temperature records.
   Thunderstorms have spawned damaging tornadoes this week in
Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and Illinois.
   This week's unusual winter heat wave and storms began with a
strong low pressure system that moved through the Rockies onto the
Plains, explained Ed Ferguson of the National Severe Storms
Forecast Center in Kansas City, Mo.
   ``In advance of that, we had a strong flow of warm air move
through the Plains. These strong southerly winds brought a lot of
warm temperatures and high humidities,'' Ferguson said. ``In fact,
that strong flow of air existed from the Gulf of Mexico to the
Great Lakes.
   ``Those warm temperatures and high humidities set the stage then
for strong thunderstorm development because warm, moist air from
the Gulf of Mexico was colliding with cooler, drier air from the
northwest.''
   As for the snow in the north, he said: ``The parent low pressure
system is still moving slowly. Up north, we're still dealing with
what the system can produce.''
   Ferguson said the tornado that devastated Hesston, Kan., on
Tuesday ``was a history-maker.''
   ``That tornado was head and shoulders above the ordinary
tornado. It was very violent,'' he said. ``It had abnormally high
wind speeds, probably in excess of 250 miles an hour. It was the
longest tracked tornado in recent years and maybe stands out among
the top 10 since records were kept since 1950.''
   Temperatures hit record highs in the 60s, 70s and 80s again
Thursday in Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, Maryland, New York,
Massachusetts, Vermont, North Carolina, New Hampshire,
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Rhode Island, Delaware, Connecticut and
the District of Columbia, the National Weather Service reported.
For some cities it was the fourth consecutive day of record warmth.
   Thunderstorms dumped more than 6 inches of rain on parts of
southwestern Alabama on Thursday, causing some street flooding that
threatened homes in low-lying areas. A tornado in a sparsely
populated area of Baldwin County flipped two mobile homes off their
foundations.
   Severe thunderstorms pounded Mississippi in advance of a
slow-moving cold front and a tornado smashed a path of damage
through rural George County, injuring five people, including three
children, whose mobile home was smashed.
   ``It knocked my trailer over, picked it up and dropped it back
again,'' Rai Smith, 21, said in a telephone interview from her
hospital room in Lucedale. ``When it all stopped, the walls became
the floor and the bathroom door was directly above me.''
   Smith, who is four months pregnant, said she managed to climb up
to the bathroom door and ease past a washing machine ``before it
fell down into the area that I had just left.''
   George County authorities said two mobile homes, including the
Smith family's, were destroyed. In addition, Sheiff Eugene Howell
said two houses were damaged and several roads were blocked by
downed trees.
   Biloxi got 4.3 inches of rain between 6 a.m. and noon. Several
sections of the state suffered power outages.
   The sky was mostly sunny Thursday across Oklahoma, but two days
of steady downpours swelled creeks and rivers and threatened some
parts of the state with flooding.
   Okmulgee County appeared to be in the most danger. Flood stage
for the Deep Fork there is about 18 feet, and the weather service
said it probably would crest at about 31 feet by Friday morning.
   Okmulgee Sheriff Jim Hart said several residents who live near
the river had already evacuated but two families waited too long
and deputies had to evacuate the families from their homes on
horseback, leaving their belongings behind.
   ``The water was up to the horses' bellies,'' he said.
   To the north, a storm plastered western Iowa with up to 9 inches
of sticky snow Thursday and brought minor flooding and gusty wind
to the rest of the state.
   ``It was pretty much of a surprise,'' said weather service
meteorologist Jeff Hutton, adding that heavy snow had been forecast
for eastern Nebraska and instead fell much further east.
   He said the snow in western Iowa and rain elsewhere was brought
by a vigorous low pressure system racing north directly over the
state.
   ``It's an intense surface low that pulled down the cold air and
wrapped it around,'' he said.
   The storm socked southwestern Minnesota with heavy, wet snow
mixed with sleet and freezing rain and forced the closing of at
least 28 schools. Up to 10 inches of snow was possible.
   North Dakota was under a winter storm warning as snow and gusty
north wind threatened the state with near blizzard conditions.
Snowfall amounts were expected to range from 4 inches in the west
to 10 inches in the east, the weather service said.
   Wind gusted to 100 mph at Rapid, S.D., and high wind blew across
Minnesota and Wisconsin.
   In Wyoming, wind blowing at more than 25 mph whipped up snow and
cut visibility to zero along slippery highways, forcing the Highway
Patrol to close a 45-mile stretch of Interstate 80.
   Traffic also was kept off 14 miles of Interstate 25 from
Cheyenne south to the Colorado line off and on because of
accidents. No injuries were reported.

   During his 16 years on the road, trucker
Roosevelt Jones had to rely on telephones to contact his company,
often phoning dispatchers thousands of miles away to report trouble
or receive instructions.
   Now, without leaving his rig, he can send and receive messages
in seconds using a satellite system that is revolutionizing the
trucking industry.
   Besides providing speedy communications, the system features
special truck transmitters that enable dispatchers to monitor each
vehicle's travels and pinpoint its location. Customers can get
hourly updates on the status of shipments.
   ``All the folks that have them in their trucks seem to like
them,'' said Jones, a driver for Wingate-Taylor Maid Transportation
Inc., a subsidiary of Burlington Motor Carriers.
   Burlington, the nation's fourth-largest truck load carrier, is
installing the satellite system in 2,000 trucks operated by its
four subsidiaries: Wingate-Tailor Maid of Albany, Ga.; Stoops
Express of Anderson, Ind.; Monroe Trucking of Monroe, La.; and
Monkem of Joplin, Mo.
   Joanne Rang, executive director of the American Trucking
Association, said satellite tracking is still relatively new and
represents a substantial investment for companies. Firms willing to
make the investment should be able to monitor shipments more
closely and provide better service to their customers, she said in
an interview from her Alexandria, Va., office.
   Mike Hodson, Burlington's vice president for quality, said the
company evaluated several systems before selecting one developed by
Hughes Network Systems of Germantown, Md.
   During an eight-month study, Burlington trucks equipped with
satellite communications ran more miles, ran fewer empty miles and
ran the most direct routes, Hodson said in a phone interview from
his Hurst, Texas, office.
   The system proved it could reduce waste, lower operating costs,
give Burlington a competitive edge and improve its drivers' quality
of life, he said.
   Drivers who rely on phones have to interrupt trips to check in
with their companies. They call from truck stops, rest areas or any
other place with safe parking.
   After delivering their cargos, they often have to phone
dispatchers repeatedly, sometimes for lengthy periods, for
instructions on picking up new loads.
   ``He ends up at some truck stop drinking coffee, smoking
cigarettes, shooting the breeze,'' Hodson said. ``Now he can sleep
and wait for a beeper to go off. We think it's going to create a
safer fleet because the guys are going to be better rested.''
   The Burlington drivers communicate via a small keyboard that
displays messages on a tiny screen. They can select routine
messages and fill in blank spaces with details, or type in special
messages. For safety, the truckers can't send messages while
driving.
   The message is beamed to a satellite and then down to a dish
antenna in Washington, D.C., where it is decoded. It then is sent
back to the satellite and down to Burlington's message center in
Joplin, Mo. From there it is relayed to the subsidiaries by
telephone line.
   Dispatchers sitting at computer terminals can communicate with
drivers or ask the computer to list the locations of all trucks
they are supervising.
   ``It's going to improve our efficiency,'' said Mike Driggers,
Wingate-Tailor Maid's vice president of operations.
   As driver Jones prepared to make his first trip with the new
system, he met with instructor Rodney Hogan to learn how to operate
the keyboard and transmit messages.
   ``It seems kind of odd to me because I never used it before,''
he said before pointing his white Freightliner toward Amarillo,
Tex. ``Once I get used to it, I think I'll like it better than a
phone.''

<HEAD>Coming to America: Japanese Becoming Partners With U.S. Colleges</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SHARON COHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In a remote little patch of Iowa, where soybeans are hot and
sushi is not, the new talk of the town is teikei. That's Japanese
for partnership.
   Two cultures and two countries are coming together in Le Mars,
Iowa, in the marriage of two schools: cash-hungry Westmar College
and Teikyo University in Tokyo.
   ``Our community just got bigger and the world just got
smaller,'' said Arthur Richardson, president of the new Teikyo
Westmar University, after a plan was approved this month that will
bring new dollars and new students _ from Japan _ to the Iowa
school.
   Across America, the Japanese are investing hundreds of millions
of dollars in a small but growing number of colleges and
universities, many struggling for survival. Some are joint programs
or mergers. In a few cases, they're building from bottom up; a $250
million school is planned near Washington, D.C.
   ``It's a win-win situation,'' Richardson said. ``They win an
accredited, four-year education in the States. We win the student
population, the market niche and the dollars to improve salaries
and facilities.''
   Teikyo, which has 26,000 students in Japan and branches in
Britain and the Netherlands, already has links with schools in
Colorado and West Virginia. Another Japanese investor has bought a
share of an Oregon college.
   Though the entry into higher education isn't big _ only a few
thousand students will be added to the 24,000 Japanese students
already here _ or as splashy as the sale of New York's Rockefeller
Center, it stirs the same divided sentiments.
   ``It's good in that the Japanese really want to be international
because they're stung by charges they're too insular and unknowing
of the outside world,'' said John Sylvester, director of the North
Carolina Japan Center at North Carolina State University. ``If
you're putting a bad spin on it, you'd say the Japanese are trying
to go out and conquer foreign markets in just about everything.''
   Some, however, insist this isn't business rivalry.
   ``It isn't a market Japan is taking away,'' said Michael Young,
a professor of Japanese law at Columbia University, now on leave at
the State Department. ``We should be tremendously flattered.''
   Indeed, Sylvester said, the Japanese respect the American
university system. Japanese education through high school is
generally tougher than in this country, he said, but ``our
universities as a rule are more rigorous than theirs.''
   Education isn't the only lure. Teikyo's ties here make it ``much
more prestigious,'' said Robert Helmick, legal consultant to the
Japanese school.
   And Japanese colleges can make money by having the attraction of
a foreign campus, Sylvester said.
   But educators also note most Japanese schools involved aren't
first-rate institutions. ``You're not going to find the really
fast-track males coming here,'' Young said.
   Still, the American partners aren't complaining. They receive
money, students and, they hope, a better image.
   Take Salem College, a poor school in West Virginia with no
endowment and 400 students, until last summer's merger with Teikyo.
   An initial $12 million investment erased the school's debt and
raised faculty salaries an average of 27 percent, said Ronald Ohl,
president of the new Salem-Teikyo University.
   ``Being debt-free and having some financial stability in and of
itself is just a novel experience,'' he said.
   The school expects to spend $40 million to $60 million on
improvements, equipment and staff, he said, and boost average SAT
scores from about 700 to 1,200 in four years _ by being more
selective in admitting U.S. students.
   Thousands of miles away, Geos Corp., a Japanese company
operating English-language schools around the world, has bought a
49 percent share of Warner Pacific College in Portland, Ore., for
$6 million. The 450-student liberal arts school will buy back its
assets after 30 years.
   Last year's deal improved the school's finances and ``more doors
have opened to us in the business community and economic
community,'' said administrative vice president Arthur Kelly.
   Money isn't always the motive. Regis College, a Jesuit school in
Denver operating with a balanced budget for 14 years, sold one of
its seven campuses to Teikyo for a reported $6.5 million and will
develop an American-style curriculum for Japanese students.
   Not everyone is as receptive. Phillips University in Enid,
Okla., wasn't interested in a tentative $24 million purchase offer
made by the head of the Kyoto Institute of Technology.
   ``It's like trying to sell the congregation of a church,'' said
President Richard Peck. ``How can you sell 51 percent of the board
of deacons of a church? It doesn't work.''
   The offer was withdrawn, but Phillips, with Kyoto's owner,
established two satellite campuses in Japan and soon will open a
third.
   The Japanese also have other plans here, including a two-year
college in Maryland and Washington International University in
Loudoun County, Va., a $250 million project. Both are for American
and Japanese students.
   On a much smaller scale, Tokyo International University has
built a branch adjacent to its sister school, Willamette University
in Salem, Ore.
   ``This is a start for our students to learn the American way to
do business, their education and lifestyle,'' said Ryuji Torihara,
dean of administration of the one-year program.
   In Le Mars, an agricultural community of about 8,000 people, up
to 200 Japanese students arrive in April. Formal classes start this
fall at the school, celebrating its 100th birthday.
   The chairman of the board of trustees resigned, protesting the
Westmar president's secret discussions with Teikyo and arguing the
decision was reached too quickly. And the United Methodist Church,
which provides $90,000 to the college, has raised questions about
future ties to the 566-student school.
   But the trustees approved the deal and Teikyo's gift _
Richardson says it's several million dollars _ has provided
security and double-digit raises in a school that was near
financial collapse in the mid-1980s.
   Much remains to be settled, including the makeup of the new
board of trustees. Helmick said he'll recommend the majority be
American, though in Salem it's the reverse.
   The school plans to have an exchange work program, which Helmick
said will give students an edge. ``Companies in the United States
and Japan are spending a lot of money learning how to do business
in another country,'' he said. ``We think our graduates will
already have that knowledge.''
   Richardson sees one obstacle: cultural adjustment. ``That's
where the hard work and long haul takes place,'' he said.
   But Mayor Bonnie Dull noted the English, Germans and Dutch all
settled in the area and ``assimilated very well. I can't see why
there would be a difference.''
   ``A lot of it depends on the students,'' said Kathy Faber, news
editor at the Le Mars Daily Sentinel. ``If they're willing to come
out in the community and say, `Here I am,' folks are going to say,
`We're glad you're here.'''

   Shoichi Okinaga says he believes that Japanese and
American students learning together will promote understanding and
friendship between the two countries, and the world will gain.
   ``So I decided to acquire colleges in the United States,'' said
Okinaga, the wealthy president of Teikyo University, which has
bought into colleges in Colorado, Iowa and West Virginia.
   Japanese plans call for spending at least $320 million to buy or
build universities abroad.
   Okinaga said he plans to spend 10 billion yen, or $70 million,
over two years to develop academic homes for Japanese students
overseas, as well as to give foreign students more knowledge of
Japan.
   A slower approach is coordinated by Toshio Yamaguchi, an
influential legislator of the governing Liberal Democratic Party,
who backs a $250 million plan to build a university outside
Washington, D.C., with courses taught in both Japanese and English.
   Behind Yamaguchi is EIE International Corp., a Japanese
conglomerate with such real estate holdings as the Beverly Wilshire
Hotel in California, resorts and hotels on the Gold Coast in
Australia, and an interest in Bond University, a project started by
troubled Australian financier Alan Bond.
   Jiro Yaginuma, spokesman for EIE International, said the company
also plans a private university in Europe and foresees an eventual
link among institutions in Australia, Europe and the United States.
   Asked if profit was the motive, Yaginuma replied: ``Everyone can
understand that this is not an instant profit-making project. It
takes time to become profitable or even break even. So we are
patient enough to wait until such time.''
   Backers of the plans to put Japanese universities in the United
States list high motives: to increase Japan-U.S. understanding,
advance the ability of young Japanese in the English language, meet
the growing desire of young Americans to study Japanese and develop
internationally minded leaders of tomorrow.
   Yamaguchi said he was driven partly by his ``inferiority complex
_ being an internationalist who doesn't speak English.''
   His planned school is to be called Washington International
University and will be located in Loudoun County, Va., opening for
its first undergraduates in 1993.
   In the 1988-89 school year, about 24,000 Japanese students
attended American colleges and universities, and Yamaguchi said
many of them fail because their English isn't good enough.
   To help negotiate the language barrier, Washington International
University will permit entering Japanese students to take two years
of courses in Japanese while studying English. Americans could take
their last two years in Japanese after studying the language.
   The push to establish Japanese schools in the United States
comes as more than 30 U.S. colleges have sprouted branches in Japan
or announced plans to open branches in the past few years, meeting
the growing thirst for U.S.-style higher education.
   Japanese education has a reputation for producing top-notch high
school graduates, but critics say universities don't produce enough
people with foreign-language skills and, with the exception of top
schools, do not demand hard work.
   U.S. universities, by contrast, are thought to develop more
creative graduates, and it's noted that Japan has produced few
Nobel Prize winners compared to the United States.
   Yamaguchi said he had visited Washington often as chairman of
the Foreign Affairs Committee in the lower house of Parliament and
was impressed with the Virginia countryside, which he said
``reflects the American spirit of independence.''
   ``Its natural and historical background, plus rich human
resources in Washington and young people from all over the world,
will create an ideal educational environment,'' he said.

   The tanker Exxon Valdez, its hull ripped apart
a year ago on Alaska's Bligh Reef, is a ship without a name as it
undergoes repairs.
   Fresh gray paint covers the name synonymous with environmental
catastrophe.
   The $30 million repair job, which began last August, is about 70
percent complete, and the tanker should be released to Exxon in
July, said Fred Hallett, vice president and chief financial officer
of National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co.
   It could be hauling crude oil again this summer, but under what
name and where have not yet been determined, said Exxon Shipping
Co. spokeswoman Carrie Chassin.
   Exxon Shipping president Frank Iarossi, sensitive to the
vessel's virtually indelible association with the environmental
disaster, has said the ship may be given a ``fresh start'' under a
new name away from Alaska, perhaps the Gulf of Mexico.
   Nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil poured into Prince
William Sound on March 24, 1989, after rocks ripped into the hull
of the 987-foot tanker.
   A couple of boulders that lodged in the Valdez were removed at
the shipyard and, after being examined by parties in the spill
litigation, were released to Exxon, which had them ground up at a
construction site, Chassin said.
   The single-skinned tanker is being restored to its original
specifications, despite some studies showing that equipping ships
with double bottoms or hulls would prevent or reduce spillage in
the event of an accident.
   Exxon Shipping officials determined that ``retrofitting the
entire vessel from an engineering standppoint was not feasible,''
Chassin said.
   ``Basically the whole bottom has been rebuilt,'' said Peter
Zschiesche, business representative for the machinists union at the
shipping company. ``The middle of the bottom, that's been ripped
out, back to front. Then they went in and started putting those
pieces back'' in 100-ton steel segments.
   Still to be completed is patching on the mangled starboard side,
which bore the brunt of the grounding.
   When the repairs are completed, the bottom will be coated with
3,000 tons of inch-thick steel.
   The Valdez arrived last July at the shipyard, where it was built
in 1986, after being towed 2,500 miles from Alaska.
   ``Literally all of her starboard side was gone,'' Hallett said.
``You could stand underneath the ship and look 70 feet up at the
main deck. I don't think anybody has seen that kind of damage in
peacetime and have a ship survive.''

   For some people, ``A Chorus Line'' was more than
a musical. It was a way of life.
   Alyce Gilbert has worked on Broadway's longest-running show
since the beginning, from its first preview performances at the New
York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater in April 1975 to its
opening at Broadway's Shubert Theater the following July and
throughout its 15-year run.
   Now, her job and those of its 58 other production people, 26
musicians and 34 dancers will end April 28 when ``A Chorus Line''
closes after 6,137 performances.
   Gilbert is the musical's wardrobe mistress, a quaint title for
someone who must deal with four loads of dirty laundry every
workday _ and twice on matinee days. That's not to mention her
finding, getting repaired and keeping track of shoes, socks,
buttons, glass beads, leotards, pants, jump suits, jackets and top
hats during what usually is a 12-hour day or longer.
   ``Wardrobe is about continuity,'' says the woman who first
looked after costumes at age 12 for a children's theater company in
her hometown of Milwaukee. ``It's not design. It's about things
staying the same or kept within a certain parameter.''
   Gilbert has the responsibility of maintaining the show's
costumes designed by three-time Tony winner Theoni V. Aldredge. She
has had to make the replacement clothes look the way Aldredge
intended them to look a decade and a half ago. That can mean a lot
of problems.
   ``You're dealing with some things that are rather firmly rooted
in the fashion of 1975 that don't exist anymore,'' Gilbert says.
   For one thing, dance clothes have changed. When ``A Chorus
Line'' first opened, dancewear mostly was nylon Helanca. Now, it's
Milliskin, made out of Lycra, a shiny, spandex fiber, that prevails.
   ``Everything in the world is made out of that now,'' Gilbert
says. So the musical's nylon dance clothes have to be specially
ordered. And then all the dancewear, except for the women's black
leotards, has to be dyed.
   ``Theoni's colors are very specific,'' Gilbert says. ``All the
women in the show wear some kind of red, from pink to lavender to
burgundy to maroon. The men are dressed in blues, browns and greens.
   ``We took the bell-bottoms out of the pants in 1981. It took a
long time before they went out of dance pants primarily because it
makes your legs look longer and that's something dancers always
love.''
   Gilbert has witnessed not only a revolution in dancewear but a
change in the shapes of the dancers themselves.
   ``It used to be a very long, thin chorus line,'' she says.
``Over the 15 years, it's become a much more athletic body. Dancers
go to gyms. They pump. They do very distinct things to build bulky
muscles which you never saw in 1975. It was not aesthetically
pleasing then, but somewhere along the line, the public's eye
changed and so did the choreographer's'.''
   Gilbert's workday usually has begun at 10 a.m. in the basement
of the Shubert in a catacomb-like space crammed with racks and
boxes of costumes in every size and color.
   ``It's the buy-it-when-you-see-it-and-keep-it syndrome,'' she
laughs. ``We've got a lot of weird stuff around.''
   Here she starts the day's first load of laundry. The dancewear
is washed after each performance in a cold-water detergent. The
glittery finale costumes are pressed and checked for broken beads.
Different dressers _ the show has five _ have ``bead-in'' calls to
go over the finale costumes to replace beads.
   ``That costume has become a symbol of what Broadway is,''
Gilbert says. Director Michael Bennett originally asked Aldredge
for red finale clothes, similar to what he had used in ``Follies,''
but she came up with her own unique design.
   ``It is based on everything being reflected,'' Gilbert says.
``Everything shines. The fabrics. The shoes. The men's are patent
leather, the women's are satin. The beads are glass. When the light
hits those clothes, they look gold. They look silver. They look
white. It's amazing what vanishes from them in terms of wear.''
   During the day, Gilbert deals with whatever has to be replaced
or repaired. Toward evening, the stage manager wanders by and
announces who will be on stage that night. ``A Chorus Line'' is a
show in which understudies get a chance to perform frequently. That
means hauling out finale costumes for the replacement dancers.
   About a half hour before curtain, the five dressers come in. The
dancewear has been separated onto hangers, one costume to a hanger,
and sent to the dressing rooms.
   While the musical starts, the finale costumes are set on racks
at the side of the stage for the evening's splashy closing number.
During the show, Gilbert and the dressers fuss with the costume
worn by Cassie, the lead female dancer, and then get ready for the
finale. When the dressers go to help with the dancers' finale
changes, Gilbert goes, too. She personally hands out the top hats
to them.
   ``You're dealing with 17 people and 17 hats that look the
same,'' she says. ``We don't keep the hats with finale costumes
because it's dark. It's easy to come up with the wrong hat if
you're not focusing on that.''
   The process is repeated eight times a week.
   ``You're in a rather unique position doing wardrobe,
particularly in this show,'' says Gilbert, who got her start in
1968 doing shows off-Broadway. ``I've learned that dancers are
really so gallant. They can be silly. They can be petty. They can
be lots of things. But when they have to go out and dance, there's
an extraordinary bravery.
   ``All dance ever really gives them is the chance to be able to
do it. Anything else is extra.''
   Gilbert took two 6-month leaves from ``A Chorus Line'' over the
years to work on two other Bennett shows, ``Ballroom'' and
``Dreamgirls.'' She always came back.
   When ``A Chorus Line'' closes, she'll move over to ``Grand
Hotel,'' the Tommy Tune musical that has lavish 1920s-style
costumes. ``And then there will probably be other shows,'' she adds
wistfully.

   After nearly three decades of bushwhacking
trails for women in the male-dominated workplace, Felice N.
Schwartz has spent much of the past year fighting accusations she
is a traitor.
   She hasn't capitulated. On the contrary, the dispute with some
influential feminists seems to have sharpened.
   Schwartz is the founder of a prominent corporate consulting firm
in Manhattan called Catalyst, which promotes sexual equality at
work and was spawned during the feminist movement of the early
1960s.
   It now is one of the leading advisers on women's issues to large
American businesses. Schwartz's connections give her access to the
heads of companies ranging from Citibank to Sara Lee Corp.
   Last year Schwartz hurtled herself into the public eye by
writing a widely read article that became associated with the
buzzword ``mommy track,'' though she didn't invent the term and has
repudiated it many times.
   She asserted in the article, titled ``Management Women and the
New Facts of Life,'' that women's growing role in the work force
has forced companies to become more responsive and sensitive to
their needs to attract and retain the most talented.
   But the article, published in the January-February 1989 issue of
Harvard Business Review, created an uproar among women. It was
perceived as distinguishing two paths for management women, a fast
one for the strictly career-driven and childless and a slower
dead-end route for those who want to raise families.
   Other well-known women activists quickly distanced themselves
from Schwartz and accused her of giving companies an excuse to put
women down after many years of steady advances.
   They said her assertions amounted to a stark choice between
career and family, reinforced sexual stereotypes and assumed the
burden of child-rearing remained strictly a woman's domain.
   Schwartz, a 65-year-old grandmother and tough-talking corporate
executive in her own right, has rejected those accusations, blaming
them partly on misunderstandings and distortions of her position.
   She has faced the criticism with a mixture of defiance, anguish,
frustration and humility, debating her feminist adversaries and
articulating her position hundreds of times in speeches and
interviews.
   ``The purpose of that article was to encourage corporate leaders
to make progress in assimilating women at every level of management
and to remove barriers to their advancement,'' she said at a
conference in January, for example.
   ``I wrote of the need for employers to revise their thinking,
their policies and their practices in order to meet the needs of
employees who choose to combine work and family.''
   Having to explain herself more than a year later shows how
difficult the ``mommy track'' stigma has been to dislodge.
   Nonetheless, Schwartz said in an interview, she would not change
a word of the article or where she chose to publish it.
   ``I wanted the Harvard Business Review because I wanted to reach
corporate leaders. This was not an article for women,'' she said.
``I did not write the article for Good Housekeeping, Ms. or Working
Woman.''
   But the article provoked such concern from women that Harvard
Business Review sold 11,000 reprints. Schwartz was besieged with
press requests from women's magazines and foreign journalists from
Venezuela to Australia.
   She did 75 interviews in two months, often encountering what she
called the same misinterpretations of her arguments. Many times,
she spent much of the time denying and disavowing the ``mommy
track'' idea.
   Schwartz said her patience finally expired during a broadcast
with a West Coast radio station, when she exploded at her
interviewer because the woman admitted she hadn't read the article.
   ``That was a catharsis,'' she said.
   In some ways, the controversy has further enhanced her
influence, which has grown steadily since she founded Catalyst in
1962 as a research and consulting service to help women re-enter
the work force after raising families, something she did herself
after taking an eight-year break to raise three children.
   In the past year, speaking invitations have multiplied from
colleges, institutes and business conferences, Schwartz said. She
said women ranging from MBA candidates to CIA employees have
approached her with positive comments.
   ``I'm absolutely euphoric. It's opened discussion to issues that
had been submerged,'' she said. ``What I want to do is encourage
honesty and openness.''
   Many influential professional women have expressed admiration
for Schwartz's ability to reach into male-dominated corporate
bastions so boldly, though they have mixed feelings about what she
says.
   ``I think what she did was very good because it brought the
issue to the table,'' said Deborah Biondolillo, vice president of
human resources for the computer company Apple USA. ``I didn't
happen to agree with her solutions.''
   Schwartz has failed to appease her most vociferous critics,
prominent feminists who think her approach is misguided, elitist,
arrogant and destructive.
   Many still believe she has perpetuated the ``mommy track'' idea
despite her denials.
   ``Her article was a very dangerous retrogression and
acquiescence to sex discrimination,'' said Betty Friedan, a
co-founder of the National Organization for Women and author of
``The Feminine Mystique,'' considered one of the most important
books about the women's movement.
   ``I have not changed one iota in my mind my outrage at Felice
Schwartz,'' Friedan said. ``She is simply not a feminist, not
committed to equality. She has an employer mentality.''
   Even some less militant proponents of women's rights are
concerned that Schwartz has hurt their efforts to obtain
professional parity with men. Some say she has further isolated
herself by suggesting women disclose at job interviews whether they
plan to have children.
   ``Women are still getting fired from their jobs when they're
pregnant. I don't know why she thinks we have that kind of
protection,'' said Judsen Culbreth, editor of Working Mother
magazine.
   ``Putting this burden on women is just such backward thinking,
just such 1950s, man-in-the-pinstripe-suit-type thinking,''
Culbreth said. ``I don't think she's meant to do this, but it
particularly does damage to working mothers, who are going to have
this question mark raised now in the minds of so many
corporations.''
   Both Schwartz and her critics have said the discussion is
helpful.
   Still, Schwartz said, ``I am sure there are still lots of women
who think I'm their enemy. That's painful after 27 years.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush may not believe in his lofty
poll ratings, but the Democrats seem to, and that is keeping them
cautious _ or maybe timid.
   That's a label they have tried to affix to Bush, who says the
correct description of his style is prudent. Call it timidity, or
caution, or prudence, the tag applies on Capitol Hill as at the
White House.
   While Democrats complain that Bush is trying to avoid
politically risky positions, most of them are doing the same thing.
They just aren't as visible. With Bush riding high in the
popularity polls, their challenges usually are safe, rhetorical and
standard.
   There are exceptions.
   Three leading Democrats in Congress have proposed three
controversial policy and budget moves so far this year. None has
drawn broad support at the top or among the re-election-bent rank
and file members of the party that controls both House and Senate.
   Any or all of the three could serve as high-visibility rallying
points for the opposition party. But they got faint praise and no
endorsement from Democratic congressional leaders.
   The latest Democratic initiative is Rep. Dan Rostenkowski's
budget balancing proposal, a combination of spending cut and tax
increases he called ``both bold and balanced.'' It's all of that, a
compromise that would compel each party to swallow some unpleasant
medicine.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley warily described the Rostenkowski
plan as very important and interesting. But he isn't going to risk
leading Democrats into tax increases Bush could block and blame on
them.
   The president said he was prepared to negotiate on the
Rostenkowski proposal although he opposes some of its features,
especially the tax boosts and a year's freeze on cost of living
increases in Social Security.
   At the start of the congressional session, Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., proposed a cut in Social Security taxes that
would give wave earners an election-year break while drawing down
the trust fund reserves that mask the true size of the federal
deficit.
   ``If we can't get behind an issue like this ... I'm not sure who
needs the Democratic Party,'' Moynihan said as his proposal faded
for lack of party support. That one clearly worried the White
House, since the Democrats could have used it to force him into
vetoing an election-year tax cut. Bush called it a subterfuge for a
later tax increase and said it would put future social security
benefits at risk.
   Early this month, Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., the House
majority leader, combined a call for increased aid to Eastern
Europe and direct aid to the Soviet Union with a denunciation of
Bush for what he said was a lack of vision and leadership.
   The White House counterattacked with ridicule. ``I don't want to
knock the man,'' Bush said last week. ``Maybe he'll come up with a
good idea one of these days.''
   Gephardt's aid proposal was swallowed in the political
controversy.
   Praising all three idea men, Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., told
the House last week that ``they are driving the White House and the
Republicans crazy.''
   ``It is the U.S. Congress that is more often than not providing
the leadership in today's government,'' he claimed.
   Or talking about it. Leadership takes more than proposals and
speeches, it takes action, even if that involves a political risk.
   The Rostenkowski plan does. The Illinois Democrat, chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee, said it asks ``for modest
sacrifices by all Americans'' to balance the budget beginning in
1993. And each party would have to sacrifice some pet planks in its
political platform. Should either balk, the compromise would
collapse and budget stalemates would persist.
   Rostenkowski proposes a real freeze on federal spending for one
year, including cost-of-living increases in Social Security, a 3
percent cut in military spending with the savings to go into
deficit reduction and not new programs, an increase in top bracket
income taxes and in oil and other consumption taxes.
   The tradeoffs would require each party to yield some pet issues,
with Democrats dropping their refrain that Republicans are a threat
to Social Security benefits, and with the GOP dropping its
tax-and-spend charges against the Democrats.
   For the Rostenkowski package to get anywhere, the blame would
have to be shared. That would take a level of trust that isn't
showing now. Democrats are leery, seeing the ingredients of a setup
in which the White House would negotiate on the plan, then reject a
tax increase and accuse them, again, of being the tax-and-spend
party.
   Foley said Bush must back off his no-new-taxes pledge in advance
of any deal. ``The president has an absolute veto on this
question,'' he said.
   Gephardt and Rostenkowski both said Bush ought to be willing to
risk some of his political capital to take the lead in dealing with
budget and deficit stalemates.
   ``I don't live by the polls,'' Bush replied.
   He questioned whether there was all that much popularity to be
spent anyhow. ``I don't believe in it, is one thing,'' he said at a
news conference. ``I don't believe in polls that much. ... These
things come and go.''

   It comes to this. If Mikhail Gorbachev's thinking prevails,
history will belong to the accountants.
   The Soviet Union took little Lithuania illegally half a century
ago. Now, says the Soviet president, if Lithuania secedes, it will
owe Mother Russia $33 billion in hard currency, mostly to pay for
capital investment. That's like the warden dunning a departing
prisoner for back rent.
   Leaving out interest compounded over 125 years, wouldn't the
same logic entitle the government in Washington to demand billions
from Mississippi, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas,
South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and Arkansas
for their four years of secession? South Carolina has yet to pay a
nickel for the holes it ripped in Fort Sumter.
   If Gorbachev is right, doesn't it follow that Zaire owes Belgium
a bundle for all the time it was the Belgian Congo? In fact, won't
most of Africa be forever in the debt of most of Europe for taking
the trouble to colonize the continent?
   And, finally, would the heirs of the late King George III begin
to get ideas about those impudent 13 colonies that left his bed and
board 200 years ago?
   The possibilities boggle, and that goes with the changing
territory these days.
   Years in costly research, the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane was
retired because of budget cuts. On its last flight, it smashed all
coast-to-coast records flying from California to Washington in 68
minutes, 17 seconds, which is faster than many commuters on both
coasts can make it from home to office.
   Two old soul mates, whose palship once brought the world to the
edge of nuclear war, now keep moving further apart.
   Fidel Castro complained that the Kremlin was undercutting world
communism by ``slandering socialism, destroying its values,
discrediting the party and liquidating its leading role, doing away
with social discipline and sowing chaos and anarchy everywhere.''
   The Moscow News counterattacked: ``Cuban women are in no danger
of replacing revolutionary consciousness with mercenary spirit as
long as they are allowed a choice of one bra or two pairs of
underwear (but not both, and only the size available at the moment).
   ``The administrative and economic model Cuba copied was ours,
imitated at a time when European socialism was drowning in a bog of
stagnation.''
   Translation: Just because you were dumb enough to copy us is no
reason we should stick to a sinking ship.
   For days people wondered what a joint session of Congress was
applauding when it heard President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia
say: ``Consciousness precedes being and not the other way around,
as the Marxists claim.''
   The air was finally cleared by letters to the editor of the
Washington Post from seasoned students of government:
   ``It was quite obvious to me that Havel was saying, `Hopefully,
the parameters of being are impacted subsequent to consciousness.
Basically, the infrastructure of the two will result in a
meaningful relationship in the ongoing preplanning based on past
experience.'''
   And:
   ``I have it on good authority that what Congress thought it
heard when Havel said `consciousness precedes being' was
`Confucious precedes Beijing.'''
   And:
   ``Congress was obviously itching to break for lunch when it
applauded so hard upon hearing Havel proclaim that `nacho chips
precede beans.'''
   And in these unpredictable times, the fathers of June brides
were forewarned by the New York Times that caterers, dress makers
and florists can sue and collect for late cancellations.''

<HEAD>Mild Winter Could Mean Drought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This year's mild winter could come back to
haunt Americans in the form of a drought, the National Weather
Service said Thursday.
   The March hydrological outlook, usually an annual report on
potential for spring flooding from snowmelt, this year is more a
chronicle of missing snow and dry soil conditions.
   Unless heavy precipitation occurs, the return of drought to
major areas of the nation is imminent, the report said.
   Drought plagued much of the nation in the hot summer of 1988,
easing somewhat last year. Pockets of dryness have persisted,
however.
   Serious water-supply problems are a distinct possibility for
much of California as well as in the Great Basin, lower Colorado,
parts of the Rio Grande and in western and southern Texas, the
weather service reported.
   Low stream flow, low soil moisture and low spring flood
potential also cover a large area of the north central states, the
report said.
   Parts of many central and western states have experienced
abnormally dry conditions for two to four years, resulting on dry
conditions deep in the soil.
   The threat of snowmelt flooding, meanwhile, is limited to small
areas of the country.
   Flood threat is above normal in a strip of northwestern Montana
and northeastern Idaho.
   But snow cover in the eastern two-thirds of the country is
minimal and where there is snow it is below average, except in
northern Maine and northern Michigan. Some portions of the central
states have reported high streamflows.
   A notable exception to the dry conditions is in south-central
Alaska, which has had a record snowfall. The melt there is still
weeks away, but that is a region where ice jams have created flood
danger in the past.

   What's in a name?
   For Donald Trump, an awful lot. The developer has wrapped
moniker and business empire so closely they have become one big,
glitzy package of Trump this, Trump that. But his recent marriage
problems show how building a business on a name can be risky if the
name becomes the object of ridicule.
   The name Trump, a symbol of the big-spending 1980s, is
synonymous with conspicuous wealth. High rollers play in his Trump
Castle and Trump Plaza casinos in Atlantic City, N.J.; urban
sophisticates live in $4 million condos in Trump Palace or Trump
Parc in Manhattan; executives fly the Trump Shuttle between New
York, Boston or Washington.
   The late publishing tycoon Malcolm Forbes and cable television
titan Ted Turner also built namesake empires around their own star
quality. But perhaps more than anyone, Trump's personality and
business have kept his face in front of the cameras and his name in
front of the public.
   Trump ``has done a magnificent job of building himself up,''
said Jack Trout, president of Trout &amp; Ries, a marketing consulting
firm in Greenwich, Conn. ``Unfortunately, when you live by the
press, you can die by the press.''
   Trump normally basks in media attention but has said he hates
the splashy publicity about his breakup with wife and business
partner Ivana. Even so, he insists that his business has benefited
from the screaming tabloid headlines, an assertion that some Trump
critics find even more repulsive.
   ``There's something demeaning and vile about his trumpeting that
his marital situation is adding to his business,'' former New York
mayor Edward I. Koch _ a longtime Trump antagonist _ said in a
telephone interview. ``To me, it's incredible that he would
denigrate Ivana Trump.''
   Some believe the publicity swirling around Ivana, Donald and
alleged mistress Marla Maples has hurt Trump's business.
   ``He's becoming a joke,'' Trout said. ``For a serious brand,
that can be a big problem.''
   ``You have to handle yourself extremely well, because you are
putting yourself as a person front and center,'' the consultant
said. ``You've got to be very careful with your reputation ... You
can't do stupid things.''
   Forbes, on the other hand, was careful and consistent about his
image, Trout said. His divorce from wife Roberta, for example,
occurred quietly.
   Forbes's sons, of course, face another kind of famous-name
challenge as a result of his death last month at age 70. They must
run the publishing empire they have inherited without the man who
gave it character.
   Eldest son Malcolm Jr., known as Steve, is a bookish fellow who
admits that he can't exactly follow in his father's madcap
footsteps. ``I am certainly not going to try to imitate him,'' he
told the Wall Street Journal in a recent interview. ``He would be
disappointed if I tried to.''
   While the late Forbes had a passion for motorcycling, hot air
balloons and partying, bashful Steve, 43, collects presidential
papers and manuscripts. Rather than clip his wings as Trump is
advised to do by critics, Steve Forbes may need to let loose a
little.
   Turner, head of a $600 million cable TV empire, seems already to
have learned the lesson of handling a personal name-brand carefully.
   ``Is he a flamboyant character? Yes. He's had a very checkered
career,'' said Gordon Crawford, an analyst with Capital Research
Co. in Los Angeles who follows Turner's companies. ``He's also
created the most valuable group of cable properties in the world.''
   Turner, who successfully piloted his yacht to the America's Cup
in 1977, has been called ``Captain Outrageous'' and the ``Mouth of
the South.'' Between 1986 and 1987, he plunged his business $1.4
billion into debt, lost another $25 million on the Goodwill Games,
separated from his wife and lost his house in a fire.
   Some say Turner seems to have mellowed, although his reference
last year to abortion foes as ``idiots'' and ``Bozos'' drew wide
publicity, as well as the ire of pro-lifers.
   ``He's becoming Mr. Corporate Statesperson; he's mellowing
out,'' Trout said, noting that Turner's demeanor is now
considerably less brash.

<HEAD>OPEC Ministers to Review Oil Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC ministers began gathering Thursday
to review current oil market conditions and decide whether to
revise the group's price and production policies.
   Ministers from Libya, Venezuela, Ecuador and Kuwait were among
the early arrivals for Friday's meeting of a special panel of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   In advance of the talks, analysts predicted the ministers of the
13 oil-producing nations would not revise the price and supply
guidelines set late last year.
   Ecuador's oil minister, Diego Tamariz, said, ``We will analyze
the situation of the market and on that basis decide what to do in
the second quarter of the year.''
   He said the officials would study projections for demand and
supply of OPEC crude oil in the April-June period before adjusting
the production ceiling. Whether they change it or not, he said,
``all depends on the outcome of the analysis.''
   Last November, the ministers set a production limit of about 22
million barrels of crude a day for the first six months of the
year. It had been fixed at 20.5 million barrels in the last quarter
of 1989.
   But several OPEC countries, led by Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates, are together pumping at least a million barrels a day
above the cap, according to analysts.
   Despite surging production, prices have remained above the
cartel's target of $18 a barrel due to strong worldwide demand and
declining production by the United States and other non-OPEC
producers.
   Prices are expected to soften along with demand in coming
months, however, as temperatures warm in the United States and
other major consuming countries.
   In recent weeks, several ministers have privately pressed for
changes in the cartel's price and production targets. But they
appeared to have drawn little support from others.
   Iraq's minister, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, was reportedly
anxious to have a higher reference price.
   Kuwait's Ali Khalifa al-Sabah suggested in the Middle East
Economic Survey that the quota system should be scrapped. He said
it was unrealistic and often ignored by members.
   But, when asked in Vienna whether his idea would get much
attention, he quipped, ``No, we need our security blanket.''
   The formula used by the cartel starts with an overall output
ceiling then each country is allotted a quota based largely on
capacity. Without a quota, each member could produce freely.
   Sabah was quoted recently as saying his country did not have to
go along with a quota when prices were above the $18 mark.
   Tamariz, asked about the overproduction, said OPEC needed to
look at the different needs of its members. ``There has to be some
room for flexibility,'' he said.
   Formal talks by OPEC's monitoring committee are scheduled to
begin Friday evening. Only eight ministers are officially members
of the panel, but all 13 OPEC ministers are expected to attend.
   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said
Thursday he does not believe the recent rise in the value of the
dollar will adversely affect the nation's trade deficit this year.
   ``I hear a lot of talk about the dollar climbing,'' he told
reporters after a speech to the National Newspaper Association.
``But if you go back over the last year and a half and look at it
over that period of time, what you'll see is stability _ some days
up, some days down.
   ``But you just go back and look at it since the beginning of
1988, you'll find we've had a stable dollar and that's what we've
tried to achieve,'' he continued. ``We've had stability and
stablility is what we strive for in all markets, markets that
people can rely on.''
   A stronger dollar could cause the nation's trade deficit to
widen because it would make imported goods cheaper while increasing
the price of U.S. products sold overseas.
   The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the gap in the
current account balance, the broadest measure of U.S. trade,
narrowed to $105.9 billion last year, a 16 percent reduction from
1988.
   The reduction was due in part to an improvement in the balance
of trade in the fourth quarter that came largely from a decline in
the vaue of the dollar. The dollar has been strengthening in recent
weeks, however.
   In his speech to the newspaper association, Brady renewed his
call for a single market linking trades of stocks, stock options
and stock index futures.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission now has jurisdiction over
stocks and stock options, while the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission is responsible for markets handling stock index futures.
   ``The sharp stock market decline of October 1987,'' he said,
``demonstrated dramatically how these markets, all operating by
their own sets of rules, can interact to stimulate excessive
volatility and reinforce the downward spiral.''
   Brady noted that most overseas markets place regulation of all
three in the hands of one regualator and said U.S. markets also
could benefit greatly by ending the fragmented control.
   Without endorsing any approach, Brady mentioned three ways of
achieving unified control. They were to merge the SEC and CFTC,
give the SEC jurisdiction over all futures except those related to
tangible commodities or shift stock index futures alone to the SEC.
   ``Many have recommended full merger as the most straightforward
and the course chosen by countries abroad,'' he said. ``There are
perhaps arguments in favor of the other approaches as well. What's
important is that we get something done, and get it done now.''

   Volume amounted to 348.7 million shares, compared with 382.1
million shares Wednesday.
   ``The market feels okay but there are few buyers and even fewer
sellers,'' said one dealer. ``We've been in a 50-point trading
range for quite some time with no indication that we're actually
going anywhere.''
   Dealers said trading was quiet because many investors were
waiting for Tuesday's release of Britain's budget.

   Interco Corp. was a manufacturing and retailing
conglomerate in 1988, turning out well-known brands of clothes,
shoes and furniture and taking in more than $3 billion in sales a
year.
   Today the company is a shadow of its former self, saddled with
debts following a $2.8 billion recapitalization. The company is
trying to cut deals with bankers while seeking buyers for its
assets.
   Doskocil Cos., a food processor that took over the larger Wilson
Foods Corp. in 1988, filed recently for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law.
   Doskocil bought Wilson for $133 million, assumed millions of
dollars in Wilson's debts, then defaulted on a loan. The company,
like Interco, has had trouble selling assets, and its
lower-than-expected income hasn't been enough to pay bills.
   These companies aren't as well known as investment firm Drexel
Burnham Lambert or retailer Campeau Corp., both forced into
bankruptcy court recently by credit problems. They are nonetheless
casualties of the debt-dominated 1980s.
   Interco once made a broad array of products ranging from
Converse sneakers to Ethan Allen dining sets. It did not go into
debt by choice but rather to thwart a hostile takeover by a pair of
unfriendly Washington investors.
   The company borrowed $2 billion to pay shareholders a special
dividend and expected to foot the bill partly through asset sales.
   But Interco also expected business to be stronger than it turned
out to be. Although divisions like Ethan Allen went fast, it hasn't
been easy to sell some of its other businesses that are still on
the block.
   Like most companies, Interco also did not anticipate the
collapse of the junk bond market last year and the new caution
toward acquisitions that followed.
   That caution has made banks more reluctant to lend money and
would-be acquirers more hesitant about taking on new debt to buy
other businesses. This has left companies like Interco strapped
because they need cash.
   Robert Raiff, who follows Interco for C.J. Lawrence, Morgan
Grenfell Inc., blames the company's lack of foresight for its
problems.
   ``They're in a position that long-term won't allow them to
operate without a very major restructuring of the debt,'' Raiff
said.
   Interco wants to retain its Converse and Florsheim footwear
manufacturers and Broyhill and Lane furniture companies as core
businesses.
   The company recently persuaded lenders to relax the terms of a
$244.5 million bridge loan payment. But even when that payment is
made _ it is due in May _ Interco still will have a heavy debt
burden.
   Doskocil's story is a case of a company going too heavily into
debt to take over another company, then getting socked for higher
raw materials prices _ in Doskocil's case, hogs _ and a tighter
availability of credit.
   The company went $240 million into debt to buy Wilson Foods,
expecting to repay part of that by selling assets. But like
Interco, Doskocil has found it is no longer easy to find buyers,
especially buyers who can get financing.
   The company recently reported assets of $474.1 million and
liabilities of $414.1 million. Under Chapter 11, it has bought time
to reorganize and try to stay in business.

   In another move to scale back operations,
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. agreed Thursday to sell its mutual fund
and individual investment services division to Salomon Inc. for $28
million.
   The sale of Lehman Management Co., which has about $2.6 billion
of assets under management, will more than double the size of
Salomon's money management operation. Salomon spokeswoman Macy W.
Egerton said the firm now manages $2.2 billion.
   Lehman Management, known on Wall Street as Lemco, manages five
equity mutual funds and more than 550 accounts for institutions and
wealthy individuals.
   Shearson is expected to leave several business lines this year
as part of an overhaul under parent American Express Co. Shearson
is laying off 2,000 employees this month and has said it will focus
on its core retail brokerage, investment banking, capital markets
and asset management.
   The sale completes a dismantling of Lemco. Last August, Lemco
sold its institutional money management business to a group of
Shearson managers for $100 million. Shearson took a 10 percent
stake in the new company, Lehman-Ark Management Co., which had $14
billion in assets under management.
   After the sale, Lemco was changed from a wholly owned Shearson
subsidiary into a division of the firm.
   Shearson officials said the firm wanted to integrate the
remaining parts of Lemco into its $93 billion money management
businesses, but had difficulty doing so. Discussions on selling the
unit began last November, they said.
   ``Shearson's overall commitment to its asset management business
remains unchanged,'' spokesman Steven Faigen said. He said the sale
was ``in line with the overall strategic focus'' in restructuring
Shearson.
   Almost all of the 45 investment and research professionals and
other employees of Lehman Management will become employees of
Salomon Brothers Asset Management, the companies said.
   ``We are delighted to have the talented and experienced
investment staff of Lehman Management join us,'' John H. Gutfreund,
Salomon Inc.'s chairman and chief executive officer, said in a
statement.
   After the deal is completed, the names of Lehman Corp., Lehman
Investors Fund Inc., Lehman Capital Fund Inc., and Lehman
Opportunity Fund Inc. will be changed to Salomon Brothers Fund
Inc., Salomon Brothers Investment Fund Inc., Salomon Brothers
Capital Fund Inc., and Salomon Brothers Opportunity Fund Inc.,
respectively.
   Salomon Brothers Asset Management, the subsidiary acquiring the
Shearson unit, also will act as an investment adviser to the fifth
company, SLH Growth and Opportunity Portfolio, which will remain
part of the SLH Equity Portfolio.
   Shearson said assets in the funds total about $1.7 billion,
while those in the institutional and individual accounts total $869
million.
   The acquisition must be approved by the boards of directors and
shareholders of the five investment companies, the firms said.

   The stock market managed a moderate advance
today in what brokers described as a wary atmosphere on Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.64 to 2,702.48
by 2 p.m. in New York.
   Gainers outnumbered outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
730 up, 642 down and 504 unchanged.
   Much of the financial world's attention was focused on Friday,
when the markets have a date with the quarterly ``triple witching
hour'' involving a set of expiring options and futures on stock
indexes.
   The witching hour has acquired a reputation for unpredictable
turbulence, which tends to discourage traders from taking positions
before it happens.
   Also on the agenda for Friday are several reports from the
government on the state of the economy, including industrial
production and the producer price index of finished goods for
February.
   Brokers said investors seemed fairly confident that the data
would support recent hopes that the economy could recover from its
recent slowdown without having to undergo a full-scale recession.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose } to 107; General Electric { to 63{; American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph { to 41{, and Philip Morris &lsqb; to 38.
   Glaxo Holdings, which posted a 27 percent increase in pretx
profits for the six months through Dec. 31, rose ~ to 24~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.56 to 186.24. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .27 at 361.64.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 101.92 million shares with two

<HEAD>Commerce Secretary Disappointed At Lack of Progress In Trade Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANICE FUHRMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Failure by the United States and Japan to act soon
to eliminate trade barriers and strengthen their economies raises
dangers to the entire global trading system, U.S. Secretary of
Commerce Robert Mosbacher said Thursday.
   ``If we do not act soon, we may throw away our last chance to
save the world trading system from serious damage,'' Mosbacher told
reporters at the Japan National Press Club.
   The two countries are negotiating greater market access in Japan
for U.S. satellites, lumber and supercomputers, and the elimination
of structural impediments to balanced trade in both nations.
   As Mosbacher described a ``sense of urgency'' in ongoing trade
talks between the two countries, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and
other government leaders appeared ready to propose changes in
Japan's economic structure that could reduce Japan's $49 billion
trade surplus with the United States.
   Local news reports said Kaifu held an emergency meeting late
Wednesday with three key Cabinet ministers and set a weekend
deadline for detailed measures for removing structural trade
barriers.
   Mosbacher was dispatched to Tokyo by President George Bush to
follow up on Bush's meeting with Kaifu in Palm Springs, California,
earlier in the month.
   In another sticky trade issue, U.S. rice growers brought their
campaign to open Japan's rice market to Tokyo. But a government
agency ordered the removal of a small amount of U.S. rice displayed
at an international food exhibition in Chiba, southwest of Tokyo.
   Food Agency officials said the display violated the Food Control
Law, which prohibits rice imports for sale in Japan. Japan has said
it needs to maintain self-sufficiency in rice to protect food
security.
   Mosbacher told reporters he was ``extremely disappointed'' that
satellite negotiations ended Tuesday in Washington without major
progress. ``It is critical that we resolve this,'' he said.
   The United States, a world leader in satellites technology,
wants Japan to purchase U.S. satellites. Japan says it wants to
nurture its fledgling satellite industry.
   ``It's hard to believe this great nation, which produces so many
goods so well, has to protect an infant industry,'' Mosbacher said.
   In addition to reducing barriers to specific products, the
United States is urging Japan to undertake structural economic
reforms, such as deregulation of its retail distribution system,
reduction of land prices, and increases in public works spending.
   The United States, as part of an ``eight-point agenda for
competitiveness,'' has pledged to boost research and development
funds, reform its education system, reduce its budget deficit, and
reform antitrust and product liability regulations.
   While noting progress in shrinking the U.S. trade deficits with
other countries and in reducing the U.S. budget deficit, Mosbacher
said ``Japan's overall trade surplus with America _ and the world _
has achieved a semi-permanent status.''
   Mosbacher also was to host a meeting of five major Japanese
semiconductor users to encourage them to increase their purchases
of U.S. computer chips. U.S. makers have a 12.9 percent share of
the Japanese market but are aiming at a 20 percent share.
   In speeches Thursday, Mosbacher said Japan was obligated to
boost the U.S. share of the market to 20 percent by 1991, under a
1986 agreement between the two nations.
   Japanese government officials and producers maintain such a
promise could not be assured in a free-market economy and that in
the agreement Japan merely recognized the U.S. desire to reach a 20
percent share.
   During his four-day visit to Tokyo, Mosbacher also met with
Kaifu, Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, Trade Minister Kabun Muto
and officials of the country's top business group, the Federation
of Economic Organizations, or Keidanren.

<HEAD>Venezuela To Announce Debt Pact, Finance Minister Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIA TEJERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venezuela is expected to announce
Friday an agreement with creditor banks to reduce by up to 30
percent of its public-sector foreign debt, Finance Minister Roberto
Pocaterra said.
   Pocaterra said late Wednesday that after a year of negotiations,
the agreement will ``very possibly'' be Friday despite President
Carlos Andres Perez's absence from the country.
   Perez is in Brasil, attending the inauguration of Fernando
Collor de Mello.
   ``The reduction should be between 25- and 30 percent, almost
double what Mexico got,'' said Pocaterra.
   The agreement would affect the $20.5 billion public-sector
restructured debt. Venezuela's overall foreign debt totals $37
billion, the fourth largest in Latin America.
   Until now, banks had been unenthusiastic about reducing
Venezuela's debt, pointing to its oil income as a sign of its
ability to pay.
   Oil exports, which account for more that 90 percent of
Venezuela's foreign exchange earnings, are expected to top $10
billion this year, compared to last year's $9.49 billion.
   Venezuela suspended capital payments last year, and is behind on
interest installments.
   According to a government report, Venezuela expects to reduce
its public debt by $11.2 billion by 1992. It has already signed up
credits through 1993 amounting to $12.8 billion to finance its debt
reduction plan.
   The report said Venezuela had presented the following options to
the bank advisory commitee in New York, which represents 460
creditor banks: direct debt repurchase, with a 60 percent discount;
two types of zero coupon bonds, including one with a 35 percent
discount on debt face value; and new loans.
   Once an agreement is announced, banks will have four months to
choose among the alternatives.
   In February, Mexico signed an agreement that cut its $48.5
billion debt to commercial banks by some $7 billion. Banks were
given three options: reduce debt capital by 35 percent, cut
interest rate to a fixed 6.25 percent or offer new loans equivalent
to 25 percent of their outsanding loans to Mexico.
   About 40 percent of creditor banks opted for capital reduction,
50 percent chose interest rate reduction, and the remaining 10
percent granted new loans.

   A luxury train that pampers riders with
seven-course meals and live entertainment is adding New York and
Philadelphia to its schedule, operators of the American-European
Express said Thursday.
   The Chicago-based company, which initiated thrice-weekly service
between Chicago and Washington in November, also announced package
deals with United Airlines and several hotels.
   And it said it plans to develop an even more exclusive
``executive'' class representing ``the finest environment that
railroading has ever seen.''
   American-European Express Inc. will begin twice-weekly service
between Chicago and New York with a stop in Philadelphia on May 3,
its president, William F. Spann, said in a statement.
   One-way fares between Chicago and New York will range from $517
to $775, depending on the size of the cabin, the company said.
One-way fares between Chicago and Philadelphia will run from $492
to $750, the same as on the Chicago-Washington route.
   The package deals allow travelers to take the train one way,
stay overnight at a luxury hotel and fly back on United Airlines at
reduced rates.
   Each American-European Express train consists of three sleeper
cars, a dining car and a club car that are connected to Amtrak
passenger trains.
   Spann said the company was buying another sleeper car, diner car
and an observation car for each of its trains to create the new
executive class.

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veteran Maytag Corp. executive Leonard
Hadley on Thursday was named to the newly created position of chief
operating officer of the international appliance maker, a promotion
that makes him a likely eventual successor for Maytag's chairman,
Daniel Krumm.
   ``By creating this position, we are strengthening our management
structure for the future,'' Krumm said. ``Len's appointment to his
new post is a reflection of not only his considerable achievements,
but of the confidence we have in him as Maytag moves into the
decade of the '90s.''
   Albert Taylor, a securities analyst who follows Maytag for the
Chicago firm Duff &amp; Phelps, said the appointment was no surprise.
   ``Hadley has been a longtime Maytag man and has a good
reputation at the company,'' Taylor said. ``It also sets the stage
for Hadley to be the likely successor for Dan Krumm.''
   Krumm will turn 64 later this year. Hadley is 55.
   Maytag, based in the central Iowa community of Newton, expanded
last year with the acquisition of the Hoover line of floor care
products, and reported earnings of $131.5 million on sales of $3.09
billion in 1989.
   But the international expansion has created problems for the
company, which had a 24.3 percent slide in its fourth-quarter 1989
profit as a result of sluggish British sales and high interest
payments on its takeover debt.
   Hadley was executive vice president for Maytag and president of
its appliance group, which includes Admiral, Hardwick, Jenn-Air,
Magic Chef, Maytag and Norge brands.
   Hadley will continue to oversee North American appliance
operations, including the Maycor appliance parts and service
subsidiary. He also will assume responsibility for the Dixie-Narco
group, which specializes in soft drink vending equipment and
supplies leading syrup companies at home and abroad.
   Frank Vaughn, an executive vice president who reports to Krumm,
continues to head Maytag's Hoover group.
   Hadley has been an executive vice president since February 1989
and was named head of the appliance group last June.
   The native of Earlham holds an accounting degree from the
University of Iowa and joined Maytag as a cost accountant in 1959.
He has been a member of the board of directors since 1985.

<TEXT>
   The management of Saks Fifth Avenue, in
partnership with a Japanese retailer, has offered to buy the
upscale department store chain from its London-based parent BAT
Industries PLC, it was announced Thursday.
   Terms of the proposal were not disclosed. Saks management said
in a news release that the joint bid with Tobu Department Store Co.
Ltd. was fully financed and spokesman Peter Rosenthal would not
elaborate.
   Arthur Martinez, a senior American executive of BAT, said in an
interview that the offer is one of several that have been submitted
for Saks. He declined to identify the other bidders or disclose
amounts offered.
   But he said the company is pleased with the quantity and quality
of the proposals. The initial bids are being reviewed and the list
of suitors will be shortened. General Cinema Corp., owner of The
Neiman Marcus Group of stores, previously has been reported as a
bidder.
   Final bids will emerge in late April or early May, said
Martinez, senior vice president in charge of retail operations for
BATUS Inc., BAT's U.S. holding company.
   Retail industry analysts have said the 46 Saks specialty
department stores would fetch a price roughly equal to the chain's
annual sales, which totaled about $1.3 billion in 1989. In the view
of many analysts, Saks is the most desirable retail property on the
market today.
   Saks is one of several holdings, including Marshall Field &amp; Co.,
that BAT put up for sale last year to try to thwart Sir James
Goldsmith's hostile $22 billion takeover bid for the British
conglomerate.
   The Saks management buyout plan envisions a global expansion of
Saks, which specializes in higher priced designer and ready-to-wear
apparel and caters to affluent customers.
   Current management would oversee operations in the United States
while Tokyo-based Tobu would expand Saks in Asia. Eventual
expansion into Europe also is planned.
   Melvin Jacobs, chairman of New York-based Saks, said the idea of
branching out overseas has been under consideration for some time.
   ``Our arrangements with Tobu fulfill the potential for Asia. We
believe that the strategic partnership which we have formed with
Tobu will ensure management's continued attention to serving the
needs of the U.S. consumer while providing an opportunity to expand
Saks into Asia,'' Jacobs said.
   He said Saks management also intends to ``forge a similar
strategic alliance for Europe.''
   Makoto Nezu, executive vice president of Tobu, said, ``As
America's leading luxury store, Saks is in a class by itself, and
for some time we have been discussing the possibility of working
together outside the United States.''
   Tobu, part of a big Japanese conglomerate, is in the midst of a
major expansion, including work on a new flagship store in the
north of Tokyo. If the joint bid succeeds, a substantial portion of
the new store will be used to introduce Saks to Japanese shoppers.
   Saks, founded in 1924 and bought by BAT in 1973, operates 46
stores in 20 states and employs about 12,000 people. Its flagship
store, which is being expanded, is located on Fifth Avenue in
mid-town Manhattan.
   Additional Saks stores will be opened in Denver in August and in
Portland, Ore., in September. A new store in Chicago, to replace
the one there since 1929, will be opened later this year.
   BAT, with interests in tobacco, retailing, paper, insurance and
other financial services, last year decided to dispose of an
estimated $6.6 billion in assets in an effort to fend off an
unwanted takeover bid from Hoylake Investment Ltd.
   Martinez said several bids also have been submitted for Marshall
Field's and final proposals are expected for that 24-store chain in
the spring.
   Final offers already are in for BAT's Breuners, a West Coast
furniture and home furnishings chain, Martinez said. Final
proposals are expected shortly for Ivey's, a regional department
store chain mostly in the South.
   The proposed takeover of BAT by Hoylake, a group led by the
Anglo-French financier Goldsmith, has been under scrutiny by
British and American regulators.
   U.S. state insurance regulators are looking at the proposed deal
closely because of BAT's ownership of Farmers Insurance Group Inc.
of Los Angeles.
   The bid has been suspended pending the outcome of the
regulators' review.

<HEAD>BAT Reports Progress in Defensive Strategy Against Goldsmith Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BAT Industries PLC reported progress Thursday in
its defensive strategy against a hostile bid, saying the sales of
its U.S. stores should be completed by June and announcing the
terms for the spinoff of a large British retailer.
   There has been some concern that the British conglomerate would
have trouble selling its retailing businesses in the United States
because several other major retailers are on the auction block.
   The $22 billion hostile bid for BAT by Hoylake Investments Ltd.,
an investment group headed by the Anglo-French financier Sir James
Goldsmith, has been suspended pending the outcome of a review by
U.S. insurance regulators, expected in the coming months.
   The U.S. regulators are seeking to determine what impact a
change of ownership would have on BAT's Farmers Insurance Group
Inc. of Los Angeles.
   BAT's defensive strategy, announced in September, is aimed at
enhancing the value of its shares through a major restructuring.
   The restructuring involves selling off its U.S. retailing
businesses, spinning off its Argos retailing business in Britain,
combining its British and American paper companies and spinning
them off as well, and buying back up to 10 percent of its stock.
   The company intends to focus on its remaining tobacco and
financial services operations.
   If given the regulatory green light, the Goldsmith group is
expected to bid again for BAT, and may even pursue a takeover of
what is left of the conglomerate after BAT completes its defensive
restructuring.
   BAT's shares were unchanged at the equivalent of $12.94 apiece
on London's Stock Exchange Thursday. Hoylake's suspended offer came
to $13.69 a share.
   BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy said the group's restructuring
plans, which include the disposal of its U.S. department stores,
are ``proceeding well'' and should be completed by June.
   Management of BAT's Saks Fifth Avenue on Thursday announced a
buyout offer for the 46 upscale department stores had been
submitted.
   The Saks management bid, made jointly with a Japanese retailing
company, was one of several proposals received. General Cinema
Corp. of the United States also has identified itself as a bidder,
said a BAT spokesman in London, who declined to be identified. He
said other bidders were confidential as were the amounts of the
offers.
   BAT also has received bids for its other U.S. department stores,
including the Chicago-based Marshall Field's stores, the spokesman
said.
   BAT said it would turn Argos, the British toy, jewelry and
electronics retailer, into an independent, publicly held company by
giving existing BAT shareholders one new Argos share for every five
BAT shares they hold.
   Trading in the new Argos shares is scheduled to begin April 6,
pending approval of the move by shareholders at an April 5 meeting,
BAT said.
   Argos, with 254 outlets, had after-tax profit of $99 million in
1988, the most recent year for which information is available, on
sales of $1.2 billion.
   BAT said it would announce in mid-May the terms for the spinoff
of the combination of its paper businesses, Appleton of the United
States and Wiggins Teape of Britain.

<HEAD>Specialty Department Store Chain Founded in 1924</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saks Fifth Avenue's management and Japan's Tobu
Department Store Co. Ltd. Thursday said they submitted a joint
buyout proposal for the 46-store chain.
   Here is a brief history of Saks:
   _ Saks was the brainchild of Horace Saks and Bernard Gimbel, who
independently operated stores in New York City in the early part of
this century. The two merchants decided to open a fashionable
specialty department store catering to the carriage trade. The
store on Fifth Avenue opened Sept. 15, 1924.
   _ From 1924 to 1969, Saks expanded and built a national
recognition as an upscale retailer, mainly of fashionable apparel.
   _ Bernard Gimbel's cousin, Adam, became president after the
sudden death of Horace Saks in 1926. Under Adam Gimbel, branch
stores were opened and the flagship Manhattan store was redecorated
in the opulent Art Moderne style from the 1925 Paris Exposition.
   _ Adam Gimbel retired as Saks president in 1969. At the time,
there were 21 Saks stores.
   _ Saks in 1973 was bought by BATUS Inc., the U.S. holding
company of the London-based conglomerate BAT Indusries PLC.
   _ Under BAT's ownership Saks has grown to include 46 stores,
operating in 33 markets in 20 states. States in which there are
Saks stores include Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida,
Georgia, Illinois, Louisana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia.
   _ The flagship Fifth Avenue store was proclaimed a New York City
landmark in 1985.
   _ BAT announced in September 1989 plans to sell Saks, its other
retailing operations plus certain other assets as part of a
strategy to thwart an unsolicited takeover attempt by an investment
group led by the Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith. The
$22 billion bid for BAT has been suspended pending the outcome of a
review by U.S. insurance regulatory agencies, expected in the
coming months.
   _ Saks management announced March 15, 1990 that it has submitted
a bid for the chain. The buyout proposal was made jointly with Tobu
Department Store Co. Ltd. of Japan. Terms were not disclosed.
   _ BAT confirmed on March 15 that the management buyout plan is
one of several bids submitted for Saks. General Cinema Corp., owner
of the Neiman Marcus group of stores, previously has identified
itself as a bidder. Final bids are expected by late April or early
May, BAT said.

   The stock market pushed ahead gradually today in
what brokers described as a wary atmosphere on Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 13.29 to 2,701.13
by 3 p.m. in New York.
   Gainers outnumbered outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
779 up, 607 down and 498 unchanged.
   Much of the financial world's attention was focused on Friday,
when the markets have a date with the quarterly ``triple witching
hour'' involving a set of expiring options and futures on stock
indexes.
   The witching hour has acquired a reputation for unpredictable
turbulence, which tends to discourage traders from taking positions
before it happens.
   Also on the agenda for Friday are several reports from the
government on the state of the economy, including industrial
production and the producer price index of finished goods for
February.
   Brokers said investors seemed fairly confident that the data
would support recent hopes that the economy could recover from its
recent slowdown without having to undergo a full-scale recession.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose ~ to 107&lsqb;; General Electric { to 63{; American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph | to 41|, and Philip Morris &lsqb; to 38.
   Glaxo Holdings, which posted a 27 percent increase in pretx
profits for the six months through Dec. 31, gained 1 to 25.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.56 to 186.24. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .56 at 361.93.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 120.16 million shares with an
hour to go.

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices posted sharp gains and
grain futures closed moderately higher Thursday on the Chicago
Board of Trade amid talk that the Soviet Union was in the market
for more U.S. grain.
   The late rally in the soybean pit erased much of the losses
registered earlier in the week and prompted speculation that prices
may have to move even higher to persuade farmers to part with their
soybean stocks.
   ``The daily demand is exceeding the daily supply and we really
haven't gotten up to price levels that have stimulated the movement
in supply to meet that,'' said William Biedermann, research
director with the commodities brokerage Allendale Inc.
   Analysts and traders said rumors of Soviet interest in U.S. corn
and soybean meal supported the markets, which had been moving
higher for most of the day after bouncing off their opening lows.
   Speculation that the Brazilian government may impose a new
export tax on soybeans and soybean meal sparked further buying,
they said.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent to 3{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $3.84{ a bushel; corn futures
were { cent to 3\ cents higher with March at $2.47 a bushel; oats
were { cent lower to } cent higher with March at $1.44 a bushel;
and soybeans were 7{ cents to 13{ cents higher with March at $5.86
a bushel.

<HEAD>Continental Announces First Schedule Expansion In Two Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GRACZYK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines on Thursday announced its
first schedule expansion in two years, boosting daily flights by
100 to 1,417 and beginning service to Panama, Costa Rica and
several U.S. cities.
   ``We needed to get our arms around our operational
difficulties,'' Stan Hula, Continental vice president of schedule
development, said of the airline's ``no-growth mode'' in the past
two years. ``We think we've got those problems licked. There are a
number of things coming together for Continental that is causing us
to be able to expand.''
   He pointed to Department of Transportation statistics which
showed customer complaints about Continental were down 96 percent
since 1987 and on-time arrival performance for Continental was the
third best among the nation's airlines in 1989.
   Hula also credited an improvement in Continental's financial
condition for the schedule expansion.
   Although the airline lost $56.1 million in the fourth quarter of
1989, the loss was $43.1 million less than the October-December
period the previous year. For all of 1989, Houston-based
Continental, a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., showed a $3.1 million
profit.
   Twenty-three planes are being added to the Continental fleet,
including jets that were bought from sister carrier Eastern
Airlines and returned to Continental after being leased to Eastern
and Pan Am Corp., Hula said.
   He had no details on fares on the new flights.
   ``There will be some pricing initiatives,'' he said. ``We will
be very competitive throughout the summer with all of our fares.''
   Beginning May 15, Continental will operate flights from Houston
to Panama City, Panama, and San Jose, Costa Rica, giving the
airline the largest number of U.S. flights to Central America, Hula
said. Continental already has flights to Belize, El Salvador,
Guatemala and Honduras.
   ``We look to expand in Central America even further as time
passes,'' Hula said. ``The changing conditions in Panama obviously
make this service possible. The improving political climate has a
great deal to do with our interest in Central America.''
   In the United States, Continental is starting late-night service
out of Houston with a dozen flights leaving at 10:30 p.m.
   ``These flights bridge a gap between evening travel and the
overnight `red-eye' flights,'' he said. ``While 10:30 p.m. may seem
late to many people, we believe there is sufficient demand at this
time of day to warrant the implementation of a new `bank' of
flights.''
   Elsewhere, new service is being added from Cleveland, Ohio, to
Louisville, Ky., and Norfolk, Va. From Newark, N.J., service is
being added to Greensboro, N.C.; Norfolk, Va.; Columbia, S.C.; and
Antigua, West Indies. Those flights start May 1.
   Hula said the additional flights could prompt non-union
Continental to hire nearly 1,000 new workers, including about 200
pilots and 600 flight attendants.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T, Unions Discuss Early Retirement Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T and its unions Thursday discussed plans
to offer early retirement to non-management employees for the first
time in the company's long-running campaign to slim down.
   American Telephone and Telegraph Co. had no details on who would
be affected, how many workers would be eligible and what incentives
would be offered because talks were in an early stage, said company
spokesman Burke Stinson at AT&amp;T's Basking Ridge office.
   Stuart Crane, an analyst for Gruntal &amp; Co., speculated that
fewer than 10,000 people likely would be affected by the expanded
workforce cuts, although it was unknown how many actually would
accept early retirement.
   A spokesman for one of AT&amp;T's major unions, the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said he could not comment on the
substance of the talks.
   However, the idea of offering enhanced pensions to induce
retirements ``is obviously something that we're not opposed to,''
said the spokesman, Tom Hickman.
   The company's other main union, the Communications Workers of
America, said it had no comment.
   The efforts are another step in AT&amp;T's efforts to cut overhead
costs and consolidate its operations, said Stinson.
   AT&amp;T has shrunk its workforce steadily since the 1984 breakup of
the Bell System. The company's workforce has shrunk to 281,400 _
including 173,500 non-management workers _ from 373,000 at the time
of the breakup.
   Last year, a special retirement plan for managers prompted
12,500 to depart out of 35,000 who were eligible, said Stinson. The
arrangement added five years to each manager's age and tenure, and
boosted pension payments by 15 percent for five years, or until a
retired worker reached 65.
   A total of 25,000 jobs were cut last year, some through
attrition.
   As AT&amp;T transforms its network into a computer-driven system and
employs new digital and solid state technology, it has increasing
numbers of workers with less to do, said Stinson.
   More switching and operator services are done by computer.
Equipment installation and servicing has become easier with the
addition of high-tech digital equipment.
   ``The AT&amp;T system is one gigantic computer with distributed
intelligence,'' said Crane.
   Also, competition brought by the Bell System breakup forced AT&amp;T
to pare away extra layers of employees, which it could afford when
it was a monopoly.

<HEAD>Personal Bankruptcies Rise Faster in New England Than Anywhere In
Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Personal bankruptcies have jumped by 31 percent in
New England, more rapidly than any other region, reflecting a
softening regional economy that also has taken its toll on banks
and businesses.
   Analysts say bankruptcies, once considered by some the refuge of
high-flyers who play the game and lose, are becoming the resort of
New England's average Joes, who get caught between pervasive
layoffs, a daunting debt load and plunging real estate values.
   ``I'm not surprised by the fact that this is happening. All of a
sudden the door is closed,'' said Edward J. Powers, who studies New
England as a consulting economist with William Witter Inc., a New
York-based pension fund management company. ``A lot of people here
are two paychecks away from bankruptcy, even though this is
supposed to be a conservative region.''
   In 1988, personal bankruptcies totalled 25,417 in New York and
the six New England states, figures from the U.S. District Courts
show. In 1989, that number rose to 33,294, an increase of 31
percent.
   New Hampshire led the list of the seven states, with an increase
in personal bankruptcies of 55 percent, while in Massachusetts the
increase was 50 percent. On the other end of the scale, Vermont
actually showed a decrease of 4 percent.
   Compared to New England, the next highest increase in personal
bankruptcies was seen in the district including Alabama, Florida
and Georgia, where the figure rose 27 percent from 63,139 to 80,271.
   Personal bankruptcies have risen only 12 percent nationwide, to
616,753, court figures show.
   In ordinary times, personal bankruptcies stem most often from a
major medical illness, said Judy Kent of the American Fiscal
Services Association in Washington, D.C., a financial services
trade association which compiled the figures. In addition to bad
budgeting, divorce and job loss can also lead an individual to file
proceedings, Kent said.
   In New England, however, the rise in personal bankruptcies comes
as the region hurtles downward from the boom years in the 1980s,
when its four main industries _ high-tech, construction, defense,
and financial services _ took off. Those industries have largely
contracted, with revenues falling off and widespread layoffs
announced.
   ``We had the fastest rise (in personal bankruptcies) in part
because we had such a booming economy for so long,'' said Wayne
Ayers, chief economist with the Bank of Boston. ``When things slow
down, they often slow down with a vengeance.''
   ``There hasn't been a rise in major medical illnesses in New
England,'' said David Wyss, chief economist for Data Resources, an
economic research group in Lexington. Rather, Wyss says, the region
is seeing more bankruptcies because of the soft real estate and job
markets here.
   ``It's the average Joe who is caught up in this: relatively
young, with little or no assets, and who borrowed heavily to buy
his first home, and now he's caught,'' said Wyss.
   In Massachusetts, the unemployment rate has gone from 3.5
percent in November 1988 to 5.3 percent in February 1990, a rise
mimicked throughout the region.
   ``A lot of people had, of course, acquired consumer debt and
household debt, and when you lose your job you can't pay it. They
cannot pay the debts they undertook in better times,'' Wyss said.
   Major employers such as Wang Laboratories Inc., Digital
Equipment Corp. and General Electric Co. have laid off thousands of
workers, and the financial services industry has cut back 20
percent of its jobs in New England, Powers said. Those layoffs have
led to job losses at barber shops, restaurants and clothing stores,
Powers said.
   Bankruptcy happens, he said, ``in high pockets of unemployment,
where people are overwhelmed. When the downturn surrounds them
inside their region, how can you sell anything? It's just very
difficult.''
   Changes in law have also made declaring bankruptcy less
financially painful, analysts said. The deals each debtor strikes
still depends on how creditors, litigators and judges assess the
depth of his fiscal desperation. But now, in many cases, people can
keep their house and car, Powers said.
   Analysts agreed declaring bankruptcy had also lost some of the
disgrace it carried years ago, though they acknowledged it was a
process most people wanted to avoid.
   ``In Japan people commit suicide rather than file bankruptcy.
It's the ultimate disgrace. It's called seppuku,'' said Powers.
``Whereas over here, it's not immoral or disgraceful anymore. It's
part of the culture now.''
   ``There has been an increase in the willingness of people to go
bankrupt,'' said Wyss of Data Resources. ``There is not as much
stigma. They can continue to work and probably get a new credit
card tomorrow.''

<HEAD>Trump Shuttle Gives Away Gifts for Late Flights</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump's promise to compensate everyone on
the flight if his shuttle airline is late turned into a bonanza for
hundreds of passengers as fog floated over airports in Boston and
New York.
   But officials of Trump Shuttle say the foul weather on the first
two days of the offer guaranteed the success of the promotion.
   Trump Shuttle announced the guarantee offer Tuesday _ one day
before fog set in at Boston's Logan International Airport. The
airline, which links New York with Boston and Washington,
guaranteed passengers they would receive a choice of premiums if
any of its hourly flights arrived more than 15 minutes late.
   LaGuardia Airport in New York was closed to incoming flights for
about 3{ hours Thursday morning, halting the shuttle's 6:30 a.m., 7
a.m. and 8 a.m. EST flights from Boston and Washington, said Bruce
Nobles, president of Trump Shuttle. Outgoing flights were allowed
to take off in the meantime, and the shuttle was back on schedule
by 9 a.m., he said.
   ``This wasn't a catastrophe,'' Nobles said in a telephone
interview. ``Mr. Trump is very happy with the promotion. We are so
comfortable with the product we will guarantee that product.''
   Trump, the billionaire developer who also owns casinos and
hotels, bought the shuttle service from Eastern Airlines for $365
million last June.
   Pan Am Corp., which operates a rival shuttle service, said
Tuesday it didn't plan to match the on-time offer. A Pan Am
spokesman said Thursday that three of its flights from New York to
Boston were late Wednesday.
   On Wednesday, eight Trump Shuttle flights from New York to
Boston between 6:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. were delayed for more than 15
minutes by heavy fog. But Boston-to-New York flights ran as
scheduled.
   Nobles said about 2,800 passengers were affected by the delays
Wednesday. He said he had no estimate of how many were delayed
Thursday.
   The on-time guarantee gives delayed passengers the choice of a
5,000-mile bonus on the frequent-flier program run by Trump
Shuttle, Eastern and Continental Airlines; a free one-way companion
ticket for Trump Shuttle that can be used any weekend; or a $20
American Express restaurant certificate. The offer is in effect
through March 31.
   Nobles was quick to point out that Trump Shuttle caused none of
the delays. But he also noted that the airline knew when it
launched the promotion that ``we can't guarantee that the weather
will be perfect.''
   Nobles said the airline did not yet have an accounting of what
gifts passengers preferred. He estimated that half the passengers
opted for the frequent-flier miles, which was what the company had
anticipated, with the others choosing either the companion ticket
or the restaurant certificate.
   For Wednesday's delayed passengers, Trump Shuttle could pay
approximately $18,480 in restaurant certificates and around $72,996
in free companion tickets, he said. Off-peak weekend tickets on the
shuttle are $79 one way.
   Nobles said the payoff would not be hard to handle and would
fall within company projections.

<HEAD>Automakers Paying Shoppers To Compare</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the auto industry's never-ending search to
find new ways of selling cars and trucks, two makers are paying
customers to do what comes naturally _ comparison shop.
   Nissan Motor Corp. is offering $100 to anyone who test drives
one of its Stanza sedans _ but they only get the money if they end
up buying a Honda Accord or Toyota Camry.
   Chrysler Corp. in February offered $50 to anyone who bought a
car after test-driving a comparable Chrysler product _ no matter
what company made the vehicle.
   The smartest shoppers could have pocketed $150 _ if they bought
an Accord or Camry in the last two weeks of February and simply
drove a Stanza and a comparable Chrysler product. The Nissan
promotion began Feb. 12 and ends April 30.
   The cash offers are the latest stunt in the ongoing trend of
comparison advertisements in the auto industry. Automakers no
longer use ``Brand X'' in advertising _ they name names.
   A Federal Trade Commission rule change in the mid-1970s allows
direct comparisons if the claim is substantiated.
   Perhaps the best-known comparison advertising battle on the auto
scene is between Chevrolet and Ford trucks.
   Chevrolet aired a ``Ditch of Doom'' advertisement last year in
which a Chevrolet truck plowed through a muck-filled ditch,
shifting into four-wheel-drive while moving. Occupants of a Ford
truck had to stop, get out and slog through the refuse to lock
front-wheel hubs, giving the truck four-wheel-drive capability to
get through the trench.
   Chevrolet's latest series, dubbed ``Ford County,'' said
Chevrolet trucks outsold Ford trucks in Ford County, Ill. That was
just true enough for Ford to seize on the claim.
   Ford acknowledged in ads that for a month or two, Chevrolet
outsold Ford in that county. But for the previous 12 months, Ford
said, its trucks outsold Chevrolet trucks nationwide, including
Ford counties in several states and in Chevy Chase, Md.
   Along with the obvious goal of more sales, comparison ad
campaigns are designed to lure people into showrooms, said Jim
Wangers, president of Automotive Marketing Consultants Inc. in
Vista, Calif.
   ``Most of the retail people feel, `If I can get them in and get
them on my grounds, I'll sell them,''' Wangers said Thursday.
``There is a percentage of the people who they can close (in a
sale) if they can get them in.''
   Chrysler and Nissan dealers could use more traffic in their
showrooms.
   During the first two months of the year, Chrysler's total
vehicle sales of 305,985 were down 1.4 percent compared with
January and February last year and Nissan's total vehicle sales
were 89,974, off 16.3 percent.
   The Nissan offer works like this: a potential buyer test drives
a Stanza between Feb. 12 and April 30 and fills out an evaluation
form. The dealer reviews it, keeps one copy, sends another to
Nissan headquarters and gives one to the consumer.
   If the consumer takes delivery of an Accord or Camry within
seven days of the Stanza test drive and attaches the purchase order
to the copy of the Nissan evaluation, the consumer gets the $100 by
mail from Nissan in four to six weeks.
   If the consumer buys the Stanza, said Nissan spokesman E.C.
Mueller, there's no cash reward.
   Chrysler spokesman Tom Jakobowski said the results of Chrysler's
$50 test-drive program, which ran only in February, were
proprietary information.
   ``I don't have any inside knowledge,'' Wangers said. ``but a
program that is that simple, if it was working, they would keep
it.''

   Assets of the nation's 501 money market mutual
funds rose $60.3 million to a new all-time high of $390.77 billion
in the latest week, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise broke the previous record of $390.71 billion set a week
earlier, the institute said. That record originally was reported as
$390.79 billion but was revised downward by the Washington-based
trade group.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 245
general purpose funds rose $716.5 million to $133.62 billion,
assets of 102 broker-dealer funds rose $133.3 million to $166.14
billion, and assets of 154 institutional funds fell $789.5 million
to $91.01 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.65 percent from 7.63 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield remained unchanged at 7.64 percent.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
43 days, up from 42 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.25 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.26 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.06 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.88
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.86 the
previous week. Yields were 7.97 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.96
percent; 7.96 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.95 percent; and
8.03 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.01 percent.

On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled
at $398.10 a troy ounce, up 10 cents.
   Currency dealers said a comment by President Bush suggesting he
would welcome a drop in interest rates sapped bullish sentiment
toward the dollar out of the foreign exchange market.
   A rumor that Japan might raise its discount rate by 1{
percentage points also had a negative impact on the dollar. Higher
Japanese rates would enhance returns on yen-denominated investments
and tend to bolster demand for yen.
   Robert Morrissey, a senior currency trader at the Bank of
Boston, said the Bush comment in a speech to the National
Association of Manufacturers renewed speculation that the White
House and the Federal Reserve might be at odds over interest rate
policy.
   Bush told the manufacturers lower rates remain a priority of his
administration, saying ``We need to keep interest rates down.''
   Meanwhile, Morrissey said the Japanese discount rate rumor
reinforced the selling pressure on the dollar. Nonetheless, the
dollar managed to close in New York at a higher rate against the
yen than on Wednesday.
   The dollar also was under pressure from profit taking ahead of
U.S. economic reports due Friday on wholesale inflation, industrial
production and housing starts.
   The dollar closed in New York at 1.6990 West German marks, down
from 1.7110 late Wednesday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 152.47 Japanese yen, up from
152.20 yen. In London late Thursday, the dollar closed at 152.55
yen. In New York, the dollar bought 152.285 yen, up from 152.18 yen
late Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound regained some recent lost ground
against the dollar. It closed at $1.6177 in London, up from $1.6090
late Wednesday. Later, in New York, a pound fetched $1.6215
compared to $1.6103 on Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late quotes
Wednesday, included: 1.5180 Swiss francs, down from 1.5245; 5.7415
French francs, down from 5.7805; 1,255.00 Italian lire, down from
1,263.00; and 1.18085 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1733.
   Selected late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late
rates Wednesday, were: 1.7025 West German marks, down from 1.7131;
1.5222 Swiss francs, down from 1.5255; 5.7545 French francs, down
from 5.7877; 1.9265 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9290; 1,257.25
Italian lire, down from 1,267.00; and 1.1778 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1740.
   Gold and silver prices turned in mixed performances at home and
abroad.
   A troy ounce of gold bullion was quoted at $398.50 late in
London, down from $399.05 late Wednesday. The late gold bid in
Zurich was $398.40 an ounce, down from $399.25. Earlier in Hong
Kong, gold closed at $397.52 an ounce, down from $398.75.
   In New York, silver bullion for current delivery closed at
$5.079 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange, down from $5.081 on
Wednesday. Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.10 a troy
ounce, up from $5.09.

<HEAD>US Trade Official Says `Zero Progress' Led to Breakoff of Talks
with Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Talks with the Japanese on a key trade dispute
involving purchases of American satellites broke off this week
after ``zero progress'' had been made, a disappointed U.S. trade
official told reporters Thursday.
   The official said that no further talks would be held unless the
Japanese budge from their current position.
   ``The talks this week have been dancing in circles without
getting anywhere near the destination and the music is about to run
out,'' said the official, who briefed reporters on condition that
his name not be used.
   Satellites are one of three U.S. product groups that have been
targeted for the removal of trade barriers by the Japanese. If
significant progress has not been made by June 15, the
administration has the power to retaliate by imposing higher
tariffs on Japanese products.
   The official said that discussions in the other two areas _
American lumber products and supercomputers _ were apparently
making some progress but that the discussion on satellites was
``the sore thumb. It is sticking out.''
   The talks on specific products, being held under a toughened
portion of the trade law known as Super 301, are one of the key
avenues the administration is pursuing in an effort to reduce the
huge $49 billion trade deficit with Japan.
   Japanese negotiators met with U.S. officials in Washington for
two days on the satellite issue earlier this week. The talks moved
to wood products on Thursday and were to address supercomputers
early next week.
   The satellite talks marked the fourth time negotiators had met
on this issue since last summer. The American side is seeking
assurances that the Japanese government, which is responsible for
the bulk of satellite purchases in Japan, will stop favoring
Japanese firms in the bidding process.
   The negotiator said that the United States is willing to exempt
research and development efforts by the Japanese who want to
promote their own space industry. However, he said Japanese
negotiators were insisting that virtually all satellite projects
fell under the definition of basic research.
   The U.S. trade official said he had told his Japanese
counterparts that another meeting on satellites would be a waste of
time unless the Japanese position changed.
   ``We made zero progress at this meeting,'' he said. ``If they
call up with a new proposal and it looks like there is some meat
there, then we will meet again.''
   In addition to the talks on satellites, supercomputers and wood
products, the administration has launched discussions aimed at
removing more broadbased barriers to trade in both countries. The
next round of talks on so-called strucutral impediments are
scheduled to be held in Washington on April 2 and 3, but so far
little progress has been made in these discussions.
   President Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu met in
Palm Springs, Calif., recently with both leaders pledging renewed
efforts to reach compromises in the various trade disputes.

   The stock market eked out a small gain Thursday
as Wall Street quietly awaited an approaching ``witching hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 18 points at
its midsession peak, closed with a 7.88 gain at 2,695.72.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 749 up, 690
down and 511 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 144.41 million
shares, against 145.06 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 175.33 million shares.
   Much of the financial world's attention was focused on Friday,
when the markets have a date with the quarterly ``triple witching
hour'' involving a set of expiring options and futures on stock
indexes.
   The witching hour has acquired a reputation for unpredictable
turbulence, which tends to discourage traders from taking positions
before it happens.
   Also on the agenda for Friday are several reports from the
government on the state of the economy, including industrial
production and the producer price index of finished goods for
February.
   Brokers said investors seemed fairly confident that the data
would support recent hopes that the economy could recover from its
recent slowdown without having to undergo a full-scale recession.
   The producer price index is expected to show little or no change
for last month after taking a 1.8 percent jump in January.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose } to 107; General Motors } to 47|; American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph &lsqb; to 41&lsqb;; General Electric \ to 63\, and Philip Morris
&lsqb; to 38.
   Glaxo Holdings, which posted a 27 percent increase in pretx
profits for the six months through Dec. 31, gained 1&lsqb; to 25&lsqb;.
   Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust plunged 6{ to 6\, recording by far the
day's biggest percentage loss. The trust said it didn't make a
payment that was due Tuesday on certain maturing debts, and added
that it was talking with lenders in an effort to obtain funds for
its short-term needs.
   Xtra tumbled 4&lsqb; to 26\. Expectations that the company might be
acquired faded with the apparent victory of a dissident shareholder
group in a proxy fight for positions on Xtra's board of directors.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $10.16 billion, or
0.31 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .52 to 186.20.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.62 to 391.24, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.20 at 338.07.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
1.91 to 438.06. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 362.27, up .90.

   The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday
it will extend a ban on the use of sulfites to include fresh
potatoes because of severe allergic reactions to the preservative,
including four deaths.
   The FDA banned use of sulfites on fruit and produce on salad
bars in 1986, but potatoes were excluded from the ban. After strong
industry lobbying, the FDA decided to study further whether the ban
should extend to potatoes.
   An industry spokesman said the ban would have little impact on
consumers but would hurt many businesses that prepare potatoes for
use in restaurants.
   The agency said it has received nearly 1,000 complaints of
adverse reactions to sulfites since 1985.
   Most of the reported reactions were mild, including dizziness,
cramps or wheezing. But, occasionally, reactions can cause
breathing difficulty that can lead to death.
   Four deaths have been reported after consumption of
sulfite-treated potatoes, the FDA said.
   Up to a million asthmatics may be sensitive to sulfites, the
agency said.
   The new ban, published in Thursday's Federal Register, will go
into effect in 30 days.
   Bruce Silverglade of the Center for Science in the Public
Interest applauded the ban on sulfite-treated potatoes, saying it
was ``long overdue and indicative of a new outlook on these types
of problems'' by the federal government.
   Sulfites are used on peeled potatoes to keep them white and
firm. The preservative usually is added after potatoes are cut up
for distribution to fast food and other restaurants to be cooked as
french fries and hash brown potatoes.
   The ban will prohibit using sulfites on these potatoes before or
after they reach the restaurant.
   Robert Mercer, president of the National Potato Board, the
promotional arm of the industry, said the ban ``won't mean too much
to industry'' because there are alternatives to sulfites, though
they are more expensive and less efficient. He also said ``it won't
mean much difference to consumers.''
   The FDA said it also may ban use of sulfites on frozen potatoes
that are distributed to restaurants.
   This use is not common, the agency said, and when the
preservative is used for this purpose, these products are required
to be labeled as containing sulfites. However, a restaurant patron
who is sensitive to sulfites probably would not see the label and
could be at risk, the FDA said.
   Six sulfites are used as preservatives: sulfur dioxide, sodium
sulfite, sodium and potassium bisulfite, and sodium and potassium
matabisulfite.
   When used in prescription drugs, wines and packaged foods _
including packaged potatoes _ the preservative must be noted on
labels.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the ageny had no plans to
consider banning sulfites in canned or dehydrated potatoes. The
industry maintains there is no alternative to sulfites for these
products, he said.

   Three measures of the nation's money supply rose
in the week ended Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Board reported
Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,269.3 billion from $3,264.4 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,074.7 billion from $4,072.6 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $807 billion from $805 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 7 percent,
which is at the upper limit of the Fed's target range of 3 percent
to 7 percent. The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.9 percent, which is
within the Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The
Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,239.2 billion, a 6.9
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,045.2 billion, up 3.4 percent, while M1
rose 5.2 percent to an average of $797.6 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $12 million.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $74 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$115 million the previous week. The figure was the lowest since
such accounting began in February 1984.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $660
million in the two weeks ended March 7, up from $389 million in the
previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $301.3 billion in the two-week period ended
March 7, up from $300.6 billion two weeks earlier.

   Gasoline futures prices surged Thursday, boosted
by reports of refinery problems and new government statistics that
confirmed a decline in the nation's gasoline stocks.
   Analysts said the reports focused on possible problems at Exxon
Corp. refineries in Louisiana, Texas and New Jersey and led to
concerns about possible disruptions of gasoline supplies.
   Initial reports later proved to be exaggerated and apparently
related to routine maintenance, analysts said. Exxon did not return
telephone calls seeking details.
   Meanwhile, the Department of Energy's report on the nation's
petroleum inventories supported Tuesday's figures from the American
Petroleum Institute that showed declines in gasoline and heating
oil stocks last week and a rise in crude oil inventories.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for
wholesale unleaded gasoline shot up 2.09 cents to finish at 57.94
cents a gallon after a 0.98-cent rise on Wednesday.
   May unleaded gasoline gained 2 cents to 62.94 cents a gallon and
June rose 1.65 cents to 62.65 cents a gallon.
   Heating oil also had a strong day despite continued warm weather
in the Northeast. April heating oil closed at 54.98 cents a gallon,
up 0.96 cent, May advance 0.98 cent to 53.43 a gallon and June
ended at 52.95 cents, up 0.77 cent.
   Crude oil futures, pulled along by strength in product, also
advanced. The April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the main
grade of U.S crude, rose 33 cents to $20.38 cents a barrel. May
rose 36 cents to $20.68 and June went up 35 cents to $20.80 a
barrel.
   Analysts said a meeting of OPEC's monitoring committee scheduled
to begin Friday might have added some strength to the crude market.
   ``There was some short covering prior to the OPEC meeting
although most traders don't expect anything positive or anything at
all to come out of this,'' said Andrew Lebow, senior broker and
analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   OPEC ministers are expected to review the group's price and
production policies in light of current market conditions in
preparation for May's full conference of the 13-member Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

<HEAD>Soybean, Sugar Futures Surge On Fears of Fewer Brazilian Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean and sugar futures prices rose sharply Thursday, partly
reflecting fears that Brazil's new president will seek higher taxes
and restrictions on exports of some of the country's major
commodities.
   On other commodity markets, grain futures advanced; petroleum
futures rose; copper surged while precious metals were mixed;
cattle futures retreated; and pork futures were mixed.
   Soybean futures settled 9 cents to 13{ cents higher on the
Chicago Board of Trade with the contract for delivery in March at
$5.86 a bushel.
   Analysts linked some of the buying to rumors that Brazilian
President Fernando Collor de Mello, who took office Thursday,
planned to seek an export tax on Brazilian soybeans and soy
products as one of many measures aimed at stabilizing the country's
foundering economy.
   Such a tax would raise the cost of Brazilian soybeans closer to
that of U.S. soybeans on the world market and could discourage
Brazilian growers from marketing their crops quickly.
   Collor de Mello was scheduled to announce his economic proposals
Friday.
   The late rally in the soybean pit erased much of the losses
registered earlier in the week and prompted speculation that prices
may have to move even higher to persuade U.S. farmers to market
their soybean stocks.
   ``The daily demand is exceeding the daily supply,'' said Bill
Biedermann, research director with the commodities brokerage
Allendale Inc.
   Indications of new export business also supported the grain and
soybean markets. The Soviet Union was believed to be in the market
for U.S. corn while China was said to have bid for 300,000 metric
tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 3{ cents higher with March at
$3.84{ a bushel; corn was } cent to 3\ cents higher with March at
$2.47 a bushel; oats were { cent lower to } cent higher with March
at $1.44 a bushel;
   Sugar futures made new 8{-year highs on New York's Coffee, Sugar
&amp; Cocoa Exchange on rumors Brazil may eliminate or reduce exports
to divert more sugar to the country's fuel alcohol program.
   Signs of new demand from Turkey and Eastern European countries
also supported the market, which is in a delicate supply-demand
balance.
   Sugar futures settled .23 cent to .39 cent higher with May at
15.93 cents a pound after trading as high as 16.02 cents during the
session for the first time since mid-1981.
   Copper futures rose sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange on
fears that the 4-day-old strike at the Southern Peru Copper Corp.
could force cancellation of copper shipments.
   Copper ended .05 cent to 3.05 cents higher with March at $1.2805
a pound.
   In New York, gold futures settled 20 cents lower to 10 cents
higher with April at $399.60 a troy ounce; silver futures were 0.2
cent to 0.5 cent lower with March at $5.079 a troy ounce.
   Futures on refined oil products climbed sharply on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, leading crude oil higher, on news of minor
problems at two Exxon refineries and an Arco oil pipeline shutdown
in Texas due to flooding.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 16 cents to 36 cents
higher with April at $20.38 a barrel; heating oil was .63 cent to
.98 cent higher with April at 54.98 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1 cent to 2.09 cents higher with April at 57.94 cents
a gallon.
   Stronger cash markets supported pork futures on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange while cattle futures fell slightly on position
evening ahead of Friday's monthly Agriculture Department report on
cattle on feed in the seven largest cattle-producing states.
   Live cattle futures settled .05 cent to .30 cent lower with
April at 77.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent to .40
cent lower with March at 82.60 cents a pound; live hogs were
unchanged to .43 cent higher with April at 52.70 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .80 cent lower to .32 cent higher with
March at 49.97 cents a pound.

<HEAD>American Airlines Announces New System for Discount Fares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines, the nation's largest
carrier, announced Thursday a new structure for its
advance-purchase fares, raising some and dropping others based on
mileage.
   Spokesmen for two big competitors, United Airlines and
Continental Airlines, said those carriers were studying American's
move and hadn't yet decided whether to match it.
   ``Our plan eliminates peculiarities in the existing fare
structure, which sometimes makes it more expensive to fly to the
next state than halfway across the country,'' said Michael W. Gunn,
American's senior vice president of marketing.
   ``We are simplifying the formula so all affected markets receive
equal treatment.''
   American spokeswoman Mary O'Neill said about half the fares will
be going up and half going down, although the amount of reductions
will generally be larger than increases. Off-peak fares will be cut
as much as $31 while peak fares will drop as much as $40. Increases
will range from $2 to $41, the airline said.
   Most of the higher fares are on long-haul routes while the cuts
come on shorter trips, Ms. O'Neill said. The new fares take affect
on April 17.
   The new structure applies both to American's 14-day and
seven-day advance- purchase fares. Fourteen-day fares are the
carrier's cheapest and are non-refundable, while seven-day fares
are 20 percent higher but carry only a 25 percent cancellation
penalty.
   Regular fares remain unchanged.
   Under the new system, a round-trip ticket bought 14 days in
advance for the 189-mile flight from San Jose, Calif., to Reno,
Nev., will drop from $203 to $183 for peak travel. The off-peak
fare will fall from $203 to $158.
   A similar ticket for the 466-mile Buffalo, N.Y.,-to-Chicago
flight goes from $260 to $251 for peak travel. The $218 off-peak
fare stays the same.
   Examples of increased fares include the 1,378-mile trip from
Dallas-Fort Worth to New York, with peak fares rising from $384 to
$412 and off-peak fares jumping from $343 to $358.
   A Los Angeles-to-New York flight, covering 2,459 miles, goes
from $468 to $492 for peak travel and from $426 to $428 for
off-peak.

   President Bush on Thursday voiced concern
about the nation's slowing economy and called for industry and
government to redouble efforts to boost U.S. competitiveness and
reap a ``growth dividend.''
   ``There is a great deal we have to do to keep this expansion
going,'' the president told a group of newspaper executives. ``The
economy at this moment isn't as robust as I'd like to see it.''
   ``I don't want to stand here with some Pollyannish attitude
about the economy,'' he said. ``There are some signs that worry
me.''
   Bush brought up troubling signs of economic weakness both in his
meeting with out-of-town newspaper publishers and editors and in a
morning speech to the National Association of Manufacturers.
   At both forums, however, Bush indicated the signs of weakness
come against a backdrop of a generally sound economy.
   ``This is a marathon, it isn't a sprint,'' he told the
manufacturers, commenting on sluggishness throughout the industrial
sector.
   He told the trade association that changes in Eastern Europe and
Central America ``mark the triumph not only of free ideas but also
free markets'' and so present new trade opportunities.
   In his afternoon session with news executives, Bush said
congressional approval of his proposal for a lower capital gains
tax as well as educational reforms he has proposed would help make
the nation more competitive.
   ``If we're successful, then we're going to have not a peace
dividend but a growth dividend,'' Bush said, using the same phrase
he had used earlier in his NAM speech.
   He told the manufacturers: ``We can't produce the products
needed to capture world markets by focusing on results one quarter
at a time,'' he told his audience.
   The nation's economic growth slumped to an anemic 0.9 percent in
the gross national product in the final three months of 1989; many
economists also are projecting a slow first quarter of 1990.
American manufacturing has been in the doldrums for months.
   ``There are doubters, and I can understand that some worry about
a slowdown,'' Bush said.
   Appearing before Congress' Joint Economic Committee on Thursday,
White House budget director Richard Darman said the economy's poor
performance in the final quarter of 1989 would add $6.2 billion to
the projected budget deficit for next year.
   The added red ink would be in the $12 billion to $15 billion
range if the economy rebounds only gradually, he said.
   Before the new economic performance figures became available,
the administration had estimated that the shortfall for fiscal 1991
_ which begins next Oct. 1 _ would be $100.5 billion.
   The higher the projected deficit, the more difficult it will be
for Congress and the White House to agree to enough budget savings
to obey the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law. That legislation sets
a $64 billion target for the projected 1991 deficit.
   Bush said there have been recent signs of economic improvement,
noting the U.S. trade deficit, although still high, has been
declining. ``We must move aggressively to open markets, not just in
Japan but around the world, and expand our share of global trade,''
Bush said.
   He told the manufacturing trade group that U.S. industry's
resolve would be tested ``as the dramatic new changes in the world
produce new challenges in the world market.''
   ``We must prepare now to meet these challenges. My
administration is committed to an agenda for growth. It is founded
upon investing in our future _ and every sound investment has its
yield. America's yield is the `growth dividend.'''
   Bush's comments were a play on the phrase ``peace dividend,''
which has been used recently to describe the defense savings
expected to accompany the reduction of East-West tensions.
   Bush also prodded Congress to meet an April 1 deadline to
produce a budget resolution for fiscal 1991, a deadline
congressional leaders say will not be met. He said the budget
committees should ``fulfill their legal responsibilities ... It's
time to act. It's time to bring the deficit down.''
   And, even though he told a news conference earlier this week he
was not feuding with Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan over interest-rate
policy, he told the manufacturers, ``We need to keep interest rates
down.'' Greenspan has sought to keep inflation down through higher
interest rates.
   Later, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole urged the business leaders
to establish programs to help troubled youngsters and to involve at
least 10 percent of their employees in helping at-risk youth.
   ``Nothing can match the benefits that come from a one-on-one
relationship between a troubled youth and a caring role model,''
Mrs. Dole said in a speech after Bush's appearance.
   Mrs. Dole is expected to form a commission soon to frame
``national competency guidelines'' to make sure the workforce is
equipped with the right skills for the changing economy. She urged
business leaders to involve local educators in the commission's
report.

   Scott Paper Co. allegedly was cheated out
of up to $1 million by two Michigan businessmen and three companies
that bribed a Scott engineer and put his wife on the payroll for
arranging purchases of needless supplies at inflated prices, a
federal prosecutor said Thursday.
   William M. Engelman, 52, and Gerald M. Chernow, 49, both of
Bloomfield Hills, Mich., were named as defendants in a 21-count
indictment alleging that Scott's S.D. Warren mill in Westbrook was
bilked from March 1984 to June 1987. Engelman and Chernow face
charges of conspiracy, mail fraud, and the use of interstate
facilities in furtherance of private bribery.
   Also named as defendants in U.S. District Court were three
companies owned or controlled by the two men: Modern Research Corp.
and Lincoln Technical Service Inc., both of Troy, Mich.; and ABC
Chemical Corp. of Detroit.
   ``Engelman and Chernow, acting through the three corporations
and with two other alleged co-conspirators, engaged in a commercial
bribery scheme which caused S.D. Warren to purchase substantially
overpriced products in quantities exceeding S.D. Warren's needs,''
the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement Thursday.
   An indictment returned by federal grand jurors on Wednesday
alleges that a former S.D. Warren maintenance engineer, David Hilt,
received merchandise, gift certificates and money orders from the
Michigan companies in exchange for setting up purchases of
expensive roofing and maintenance equipment that the mill did not
need.
   The supplies were marked up from 10 times their cost to 20 times
their cost. Purchases were arranged through salesman Jack D.
Lieberman at Modern Research's branch office in Miami, Fla., the
indictment alleged.
   Eventually, Hilt's wife, Ellen, was put on the payroll of
Lincoln Technical Service, which paid her thousands of dollars in
checks that were based on the amount of materials S.D. Warren
bought from Modern Research, prosecutors said.
   Neither Engelman nor Chernow were immediately available for
comment late Thursday, according to a woman who answered the phone
at Modern Research's office in suburban Detroit. An S.D. Warren
spokesman declined comment.
   Although the Hilts and Lieberman are named in the indictment,
with David Hilt and Lieberman described as co-conspirators, none of
them face charges.
   Federal authorities planned to order Engelman and Chernow to
appear in court once an arraignment date was set.
   ``Assuming they come voluntarily, there will be no need to
arrest them in Michigan,'' said First Assistant U.S. Attorney Jack
Gleason.
   If convicted on all counts, Chernow and Engelman could each face
105 years in prison and $5.25 million in fines, Gleason said.
Modern Research and Lincoln Technical Service could each face $10.5
million in fines, while ABC Chemical could face $6.5 million in
fines, the prosecutor said.
   The 46-page indictment says Modern Research sells chemicals and
maintenance supplies, and ABC Chemical buys, processes and sells
those products, often to Modern Research. Lincoln Technical was
said to provide engineering services, and it is listed in the Troy
phone book as having the same address as Modern Research.
   Philadelphia-based Scott allegedly lost between $750,000 and $1
million in the scheme, which was the subject of a two-year
investigation by federal prosecutors and postal inspectors.

   A lawyer for savings and loan financier
Charles H. Keating Jr. bragged in a 1988 letter released Thursday
that she had successfully pressured federal regulators.
   ``You have the (Federal Home Loan Bank) board right where you
want them and you should be able to reach an agreement ... which
will completely satisfy you,'' Washington lawyer Margery Waxman
wrote in the May 10, 1988, letter.
   Waxman, who was referring to an upcoming meeting with board
officials, told Keating she had ``put pressure on'' M. Danny Wall,
chairman of the bank board and then chief regulator of thrift
institutions.
   House Banking Committee Chairman Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,
D-Texas, who released the letter, said it strongly suggests ``the
fix was in at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.''
   Banking panel aides refused to say how they obtained the letter.
   Wall, who quit earlier this month after harsh congressional
criticism of his handling of Lincoln, said he was ``just stunned by
the tone of this (letter) and its implications.''
   In a telephone interview, he said he never met with Waxman about
Keating, adding ``It's a lawyer trying to justify a fee.''
   Waxman's law firm, Sidley &amp; Austin, denied in a statement that
it applied political pressure to the bank board or its employees.
The only pressure it exerted, the statement said, was advising the
bank board Keating was considering filing a law suit.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision, which succeeded the bank board
as S&amp;L regulator, said the letter ``is riddled with errors and
false conclusions.''
   Keating is chairman of American Continental Corp., a holding
company that owned Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, Irvine,
Calif. The S&amp;L failed in April and is expected to require the
nation's costliest S&amp;L bailout, about $2 billion.
   At the time the letter was sent, Keating was fighting federal
efforts to rein in his institution. Bank board examiners based in
San Francisco had recommended that the government seize Lincoln and
Keating had appealed to authorities in Washington.
   ``As you know, I have put pressure on Wall to work toward
meeting your demands and he has so instructed his staff,'' Waxman
wrote. ``They all know the Wednesday meeting is crucial to their
future. If they mess up this time, it is all over.''
   Wall, however, said, ``I would not under any circumstances
threaten anybody with their job. That is not my character. That is
not my way of doing business.''
   The letter was written five days after a divided bank board
decided to move the Lincoln case from the jurisdiction of its San
Francisco office to Washington and on the same day Wall had a
telephone conversation with Keating.
   Waxman outlined what she expected to be the result of the
meeting, including a new examination of Lincoln and memorandum of
understanding between the institution and regulators, which was
executed five days later.
   ``San Francisco is finished,'' she assured Keating. ``Thereis no
going back to San Francisco and nothing can be done to follow up
their exam.''
   In the new exam, she said, ``nothing will be done ... that you
are not aware of in advance.''
   Also, she told Keating that bank board personnel ``will not be
able to enforce any violation (of the memorandum of understanding)
... without going to the board first. ... This will give you two
bites at the apple _ before the board and in court if necessary.''
   ``The letter, written in strong declarative language, tracks
with amazing accuracy the actions taken by the board _ actions
which were interpreted publicly as clamping down on Lincoln,''
Gonzalez said. ``In reality, as the letter carefully explains, the
actions were to be shams designed not to punish but to allow
Keating an escape route.''
   The letter indicates it was telecopied to Keating in Phoenix.
Its existence was first disclosed in stories in Thursday's editions
of the San Francisco Chronicle.
   ``It's clear from the law firm's memo ... that Keating had undue
and unprecedented influence on the board,'' said Rep. Jim Leach of
Iowa, a Republican member of the banking panel. ``This memo would
appear to put Wall at the center point of directing in a powerful,
if not coercive, way his employees to abide by his decision to go
easy on Lincoln.''

<HEAD>Dollar Lower; Stocks Up Moderately</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with morning Nikkei, dollar, no pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   The U.S. dollar remained slightly lower against the
Japanese yen early Friday while stock prices gained moderately.
   The dollar was changing hands at 152.40 yen at late morning,
down from Thursday's close of 152.47 yen.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which rose 319.51
points Thursday, gained 62.28 points, or 0.19 percent, closing the
morning session at 32,733.92.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, speaking at a regular news
conference Friday morning, said he was ``displeased'' with the
yen's weakness and added that the situation was ``fairly serious.''
   Shinji Tanaka, a dealer with Mitsui Bank, said the market's
underlying sentiment toward the dollar remained firm.
   ``Trading was relatively quiet as a hike in the nation's
discount rate faded away, at least for now,'' Tanaka said.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno, just back from a nine-day
European trip, told a news conference Thursday there was no change
in the central bank's fundamental stance of monitoring the effects
of its last rate rise, put into effect last December.
   There has been persistent speculation that Japan's central bank
will again raise its official discount rate by as much as 1
percentage point from the current 4.25 percent.
   The discount rate, the interest rate charged on loans by the
central bank to commercial banks, affects other domestic interest
rates. Higher interest rates tend to enhance yen-denominated
investments.
