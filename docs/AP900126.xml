<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let State Restore Anti-Abortion Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A panel of federal judges on Friday refused
to let Louisiana resume enforcing an old criminal law against
abortion, saying the 1855 statute had been superseded by newer
legislation.
   The Louisiana lawsuit was one of the first initiatives to outlaw
abortions under provisions last year's U.S. Supreme Court ruling
that gave states more authority to restrict abortions.
   Louisiana Attorney General William Guste said he was
disappointed and was considering an appeal of Friday's ruling by a
special three-judge panel.
   Dawn Johnsen, legal director for the National Abortion Rights
Action League in Washington, D.C., called the ruling ``a tremendous
defeat for District Attorney Harry Connick, who was trying to
resurrect an extreme law from 1855 and send women back to the 1800s
when all abortions were prohibited in the state of Louisiana.''
   ``He's been put in his place and will have to act openly and
honestly through the Legislature,'' she said.
   Connick, who was joined by Guste in seeking reinstatement of the
anti-abortion laws, declined to comment, a spokesman said.
   The three-judge panel was set up in the mid-1970s after several
individuals and at least one women's clinic in New Orleans
challenged Louisiana's anti-abortion laws, considered some of the
most restrictive in the nation.
   The result was a 1976 injunction that forbade Louisiana to
enforce the statutes.
   The basis for the plaintiffs' initial request was the 1973 Roe
vs. Wade decision in which the U.S. Supreme Court gave women the
right to have abortions.
   Among other things, the 1855 law required 10 years at hard labor
for doctors convicted of performing abortions.
   The current round of court action followed the U.S. Supreme
Court's ruling last year in Webster vs. Reproductive Services, a
Missouri case in which the high court gave states more power than
they previously had to restrict abortion.
   The Webster ruling prompted Louisiana officials to ask the
three-judge federal court last October to dissolve its 1976
injunction.
   On Friday, the panel refused, saying the Louisiana Legislature,
in effect, repealed most of the state's abortion laws in 1978 when
it passed guidelines under which abortions could be legally
performed.
   ``Each act (in the guidelines) contained provisions stating
that, `All laws or parts of laws in conflict herewith are hereby
repealed,''' the court said in an eight-page opinion.
   The guidelines left one anti-abortion law unchanged _ the
statute making it illegal to advertise the availability of
abortions _ but the court refused to allow enforcement of that
provision.
   The special panel consists of Judge Eugene Davis of the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeal and U.S. District Judges Morey Sear and
Martin L.C. Feldman.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril said Friday
his military government next week would lift a 30-day state of
siege that was imposed as part of a crackdown on his political
opponents.
   Speaking in French on state radio and television, Avril said the
state of siege would be withdrawn on Tuesday because the decree had
achieved ``positive results.'' He did not repeat the speech, as is
common in Haiti, in Creole, the language of 90 percent of the
islanders.
   Avril imposed the state of siege on Jan. 20, one day after the
killing of army Col. Andre Neptune, his wife and a housemaid by
unidentified gunmen.
   In his speech Friday night at the National Parliament, Avril
blamed the killing and a general atmosphere of insecurity on
``terrorists'' and ``political demogogues'' and said it would have
been ``cowardly'' of the government not to take tough action.
   Avril read the speech from behind a desk, the Haitian flag to
his side. He was wearing a short-sleeved army shirt.
   Earlier Friday, France, Haiti's largest donor, suspended
economic aid and talks on a $500 million development package to
protest the military government's crackdown on critics.
   In Paris, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement that France
took the action because of ``the scope of human rights violations
and the interruption of public liberties in Haiti.''
   More than 50 militants have been arrested since the state of
siege was declared last Saturday. Most have been released, saying
they were beaten, but seven prominent leaders have been exiled to
the United States or France, and a radical political leader was
reported missing Thursday.
   Also Friday, the Italian Embassy issued a statement in the name
of the 12-nation European Community condemning the repression and
saying the EC considers ``the measures taken by the military
government as having serious implications for political freedoms
and human rights.''
   French Minister of Cooperation Jacques Pelletier canceled a
visit scheduled for last Monday after ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril
decreed the state of siege, said a French Embassy spokesman.
   An aid package valued at $500 million during the next two years
was to have been negotiated at the suspended meeting of the
Haitian-French Cooperation Commission, said a Haitian official, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   France, Haiti's former colonial ruler, was the most generous
international donor to Haiti in 1989, giving $50 million for
development projects.
   Aid continued at about the same level this year, but in Paris,
the Foreign Ministry said current payments to Haiti also were being
cut.
   Critics have accused Avril of using the colonel's killing as a
pretext to crack down on the opposition and renege on his promise
to hold free elections in October.
   ``France asks the Haitian government urgently to re-establish
the suspended provisions of the Constitution, to reverse the
measures of detention and banishment of opposition leaders and to
guarantee the restarting of an authentic election process,'' the
Foreign Ministry statement said.
   Avril attended Neptune's funeral Friday. About 400 people were
present, including several soldiers, though they were not heavily
armed.
   Rockefeller Guerre, head of the leftist Union of Patriotic
Democrats Party and an outspoken critic of Avril, has been missing
since Monday, his wife said. Three other prominent critics of Avril
remained in hiding Friday, relatives said.
   Haiti, one of the world's poorest nations, received $154 million
in international assistance in 1988, but had been the object of
international ostracism since the November 1987 election-day
massacre of 34 people that authorities say was staged by thugs
working with the army.
   The U.S. government cut off about two-thirds of its $90 million
aid package after the massacre, but Haiti still receives about $40
million in U.S. aid through private voluntary organizations.

   A man at the center of the FBI probe
into two fatal pipe bombings said Friday that frustration over a
civil lawsuit prompted him to write a 1988 letter calling America's
legal system corrupt.
   The letter to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
is what drew investigators' attention to junk dealer Robert Wayne
O'Ferrell, 46. One of the judges on the court was killed in a
series of pipe bombings that also claimed the life of a
civil-rights lawyer.
   O'Ferrell said he wrote the appeals court during a legal fight
with his former employer, Gulf Life Insurance Co.
   ``I had two lawyers quit me. When I wrote that letter, I didn't
know what else to do to fight it,'' he said.
   O'Ferrell has denied any knowledge of the mail bomb killings,
and has not been officially named as a suspect by the FBI.
   He commented Friday as he reopened his salvage store, which had
been closed since Monday when scores of federal investigators
descended on it looking for clues in the pre-Christmas bombings.
   ``I want them to get through and apologize,'' O'Ferrell said of
the FBI agents. ``Things like that just don't happen in the U.S.
... They don't intimidate people and talk to people like they have
me this week.''
   Killed in the bombings were 11th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge
Robert Vance of Birmingham and attorney Robert Robinson of
Savannah, Ga., who had done work for the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People.
   Vance was a member of the three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit
that upheld a lower court's ruling against O'Ferrell in his lawsuit.
   A letter from what appeared to be an unknown white supremacist
group claiming responsibility for the bombings was sent to an
Atlanta television station. The letter was written on a typewriter
matching the one used in O'Ferrell's earlier letter to the 11th
Circuit, according to investigators who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   FBI agents searched O'Ferrell's property extensively, even
sending divers to scour the bottom of a pond, but refused to
discuss what they might have found.
   The FBI also has consulted a Scotland Yard bomb expert to
determine if there is any similarity between the mail bombs and
devices used by the Irish Republican Army, a law enforcement source
in Washington who spoke on condition of anonymity said Friday.
   In addition, the FBI is checking any possible connection between
the package bombs and Brian Joseph Fleming, an Enterprise, Ala.,
man recently indicted on charges of illegally exporting
high-powered weapons, according to federal law enforcement sources
in Washington.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, stressed there
wasn't any reason to believe there was a connection with Fleming,
who federal authorities are investigating for possible links to the
outlawed IRA.
   Fleming's attorney, John L. Knowles, said there was ``no
connection whatsoever'' between O'Ferrell and Fleming, who owns a
printing business. Fleming knew who O'Ferrell is, but isn't really
familiar with him, the attorney said.

<HEAD>Gala Couture at Givenchy, Valentino; Rabanne Wins Prize</HEAD>

   Hubert de Givenchy wound up an exciting week of
summer haute couture with a parade of his gala couture clothes for
women who want to look on the sexy side.
   Spanish-born Paco Rabanne won the Golden Thimble Award for his
amusing, lively collection that made full use of ``new'' materials
like fringed raffia, crystal-globe embroideries and sequined
leather.
   Two-time winner Christian Lacroix finished a close second in the
semiannual prize awarded by an international jury of fashion
journalists.
   Givenchy's show, on Thursday, was magnificent. From caramel
leather shorts topped by fresh and airy white linen blouses to the
most extravagantly opulent evening wear, the show ranked as one of
best this master of the fine art of couture has ever produced.
   His narrow rustic linen suits or belted knee-revealing dresses
in shades of bright blue, rust, peach, and golden sand with their
bold silver buttons couldn't be faulted for daytime.
   Givenchy brought out plenty of trouser suits, tailored in soft
gabardines or shiny linen tweeds. He solved the dilemma of
see-through chiffon blouses with a white-dotted transparent black
number sporting a big floppy bow to hide bosom details.
   The sharp Givenchy silhouette with padded shoulders in suits was
softened up with considerable sexiness for late-day wear. Even the
bridal number was barely more than a sprig of pastel silk flowers
on a prancing nude.
   But the main elements of style were there. Almost every evening
outfit was a show-stopper. His enormous-flowered gazar and organza
evening gowns were breathtaking. The fabrics featured bold poppies,
daisies, lilies of the valley or daffodils on hot-colored
backgrounds of kelly green, citron, tomato, purple or fuchsia.
   Some white faille bustier gowns with black-lace embroidery
glowing with siren-red chiffon or affeta wraps were dynamite,
guaranteeing a grand entrance.
   Valentino, who has shown luxury ready-to-wear for 10 years in
Paris, has finally abandoned Italy as a showcase, choosing a
Trocadero museum auditorium for his second Paris couture show.
   On Wednesday night, he brought out a dazzling show of glamorous
clothes for rich women, the outfits looking particularly light and
young.
   He led off and ended with swingy, short clothes in his original
signature color of white, suits cut with longer jackets and short
skirts, waves of accordion pleats around for dancing skirts.
   Otherwise, Valentino spiced the show with lots of his favorite
hot reds and soft tones like celdadon, wisteria, peach and silvery
gray in the softest of fabrics like cashmere, silk crepe and acres
of flounced chiffon _ a Paris must for couture.
   Valentino used a lot of tricky latticework in his late-day
toppers and the sumptuous evening wear included all kinds of
elaborate draping, pleated transparent capes, sequined pastille
embroideries on chiffon, and tiers of lace.
   Per Spook as usual went his own way in a simplified, sporty view
of couture that has nothing to do with pretension or grandiose
entrances.
   Except for a few charming buttoned jersey short shift dresses,
he seemed allergic to leggy looks. His trouser outfits were cut a
bit baggy around the ankle and he often topped these with cute
layered styles from a bustier top to a blouse-jacket.
   But if the 1990s are going to be full of color and feminine
clothes as most couturiers seem to think, Spook's best
contributions are in some of his bright print sporty toppers and
adorable evening wear.

   Starvation, a constant peril in the war
zone of southern Sudan, once again threatens hundreds of thousands
of people because of intense fighting and government mismanagement.
   Francis Junod, who runs the International Committee of the Red
Cross relief operation, said 350,000 of the region's perennially
malnourished residents may die unless supplies get through by the
end of February.
   Junod said his agency could not accept conditions accompanying a
government offer, announced on television Wednesday, to end a
2{-month ban on supply flights.
   He said the Red Cross was told its planes could fly only to the
government-held city of Juba, which would violate the agency's
pledge to fight famine in areas held by rebels as well as the
government.
   Obstruction and neglect by 7-month-old military junta have
strained its relations with most relief organizations.
   A train loaded with relief supplies has sat since September in
Babanoussa, a railway switching center just north of the famine
area. The army commandeered the locomotives to haul weapons and
U.N. officials decided not to hitch on the relief cars because of
the risk.
   ``I think the new regime is not well-coordinated for what, to
them, is not a vital matter,'' a Western relief worker said. ``It's
more mismanagement than the northern government's not helping the
southerners.''
   Some workers privately accuse the government of limiting the
access to famile areas in order to hide evidence of government
atrocities.
   Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir, leader of the junta, has accused
relief personnel of smuggling weapons and supplies.
   Some agencies are leaving because of the problems, made worse by
an offensive of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   The rebels seek more autonomy from Arab Moslems who domate the
north for an an area the size of Texas populated by blacks who are
predominantly Christian or animist.
   Fighting in the rebel offensive launched in October has been the
most intense of the war, which began in 1983.
   Both sides have used food and deprivation as weapons.
   In 1988, the worst year for innocent civilians, hundreds of
thousands of people starved to death in the swamps, jungles and
deserts of the south. U.N. officials put the total at 250,000, but
others said the number was twice that.
   The United Nations began Operation Lifeline-Sudan last year to
prevent another disaster. It used airlifts, Nile River barges,
trucks and trains to get food into position before floods isolated
vast areas during the rainy season.
   Generally it worked, but a donor meeting scheduled for November
to pledge support for this year has not been held. Relief officials
blame the government for the delay.
   Junod, deputy head of the International Committee of Red Cross
in Geneva, said about 100,000 people in the Bahr el-Ghazal region
and another 250,000 in Juba, the principal city of the south, were
most in danger of starving.
   ``Right now it has the potential for disaster,'' he said.
   The government banned relief flights Nov. 3, ostensibly to allow
time to investigate two unexplained bombing raids on
rebel-controlled airfields areas being supplied by Operation
Lifeline.
   Since then, the government-held towns Aweil and Gogrial and the
rebel strongholds of Mayen Abun and Akon have not been resupplied.
   ``Within a month to six weeks, the people in these towns will
have to move to look for food,'' Junod said. ``We want to try to
avoid large migrations because many die on the away.''
   Juba, capital of the Equatoria region 750 miles south of
Khartoum, the national capital, has been under rebel siege for
months.
   Rebel gunners shelled the city this week, killing about 20
civilians by U.N. count, and urged residents to evacuate. Some
relief workers have left, but there is no place for the civilians
to go.
   Red Cross food stocks in Juba can feed the population for a
month, Junod said. A trickle of supplies, 50-60 tons daily, arrives
on an airlift of the Lutheran World Federation, but each shipment
is enough to for only a day.
   ``Right now it does not look possible to help the people in
northern Bahr el-Ghazal and Juba,'' Junod said. ``We fear there
will be human losses.''
   The Lutheran airlift, from Nairobi in neighboring Kenya, flies
without guarantees of safe passage from either the rebels or
government, and how long it can continue remains a question. Rebel
gunners have shot down at least two civilian aircraft during the
war, with the loss of more than 75 lives.
   After more than two months of effort, the Red Cross has obtained
government and rebel approval for a few flights into the south to
evacuate most of its workers, Junod said.
   He said the agency would leave only few people there. The United
Nations also plans to take non-essential personnel out of the south.
   Medicine Without Borders, a French group that already has left,
lost four staff members to the war last month when their small
plane was shot down. Neither side has accepted responsibility.
   Relief workers say government agents confiscated short-wave
radios from southern cities, removing their only means of
communicating with Khartoum, and that cooperation from military
commanders in the field has become rare.
   Bashir publicly declared support for Operation Lifeline,
however, and it moved 110,000 tons of food and supplies into the
south last summer during a cease-fire he extended month by month.

   What began as a territorial dispute has become an
all-out crusade by Azerbaijanis and Armenians to achieve ethnic,
nationalistic and religious goals.
   Suspicions and hostilities with deep historical roots are
fueling the wave of unrest that began two years ago and escalated
Jan. 13 into brutal ethnic attacks and open warfare.
   The latent tension was exacerbated by current conditions in the
Caucasus: the feeling that economic and political reforms have not
improved people's lives in the largely underdeveloped region
plagued by unemployment and environmental woes.
   The conflict has turned the rugged hills of the southern
Caucasus into what even Soviet officials have called Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's Lebanon: the most protracted and bloodiest
manifestations of the ethnic strife sweeping the Soviet Union and
one of the most serious crises he has faced.
   It has encompassed 15 million people, including residents of
both republics as well as members of the two ethnic groups in
neighboring Georgia and southern Russia.
   Such diverse observers as world chess champion Garri Kasparov,
an Armenian-Jew who was born in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku,
and Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh
agree that ethnic _ not religious motivations _ are foremost.
Armenians are predominantly Christians and Azerbaijanis Shiite
Moslem.
   Western scholars call it an ethnic conflict with religious
overtones.
   Fanatical Azerbaijanis vowed to drive all Armenians off their
land.
   The Azerbaijani People's Front, which has spearheaded the
anti-Armenian campaign, has also called for their republic to
secede from the Soviet Union and establish ``special ties'' with
Iran and other Islamic countries.
   It is not just idle talk.
   Most Armenians were indeed forced out, and the People's Front
was involved in the destruction of border defenses on Soviet
Azerbaijan's frontier with Iran this month. Protesters called for
reunifying Soviet Azerbaijan and the two Azerbaijani provinces of
Iran, a region that was part of Persia until Russian expansion
under the czars forced its division in 1828.
   Tempers of Armenians and Azerbaijanis flared for nearly two
years, heating up each time politicians in Baku, Moscow or the
Armenian capital of Yerevan made decisions concerning
Nagorno-Karabakh, the poor, hilly district of 186,000 people,
mostly Armenians, that is claimed by both sides.
   Nagorno-Karabakh became a battle cry that woke up ancient
hostilities between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. The weekly magazine
Ogonyok on Sunday published an appeal to Armenians and Azerbaijanis
to ``win over each other with love and forgiveness, not weapons and
fire.'' The appeal dates back to July 1905.
   But there has been little attempt to hide the hatred.
   As the feud produced hundreds of thousands of refugees, the
hatred increased and the stones, torches and guns came out.
Hostages were taken, railroad bridges blown up, water pipes
severed, homes burned and Soviet troops ambushed.
   The voice of reason has been losing out to extremism, said
Arkady I. Volsky, formerly the Kremlin's hand-picked administrator
of Nagorno-Karabakh. The point was driven home to him after meeting
with elderly Armenians and Azerbaijanis in a tiny village.
   ``The oldsters emerged from the meeting in a mood of
reconciliation. But young people, inflamed by nationalist rhetoric,
did not go along with them,'' Volsky told the magazine New Times.
   Much of the bitterness, he said, comes from refugees, who
account for 10 percent of the district's population.
   ``These uprooted people are behind all the rallies and
disobedience campaign. They are the base for every kind of
extremism,'' the Kremlin official said even before the latest and
most bloody flareup.
   An estimated 220,000 Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan have
settled in their home republic, many without jobs or homes and more
than willing to take up arms to fight those who drove them away.
Unemployment in Armenia is reported to be 18 percent.
   Refugees are also prime recruits for ethnic militiants in
Azerbaijan, where unemployment is even higher, 27.6 percent. More
than 200,000 Azerbaijanis fled Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. The
Soviet press has suggested it was these downtrodden Azerbaijani
refugees who attacked Armenians in Baku, to drive them out and grab
their apartments.
   Class antagonism also may have played a role. Many of the
Armenians living in Baku were better educated than Azerbaijanis and
financially in privileged positions because of their jobs in the
oil industry that dominates the city.
   Azerbaijanis also saw the Armenians' attempt to regain
Nagorno-Karabakh as an insult to their national pride, and Moscow's
attempts to mediate as an infringement on their sovereignty.
   ``Without Shusha, Azerbaijan has no soul,'' goes an Azerbaijani
saying that refers to a town in Nagorno-Karabakh that historically
has been peopled by Azerbaijanis.
   Armenians are driven by the feeling that their people were
discriminated against in Nagorno-Karabakh under Azerbaijani
leaders, cut off from their home republic, deprived of their
culture, religion and adequate schools and hospitals.
   The Armenians' solution: end the artificial separation of
Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia with its more sympathetic leadership.
   Both sides accuse Moscow of indecision that made matters worse.
The anti-Soviet factor took on added significance after Soviet
troops smashed into Baku on Jan. 20, killing dozens of people. The
action brought more support for a complete political break with
Moscow, and led to attacks on Baku's Russian residents.
   The Azerbaijan People's Front alleges Moscow provoked the Jan.
13 rampages against Armenians in Baku.

<TEXT>
   The Go-Go's will reunite for a benefit
concert to support a campaign to place an environmental protection
initiative on the California ballot this year.
   The all-female band, which had a string of lively pop-rock hits
including ``We Got the Beat,'' ``Vacation,'' ``Head Over Heels''
and ``Our Lips Are Sealed,'' broke up in May 1985 to pursue
individual careers.
   The reunion of all five members was revealed at a news
conference Thursday by singer Belinda Carlisle, guitarist Charlotte
Caffey, drummer Gina Schock and bassist Kathy Valentine.
Guitarist-singer Jane Wiedlin participated by phone from London.
   Actress Jane Fonda also was on hand to outline the campaign for
the California Environmental Protection Initiative, which needs
650,000 signatures to qualify for the November 1990 state ballot.
   Miss Carlisle said the group members have sometimes tossed
around the idea of re-forming.
   ``We decided that if something came along that was worthwhile,
something where all the proceeds would go to somebody else than us,
we would do it,'' she said.
   An active member of Greenpeace for three years, Miss Carlisle
said that having been born and raised in Los Angeles she has seen
the decline of the environment, particularly the beaches along
Santa Monica Bay.
   ``I wouldn't swim in that water if someone paid me,'' she said.
   The initiative's goals include protecting the food supply from
pesticides, reducing gases and chemicals that cause global warming,
enacting stringent clean water standards to protect the coast,
enacting measures to prevent oil spills and ensure cleanup, and
creating an elective office of environmental advocate.
   The reunion concert was scheduled for March 28 at the Universal
Amphitheatre. The reunited Go-Go's were billed as a one-time event,
but Miss Carlisle suggested otherwise, noting that ``everybody's
keeping an open mind.''

   President Bush's nominee to become the Justice
Department's civil rights chief acknowledges he lacks broad
experience on the issue but says he has an ``understanding and a
sensitivity'' about civil rights.
   Former New York state Sen. John R. Dunne was nominated Thursday
by Bush to be assistant attorney general for civil rights, a post
that has been vacant since December 1988. Bush's first choice,
William Lucas, failed to win Senate confirmation last August.
   Dunne, 59, of Garden City, N.Y., spent 24 years in the New York
state Senate, where he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He
resigned in September after losing a battle for Republican majority
leader and is currently a partner in a Long Island law firm.
   On the eve of his nomination, Dunne acknowledged: ``I haven't
had as much experience as I'm sure many civil rights activists
perhaps would like to see.''
   Still, he said he has ``an understanding and a sensitivity and
caring'' about the issue.
   After initial reports in November that Dunne was in line for the
civil rights post, he resigned from the all-male Garden City Golf
Club, to which he had belonged for 32 years. During most of his
years as a state senator, a part-time post, Dunne lived in Albany
at the Fort Orange Club, which until 1988 barred women.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who campaigned for Dunne's
nomination, on Thursday heaped praise on the former legislator.
   ``As a state senator, he has a long list of accomplishments in
the civil rights field,'' Thornburgh said, mentioning Dunne's
sponsorship of the first AIDS confidentiality legislation and a law
restricting the use of age, sex and marital status as insurance
underwriting criteria.
   ``He has devoted most of his professional life as a public
servant dedicated to matters relating to the administration of
justice, including the rights of institutionalized persons and
increased access by the public to legal services,'' Thornburgh said.
   But Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said,
``Actually, I don't have enough information at this point to give
an opinion. We wait to see what this man's record is and we will be
looking at it.''
   Urvashi Vaid, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, said her organization knew little about Dunne's
positions on homosexual rights.
   ``He doesn't seem to have much of a record one way or the
other,'' Vaid said. ``From the administration's point of view, no
position on gay rights is probably better than a positive one.''
   Colleen O'Connor, a spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties
Union, said the New York chapter had found Dunne's record on civil
rights to be lacking. Last year, for example, Dunne opposed NYCLU
positions by voting to reinstate the death penalty; require drug
testing for parolees; seize the assets of certain criminal
suspects; and eliminate Medicaid funding for abortions.
   Dunne has bipartisan support, at least in New York state.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Democrat, sent a letter to Bush
earlier this month calling Dunne ``an honorable and conscientious
public servant, an able lawyer dedicated to the rule of law, a
committed family man and a very decent person.''
   Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel, an old friend and the most
powerful black member of New York's congressional delegation, also
supports Dunne, who is white.
   ``If the president has to pick a Republican, he couldn't pick a
more decent person than John Dunne,'' Rangel said in a recent
interview.
   The Lucas nomination was scuttled by intensive lobbying by civil
rights groups troubled by his lack of legal experience and his
views that Supreme Court rulings had not eroded civil rights
protections under the law.
   Dunne on Wednesday said he had reviewed a videotape of the
Judiciary Committee's grilling of Lucas to prepare for his own
hearings.
   ``I looked at that video again over the weekend and it was a
very tough spot they put him in,'' said Dunne. ``It's an altogether
different ballgame in Washington. Gosh, they play for keeps.''

<HEAD>Fresh Feuding Over Money Looms as Democrats Reject Bush Drug Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats and big-city mayors
are setting the stage for fresh feuding over the war against drugs,
saying President Bush's plan to raise spending by $1.1 billion next
year is inadequate.
   ``We're going to have to have a lot more resources and that's
not in this document,'' House Narcotics Committee Chairman Charles
Rangel, D-N.Y., told a news conference Thursday after Bush
presented his plan.
   The $10.6 billion package includes more money for a Pentagon
attack on cocaine traffickers and would allow the death penalty for
drug kingpins. It would boost the cost next year by 11.6 percent
over the current $9.5 billion.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., on Wednesday proposed a
different version, and debate over the rival strategies could
easily carry over into the fall congressional campaigns.
   Biden's version calls for spending $14.6 billion next year,
including 400,000 new beds in treatment centers and immediate
treatment for pregnant addicts as well as more FBI and drug
enforcement agents and prison expansion.
   Bush presented his plan in a White House speech to newspaper
editors, calling drugs ``this nation's No. 1 concern.''
   He said the Senate most likely will shoot for a higher budget
than what he is requesting but that ``we do sense a desire on the
part of the Congress to cooperate.''
   ``In terms of the objectives of this strategy we're in pretty
close accord with both Democrats and Republicans on the Hill, so I
think we can get early action,'' Bush said.
   Biden, in a breakfast speech to the National Conference of
Mayors, said he hoped to work with the administration ``to
implement the proposals on which we agree and to narrow our
differences on the rest.''
   Biden said his strategy did not carry the endorsement of any
Democratic Party group or even that of Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee.
   A number of Democratic mayors were quick to condemn the
strategy. ``We can't win the war on drugs with $10.6 billion,''
Philadelphia's W. Wilson Goode told reporters.
   ``It is woefully inadequate,'' said New York Mayor David
Dinkins. Several of the mayors expressed support for Biden's
alternative.
   On Capitol Hill, Republican lawmakers and Democrats whose states
stand to gain increased federal funds under the Bush strategy
expressed support.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, called it ``a logical extension of
phase I of the program'' and scoffed at a Biden complaint that it
targets punishing casual users instead of hard-core addicts who
commit most of the crimes.
   ``They're all criminals,'' Gramm said. He said casual use has
``put a drug thug at the door of every junior high school in the
country.''
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., complained that ``one thing is
especially lacking and that is any emphasis whatsoever on rural
America and what the drug problem is out there.''
   He said the nation ``cannot fight the war on drugs if we just
limit it to urban America and the so-called high intensity areas.''
   The strategy designates New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston
and the Southwest border as high-intensity areas and allocates
additional funds.
   Some Democratic senators praised Bush's plan, saying the
additional funds were needed in their states. Sen. Bob Graham,
D-Fla., called it ``a positive sign'' and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, said he was ``encouraged by the president's new anti-drug
initiative.''
   The Pentagon would receive the largest spending increase, from
$878 million this year to $1.2 billion. About $638 million would be
earmarked for detection and monitoring of traffickers attempting to
enter the country with illicit drugs.
   The next largest increase would go to the Alcohol, Drug Abuse
and Mental Health Administration in the Department of Health and
Human Services, from $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. That includes a
raise of $100 million to $577 million in block grant money for drug
treatment programs.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Question Source of US Aid to Panama</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some lawmakers are reacting cautiously to
President Bush's proposed $1 billion aid plan for Panama, with one
senator saying Congress wants to help the country but predicting a
``tough battle'' on how much to give.
   ``That's a substantial amount of money for a tiny country,''
said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., echoing questions that others also
raised about the amount Bush is proposing for the country he
ordered the U.S. military to invade on Dec. 20.
   ``Where's it going to come from?'' asked Rep. Peter Kostmayer,
D-Pa., a member of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
Western Hemispheric affairs. ``It's too much.''
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger planned to
provide additional details of the plan to senators today, the day
after Bush unveiled it. To spend the money, the administration must
submit a supplemental appropriation requiring congressional
approval.
   ``These programs will give as close to instant relief as we can
expect here,'' Bush told reporters on Thursday.
   The package will include $500 million in humanitarian assistance
for housing, emergency public works, business assistance, loans and
export opportunities. Some money would be used to rebuild houses
destroyed in the military invasion.
   Another $500 million would go to balance-of-payment support,
public investment and economic restructuring in a country whose
economy was tattered by Manuel Antonio Noriega's corrupt regime.
Noriega, who surrendered to U.S. troops, is in jail in Florida
facing drug-trafficking charges.
   Bush said some of aid money would be siphoned away from other
countries' foreign aid programs, but he and other administration
officials did not give specifics.
   Simon said he had learned that $30 million would come from
programs originally designed to help Somalia and the Sudan. He said
he would oppose redirecting the money.
   If the aid is approved, Panama would become one of the largest
recipients of U.S. foreign assistance.
   Lawmakers generally say they are eager to do something for
Panama. ``I applaud that effort,'' said Sen. Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Sen. Richard
Lugar, R-Ind., agreed.
   But several members peppered Bernard Aronson, the deputy
secretary of state for inter-American affairs, with questions about
Panama's future.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, asked Aronson what
is being done to ensure that Panamanians return the billions of
dollars in capital that left the country during the Noriega regime.
   Dodd said it would be more politically palatable for members to
approve aid if the Panamanians are committed to helping themselves.
   ``It's going to be a tough battle to get anything through
(Congress),'' said Dodd, noting foreign aid is traditionally
unpopular, particularly during tight budget years.
   Dodd also expressed concern that Noriega associates would
benefit. ``My concern is that we are changing the name, changing
the uniform, but they are still the same people,'' he said.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a longtime opponent of foreign
assistance, suggested taking money the United States gives to the
Organization of American States and sending it to Panama. Some
Latin countries criticized the U.S. invasion of Panama, and Helms
said he was tired of helping countries that ``kick us in the teeth
and cuss us out.''
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., urged the administration to press for
reform of the Panamanian banking system to prevent bankers from
hiding or laundering money from drug deals.
   Aronson assured senators the U.S.-installed government of
President Guillermo Endara is committed to revitalizing the country
and making sure the ``old PDF (Panamanian Defense Force) monster
disappears.''
   He said the country needs help in part because of its external
debt of roughly $4 billion and its unemployment rate of more than
25 percent.
   Moreover, he said the Bush administration wants to work closely
with Congress to eliminate all sanctions against the country that
were put in place in an attempt to drive Noriega from office. Those
sanctions resulted in a 20 percent loss in Panama's gross national
product, he said.
   Meantime, Vice President Dan Quayle is scheduled to discuss the
aid proposal in a meeting with Endara this weekend during a visit
to Panama.

   Paul Newman turns 65 today, and workers
at his food company, Newman's Own, plan to make sure he doesn't
ignore it.
   They were busy making a huge popcorn cake to present to the
actor today.
   ``I think he's just going to avoid his birthday,'' said author
A.E. Hotchner, executive vice president of Newman's Own and a good
friend of Newman's.
   The recipe for the cake comes straight from Newman's Own Gourmet
Popcorn Recipe Book, a book put out by Newman's food company. The
company also has recipes for salad dressing, lemonade and spaghetti
sauce.
   The cake was baked, or rather popped, Thursday at the company's
Westport headquarters.
   ``It's growing by leaps and bounds,'' Hotchner said late
Thursday.
   Hotchner said the goal is to make a cake as tall as Newman.
   ``We'll submit the measurements to the Guinness Book of World
Records to ensure Mr. Newman's immortality,'' he said.

   Instead of staying up to watch the
American Music Awards, Bill Pettaway set the timer on his
videocassette recorder and dropped off to sleep. His slumber didn't
last long.
   Toward the end of this week's three-hour program, a caller woke
him up to say that ``Girl, You Know It's True,'' which he co-wrote
for Milli Vanilli, had been named the pop-rock single of 1989.
   A few hours later, after congratulatory calls from all over the
world, the 29-year-old was back at his ``day job,'' pumping gas at
a service station.
   ``The excitement's over for me,'' he said Wednesday, less than
48 hours after winning the award.
   It was a typical reaction from Pettaway, who said the secret of
his success is not to let success change him.
   ``I've been successful and happy my entire life, and even if I
didn't have a hit record, I'd still be happy,'' he said.
   Pettaway co-wrote ``Girl, You Know It's True'' with Ky Adeyemo.
Milli Vanilli's version has sold 2.5 million copies worldwide.

   The Rev. Billy Graham says the political
upheaval in Eastern Europe is overshadowing another revolution
there _ a surge in Christian faith.
   ``This is something new,'' said the 71-year-old evangelist.
``They have a freedom to talk and preach and have Bible classes.
   ``They are beginning to print thousands of Bibles in the Soviet
Union, and in many places I understand that Sunday schools are
being opened, which have been forbidden through all these years.
They've had 70 years in which none of these things happened.''
   Graham said the growing religious fervor in Eastern Europe was
evident in July when 100,000 packed a stadium in Budapest, Hungary,
to hear him.
   ``Our largest crowds were in Romania, where we went from city to
city,'' he said. ``Some people feel this is a demonstration not
only of the spiritual hunger but also the desire of the people for
more freedom.''
   Graham preached in cathedrals throughout the Soviet Union in
1988 during a celebration of 1,000 years of Christianity in that
country.

   Filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola and one
of his film companies sought bankruptcy protection from creditors,
but his filming of the third ``Godfather'' movie continued in Rome.
   Coppola and Zoetrope Productions filed separately Thursday in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Rosa under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Act. That allows them freedom from creditors' lawsuits
while they try to work out a repayment plan.
   Zoetrope issued a statement saying the filings were intended to
provide protection from continued legal wrangling that began during
production of Coppola's 1981 film ``One From the Heart,'' a $26
million picture that drew just $1 million at the box office.
   The filings were made while Coppola was in Rome, directing ``The
Godfather Part III'' for Paramount Pictures. The $40 million movie
was on budget and unaffected by the bankruptcy filings, Paramount
senior vice president Deborah Rosen said.
   Coppola did not total his assets or liabilities in his filing.

   For actor Anthony Hopkins, the chance to
direct a one-man play about poet Dylan Thomas is an opportunity to
reconnect with his heritage.
   Hopkins will direct ``Dylan Thomas: Return Journey,'' featuring
Bob Kingdom based upon the Welsh poet's work, anecdotes and
letters. The show makes its U.S. debut Feb. 16 in Pittsburgh.
   ``I'd always wanted to play Dylan Thomas myself, being Welsh,''
Hopkins said. ``When I heard Bob Kingdom was doing it, I didn't
have any resentment. I thought, `Well, I'm a bit too old to do it
now.'''
   The show will first play to British audiences, then come to
Pittsburgh and New York.
   Hopkins was in Pittsburgh on Thursday, where he is filming ``The
Silence of the Lambs.'' He stars in the psychological thriller with
Jodie Foster.
   Hopkins, 52, has performed in numerous Shakespeare plays and
starred in the films ``War and Peace,'' ``The Bunker'' and ``The
Elephant Man.''

<HEAD>Bush Claims Mandate From Failure to Override Chinese Students Veto</HEAD>

   President Bush, savoring a major triumph over
Congress, is claiming a mandate to deal with China ``the way I feel
is correct'' despite widespread opposition to his policies from
Democrats and Republicans alike.
   ``Surprised you, didn't it?'' Bush exclaimed Thursday after the
Senate, by a four-vote margin, upheld his veto of a politically
popular bill protecting Chinese students from deportation.
   Bush said the victory would ``be helpful in reaching
accommodation'' with the Senate and House on other matters.
   Senators voted 62-37 against Bush but the vote failed to meet
the two-thirds margin needed for an override. The House had voted
390-25 a day earlier against the president.
   In part, the issue was an election-year test of strength between
a Republican president and a Democratic Congress. However, it was
not a strictly partisan battle since 145 Republicans in the House
and eight in the Senate joined with Democrats in trying to override
Bush.
   While Bush emerged the winner, the votes provided a clear
measure of congressional displeasure with his secret diplomacy with
Beijing and his refusal to deal harshly following the crackdown
against China's pro-democracy forces.
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said the bill represented
``America's symbol to the world that is struggling to throw off the
chains of dictators.''
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said that letting the veto stand
sends ``the signal that they can get away with what they have done
and retain their power. And I think that's wrong.''
   Yet Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said the showdown
was the equivalent of ``throwing out the first ball'' of the 1990
election season and was being used by Democrats to force
Republicans to cast ``a tough political vote'' for the president.
   Bush said he regarded the outcome as a mandate for his policies.
   ``It gives me the confidence that I'm going to go forward the
way I think is correct here. ... And we're going to stay right on
track,'' Bush said.
   Defending the secrecy of his approach, Bush said, ``I think the
decisions I've made are good decisions.
   ``I can understand the controversy and I can understand why
there isn't unanimous endorsement,'' he said. ``But I view it as a
very good step.''
   Bush said the 40,000 Chinese students in the United States would
be fully protected even without the legislation. ``No student, as
long as I'm president, will be sent back against his or her will,''
he vowed.
   The president's victory followed an intense White House lobbying
blitz that included calls from Bush as well as former President
Richard M. Nixon.
   Bush discussed the China situation, as well as other subjects,
in a pair of news conference appearances Thursday at which he also
announced a $10.6 drug-fighting strategy and a $1 billion aid
package for Panama to rebuild after the American invasion last
month.
   On a major foreign policy front, Bush praised Mikhail S.
Gorbachev as the ``best hope'' for the United States in the Soviet
Union and declined to fault him for using force to restore order in
the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.
   ``I think we have a lot at stake in continuing to deal with this
man,'' Bush said. ``I want very much for him to succeed.''
   On other subjects, Bush said:
   _He would not point a finger at any party for the impasse in
Middle East peace talks, saying, ``I don't think it would be
helpful to quantify recalcitrance.'' He said the United States
would ``continue to be a catalyst'' to bring Israel, the
Palestinians and Egypt together.
   _He disagreed with NAACP leaders that there is ``a rising tide''
of racial violence in America, although he said there have been
``some very ugly incidents'' with recent bombings and other actions.
   _He will tell Americans in his State of the Union address next
Wednesday that ``the country is going to be in pretty good shape.''
   _He believes that members of Congress favor military base
cutbacks only if they don't affect their own regions. ``I was
guilty of the same thing when I was a member of Congress,'' Bush
said, adding that a strong economy is the best answer for helping
communities recover from base closings.
   He plans to submit a list of proposed base shutdowns to Congress
on Monday when he submits his fiscal 1991 budget.

   Progressives from the lower ranks of the Communist
Party are mounting an open challenge in the powerful Central
Committee, demanding a multiparty system and a virtual apology for
decades of totalitarian rule.
   For the first time in at least half a century, the party may be
facing two competing political platforms.
   Progressives, newly united by a program and an organization they
call the ``Democratic Platform,'' hope to force discussion of their
proposals at a meeting of the Central Committee Feb. 5-6, said
Mikhail V. Malyutin, one of the group's leaders.
   The Politburo led by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, wary of the
fall of Communist parties in Eastern Europe and stung by sharpening
criticism of its own failure to solve economic and ethnic crises,
is proposing its own program to the meeting.
   The Politburo platform calls for ``radical democratization of
the party,'' according to a Central Committee staffer who spoke on
condition of anonymity. Details are still secret, he said.
   The Central Committee meeting comes at a time when some
candidates for local elections are calling openly for a multiparty
system. Even Gorbachev two weeks ago dropped his unconditional
opposition.
   In the Baltics, other parties are already legalized or
tolerated. Lithuanian Communists expect to lose complete control of
their legislature in next month's election and be forced into the
first coalition government in the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet Communist Party lost about 160,000 members in
December when 80 percent of the Lithuanian party split off to form
an independent Communist Party. Thousands more were reported to
have quit in Azerbaijan this week in fury over Soviet troops'
attempt to halt ethnic and nationalist violence.
   The Central Committee staffer refused to reveal the decline in
membership but said, ``We want to stop this process. We need to
reform the party quickly.''
   The ``Democratic Platform'' adopted by the reformers last
weekend is much more blunt.
   ``If the healthy forces inside the Communist Party do not
succeed in carrying out deep-rooted democratic transformation, the
crisis inevitably will bring the party to political bankruptcy (as
in Poland) or to the iron fist (as in China),'' it said.
   More than 100 Soviet journalists covered the reformers' meeting
last weekend. Yet in a telling example of just how far they can go
in reporting severe criticism of the party, almost none have
reported on it.
   But Radio Moscow did, saying it would be ``written down in the
history of the Soviet Communist Party as a day when an event of
extraordinary importance took place.''
   ``A large group of Communists formed a platform within the
party, and declared its intention to work towards democratizing the
party ranks and introducing a multiparty political system,'' the
radio said.
   The platform was adopted last weekend at a conference of
delegates from more than 100 Communist clubs, representing 60,000
members from 78 cities. Also at the meeting were progressives from
the Inter-Regional Group of parliamentarians and reformers in the
party bureaucracy itself, such as Vyacheslav N. Shostakovsky,
rector of the Higher Party School for Communists.
   The reform group is trying to gain an audience with Gorbachev to
win a formal place on the agenda for its platform and to seek the
right to participate in the plenum, said Malyutin.
   In any case, Moscow legislator Boris Yeltsin is a member of the
Central Committee and he is expected to propose the platform.
   Many of the reformers have threatened to break away and form a
Social Democratic Party if their demands are not met. But others
argue that the Communist Party is still too powerful and the
reformers must fight for control of it.
   The Democratic Platform also calls for the party to ``recognize
the enormous responsibility carried by the Communist Party for the
results and consequences of the totalitarian regime in our
country.''
   It furthers demands ``complete and irreversible condemnation of
the model of government socialism which has brought our society to
deep crisis.''
   It calls for a multiparty system, supports more independence for
the republics, individual Communist parties for each republic, and
the transfer of power from the party to elected parliaments and
local councils.
   It demands an end to the upper class of bureaucrats who enjoy
special food, apartments, cars and other privileges, and election
of the delegates to the critically important party congress, now
scheduled for October.
   In the past, delegates have been approved by party leaders, who
thereby guaranteed their own hold on power.
   It is the last item that is most likely to win approval from the
Central Committee, still largely the province of hard-liners
because they were chosen at the last congress in 1986, when
Gorbachev had not yet consolidated his position.
   In fact, the Politburo platform also includes a new means of
electing delegates to the party congress that will reflect ``the
very radical feelings in the grass-roots level,'' said the Central
Committee staffer. He said he could not give details.
   Although much of the country still believes in old-fashioned
communism, those forces apparently suffered a defeat this week.
   Leningrad party chief Boris Gidaspov, seen as a likely leader of
a conservative counterattack against Gorbachev, withdrew his
candidacy for the city council after a poll of voters ranked him
9th on a list of 10 prominent figures, local journalists said.
   The official media also have been hinting at impending change.
The television news show ``Vremya'' on Sunday made an unusually
strong attack on privilege by showing a luxurious hunting lodge
frequented by high-ranking officials. It contrasted this with the
camp's cramped employee housing, which had no running water or
central heat.

   Vice President Dan Quayle departs today for
Latin America with a new mandate to carry details of President
Bush's $1 billion aid package to Panama.
   Quayle will go empty-handed, however, to another stop on his
three-day trip, Jamaica, where he likely will run into some
testiness about a $25 million cut in U.S. assistance.
   He will make those two stops after traveling to Honduras on
Saturday for the presidential inauguration there.
   He also plans discussions with five other presidents attending
the inauguration from Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica and
Venezuela.
   Bush is dispatching Quayle to talk to those leaders about the
widespread objections among the Latins to the Dec. 20 U.S. military
invasion of Panama.
   Quayle initially had hoped to visit some other countries but
faced resistance from Latin leaders simmering over the invasion.
Quayle aides, however, insisted the heads of state had no problem
with meeting with Quayle outside their own capitals at the Honduran
event.
   Bush, who earlier said he wanted Quayle to explain that he did
not undertake the invasion without a valid rationale, said Thursday
he thinks many of those nations now understand that.
   But he acknowledged there had been bruised feelings over what
the Latins saw as a violation of Panamanian sovereignty.
   ``Anytime you undertake an engagement like I authorized, you've
got to assess what the downside is because there is a history,''
Bush told reporters, apparently in reference to the
heavy-handedness the United States has exhibited toward Latin
countries in years past.
   Bush on Thursday announced a $1 billion aid package to help
Panama rebuild and revive its economy in the wake of the invasion.
Damage estimates have ranged as high as $2 billion, however.
   Bush said Quayle would discuss details of the package with the
U.S.-installed president of Panama, Guillermo Endara, during a stop
there on Sunday. Endara said he had asked the United States for $2
billion in aid.
   Administration officials said aid programs to other countries
will have to be cut to fund much of the Panama package. They said
Bush has not decided which countries, but one country apparently
designated to suffer is Jamaica.
   Jamaican officials have made it clear they are not happy that
they are to lose $25 million in economic support funds, one
administration official said.
   A Jamaican diplomat said the money is part of the $116 million
that was allocated in fiscal 1989 to Jamaica for food aid, economic
support and development assistance. The diplomat said Jamaican
officials have been informed the economic support, used in the past
for balance of payment support, will be zeroed out.
   Jamaica is one of the countries that joined the overwhelming
Organization of American States vote deploring the U.S. invasion.

<HEAD>Ag Department Sees Little Boost in Soybean Planting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Faced with a modest rise in stockpiles and
sharply lower market prices, soybean farmers will probably have
second thoughts about boosting acreages significantly this year,
according to Agriculture Department analysts.
   Although the department's estimates of 1990 planting intentions
are not due for release until March 20, a USDA report said Thursday
``market fundamentals suggest weaker incentives to plant soybeans''
will prevail.
   ``This year, like last, the government will allow farmers to
sign up to plant up to 25 percent of their program permitted
acreage to soybeans without reducing their historical base,'' the
report said. ``However, relatively low soybean prices are likely to
give scant encouragement to shifts from program crops (such as
corn) to soybeans.''
   Soybean prices in central Illinois are averaging $5.60 per
bushel this month, down from $7.22 last summer, the report said.
Prices tumbled by about 90 cents a bushel between July and August
when it was apparent the 1990 harvest would produce near-normal
yields.
   ``The larger 1989 crop is meeting strong domestic demand for
both soybean meal and oil, but (there is) weaker export demand for
soybean products,'' the report said.
   Soybean meal is in demand as a high-protein feed ingredient for
livestock, and oil is used in a wide variety of food and industrial
products.
   According to USDA projections, the soybean stockpile at the
start of the 1990-91 marketing year on Sept. 1 may be around 335
million bushels, nearly double the six-year low of 182 million
bushels last Sept. 1.
   Over the entire 1989-90 marketing year, soybeans are projected
to average in the range of $5.35 to $5.65 per bushel, compared with
$7.35 last season.
   The report said around 1.1 billion bushels of soybeans will be
crushed into meal and oil by processors this year, only slightly
more than in the 1988-89 marketing year.
   Soybean exports are expected to rise to 580 million bushels in
1989-90 from 527 million last year. That would still be far less
than the 802 million bushels exported in 1987-88. But export demand
for meal and oil is expected to decline.
   ``Domestic demand for soybean meal is forecast at a record 21.4
million tons this year, in part because of high feeding margins,
particularly for hogs and poultry,'' the report said.
   ``Furthermore,'' it added, ``soybean meal is extremely
price-competitive with other protein sources. Prices have fallen
below $200 a ton since summer and are expected to average $165 to
$185 in 1989-90.''
   Meal exports are forecast at only 4.9 million tons this season,
down from 5.1 million tons last year. The report said this is due
to ``intense South American competition.''

   An Agriculture Department scientist says the
1989 corn crop probably escaped the high levels of contamination by
aflatoxin, a natural cancer-causing chemical that plagued growers
in 1988.
   Microbiologist Donald T. Wicklow of the department's
Agricultural Research Service said the weather conditions necessary
for unusually high aflatoxin levels generally were not present on a
national scale last year. He said none has been reported since last
fall's harvest.
   Wicklow works for the agency's northern regional research center
in Peoria, Ill. His comments were released here Thursday by the
agency.
   Aflatoxin is a poisonous chemical produced by two soil fungi,
Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. Wicklow said A. flavus has
been found most commonly in peanuts and corn, especially in hot,
dry weather such as occurred in 1988.
   The agency said aflatoxin has been linked to cancer in
laboratory animals.
   Corn will not necessarily be contaminated simply because it was
grown in a field that previously produced aflatoxin-tainted corn,
Wicklow said. Corn will also not pick up aflatoxin from being
stored in bins that previously held tainted corn.
   Wicklow said concerns about aflatoxin often focus on the
Southeast, partly because of the region's typically hotter weather
during the period when corn is maturing.
   But he said statistics for 1988 show that of the four states _
North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida _ only North
Carolina produced as much as 1 percent of the U.S. corn crop, with
1.6 percent of the nation's harvest of 4.93 billion bushels.

   Catfish farmers marketed a record 341.9
million pounds last year, up 15 percent from 1988, an Agriculture
Department report shows.
   December marketings totaled 25.8 million pounds, up from 22.6
million a year earlier, the report said. Prices paid in December to
growers averaged 68 cents a pound, down 10 cents from the
year-earlier average.
   Farm-grown catfish prices were up from year-earlier levels
through the first five months of 1989 but then dropped as
production continued to rise.

   President Bush will propose $50 million in his
new budget to improve government statistics that affect Americans
from their wages to their Social Security benefits, the
administration's chief economic adviser says.
   Saying the government now spends ``four or five hundred
million'' dollars to gather economic statistics, Michael J. Boskin
told reporters Thursday the fiscal 1991 budget to be released on
Monday would contain a 10 percent increase for improvements in core
national statistics.
   Boskin, chairman of Bush's Council of Economic Advisers,
described the U.S. statistical system as among the finest in the
world. But he admitted ``serious problems remain ... especially in
those rapidly changing areas of the economy where accurate
information is most urgently needed.''
   Boskin heads a working group of the president's Economic Policy
Council that already has submitted 25 recommendations for changes
in various government statistics. The agencies are expected to
report in about three months how they expect to implement them.
   The government's statistical gathering system is important
because of its impact on the economy, Boskin said, giving as
examples such things as ``private orders and contracts,
cost-of-living adjustments, the federal budget and monetary
policy.''
   Boskin, a former stanford University economics professor, said
estimating changes in quality in many important sectors is the most
serious problem.
   ``When we as a nation produced mostly things like steel and
wheat, output was easy to count _ tons of steel and bushels of
wheat,'' he said.
   ``Today a larger share of output is in sectors where better
performance means quality and improved convenience,'' he continued.
``Consider the impact of 24-hour automatic teller machines, and the
changes in desktop and laptop computers.''
   Boskin cited price indexes that should adjust for quality change.
   ``When the Commerce Department recently introduced a new
computer price index that only partially adjusted for quality
change, it raised real GNP (gross national product) growth from 3.8
to 4.1 percent (a difference reaching $70 billion by 1988) and
lowered the rate in inflation (as measured by the GNP price
deflator) from 3.6 to 3.3 percent between 1982 and 1988,'' he said.
   Boskin also said the government's statistical system has not
kept up with changes in the economy. Airline deregulation, for
instance, produced lower fares and widespread discounting, causing
passenger miles to increase by over 60 percent in the 1980s, he
said.
   ``Yet the price index is still heavily based on full-fare
tickets, which now account for only 10 percent of tickets'' he
noted.
   And, he added, ``in some industries such as education and health
care, even defining the unit of output is difficult.''

<TEXT>
   Public officials accused of corruption
frequently hide behind a stone wall of silence, but here they've
built barricades to keep reporters out.
   It's not every day, though, that a city parks commissioner is
accused of deliberately polluting a lake.
   Buffalo's Parks Department scandal has grown in two months from
a relatively ordinary tale of accusations of kickbacks and
purchasing irregularities to encompass the mayor's broken lawnmower
and melted ice in a favorite skating lake.
   In the process, it is threatening to bring the government of New
York's second-largest city to a halt.
   City council members want to talk to Parks Commissioner Robert
E. Delano about the allegations and also about the ordinary
business of government.
   But he's stonewalling them.
   Delano and Mayor James D. Griffin could not be located for
comment Thursday. Delano has had no comment since the affair began.
Griffin's only response has been to lavishly praise Delano, his
longtime friend and handball partner, and to label complaining
parks workers ``stool pigeons.''
   ``If the parks commissioner can't talk in public to the Common
Council, it'll become almost impossible for us to manage the
affairs of the city,'' Majority Leader Eugene Fahey said. ``... We
have to prepare a city budget.'' But the prosecutor investigating
the scandals said his entire probe could fall apart if the council
subpoenas Delano because the parks boss could win immunity from
prosecution if he is compelled to talk to the council.
   ``Unfortunately, city government finds itself at an impasse,''
U.S. Attorney Dennis C. Vacco wrote in a letter to Fahey.
   ``I respectfully suggest that the public interest in a thorough
and orderly investigation into possible wrongdoing within the Parks
Department would at this time outweigh the public's interest in the
Common Council's efforts to perform its lawful role in the conduct
of city government.''
   The scandal began with allegations in November about private
work done by parks workers on city time, various forms of
favoritism and kickbacks, and purchasing irregularities.
   It exploded last week, when news reports quoted unidentified
parks workers as saying they had been ordered to pour brine into
Delaware Park Lake to keep it from freezing after the Common
Council took a lakeside refreshment stand concession away from
Delano's associates. Brine is a saturated salt solution.
   The melted ice struck a nerve because the lake, the centerpiece
of the Frederick Law Olmsted park that officials call ``Buffalo's
jewel,'' had just been cleaned of pollution at a cost of $12
million.
   ``Here's the guy who's supposed to protect our lakes, and he's
giving orders to his men to pollute it,'' said Councilman Alfred T.
Coppola, whose district includes the park. ``That's what's crazy
about the whole thing.''
   When the council asked Delano for an explanation on Tuesday, he
refused to appear.
   On the same day, the 3{-foot-high wooden barricade went up at
the entrance to Delano's office suite. One worker told The
Associated Press that the barricade was erected because toxic
chemicals were stored in the building, but another told a
television reporter that it was ``to keep you guys out.''
   Griffin was linked to the scandal for the first time on Thursday
by unidentified parks workers who told The Buffalo News that they
had repaired the mayor's lawnmower and boat engine on city time, in
a city shop, using city materials.
   More tips of alleged wrongdoing are coming in every day, Coppola
said. He showed reporters an anonymous letter he had received
urging him to ``Check the fence purchases against their work
orders.''
   ``Each day gets worse. Not only the city's image is at stake,
we've got a whole department in turmoil,'' Coppola said.

<HEAD>Bush Urged to Withdraw Nominee for Nuclear Waste Czar</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Richard Bryan of Nevada is urging
President Bush to withdraw his nominee to head the Energy
Department's long-delayed search for a site to build the nation's
first high-level nuclear waste dump.
   Bryan, a Democrat and a staunch opponent of the department's
study of Nevada's Yucca Mountain as a candidate for the waste dump,
said Thursday that Bush's nominee was ``blatantly biased'' against
Nevada's legal battle to stop the project.
   The nomination of John W. Bartlett to be director of the
department's office of civilian radioactive waste management was
sent to Congress on Wednesday. The department has been without a
permanent waste czar for more than two years.
   The Justice Department on Thursday carried out Energy Secretary
James D. Watkins's vow to sue Nevada for refusing to issue
environmental permits needed to pursue scientific studies at Yucca
Mountain, a desert site about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   Nevada sued Watkins last month in federal court in San Francisco
seeking to force a halt to the project.
   Watkins said Thursday he felt compelled to take legal action
against Nevada because the state has delayed action on the
environmental permits for more than two years.
   ``I have no alternative but to turn to the federal courts to
break this logjam,'' he said in a statement. He noted that even if
all obstacles to the project are removed and Yucca Mountain proves
scientifically sound, a waste dump could not open before 2010. It
originally was to open in 1998.
   Bryan said Bartlett ``is totally unqualified for this critical
post. Bartlett said we need to throw out scientific research and
base the decision to site a nuke dump on pure `judgment.''' Bryan
urged Bush to ``begin a new search for a fair candidate.''
   No date for Bartlett's confirmation hearing has been set.
   Bartlett began working for the Energy Department as a consultant
last Nov. 7 after leaving The Analytic Sciences Corp., an
engineering contractor to several government agencies, including
the Energy Department. Bartlett worked there for 10 years and was
manager of nuclear technology at an annual salary of $133,806 when
he quit, according to financial disclosure records on file at the
department.
   Bartlett and his company were paid consultants to the electric
utility trade group Edison Electric Institute and the industry's
research arm, the Electric Power Research Institute, the financial
records show.
   The Energy Department said Bartlett was not available for
comment Thursday.
   Craig Varoga, a spokesman for Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said Reid
was unhappy with the Bartlett nomination but had not decided
whether to oppose his confirmation.

   You've seen ``Top Gun'' more than once.
You crave the thrill of streaking across the sky on the enemy's
tail, targeting their fighter jet, making the kill. Savoring the
victory.
   But you've never flown a plane.
   Welcome to Air Combat USA where, for $495, anyone _ would-be Red
Barons or combat veterans nostalgic for the past _ can take
Italian-made propeller aircraft up for dogfights over peacetime
Southern California.
   ``It takes nothing but a desire to get into the airplane,'' said
Greg Sloan, one of eight pilots who fly with Air Combat customers
in the dual-control planes.
   The 2-year-old enterprise, started by commercial airline pilot
Mike Blackstone, has pitted friend against friend, son against
father, spouse against spouse.
   ``We've had everything from high school students to 50th wedding
anniversary husband-and-wife air combat,'' said Blackstone. In that
encounter, he said, ``The woman shot him down over and over again.''
   The one-day fighter fantasy includes an hour of ground school,
an hour of flying and a debriefing. There's also a keepsake: A
videotape of the adventure made by a cockpit camera.
   Customers take the adventure as far as courage, and their
instructor, will allow. They can perform a ballet of rolling
scissors, high and low yo-yos, lag rolls and loops in pursuit of
their opponent.
   The so-called ``kills,'' simulated by a trail of smoke emitted
by the victim aircraft, are verified by a tracking system developed
by Blackstone, an aeronautical engineer.
   The invention was spurred by a friendly rivalry with pilot Bill
Bancroft, who helped him get the business going. Now arguments over
whether a kill was good are settled electronically _ followed by
triumphant shouts of ``Yeeehaawww!''
   Air Combat's three planes, decked out in Navy stripings or the
markings of a gray Russian MIG, fly out of Fullerton Airport 25
miles south of downtown Los Angeles.
   The missions take place over unpopulated areas, outside of
federal airways and above 1,500 feet, as required by Federal
Aviation Administration regulations, Blackstone said. The planes
remain 500 feet apart.
   He doesn't dismiss questions about safety.
   ``There's always danger _ it's flying,'' Blackstone said. ``This
is Southern California, and there's a lot of airplanes. But we fly
only on good visibility days and maintain a vigil for other
aircraft at all times. When we spot one, we stop the flight.''
   Air Combat has had no accidents, he said.
   Sloan, a 20-year Marine veteran who flew nearly 300 missions in
Vietnam, said he isn't nervous about his novice charges: ``I've
been instructing air combat maneuvers since 1973. There's nothing
they can do that I haven't seen. I'm having as much fun now as I
did then.''
   The Marchetti SF-260 aircraft have a top cruising speed of 250
mph.
   The pilots can be surprised by human nature, however: the man
who begs them to turn back right after takeoff, or the woman who
relishes every bit of G-force as she repeatedly bests a pilot with
1,500 hours of flight time.
   Business has boomed in the six months since Blackstone installed
his kill tracking system in Air Combat's three planes. Sloan said
the company has more than 700 bookings.
   ``There are former fighter pilots from Vietnam to World War II
coming out to relive their experiences,'' Sloan said. ``We've had
people fly in from Scandinavia to Tokyo.''
   The Air Combat pilots downplay the connection to the Tom Cruise
movie ``Top Gun,'' which focused on the Miramar Naval Air Station's
Fighter Weapons School, popularly known as Top Gun, in San Diego.
   ``The draw we get is from the actual fact they can fly the
airplane,'' Sloan said. ``Safety is the prime directive _ and fun
next.''

   Lebanon's defiant Christian leader Michel Aoun
is asking a U.S. court to stop the United States from evicting his
ambassador in Washington.
   Aoun's lawsuit against Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is being heard today by U.S.
District Court Judge Harold Greene.
   The petition claims the U.S. government plans to evict Abdallah
Bouhabib, who served as Lebanon's ambassador here until Dec. 11,
from the Lebanese Embassy and from his residence.
   Bouhabib, who also is a plaintiff in the case, was removed from
his post by Lebanon's new government led by Syrian-backed President
Elias Hrawi. The United States extended diplomatic recognition to
Bouhabib's successor named by the Hrawi government.
   However, Aoun does not recognize the Hrawi government and has
ordered Bouhabib to refuse to relinquish his post. Bouhabib locked
the embassy and has refused entry to the employees.
   Hrawi sent an envoy to Washington 10 days ago to seek the State
Department's help. The envoy empowered the State Department to lift
Bouhabib's diplomatic immunity, a source said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   By lifting his immunity, the State Department would have cleared
the way for Bouhabib's eviction.
   ``Plaintiffs have learned from unofficial sources that the
defendants, presumably at the request of the current rival regime
... intend forcibly to enter the embassy premises and forcibly to
eject Mr. Bouhabib,'' according to court papers filed in the case.
   ``Such a violation of the premises of a foreign mission would
violate bedrock principles of international law and the rights of
Lebanon under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Security,''
according to the petition.
   But the government argues in the case that under the Vienna
Convention it has a duty to protect the rights of the Lebanese
government which it recognizes.
   Hrawi was elected president by the Lebanese Parliament in
November with the backing of the 22-nation Arab League. Aoun
contends the election was not valid.
   Aoun, who was named Lebanon's prime minister in 1988, has
refused to relinquish his job and is holding out at the
presidential palace in Beirut with thousands of supporters.
   ``The government of Prime Minister Aoun controls a significant
portion of Lebanese territory, including a population of
approximately 1 million citizens,'' the plaintiffs argued.
   Brady was cited in the suit because the Treasury Department
oversees the Secret Service, whose function it is to protect
embassies.

   With the Bush administration struggling to
respond to the upheaval in the Soviet bloc, Sovietologists are
debating the identity of ``Z,'' the mysterious author of an article
arguing that Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms are doomed.
   ``The speculation this week centers on Martin Malia,'' a
little-known intellectual historian at the University of California
at Berkeley, said Harley Balzer, director of the Russian Area
Studies Program at Georgetown University.
   The controversial article, which appeared in Daedalus, published
by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, recalled one written
at the dawn of the Cold War by a senior administration official
outlining the policy of containment that guided U.S. policy toward
Moscow for the next three decades.
   George Kennan, who at the time was head of policy planning at
the State Department, published the earlier pseudonymous article in
the influential magazine ``Foreign Affairs,'' but his identity was
soon discovered.
   The new ``Z'' article said Gorbachev was pursuing only halfway
measures that would not reform the Soviet Union, which labors under
the twin burdens of centuries of Russian authoritarianism and 70
years of communist totalitarianism.
   Such pessimism flies in the face of the official optimism
expressed Thursday by President Bush.
   ``I want very much for him to succeed,'' Bush said, calling
Gorbachev the ``best hope'' for the United States in the Soviet
Union.
   Earlier guesses at the identity of ``Z'' included Zbigniew
Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger, the foreign policy gurus of
previous administrations; Robert Gates, the former No. 2 CIA chief
who works at the White House; and retired Lt. Gen. William Odom,
former head of the supersecret National Security Agency.
   All four men hold doctorates in Soviet studies or related fields
and have expressed doubt over Gorbachev's prospects of success.
   All four either have denied authorship or refused to comment.
And scholars who have scrutinized the text say it does not reflect
the style of any of the most prominent candidates.
   Stephen R. Graubard, editor of Daedalus, refused to comment on
the identity of the author, saying he agreed to keep it secret
``for compelling reasons.''
   The mystery has heightened interest in Daedalus, which devoted
the entire winter issue to the turmoil in Eastern Europe.
   Malia, a specialist on 19th century Russian intellectual
history, could not be reached through the day Thursday at his home
or office, and he was quoted in the Financial Times of London as
denying authorship.
   A colleague of Malia's at Berkeley, historian Nicholas
Riasanovsky, said he doubted Malia was the author, adding,
``Professor Malia has a distinctive and distinguished style, but
this is not it.''
   Malia's previous work includes a book on Aleksandr Hertzen, a
19th century Russian intellectual credited with inspiring
generations of revolutionaries.
   Balzer of Georgetown said Malia ``is known only to historians,
like myself.''
   A well-placed administration source and expert in Soviet affairs
said, ``Malia is a good guess.''
   ``No one in the U.S. government I know could write that,'' said
the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``It's too scholarly. No one in government would write it
because the mindset is that of an historian, or someone trying to
analyze the problem from a distance and not trying to propose a
solution, the way someone in government would,'' he said.
   The article says that ``it is clear that 1989 will enter history
as the beginning of communism's terminal crisis, and not just in
Russia but from the Baltic to the China Sea, and from Berlin to
Beijing.''
   ``It is also clear that perestroika and glasnost, welcome in
their intention, have in their application only aggravated the
systemic crisis they were intended to alleviate. They have done so
because, like all forms of soft communism, they go against the
logic of the system they are trying to save,'' it said.
   ``Mikhail Gorbachev has been trying to promote soft communism
through structures and a population programmed for hard communism.
But the latter is the only variety of Sovietism that is the genuine
article, for the essence of all varieties of Sovietism is party
supremacy. Thus, the instrument of Mr. Gorbachev's reform _ the
party _ is the basic cause of Sovietism's troubles,'' it said.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Support for Government Long-Term Care Coverage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of Americans favor a federal
long-term program that would cover the high costs of nursing home
care through a plan similar to Social Security, according to a
private study released today.
   The study, commissioned by the American Association of Retired
Persons, found a majority of people of all ages would be willing to
pay $50 a month for a long-term care package that offers nursing
home protection for all Americans.
   The report was prepared by the Daniel Yankelovich Group research
company, based on a survey of 1,490 Americans ages 18 and older.
Those surveyed identified coverage of nursing home costs as the
most important part of any long-term care package, with home care
benefits seen as less important.
   Sixty-seven percent of those surveyed expressed strong support
for a federal program, with the level of support fairly consistent
among different age groups in the sample.
   The study also found a need for more public education about
long-term care. Thirty-three percent of older Americans incorrectly
thought long-term care costs were covered by Medicare, which pays
for less than 2 percent of the nation's nursing home expenditures.
   Nursing home costs average more than $20,000 a year, with
roughly half paid for directly by individuals and the other half by
the government, mainly through Medicaid, the welfare program for
the poor.
   Medicaid coverage of nursing home costs is available once people
exhaust most of their private resources, with eligibility standards
varying from state to state. The fledgling market for private
nursing long-term care insurance has grown in recent years, with
about 1.3 million policies sold by mid-1989.

<HEAD>CDC Researchers Say Flu at Epidemic Levels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A flu epidemic has hit the United States with
outbreaks reported this winter ``just about everywhere,'' a Centers
for Disease Control researcher said.
   A key indicator _ a deaths-from-flu index _ is at its highest
level in at least eight years, CDC researchers said Thursday.
   Flu is reported ``widespread'' in 18 states and ``regional''
outbreaks are reported in 17 more states, the CDC said in its
weekly report.
   Last week, 7.6 percent of 15,090 deaths reported to the CDC from
121 major cities were blamed on flu or pneumonia.
   That ``significantly exceeds'' expected levels for the second
straight week, said Dr. Walter Gunn, a CDC viral disease specialist.
   ``This qualifies in our definition as an epidemic,'' Gunn said.
   The CDC's epidemic level is 6.7 percent. The 7.6 percent figure
is the worst since the winter of 1981-82, Gunn said.
   Most of the flu samples reported to the CDC this winter have
been the type which researchers call A-H3N2. That was the
predominant type in the 1984-85 flu season, when an estimated
57,000 Americans died from flu _ 37,000 more than in the typical
winter, Gunn said.
   ``As far as how many people will die'' this flu season, ``that
depends on how long this peak is sustained,'' Gunn said. ``With any
luck, it will come right back down.''
   Flu has been reported this winter ``just about everywhere,''
Gunn said.
   The serious flu season, he said, points to the importance of flu
vaccinations for those at greatest risk of serious complications
from flu, including older people and patients with heart or lung
disease.
   ``There's still time,'' he said. ``It only takes two weeks to
build up your immunity.''
   Gunn also stressed that parents whose children or teen-agers
have flu symptoms should be careful not to treat them with aspirin,
which has been linked in flu cases to Reye's syndrome, a rare but
potentially deadly disease.

<TEXT>
   Spain's first private TV station to begin
regular programming broke the state's 33-year monopoly with a
newscast that immediately took the government to task.
   Antena 3 de Television is one of three private companies that
gained a license in August from the government of Socialist Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
   During the first broadcast Thursday, beamed only to Madrid and
Barcelona, announcer Miguel Angel Nieto wasted little time in
showing the new station will follow the strongly anti-government
line of its national radio network.
   ``We cannot ask your forgiveness for not appearing in all of
Spain,'' Nieto said. ``The government simply will not let us.''
   Antena 3 and the other two private stations, all legally
required to begin regular programming by April 3, are broadcast
through a state-owned telecommunications network, which officials
say is to cover the entire country by late 1991.
   Parliament voted to create three private stations in 1988. Until
Thursday, most Spaniards received three channels, two run by the
Spanish government and a third run by their regional government.

   A new report showing an upsurge in television
violence on kids' shows could give a boost to a congressional move
to curb violent programming, say the bill's sponsors.
   Children's weekend daytime programs contained more than 25 acts
of violence per hour in each of the last three seasons, many of
them set in a ``humorous'' context, said the study by University of
Pennsylvania and University of Delaware researchers released
Thursday.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., a sponsor of legislation limit the
television violence, joined Rep. Dan Glickman, R-Kan., to release
the study and say it shows how important the bill is.
   The bill to grant an antitrust exemption to the TV industry to
address the issue is mired in a House-Senate committee.
   Several network officials have said the bill is not necessary.
The bill contains no sanctions, but would reflect ``a clear message
from Congress that we're dissatisfied,'' Simon said at a press
conference.
   Simon, who first introduced the legislation five years ago, said
the report could help ``boost prospects'' for final congressional
action. He first introduced the measure five years ago.
   The study traced the rise of kids' TV violence to broadcast
deregulation of the early 1980s.
   ``The most significant difference seems to be the dismantling of
codes pertaining to violence during children's programming,'' the
study said. It said the rate for violent acts during weekend
daytime children's programs was 18.6 per hour before 1980, and 26.4
acts per hour after 1980.
   ``Violence essentially demonstrates who can dominate or
terrorize whom, and humor is the sugar coating on the pill,'' said
George Gerbner, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's
Annenberg School for Communication and an author of the study.
   The study tracked TV violence occurring in a realistic or
humorous context, but does not count verbal abuse. It said exposure
``cultivates a sense of relative insecurity, vulnerability and
mistrust.''
   Violence on prime time seems to have stabilized, Gerbner said.
About half of all major characters are involved in violence and 10
percent in killing, as they have been since the first ``violence
profile'' was prepared at the Annenberg School in 1967, he said.
There were 5.9 violent acts per prime time hour in 1967, compared
with 6.2 in 1988.
   The study addressed the three major networks. Cable television
was not included.
   The House voted in August to give television networks, local
stations, producers and the Cable TV industry a three-year
antitrust exemption to formulate guidelines for depicting non-news
violence on television. Currently, such discussions would violate
the Sherman Antitrust Act.
   The Senate version of the bill was approved last May with an
amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., that would also allow the TV
industry to discuss ways to curb scenes that glorify drug use and
portray sexually explicit material.
   A House-Senate conference committee has yet to begin working on
the final bill.
   The Helms amendment ``is a sticking point. My hope is we can get
a compromise,'' Simon said. He said the industry-wide guidelines
made possible by the bill ``can begin at least to reverse the trend
toward violence.''

   Offers of donations poured in after the family of
Carol Stuart announced a scholarship fund in her memory to aid
residents of the inner-city neighborhood where she was fatally shot.
   Giusto and Evelyn DiMaiti announced the fund Thursday in their
first appearance before reporters since they learned that their
son-in-law apparently plotted their daughter's slaying.
   The DiMaiti family said they want their daughter to be
remembered as more than just the victim of a sensational killing.
They also said they hope to begin a healing process in the Mission
Hill neighborhood where she was fatally shot Oct. 23 in an
elaborate hoax.
   More than 40 people telephoned the family's lawyer immediately
after the televised news conference, offering to donate money to
the Carol DiMaiti Stuart Foundation Inc.
   Giusto DiMaiti, 64, who stood up to read a brief statement to
reporters, choked up during the end of his remarks.
   ``She was truly the brightest of lights in our lives,'' said
DiMaiti, who was flanked by his 62-year-old wife and 37-year-old
son Carl. ``She will always and forever be with us. ... Mere words
cannot express the emptiness we feel or how much we miss her now
and will miss her for the rest of our lives.''
   Mrs. DiMaiti, who dabbed at her eyes throughout the news
conference, and Carl DiMaiti, did not comment.
   The scholarship fund has been established for residents of
Mission Hill, the area where a manhunt was launched after Charles
Stuart told police that a black mugger had shot him and his wife.
   The case drew wide attention and the badly wounded Stuart's
dramatic call for help on his car telephone was broadcast
nationally. His wife died hours later. Their son lived just 17 days
after being delivered by Caesarean section. Ten weeks after the
shootings, Stuart apparently committed suicide after one of his
brothers implicated him in the shootings.
   In announcing the scholarship, attorney Marvin Geller recalled
the ``old scars of racial tension'' opened by the hoax.
   ``The DiMaiti family believes that Carol would not have wanted
her death to be remembered as the cause of such divisiveness,'' he
said.
   Black community leaders in Boston applauded the announcement but
tempered their remarks with lingering concerns about the damage
done Mission Hill's residents.
   ``I think it's a magnanimous gesture on their part,'' said Louis
Elisa, president of the Boston chapter of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People. ``Given what they had to
suffer from the cruel hoax, without proper protection from the
city. Maybe they can prevail on the mayor to make an apology so the
real healing can start.''
   In a less conciliatory development, black state legislators
announced a bill Thursday that would establish a special commission
to investigate police work in the case.
   The commission, which would have limited subpoena power, would
examine how police built a case against William Bennett, a black
man who has since been exonerated. The panel also would try to
determine where the media got information about Bennett.

<HEAD>First Lady Launches Drive for $25 Million White House Endowment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush, saying the White House holds ``a
special place in the hearts of Americans,'' is asking them to find
$25 million in their pocketbooks for the executive mansion.
   Mrs. Bush on Thursday announced the start of a private
fund-raising drive to raise an endowment for the famed public rooms
of the mansion where every American president except George
Washington has lived.
   The goal is to raise the money over the next three years to
provide for future refurbishing and improvements of the State
Dining Room, East Room, Blue Room and other salons that draw tens
of thousands of visitors each year.
   The first lady said there is nothing crying out for repair or
replacement right now but a $25 million endowment would help ensure
for all time ``the best care and upkeep of all (the) splendid
public rooms.''
   Former first lady Nancy Reagan refurbished the family quarters
of the White House with privately raised moneys and helped win
accredited museum status for the public rooms of the mansion. The
endowment would only go for the upkeep of those public rooms.
   The money will be raised by a new White House Endowment Fund, an
offshoot of the White House Historical Association founded during
the Kennedy era. Spearheading the drive will be an old friend of
the Bushes from Midland, Texas, Dorothy M. Craig.
   ``Some of my friends at home think I'm going to redecorate the
White House. That is not the case,'' she told reporters. ``I'm
simply a fund-raiser.''
   ``We are starting from scratch,'' said Mrs. Craig, a
professional volunteer whose husband, Earle M. Craig Jr., is a
retired oilman.
   Ms. Bush, announcing the membership of the new Endowment Fund,
called the announcement of the fund-raising drive cause for ``a
celebration ... for this splendid house.''
   ``Throughout our history the White House has always held a
special place in the hearts of Americans, even those 19th century
miscreants who cut little pieces of the curtains as souvenirs,''
Mrs. Bush said.
   The drive was announced in the State Dining Room with several
dozen members of the Historical Association, the new Endowment Fund
and an existing Committee for the Preservation of the White House
on hand, including former Kennedy and Johnson administration
Cabinet member Clark Clifford.
   ``As Clark Clifford told me, Jackie Kennedy said the White House
should be the first house in the land, and that's what we're hoping
to keep it,'' Mrs. Bush told reporters.
   The move comes 12 years after an attempt during the Carter
administration to raise a $20 million preservation fund failed.
   Over the years money has been raised privately from benefactors
to buy furniture, paintings and other items for the executive
mansion. Just this week the White House announced installation of a
new rug, drapes and other furnishings in the Oval Office at a cost
of $62,000.
   Mrs. Craig has participated in past preservation efforts at the
White House, and helped raise about $200,000 for refurbishing of
the vice presidential mansion when the Bushes lived there. She also
played a role in raising funds for the new Oval Office rug.

   Agreement is nearly unanimous that goals
should be set on what students should know during their school
years, but officials say there are numerous problems in developing
standards that cut across the entire nation.
   Mike Cohen, education director of the National Governors'
Association, told a public forum Thursday the governors are
frustrated on several issues as they put together national
education goals.
   ``A couple of issues we've been wrestling with (deal) with the
conception of national standards,'' said Cohen, explaining the
governors haven't decided whether to set fixed standards nationally
or set various targets for student performance.
   Cohen said targets could be set, for example, for top performing
students, average students and low-achieving students with the idea
of ``moving more people forward.''
   Another issue is how to set national goals that will complement
statewide and local standards.
   ``We want to set goals in such a way ... that they give every
state and city an opportunity to be successful. How you do that is
not entirely clear,'' he said.
   Recent Gallup polls indicate most Americans want national
standards, national tests and a national curriculum.
   Cohen spoke to the governing board of the National Assessment of
Educational Progress, a federal testing program that periodically
samples what American children know _ popularly known as the
Nation's Report Card.
   The congressionally mandated board decided in December to
establish national tests graded on standards of what children
should know by grades four, eight and 12. The grade-level goals
will ``represent solid academic performance, not minimum skills,''
the panel agreed.
   The panel approved a recommendation for single standards for the
fourth and eighth grades and that two standards be used for the
final year of high school _ one measuring satisfactory performance
goals and another for goals tied to college-level courses.
   Panel Chairman Chester Finn said the board's efforts would
complement the president and governors national goals, slated to be
approved at the NGA's February meeting.
   ``These goals by no means span the whole curriculum,'' said
Finn. ``They certainly do not prescribe how major subjects should
be taught. Indeed, by setting outcome goals rather than detailed
procedures for teaching, we wish to encourage the initiative of
schools and teachers, of local school boards and state in devising
different means to reach common ends.''
   Several people, including American Federation of Teachers
President Albert Shanker, urged the board to move slowly in setting
the goals.
   ``We're so close ... it would be a damn shame if we don't do it
right,'' said Shanker.

Adams County District Court.
   Brown, his wife, and another couple were arrested Aug. 18 after
a bullet-punctuated chase through this south-central Nebraska town
of 5,600.
   The shootout came about eight hours after the women swooped into
the Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility near Ordway, Colo., in a
hijacked helicopter and carried the men away. The four landed and
transferred to a rented truck, and were finally caught in Holdrege,
about 400 miles from the medium-security prison.
   Brown was wounded in the hand in the gun battle.
   In return for Brown's no-contest plea, the prosecution dropped
charges of use of a firearm to commit a felony and being a felon in
possession of a firearm.
   Phelps District Court Judge Stephen Illingworth ordered a
pre-sentence investigation and scheduled sentencing for Feb. 9.
   Brown faces several charges in Colorado, including escape.
   Brown's wife, Rebecca L. Brown, 26, pleaded no contest earlier
this month in Phelps County to charges of using a firearm to commit
a felony and resisting arrest. She is awaiting sentencing.
   The other couple, Fedrico Gonzales, 21, and his wife, Patricia
Gonzales, 41, reached plea agreements last fall. Gonzales pleaded
guilty to being an accessory to a felony and was sentenced to 20
months to five years in prison. Mrs. Gonzales pleaded no contest to
being an accessory to a felony and was sentenced to one to three
years in prison.

<HEAD>Sources Say Barry Made Sexual Advances to Woman Before Arrest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry made repeated sexual
advances to the woman reported to have helped the FBI lure him into
a cocaine trap, law enforcement sources say.
   Barry, whom the FBI says it videotaped buying and smoking crack
cocaine, repeatedly asked Rasheeda Moore to make love during the
visit last week to her hotel room that ended in his arrest on a
misdemeanor drug possession charge, the sources said Thursday.
   Barry kissed and touched Rasheeda Moore, but the former model
rebuffed his advances, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   FBI agents used a surveillance camera to watch Barry purchase
crack cocaine and smoke the illegal drug during the 45-minute visit
to Ms. Moore's hotel room on Jan. 18, according to an affidavit
filed in the case.
   Ms. Moore's refusal to have sex with the mayor was in accordance
with instructions she received before the undercover sting began,
sources said.
   She also was told to let the mayor suggest any drug use to avoid
a defense claim he was entrapped. Ms. Moore was told not to use
drugs, the sources said.
   Barry, who this week checked into a Florida drug rehabilitation
clinic after turning over his mayoral duties to the city
administrator, conducted city business on the telephone in Ms.
Moore's room, said one source.
   Ms. Moore, a former model who has posed in national magazines,
had a longstanding romantic relationship with Barry that included
frequent cocaine use, law enforcement sources say.
   She agreed to cooperate with the FBI's year-long investigation
of Barry's alleged drug use following her arrest Jan. 1 in North
Hollywood, Calif., on a driving while intoxicated charge.
   Local police turned her over to the FBI, which had lodged a
``material witness warrant,'' authorities in California said.
   Ms. Moore's cooperation began after she was confronted with her
sworn denials to a federal grand jury last spring of allegations
she used drugs with the mayor, sources said.
   Ms. Moore, 38, has since told investigators about using cocaine
with Barry, an account that conflicts with the mayor's sworn denial
to a federal grand jury last year of allegations he used illegal
drugs, the sources said.
   Her account corroborates those provided by convicted drug dealer
Charles Lewis, who has testified that he sold crack cocaine to the
mayor and smoked it with him, sources said.
   Lewis, who had known Ms. Moore only by the initials ``R.C.,''
told investigators she was present when he and the mayor used drugs
during a March 1988 weekend in the Virgin Islands, sources said.
   Lewis identified Ms. Moore in a photograph after he began
cooperating with the investigation, one source said.
   Prosecutors are trying to piece together a perjury case against
Barry, according to law enforcement sources.
   The grand jury has called additional witnesses, including four
members of the mayor's around-the-clock security detail, said law
enforcement and city government sources.
   The investigation includes possible obstruction of justice by
police assigned to guard the mayor, one source said.
   A native of the nation's capital, Ms. Moore attended modeling
school here. In 1987 and 1988 she was employed as a social worker
for the District of Columbia government.

<HEAD>Fed Chairman Warns Congress Against Tax Moves on Foreign Investors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
acknowledges foreigners are not paying the full taxes owed on their
U.S. investments but he's cautioning Congress not to tinker with
the law.
   ``It's a tricky tradeoff ... to the extent it would divert to
other countries'' foreign money financing both the U.S.
government's budget deficit and private investment, Greenspan told
the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday.
   Until the United States became dependent on foreign investment
in the early 1980s, the government withheld a portion of the taxes
owed on interest payments to foreigners on their U.S. bank
deposits, Treasury securities and private bonds and notes.
   Greenspan admitted there is a ``dilemma'' in trying to collect
taxes from foreigners without driving their investments elsewhere.
   However, he nodded agreement when asked by Rep. Jim Moody,
D-Wis., if a study was needed to measure the ``sensitivity''
foreign investors would have to various possible withholding rates.
   That prompted the Bush administration to issue a statement
through the Treasury Department saying it opposes any attempt to
remove the exemption on withholding taxes for foreign investors.
   The congressional Joint Commission on Taxation has estimated
that just a 5 percent withholding tax on portfolio interest to
foreigners would raise $300 million a year in new revenues.
   ``We're so dependent on the torrential flow from abroad that we
can't even consider withholding a third of a billion dollars in
duly owed taxes because we're afraid the tax dodgers will roll
their money someplace else,'' Moody said.
   Greenspan said the United States remains heavily dependent on an
``inflow of savings from abroad ... to finance both the gaping
budget deficit and growing private investment in the face of a
declining private savings rate.''
   ``If we did not have that foreign investment, we would be
looking toward a significant slowing and perhaps a stagnation of
living standards,'' he added.
   However, he acknowledged the dependence is putting ``substantial
upward pressure on U.S. interest rates,'' particularly when rates
in other countries rise, as they have in Japan and West Germany in
recent days.
   ``The United States has become more vulnerable to disturbances
originating outside its borders,'' Greenspan said. But he said any
effort ``to insulate'' the country from what he called an
increasing globalization of capital markets ``could be very costly
to our standard of living.''
   Several members of the committee expressed fears the recent
surge in interest rates abroad could trigger a recession or
depression. ``What's the flash point that might worry you the
most?'' asked Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich.
   ``I don't even dare answer a question like that,'' the Fed
chairman replied. ``We worry about everything.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. health researchers say the nation's tetanus
rate has dropped 20-fold in four decades, to the point where the
disease now strikes only about 50 Americans a year.
   Fifty-three tetanus cases were reported in 1988, five more than
in 1987, the Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday. The
unofficial total for 1989 was 47 cases.
   The nation's tetanus rate, 39 cases per million people when
tetanus records began in 1947, was 2 per million by 1988, the CDC
said. The decline in tetanus ``has resulted from the widespread use
of tetanus toxoid'' since the mid-1940s, coupled with improved
techniques for treating wounds, CDC researchers said.
   Most cases occur when tetanus bacteria enter the body through an
unclean wound.
   ``In the United States, tetanus is primarily a disease of older
adults,'' the CDC said. Detailed information was available on 99 of
the 101 cases reported in 1987-88; 67 of those patients were 50 or
older.
   ``Tetanus immunization efforts should be especially emphasized''
for people 50 and over, the CDC said.
   The CDC said tetanus vaccine is ``highly effective'' if given
according to the recommended schedule: three doses in the primary
series, usually given to children, and booster shots every 10 years.
   Five of the 99 patients studied in 1987-88 had received primary
tetanus shots. Two had received their latest doses more than five
years before they became ill, one had his last dose more than 20
years earlier, and for the other two, it was unknown when their
last dose was.
   Only ``an extremely small number'' of vaccine failures occur,
said Dr. Peter Strebel, a CDC immunization specialist. Otherwise,
the disease is considered preventable.

<HEAD>Republican to House: Brace for Expulsion Vote if Lukens Loses
Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Republican congressman is warning House
members to brace themselves for ``the unenviable task of voting on
the expulsion of Barney Frank and Buz Lukens.''
   Rep. William Dannemeyer of California said he plans to force an
on-the-record expulsion vote if Rep. Donald Lukens, R-Ohio, loses
his appeal of a sex-related conviction, and plans to seek an
expulsion vote on Frank if the House Ethics Committee recommends
lesser action against the Massachusetts Democrat.
   Frank, an acknowledged homosexual, is being investigated because
of allegations he knew about a prostitution business being run from
his home and that he engaged in sexual activity in the House
gymnasium.
   ``All members should expect a vote on expulsion of Mr. Frank and
Mr. Lukens at any time,'' Dannemeyer said in a letter sent to
fellow House members. ``A recorded vote on expulsion, in one form
or another, will occur ... Members should be prepared.''
   Frank spokesman Doug Cahn said the Dannemeyer letter was
``simply a recast of what he said last fall.''
   ``Barney is confident to leave this matter in the hands of the
House Ethics Committee,'' he said.
   William Jarrell, Lukens' chief of staff, said, ``No comment.''
   Dannemeyer's press secretary, Paul Mero, provided a copy of the
letter on request Thursday but said the congressman did not wish to
discuss it. ``We're pretty much just waiting for the (ethics)
committee report to come out,'' he said.
   The 10th Ohio District Court of Appeals is considering the case
of Lukens, who was convicted in May of a misdemeanor, contributing
to the unruliness of a minor, for having sex with a 16-year-old
girl. He has been sentenced to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine, but
is free on bond.
   The girl had charged that Lukens knew she was underage when he
paid her to have sex at his Columbus apartment in 1988.
   Lukens, who did not testify at the trial, denied the
allegations, but after his conviction fellow Republican members of
Congress and the Ohio Republican Party said he should resign. When
he ignored that advice the chairmen of the Republican Party
organizations in his district said Lukens would be officially
shunned if he showed up at any GOP gathering.
   At the request of House Republicans, the House Ethics Committee
opened an investigation into whether Lukens violated any House
rules.
   The investigation of Frank was triggered by allegations by
Steven Gobie, a male prostitute whom Frank admitted paying $80 for
sex in 1985. Frank also has admitted hiring Gobie, with personal
funds, to work as his housekeeper and driver, but said he fired
Gobie when he learned his apartment was being used for the
sex-for-hire business.
   ``The (Ethics) Committee may choose from several options in
addressing these members, including not to do anything at all,''
Dannemeyer's letter said. ``After the committee has reported to the
House on the case of Mr. Frank, I will offer a resolution of
expulsion if the committee recommendation fails to do so. I will do
the same if Mr. Lukens' appeal fails.''
   In his letter, Dannemeyer didn't specify how he planned to force
an on-the-record vote, but listed a few options.
   ``The vote may come in the form of an appeal of the chair, a
motion to table or on the actual question. But the vote will
occur,'' he wrote. ``Those who will remember back only a year ago
will remember how a motion to adjourn was used as a vote on the pay
raise. Anything goes.''

<HEAD>Rostropovich Prepares to Visit Soviet Union After 16-Year Exile</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Welcome home!'' Soviet Ambassador Yuri
Dubinin shouted over a champagne toast, and conductor Mstislav
Rostropovich responded with bear hugs and kisses as he prepared to
return to his homeland after 16 years of exile in the West.
   The emotional exchange took place Thursday night at a bon voyage
party at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts
honoring Rostropovich and members of the National Symphony
Orchestra, who leave Monday on a three-week tour of Japan and the
Soviet Union.
   As guests sipped Russian vodka and nibbled on Beluga caviar,
Rostropovich said the dismantling of the Berlin Wall was a ``symbol
of a new era for our life,'' uniting his old family in the East
with his new family in the West.
   He said his ``greatest joy'' was to ``see one family on this
planet.''
   Rostropovich and his wife, soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, fled the
Soviet Union in 1974 because of government harassment and curbs on
their artistic freedom. Soviet authorities announced last week that
they had restored the citizenship stripped from Rostropovich and
his wife in 1978, the year after he was appointed music director of
the National Symphony.
   Rostropovich said Thursday night, ``I am so excited, I am so
emotional'' at the prospect of returning home with music that
bridges East and West with the language of friendship.
   ``Capitalism, communism _ it's all garbage,'' Rostropovich
declared.
   Dubinin, toasting the exiled conductor with champagne, said
Rostropovich's four-day concert tour of Moscow and Leningrad with
the orchestra in mid-February was ``a sign of new times'' and proof
that ``dreams come true.''
   The ambassador said the tour ``will be an exceptional
manifestation of (Soviet) Chairman (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev's policy
of perestroika, the new political thinking and new relations
between the Soviet Union and the United States.''
   ``Welcome to the Soviet Union,'' he shouted. Turning to
Rostropovich, he added: ``Welcome home!'' The two then embraced for
a long moment and turned to kiss their wives.
   Rostropovich said earlier this week that the restoration of his
citizenship would not persuade him to abandon his new life in the
West and return permanently to the Soviet Union.
   But one result of the Soviet government's action was to prompt
his wife, Galina, to drop her earlier objections and consent to
accompany her husband on the tour. The couple's daughter, Olga, who
lives in New York, also will make the trip.
   Orchestra officials disclosed Thursday night that Rostropovich
will take about 600,000 disposable medical syringes with him as a
gift to the Soviet people, who reportedly are threatened by an AIDS
epidemic in Siberia.
   The officials said the conductor is paying for the syringes,
which are in short supply in the Soviet Union, out of his personal
concert fees. The purchase was arranged by industrialist Armand
Hammer, who donated $100,000 to underwrite the costs of the
orchestra's tour.
   Hammer, 91, said he will be in the audience when Rostropovich
conducts the orchestra's first concert on Feb. 13 in the Bolshoi
Hall of the Moscow Conservatory. On the program for that concert
will be Tchaikovsky's 6th (``Pathetique'') Symphony, the last piece
that Rostropovich conducted _ and on the same stage _ before he
sought exile in the West.

   The stork may visit one of the seven courting
California condor couples at the Los Angeles Zoo.
   Cachuma and Cuyama have produced a 5-inch by 3-inch egg that
scientists hope holds the birds' second offspring in captivity.
   Scientists should know in seven to 10 days whether the egg is
fertilized. If it is, the chick would hatch in 55 to 66 days.
   Fewer than three dozen California condors are known to exist.
All are in captivity.
   After discovering the egg Thursday, zoo officials placed it in
an incubator. The egg will be kept at a constant 97.5 degrees and
turned every two hours.
   Pulling the egg from the nest may encourage the condors to
produce another egg, officials said. When condors existed in the
wild, they usually reared one chick every two years.
   Four California condor chicks have been hatched at the zoo,
including Kaduka, the firstborn to Cachuma and Cuyama.

   Chinese students said they feared being shipped
back to their homeland after the Senate upheld President Bush's
veto of a bill protecting them from deportation when their visas
expire.
   ``Many students fear they will be sent back. I'm scared for all
my friends,'' said Yuan Liu, 30, a Chinese student enrolled at
Brandeis University.
   ``I think it's a sad day for us,'' said Pei Min Xin, 33, a
doctoral student at Harvard University who led the pro-democracy
protests in Beijing last spring. ``I'm afraid that the president
will continue his policy of accommodating the Chinese dictators.''
   Bush said the bill to eliminate that requirement was unnecessary
because he has signed an administrative order allowing Chinese
students to stay in the United States.
   The president said the legislation could have damaged U.S.
relations with China, which has condemned the action and threatened
to curtail exchange programs if it becomes law.
   The Senate voted 62-37 Thursday to override the presidential
veto, four votes short of the two-thirds necessary. The House voted
overwhelmingly Wednesday to reject Bush's veto.
   Xiaxia Gong, 33, a Harvard graduate student, was among several
Chinese students gathered at the China Information Center in Newton
who said the failed legislation would have given them a sense of
security.
   Many of the students fled to the United States after the Chinese
government cracked down on the protests in Tiananmen Square. Under
the visa's requirements, bearers must return to China when their
visas expire and live there for two years before they can apply for
a new one.
   The students fear that the president's order could be reversed
someday, leaving them vulnerable to deportation to their homeland
where they might be jailed.
   ``I don't believe Mr. Bush,'' Gong said. ``How can we believe
someone who has already cheated and sent high-level officials to
China when he said he would not? We don't want our destiny put in
someone else's hands.''
   In Salem, Ore., Chinese students at Oregon State University said
they couldn't understand the Senate vote.
   ``It did send a message to China, but it did not stand for human
rights,'' Wang De Qian, co-vice president of the university's
Chinese student association.
   Shu Ouang said the student association ``did not want to
override the president, but the veto. We want to send a stronger
message to the Chinese butchers.''

   The dollar closed lower against the Japanese yen
Friday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined
moderately.
   The dollar finished the week at 143.97 yen, down 1.33 yen from
Thursday's close of 145.30 yen. It opened at 143.65 yen and ranged
between 143.50-144.25 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which posted a
190.13-point gain Thursday, shed 95.04 points, or 0.25 percent,
closing the week at 36,874.07.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's weakness reflected its sharp
decline overnight in New York.
   A report that U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
had expressed ``cautious interest'' in reinstating a withholding
tax on foreign investors in the United States helped knock the
dollar lower in New York. Such a move would slow foreign
investment, which has been an important stimulus for recent U.S.
economic growth, analysts say.
   The report notwithstanding, Greenspan in fact cautioned a
Congressional committee Thursday against placing any new
impediments on foreign investment.
   ``The impact of the Fed chairman's reported remark lingered in
the market,'' said Masaaki Shikada, a dealer with Fuji Bank.
   Shikada also attributed the dollar's decline against the yen to
local news reports that Japan's long-term prime rate is likely to
be raised by 0.7 percentage point to 7.5 percent on Feb. 1.
   A banking source, who spoke anonymously, said some Japanese
long-term banks, including the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, will
announce their rate hike later in the day.
   The prime rate is a preferential rate of interest charged by
commercial banks on loans to their most credit-worthy customers.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei index started higher in a
favorable reaction to the yen's strength against the dollar and
higher bond prices, but later turned weak, securities dealers said.
   ``After a round of buying orders, the index lost steam'' as many
market participants retreated to the sidelines due to uncertainty
about the outcome of a major national election here slated for Feb.
18, said a Nomura Securities' analyst who spoke anonymously.

   ``I happened to
see a plane going very low,'' said another witness, David Johnson.
``At the altitude it was at I really could not hear any engines. So
I am assuming the engines had conked out but there really was no
fire or anything.''
   The crash occurred on a narrow peninsula jutting into Oyster
Bay, just south of the Sagamore Hill National Historic Site, home
of President Theodore Roosevelt. It is an isolated, wooded area of
expensive homes.
   Nick Fisher, a cameraman for WCBS-TV, said there were ``maybe
hundreds'' of rescue workers and volunteers caring for the injured.
   ``The plane is laying on an incline in a wooded area adjacent to
a house,'' Fisher said.
   The New York City Emergency Medical Service, asked for help by
Nassau County police, sent five ambulances and a Mobile Emergency
Room Vehicle to the crash scene, an EMS spokesman said.
   According to Radio Colombiana, Flight 52 left Bogota with a
stopover in Medellin, the city known for its notorious cocaine
cartel, en route to New York.
   The control tower at Bogota's El Dorado International Airport
said the Avianca airliner left Bogota at 1:30 p.m. EST, arrived at
Medellin 2:02 p.m., then left Medellin at 5:30 p.m. and was
scheduled to land in New York at 10 p.m. EST.
   A spokeswoman for Avianca at El Dorado said the company would
have no immediate information or statement. Alan Morrison, a
spokesman for the Port Authority, said the airline had informed
officials that there was no passenger list for the flight.
   At Kennedy, officials were attempting to compile a list by
interviewing families and friends of the passengers. They were
taken to first-class lounge room at the Pan American Airways
terminal, where the Avianca hangar is located.
   One anxious relative, John Bedoia, 30, of Queens, said he had
gone to the airport to meet his brother, Guillermo Bedoia, 28, and
sister-in-law, Magnolia, 26.
   ``A worker told me the plane was not landing because of the
weather,'' he said. ``When I went home I saw the news. I came back
to see what's happening but they won't tell me anything.''
   ``People are worried and crying and calling their relatives,''
said Leonora Valencia, 28, of Queens, who had gone with her son to
meet her cousin, Maria Maraugenin, 41.
   Boeing officials in Seattle said the Avianca plane was 23 years
old, having been first delivered to Pan Am in January 1967 and
transferred to Avianca in February 1977. Avianca owns two 707s,
they said.
   According to Jane's All The World's Aircraft, Boeing produced
the 707 model jetliner for commercial use from 1955 until 1982.
   Last Nov. 27, an Avianca Boeing 727 was bombed out of the sky
minutes after takeoff from Bogota on a domestic flight to Cali. The
explosion killed all 107 people on board.
   The Extraditables group, made up of drug traffickers fearing
extradition to the United States, claimed responsibility for the
bombing in a phone call to the Colombian radio network Caracol.
   Matt Murphy, the duty agent at the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration office in New York, said the DEA did not know of any
threats to the plane and had not received any general threats
against Colombian airliners recently.
   ``I don't see it as being any drug cartels involved at this
time,'' he said. ``If we find out later you never know, but at this
time there's no indication of that.''
   Murphy also noted that the plane was close to its destination
when it crashed, which he said was an indication that sabotage was
not involved.
   In Washington, a spokesman for the National Transportation
Safety Board, Ted Lopatkiewicz, said the agency would ``be sending
a full team'' to investigate.

   Although actress Kim Basinger now owns a
big chunk of the town of Braselton, she still needs government
approval before building a planned movie and recording studio
complex.
   The star of ``Batman'' closed a $20 million deal Wednesday to
buy about one-third of this northeast Georgia town of 500 from the
Braselton family, descendants of the town's founders.
   But like any other developer, Miss Basinger will have to present
her plans to the mayor and city council.
   ``She'll be considered just like any resident,'' saidHenry
Edward Braselton, the town's mayor. ``We'll get the county building
inspector to look at (her plans). He'll make recommendations to the
council, and we'll either accept it or reject it.
   ``Anything good, we're not going to turn down,'' he said. ``I
expect she could convince you of most anything. She's a beautiful
girl. I think I'd have to vote for her if she ran against me.''

   Anxious friends and relatives fretted
over scant news at Kennedy International Airport while rescue
workers struggled on Long Island's heavily wooded north shore to
find survivors of Avianca Flight 52.
   Local television showed pictures of dazed survivors being pulled
from the wreckage, some bloodied. Some people appeared to be
trapped in the twisted metal and some lay motionless. Others,
including several children, were carried away crying by rescuers.
   Amanda Pinzon, 27, of Elizabeth, N.J., who was waiting at
Kennedy with relatives who had come to meet the plane, cried with
joy when she saw her husband, Jesus, and 2-year-old son, Brian, on
television, among the survivors being taken to hospitals.
   ``I feel great, I'm so happy _ happy, crying, everything,'' she
said.
   Her 13-year-old niece, Jo Ellen Pena, said her uncle and cousin
were bandaged and bloody but seemed to be OK.
   Dr. Bruce Rebold, who lives in the affluent, sparsely populated
area near the crash site, said he was reading the newspaper and a
movie script when a picture fell off the wall and some pottery fell
down.
   He didn't hear anything but he felt the impact of what he later
found out was the crash. He looked out his window and did not see
anything and ran out to the site.
   Rebold said he saw a portion of the fuselage with the red
lettering ``Avianca.''
   ``It looked like it hit a hill and cracked in half. I saw people
trying to scramble out of the plane. I didn't see any bodies,'' he
said. ``It was shocking. It was like being on a movie set.''
   At Kennedy Airport, about 200 anxious relatives and friends
waited in the first class lounge of Pan American World Airways, but
complained that they received very little information from the
remote site. Late reports had possibly as many as 50 dead and
scores more injured.
   Mark Marchese, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said, ``They
know it's a crash but it's a very eerie calm, very little
hysteria.''
   He said priests and rabbis were offering emotional support to
those waiting. Others, however, sought comfort in finding out as
much information as they could.
   Several of the relatives wandered over to a bank of pay-for-view
miniature television sets in the airport and watched for the latest
information.
   Among those waiting for word of survivors was Jairo Perez, who
said he saw his sister, Elena, on television. He said Elena had
gone to Colombia to adopt a girl. He said the child also survived.
   In tears, he said in Spanish: ``They're alive.''
   The Boeing 707 crashed at about 9:45 p.m. near Oyster Bay Harbor
in an affluent area just south of the Sagamore Hill National
Historic Site, home of President Theodore Roosevelt. It is a
isolated, wooded area of expensive homes on two-acre lots whose
residents include the parents of tennis pro John McEnroe.
   Rescue efforts were hindered by the narrow road that leads to
the crash site. The road was clogged with rescue vehicle and many
of the rescue crews had to park far away from the crash site and
carry equipment to the injured passengers.

<HEAD>SEC Suspends Stock Trading of Generic Drug Maker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has
suspended for 10 days trading in the securities of Bolar
Pharmaceutical Co., the generic drug maker accused of falsifying
safety claims.
   The SEC said it temporarily suspended Bolar trading Thursday due
to ``the lack of adequate current information concerning the recent
public disclosure that certain false documents were submitted to
the Food and Drug Administration.''
   On Tuesday, a House subcommittee disclosed a letter from Bolar's
attorneys that indicated the Copaigue, N.Y.-based generic drug
maker apparently falsified documents about safety tests for its
version of the popular blood pressure-controlling drug Dyazide,
made by SmithKline Beecham.
   The SEC said suspension began at 9:30 a.m. Thursday and would
continue until 11:59 p.m. on Feb. 3.
   ``The SEC made their decision to suspend trading because the
company did not disclose enough information, and when we can, we
will,'' said Bolar spokeswoman Patricia Shukri, refusing to comment
further.
   Bolar's anti-hypertension drug is the only generic version of
Dyazide on the market. Another company pulled its version after it
admitted cheating on tests required for FDA approval.

<HEAD>FDA Warns About Dangers of L-tryptophan Supplement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is cautioning
consumers against buying potentially dangerous L-tryptophan dietary
supplements distributed nationally by a California company.
   The company _ NutriCology Inc. of San Leandro, Calif., which
also markets under the name of Allergy Research Group _ has not
complied with an urgent FDA recall request, the agency said
Thursday.
   A woman answering the company's telephone refused to relay
repeated calls to a company official or supervisor.
   The FDA said 334 other manufacturers, repackers and distributors
have complied with the Nov. 17 request for recall of products that
would result in a total dietary intake of 100 milligrams or more of
L-tryptophan a day.
   The FDA requested the recall because L-tryptophan, an amino
acid, has been linked to eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, which is
marked by severe muscle and joint pain, swelling of the arms and
legs, skin rash and sometimes fever.
   The Centers for Disease Control has reports of 1,143 cases of
the syndrome, including nine deaths _ one of which has been
confirmed to have been ``clearly associated'' with L-tryptophan.
   Public health experts have not been able to identify a specific
lot, brand, manufacturer or supplier of the supplement as the cause
of the outbreak. They also have been unable to pinpoint a specific
chemical or microbial contaminant that could be responsible, the
FDA said.

<HEAD>Researchers Find Compound Effective Against AIDS In Test Tube</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers say a synthetic compound has been
shown in laboratory experiments to prevent reproduction of the AIDS
virus in a way different than AZT, the only anti-viral drug now
approved for use against AIDS.
   The compound, a manmade peptide called U-81749, appears to block
the final stage of a process the AIDS virus uses to reproduce
itself in human cells. AZT, or zidovudine, attacks an earlier stage
in the life cycle of the virus.
   ``It (U-81749) drastically slows down and reduces the number of
mature viral particles you get in an infection,'' Leonard Post,
director of infectious disease research at the Upjohn Co., where
the compound was developed, said Thursday.
   The compound works by inhibiting the action of protease, an
enzyme used by the AIDS virus to process proteins during the final
stages of its reproduction, Post said. The result is that the virus
cannot make mature copies of itself, and this prevents the spread
of infection to other cells, he said.
   Post emphasized that the compound has been used only in test
tubes on cultured cells and that it will be years before such a
compound will be ready for human tests.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is caused by the
human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. When this virus invades a
human cell, it takes over the cell's protein-making machinery to
reproduce itself.
   During this process, the virus directs the creation of a number
of different proteins. Protease is an enzyme the virus uses to chop
up a large protein molecule, called p55, into several different
types of smaller protein molecules needed to make a mature HIV
particle.
   Post said that by blocking the action of protease, the p55
molecule is not processed and the viral particle does not mature.

<HEAD>Texas Congressmen Question Bush's Commitment to Supercollider</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas congressmen are questioning President
Bush's commitment to the super collider now that he has requested
$318 million instead of the expected $393 million for second-year
construction funds.
   Bush's budget, to be unveiled Monday, will ask for $75 million
less than what had been anticipated for the giant particle
accelerator being built in Ellis County, Texas, Sen. Phil Gramm
said Thursday.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said he had hoped for a higher
starting point, ``since I have no doubt, with our budget deficit
situation, that Congress will whittle away at it.
   ``Only a few days ago, a White House spokesman was warning that
Congress might make cuts in the president's budget for the SSC
(supercollider). What he didn't warn us was that we'd see
substantial cuts before Congress even gets its turn,'' Bentsen said.
   Bush last year requested $250 million for the SSC; Congress
allocated $225 million.
   Rep. Jim Chapman, D-Texas, said the new request ``certainly
shows less than the full commitment of the administration to the
project.''
   Gramm, R-Texas, said he was assured by Deputy Energy Secretary
W. Henson Moore that the $318 million represents as much as the DOE
believes it could actually spend in 1991 on the collider.
   The collider would be in far greater danger in Congress from the
``sticker shock'' of a higher price tag should the Energy
Department recommend the cost exceed $5.9 billion, Gramm said.
   He said Moore told him the lower figure would not have any
impact on the project, which if completed would be the largest,
most complicated scientific instrument ever built. Scientists hope
to use it to test theories about the building blocks of the
universe.

   A Colombian Boeing 707 with more than 140
people aboard crashed in fog and rain Thursday night while on
approach to Kennedy International Airport, killing about 50 people
and injuring scores more, authorities said.
   Avianca Flight 52, en route from Bogota, crashed at about 9:45
p.m. in this isolated, exclusive hamlet on the north shore of Long
Island, Kennedy airport officials said.
   The jetliner had reported losing power in one or two engines and
was on its second approach to Kennedy when it crashed, breaking
into several pieces, officials said. Witnesses said there was no
fire or explosion.
   ``There were just dead bodies all over the place. ... It was the
worst thing you ever saw,'' an unidentified young man who arrived
at the scene told WNBC-TV.
   ``Kids were screaming for their parents. Parents were screaming
for their kids,'' said Robert LaBella, a Long Island resident wh
helped remove six people from the wreckage. After that, ``I just
couldn't take it anymore.''
   Early Friday morning, Dr. George Dunn of Glen Cove Community
Hospital, who was on the scene, said rescuers had counted 40 to 50
dead. But Chuck DeGaetano of the New York City Emergency Medical
Service said those killed numbered in the ``high 50s.''
   By early Friday, 92 people had been transported from the scene
to hospitals, said Sgt. James Callahan of Nassau County Police
Emergency Medical Bureau.
   WCBS radio said that of those 92, one died en route and one died
at a hospital. Callahan said there were no other living survivors
at the scene.
   ``There's a lot of confusion going on,'' EMS spokeswoman Lynn
Schulman said. ``Our medical director is at the scene. ... It's
very dark. It's a wooded area.''
   Dunn, asked about the number of survivors, said, ``It's amazing.
And many of the injuries were not all that major.'' One of the
reasons for the high survival rate was that the aircraft didn't
burn, he said.
   Some of the injured were in critical condition with multiple
fractures and shock, hospital officials said. Of the injured, at
least nine were children.
   Many ambulances and helicopters were at the scene, where
bloodied victims were lined up on stretchers. Some passengers were
seen lying motionless. Others, including children, were dazed but
conscious and apparently not seriously hurt as they were helped
from the wreckage.
   ``There were some people trying to get out through the
windows,'' said a nearby resident, Dr. Bruce Rebold.
   Eyewitnesses said that many of those who survived the crash
spoke only Spanish.
   Kennedy's control tower lost contact with Flight 52 at 9:34 p.m.
when the 23-year-old Boeing 707 was about 15 miles northeast of the
airport after a five-hour flight, said Port Authority Police
Officer Phil Montouri.
   Montouri said ``there was no radio communication at all to the
tower. It just went down.''
   The plane had missed one approach to Kennedy and gone around a
second time, according to Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the
Federal Aviation Administration. CNN reported that the plane ran
out of fuel before it crashed.
   Control tower officials said the plane may have lost power in
one of its four engines. Bergen said the agency had reports the
plane lost a second engine as well.
   A ham operator monitoring an aircraft scanner at his home in the
Bronx reported hearing a brief radio message from a crew member
calling for help just before Flight 52 disappeared from radar
screens, The New York Times reported.
   ``Avianca 052. We have just lost two engines. Dumping fuel.
Requesting emergency assistance,'' the message said, according to
ham operator Anthony Rosati.
   The jet broke into four pieces upon impact, said Coast Guard
Petty Officer Jeff Crawley. There was less than half a mile of
visibility and it was raining at the time of the crash, according
to the National Weather Service.
   Steve Ulman, a Cove Neck resident, said the plane narrowly
missed a house and crashed three houses away from one owned by
tennis star John McEnroe.
   The airliner went down in the town of Cove Neck, located at
about the same place where the tower lost contact, said Officer
Peter Franzone of the Nassau County police. The plane carried 142
passengers and a crew of seven, authorities said.
   Caracol Radio in Colombia, however, reported there were 151
people aboard, but did not differentiate between passengers and
crew.
   Crawley said several cutters and boats were en route to the area
just in ase some debris or victims were in Oyster Bay Harbor, next
to the crash site.
   Peter Whitelaw, who lives down a hill from the crash site, said
he could see a small portion of the downed plane through the trees.
He said there were few homes in the area.
   ``I heard a rumbling, a very loud rumbling,'' said Whitelaw, who
was on an indoor tennis court at the time. ``It sounded as if your
car was gearing back and you were stripping the gears, and the
typical rumble you get from a jet plane going over.''
   ``Normally in bad weather they circle out here but this was
louder than normal. Then we heard the crash,'' he said, adding that
through the woods ``I see no flames or smoke, or smell anything.''
   He said the road leading to the crash site was clogged with
emergency vehicles.
   ``These are very narrow roads,'' Whitelaw said. ``They're trying
the best they can to get to where it crashed. They're running up
the road with stretchers and medical equipment.'' Most phone lines
were down and power was cut off, he said.

   Four U.S. Navy ships rescued 14
Chinese seamen and recovered four bodies from a merchant ship that
sank off Luzon island, a U.S. Navy spokesman said today.
   A fifth body was caught in the wreck, and the last of the 20
crewmembers was missing, the spokesman said.
   Lt. Joseph Gradisher, spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet,
said the Chinese vessel Huazhu sank before noon Thursday about 40
miles off the north coast of Luzon.
   He said the survivors and the dead were picked up after more
than three hours of searching aided by U.S. Navy helicopters.
   Gradisher said the USS Lake Champlain, the USS Stein, the USS
Lockwood and the USNS Navasota were sailing in the area when they
heard a distress call from the Chinese ship. He said the ship was
en route from Malaysia to Japan when it began taking on water.
   The survivors and the dead were brought to the U.S.-run Subic
Bay naval base, 50 miles west of Manila, by the USS Champlain early
today, Gradisher said. He said two survivors were in serious
condition, while the rest were treated for slight injuries.
   The survivors will be turned over to representatives of the
Chinese Embassy in Manila, he said.

<HEAD>Retired Agent Alleges FBI Coverup In Miller Spy Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key witness against Richard Miller, the
only FBI agent convicted of spying, alleged that the agency may
have covered up information that would have helped Miller's
defense, court papers show.
   Retired FBI Agent John Hunt also said in documents filed
Thursday that the agency knew Miller wasn't the only FBI agent
sexually involved with Soviet informant Svetlana Ogorodnikov.
   Miller, a 20-year FBI veteran, was convicted of passing
classified documents to Mrs. Ogorodnikov, with whom he was having
an affair.
   His conviction was overturned by a federal appeals court last
year based on the admission of lie-detector evidence at his trial.
He is free on bail awaiting his third trial, expected to begin come
spring.
   Hunt's allegations, in a letter to FBI Director William Sessions
last summer, were among volumes of documents filed by Miller's
lawyers Thursday as part of a motion to dismiss the charges against
Miller.
   Hunt was a key witness in the 1985 and 1986 trials. Miller's
first jury deadlocked; the second convicted him.
   In his 10-page letter, Hunt alleged the bureau covered up ``in
order to divert public and congressional attention away from the
FBI's own administrative mishandling of Miller prior to his
arrest.''
   At his trials, Miller was portrayed as an overweight, inept FBI
misfit who turned to spying out of vengeance. But he maintained he
was trying to redeem a lackluster career by recruiting Mrs.
Ogorodnikov as a double agent and infiltrating the Soviet spy
network.
   The letter was recently obtained by the defense lawyers who
subpoenaed it over government opposition.
   The Hunt letter requested a meeting between Hunt and Sessions,
but a response showed that Sessions refused because of ``pending
litigation.''
   In a letter to Sessions, Hunt's lawyer, Lynn Lincoln Sarko, said:
   ``Mr. Hunt believes that the FBI may have engaged in a cover-up
of this affair by concealing certain information and by failing to
follow up leads in the espionage case ... and by knowingly
falsifying the results of its own investigations.''
   Sarko's letter and other documents suggested that another FBI
agent assigned to the Foreign Counterintelligence Squad with Miller
had a sexual affair with Mrs. Ogorodnikov. The agent's name was
blacked out of classified documents attached to the motion.
   Hunt has denied defense claims that he had an affair with Mrs.
Ogorodnikov.
   Hunt's lawyer raised the question of whether FBI mishandling of
the case ``may have deprived Miller and Ogorodnikov of their most
logical and powerful defense to the charges against them.''
   Defense attorneys Stanley Greenberg and Joel Levine alleged that
Miller was the victim of prosecutorial misconduct in a cover-up of
evidence helpful to the former agent's defense.
   ``Defendant Miller has always insisted that his objective in the
relationship with Svetlana was to benefit the FBI,'' said the
defense motion. ``The fact that other agents on the very same squad
may have had (a) similar relationship with her and (similar)
objectives certainly bears on the reasonableness of conduct.''
   Messages were left Thursday for Assistant U.S. Attorney Russell
Hayman and Sessions, but they did not return calls.
   A hearing on the motion was set for March 26.

<HEAD>`In the Blood': A Movie in Defense of Hunting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARK CITY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is it a contradiction to love animals and
still shoot them dead?
   A new movie says no, and depicts hunters as naturalists.
   Likely to become one of the year's more divisive films, ``In the
Blood'' is a feature-length documentary arguing that big-game
hunting plays an integral role in conservation.
   Written and directed by George Butler, a hunter from age 6, ``In
the Blood'' takes the position that ``one does not hunt in order to
kill.''
   It shows hunting as a bonding rite and a fundamental privilege.
   The movie, opening Feb. 16 in Houston, was shown Thursday in the
documentary competition of the Sundance United States Film Festival.
   ``I had a tremendously difficult time making this movie,''
Butler said. ``The prejudice against hunting is so powerful in the
film industry.''
   Butler released his ``Pumping Iron'' bodybuilding films
independently because Hollywood frowned upon that topic, too.
   ``I make films about unfashionable subjects,'' Butler said.
   Five years in the making, ``In the Blood'' was backed by 20
investors, including the hunting-wetland preservation group Ducks
Unlimited.
   In a creative fund-raising move, President Theodore Roosevelt's
Holland &amp; Holland rifle was purchased and resold by the production
company to help make ends meet.
   Among the more noteworthy organizations not sponsoring the film:
the National Rifle Association. ``I'm sure that I could have gotten
all the money I needed from the NRA,'' Butler said. ``But I have no
association with them. ... They're a gun lobby, not a hunting
lobby.''
   Indeed, Butler said he has tried not to arouse undue
controversy. He prefers to let the film speak for itself.
   Wherever the movie has been shown, a few people have walked out,
Butler said.
   Although the film does not glorify hunting _ it shows a young
hunter's errant shot causing a buffalo to die a slow death _ it
does state: ``No animal in Africa dies of old age.'' If a bullet
doesn't kill an older lion, something else will.
   The film's premise is that hunting, when well-conceived and
well-executed, improves the cycle of life.
   In remarks after the film's showing, Robin Hurt, a veteran
hunting guide who appears in the movie, said: ``We have interfered
so much in the balance of nature (in the past) that we need to keep
interfering to balance the scales.''

<TEXT>
   The Australian government today opened
its first prosecution of a suspected Nazi war criminal, accusing a
73-year-old pensioner of complicity in the deaths of at least 850
Jews in World War II.
   Ivan Timofeyevich Polyukhovich was charged in Adelaide's
Magistrate's Court with murder in connection with 24 deaths and
complicity in hundreds of other deaths between 1939 and 1945.
   Polyukhovich, standing quietly, entered no plea. He was released
on $160,000 bail and ordered to report to police three times a week
pending a March 2 appearance to set a trial date.
   Prosecutors refused to divulge any information about the case,
including details of the charges, the man's former nationality, the
year he arrived in Australia or other history.
   ``He's entitled to a fair trial,'' said the prosecutors'
spokeswoman, Leone Kennedy.
   The Adelaide Advertiser newspaper said Polyukhovich settled in
Australia at age 41 and worked as a forest warden.
   It said that in 1986 several hundred people in the Rovno
district of the Ukraine had demanded his extradition. It cited a
Soviet news agency report.
   Two years ago, Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke ordered the
establishment of a Special Investigations Unit to investigate
whether any former Nazis were living in Australia.
   His action followed a report by the government-funded Australian
Broadcasting Corp. that hundreds of Nazis had taken refuge in
Australia.
   Bob Greenwood, head of the team prosecuting Polyukhovich, had
said about 450 people were under investigation and some were
suspected of atrocities.
   Although the charges were not read in public today, court
documents allege that Polyukhovich killed five men, 12 women, three
girls and four boys, including a 1-year-old.
   The documents obtained by The Associated Press also allege that
Polyukhovich was ``knowingly concerned'' with the deaths of 850
Jews from the Serniki ghetto in Rovno District, Ukraine, between
August 1941 and May 1943.
   The documents did not elaborate.
   A total of nine charges were brought under Section Nine of the
War Crimes Act of 1945. The names of some of the victims were given
in court documents, but the identities of many of them were unknown.
   Magistrate Grantley Harris suppressed the home address of
Polyukhovich, who also had reportedly used the names Ivan
Ivanechko, Jan Jan Poluchowicz and John Poluchowicz. He was ordered
to surrender any passports, to stay in the country and make no
contact with prosecution witnesses.

   Ethiopian rebels claimed today they killed
more than 3,900 government soldiers, wounded more than 5,200 and
downed three aircraft in renewed fighting in a northwestern
province.
   The rebels' clandestine radio, ``Voice of the Tigre
Revolution,'' said the three-day battle in Gondor Province ended
Wednesday near Debre Tabor, a major garrison that the rebels
claimed to capture in mid-December.
   It was not clear whether government forces were trying to
reclaim the garrison, but the rebel radio said the army had sent in
four divisions and numerous aircraft.
   The government has said nothing about new fighting in Gondor,
and the rebel claim could not be independently confirmed. Reporters
have been barred from the region.
   The clandestine station is the voice of the Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front, a combined force of the Tigre
People's Liberation Front and the Ethiopia People's Liberation
Movement, a much smaller group.
   The rebels said they killed 3,912 soldiers, wounded 5,210 and
captured 270, ans also downed two Soviet-built MiG fighter planes
and a helicopter. They gave no details.
   Earlier this week, the rebels claimed to have killed or wounded
more than 8,000 government soldiers so far this month in Wollo
Province, south of Gondor.
   That claim also could not be confirmed.
   The Tigrean rebels have been fighting since 1974 to overthrow
the Marxist government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam. They say
they want a government patterned after that of Albania, the last
hard-line Communist state in Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>Appeal Will Last at Least a Year; Officer's Career Over</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police officer facing a 7-year sentence for
manslaughter in the deaths of two black men will be spared any
prison time for at least a year while his appeal and a novel legal
issue are considered, attorneys say.
   But the police career of William Lozano, 30, is over because of
the felony conviction, his attorney said. His fatal shooting of a
speeding motorcyclist and the passenger's death triggered three
nights of rioting a year ago.
   Lozano, who was on the police force four years, faces firing,
most likely at a departmental disciplinary review board hearing in
May, department spokesman Raymond Lang said Thursday. Lozano also
stands to lose his state certification as a police officer.
   ``His job as a police officer is finished,'' defense attorney
Roy Black said. ``He's going out to look for a job.''
   Black said Lozano would not comment.
   On Wednesday, the jury that convicted Lozano sentenced him to
seven years in prison, but let him remain free on bond while his
lawyers appeal.
   Black expects the case to continue for at least a year _ the
usual time frame for a case before the 3rd District Court of
Appeals in Miami.
   Richard Shiffrin, a Dade County prosecutor who will supervise
the state's appeal, suspects it could go much longer.
   ``If we prevail, I'm sure the defense will take it further. If
we lost on an issue that was reviewable by the Florida Supreme
Court or the U.S. Supreme Court, we would certainly pursue our
avenues also. I would expect this case to be around for a while,''
he said.
   ``There are a number of issues that are litigable. All he has to
do is win one'' to overturn the conviction or strike down the
sentence, Shiffrin said. ``We have to win them all.''
   The least-explored legal question is the decision by Dade
Circuit Judge Joseph Farina to seat a black juror after the defense
tried to oust him with a peremptory challenge _ normally an
uncontestable way of removing unwanted jurors.
   Postal union executive Ezra Simmons was seated on the judge's
order and went on to become the jury foreman.
   A few other states accept the forced seating of a juror when
race is the only factor for removal, but the current Florida
standard is to throw out the jury pool and start all over again,
Shiffrin noted.
   ``We'd be there all year if we were forced to strike the panel,
so the judge did the only possible thing,'' he said.
   The U.S. Supreme Court hasn't considered the issue of forced
seating.
   Among other issues raised by the defense are: the judge's
failure to move the trial out of Miami after the rioting; his
refusal to hear witnesses on the change-of-venue issue; the
introduction of police regulations as evidence on the use of deadly
force by an officer; and the exclusion of evidence about the
backgrounds of the two dead men.

   A twin-engine airplane with 19 people
on board disappeared in strong winds on a flight between Indonesian
islands, an official said today.
   The airport on Lombok island lost contact without warning with
the British-made Hawker Siddley-748 Thursday over Lombok Strait,
750 miles southeast of Jakarta, according to Salam Susanto of the
Communications Ministry.
   The turboprop plane is owned by P.T. Airfast, an Indonesian
company.
   The flight began in the city of Uujungpandang on south Sulawesi
island. It was headed for Lombok, about 500 miles to the southwest,
Susanto said.
   He said two helicopters had been sent to search for the missing
plane. He speculated the plane might have struggled with strong
winds in the area at the time it disappeared.

<HEAD>Eye Doctors Confront AIDS-Related Blindness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICH CARTIERE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eye doctors, traditionally immune from much
of the despair their colleagues in the medical profession face,
increasingly are being confronted with the cruel realities of AIDS
patients going blind before death.
   At a conference Thursday on vision impairment among AIDS
patients, ophthalmologists and medical and social workers were
cautioned they not only must steep themselves in the latest medical
treatments, but learn to deal with the distinct emotional crises of
people with the immune-destroying disease.
   ``You have the double challenge of not just making (medical)
theory alive, you are bringing hope alive,'' the Rev. William
Barcus told the group.
   Barcus, who has had AIDS for five years, slowly is losing his
sight.
   ``There are two things we live in deadly fear of: the first is
blindness ... the second great terror is dementia. While these may
be theory to you, to us they are terribly real, nerve-shattering,
heartbreaking,'' the Episcopal minister said.
   There are no precise figures on how many people with AIDS suffer
from some sort of vision-related problems, but various medical
studies range in estimates from 10 percent to 40 percent. As of
Nov. 30, there have been 115,158 cases of AIDS reported in the
United States.
   As well as despair, ophthalmologists also must deal with
self-pity, panic and even terror in AIDS patients.
   Psychologist Marsha Young, who works with visually impaired AIDS
patients in Oakland, described their loss or impairment of sight as
often mentally devastating. It sometimes leads to contemplation of
suicide.
   ``It is normal for a person to mourn the loss of sight, but ...
for a person with AIDS to start to mourn is sometimes a way of
giving up, and it's accompanied by all the feelings that go along
with that frustration, hopelessness, powerlessness,'' she said.
   Until the last few years of the AIDS epidemic few eye doctors
had to face the death of their patients, Dr. William Shekter, chief
of the Department of Ophthalmology at Kaiser Permanente Medical
Center in San Francisco, told the conference.
   Not since the end of World War II, when thousands of U.S.
soldiers returned home with vision-related injuries, has the
ophthalmology industry faced such a dramatic change in clientele,
he said.
   Besides finding previously unseen eye diseases in young adults
with AIDS, ophthalmologists are ``learning how tenaciously and
ferociously a healthy young person with AIDS will fight to retain
vision,'' Shekter said.
   Vision problems associated with AIDS, which destroys the body's
ability to fight even common infections, were first documented in
1985.
   More vision problems are being treated in AIDS patients because
earlier diagnosis and improved treatment has prolonged their lives,
according to officials of the conference, sponsored by the American
Foundation for the Blind and The Lighthouse for the Blind and
Visually Impaired. Vision problems appear to be associated with
later stages of AIDS.
   Professionals at the conference were cautioned that few agencies
now providing traditional services to the blind and visually
impaired are prepared to offer rehabilitative and counseling
assistance that may be needed for many of the estimated 1 million
to 1.5 million Americans already infected with the AIDS virus.

   A major snowstorm moved toward Canada today after socking the
mountains of the Northwest and the central Great Lakes states with
as much as 17 inches of snow, knocking out power lines and
crippling air and road traffic.
   ``It was real close to a blizzard,'' National Weather Service
meteorologist John Haase said. Accumulations would continue today,
he said.
   More snow and winds were forecast through the weekend as a cold
front churns from the Rockies to the Appalachians. Arctic air was
expected to follow the front southward into the upper Plains.
   The Southwest, however, looked today for above-normal
temperatures, mostly sunny skies and an end to the dense fog that
has lingered in the valleys all week.
   Westerly winds preceding the cold front were predicted to lash
the eastern Rockies _ at an average of more than 40 mph _ from
southeastern Montana to central Colorado. Gusts near 100 mph were
possible.
   Gale-force wind warnings were posted for much of the Great Lakes
and from the central New England coast to the Virginia coast.
   On Thursday, high winds ripped roofs off buildings in Michigan
and lightning injured 12 people in Illinois.
   Electricity was interrupted to at least 138,000 customers in
Wisconsin, Michigan and Illinois; airports in Milwaukee, St. Louis,
Detroit closed and Chicago airports canceled at least 50 percent of
their flights; and several highways were closed in Illinois, while
scores of minor accidents were reported throughout the region.
   In severe weather elsewhere, a tornado tore through a trailer
park in Centenary in south-central Alabama, injuring 28 people and
causing an estimated $2 million in damage.
   In the Washington Cascades, 17 inches of snow fell at Stevens
Pass on Thursday, half of it in 4 hours during the afternoon.
   Snowfall in Illinois ranged from 6 inches near Moline to 12
inches in Chicago's northern suburbs.
   Snowfall in northern Michigan included 8 inches at Sault Ste.
Marie, 10 inches at Pellston and about 11 inches at Traverse City.
   The northeastern mountains of Washington state and Oregon's
coastal range and Siskiyous were advised to expect more snow today.
   Winter storm warnings were posted over the Washington Cascades
and Olympics and for Wyoming's northwestern mountains.
   Snow advisories were in effect today for the Lake Tahoe-Truckee
area, northeastern California and parts of the Sierra Nevada.
   Winter storm watches remained over Wyoming's southwestern and
central mountains today and in Colorado's northern and central
mountains through Saturday.
   Winds gusting to 50 mph in downtown Indianapolis on Thursday
blew out windows from the 21st and 36th floors of the INB National
Bank Tower, injuring a 54-year-old woman who received a cut from
falling glass.
   The storm lashed southeast Iowa with 45 mph winds that whipped 5
inches of snow into a treacherous near-whiteout on roads slick with
ice.
   Winds gusted to about 70 mph at Beaver City, Pa., Laramie, Wyo.,
and Livingston, Mont. Gusts of 91 mph were recorded at Peru, Ind.
   Thursday was unseasonably warm for much of Florida. Record highs
were set in Jacksonville, with 83 degrees; West Palm Beach with 84
and Orlando's 85.
   High temperature for the Lower 48 states Thursday was 87 at
Melbourne, Fla.; the low was minus 10 at Gunnison, Colo.

   The dollar closed lower against the Japanese yen
today after an overnight fall in New York, while the key index on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost moderately.
   After opening at 143.65 yen, the dollar ranged between 143.50
yen and 144.25 yen before closing the week at 143.97 yen, down 1.33
yen from Thursday's close of 145.30 yen.
   ``The dollar was traded in a relatively narrow range,''
following its slide to 143.925 yen from 145.71 in New York
Thursday, said Akihiko Hori, a dealer with Mitsui Bank Ltd.
   He said he believed the sharp plunge of the dollar was a
temporary move in response to U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan's call Thursday for a withholding tax on foreign
investors in the United States.
   Such a move would slow foreign investment, which has been an
important stimulus for recent U.S. economic growth, analysts say.
   Other traders attriuted the dollar's decline to local reports
that Japan's long-term prime rate would be raised by 0.7 percentage
point to 7.5 percent, starting on Feb. 1.
   A banking source, who spoke anonymously, confirmed the reports
in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a major economic newspaper, and the
mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun. He said, however, that some
Japanese long-term banks will unofficially announce their rate
hikes earlier.
   The prime rate is a preferential rate of interest charged by
commercial banks on loans to their most credit-worthy customers.
   ``The planned raise in the prime rate was already factored into
foreign exchange trading,'' Hori said.
   But he said the measure will work as a ``stabilizing factor'' in
yen-dollar trading.
   Higher interest rates tend to push up a country's currency.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which rose 190.13 points Thursday, shed 95.04 points, or
0.25 percent, closing the week at 36,874.07.
   The index gained 20.49 points shortly after the market's opening.
   ``It played a tug of war the whole day and the Tokyo market
proved to be strong,'' said an analyst with Daiwa Securities Co.,
who spoke anonymously.
   He said fluctuations in the Nikkei index under 100 points would
be too small to judge the market's direction.
   The index started higher, encouraged by the yen's strength
against the dollar, even though the Dow Jones Industrial Average
plunged 43.46-points in New York overnight, he said. But the market
gradually lost steam as traders showed increasing concern over the
amount of Dow Jones slide.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five documentaries on subjects ranging from the
My Lai massacre to child prostitution won top broadcast journalism
awards for ``Frontline,'' the Public Broadcasting Service series.
   Jurors awarded the series a Gold Baton, the highest honors in
the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards, for outstanding
documentaries aired during the year ending in June.
   The five programs honored Thursday were: ``Remember My Lai,'' a
look back at the massacre of civilians in Vietnam in 1968; ``The
Spy Who Broke the Code,'' about the espionage activity of the
Walker family; ``Who Profits From Drugs,'' a look at drug-money
laundering by respectable people and institutions; ``Children of
the Night,'' about the death of a middle-class boy who became a
prostitute; and ``The Choice,'' campaign biographies of George Bush
and Michael Dukakis.
   Eleven other broadcasters were honored with Silver Batons, three
of which went to networks for coverage of the uprising in China and
events in Tiananmen Square. The winners were CBS News; Cable News
Network; and ABC News and Koppel Communications.
   Another prize for a network effort went to Gardner Productions
and WETA of Washington, D.C., for the PBS broadcast ``Arab and Jew:
Wounded Spirits in a Promised Land.''
   The awards were presented at Columbia on Thursday night, with
Robert MacNeil of PBS' ``The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' as host.
   In major markets, an award went to KCET of Los Angeles for two
programs, ``Expecting Miracles,'' about trying to overcome
infertility, and ``For the Sake of Appearances,'' an investigation
of cosmetic-surgery abuses.
   Another major market award was won by Byron Harris and WFAA-TV
of Dallas for ``Other People's Money,'' a report on
savings-and-loan failures.
   Other winners were:
   _Radio broadcasting, National Public Radio for ``AIDS and Black
America: Breaking the Silence,'' a series of 16 reports about the
reluctance of blacks to acknowledge an epidemic in their midst.
   _Independent television production, Appalshop of Whitesburg,
Ky., for ``On Our Own Land,'' an account of landowners fighting
mining companies.
   _Medium market television, Maryland Public Television for
``Other Faces of AIDS,'' about the disproportionate impact of the
disease on blacks and Hispanics.
   _Small-market television, WJXT of Jacksonville, Fla., for
``Crack Crisis: A Cry for Action,'' and WBRZ of Baton Rouge, La.,
for ``The Best Insurance Commissioner Money Can Buy.''
   The annual awards honoring excellence in broadcast journalism
were established in 1942 by Jessie Ball duPont as a memorial to her
husband. They have been administered by Columbia's Graduate School
of Journalism for the past 22 years.

   Security guards on a domestic Iran Air
flight foiled a hijacking and killed all four hijackers in a
shootout, the official news agency reported today.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, quoting a statement from the
Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps, said four ``armed terrorists''
tried to hijack the Boeing 727 on Thursday night on a flight
between the southern cities of Shiraz and Bandar Abbas.
   The corps, the internal security force, said all four hijackers
were killed in a shootout with agents who were on board the plane.
   An earlier report by the news agency said only that two
hijackers were wounded.
   The hijackers had taken a crew member hostage to force the pilot
to fly to an unspecified destination.
   The shootout occurred 90 miles outside Shiraz, said the report,
monitored in Nicosia.
   None of the passengers were wounded, and the plane returned to
Shiraz after the attempt, said the new agency, which was monitored
in Nicosia.

   More than a dozen political parties and
reform groups are debating how to share power with Communist
Premier Hans Modrow before free elections on May 6.
   Late Thursday, one of the four small parties aligned with the
dominant Communists announced it was resigning from Modrow's
27-member Cabinet, deepening the crisis of confidence facing the
interim premier.
   Opposition groups like the Neues Forum pro-democracy movement
and the newly formed Social Democrats have demanded a role in
Modrow's transitional government, but they are at odds with each
other over how much power and responsibility they should take on.
   As living standards have worsened along with the declining
economy, pressure for reunification with prosperous West Germany
has surged.
   The decision by Deputy Premier Lothar de Maiziere and two fellow
Christian Democrats to pull out of the Communist-led coalition was
presented as a move to make way for opposition groups to enter the
government. He said the other minority parties, who hold 11 seats
in the Cabinet, were likely to resign as well.
   But the pullout, effective Feb. 9, also distances the Christian
Democrats from the embattled Communist Party it served with over
the past 40 years.
   Communists now hold 16 ministerial posts, the Liberal Democrats
four, the Christian Democrats three, and the National Democrats and
farmers' party two each.
   Steffen Reiche, whose Social Democratic Party currently has no
representation in the government or parliament, called the
Christian Democrats' announced departure ``the crowning
irresponsibility of its 40-year service.''
   The Social Democrats and other opposition groups fear that if
the Christian Democrats succeed in cutting themselves off from the
Communists and, therefore, responsibility for the current state of
the nation, they would likely outpoll all other opposition groups
in the May elections.
   Modrow, a respected Communist who has attempted to stay above
the fray of the mounting political crisis, flew to Austria today
for a one-day official visit.
   The premier will travel to Moscow on Tuesday for talks with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, ADN said late Thursday.
   Modrow has been battling a groundswell of anti-Communist
sentiment in his nation of 16 million, as East Germans lose faith
that the economic crisis can be fixed and flee to the West at the
rate of about 2,000 a day.
   West Germany has promised financial aid and solidarity with East
Germany's drive for democracy in hopes of slowing the emigration
wave that threatens to send a million East Germans to the West this
year.
   Rudolf Seiters, chief of staff for West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, told reporters after his visit here Thursday that it was in
Bonn's interest to help stabilize the East German political and
economic situation.
   Seiters also announced that Modrow will visit Bonn on Feb. 13-14
to discuss the volatile situation in East Germany.
   He urged East Germany to create ``perspectives that entice them
to stay at home.''
   Modrow told reporters at the start of his meeting with Seiters
that the ``solidarity of West Germany in this difficult situation
is absolutely necessary.''
   Meanwhile, Economics Minister Christa Luft and East German
government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer met with reporters Thursday to
announce broad concessions to the demands of Western investors.
   Both Luft and Meyer referred repeatedly to the need to stabilize
the economy and political situation in East Germany, and
acknowledged the urgent need to institute reforms that could halt
the damaging exodus of East Germans.
   ``We should have spent a couple of weeks better planning what we
would do after we opened the borders,'' Ms. Luft conceded.
   She said the government has scrapped plans to limit foreign
ownership of joint ventures to 49 percent. East Germany also plans
to lift all restrictions on competition among private industry and
craftsmen, effectively opening the national economy to free
enterprise, according to Meyer.

<HEAD>Poll: Americans Unworried About Unified Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are generally unworried about the
prospect of a unified Germany, but the idea concerns some
Europeans, according to a joint poll by the Los Angeles Times and
The Economist.
   The survey conducted by the California newspaper and the British
magazine asked 2,677 adults in the United States, France, Great
Britain and Poland the same list of questions. Results were
published in the Times today.
   Of the 502 Poles surveyed, 69 percent said they would worry
about a reunified Germany becoming ``the dominant power in Europe.''
   Among 504 British and 511 French people surveyed, about 50
percent said they would be disturbed by a dominant Germany.
   In the United States, where 1,160 people were surveyed by
telephone Saturday, 29 percent said a dominant Germany would worry
them. Sixty-two percent said a reunified, dominant Germany would
not bother them.
   The Europeans were surveyed by the Economist during an
overlapping four-day period. The margin of sampling error for the
U.S. poll is plus or minus 4 percentage points. The margin in the
European poll is plus or minus 5 points.
   In the United States and France, 61 percent of those surveyed
said they favored a reunited Germany. In Great Britain, 45 percent
responded in favor of a reunited Germany and 41 percent of the
Poles said reunification would be best.
   Forty-four percent of Poles surveyed opposed any plan to reunify
the two German nations, while 30 percent of the British subjects
queried also opposed German reunification. In France, 15 percent
opposed reunification.
   Most Americans and Britons said they want to preserve U.S.
military levels in Europe. The French and Poles were split on the
issue.
   More than 300,000 U.S. troops are based in Europe.
   When asked whether democratic reform in Eastern Europe depended
on Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev retaining power, 50 percent of
British respondents said it did.
   Thirty-eight percent of U.S. citizens surveyed agreed, followed
by 32 percent in France and 23 percent in Poland.
   Seventy-two percent of the Poles surveyed said their fledgling
democratic reforms would gain strength even if Gorbachev loses
control of the Soviet Union.

   A grim sight greeted New York City
paramedic Jeff Race, the first rescuer on the scene of the Avianca
jetliner crash a half-mile from his family's home: ``Bodies on top
of bodies on top of bodies.''
   ``Some were alive, some were dead,'' Race, who was alerted to
the crash when the lights blinked off and on at his house, recalled
this morning. ``Limbs were bent every way you can imagine.''
   He went to work.
   First, Race sent his only predecessor at the scene _ a neighbor
with a flashlight _ to get all the blankets she could. He took the
flashlight and approached the crumpled Boeing 707 airplane in the
woods of his isolated suburban neighborhood.
   The plane, on its second approach to John F. Kennedy
International Airport about 15 miles away, crashed at about 9:45
p.m. Thursday, killing at least 67 of the 158 people aboard.
   ``People were screaming, some of them in different languages.
They were all screaming, `Help me. Help me. Help me,''' said Race,
whose father is a pilot for American Airlines. ``Most of them were
still strapped in their seats. It was just mangled, twisted metal.''
   Race, a lieutenant with the city's Emergency Medical Service and
volunteer firefighter in nearby Oyster Bay, said he pulled about
six children and a dozen adults from the wreckage, then set up a
triage area as other rescuers started to arrive.
   ``One things that sticks in my mind was a little boy who was
crying with a guy pinned underneath him in the wreckage,'' he said.
The man spoke, said Race: ``Get the kid out first.''
   The plane appeared to have skipped along tree tops before it
crashed into a hillside at the end of Tennis Court Road, where it
lay broken in pieces.
   ``I think it was a miracle for anybody on that plane to have
lived,'' said Race. ``It's a gift from God.''

<HEAD>Pope Urges Islanders to Remain Faithful Through Economic Hardship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINDELO, Cape Verde (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today urged Cape
Verde's Catholics to guard their Christian faith as the island
nation struggles to overcome poverty.
   Speaking to 35,000 chanting islanders in Mindelo, the former
Portuguese colony's cultural and economic capital on Sao Vicente
island, John Paul praised the islanders for their faith in the face
of ``adverse conditions.''
   Cape Verde's 10 islands are part of West Africa's impoverished
Sahel region, which for years had been plagued by drought, famine
and encroaching deserts.
   ``Without natural riches, your country is searching ... with
some success, for the paths to steady progress,'' the pope told the
town's packed sports stadium.
   He said shortages of rainfall and food as well as storms in the
archipelago off the West African coast were a ``trial of
suffering'' that had strengthened the islanders' faith.
   To the delight of the crowd, a light drizzle marked the pope's
arrival on Sao Vicente.
   ``Never hesitate to sacrifice everything to stay faithful to
Christ,'' the pope implored the crowd in Portuguese.
   The archipelago, colonized by the Portuguese in the 15th
century, has Africa's highest concentration of Roman Catholics,
over 90 percent of its 360,000 inhabitants.
   While stressing that the church supported progress that
guaranteed human integrity and harmony, the pope urged: ``Don't let
yourselves be chained by the myth of economic progress.''
   ``Fight against religious indifference _ the dangerous
temptation of modern times...to abandon religious practices when
you become too concerned with material interests, success, or
professional and social advancement,'' he said.
   The Polish-born pontiff received a clamorous welcome on Sal
island and in the capital, Cidade da Praia, on Thursday after he
urged rich countries not to abandon the needy Third World in favor
of Eastern European countries emerging from years of Communist rule.
   During John Paul's eight-day tour of the region, the sixth
African voyage of his pontificate, he will also visit
Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Burkina Faso and Chad.
   Though Cape Verde is one of the more prosperous nations in the
region, many islanders have left in search of better living
conditions.
   An estimated 400,000 Cape Verdians live and work abroad, mainly
in the United States, Portugal, France and the Netherlands.
   The pope also mentioned emigrants' problems in his Mindelo
address, advising them not to lose their cultural identity and
Christian faith.

<HEAD>Heavy Snow, High Winds Pummel Upper Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MOKRZYCKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The upper Midwest was digging out today from a fierce storm with
high winds that dumped up to 15 inches of snow, blacked out at
least 138,000 power customers, blew roofs off buildings and closed
three major airports.
   Four people died of heart attacks while shoveling snow from
Thursday's storm, authorities said. Three of them were in
Wisconsin, one in Illinois.
   Lightning injured 12 people in Illinois, and snow made driving
treacherous from Iowa to Ohio.
   ``This is the rural mailman's worst nightmare,'' said Tanis
Lehmann, postmaster in Cedar, Mich. ``I worry like a mother hen
until my carriers come back.''
   Up to 15 inches of snow fell in Michigan's Lower Peninsula.
   Heavy snow also fell in the Cascades and Olympic Mountains of
the Pacific Northwest, with more forecast for today. Stevens Pass,
60 miles east of Seattle, got 17 inches Thursday on top of a foot
already on the ground, and forecasters predicted an additional 1 to
2 feet of snow there today.
   In Alabama, meanwhile, twin tornadoes ripped through two
mobile-home parks Thursday, destroying about 15 homes. Authorities
said 28 people were injured, including three boys who suffered
serious head injuries.
   Lesser winds caused damage in the Detroit suburbs. Gusts
reaching 60 mph ripped the roofs off a motel in Auburn Hills and a
video store in Livonia.
   No one was injured there, but in Indianapolis, a 54-year-old
woman was cut on the leg by flying glass when winds gusting to 50
mph blew out windows on two floors of the INB National Bank Tower.
   Utilities reported at least 84,000 customers lost power in
Michigan, 44,000 in Wisconsin and 10,000 in Illinois. In most
cases, power was back on today.
   Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, which got nearly 10
inches of snow, was closed for 13 hours Thursday because of
drifting snow and poor visibility.
   ``It was real close to a blizzard,'' said National Weather
Service meteorologist John Haase in Milwaukee.
   Airports in St. Louis and Detroit closed for shorter periods of
time, while O'Hare and Midway airports in Chicago remained open but
had at least half their flights canceled.
   Eleven people were struck by lightning in a factory parking lot
in Crystal Lake, Ill., 35 miles northwest of Chicago, and a 12th
person was struck in nearby Palatine. None was seriously injured.
   ``I feel lucky to be alive,'' said Apolonio Pena, 37, one of the
Precision Twist Drill Co. workers struck by lightning as they were
trying to help push cars out of 6 inches of new snow. The bolt hit
a telephone pole next to the plant and traveled through the snow.
   ``There was a big, loud boom and then a flash,'' Pena said. ``I
felt like I had been knocked down, but I was really standing up. It
was really strange. Sparks came out of my fingers.''
   Illinois state police closed 35- to 40-mile stretches of
Interstate 90 near Elgin and I-88 outside Aurora for two hours at
midday Thursday, said Sgt. Tami Haukedahl.
   The storm lashed southeastern Iowa with 45 mph winds that
whipped 5 inches of snow into a treacherous near-whiteout on roads
slick with ice.
   ``Not only is there zero visibility, but you can turn left and
not go left,'' said Bob Wilson, district manager for the American
Automobile Association's Motor Club of Iowa.
   Near Toledo, Ohio, two U.S. marshals were injured, one
seriously, when a tree fell on their car.
   But the storm also brought some benefits, drenching much of
northern and central Illinois with 1 to 2 inches of rain.
   ``That's a heavy rain for this time of year and we've been quite
dry ... so the farmers were happy to see the rain and snow,'' said
weather service forecaster Richard Koeneman.

   Government troops ordered people to stay
off the streets today and searched houses for Moslems waging a
violent campaign for Kashmir's secession from India, witnesses
reported.
   At least 70 people, mostly militant Moslems, have been killed
since Saturday, when the government launched a harsh crackdown on
Kashmiri separatists to halt escalating violence.
   Moslem boys defied the curfew and burned Indian flags after
daybreak today. A few hours later, a state government official
presided over a poorly attended ceremony on the 40th anniversary of
the founding of the Indian Republic.
   Journalists were confined to a hotel and warned that they would
be arrested and risked getting shot if they tried to leave.
   In downtown Srinagar, where earlier in the week Moslem crowds
frequently defied the curfew confining them to their homes, troops
refused to let anyone outside. People who started to open their
windows were ordered to shut them.
   Only security forces and a few top officials were allowed
outdoors.
   The stepped-up security coincided with the weekly Islamic holy
day, often a boiling point for militant Moslems, and the 40th
anniversary celebration.
   On Jan. 26, 1950, newly independent India forged together under
one constitution an assortment of provinces once ruled by Britain
and princely states headed by maharajahs and nawabs.
   The holiday was denounced as a ``black day'' by the Moslem
separatists, who want to secede from predominantly Hindu India and
become independent or join neighboring Pakistan, an Islamic nation.
   From various vantage points in Srinagar, a city of 1 million
people, only heavily armed troops and an occasional government
official could be seen on the streets.
   United News of India quoted an official spokesman as saying nine
people were killed and 14 wounded on Thursday in Handwara, 40 miles
northwest of Srinagar. Unofficial sources has said Thursday night
that three people were killed when troops fired on a rioting mob.
   Sources who were contacted by telephone from Jammu, the state's
winter capital, said troops conducted house-to-house searches in
several parts of Srinagar and the nearby towns of Anantnag and
Baramulla.
   Several Moslem youths were detained, the sources said,
stipulating that they not be identified further.
   Kashmir is the toughest challenge Prime Minister V.P. Singh has
faced since he took office Dec. 2. Six days later, Moslem
extremists abducted the daughter of Singh's home minister, Kashmiri
Moslem Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, and held her until the government
freed five jailed Moslem militants.
   The separatist violence escalated as the miliants attacked
patrols and set fire to government buildings. An around-the-clock
curfew was imposed Saturday in Srinagar and surrounding towns.
   Hundreds, if not thousands, of troops were dispatched.
   The federal government last week appointed Jagmohan, a Hindu who
uses only one name and who is known as a tough administrator, as
governor in Jammu-Kashmir and gave him authority over elected state
officials.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Indian state with a Moslem majority.

<TEXT>
   Asians began welcoming the Year of the Horse
today with family gatherings and predictions of surging gold prices
and global instability.
   Across mainland China, people hurried home from work early to
begin the four-day holiday, China's biggest festival.
   The Year of the Snake gives way to the Year of the Horse on
Saturday.
   The eve of Lunar New Year is the only day of the year that
Chinese police are allowed to drink on the job, and those who
patrol the streets around the Beijing Train Station joined the rest
of the nation today in celebration.
   Hong Kong's noisy street markets were jammed with last-minute
shoppers buying food, flowers, watermelon seeds, nuts and candy
from merchants happily charging up to three times normal prices
before the city shuts down for the weekend.
   Hong Kong astrologer Andrew Yau predicted the coming year will
bring more rainfall, some instability, and _ for local businessmen
always looking for an investment tip _ rising gold prices.
   After fluctuating for the first half of the year, ``the gold
price definitely will rise very much, perhaps more than 50 percent.
On the other hand, the dollar is to devalue,'' Yau said.
   President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan forecast in his New Year's
message that the Communist rulers of mainland China will face the
same fate as their counterparts in Eastern Europe.
   ``Several Communist authoritarian regimes were overthrown in the
past year. We believe Chinese Communists will face the same fate
soon,'' Lee said.
   In Beijing, tens of thousands of people turned out for the first
day of the Longtan Park temple fair, which offered a variety of
``Beijing-style snacks'' from spicy pancakes to small eggs
deep-fried on a stick and candied crab apples.
   Gamblers could try their hand at roulette, and children could
ride in a dog-drawn cart for 20 cents.
   But by nightfall, the city train station was nearly empty, with
uniformed and plainclothes police outnumbering travelers. Many
stores had begun to close as families gathered for traditional
holiday meals.
   Police at the station passed around the ``white liquor,''
120-proof firewater, during their Lunar New Year lunch.
   In preparation for the holiday, China's leaders have made visits
to the provinces, bringing greetings to workers in coal mines and
factories and visiting soldiers to thank them for helping to put
down spring's pro-democracy movement.
   Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, during a six-day tour of
Shanxi province, in northern China, emphasized the role of the
working class and said socialism will triumph in China if ``we
learn from (their) spirit of fearing no hardship and quietly
contributing to the country and the people.''
   Such exhortations have been common since last year's
pro-democracy movement, which was violently crushed by the military.
   Hong Kong buildings were decorated with colorful New Year's
greetings while tangerine trees, narcissus and other plants
considered auspicious adorned many doorways.
   Hundreds of thousands of the British colony's 5.7 million people
jammed the airport, ferry terminals and the border crossing into
China as they left the territory to visit relatives or take
vacations.

<TEXT>
   The military government, which has barred
several top opposition leaders from running in Burma's next
election, said today that American observers will not be allowed to
monitor the balloting.
   The announcement came as students in the country's two largest
cities demonstrated this week to support an opposition leader who
was banned from participating in the elections, Western diplomats
said today.
   Heavy fighting, meanwhile, was reported between government
troops and Karen rebels along the Thailand border. Sixty fighters
were killed and 25 injured in five days of fighting in which
government troops overrun one rebel base and part of another,
police said today. Thousands of civilians fled the fighting.
   The elections set for May 27 are to be the first multiparty
parliamentary vote since 1960. But in the past month, the three
main opposition figures have been excluded from running.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., asked for a U.S. team to
be allowed to witness the election, the U.S.-funded Voice of
America reported Thursday.
   Asked about the report, a government spokesman, Col. Aung Thein,
told a news conference today: ``Where is the need to come and
observe the election, since he has already presumed that it will
not be free and fair?''
   The spokesman said 2,392 candidates were contesting the election
because they believed it would be fair.
   ``It is futile and meaningless to say the election would not be
free and fair simply because one or two of the candidates are not
participating because they infringed the election law,'' he said.
   On Jan. 16, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, co-leader of the National
League for Democracy, was disqualified after being linked by the
government with a student rebel group. She has been under house
arrest since July.
   Also barred has been Tin Oo, the group's other leader. He was
sentenced by a military tribunal to three years imprisonment on
charges of subversion.
   U Nu, the last democratically elected premier, was put under
house arrest and also banned from the balloting.
   The Western diplomats said groups of students on bicycles held
rallies in the country's second most populous city, Mandalay, in
recent days to back Ms. Suu Kyi. The protesters waved the flag of
her party and shouted slogans, the diplomats in Rangoon said in
telephone interviews, speaking anonymously.
   Young people also assembled in groups of 30 or 40 in violation
of martial law, which prohibits gatherings of more than five
people, one diplomat said.
   Mandalay, 350 miles north of Rangoon, was a center of the huge
pro-democracy demonstrations that lasted several months in 1988
before the military crushed them. Hundreds of people were killed.
   One diplomat reported that there were also street protests in
the capital on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
   He cited unconfirmed reports that at least 50 protesters had
been arrested.
   Burma has been ruled by martial law since September 1988, when
Gen. Saw Maung seized power in a coup and suppressed the
pro-democracy movement.
   Since then, thousands of dissidents have been detained, casting
doubt on the regime's pledge of a free and fair election.
   In the fighting along the border, 1,500 Burmese troops began
attacking the Karen bases of The Ba Bow and nearby Maeng Ka Ra on
Saturday, border police sources said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   They captured Maeng Ka Ra and part The Ba Bow, the sources said.
Both camps are close to Thailand's northwestern border.
   About 30 fighters on each side were reported killed and 20
Burmese and five Karen rebels wounded, the police said.
   Fighting has raged in the surrounding area since Jan. 17 and has
sent 5,000 Karen civilians fleeing across the Thai border. Thai
villagers living on the frontier also have fled to escape the
fighting, the sources said.
   The Karens are one of the largest of the diverse ethnic groups
fighting the Burmese government. They have resisted the integration
of the the Karen state into the Union of Burma since Rangoon gained
independence from Britain in 1948.

   A Colombian jetliner on a landing
approach radioed that an engine had gone out before it crashed in
heavy fog and rain, killing at least 67 of 158 people aboard and
scattering bodies across a wooded hillside, authorities said today.
   Helicopters lifted bloodied passengers to hospitals as a priest
gave last rites on the ground early this morning.
   ``I gave them rosaries and said little prayers,'' said the Rev.
Daniel Ahern of St. Pius V Roman Catholic Church in Oyster Bay.
``They were crying and asking about their family members.''
   Avianca Flight 52, a Boeing 707, was carrying 149 passengers and
nine crew members when it crashed Thursday night on its second
approach to John F. Kennedy International Airport, the airline said
in a statement from Bogota.
   ``There were bodies on top of bodies on top of bodies,'' said
Jeff Race, 26, a New York City paramedic who lives a half-mile
away. He said he was the first rescuer at the scene. ``Some were
alive, some were dead. Limbs were bent every way you can imagine.''
   ``People were screaming. ... Most of them were still strapped in
their seats,'' he said. ``It was just mangled, twisted metal.''
   The 23-year-old jetliner, more than 90 minutes late from Bogota
after a stop in Medellin, Colombia, broke into at least three
pieces. Rescuers arrived to find passengers scrambling out of exits.
   Dr. George Dunn of Glen Cove Community Hospital said the number
of survivors was so high because the airplane didn't catch on fire.
Authorities this morning could not confirm a Cable News Network
report that the plane ran out of fuel before it crashed.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators were on the
scene but had not commented.
   Boeing spokesman Tom Cole said the 707 model is capable of
carrying about 24,000 gallons of fuel, which gives it range of
6,000 miles. ``It has plenty of capability to fly from Colombia to
New York.''
   Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Diane Spitaliere
said the plane pulled away from a landing approach at 9:24 p.m. for
unknown reasons. At 9:32 p.m., she said, the plane reported to the
Kennedy tower that its No. 2 engine had gone out. At 9:34 p.m., the
tower lost contact with the plane, and the crash occurred moments
later, Spitaliere said.
   The death toll as of midmorning was 67, and it was not clear how
many crew members survived, said Port Authority Police Officer
Michael Palermo.
   The plane's flight and voice recorders were recovered, Thomas
Gulotta, the Nassau County executive, said.
   Authorities created a makeshift morgue on the front lawn of a
mansion owned by the parents of tennis star John McEnroe, about a
quarter-mile from the crash. The bodies were wrapped in white
plastic and lined in rows.
   Aleta Heidt of Wyckoff, N.J., said her husband was on the plane,
bringing home two adoptive children. The husband and at least one
child survived, she said. She said she believed several children
being adopted were on the flight.
   Race said most of those killed or severely injured were ``from
the front of the plane, where the fuselage had separated apart.''
   By early today, 92 people had been taken to hospitals, according
to Sgt. James Callahan of the Nassau County Police Emergency
Medical Bureau.
   Nassau County Police spokesman Officer Peter Franzone said at
least 78 people survived the crash. Among those hospitalized were
15 children, many carried from the crash scene crying.
   ``What a way to come to America,'' one of the passengers told
rescue worker Jay Krul, 30, of Oyster Bay.
   The plane went down about 15 miles northeast of the airport
after a five-hour flight, said Port Authority Police Officer Phil
Montouri.
   The crash occurred just off Oyster Bay Harbor in an exclusive
Nassau County hamlet on the north shore of Long Island. It's near
the former home of President Theodore Roosevelt, now a national
historic site.
   Rescuers laid ladders up the steep wooded hillside, where part
of the fuselage came to rest, then passed the survivors down.
   ``The fuselage was cracked open near the top of the plane.
That's how we got access to the survivors,'' said firefighter Tom
Czajkowski. ``You could hear people crying and screaming.
   ``A lot of passengers were dead and a lot were in shock. Some of
them were talking to us _ we told them to hang in there, we'd get
them out.''
   Alfred Williams, an off-duty New York policeman, said one
passenger told him that the plane's engines went dead and the
aircraft crashed soon after.
   ``As soon as they hit the ground he flew out the front of the
second part of the fuselage and started running in fear that the
plane was going to blow up,'' Williams said. ``And he realized that
he had to go back for his wife and his daughter, he said.
   ``And he said he just couldn't. He collapsed. He had two broken
legs.''
   Anxious relatives waiting at the airport viewed television news
pictures of the crash.
   Amanda Pinzon, 27, of Elizabeth, N.J., who was waiting in the
Pan Am terminal lounge with relatives who had come to meet the
plane, cried with joy when she saw her husband, Jesus, and
2-year-old son, Brian, on television, among the survivors being
taken to hospitals.
   ``I feel great, I'm so happy _ happy, crying, everything,'' she
said.
   Matt Murphy, agent on duty at the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration office in New York, said the DEA has not received
any threats against Colombian airliners recently. He noted that the
plane was close to its destination when it crashed, which he said
was an indication that sabotage was not involved.
   On Nov. 27, an Avianca Boeing 727 was bombed out of the sky
minutes after takeoff from Bogota on a domestic flight to Cali. The
explosion killed all 107 people on board.
   The Extraditables group, drug traffickers fearing extradition to
the United States, took responsibility for the bombing in a phone
call to the Colombian radio network Caracol.

   Shrill sirens pierced the fog-shrouded
skies and helicopters hovered overhead as rescue workers scrambled
to pull survivors from the wreckage of a Colombian jetliner.
   Minutes after the Avianca Boeing 707 crashed Thursday night on a
hillside in this exclusive Long Island village, word went out to
dozens of volunteer fire departments, sending a stream of
fire-fighting apparatus and ambulances to the site.
   The plane's nose smashed into the deck of the home of Sam
Tiesenbaum and his wife. They said the house shook and there was a
sound like thunder. ``We thought it was an earthquake,'' they told
authorities.
   Arriving rescue workers heard the screams of trapped passengers,
who moaned in pain and cried out to loved ones in Spanish.
   ``Kids were screaming for their parents. Parents were screaming
for their kids,'' said Robert LaBella, a nearby resident who helped
remove six people from the wreckage. After that, ``I just couldn't
take it anymore.''
   Larry Rubinstein, a rescue volunteer, said the scene was ``very
chaotic.'' But he and others said an odd sense of order set in as
passengers realized they had survived, and rescue crews went to
work.
   ``It was very crazy at first but the police got things under
control and everybody started the task of getting everyone, the
survivors, out of the aircraft,'' Rubinstein said.
   Morris Benny of the East Norwich Fire Department said some
survivors ``were already sitting on the plane. A couple were trying
to walk out.''
   Scores of the passengers aboard the Avianca flight from Bogota,
Colombia, to Kennedy International Airport were injured. At least
67 of the passengers and crew among the more than 140 aboard were
killed.
   After a hectic night of life-and-death urgency, rescuers this
morning worked in a cold drizzle, using pneumatic chisels to pry
away wreckage.
   First word of the crash reached the Nassau County Fire
Communications Center at 9:44 p.m., said supervisor Paul E. Simon.
The center quickly dispatched 20 of the county's volunteer fire
departments to the scene. Eight others were on standby. Units from
the Emergency Medical Service came from New York City.
   ``As far as how many people were involved, I couldn't say,''
Simon said.
   The plane, broken in three places, came to rest on a steep,
wooded hillside on a peninsula that juts into Long Island Sound, a
neighborhood dotted with million-dollar estates. Trees 60 to 80
feet tall and thick as a telephone pole had been snapped off.
   The remote location complicated the rescue effort.
   Rescuers laid ladders up the hillside to reached the splintered
fuselage and formed a human chain, passing survivors down the
hillside. They set up a makeshift morgue on the front lawn of a
home owned by the parents of tennis star John McEnroe.
   ``You could hear people crying and screaming,'' firefighter Tom
Czajkowski said. ``A lot of passengers were dead and a lot were in
shock. Some of them were talking to us. We told them to hang in
there, we'd get them out.''
   Simon said the crush of rescue equipment and onlookers clogged
the windy, two-lane road leading to the crash site. ``We had a
gridlock problem. ... We couldn't get the ambulances in,'' he said.
   Workers tried to reassure passengers as they worked to free them
from the crushed seats inside the plane.
   ``I told them in my broken Spanish that they were lucky and we
would get them out,'' said Dr. George Dunn. ``They were not
hysterical, just mostly in shock.''
   Soon, helicopters were shuttling the injured from the crash site
and caravans of ambulances made their way to and from the scene.
   Peter Dowd of the Syosset Fire Department said he worked his way
into the plane through the rear and spent 1{ hours inside while
about 25 passengers were extricated. He said he helped support an
American passenger who was having difficulty breathing.
   The passenger told him the aircraft had been circling before the
crash, then suddenly lost lighting and power.
   ``They went down like an escalator,'' Dowd said the woman told
him.

<HEAD>Medical Students Report They're Abused; Many Considered Dropping

   Medical students are often shouted at and
occasionally physically threatened in the course of their training,
according to two studies.
   ``It's a lot like child abuse,'' said Dr. DeWitt Baldwin, who
directs medical education research for the American Medical
Association. He co-wrote one of two studies in today's Journal of
the American Medical Association. ``We knew it was there, but we
somehow couldn't believe it.''
   In a survey of 75 third-year medical students, 85 percent said
they had been ``yelled or shouted at'' at least once during
training, wrote Baldwin and researchers at the University of South
Florida in Tampa. In some cases, the yelling came from patients,
but most frequently, it was another medical staff member or a
teacher doing the yelling, the survey found.
   The same percentage also said they had been humiliated or
subjected to inappropriately nasty or hostile behavior, the
researchers reported.
   More alarming, 24 percent of the students said they had been
physically threatened, most frequently by patients, and 16 percent
said they'd actually been physically abused _ either slapped,
kicked, hit or had things thrown at them.
   Most women students, 81 percent, said they had been subject to
sexism, most often by clinical faculty and residents or interns.
More than half _ 55 percent _ said they had been targets of
unwelcome sexual advances.
   Half of the non-white students said they had endured racial or
ethnic slurs, though none reported being denied opportunities
because of race or ethnicity.
   More than two-thirds of those surveyed felt that mistreatment in
their training had interfered with their emotional health, and 37
percent seriously considered leaving medical school as a result,
the study said.
   Co-author K. Harnett Sheehan conceded that verbal abuse of
medical students is an ``age-old problem,'' but suggested the
studies may prompt efforts to make the ``medical school environment
a more pleasant, more attractive place.''
   Dr. Henry Silver, co-author of an accompanying study, said he
found students were abused far more often than he had expected.
   Silver, an associate dean for admissions at the University of
Colorado School of Medicine in Denver, and his colleagues surveyed
431 students. Four out of every five students reported mistreatment
at some time during their medical education.
   Sixteen percent said they had been so affected by the abuse that
they would carry it with them for the rest of their lives.
   Silver's study defined abuse as avoidable treatment that is
harmful, injurious or offensive, and included such things as verbal
attacks.
   The study recounted the experience of one student who asked his
superior to allow him to stop examining the eye of a fellow student
who ``was in obvious pain.''
   ``When I explained this to the supervising physician, he said,
`Oh good, this gives us an opportunity to learn how to force a
patient to cooperate even if they are in pain.'''
   Researchers in both studies emphasized that the schools they
surveyed _ the University of Colorado School of Medicine and the
University of South Florida College of Medicine _ were typical of
medical schools.
   They said both schools have started to amend their programs so
that future students may not be mistreated.
   In an editorial in this week's Journal, Dr. Jerald Kay urges
medical schoools to educate their faculty and staff on students'
rights and to make provisions for those who abuse others.

<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with claim of nine casualties in

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Palestinian guerrilla group claimed it
killed or wounded nine Israeli soldiers today after ambushing an
Israeli patrol in south Lebanon. The Israeli army denied any of its
soldiers were hurt.
   Also today, an Israeli soldier was wounded in a separate attack
when a roadside bomb exploded under his tank in south Lebanon.
   The Marxist-oriented Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine said it ambushed the Israeli patrol at 6 a.m. in a narrow
valley near the village of Taibeh in Israeli's self-declared
security zone.
   ``The Zionist enemy and its surrogates of the South Lebanon Army
militia rushed tank-led reinforcements to the confrontation region
in an effort to encircle our comrades, who had succeeded in wiping
out the Israeli patrol,'' the Palestinian group said in its
statement.
   A later statement from the group sent to The Associated Press in
Cyprus said nine Israelis were killed or wounded in the ambush and
that the attack was in retaliation for an Israeli air raid Thursday
on Palestinian targets in Lebanon. One man was killed and three
people wounded in that raid.
   The Israeli army said today's battle was ``not a major
incident.''
   A military statement said the Israeli soldiers ``came under
light arms fire. Soldiers in the force sustained no casualties and
returned fire at the source of the shooting.''
   In the southern village of Barachit, also in the security zone,
an Israeli soldier was wounded when a mine went off near his tank,
the Israeli army and Lebanese security sources said. Israel radio
said the officer was slightly wounded.
   Israel has controlled the security zone, a strip of land six to
10 miles wide along the border, since its invasion of Lebanon in
1982. It kept the area as a buffer against border attacks when it
withdrew most of its army in 1985.

   An argument between two inmates
escalated into a full-scale brawl between black and Hispanic
prisoners at an overcrowded county jail, and three inmates were
seriously injured, officials said.
   Prisoners wielding hand-made knives and other crude weapons
attacked each other for about 15 minutes Thursday before jail
deputies forced them back into their cells, sheriff's Capt. Ben
McLaughlin said.
   It was the second such disturbance in as many months in the same
cellblock at the El Cajon Detention Facility. The jail is designed
to hold 120 prisoners but held more than 500 inmates Thursday.
   Inmates retreated to their cells when deputies entered the
cellblock armed with electronic stun-guns and a weapon that fires
rubber bullets.
   One injured inmate was flown by helicopter to Sharp Memorial
Hospital, where he was listed in critical condition with head
injuries, said spokeswoman Melanie Bruce. Two other inmates were
admitted to the UCSD Medical Center with head injuries, one in
serious condition and one in fair condition, said spokeswoman Jane
Swett. Both spokeswomen declined to release the names of the
prisoners.
   Nine other inmates suffered cuts, scrapes and other minor
injuries and were returned to jail after treatment at eastern San
Diego County hospitals, officials said.
   Deputies said they saw a black inmate arguing with a Hispanic
inmate moments before their confrontation turned violent.
   ``It was a racial issue, but we're not sure yet what sparked
it,'' McLaughlin said.
   On Dec. 13, feuding black and Hispanic inmates tore apart
furniture in the same cellblock and used the pieces of furniture as
weapons. Four inmates were seriously injured in that melee.
   El Cajon is 20 miles east of downtown San Diego.

   More than 500 United Mine Workers members
marched two miles up Rum Creek Hollow today to protest non-union
work at a coal preparation plant.
   The half-hour rally was held at a private bridge leading to the
Rum Creek Coal Sales Inc. plant, the site of confrontations earlier
this week.
   It was the largest gathering of UMW miners since June, when a
rally in Charleston attracted more than 1,000 miners, the union
said. That march triggered wildcat strikes the next day, which
eventually idled 43,000 miners in 10 states.
   Today's march came one day after the UMW celebrated the 100th
anniversary of its founding.
   ``Our focus is to bring public attention and bring justice to
people in the coal fields,'' said Bob Phalen, president of UMW
District 17.
   Cars and pickup trucks lined West Virginia 10, about 70 miles
southeast of Charleston, and state police escorted the miners two
miles from a parking lot to the bridge. No violence was reported.
   Miners struck Rum Creek in mid-August after the A.T. Massey Coal
Co. subsidiary re-opened the preparation plant with non-union
contractors. Union men had run operations there.
   The march temporarily disrupted traffic on a side road leading
from West Virginia 10, but miners cleared the road and allowed
traffic to flow.
   State troopers had advised the miners not to block the public
road. The union already was under court order not to block an
adjacent private road leading to the plant.
   Many miners wore camouflage clothing to show their solidarity.
They said they were prepared to be arrested.
   ``If that's what they want us to do, we'll do it. It's one for
all and all for one in the United Mine Workers,'' said Bill
Humphrey of Whitesville, who carried a framed copy of the
Declaration of Independence.
   Humphrey works at New Beckley Coal Co., where the UMW has been
on strike for nearly a year. About 100 of his co-workers also
attended the rally.
   ``I get emotional over stuff like this,'' said Bill Ingram, a
40-year veteran of the Rum Creek plant.
   Miners picketing the Rum Creek plant have blocked the road with
cars and trucks. On Monday and Tuesday, company coal trucks plowed
the vehicles out of the way. On Wednesday, federal marshals had
them towed away.
   Two UMW members were arraigned in Charleston Thursday on charges
of assaulting federal marshals Wednesday and freed on $25,000
secured bonds. A third UMW member was freed on $10,000 unsecured
bond after being charged with violating the court order.
   On Thursday about 60 pickets gathered at the site but allowed
the trucks to pass without incident.
   The Rum Creek strike is not related to the 9-month-old strike
against the Pittston Coal Group, which was tentatively settled Jan.
1. The proposed pact has not yet been submitted for ratification by
the rank and file.

<TEXT>
   Striking black railway workers
and management have reached a tentative agreement in a 12-week-old
walkout that has claimed more than 30 lives and resulted in
millions of dollars in property damage, a mediator said today.
   Charles Nupen, director of Independent Mediation Services, said
management of the state-owned South African Transport Services and
officials of the South African Railways and Harbor Workers Union
would review the document today and planned to sign it Saturday.
   Nupen said in a statement that the company has agreed to
recognize the union, which has been one of the demands by the
25,000 strikers. However, the statement made no mention of a pay
hike.
   The strikers, who walked off the job Nov. 2, wanted the minimum
monthly wage increased from $240 to $600.
   The company and the union declined to comment on the tentative
accord.
   The company fired almost all the strikers, but it has agreed to
rehire them, Nupen said.
   The strike has been one of the most violent ever in South
Africa, with numerous battles between strikers and non-strikers and
dozens of incidents in which railway coaches and track have been
sabotaged.
   The company says it has suffered property damage of $16 million.
   The strike is illegal under legislation that bars industrial
action against essential services. The transport company employs
about 170,000 people and runs rail and harbor operations nationwide.

<HEAD>Communist Leaders Agree to Multiparty System, Democracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist leaders, under pressure to end
one-party rule in Bulgaria, hurriedly adopted a new platform
embracing a multiparty system and social democracy, the BTA news
agency said today.
   The program was drawn up late Thursday during a meeting called
after several days of labor unrest, the official news agency said.
   BTA gave few details of the hastily convened Central Committee
meeting. It said only that 20 members spoke and heard a concluding
speech from party leader Petar Mladenov, the former foreign
minister who took over after hard-liner Todor Zhivkov was ousted
Nov. 10.
   The report said the platform commits the Communists, who have
ruled alone since the late 1940s, to pluralism and social democracy
and is to be voted on at a party congress next week. A showdown
between reformers and more orthodox Communists is expected at the
congress.
   The Communist Party in Bulgaria, drawing on a century of
tradition and facing a relatively weak opposition, has not
collapsed or abandoned power as swiftly as others in Eastern Europe.
   But labor unrest, virtually unknown in Bulgaria since World War
II, has spread since Zhivkov's ouster. Sofia bus drivers and coal
miners were among those on strike this week, demanding higher pay
or better working conditions.
   Finance Minister Belcho Belchev appealed on national television
Thursday night for an end to the strikes and said Bulgaria will
face ``disastrous losses'' if they continue.
   Productivity dropped 13 percent in December compared with 1989,
he said.
   Zhivkov was arrested last week on allegations of abuse of power
during his more than three decades in power. No date for the trial
of the 78-year-old former leader has been announced.
   The party daily Rabotnichesko Delo said today that while Zhivkov
was in power, he ordered charges to be filed against his
daughter-in-law, Maroussya Mirchevska, who was accused of trying to
defect with her young son.
   It said Mrs. Mirchevska was forced to live in the Soviet Union
for five years. It did not say what had happened to the child, now
10 years old, but printed what it said was a plea from the woman to
be reunited with her son.

<HEAD>NYC Schools Lead Nation in Westinghouse Science Finalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York's Stuyvesant High School has again led
the nation in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search, after almost
missing the contest when entries were misplaced by Federal Express
last month.
   Stuyvesant had 39 of the 303 semifinalists announced Thursday in
the national contest and five finalists. New York City schools
again did well, with 109 semifinalists and 14 of 40 finalists.
   ``We have extraordinarily gifted kids and we try to cater a
program to their skills,'' said Stuyvesant principal Abraham
Baumel. Hundreds of students work on projects and 161 from the
school entered this year.
   Federal Express mislaid 71 of the school's entries, causing them
to miss the filing deadline. But Westinghouse officials allowed
them, saying it wasn't the students' fault.
   ``It's marvelous _ everyone is just thrilled that such a
wonderful result did take place,'' said Baumel. He said it was not
known how many of the semifinalists or finalists were from the late
entries.
   Bronx High School of Science also had five finalists, out of
only 35 entries. It had 19 semifinalists.
   The 40 finalists will compete for $140,000 in scholarships in
Washington from March 1-5. The top prize is a $20,000 scholarship.
   Stuyvesant, Bronx Science and Brooklyn Technical High School
attract the city's best science students through competitive tests.
Brooklyn Technical had two finalists. Midwood High School in
Brooklyn and Van Buren High School in Queens had one apiece.
   ``It must be the water system,'' joked Charles Carroll, a
spokesman for the search. By comparison, the entire states of
California and Maryland landed four finalists apiece.
   Among the finalists from Stuyvesant were Alexander Sragovich,
17, who studied the genetic alteration of antibodies; Esther Chen,
17, who investigated a gene that triggers cell multiplication; and
James Chien-Hsun Liao, 18, who studied a genetic agent in bacteria.
   Stuyvesant has had the largest number of National Merit Scholars
of any single school in the country, 77, and set the record for
Westinghouse semifinalists, 47, two years ago, Baumel said.
   The school with the next-largest number of semifinalists was
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in
Alexandria, Va., with 14.

<HEAD>France Suspends Aid to Haiti</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ France suspended aid to Haiti and
broke off talks on a new $500 million aid package to protest human
rights violations by the Caribbean country's military government,
French officials said today.
   French Minister of Cooperation Jacques Pelletier canceled a
visit scheduled for last Monday after the president, Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril, decreed a 30-day state of siege, a French Embassy
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   More than 50 political leaders have been arrested since the
weekend. Most have been released, but several have been exiled to
the United States or France, and a radical political leader was
reported missing on Thursday.
   France, which once controlled Haiti, was the most generous
international donor to Haiti in 1989, giving $50 million for
financing development projects.
   Aid continued at about the same level this year, although an aid
package valued at $500 million during the next two years was to
have been negotiated at the suspended meeting of the Haitian-French
Cooperation Commission, said a Haitian official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said current payments to
Haiti also were being cut.
   France took the action because of ``the scope of human rights
violations and the interruption of public liberties in Haiti,'' the
ministry said in a statement.
   French officials will be consulting with other aid donors ``to
examine measures that might lead Gen. Avril to respect his promises
to restore democracy,'' it said.
   It said France has intervened to obtain the release of some
people who were arrested and to try to make sure they were not
physically mistreated.
   ``France asks the Haitian government urgently to re-establish
the suspended provisions of the Constitution, to reverse the
measures of detention and banishment of opposition leaders and to
guarantee the restarting of an authentic election process,'' the
statement said.
   When reporters asked Avril on Thursday when he would lift the
state of siege, he frowned and said: ``It could be tomorrow.''
   He commented after a brief ceremony at the National Palace in
which Guy Mendes Binheiro Vaconcellos, the new Brazilian
ambassador, presented his credentials.
   Avril also repeated his promise to hold elections, now scheduled
for October. ``We are on the way to elections,'' he said, without
elaborating.
   Critics accuse Avril of using the killing on Saturday of Col.
Andre Neptune, his wife and a servant by unidentified assailants as
a pretext to crack down on the opposition and renege on elections.
   Avril did not say whether seven prominent civic leaders and
militants expelled since Saturday would be allowed to return if the
state of siege is lifted.
   Rockefeller Guerre, head of the leftist Union of Patriotic
Democrats Party and an outspoken critic of Avril, was reported
missing by his wife.
   ``I haven't heard from my husband since Monday and I am worried
because he always told me he would never go into hiding,'' Mrs.
Guerre said in an interview. She said she thought he may have been
arrested.
   Haiti received $154 million in international assistance in 1988,
but had been the object of international ostracism since the Nov.
29, 1987, election-day massacre staged by thugs working with the
army.
   The U.S. government cut off about two-thirds of its $90 million
aid package after the 1987 massacre.
   Haiti still receives about $40 million in U.S. aid through
numerous private voluntary organizations.
   To encourage the government's stated commitment to democracy,
the U.S. government granted $10 million in free wheat under the
Food for Peace Program last year. The United States also granted
$500,000 to assist the Avril government in fighting drug smuggling.

   Members of the Soviet parliament's opposition
group condemned the government today for failing to quell ethnic
violence in the Caucasus and for relying on force instead of more
negotiations.
   Azerbaijani activists, meanwhile, said commandos raided the
republic's mission in Moscow overnight and arrested a nationalist
leader. A Moscow police spokesman confirmed the raid and said it
was being investigated.
   A newspaper also reported today that President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev was warned by two senior Soviet military leaders not to
send troops into Azerbaijan just hours before the soldiers were
deployed.
   Thirteen members of the Inter-Regional Group of progressive
deputies in the Soviet Congress issued a declaration saying
authorities took action ``too late'' in the simmering conflict
between Azerbaijanis and Armenians.
   They proposed an emergency session of the Supreme Soviet, the
government's standing legislature, to mediate the dispute, and
called for a deadline for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Azerbaijan.
   The unrest and the government's delayed, armed reaction to it
``represent a threat to perestroika,'' the Kremlin's program of
reforms, deputy Sergei Stankevich said.
   The opposition group claims about 400 members of the
2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies. Its leaders include
reformer Boris N. Yeltsin, who was not at the news conference, and
historian Yuri N. Afanasyev. It was created largely under the
inspiration of late Nobel-Prize-winning, human rights advocate
Andrei D. Sakharov. Although the group represents a clear minority
in the Congress, its initiatives occasionally have won majority
support.
   The group's declaration said the Azerbaijani government was at
fault for losing people' trust, and added: ``We are categorically
against the use of force for the artifical preservation of such
regimes.''
   Soviet troops moved into the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, on
Saturday to quell the nationalist uprising and attacks on Armenians
there.
   The violence was the culmination of a two-year dispute between
mainly Christian Armenians and Moslem Azerbaijanis over their
respective claims to Nagorno-Karabakh, an Azerbaijani enclave
populated mainly by ethnic Armenians.
   The dispute has fueled the independence movements in the
neighboring Soviet republics, which are among several seeking
automony from Moscow.
   Two senior Soviet officers in Baku warned hours before Gorbachev
sent troops to Azerbaijan that an assault would turn the population
against the army and ethnic Russians, a newspaper reported today.
   The two Afghan war veterans said in a telegram sent Jan. 19 that
bringing in troops would lead ``to a total break in relations and
put their families in danger,'' as well as ``creating a growth in
the anti-Russian mood.''
   That same night, Soviet troops raided the Azerbaijani capital.
By latest count, 101 people have died since then, and more than 171
overall in the unrest that began with anti-Armenian attacks in Baku
two weeks ago.
   The dangers predicted by Cols. A. Savelyev and A. Rusakov, top
officials in a Baku military academy, have been realized and more
than 30,000 family members of Soviet soldiers have had to be
evacuated, said the youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
   Meanwhile, Azerbaijani activists said today that police twice
raided the Azerbaijani government's building in Moscow during the
night and arrested a leader of the nationalist Azerbaijani People's
Front, Ekhtibar Mamedov.
   Moscow Deputy Police Chief Lev Belyansky confirmed the raid but
said he would give no more information until the investigation was
done, Tass reported.
   Activist Shain Gajiyev said commandos charged into the
government mission at 3 a.m., searched it and herded about 40
Azerbaijani men into buses. He said all were released except
Mamedov, who has gained attention recently by pushing Azerbaijani
claims that there were far more people killed in the troops'
assault on Baku than the official death toll.
   In Baku, military commandant Lt. Gen. Vladimir Dubinyak said
today the situation was ``relatively calm,'' the Soviet news agency
Tass reported.
   In the last 24 hours, 147 people had been detained in Baku
either for breaking curfew or other violations, Tass said, and two
newspapers were banned by military authorities. The agency said
troops did not use weapons Thursday, but Komsomolskaya Pravda
reported two people killed in Baku when an armored personnel
carrier ran over a car.
   Shooting also continued around a barracks where, according to
some reports, Azerbaijani troops are fighting Soviets. Military
authorities denied Azerbaijani soldiers turned against the army.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda ventured some of the first criticism in the
official Soviet press against the troops in Baku. It noted that
dozens of people had been hospitalized with accidental shooting
wounds blamed on the soldiers.
   ``We don't presume to advise the military, but after all, there
are other means of `imposing order,''; it said.
   Strikes continued to paralyze much of Baku, but Soviet media
said many stores had opened for the first time since the Jan. 20
assault. Azerbaijanis have pledged not to end their strikes until
Soviet troops withdraw.
   A cease-fire agreed to Thursday by belligerents in the
Azerbaijan's Nakhichevan region was being observed, said journalist
Ashot Gazarian of the Armenian news agency Armenpress. He said
Azerbaijan's rail blockade of Armenia was continuing.

<TEXT>
   Parliament today heeded warnings to avoid
vindictiveness and dropped consideration of a law that would have
allowed the government to take control of the Communist Party's
considerable wealth.
   The Sejm, or Parliament, voted 246-29 to withdraw the draft law,
which was submitted by legislators who advocated radical moves to
regain for the national treasury the buildings, companies, cars and
other property amassed by the Communists during four decades of
rule.
   Communist Party buildings in several cities have been occupied
by members of the public who want to regain the property.
   The occupiers, often young members of radical opposition groups,
have demanded that the property be given to universities or other
public use.
   Aleksander Hall, the Cabinet minister responsible for political
parties, denounced such action.
   ``We will not build a democratic Poland, we will not build a
democratic state, if the law is not the law,'' Hall said.
   He told legislators that accepting the draft law would be
``reminiscent of the road chosen by Communists after World War II.''
   The prime minister of the Solidarity-led government, Taduesz
Mazowiecki, urged that the temptation for revenge be rejected.
   The status of the wealth now will be decided by a commission
established by Mazowiecki. The commission met for the first time
Thursday and elicited a promise from the Communist Party's Central
Committee to submit a list of holdings by mid-February.
   Nearly 100 Solidarity members of Parliament had sponsored the
draft law to reclaim Communist Party holdings, but most withdrew
their backing after a lengthy caucus meeting Wednesday.
   Deputy Zygmunt Lupina said Thursday most deputies accepted
arguments presented by Hall during the caucus and bowed to the
prime minister's position that the question should be resolved in a
more orderly fashion.
   The Communists reacted to the draft law with a barrage of
commentaries in their daily newspaper and speeches contending they
were being unfairly attacked.
   ``The problem of party assets should be solved in a reasonable
way, not by robbery,'' First Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski said
Tuesday.
   Communist leaders have said they want to find new ways to use
their buildings and other property to support the party. They said
ownership disputes should be resolved in court.
   Opponents contend many holdings are not legally owned by the
party, which was able to accumulate property through its control of
the government.
   The property issue came to the fore as the Communists prepared
for the opening of their 11th national congress Saturday.
   The party, formally called the Polish United Workers Party, is
expected to be revived under a new name and given a new platform as
leaders try to find a place for it in Poland's democratic future.
   More than 40 years of Communist Party rule ended Aug. 23, 1989,
when Parliament approved a Solidarity-led coalition government
headed by Mazowiecki, a former opposition activist.
   The Communist Party in June lost control of the Parliament in
the freest elections in the East bloc in more than four decades.

<TEXT>
   President Bush appealed to the nation's mayors
today to support his drug-fighting strategy and said he would use
``the bully pulpit'' of the White House to ask Americans to
volunteer money and time for the effort.
   One day after proposing a $1.1 billion increase in antidrug
efforts, Bush said, ``I ask you to support our strategy to take
back the streets from crime and drugs.''
   Bush's address before a convention of the U.S. Conference of
Mayors drew muted applause. Democrats have complained that Bush's
package, totaling $10.6 billion, is not enough.
   The president said a recent poll demonstrates that Americans are
willing to volunteer more than 500 million hours per week in
antidrug efforts and $5 billion nationally.
   ``They want to serve. They want to give but they have to be
asked before they can do either,'' Bush said.
   ``I promise I will use the bully pulpit to ask them to do both
and I urge you to do the same thing. ... We need to get more
involved.
   ``Together, let's defeat public enemy No. 1.''
   Bush also renewed his call for mandatory prison terms for
firearms offenses and expansion of the death penalty for
drug-related crimes.
   ``Let's work together to stop the hooligans and the thugs,'' the
president said.
   Bush also called for support for his proposals for child care,
clean air, a capital gains tax cut, educational programs and
efforts to help the homeless.
   While acknowledging differences with the mayors over spending
levels, Bush said, ``The main thing is there is this willingness of
the heart, among Democrats and Republicans, the White House and the
mayors, a willingness to put aside partisan concerns.
   ``Let us sit down together and do what needs to be done to
achieve the promise of America,'' Bush said.

<TEXT>
   A close associate of ousted military
leader Manuel Antonio Noriega who topped the U.S. military's list
of most-wanted fugitives in Panama has been detained, officials
said today.
   American troops found Lt. Col. Luis ``Papo'' Cordova at a hotel
Thursday night after receiving a tip from neighbors, said Bill
Ormsbee, a U.S. Southern Command spokesman.
   After Noriega surrendered Jan. 3, Cordova became the fugitive
most sought by U.S. troops that invaded Panama on Dec. 20 to
capture Noriega and bring him to Miami to face federal drug charges.
   Another fugitive also was detained Thursday night, Ormsbee said
by telephone today. He identified him as Romulo Escobar
Bethancourt, who served as an adviser to a former Defense Forces
chief, Gen. Omar Torrijos.
   Noriega inherited command of the military after Torrijos, who
seized power in 1968, died in a plane crash in 1981.
   Ormsbee said law enforcement agents of the new Panamanian
government participated in arresting both men. He said they were
``in custody'' but did not say if charges had been filed.
   Cordova was transit director in Noriega's now-dismantled Defense
Forces. The new Panamanian government has accused him of
involvement in the 1985 assassination of Noriega opponent Hugo
Spadafora.
   All the high military officials in Noriega's government are
under arrest at Fort Clayton, a U.S. military base. Southern
Command sources have said that 60 Panamanians, most of them
military officials, are being held.

<TEXT>
   Former President Richard Nixon's long
involvement in U.S.-Chinese relations extended to the congressional
battle over the bill to allow Chinese students to remain in the
United States.
   Nixon, whose dramatic trip to Beijing in 1972 reopened American
ties with China, made telephone calls to five Republican senators
asking them to sustain Bush's veto of the bill. The veto was upheld
Thursday by a vote of 62-37, short of the two-thirds majority
needed.
   Among those receiving calls from the 37th president was Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., who also was called by President Bush while
on the phone with Nixon, said McCain's spokesman, Scott Celley.
   ``Yesterday afternoon he (Nixon) called the office and the
senator returned his call,'' Celley said. He declined to discuss
the details of the conversation.
   McCain voted to support Bush's override.
   Senate Minority Whip Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said Nixon ``was
involved'' in seeking support for Bush's veto.
   ``It's a very important issue to him,'' he said. ``He made two
calls that I'm aware of and he furnished me some information.''
   Nixon spent six days in Beijing last fall and said he had more
than 20 hours of discussions with Chinese leaders. He said he gave
the Bush administration an 18-page report on how to improve
relations in the wake of Chinese government's brutal crackdown in
June of pro-democracy dissidents.
   The former president discussed China ``in some detail'' with a
group of senators and former senators that he met with at a dinner
senators Robert Byrd, D-W.Va, and Bob Dole, R-Kan., had for him in
December, Nixon aide John Taylor said.
   In the two days before the vote, Taylor said, Nixon spoke with
five senators, all of whom he said voted against the veto override.

   Workers stayed home in the restive
province of Kosovo today after activists called a general strike to
protest alleged mistreatment of ethnic Albanians.
   The state news agency Tanjug said work stoppages occurred in 20
Kosovo companies, including at the Stari Trg mine near Titova
Mitrovica, 25 miles north of Pristina, and at Trepca mine near this
provincial capital.
   Tanjug did not say how many workers were on strike.
   ``Swift police actions'' prevented hundreds of ethnic Albanians
from staging protests in Titova Mitrovica, Podujevo and several
other Kosovo towns, Tanjug said.
   Strikes and demonstrations at the Stari Trg and Trepca mines in
January led to the arrest of Azem Vlasi, the region's former
Communist leader, on charges of ``anti-revolutionary activity.'' He
is being tried and could face a maximum penalty of death if
convicted.
   Demonstrators in Kosovo have been demanding an end to alleged
discrimination against the Albanian majority and free elections in
the province.
   Meanwhile, an independent Kosovo human rights group issued a
statement protesting what it termed ``brutal police action against
innocent citizens'' who peacefully demonstrated in Pristina on
Wednesday.
   The Committee for the Protection of Human Rights also demanded
the lifting of a state of emergency in Kosovo, free elections and
the release of hundreds of ethnic Albanian political prisoners.
   Up to 100 riot police guarded the local Communist Party
headquarters in Pristina today and 500 Pristina University students
gathered in front of their dormitories, under the watch of
additional security forces.
   ``We want our legal rights, like all other people in
Yugoslavia,'' a student, who refused to give his name, told
journalists. ``We want a change of leadership, the release of all
political prisoners and free elections.''
   Police on Wednesday used a water cannon to disperse 40,000
ethnic Albanians demonstrating in front of the party headquarters
against a state of emergency declared in the province.
   At least 28 people died in violence that occurred in the
province last year, after constitutional changes that limited the
region's autonomy and gave Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic,
near-total control over the region.
   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians, who make up about 90 percent of
Kosovo's 1.9 million population, were jailed in the police
crackdown that followed the unrest. A partial state of emergency,
which authorities assert is necessary to protect the Serbian
minority in Kosovo, remains in force in the region.
   The student praised the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo, a newly
formed political movement, saying it represented the interests of
all people in Kosovo, both the majority Albanians and minority
Serbs.
   Democratic Alliance leader Ibrahim Rugova claimed today that
more than 100,000 people had joined his movement in the past month.
   Rugova said the group, which has been criticized by authorities
as hostile and separatist, had applied for official registration
and expected a reply by next week.
   He said the alliance was cooperating with other movements
promoting human rights in the region, and he denied allegations by
Serbian leaders that the movements were linked to opposition
parties in Slovenia.
   ``Our demands were raised long before the Serbian-Slovenian
split,'' Rugova noted, referring to ongoing tensions between the
reformist province of Slovenia and Serbia, whose hard-line
Communist leaders want to slow the pace of democratic reforms
sought by the Slovenes.
   Slovenian Communists, backed by their Croatian counterparts,
Monday split from the federal Communist Party, citing
irreconcilable ideological differences, and leaving Serbian
Communists in effective control of the party.
   Vlasi, Kosovo's former Communist leader, was arrested after
conservative Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic charged that he had
incited the miners to violence in the January 1989 strikes.
   International human rights organizations and the media in
Yugoslavia's liberal northern republics of Slovenia and Croatia
have claimed that human rights violations were common in Kosovo,
and indicated that Serbian authorities were to blame.

   Mourners at a memorial service for a Black
Muslim killed in a clash with sheriff's deputies called for an
investigation into the man's death.
   ``We must say to Sheriff (Sherman) Block we demand justice in
this matter, state Assemblywoman Maxine Waters told the crowd of
about 400 at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church Thursday
night.
   NFL Hall of Famer Jim Brown, City Councilman Nate Holden and
homeless activist Ted Hayes also attended the service.
   Oliver Beasley, 27, was shot and killed early Tuesday by
sheriff's deputies in the second confrontation this month between
Black Muslims and authorities.
   In the incident, two deputies, one a trainee, pulled over
18-year-old David Hartley's car for a traffic violation near
suburban Compton. Some men emerged from a nearby apartment and
gathered around Hartley's car, sheriff's spokesmen said.
   The men, who like Hartley were Black Muslims, twice refused to
go back inside the building and the deputies claimed they were
jumped as they took Harley's arms to walk him back to their patrol
car, the spokesmen said.
   One man disarmed the trainee, identified in news reports as
Deputy David Dolson, 24. His partner, identified as Deputy William
Tackaberry, 39, fired one shot, which did not hit anyone, sheriff's
officials said.
   As the group retreated, one man still had Dolson's gun. The
deputy drew a backup weapon and fired, striking Hartley in the
shoulder and Beasley in the head, officials said.
   Khallid Muhammad, a special assistant to Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan, claimed sheriff's deputies began to beat Hartley
when he refused to lie face down on the ground.
   ``We have a prayer position in which we go down on our knees and
touch our forehead to the floor,'' he said. ``We don't bow down to
anyone except Allah.''
   Hartley, 18, pleaded innocent in Inglewood Municipal Court on
Thursday to charges of attempting to take a gun from a peace
officer, battery on a peace officer, and interfering with a peace
officer.
   Four men and a teen-age boy who had been held in the incident
were released because the deputies could not identify them,
authorities said.
   On Jan. 3, two dozen officers and 13 Nation of Islam members
clashed in southwest Los Angeles, with injuries on both sides. The
confrontations have increased interest in a scheduled speech by
Farrakhan on Feb. 2 at the Los Angeles Sports Arena.

   Twenty-one people accused of illegally collecting
and selling protected cactus plants worth thousands of dollars have
been indicted on federal charges as a result of a four-year
undercover investigation.
   ``We live in a very fragile environment in Arizona, and we
intend to do what we can to maintain that environment,'' U.S.
Attorney Steven McNamee said. ``We intend to prosecute vigorously
anyone involved in stealing cacti.''
   The indictments alleged thousands of cacti _ primarily barrel
cactus but also including towering saguaros, some hundreds of years
old _ have been uprooted and stolen since 1986 from federal, state
or private lands throughout Arizona.
   Healthy saguaros can sell for hundreds of dollars and prized
``crested'' plants sell for as much as $15,000. The saguaro cactus
is not listed as endangered but is protected under Arizona's native
plant law and under a federal law that prohibits the interstate
trafficking of protected plants. It's also Arizona's state plant.
   Nineteen of the 21 people charged in the Fish and Wildlife
Service investigation had been arrested as of early today. They
were named in indictments issued Wednesday by federal grand juries
in Phoenix and Tucson, officials said.
   Charges include theft of federal property, conspiracy and
illegal interstate transportation of protected plants. The charges
carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   ``This action demonstrates that the federal government takes
very seriously its responsibility to protect plants,'' Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan said in a statement issued in Washington.
   Lujan, who is from New Mexico, called the saguaro ``a cherished
part of our Western landscape'' and said ``those who collect them
illegally are stealing from the public for their own personal
profit.''
   ``People come from all over the world to see these giant saguaro
cactus. This is a big part of our tourist industry, like the Grand
Canyon,'' McNamee said.
   Investigators said the defendants allegedly removed saguaros
from remote areas during the night and sold them to nurseries,
development companies and collectors in Arizona, Kansas, Nevada,
California and such foreign countries as Canada and Japan.
   The investigation was characterized as the largest federal case
ever undertaken involving a protected plant.
   Fish and Wildlife agents, alerted to the cactus theft problem by
Arizona officials several years ago, set up a phony business in
suburban Scottsdale in 1986 and began posing as cactus dealers.
   ``We saw what we felt was a very flourishing business when we
first started,'' said Richard Marks, the Fish and Wildlife Service
agent who headed the investigation.
   The saguaros cactus is is protected by Arizona state law because
it is highly vulnerable to damage by vandals and because the plants
do not begin to reproduce until they are 50 to 75 years old.
   Officials said approximately 150 large saguaros, from 12 to 20
feet tall, and nine crested saguaros were sold to federal agents.
Marks said it wasn't yet known what will happen to them.
   Cactuses legally obtained from public lands have a tag and a
government seal.
   The Sonoran Desert in southern Arizona and Mexico is the only
place saguaros grow naturally, Marks said.

   The Avianca 707 that crashed in northern Long
Island in New York with more than 140 people aboard was nearly 23
years old, Boeing Co. officials said.
   Jack Gamble of Boeing Commercial Airplanes said the plane, the
592nd of its kind made for commercial use, originally was delivered
to Pan American World Airways on Jan. 30, 1967, and was transferred
to Avianca on Feb. 25, 1977.
   Gamble said today the plane had 61,193 flight hours and 22,764
landings, ``neither one of which is very high for an aircraft of
that age. What it indicates is that it has been used a lot for
long-haul flight.''
   Gamble did not know if the plane had recent problems. He said
the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board will
get that information from the plane's maintenance log.
   Boeing sent a safety investigator, a pilot and a fuel systems
expert to help the NTSB in its investigation, Gamble said.
   The flight, en route from Bogota, crashed in Cove Neck, N.Y.,
about 9:45 p.m. while on approach to Kennedy International Airport.
   Avianca has two 707s and two 720s, a 707 derivative, and may
lease others, he added.
   Of 878 Boeing 707s delivered between 1955 and 1978, 454 were
still in commercial use as of June, Gamble said.
   Another 122 models using the 707 airframe have been ordered for
military uses, including the E-3 airborne warning and control
systems; the E-6 Navy airborne communications plane and the C-135
military transport.
   The 707 was Boeing's first commercial jetliner. The first
version, rolled out in May 1954 as the prototype Dash 80, was
accepted in 1972 by the Smithsonian Institution as ``one of the 12
most significant aircraft of all time.''
   The first order was placed in October 1955 by Pan Am, and the
four-engine jet went into the airline's trans-Atlantic service on
Oct. 26, 1958.

   Tanks, artillery guns, military
regiments and children paraded in the capital Friday to celebrate
the 40th anniversary of India becoming a republic.
   President Ramaswamy Venkataraman took the salute at the parade,
which marched about 15 miles through the city from the Presidential
Palace to the 16th century Red Fort.
   Visitors to the ceremony were frisked and were directed through
metal detectors as authorities mounted stringent security measures
to guard against possible attacks by Moslem or Sikh militants
fighting for independence.
   Security men in plain clothes, mounted police and paramilitary
commandos surrounded the gallery where Venkataraman, Prime Minister
V.P. Singh and members of the Cabinet were seated.
   Massed bands, groups of tribal dancers and children doing
rhythmic exercises followed the military section.

   Parliament voted Friday to drop a volatile
proposal to nationalize Communist Party wealth, bowing to the
Solidarity-led government's argument that a commission should
review the property's status.
   The Sejm voted 246-29 to accept the withdrawal of a draft law
submitted by members who advocated radical moves to regain for the
national treasury buildings, companies, cars and other assets
amassed by the Communist Party in four decades of control.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who has warned against the
temptation to take revenge on the Communists, had asked that the
bill be withdrawn.
   Mazowiecki, the first non-Communist to lead a government in the
East bloc, had ended public subsidies to political parties and
banned the further sale or lease of state property to parties.
   But a potentially divisive public clamor grew when the
government did not move to regain the Communists' holdings.
Aleksander Hall, the Cabinet minister responsible for political
parties, said nationalizing the Communist Party assets would be
``reminiscent of the road chosen by Communists after World War II.''
   Addressing the lower house of parliament before the vote Friday,
Hall criticized the occupations, mostly by students, of local
Communist Party buildings in several cities nationwide.
   ``We will not build a democratic Poland, we will not build a
democratic state, if the law is not the law,'' he said.
   The occupiers, often young members of radical opposition groups,
have demanded that the property be given to universities or other
public use. In some cities, the party has agreed while in others
municipal commissions have been set up to decide the disputes.
   In a resolution adopted Friday, the Sejm approved of the
national commission established by Mazowiecki while requiring
monthly reports on the panel's progress.
   During the national commission's first meeting Thursday, the
Communist Party Central Committee agreed to submit a tally of party
property by Feb. 15.
   Nearly 100 Solidarity parliament members had sponsored the draft
law to reclaim Communist Party holdings, but most withdrew their
backing after a lengthy caucus Wednesday.
   Sejm Deputy Zygmunt Lupina said Friday the group agreed to drop
the proposal at Mazowiecki's request.
   The Communists had reacted vigorously to the nationalization
drive, calling it an ``attack'' that amounted to ``robbery.''
   Party First Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski said a total
takeover would deprive the reformed Communist Party of the means to
survive.
   The property issue came to the fore as the Communists prepared
to open their 11th national Congress Saturday. The Polish United
Workers Party, as the party is formally known, is expected to be
dissolved and reformed with a new name and program that leaders
hope will salvage a place for it in Poland's democratic future.
   Without subsidies from the government budget, the Communists are
counting on finding new ways to use their property to support the
party.

<TEXT>
   President Bush will propose increasing
spending for the Strategic Defense Initiative to about $4.8 billion
in fiscal 1991, despite Congress' success last year in slashing
funds for Star Wars, say congressional sources.
   The budget total for SDI is about $1 billion more than last year
when the Democratic-controlled Congress approved $3.8 billion for
the anti-missile shield, marking the first decrease in the program
since President Reagan introduced it six years ago.
   The fiscal 1991 budget total includes between $4.5 billion and
$4.6 billion for the Pentagon work on Star Wars, congressional
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Thursday.
Approximately $300 million more is earmarked for the Department of
Energy and military construction.
   Lawmakers already are eyeing the SDI total as a ``cash cow'' for
other programs, particularly as democracies emerge in Eastern
Europe, lessening the Soviet threat to the West, and the budget
deficit increases.
   President Bush will unveil his proposed budget Monday, spelling
out the details in his State of the Union speech Wednesday.
   Congressional sources said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney would
push for full-scale development of SDI that favors the ``brilliant
pebbles'' plan, a system composed of many small ground- and
space-based interceptors that would sense enemy ballistic missiles.
The interceptors would ram the missiles, causing them to explode.
   A number of Democrats on Capitol Hill have instead supported
long-term research on directed energy weapons.
   Cheney also is proposing a sweeping list of military base
closures and reductions at home and overseas, just one year after
Congress agreed to 86 base closings and five realignments, said
Pentagon and congressional sources.
   Among the bases targeted are:
   _The Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, a shipbuilding and repair
center that has 9,000 military and 20,000 civilian workers.
   _In California, the San Francisco's Treasure Island Naval
Station, the Alameda Naval Air Station, the Oakland Naval Supply
Center and the Oakland Naval Hospital, as well as the Long Beach
Naval Shipyard.
   _The Army's Fort Monroe, a training center in Hampton, Va.,
reportedly was on the list. However, a spokesman for Sen. John
Warner, R-Va., said today that the senator has been assured the
site will not be closed.
   ``There are no significant base closures in Virginia, although
there are several minor realignments,'' said spokesman Phil Smith.
He said he had no information about the exact nature of those
changes.
   _The Army's 2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood, Texas, would be
disbanded under the plan. About 10,000 soldiers, one-fourth of Fort
Hood's troop population, are connected with the armored division at
the base, the largest military installation in the free world.
   Part of the division is stationed in Europe and Pentagon
officials stressed that any reduction in forces there would be
along the lines of superpower arms control reduction pacts.
   _Fort McClellan, Ala., would be closed in 1993 and its military
police and chemical weapons schools relocated to other bases,
according to members of the Alabama congressional delegation.
   _Fort Ord, Calif., would be closed, and the 7th Infantry
Division stationed there would be transferred to Fort Lewis, Wash.
   _The 9th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis is slated to be sharply
cut back.
   _Besides the reductions in Europe, several military
installations in the Pacific are also on tap for closure, the
sources said.
   Cheney is slated to formally unveil the list on Monday, but
officials have already begun notifying congressional delegations of
the proposed shutdowns and changes, congressional sources said.
   Sources warned that last-minute changes could be made, given the
volatile political nature of the suggested cuts.
   Among the other budget proposals expected in Bush's fiscal 1991
plan is production of five B-2 stealth bombers. Last year, Congress
approved funds for components for five of the radar-evading
aircraft in fiscal 1991.
   The administration, however, will scale back the program, which
initially had the Air Force acquiring 132 bombers at a cost of $70
billion, sources said.
   Over a three-year peak period for the bomber, the Pentagon
proposed spending about $24 billion _ $7.8 billion in fiscal 1992,
$8.4 billion in fiscal 1993 and $7.7 billion in fiscal 1994.
Members of Congress told Pentagon officials last year that the
likelihood of one program receiving that amount of money in a
single year was slim.
   A rancorous fight is expected on Capitol Hill over spending for
the bat-winged plane.
   Sources said they expect Bush to continue spending for two
land-based nuclear missiles _ the multiple-warhead, rail-garrison
MX and the single-warhead Midgetman.
   Among the other budget proposals are cancellation of the M-1
tank after this year, the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor
aircraft and the Apache helicopter.
   The proposal also calls for mothballing the battleships USS Iowa
and the USS New Jersey.

<HEAD>With PM-East Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Hans Modrow of East Germany said
today that his country wants to establish diplomatic relations with
Israel and is prepared to discuss reparations for Nazi victims.
   East Germany has never had full diplomatic relations with Israel
because it refused to accept any responsibility for the Holocaust.
But Modrow told a news conference after meeting with Austrian
leaders that East Germany had proposed negotiations on establishing
ties.
   ``There will probably be negotiations and the problem of
reparation will be aired,'' he told reporters asking about ties
with Israel, now being revived throughout East Europe as more
liberal governments take over from orthdox Communist regimes.
   Unlike West Germany, East Germany has refused to pay reparations
for Nazi atrocities and confiscations, claiming that its people
constituted the anti-Nazi resistance during the war and bore no
responsibility for Hitler's actions.
   Other Eastern Europe nations that had ties with Israel broke
them off after the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. Romania was the only
nation with ties that refused to sever relations.
   Modrow spoke of the possibility of resuming ties with Israel
hours before paying a formal call on Austrian President Kurt
Waldheim, who is criticized by Israelis and Jews worldwide for
concealing his past as a soldier in the German army in the Balkans
in World War II.
   A panel of historians appointed by the Austrian government
issued a February 1988 report that presented no evidence to clearly
back allegations Waldheim committed atrocities. But it said he was
``in close proximity'' to some Nazi atrocities, knew they were
going on and made no attempt to prevent them.
   Modrow, a respected Communist reformer chosen to lead a
provisional government after massive protests ousted the hard-line
regime last year, faces serious problems at home.
   A worsening economy, the continued exodus of his citizens to the
West and growing dissent among opposition groups have threatened
the fragile stability of the country.
   Asked about his problems at home, Modrow refused to specify that
he would quit the ruling Communist Party, as some opposition groups
have demanded.
   The Communists have promised to hold free elections on May 6.
   Modrow said he was prepared to discuss his position with the
party once he has succeeded in building a coalition government that
includes the opposition.
   Modrow also criticized the revamped Communist Party for being
too slow in moving away from its Stalinist past and the abuses of
Erich Honecker's corrupt rule.
   Modrow, who will visit Moscow on Tuesday for talks with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, faced a new crisis of confidence at
home today following the announcement by one of the four small
parties governing with the dominant Communists that it will pull
its three ministers out of the 27-member Cabinet.
   The small Christian Democratic Union said it made the move to
indicate to the opposition and other parties that the three
ministerial posts it held were free for distribution to any other
group.
   Modrow said he shared that view and stressed that he was making
a ``fair offer'' of a coalition to East Germany's emerging
opposition groups, who are divided over whether to join any
Modrow-led cabinet.
   The East German premier held talks today with Austrian
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, with the two agreeing to a three-month
experiment in lifting visa requirements for citizens of each
country.

<HEAD>Two U.S. Bases to be Closed In Greece</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP DOPOULOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States will close two of its
four major military installations in Greece, political party
leaders said today.
   The disclosure came after leaders of the three parties that
support the coalition government met with Premier Xenophon Zolotas.
   Constantine Mitsotakis, leader of the conservative New Democracy
grouping, confirmed a report by Athens newspaper Ethnos that U.S.
envoy to Athens Michael Sotirhos advised the Greeks on Thursday of
the U.S. decision to shut the bases.
   Panhellenic Socialist Movement leader Andreas Papandreou told
reporters that Zolotas had discussed the U.S. advisory at their
meeting.
   Communist Party chief Harilaos Florakis told reporters that if
the bases were closed it would be a ``significant development.''
   The Ethnos report said that Sotirhos passed on a letter from
U.S. Defense Secretary Richard Cheney to his Greek counterpart
Tzannis Tzannetakis.
   The letter said that Hellinikon Air Base, which is adjacent to
Athens International Airport, and the U.S. Navy communications
station at Nea Makri, 20 miles southeast of the capital, would be
removed.
   The closure of the bases is considered part of the U.S.
Pentagon's plan to shut down dozens of military installations in
the United States and abroad. Cheney is to present the Pentagon's
defense budget proposal on Monday in Washington.
   This would leave two other major military installations in
Greece _ a U.S. Air Force communications monitoring post and a
refueling base for the Navy's 6th Fleet. Both are located on the
island of Crete.
   The Hellenikon Air Base, which is used by reconnaisance aircraft
to shadow Soviet fleet movements in the Mediterranean, is also a
support unit for U.S. bases in Turkey.
   The Nea Makri station monitors telephone traffic in the
Mediterranean.
   In addition to the four major installations, there are 20 small
U.S. radar and communications stations spread throughout the
country.
   The bases were established in Greece through a Defense and
Cooperation Agreement initialed in the mid-1950s which also granted
Greece $350 million annually through military assistance programs.
   A five-year agreement covering the bases expired in December
1988. It gave the U.S. 17 months to dismantle the bases if no new
accord were reached.
   Parliament is to debate a conservative-socialist proposal next
month calling for a six-month extension on the May 21 deadline to
remove property, personnel and materiel in order to give Greek-U.S.
negotiators more time.
   After 17 rounds of fruitless negotiations both parties suspended
talks before national elections last June. A short-lived
conservative-Communist coalition put the bases issue on hold.
   Officials in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the decision to close Hellenikon and Nea Makri is unrelated to
the talks on renewing the lease for U.S. bases in Greece.
   The Greeks had demanded that any new defense accord include a
guarantee of assistance in case of aggression by NATO ally Turkey,
which the U.S. has been reluctant in providing.

<TEXT>
   A man who served 13 years in prison on
a 1970 air hijacking conviction and helped challenge the city
government as racially discriminatory says he plans to run for a
seat on the new City Council.
   Lorenzo Ervin Jr. said Thursday he is trying to get his full
citizenship restored so he can qualify as a candidate in the May 1
election to replace the current City Commission.
   In Tennessee, people convicted of felonies and sentenced to
prison are barred from public office unless a state circuit court
has granted full rights of citizenship, said Hamilton County
election registrar Steve Conrad.
   Ervin was one of 10 people who filed a federal lawsuit in 1987
successfully challenging the City Commission system as
discriminatory to black voters.
   U.S. District Judge R. Allan Edgar ruled in August that blacks
did not have a fair chance to be elected under the at-large system,
and last week he approved a new government consisting of a mayor
and a nine-district council.
   Ervin announced his plans to run for a council seat in a letter
to Gerald W. Jones of the Civil Rights Division of U.S. Department
of Justice.
   Citing what he called a history of unfair elections in
Chattanooga, Ervin asked the Justice Department to assign federal
election monitors to the May 1 election.
   In a deposition filed with the voting rights lawsuit, Ervin
testified he was convicted of two counts of air piracy and
kidnapping in 1970 for boarding an Eastern Airlines jet in Atlanta
and forcing the crew at gunpoint to fly to Cuba.
   Cuban authorities arrested him and sent him to Czechoslovakia,
and eventually he was brought back to the United States, where he
was convicted and sentenced to two life terms in prison.
   Ten years were added to that sentence for his participation in a
prison riot, Ervin said, but he was paroled in 1983.

   Police set up roadblocks and
arrested 31 black youths today to prevent protests at a stadium
where an English cricket team defying a ban on sports contacts with
South Africa played a match.
   Witnesses said activists ran through the mining city of
Kimberley breaking car and shop windows after police barred them
from demonstrating at the stadium.
   Hundreds of demonstrators attempted to protest outside the De
Beers Club stadium where the match was being played, but police set
up a roadblock about a half-mile from the stadium, witnesses said.
   Two busloads of protesters coming from the Johannesburg area
were turned back by police.
   Protest leaders in Kimberley met with Ali Bacher, managing
director of the South African Cricket Union, and demanded they be
allowed to march on the stadium.
   Bacher, who organized the English tour, agreed to the demand.
   However, police still refused to allow the protesters near the
stadium, where the English squad began a three-day match against
players from two Cape Province teams.
   After the negotiations failed, witnesses said some protesters
began running toward town carrying sticks and stones, and breaking
windows along the way.
   Police dispersed the crowd at the roadblock and chased the
demonstrators, witnesses said.
   Officers said 31 youths were arrested and that a 52-year-old man
was injured by the protesters.
   Bacher, who has been seeking to minimize conflict related to the
tour, later went to a local magistrate and obtained approval for a
protest to be held outside the stadium Saturday.
   The English team is defying a ban on sports contacts with South
Africa that was imposed to protest the country's policy of racial
segregation.
   All the English players face expulsion from international
cricket for five years for taking part in the tour.
   Activists have said they will stage protests throughout the
six-week visit by the English team. There have been protests
outside the hotels where the players have been staying in
Johannesburg and Kimberley.
   Black hotel workers have refused to serve the British players
and have demanded that other hotel guests produce identification
showing they are not part of the team.
   The English players have not said how much they are being paid
for the tour, but local newspapers have put the figure at $160,000
each.

<HEAD>Burn Victim Advocate Seeks to Publish Letters by Man Who Burned
Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORANGE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Letters and an autobiography written by the
man who set his 6-year-old son afire can provide insight into the
minds of people who do such things, says a burn victims' advocate
who wants to publish the writings.
   ``It's important to bring to the public's attention the problems
that we're faced with here with child abuse, child abuse by
burning,'' said Harry J. Gaynor, president of the National Burn
Victim Foundation.
   Charles Rothenberg was paroled from a 13-year prison term in
California on Wednesday.
   ``A world without fears has always been my dream. Son, I love
you,'' Rothenberg wrote months after setting fire to his son.
   Gaynor said Thursday the book would consist of excerpts from 157
letters Rothenberg sent him, an autobiography Rothenberg wrote in
prison and sections by a psychologist, pastor and Gaynor. All three
interviewed Rothenberg for 10 hours in prison, Gaynor said.
   Rothenberg contacted the foundation in 1985 after seeing it
mentioned on a television talk show and began his correspondence
with Gaynor. Gaynor said a New York publisher he would not identify
has expressed interest in the book.
   All proceeds from the book would go to the foundation's work,
Gaynor said.
   The non-profit group, with a staff of six and $300,000 budget,
coordinates transportation for burn victims and physicians,
counsels victims, provides referrals, and trains health and social
service professionals to detect child abuse by burning.
   Gaynor, a former electronics company executive, said he wants to
publish the book to provide insight into what prompts adults to
abuse children.
   ``If Charles had this book, or was knowledgeable about the
problems he was having, perhaps, hopefully, he would have reached
out for help,'' said Gaynor.
   ``God forbid'' the foundation should be considered an apologist
for Rothenberg, Gaynor said.
   ``He is not the hero. It is David. We are not promoting Charles
Rothenberg, we are telling his story and analyzing his story.''
   Gaynor said the manuscript shows that Rothenberg wanted to hurt
his wife, now Marie Hafdahl, more than his son. He said she has not
answered his letters.
   ``I was ready, in some way, to commit suicide with David, to end
it all, to get away from Marie's mouth and the years of verbal
abuse that I could never understand,'' Rothenberg wrote.
   In letters Gaynor released Thursday, Rothenberg expresses
remorse for his ``unforgivable act'' and said his ``mission is to
help other parents' children who're abused and neglected.''
   David, now 13 and still badly disfigured, said at a news
conference Wednesday he wished his father could be jailed for life,
and would never forgive him.
   California officials have kept Rothenberg's parole location a
secret and have said he will be closely watched.

<HEAD>Sheriff Encourages Residents to Buy Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANDERSON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sheriff is encouraging residents to buy
illegal drugs _ and promising them up to 25 percent of any money or
assets seized from dealers they help arrest.
   ``I want people to realize they can make some really good money,
depending on how much they cooperate,'' said Anderson County
Sheriff Gene Taylor Taylor, who is putting some of his own money
into a campaign to spread word about the program.
   Billboards scheduled to go up Feb. 2 will feature the slogan
``Need cash? Turn in a dope dealer.''
   Participants may either work as buyers who testify in court or
as confidential informants, although those who testify probably
will be paid more, Taylor said.
   Security will be provided during drug transactions and
informants won't face criminal charges for assisting in
investigations.
   ``They'll be watched closely,'' he said. ``An officer would be
within seconds of them.''
   Taylor said his six narcotics agents are swamped and he needs
more help with drug cases.
   The sheriff's program is modeled after one used by federal
authorities that grant informants up to 25 percent of money or
assets seized.
   The billboard program is a joint venture between the sheriff's
office and Summey Outdoor Advertising Inc.. The company is donating
space on 15 billboards and Taylor will spend $800 to $1,000 of his
own money for the signs that go on the billboards.
   The sheriff said participants will be screened job and won't be
paid until after the case has been cleared in court.
   ``I realize this program won't appeal to the majority of people
in Anderson County,'' he said. ``This is for the person who really
wants to get involved.''
   The sheriff said he and Tim Ragen of the billboard company came
up with the publicity idea after meeting Thursday.
   Ragen, who has been in Anderson several months, said he
approached the sheriff about such a program after working with one
on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. ``It was very successful,'' he said.

   Who says Chinese police don't like a good time?
   The eve of Lunar New Year, China's biggest festival, is the only
day of the year that police are allowed to drink on the job.
   Those who patrol the streets around the Beijing Train Station
joined the rest of the population Friday in saluting the Year of
the Horse _ and commiserating on their hard lot.
   ``People say we have no feelings. That's an insult,'' said Zhao
Guangheng, chief of the Train Station Police District.
   ``The requirements of our job are that we not show emotion, and
we are always busy so we don't have much time with people. We are
like thermoses _ the outside is cold and hard but inside is warm.''
   Zhao, after giving a rare interview on crimefighting in one of
Beijing's most heavily policed districts, invited foreign
journalists to the station's Lunar New Year lunch and began passing
around the ``white liquor'' _ 120-proof firewater.
   ``Ordinarily police can't drink on the job,'' he said after
running from table to table to lift toasts. ``Even at home one can
only drink a little _ it wouldn't do to get drunk.''
   Most of the district's more than 200 police will be on duty
throughout the four-day holiday weekend, Zhao said, including 40
who are undercover police.
   ``A policeman's life is a hard one, all over the world,'' he
said with a sigh. ``We can't spend too much time with our families
_ what if a crime was committed while you were resting at home?''
   That's why the district decided to get its police together for a
holiday lunch, he said, ``so everyone could display their warm
feelings'' for a change during the lull between holiday crowds.
   Zhao said nearly 200,000 travelers passed through the station
each of the days leading up to Friday, en route to family reunions.
That's about double the normal passenger traffic.
   On Friday, by contrast, the station was so empty that uniformed
and plainclothes police outnumbered travelers in the large lobby.
The next rush will come on Monday and Tuesday, as holiday makers
return home.
   Keeping illegal travelers out of Beijing is one of the main
duties of Zhao's men, and patrols on Friday stopped passersby from
time to time to check their identification. Chinese are required by
law to carry a national ID card that shows where they are
registered to live, and peasants seeking work in the city are
quickly sent back home.
   Train station security was especially tight after June, when the
government crushed massive pro-democracy protests in Beijing and
other cities. But Zhang Shuquan, propaganda chief for the train
district police station, said police have relaxed their checks of
passengers more recently.
   A luggage X-ray machine that had been set up in the train
station's entrance appeared to have been dismantled.
   Zhao's three-block district, which does not include inside the
station, arrests an average of 500 people each year, he said.
   The crime rate dropped last year, and just four crimes have
occurred so far this year, all thefts. One reason might be the
citywide increase since June in patrols by plainclothes police.
   As the party progressed, a man in ordinary blue workman's
clothes came in and sat down. ``Here is the head of our secret
police,'' Zhao said.
   The man nodded and smiled. ``I've seen you around,'' he told the
reporters.

   A federal magistrate entered
innocent pleas today for four suspected members of the Irish
Republican Army accused of buying an anti-aircraft missile for a
terrorist campaign in Northern Ireland.
   The four men refused to enter pleas and stood mute, prompting
U.S. Magistrate Ann Vitunac to enter pleas in their behalf. A
pretrial conference was scheduled for Feb. 28 in Fort Lauderdale.
   Kevin McKinley, 33, of Riviera Beach; Seamus Moley, 30, of
Canada; Joseph McColgan, 39, of Dundalk, Ireland; and Sean McCann,
34, of Toronto, were arrested Jan. 12 by federal agents after the
Stinger surface-to-air missile changed hands in an undercover sting.
   Prosecutors charge the defendants intended to use the missile
against British military helicopters in Northern Ireland.
   Michael Dowd, a New York lawyer representing McKinley, was a
co-counsel in a 1981 New York trial in which five suspected IRA
terrorists were acquitted. He said attorneys for the four men are
working for free.
   ``It's all about freedom,'' Dowd said. ``If you can't give your
time for that, what can you give it for? This is very satisfying.
It's better than money.''
   The four defendants allegedly dealt with an undercover agent to
buy the shoulder-fired missile for the militant Provisional IRA, a
government affidavit said.
   They are charged with violating the Neutrality Act and the Arms
Export Control Act. Each faces up to 38 years in prison if
convicted.

   A man has been charged with trying to
pickle his neighbor's porkers.
   Charles Myers, 19, of Canton, was in the Madison County Jail on
Friday after giving whiskey and wine to a neighbor's hogs Saturday,
said sheriff's investigator Carroll Phelps.
   Myers was arrested Sunday after Mattie Mae Randall accused him
of giving the hogs the alcohol despite her pleas to stop, Phelps
said. He threw whiskey on Randall and left only when she threatened
to get her gun, she told authorities.
   Randall said Thursday her hogs apparently were unharmed and
didn't appear drunk. ``I really don't know if it took effect on
them or not,'' she said.
   Myers has been held in the jail since Sunday because of
outstanding warrants on unrelated charges, authorities said. In the
pig incident he was charged with trespassing, malicious mischief
and three counts of simple assault, all misdemeanors.

   A thief stole a fire rescue truck from the
scene of a fire, then apparently used the emergency radio to elude
capture, authorities said.
   The vehicle was found, with a minor dent in the passenger door,
in a parking lot more than four hours later, said Fire Department
Capt. David Tolliver.
   No arrests have been made. ``Whoever had the truck listened to
every move,'' Tolliver said.
   The truck was stolen Wednesday when two firefighters left it
while investigating a small fire in a downtown apartment building.
The truck, worth $10,000, contained $20,000 to $25,000 in
equipment, Tolliver said.
   ``Who would have thought with two firemen and police in the
building that someone would steal the vehicle?'' asked Tolliver.
   Firefighters are trained to leave the keys in the ignitions at
fire scenes because they often need to move them in a hurry, he
said.

   Orders to U.S. factories for durable goods
rose for the second consecutive month in December, the government
said Friday in a report analysts said indicates the sluggish
manufacturing economy is stabilizing.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods _
big-ticket items expected to last more than three years _ increased
2.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted $133.5 billion in December
after gaining 4.9 percent in November.
   But the manufacturing sluggishness through much of 1989 was
reflected in the report's figures for the entire year: While orders
were up 5.9 percent to $1.52 trillion, they advanced at their
slowest pace since a 0.4 percent gain in 1986. Orders increased
10.9 percent in 1988.
   ``The durable goods report says there is a weak economy but
hints at a slight firming in the industrial sector,'' said Allen
Sinai, chief economist for The Boston Co.
   ``It (manufacturing) seems to be regaining its equilibrium,''
agreed Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for The Northern Trust
Co. in Chicago. ``It doesn't seem to be spiraling down into a
recession.''
   Sinai also noted the volatility of the durable goods reports and
said the two-month increase does not necessarily establish a trend.
The pace of orders in 1989 ranged from November's 4.9 percent
increase to a 4.5 percent decrease last May and often was affected
by major one-time transportation and defense orders.
   Both Dederick and Sinai said the industrial economy remains weak
and pointed out that if the transportation sector were excluded
from the December report, total orders would have been unchanged
from November.
   Indeed, the Commerce Department said the increase in orders last
month was concentrated in the transportation sector, up 8.7 percent
to $39.9 billion after a 10.6 percent gain in November.
   But this growth was in aircraft, shipbuilding and tanks, it
explained, which more than offset a decline in motor vehicles.
   The automobile industry has been in a slump since sales
incentives were removed when 1990-model cars were introduced in
October, resulting in excessive inventories and widespread plant
shutdowns.
   New orders for non-defense capital goods, often a barometer of
business investment plants, jumped 18.6 percent to $46 billion
after gaining 7.9 percent in November.
   The Commerce Department said the December increase was
concentrated in the aircraft industry while the previous month's
was shared by all of the categories.
   Orders for electrical machinery rose 1.6 percent to $22.1
billion after a 7.9 percent increase in November.
   But orders for non-electrical machinery, including computers and
a wide variety of industrial equipment, slipped 4.3 percent to
$21.7 billion after a 5.8 percent increase in November.
   Primary metals orders also were off, down 2.9 percent to $10.9
billion after a 2.2 percent gain the previous month.
   New orders for defense capital goods declined 29.2 percent to
$8.1 billion after gaining 18.9 percent in November. Excluding
defense, orders would have risen 5.5 percent.
   Shipments of durable goods in December slipped 0.2 percent to
$122.9 billion after rising 1.1 percent in November.

   Soviet Azerbaijan is ``a great market''
for Islam and Iran must exploit it before Western values can gain a
foothold, an Iranian leader said Friday.
   Ayatollah Abdulkarim Musavi Ardebili, a former chief justice,
said in a Friday prayer sermon it was urgent that Iran exert its
influence with the predominantly Shiite Moslem population of the
neighboring Soviet republic, Tehran radio reported.
   Strikes continued to paralyze transport in Baku, capital of
Azerbaijan, on Friday but Soviet news media said many shops opened
for the first time since the Red Army entered the city a week ago.
   More than 170 people have been killed since ethnic violence
began Jan. 13 between Azerbaijanis and ethnic Armenians, most of
whom are Christians.
   ``There is now a great market for the introduction of Islam,''
Ardebili said. ``Moslems are dutybound; I would like to say the
issue is urgent. If we show complacency, the West will fill the
vacuum: Western democracy, American morals, or even American
economics.''
   Ardebili said Soviet Azerbaijanis were ``thirsty for Islam.
Therefore, it is a religious duty for us to respond to their
requests through proper channels, before we even think of our own
food, clothing, livelihood or medicine. Otherwise we will have to
account to God.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Ardebili also
read a message addressed to Azerbaijani Moslems, in their own
Turkic language, expressing condolences for the deaths of their
loved ones.
   It quoted Ahmad Jannati, head of the Islamic Propagation
Organization, as saying Soviet Moslems urgently needed religious
books and a collection of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
sayings was being translated. Jannati's agency is in charge of
exporting Khomeini's fundamentalist revolution.
   At the Tehran prayer meeting, Ardebili said the upheavals in
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union were a ``miracle of history''
and described Communist governments as ``anti-God and
anti-prophets.''
   ``At present, communism has reached such a point that even
seasoned and experienced Communists are ashamed to speak about
it,'' he said, according to an IRNA dispatch.
   Ardebili, chief justice until August, is a member of the council
appointed by Khomeini in 1988 to resolve differences between
Parliament and the Council of Guardians, which reviews legislation.
He also is on the five-man Supreme Judicial Council.
   The news agency said dozens of Azerbaijani Moslems crossed into
Iran in the previous 24 hours despite frontier ``security
measures,'' and hundreds who had been in Iran returned home.

   A judge has ordered Washington Redskins owner
Jack Kent Cooke to pay his ex-wife $29,000 a year to support the
couple's 2-year-old daughter, far less than the $110,000 she had
requested. a hotel and told they
would be arrested, or even shot, if they stepped outside.
   In Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, Premier Sikander Hyat Khan of
Pakistani Kashmir said he would launch a Moslem ``holy war'' unless
the United Nations schedules a special session to address the
Kashmir issue.
   Muzaffarabad is the capital of Pakistani Kashmir and near the
cease-fire that has divided the region between India and Pakistan
since 1947, when the subcontinent became independent of Britain and
the two nations were created. India and Pakistan have fought four
wars, three of them specifically over Kashmir.
   Most of the 5 million people in the Indian State of
Jammu-Kashmir are Moslems. It is the only state with a Moslem
majority in India, a predominantly Hindu nation.
   ``If the United Nations is not ready to play its role ... I will
tell them to go and fight,'' Khan warned of the people in Pakistani
Kashmir.
   He gave the world organization until Feb. 17 to schedule a
special session. He said the deadline coincided with a scheduled
meeting all Pakistani political and religious parties in Islamabad.
   Tariq Mahmood Butt, head of the student wing of the militant
Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, said thousands of its members would
cross the frontier Feb. 11 if the United Nations did not promise
action.
   Indian state television described the situation in Jammu-Kashmir
as ``by and large peaceful,'' but said at least nine people were
killed Thursday when paramilitary troops fired on rioters in
Handwara, 40 miles northwest of Srinagar.
   Troops in Srinagar tightened restrictions under the 24-hour
curfew and prevented residents from opening windows, said witnesses
reached by telephone.
   From various vantage points in Srinagar, a city of 1 million,
only heavily armed troopers and an occasional government official
could be seen on the streets. Several people reached by telephone
from inside and outside Srinagar said they had not heard gunfire.
   Police sources in Jammu, winter capital of the state, said
militants hurled a gasoline bomb at soldiers during house searches
but no one was injured.
   The increased security coincided with the Moslem sabbath and
Republic Day, which major towns and cities in India usually
celebrate with military parades.
   Moslem separatists in Jammu-Kashmir, who want the state to be
either independent or joined to Pakistan, declared the national
holiday a ``black day.''
   Television showed Jameel Qureshi, adviser to the Jammu-Kashmir
state governor, taking the salute at a parade in Srinagar's Bakshi
Stadium. No civilian spectators were shown and a policeman who was
there said none attended.
   District magistrate Ghulam Abbas told about 20 journalists at
the Hotel Broadway: ``If you go out of the hotel, you can be shot,
and if we find out you have gone out, you can be imprisoned for six
months.''
   Soldiers with submachine guns were posted around the hotel,
which is about a mile from downtown Srinagar. The door leading to
the roof of the five-story building was locked and telephone
service was halted after the warning by Abbas.
   Seven journalists returned to New Delhi on a commercial flight
Friday afternoon. They said police took them to the Srinagar
airport by a circuitous route one officer said was designed to
skirt trouble. Police at the airport confiscated dozens of rolls of
film, they said.
   The Moslem separatist campaign is as old as the two nations, but
has escalated in recent weeks.
   Srinagar and surrounding towns were put under 24-hour curfew
Saturday and soldiers and paramilitary troopers were deployed.
Their number has not been released, but is known to be at least in
the hundreds.

<BYLINE>Romanian Vice President Quits; Cites `Stalinist Methods'

activities in Ceausescu government and revolution; ADDS comments

   Vice President Dumitru Mazilu resigned
today and cited ``Stalinist methods'' he said are being used by the
governing National Salvation Front.
   ``Taking into account, with profound sorrow and deep distress,
that the Stalinist methods and practices are maintained ... I
resign from my position, which, as you may remember, I stated from
the first day that I did not want,'' Mazilu said.
   Mazilu, who once was a colonel in Nicolae Ceausescu's dreaded
secret police force, fell from favor in the government after
writing a report for a U.N. commission that described
``nightmarish'' conditions in Romania.
   He became one of Ceausescu's most outspoken critics during the
December revolution that led to the dictator's ouster.
   ``I am convinced that those who have carried out the revolution
will never accept that it be taken over by people who haven't given
anything of themselves to it,'' Mazilu said.
   ``Wholeheartedly I remain on the people's side. I shall forever
remain devoted to democracy, freedom and ideals of dignity, which
have inspired the youth of the country in its fight against
tyranny,'' he said.
   ``I shall never forget their sacrifices.''
   Critics have demanded that the entire National Salvation Front
step down, in large part because of its decision to compete in
national elections in May.
   Opponents say the Front cannot fairly take part in an election
that it also administers, and some fear the Front wants a return to
one-party rule in Romania.
   The Front has been governing Romania by decree since Ceausescu
was overthrown Dec. 22.
   On Thursday night, the Front president, Ion lliescu, went on
national television to defend the governing body against growing
criticism.
   He denied it did anything wrong in deciding to compete in the
elections May 20 and added: ``It would have been absurd ... for the
Front, as the engine of national stabilization and recovery, not to
participate in the elections.''
   In an indication of the power struggle Romania faces in coming
months, Iliescu accused three revived political parties of
irresponsibility for demanding the Front stop governing if it
enters the elections.
   Iliescu also countered complaints about Communist holdovers in
the new leadership by charging that unidentified figures in some
emerging political parties and some ``biting'' journalists had also
been Communists.
   Virtually every professional in Romania had to be a party member
to hold any rank in Ceausescu's time, thus many journalists and
government figures who are prominent now were once Communists.
   ``For all its weakness and shortcomings, the National Salvation
Front is the only structure, very frail still, that bears the
brunt,'' Iliescu said. ``The collapse of this structure means
pushing the country into chaos.''
   Senior Communists who fell from Ceausescu's favor to become
prominent in the Front include Iliescu, Mazilu and foreign affairs
expert Silviu Brucan.
   The Front also includes non-Communists.
   Hundreds of people demonstrated against the Front outside its
headquarters in Bucharest on Wednesday and Thursday before being
dispersed by soldiers and police. No injuries were reported, but
the Front responded by restating its Jan. 3 decree outlawing street
protests unless authorized by police.
   On Jan. 12, an angry mob chanted ``Death to the Communists!''
outside the Front headquarters, prompting Iliescu to outlaw the
Communist Party. But he retracted that decision.
   During the Jan. 12 protest, Mazilu joined in the anti-Communist
chants and came under fire from some Front members because of it.
   Mazilu got in trouble with the Ceausescu regime when he was
asked by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in 1986 to
write a report on human rights and youth.
   He was never allowed back to Switzerland from Romania. His
report, which almost exclusively focused on what he termed
``nightmarish'' conditions in Romania, was smuggled out and made
public in Geneva last August.
   When his past as a secret police colonel was disclosed in a
newspaper report after the revolution, Mazilu ignored calls for his
resignation and was defended by other Front leaders.
   In another development today, Manea Manescu, a former Ceausescu
associate facing trial, said in an interview that he was only a
``simple executioner of orders'' and regretted he had not tried to
prevent the thousands of deaths in last month's revolution.
   Manescu was a member of the ruling Politburo under Ceausescu.
   He said the dictator would never have surrendered power
peacefully and added that ``the revolution by the Romanian people,
led by generous and courageous youth, was the only alternative to
the tyranny of the two,'' in reference to the dictator and his
wife, Elena.
   The two were executed by firing squad Dec. 25 after a military
tribunal convicted them of genocide and ruining the nation's
economy.
   Manescu's trial is scheduled to begin Saturday.

   Common scents has convinced several students at
Post Oak School in Houston that they need to recycle.
   Six students have been carrying around trash bags filled with
their own garbage for a week as part of a science project designed
to illustrate the growing solid waste crisis.
   Some were surprised at the load of trash they have accumulated.
   Seventh-grader Carlin Brady, 13, said Thursday that her
cumbersome load ``is filled with everything not good for you or the
environment. I'm surprised at how much trash one person can collect
in one weekend.''
   Students at the private school began the experiment last
Saturday to kick off a symposium this weekend at the suburban
Bellaire Civic Center called ``So You Want to Recycle?''
   Miss Brady said she doesn't mind explaining why she's carrying
the bag because ``it reminds people to recycle.'' But she admits
that she didn't socialize much over the weekend.
   For those who did want to go out somewhere where a reeking bag
of trash would be socially unacceptable, one could carry a small
environmentally acceptable brown bag.
   When asked who had the stinkiest bag, the students quickly
replied, ``Anthony!''
   ``Yes, I will be glad to get rid of it,'' Anthony Tunis, 12,
said shyly.
   ``There's a lot of stuff that can be recycled for money,'' he
said. ``And we need to, so we can save the planet.''

   A mock claim that French engineer
Alexandre Gustave Eiffel stole the idea for his Paris tower from a
structure in San Jose has been rejected by a judge.
   The just-for-fun legal debate City of San Jose vs. Paris
probably failed to appease civic boosters in San Jose.
   In his decision Thursday, Justice Marcel Poche refused to rule
if Eiffel, who was denounced as a crook, plagiarized the design of
San Jose's 208-foot high electric light tower, which was passed off
as resembling a clown's hat.
   Poche diplomatically ruled at the Court of Historical Inquiry
that the case ``boils down to a situation where two creative
individuals thousands of miles apart had similar ideas'' at about
the same time.
   At issue was whether the 984-foot tall Eiffel Tower, erected for
the International Exhibitin of 1889, imitated San Jose's ``Beacon
of the West,'' built eight years before the symbol of Paris.
   San Jose's representative, Dean Gerald F. Uelmen of the Santa
Clara University School of Law, alleged that the Eiffel Tower is a
``flimsy imitation'' of the San Jose tower built by J.J. Owen in
1881.
   Paris' representative, local attorney Jacques Dulin, retorted
that he was shocked at the ``gall'' of San Jose and mocked its
tower's ``poor clown's hat of a design.''
   The ruling ended the fourth session of the court, which
addresses controversies involving people and events of the past,
producing often obscure and interesting historical detail.
   Of course, despite the mudslinging, all parties have fun along
the way.

   Dramatizing his point by helping install a
high efficiency lighting fixture, a top Bush administration energy
official Friday outlined energy conservation initiatives he said
could save $32 billion by the year 2000.
   ``Americans are not wasteful by nature,'' W. Henson Moore,
deputy secretary of energy, told a news conference. ``The record is
good, but the record is not good enough.''
   Moore said the initiatives being announced required an
investment of $336 million in the next six years, including $30
million shifted from other Energy Department programs this year.
   The programs range from the use of more efficient lighting
fixtures to exploring possible development of unused hydroelectric
capacity at existing dam sites.
   Moore helped an electrician, Charles Jones, replace a part in a
flourescent lighting fixture, one of 36 in the room where the news
conference was held.
   He said it would increase the efficiency of the fixture by 25
percent, reducing its cost by $6.50 a year.
   The initiatives outlined at the news conference concentrate on
increasing energy efficiency and using renewable energy resources.
   ``Using energy more efficiently under these initiatives will
also avoid damage to the environment by an estimated 800 million
tons of carbon dioxide, 2.3 million tons of sulphur oxides and 2.1
million tons of nitrogen oxides annually,'' Moore said.
   Moore said federal engineers and design specialists will
identify federal buildings to refit with more advanced lighting
technologies.
   He said the department would also explore ways to make it as
profitable for electrical utilities to increase efficiency as to
expand their capacity.
   The department will encourage states and localities to adopt the
voluntary, interim standards the department has formulated for
residential and commercial buildings, Moore said.
   He said the department will establish three new energy analysis
and diagnostic centers per year at engineering schools until it has
increased the current 13 centers to 40.
   The department also plans joint ventures with industry to
demonstate advanced technologies for producing energy from waste,
the deputy secretary said.
   ``A cooperative program with industry will be undertaken to
reduce the time required to transfer technology from the research
laboratory to the private sector from 10 to six years,'' he said.
   He said the department would work with the Department of
Agrigculture and private companies in an effort to make ethanol
fuels from non-food feedstocks a competitive alternative fuel by
the year 2000.
   The department will speed up testing of a prototype for using
concentrated solar energy to break down toxic chemicals into
harmless byproducts in compliance with environmental standards, he
said.
   Also part of the program is development of a laboratory for
solar heat and other technologies in a government-owned building at
the department's Solar Energy Research Institute in Golden, Colo.

<HEAD>Family Sues Navy Over Drowning of Recruit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Navy tried to cover up wrongdoing in
the drowning of a recruit, the victim's family charged in one of
two lawsuits seeking a total of $7 million from the government.
   The lawsuits, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court, stem from
the 1988 death of Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton,
Wis., during a rescue drill at Pensacola Naval Air Station.
   Mirecki's mother, Elaine Kitowski, is seeking $5 million for
wrongful death in one lawsuit. In the other, she is joined by
Mirecki's two sisters and a brother in asking $2 million for severe
emotional distress suffered allegedly because the Navy initially
covered up wrongdoing by instructors.
   Kay Esty, a spokeswoman for the Naval Education and Training
Command headquartered in Pensacola, said it would be inappropriate
for the Navy to comment.
   In 1989 the family filed a $20 million administrative claim
against the Navy, a required preliminary step before going to
court. The Navy has neither accepted nor rejected the claim, so the
family took the inaction as a denial, the lawsuits state.
   Mirecki suffered fear-induced heart failure before drowning in a
swimming pool during training to become a rescue swimmer, according
to court-martial testimony. Rescue swimmers jump from helicopters
to aid downed fliers.
   One instructor, Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Comb of Tucson,
Ariz., was convicted of negligent homicide for forcing Mirecki's
head under water. He was sentenced to 90 days in the brig.
   At a separate court-martial, Lt. Thomas Torchia of Princeton,
Ill., the officer in charge of the Navy Rescue Swimmer School, was
acquitted of dereliction of duty in the March 2, 1988, incident.
   Four other enlisted instructors received fines and reductions in
rank for allegedly forcing Mirecki back into the pool after he had
climbed out, shouting that he wanted to quit the voluntary training
program.
   During the courts-martial, students testified they were ordered
to face away and sing the national anthem while Comb dunked Mirecki.
   Relatives contend it was their persistence in questioning the
circumstances of the death that led to investigations that
confirmed it was not accidental. The Navy has denied any cover-up.

<TEXT>
   On its surface, the Sundance United
States Film Festival is a laid-back celebration of creative cinema,
but underneath the merriment lurks high-stakes dealing.
   Winning, and the momentum it generates, can spell the difference
between obscurity and worldwide fame.
   ``The main intention of this festival isn't to get films sold
but to showcase the best new independently made American films,''
said festival director Tony Safford.
   But it doesn't always work out that way. Selling is crucial.
   After taking the top prize last year for ``sex, lies and
videotape,'' Steve Soderbergh returned to Park City this week to
find that the landscape was changing: Independent movies were
sparking the interest of accountants, not just film enthusiasts.
   ``I'm a little concerned by what `sex, lies' might have wrought
here,'' Soderbergh said, ``that this can become more of a film
market than a film festival.''
   ``Sex, lies and videotape,'' costing $1.1 million, has made more
than $24 million for Miramax Films. ``Roger &amp; Me,'' a documentary
costing $160,000, has collected $2.3 million so far for Warner
Bros. With returns like that, it's not surprising that major
studios are more interested than ever in snapping up distribution
rights to independently made movies.
   ``It's a very complicated business right now because a lot of
the independent distributors have gone out of business,'' said
Caldecot Chubb, co-producer of ``To Sleep With Anger,'' debuting
here.
   ``Warner Bros., Universal and 20th Century Fox all say they want
to release 30 movies a year,'' Chubb said. ``Where are they going
to get those films?''
   Chubb is hopeful they'll come to him. ``To Sleep With Anger,''
starring Danny Glover, is looking for a distributor.
   The distribution problem is complicated by the success of a few
booming independents like Miramax and New Line Cinema.
   ``Films those companies would have picked up two or three years
ago are now too small for them,'' said Michael Spielberg, president
of newcomer Monument Pictures.
   Some who come to the festival aren't interested in sales at all.
   Due to its pro-hunting tone, the only way writer-director George
Butler could distribute his documentary ``In the Blood'' was by
doing it himself.
   ``I had a tremendously difficult time making this movie,''
Butler said. ``The prejudice against hunting is so powerful in the
film industry.''
   Five years in the making, ``In the Blood'' was financed by and
will be distributed through the contributions of 20 investors,
including the hunting-wetland preservation group Ducks Unlimited.

<HEAD>Justices Scheduling Fewer Cases for Arguments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court is being choosier about what
cases it reviews, and as a result the justices won't be on the
bench as much this spring.
   An oral argument schedule for March, released Friday, shows 16
hours of sessions rather than the usual 24.
   The argument sessions, the public's only opportunity to see the
court at work, usually are conducted six days each month for four
hours a day. Each case is allotted one hour.
   The March argument schedule features four three-hour days, and
two hours on each of two remaining days.
   In the past, some justices have complained about trying to
squeeze too much work into the court's nine-month terms.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, in a recent speech, said a
1988 law that gave the court greater discretion over the cases it
chooses to review ``is having a very beneficial impact on the
court's selection of cases.''
   Unless the court takes the unlikely step of giving expedited
review to some cases in the interim, the April schedule also will
be an abbreviated one _ with about the same number of cases argued
as in March.
   Cases granted review from now through the end of the current
term will be argued in the term that begins next October.
   The court in recent years granted review in about 150 of the
some 5,000 cases reaching it annually. At its current pace, the
court is likely to grant substantially fewer cases in its current
term.
   Arguments in granted cases are conducted from October through
April. The court generally announces decisions in each case argued
during those months before taking its summer recess in late June or
early July.

<HEAD>Disciplinary Charges Brought Against 2 Lutheran Congregations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Formal disciplinary charges have been
lodged against two Lutheran congregations that violated church
policy by ordaining three gay ministers who have refused to
renounce sexual relations.
   St. Francis and First United congregations face punishment
ranging from censure to expulsion from the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in American for ``willfully disregarding'' membership
requirements.
   The organization, the largest American Lutheran denomination,
bans ordination of ``self-avowed, practicing homosexuals.'' The
congregations have said they are prepared to accept expulsion.
   All three ministers, who were hired in November by their
congregations, were removed from a list of ordainable clergy after
they refused to agree to celibacy. The practice is often required
of known homosexual pastors but not of heterosexual ones in the
Lutheran tradition.
   Jeff Johnson, 27, was ordained Saturday as assistant pastor at
First United, a working class congregation with no acknowledged
homosexual members. Also Saturday, Ruth Frost, 42, and Phyllis
Zillhart, 32, were ordained at St. Francis, near the predominantly
gay Castro neighborhood.
   ``We find ourselves in a very unpleasant situation forced upon
us by circumstance,'' said Synod Bishop Lyle Miller in a statement
issued Friday. He had warned the congregations they faced possible
expulsion.
   ``I very much support our church's ministry to and with gay and
lesbian people. I have strived to maintain a pastoral relationship
with these two congregations and continue to care for them,'' he
added.
   A consultation team of three pastors and two lay people will be
named to meet with the congregations. If the group cannot resolve
the dispute, a 12-member disciplinary committee will review the
charges.
   The Rev. John Frykman of First United said last week both
congregations are prepared to accept expulsion if necessary.
   ``We see this as what God is asking us to do,'' he said. ``Our
congregation felt this was a social justice issue, that gays are
part of the rainbow coalition of God's creation.''
   The dissident congregations have received support from some
members and clergy in the 5.2 million-member Lutheran organization,
formed by the merger of three smaller groups in 1988.
   Lutheran churches in some northern European countries have
ordained so-called active homosexual ministers with approval from
denomination leaders.

<TEXT>
   President Bush will propose a $24.6 billion
education budget for 1991 on Monday that bolsters math and science
initiatives while cutting the biggest loan program for college
students, an official familiar with the plan said.
   The proposal, in an area Bush has called one of his priorities,
represents a $500 million increase over this year's spending levels
_ about half of what would be needed to keep abreast of inflation.
   The president will call for $1.8 billion in increases over 1990
levels in some programs and $1.3 billion in cuts in others for a
net increase of $500 million, the official said on Thursday. The
plan will be part of the $1.23 trillion budget for fiscal 1991 _
which begins Oct. 1 _ Bush unveils on Monday.
   The spending blueprint drew sour reviews Friday from several
education lobbyists who complained that the increases did not go
far enough and that the cuts should not be made.
   ``Overall it's an inadequate investment,'' said Gerald Morris,
deputy director of legislation for the American Federation of
Teachers, the nation's second-largest teachers' union. ``We think
education in a lot of respects has been bled dry.''
   Among the victims of Bush's cuts will be the Guaranteed Student
Loan program, which will be pared by $500 million to a level of
$3.3 billion. The program made 3.7 million loans to undergraduate
and graduate students last year, making it the government's biggest
student loan effort.
   Another $155 million will be slashed from the Perkins loan
program for low-income college students, and $60 million more will
be saved by eliminating federal grants that help states run their
own student-aid efforts.
   The cuts angered Becky Timmons, director of congressional
liaison for the American Council on Education, which represents
colleges and universities.
   ``In my view, that's a step back to the time when only the sons
and daughters of the privileged were encouraged to attend
college,'' she said.
   Bush will also propose scaling back federal assistance to
libraries from $140 million to $40 million.
   Two other programs for low-income students will be increased.
   Bush will ask lawmakers to increase the Pell Grants program,
which provides money to low-income college students, by $473
million over the current $4.8 billion, enough to keep pace with
inflation. Because the grants are financed in advance, the increase
covers the school year that begins in the fall of 1991.
   But the budget will also say that because of across-the-board
cuts included in this year's budget, the Pell Grants program will
be cut next fall by $66.5 million, the official said. The document
will state that as a result, about 14,000 students receiving awards
averaging $200 will lose their grants, and 1.3 million other
students will have their stipends cut by $50.
   The proposal will ask for $230 million _ $100 million more than
this year _ for math and science programs.
   A $350 million increase will be sought for so-called Chapter One
programs, which provide assistance to low-income public and private
school students, raising that spending to $5.8 billion, the source
said.
   Bush will renew his past proposals to spend $100 million for
magnet schools, and another $225 million for schools that show
improved student performance, no drug problems and lower dropout
rates.
   Other increases will include a $50 million increase to $590
million for drug prevention and anti-abuse programs, and an $80
million increase, to $2.1 billion, for handicapped student aid.
   The president will also seek a $50 million increase, to $240
million, for adult education and literacy initiatives; near
doubling, from $95 million to $175 million, of efforts to analyze
the adequacy of education programs; and $70 million more for the
Education Department's management budget, bringing it to $400
million.
   He will also ask for $25 million to train principals, and $20
million to assess the results of the meeting Bush held last
September with the nation's governors to discuss education problems.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's splintered pro-democracy
groups agreed Friday to form a government with embattled Communist
Premier Hans Modrow on the condition that all Cabinet members
renounce their party loyalties.
   The surprise show of unity among the fractious political groups
followed the announcement by Christian Democrats that they were
pulling out of Modrow's 27-member Cabinet, presumably to distance
themselves from the distrusted Communists and boost their election
chances.
   East Germany's Christian Democratic Union is one of four small
parties that stood by the Communists through their 40-year monopoly
on power.
   One of the conditions set by the pro-democracy groups currently
unrepresented in the government was that the officially recognized
small parties join the coalition as well.
   Reform movements such as New Forum and Democratic Awakening do
not want the official parties to escape responsibility for the
disastrous state of the East German economy.
   In announcing the agreement to join Modrow's interim government,
Wolfgang Ullmann of the Democracy Now movement said the various
opposition forces would take part only if all Cabinet members
agreed to give up their political affiliations until the May 6
elections.
   Ullmann said Modrow had been informed of their decision and was
willing to meet with the groups on Sunday to discuss details of
which ministries might be offered to the new groups.
   It was not immediately clear whether Modrow or the other
ministers are willing to renounce their party affiliations, as
demanded by the reform activists.
   Nor did the Christian Democrats indicate whether they would
rejoin Modrow, although a show of solidarity would be likely if the
other obstacles to a grand coalition can be overcome.
   West German politicians from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party had
praised the Christian Democrat's decision to leave the East German
leadership as a clear break with its Communist-aligned past.
   Until recent days, Modrow had enjoyed Bonn's endorsement as a
caretaker leader pending the nation's first-ever free elections.
   But West Germans have become increasingly concerned about the
hopeless outlook for East German recovery that is driving 2,000
East Germans to the West each day.
   Conservative politicians such as Kohl now appear eager to help
an alternative force gain strength in East Germany.
   The many pro-democracy groups have proven themselves too
unorganized to mount a serious campaign challenge, leaving many
voters fearful the Communists could retain the leadership after the
elections.
   The Christian Democrats resigned its three ministerial posts
effective Feb. 9, pressuring Modrow to build a new government by
then that would include the pro-democracy groups.
   The opposition politicians insisted their parties be given
ministerial seats in order to gain experience in governing and to
influence decisions that will affect the nation's future.
   Some groups opposed entering the government on the grounds that
their participation could open them to blame for the nation's
daunting problems. But after more than eight hours of negotiations
Friday, Ullmann announced the parties had forged a united strategy.
   Modrow, a relatively respected Communist reformer, was chosen to
lead after massive protests ousted the hard-line regime last year.
But a worsening economy and the continued exodus of his people has
brought a resurgence in dissent.
   The decision by Deputy Premier Lothar de Maiziere and two fellow
Christian Democrats to pull out of Modrow's government was
portrayed by the party as a way to allow the newer opposition
groups to join the government.
   But the pullout also allowed the Christian Democrats to flee a
sinking Communist ship.
   Steffen Reiche, whose Social Democratic Party has no
representation in the government, called the Christian Democrats'
departure ``the crowning irresponsibility of its 40-year service.''
   Reiche was quoted by the official ADN news agency as saying his
party would not accept Cabinet posts unless the Christian Democrats
did likewise.
   In Vienna Friday for meetings with Austrian officials, Modrow
told reporters he was making a ``fair offer'' of a coalition to
East Germany's opposition groups.
   Modrow, also seeming to distance himself from the party,
criticized the Communist Party for being too slow in moving away
from its Stalinist past and the abuses of Erich Honecker's corrupt
rule.
   Communists now hold 16 ministerial posts, the Liberal Democrats
four, the Christian Democrats three, and the National Democrats and
farmers' party two each.

   Edward C. Corrigan, father of Christa
McAuliffe, the teacher-astronaut who along with six other crew
members was killed in the Challenger space shuttle explosion four
years ago, has died. He was 67.
   Corrigan died Thursday after a struggle against cancer.
   He also had fought to make sense of his daughter's death seconds
after the space shuttle's lift-off ended in a fiery explosion.
   ``He missed Christa every day of his life,'' said Corrigan's
wife of 42 years, Grace. ``We incorporated her in everything,
because she was part of us. He spent the last four years doing what
she had left undone.''
   In recent years, Corrigan had traveled from Alaska to Jordan to
deliver lectures on his daughter's behalf at school and scholarship
dedications, fund-raisers and the annual Governor's Ski
Invitational in New Hampshire.
   ``We all knew he was sick,'' said Harold Masterman, a founder of
the Christa McAuliffe annual fund-raising scholarship dinner.
   ``I thought he was a very strong and courageous person. He had a
great sense of humor, and he handled the tragedy very
courageously,'' Masterman said.
   Corrigan, who was a retired accountant, is survived by his wife,
two sons and two daughters. A funeral was scheduled Sunday, the
fourth anniversary of his daughter's death.

<TEXT>
   BUCHAREST, Romaniasident Dumitru Mazilu resigned
Friday because, he said, ``Stalinist methods'' are being used by
the government that took over when the dictator Nicolae Ceause (AP) _ Vice
Prescu
was deposed and executed.
   Mazilu, who had been under pressure to quit because of ties he
once had to to Ceausescu, made the announcement on Radio Free
Europe.
   Also Thursday, Manea Manescu, one of the four Ceausescu henchmen
facing trial Saturday, said in an interview he was only a ``simple
executioner of orders.''
   Manescu expressed regrets that he did not try to prevent the
thousands of deaths in the uprising that ousted Ceausescu on Dec.
22.
   Ion Iliescu, president of the provisional government, has
castigated critics of the decision by his governing National
Salvation Front to run candidates in elections.
   Iliescu denied in a national television address that the Front
ever said it would no' he said.
   On Saturday, the Front is to discuss financing, access to the
media and a proposed electoral law with representatives of the 15
new and revived parties planning to contest the elections.
   Gheorghe Copil, an adviser to the head of the Peasants Party,
accused the Front of being a ``destabilizing force'' and said his
party had not decided whether to attend.
   The Peasants Party, Liberal Party and Social Democratic Party
have demanded the Front resign and appoint an administration of all
parties to govern until the elections.
   More than 300 students defied a ban on protests for a second
night Friday and demonstrated outside Front headquarters demanding
the resignation of its leadership. A double line of tanks and
soldiers blocked their path to the the building, the former Foreign
Ministry on Victory Square.
   Mazilu telephoned Radio Free Europe and read this statement of
resignation:
   ``Taking account with profound sorrow and deep distress that the
Stalinist methods and practices are maintained, that label are
being still used based on security files and accusations imposed
under threat, that the press is still directed to destroy some
people and promote others, I resign from my position, which, as you
may remember, I stated from the first day that I did not want.
   ``I am convinced that those who have carried out the revolution
will never accept that it be taken over by people who haven't given
anything of themselves to it.
   ``Wholeheartedly, I remain on the people's side. I shall forever
remain devoted to democracy, freedom and ideals of dignity, which
have inspired the youth of the country in its fight against
tyranny. I shall never forget their sacrifices.''
   In 1986, Mazilu was asked by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights
in Geneva, of which he was a member, to write a report on human
rights and youth in Romania.
   He was never allowed to return to Switzerland. His report,
focusing on what he termed ``nightmarish'' conditions in Romania,
was smuggled out and made public in Geneva last August.
   When his past as a colonel in Ceausescu's Securitate secret
police was disclosed in a newspaper report after the revolution,
Mazilu ignored calls for his resignation and was defended by other
Front leaders.
   Silviu Brucan, the Front spokesman on foreign affairs, noted at
a news conference Jan. 18 few other people in Ceausescu's Romania
had the courage to speak out against the dictator's policies.
   Manescu, the former Ceausescu associate, was vice president of
the State Council and a member of the ruling Communist Party
Politburo.
   In an interview published Saturday by the daily Romania Libera,
he was quoted as saying the dictator would never have surrendered
power peacefully and ``the revolution by the Romanian people ...
was the only alternative.''
   Manescu's co-defendants are Emil Bobu, No. 3 in the regime
behind Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, who were executed Dec. 25;
former Interior Minister Tudor Polstelnicu, who was responsible for
the Securitate, and Ion Dinca, another Politburo member.

   Deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega claimed
status as a prisoner of war under the Geneva Convention and asked
today to be moved to a neutral third country to avoid trial on U.S.
drug charges.
   The claim was mailed to President Bush in a letter signed by
Noriega, who listed his title as commander-in-chief of the
Panamanian Defense Force. A copy was contained in a motion filed in
federal court by defense attorney Frank Rubino.
   Rejecting the court's jurisdiction, Rubino said he would
``respectfully decline'' to participate in a scheduled pretrial
detention hearing. But U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler ordered
the hearing to continue. As expected, he denied bond, ruling that
the defense had not rebutted the prosecution's contention that
Noriega might flee the country if freed on bail.
   The hearing opened with Noriega appearing in uniform and Rubino
reading his motion into the court record.
   The defense contended Noreiga, who was whisked out of Panama on
Jan. 3 to face a 1988 drug indictment in Miami, was a political
prisoner captured as the result of an illegal military invasion in
violation of international conventions, treaties and accords.
   The motion recounted events leading up to Noriega's arrest
outside the papal nunciature in Panama City, including American
troops' use of high-intensity lights and loudspeakers playing rock
'n' roll music.
   The judge acknowledged receipt of the motion but called it
untimely and said he would give the prosecution time to respond.
   The government, not the defense, demanded the bond hearing,
concerned that failure to guarantee Noriega the opportunity could
jeopardize their case in both the legal and political arenas.
   Rubino refused to ask for bond because Noriega does not
recognize U.S. jurisdiction and, he said earlier, because ``I don't
file motions I don't expect to win.''
   A Noriega co-defendant won a small victory Thursday when a
federal judge refused to order an immediate trial in a parallel
indictment.
   Brian Alden Davidow was one of 15 people accused of cocaine
trafficking in February 1988 along with Noriega. He also was
indicted in a second case the same day.
   After two years of delays in the second indictment, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Barbara Schwartz on Thursday asked for an immediate
trial for Davidow, over the objections of his attorney, Richard
Sharpstein.
   ``I think they're using this tool for leverage to make us more
amenable to plea bargaining,'' Sharpstein told Chief U.S. District
Judge James L. King.
   The judge said he was surprised by the U.S. attorney's decision
to go ahead with the trial, and Ms. Schwartz's contention it would
take only a few days. The judge said the original prosecutor told
him the case would be complex.
   ``I was told it would be a preview of the Noriega case with the
same witnesses and the same evidence,'' King said.
   The judge delayed Davidow's trial for several weeks until it was
clear whether Noriega's trial would take place as scheduled March
5, and whether Davidow's case would be separated from the larger
trial.
   Meanwhile, defense attorneys continued a barrage of motions
aimed at forcing the government to turn over documents to be used
against the Noriega defendants.
   An attorney for Noriega co-defendant Daniel Miranda, a pilot
accused of flying laundered drug profits, has filed a separate
motion asking that Hoeveler appoint an independent caretaker for
evidence seized during last month's invasion of Panama.
   ``There have been reports of almost 50 tons of documents seized
by the United States,'' wrote attorney Michael O'Kane. ``The
government has shown that it cannot act responsibly to preserve
these documents.''
   And an attorney for another co-defendant, former Noriega aide
and accused money-launderer Luis del Cid, has filed papers
demanding immediate access to the evidence the government used in
the original February 1988 drug-trafficking indictment.
   Prosecutors have sought to delay handing over evidence, arguing
investigators must sift through thousands of documents seized
during the invasion of Panama, but del Cid's lawyer Samuel Burstyn
rejected that explanation.
   ``The fact that the government may develop further evidence
which it would have a duty to tender in no way suspends its duty to
furnish to the defense evidence that it already has in its
possession,'' Burstyn wrote.
   The U.S. attorney's office refuses to comment on the motions
until court hearings, said spokeswoman Diane Cossin.

<TEXT>
   Citizens angry about decades of environmental
abuse forced authorities to curb imports of West German waste
Friday and reassess East Germany's policy of accepting foreign
garbage in return for hard currency.
   Since taking office two weeks ago, Environment Minister Peter
Diederich had promised to cut the waste trade that he said has
netted the nation nearly $590 million in badly needed foreign
exchange in the past 15 years.
   But the government's hand was forced after area residents
Thursday blocked sites at Schoeneiche and Vorketzin, south of
Berlin in East Germany, where West Berlin and West Germany dump
more than 1 million tons of garbage annually.
   West German environmentalists say about 100,000 tons of
dangerous waste discarded each year for a decade have polluted
groundwater at both landfills, where practically no ecological
precautions have been taken.
   Diederich has called for Vorketzin to be closed but denied there
is any danger for humans.
   East Germany, which previously knew virtually no environmental
protest, was a discreet dumping ground for ever-rising mountains of
garbage from highly industrialized West Germany.
   But since last fall's peaceful democratic revolution, East
Germans have started railing against evidence of widespread
pollution damage wrought under 40 years of Communist rule.
   That makes state-sponsored ``garbage tourism'' a rising problem
for both Germanys at a time when they are working on ever-closer
ties.
   ``East Germany cannot continue to offer garbage disposal for
other countries as it has in the past,'' said Berthold Goeke, a
West German Environment Ministry spokesman.
   ``That will increase the pressure on us,'' he said by telephone
from Bonn.
   Friday's East German measures included an indefinite ban on West
Berlin shipments of toxic waste, which includes paints, solvents,
oils and asbestos-laced cement that the city is gradually scrapping.
   Also barred were West German exports of industrial and sewage
sludge, the state-run news agency ADN said. Diederich urged the
Foreign Trade Ministry to renegotiate the agreement governing that
trade.
   West Berlin, an urban island in the midst of East Germany,
trucks most of its waste to the surrounding countryside. The
business is regulated by a 20-year contract running through 1994.
   Since East Germany opened the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, officials
from both sides of the city have launched talks on a costly dump
cleanup and new ways to distribute West Berlin's garbage.
   West Germany and West Berlin account for more than 80 percent of
East German garbage imports totaling 5.5 million tons a year,
according to Diederich.
   East Germany also solicited dangerous waste from Switzerland,
Austria, the Netherlands and Italy.
   For example, Switzerland, which has tough environmental laws,
has trucked hundreds of tons of spent household batteries to East
Germany annually. The batteries usually contain dangerous heavy
metals such as mercury and zinc.
   But the money East Germany made seems likely to be dwarfed by
the cost of any comprehensive cleanup and damage awards that
citizens have begun demanding.
   Diederich's predecessor in the Communist-led Cabinet, Hans
Reichelt, quit Jan. 9, citing his age of 65. Reichelt had been
widely accused of failing to resist policies that have turned East
Germany into one of Eastern Europe's most polluted countries.
   On Friday, Diederich announced the international environmental
group Greenpeace has been given official approval to begin work in
East Germany.
   A government commission called for five heavily polluting
enterprises in the Leipzig area to be shut down by December 1991,
three years ahead of schedule.

   Paramedic Jeff Race didn't have enough
time to be startled when a jet plane crashed a half mile from his
home. Too many people needed help.
   ``There were bodies on top of bodies on top of bodies,'' said
Race, 26, the first rescuer to reach the secluded wooded area where
Avianca Flight 52 crashed Thursday night.
   ``People were screaming, `Help me, help me, help me.' Limbs were
bent every way you can imagine. I just started pulling people from
the wreckage,'' said Race.
   The wreckage was located off Tennis Court Road, the only road
into and out of the affluent section of Long Island. Race borrowed
a flashlight from a neighbor and pulled out six children while
ambulances were called to the scene.
   Through several hours in the dark and drizzle, Race freed 12
more people.
   ``One guy pinned in the wreckage had a little boy next to him.
He said, `Get the kid out first.' I'll never forget that,'' said
the paramedic.
   ``I had to hold the flashlight strap in my teeth to carry
another kid out. There were bodies all over the place _ outside the
plane, and buried in the wreckage. It was all mangled metal,
aluminum, steel, and wires,'' he said.
   Race, a New York City paramedic and volunteer member of the
Oyster Bay Fire Company, spooned soup from a foam cup and munched
cookies after his exhausting night. He stood in the rain in his
Docksiders because he didn't have time to put on his fireman's
boots.
   ``We're trained to prepare for the worst, but my first reaction
was that this was a dream,'' Race said.
   ``I think it was a miracle for anybody on the plane to be
alive,'' said Race. ``Hero? Everybody who was there was a hero.''
   The plane crashed in a secluded hamlet of 400 residents that
covers three square miles on Oyster Bay Harbor, which is part of
Long Island Sound. Any new home requires four acres for a building
permit.
   The parents of tennis pro John McEnroe have an estate here and a
temporary morgue was set up on their lawn across from a private
outdoor tennis court.
   Pop singer Billy Joel once owned a home here, and Race's parents
live on a cottage that was once part of Theodore Roosevelt's
estate. The ex-president is buried in nearby Sagamore Hill.
   The community's normal calm was pierced by a procession of
wailing police cars and ambulances. Helicopters roared overhead and
landed in the flare-lit zones to whisk away the injured.
   ``If anything looks like a war, this has got to be it,'' said
Race. ``We couldn't get the live people out because they were
buried under the dead people.''
   The plane clipped a path through the tree line before it plowed
into an embankment.
   Most of the passengers were still buckled in their seats. But
Race said one woman's seat was thrown from the plane and perched on
top the orange and white fuselage, while another woman had to
pulled down from a tree.
   The airplane lay in three pieces. The cockpit section had broken
off the deck on Sam Tissenbaum's home, and the tail section lay
across the road just 100 yards from Rick Robinson's two story green
cottage.
   Robinson, 53, was watching ``The Dave Thomas Comedy Show'' on
television with his 79-year-old mother when he heard a disturbance
and went out to investigate.
   ``It was a scraping noise, like a tree falling or a snowplow
dragging along the road. I didn't hear any engine noise,'' said
Robinson, a sports writer for the Oyster Bay Guardian.
   He returned to the house for a flashlight without realizing what
had happened.
   ``A wire burst into flame and I could see the outline of the
plane. I could just hear them feebly crying for help,'' said
Robinson. ``It's amazing it didn't explode. It just crumpled. It's
shocking how close it came to my house.''

<HEAD>Bush Calls on Mayors to Support His Anti-Drug Strategy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush asked the nation's mayors to
support his new anti-drug strategy Friday, but urban leaders voiced
``strong disagreement'' with his answers for drugs and other urban
problems.
   Bush appealed to the U.S. Conference of Mayors one day after
presenting his revised plan for fighting drugs, which adds $1.1
billion in federal spending but was criticized by mayors as too
little.
   ``I ask you to support our strategy to take back the streets
from crime and drugs,'' Bush said.
   Bush offered the mayors no specifics and no new initiatives on
urban problems beyond the second phase of his drug program outlined
a day earlier. He repeated his call for more private efforts,
saying Americans are willing to help, and pledged to use his
``bully pulpit'' to ask for volunteers.
   ``Let's join hands to inspire the millions of Americans who want
to help America get clean and stay clean,'' he said. ``Together,
let's defeat public enemy No. 1.''
   Bush's appearance at the conclusion of the big-city mayors'
annual winter meeting was the first time an incumbent president has
spoken to the overwhelmingly Democratic group since Jimmy Carter in
1980.
   Mayors interviewed after the speech said they appreciated the
symbolic support his appearance provided but that he had offered
the cities little.
   ``We certainly appreciate the fact the president showed up here
today,'' said Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, a Democrat. ``I think
there is strong disagreement as to how to proceed to address some
of the issues of urban America that have been ignored for such a
long period of time.''
   Mayor Kathyrn Whitmire of Houston, president of the conference
and the elected leader of Bush's adopted hometown, said the size of
Bush's drug proposal _ $10.6 billion _ was too small.
   ``We have not yet seen a level of commitment in line with the
size of the problem,'' she said.
   Whitmire was invited by Bush to spend Friday night at the White
House, and she said she hoped to use the opportunity to discuss her
objections to the drug plan.
   Whitmire, a Democrat, said she was ``pleased'' Bush addressed
urban problems in his speech and said it suggested his
administration would be more receptive to the mayors than President
Reagan was.
   ``I think his presence here indicates a little more willinginess
to discuss those disagreements and see if something can be worked
out,'' she said.
   Besides the size of the drug program, she said mayors object to
the administration's insistence on routing aid to local governments
through state governments, which mayors say don't pass along the
full amount. She also said mayors want a commitment from Bush to
provide enough money so that any drug abuser needing treatment can
receive it.
   Bush told the mayors his drug proposal for education, treatment,
interdiction and enforcement amounted to ``a 41 percent increase in
outlays over the current year, and means a 69 percent increase in
drug-related spending overall since our administration took
office.''
   Whitmire, however, said, ``the increase is there, but it is much
smaller, generally below 10 percent.''
   ``I like what he said about education,'' said Mayor Karen Vialle
of Tacoma, Wash. ``But we need the bucks to do it.''
   The mayors' meeting ended with some of the first indirect
criticism of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp
that's been heard in public meetings of urban officials. Kemp, the
former professional football player and congressman, was invited
but did not attend the three-day meeting because he was attending
Super Bowl-related events, said J. Thomas Cochrane, executive
director of the conference of mayors.
   Several of Kemp's assistants engaged in a sometimes contentious
debate with members of the mayors' housing and community
development committee.
   Mayor Jessie M. Rattley of Newport News, Va., chairman of that
panel, said later that the mayors were told by the HUD officials
that mayors are ``really the cause of the problem'' in some of the
scandal-plagued agency's programs, and that new accounting
procedures in one program were to make the mayors ``accountable.''
   ``As one mayor, I'm unwilling to accept that accusation,''
Rattley said.

<TEXT>
   Poland's beleaguered Communists begin a
party congress Saturday at which they are expected to change their
name, shed the old ideology and declare themselves champions of
parliamentary democracy.
   They also intend to choose new leaders they hope can mold the
new incarnation into the main left-wing party of Poland's new
political spectrum.
   About 1,600 delegates will attend the 11th congress of the
party, which ruled Poland from its founding in 1948 until the
government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, led by Solidarity,
took over last year.
   The congress will continue at least until Monday, and insiders
say the party is in such disarray it is difficult to predict what
will happen.
   Politburo member Janusz Reykowski said no one in the party
advocates a split, but it is possible either orthodox Communists or
extreme liberals may bolt and form their own group.
   Reykowski said in an interrview Thursday the party now claims 2
million members, but the new party will be much smaller.
   ``It is a necessity to lose a great majority of the members,''
he said. ``It is inevitable. ... The problem is rather what kind of
people remain, whether those who remain are based on the old guard
or are those oriented toward a completely new way of political
activity.''
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and Communist members of
Parliament have expressed support for Tadeusz Fiszbach as leader of
the new party. He is a former party chief in Gdansk, Walesa's
hometown, who was dismissed because he opposed the imposition of
martial law in December 1981.
   Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, the current leader, said early in
January he would be a candidate, but he appeared to be
reconsidering this week because of arguments that only new
leadership will give the party a chance.
   When asked at a news conference Friday whether he would seek the
job, he replied: ``I don't have the answer to this question today.''
   Reykowski, the Politburo member, said neither Rakowski nor
Fiszbach would be chosen if delegates felt the time had come for a
``clear generational change.''
   Possible candidates from the new generation are Slawomir Wiatr,
founder of a liberal party faction called the 8th of July Movement,
and Leszek Miller, a Rakowski loyalist and party secretary.
   The Communist Party, formally named the Polish United Workers
Party, was created by a forced merger in Stalin's days of the
Polish Workers Party and the Polish Socialist Party, a left-wing
group founded in the 19th century that enjoyed broad support
between the world wars.
   Now, the party says, it wants to shed its Communist identity and
become a party of social democrats in the old Socialist tradition.
   A draft policy declaration to be presented to the congress
harshly criticizes the past.
   It finds the party guilty of ``crimes committed during
Stalinism, departing from democratic principles, conflicts with the
working class, the impoverishment of the intelligentsia and the
present economic and social crisis.''
   On the other hand, it defends the ``patriotism'' and ``honest
commitment'' of millions of party members and says Stalinism was
imposed at a time of ``limited state sovereignty'' _ shorthand for
Soviet domination in the 1940s and 1950s.
   The Communists' ``sources of strength and ability to regain
popular trust have dwindled to the point of exhaustion,'' the
resolution says. ``The time has come to build a new party of the
left.''
   Names being considered are: Socialist Party of Poland, Socialist
Party of Working People, Social Democratic Party of Poland, Polish
Party of Working People, Polish Party of the Socialist Left and
Polish Labor Party.
   Parliamentary elections in June were an overwhelming victory for
Solidarity, demonstrating the party's lack of popularity.
   Not one of the 100 freely contested Senate seats went to a party
candidate. Senior party leaders running unopposed for Parliament
seats on a ``national list'' were rejected by more than half the
voters.
   Government funding ended when Mazowiecki's government took over
in August, forcing the party to lay off many employees and seek new
ways of raising money. Those included renting out office space and
operating garages and driving schools.
   Fully democratic local elections scheduled for April probably
will end party power in town and city halls, its last bastions.
   Grass roots pressure has grown for confiscation of the party's
extensive property, which many Poles believe was acquired illegally
during four decades of absolute power.
   Bureaucrats who enjoyed comfortable positions in state
enterprises or institutions based on party affiliation fear the
prospect of dismissal and see the property as their hedge against
poverty.

<HEAD>Boston Mayor Says Bush Pleased With Police Handling of Stuart Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boston Mayor Ray Flynn got some praise for his
police force's handling of the Stuart murder case in Boston from
President Bush, the mayor said Friday.
   Flynn, a Democrat who has been a critic of the president, shared
the platform with Bush when the president spoke to the U.S.
Conference of Mayors meeting.
   Afterward, Flynn said Bush had spoken to him about the case and
passed along praise for Boston Police Commissioner Francis
``Mickey'' Roache.
   ``He came up to me and said, `You tell Mickey Roache,' our
police commissioner, `he's doing a wonderful job in that Stuart
case and we're with him all the way,''' Flynn said.
   Boston's police force and Flynn have come under criticism for
the initial reaction to the shooting death of a pregnant white
woman, Carol Stuart, after leaving a childbirth class last October.
Charles Stuart, her husband, suffered a gunshot wound in the
stomach and said they were attacked by a black mugger. Authorities
now say Stuart probably shot his wife and himself. He killed
himself Jan. 4 as the purported scheme was coming to light.
   Flynn recalled the president's comments as he helped deliver the
mayors' response to Bush's speech, saying he found Bush ``a very
warm fellow'' although they disagreed on how to solve urban
problems.
   ``I appreciate that,'' he said of Bush's comments. ``That's a
nice thing to hear. That's the kind of person the president is. We
respect him for it. But on the issues, substantively, there's a
long way to go.''
   Bush has been pleased by Boston's police before. During his 1988
campaign for president against Democrat Michael Dukakis, the
governor of Massachusetts, Bush flew to the city to receive the
endorsement of the Boston Police Patrolmen's Union.
   Flynn said the president told him he had tried to call the mayor
at his home recently and spoke with Flynn's 9-year-old daughter.
Flynn said he told Bush he never got the message, and joked that
maybe his daughter didn't know who Bush was.

   President Bush's new budget proposals will
include more money for fish, wildlife and recreation plus a cutback
in timber sales, Forest Service Chief F. Dale Robertson told The
Associated Press on Friday.
   ``When the president unveils his budget to the Congress on
Monday, you're going to see a bigger shift in our programs than
ever before in one year,'' Robertson said in an interview. ``And
you're going to see increases in these programs that the forest
supervisors ... are concerned about.''
   Forest supervisors and others in the Agriculture Department
agency have questioned the conduct of their basic mission,
particularly as it relates to wildlife, ecology and the public's
use of 156 national forests in 43 states, a total area equal to
California, Oregon and Washington combined.
   Robertson did not provide details of the plan, but he added that
``you will see a lower timber target and expanded programs in fish,
wildlife and recreation, and soil and water'' in fiscal 1991, which
will begin Oct. 1.
   ``We're moving and we're changing the balance of our program,''
he said. ``But _ you know how Washington works _ you just can't do
that overnight.''
   Robertson commented just after a week-long quarterly meeting
with regional foresters and research station directors, where he
outlined some of the president's proposals, which need
congressional approval, for the coming year.
   Complaints have smoldered for months about what forest
supervisors perceive as a decline in the agency's multiple-use
function, notably a concentration on timber production and sales at
the expense of other programs.
   A November letter to Robertson supervisors in the Forest
Service's Region 1 said there was ``growing concern that we have
become an organization out of control.'' Region 1 includes Montana,
northern Idaho, North Dakota and western South Dakota.
   Robertson said he did not consider the complaints as indicative
of rebellion in the ranks of the agency and that debate has always
been encouraged.
   ``I see that as a strength,'' he said. ``It may come across to
the press or outside people as a big rebellion, but I see it as
strength when we're able to talk about some of these things.''
   One of the complaints has been that the Forest Service timber
program has taken 35 percent of the agency's total budget for the
last 20 years, compared with 2 percent to 3 percent each for
recreation, fish and wildlife, and soil and water programs.
   ``That is true,'' Robertson said. ``It has been heavily oriented
toward timber.''
   But for some time, he added, the public has had a voice in
Forest Service operations and has urged more attention to
recreation and ecological programs.
   ``We now have forest plans out there that say we're going to do
that'' Robertson said. ``The forest supervisors are experiencing
some frustration. They've worked with the public in a forest plan,
and we've said we're going to do that.''
   But the federal budget for such changes tends to lag behind the
plans. The task now, he said, is to ``rearrange our budget more in
line with what the forest plans say we ought to do.''
   Robertson said the changes and rearrangements come slowly,
however, under the tight federal spending constraints now in place.
``You just don't turn that thing around overnight,'' he said.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, told the foresters Tuesday that the agency ``has not
done enough to protect the environment'' and that, ``too often, it
has given achieving timber harvest levels a higher priority than
preserving the rest of the forest ecosystem.''
   Robertson said Leahy's recommendation that the Forest Service
work with a broader segment of Congress instead of pursuing
parochial interests was well taken.
   Many issues, such as the endangered spotted owl and old-growth
timber, ``are being nationalized'' by being of interest to a wide
section of America, including Congress, he said.
   Asked to predict what may happen to Forest Service timber sales
by the year 2000, Robertson said sales have ``kind of stabilized''
since rising in the 1960s and early 1970s. Now, he said, they are
edging down and probably will continue to do so.

<HEAD>Pope Decries Hardships That Forced Emigration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MINDELO, Cape Verde (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Friday decried
the hardships that have forced hundreds of thousands of citizens of
this African archipelago to emigrate to the United States and
Europe.
   In a speech to tens of thousands of people gathered on a dirt
soccer field, the pope said the former Portuguese colony had been
``greatly tried by suffering'' as a result of its harsh climate,
scare natural resources and problems of hunger and malnutrition.
   ``In this situation, the lack of real prospects for the future
lead many of your brothers and sisters to a forced emigration
toward other nations and continents, with all the problems
involved,'' he said on the second day of his eight-day, five-nation
African tour.
   As a light rain fell in Cape Verde's cultural and economic
capital on Sao Vicente Island, the pope said he understood the
problems of trying to adjust to a new society without losing one's
cultural identity.
   ``Who knows how many of those of you here haven't already had
the difficult experience of having to leave your own land?'' he
said, speaking in Portuguese.
   John Paul urged all institutions dealing with emigration to
``safeguard personal dignity (of emigrants) and favor their free
and responsible participation in community and social life.''
   While expressing understanding and solidarity with Cape Verdians
living abroad, the pope urged them not to forget the country and
the families they left behind.
   ``In finding bread and better living conditions in far away
lands, never forget your native soil and the people who live
there,'' he said.
   Up to 700,000 Cape Verdians _ nearly double the current
population of 360,000 _ live and work abroad, mainly in the United
States, Portugal, France, The Netherlands and Italy.
   There are an estimated 350,000 to 400,000 Cape Verdians in the
United States mostly in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The biggest
community is found in New Bedford, Mass.
   The Rev. Paulino Andrade, a Franciscan priest, attending the
Mindelo service, said his sister moved to Massachusetts eight years
ago and his two brothes were planning to join her soon.
   ``Life is better there,'' he said. ``There is more work and
better salaries. There is no comparison to life here.''
   Cape Verde's economy depends heavily on remittances from its
emigrants, accounting for about 15 percent of the gross national
product.
   The United States provides $6 million a year to Cape Verde,
making it the second-highest recipient per capita of U.S. foreign
aid in Africa after Egypt, diplomats said.
   The money finances projects to stop soil erosion, promote
reforestation and encourage more foreign, private investment.
   The steady drizzle that lasted most of the day delighted Cape
Verdians, who last year measured their total rainfall in minutes.
Located in the sub-Saharan Sahel region 300 miles west of Senegal,
the barren wind-swept islands are often prone to drought.
   After the Mindelo service the pope flew back to the capital
Cidade da Praia to celebrate Mass on the Quebra Canela beach. As
tens of thousands of faithful kneeled on the black volcanic sand
and small fishing boats bobbed in the choppy bay he recalled the
country's past as a slave-trading center and condemned ``every kind
of discrimination.''
   John Paul leaves Saturday for Guinea Bissau. His sixth trip to
Africa will also take him to Mali, Burkina Faso and Chad.

   A U.S. Marine Corps Harrier support fighter jet
crashed Friday off Okinawa and a search has begun for its pilot,
the U.S. military announced.
   The one-seat AV-8B Harrier aircraft was flying from Kadena Air
Base on Okinawa Island to Osan Air Base in South Korea when it went
down, according to the United States Forces, Japan.
   A search is under way for the pilot, whose name was withheld
pending notification of relatives, the military said.
   Three Japanese coast guard patrol ships and a helicopter were
sent to the scene near Iheijima Island, about 88 miles northeast of
Naha, Okinawa, said a night duty officer of the Japan Maritime
Safety Agency.
   The Japanese coast guard officer said the aircraft, which was
flying in formation with another Harrier, crashed 23 miles
northeast of Iheijima.
   The U.S. military said the USS St. Louis was diverted to the
area to help in the search.
   Herbert Nakayoshi, a spokesman for the Marine Corps on Okinawa,
said the Marines' Harriers in Japan are based in Iwakuni, in
southwestern Japan, but regularly operate out of Kadena Air Base.
   The plane that crashed was assigned to Marine Attack Squadron
542 and based at Iwakuni on a six-month deployment program. The
squadron's home base is at Cherry Point, N.C.
   The cause of the accident is under investigation.

<HEAD>Automakers Criticize Senate Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emission control and fuel efficiency standards
in a Senate clean air bill would drive some dealers out of business
and give consumers a drastically narrower selection of cars,
automakers said Friday.
   In an unusual move, representatives of fiercely competitive
domestic and foreign manufacturers held a joint news conference to
criticize portions of the Senate bill that would set tougher
anti-pollution requirements than President Bush recommended. The
Senate standards also exceed what a pending House bill would
require.
   The disputed provisions ``would have a devastating impact on the
auto industry, its dealers, suppliers and employees, and perhaps
most importantly on the customers we serve,'' said Helen O.
Petrauskas, a Ford Motor Co. vice president and chairman of the
Engineering Policy Committee of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association.
   Represented at the news conference were the Big Three domestic
automakers plus Honda, Volkswagen, and the Automobile Importers of
America, which includes European and Asian manufacturers. A
spokesman for the National Automobile Dealers Association also
participated.
   Automakers have two primary objections to the Senate bill, on
which floor debate began this week:
   _The Bush, House and Senate bills envision a roughly 3wed to U.S. banks.
   ``Brazil cannot be relegated to the confinement and the
backwardness in which it is living today,'' Fernando Collor de
Mello told a news conference in Washington.
   He said the Brazilian people can not pay a high price for
solving the debt problem.
   ``We have to pursue economic growth as the sole way for
Brazilians to solve their internal problems, ending the social
injustice amd misery of millions of Brazilians who are hungry, that
live in poverty, totally without hope,'' he said. ``We cannnot
relinquish our economic growth.''
   He said he would use the strategy proposed for debt reduction by
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady or any other method of
negotiation. Brady's ideas have brought agreement between Mexico,
the Third World's second biggest debtor, and its creditor banks.
Though the amount of reduction for Mexico is expected to be small,
there will be a significant drop in the billions Mexico has been
paying out every year as interest.
   Collor de Mello said he had discussed the debt situation with
President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III, along
with environment and trade problems. He invited the heads of the
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Interamerican
Development Bank to dinner Friday night before continuing a
round-the-world trip.
   Brazil, the biggest and most populous country in Latin America,
has been struggling because of the debt problem. Inflation exceeds
1,700 percent a year, meaning that a given basket of goods will
cost 17 times as much next January.
   Illiteracy is following the same pattern, up to 27 percent in
1988 from 25 percent in 1986.
   Collor de Mello, a conservative, last month won Brazil's first
presidential election in 29 years, defeating leftist Luis Inacio
Lula da Silva by a narrow margin.

<TEXT>
   A project to illuminate the
Matterhorn seems headed for official rejection after citizens came
out strongly against it, officials said Friday.
   Engineer Herbert Schoettl had submitted to municipal authorities
a proposal to instal laser projectors on two glaciers that, he
said, would turn the famous mountain into a ``grandiose light
sculpture.''
   The project, according to Schoettl, would be an ``essential
contribution to the festivities planned next year to mark the 700th
anniversary'' of the Swiss Confederation.
   But it stirred little enthusiasm among Zermatters who argued
that sun, moon and stars suffice as sources of light for the
14,700-foot ``horu,'' or ``horn'' as the peak is called locally.
Ninety-nine percent of those present at a meeting Wednesday opposed
the idea, according to one resident.
   Mayor Daniel Lauber was described as confident the final word
from the communal council also would turn down the project.
   ``This would mean us inviting sensation tourism,'' a newspaper
quoted him as saying. ``We have no need for that.''

<TEXT>
   With a deafening burst of fireworks and the
gongs of an antique bell, Asians welcomed the Year of the Horse on
Saturday after jamming airports, ferry terminals and train stations
for the four-day getaway.
   Hong Kong's noisy street markets filled Friday with last-minute
shoppers purchasing food, flowers, nuts and candy from merchants
happily charging up to three times normal prices before the city
shut down for the holiday.
   Family feasts on the eve of the Lunar New Year traditionally
kick off the holiday, which for Chinese and Vietnamese is the most
important festival of the year. In China, the Lunar New Year is
known as the Spring Festival.
   The eve is the one day of the year Chinese police can drink
alcohol on the job, and officers in the Beijing Train Station, long
emptied of departing holiday travelers, toasted the holiday with
120-proof firewater during lunch.
   Fruits from temperate climates, such as oranges, bananas, and
even kiwi, were brought into the capital to ensure bountiful feasts.
   Each lunar year is represented by one of 12 animals of the
Chinese zodiacal calendar. The Year of the Snake gave way to the
Year of the Horse at midnight Friday.
   As the clock struck 12, Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong revived an
imperial tradition by striking the capital's 500-year-old bronze
bell _ China's largest and heaviest _ 12 times.
   Nearby, a worker and a soldier beat two large, red drums atop
Beijing's Drum Tower, but both the drums and the bell were drowned
out by a cacophony of firecrackers that continued unbroken for
about 15 minutes.
   In Taiwan, the new year was greeted with a barrage of
firecrackers. Hong Kong forbids firecrackers but put on a
spectacular fireworks display over its famed harbor.
   Buildings in the British colony were adorned with colorful New
Year's greetings, and tangerine trees, narcissus and other plants
considered auspicious adorned doorways.
   Hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong's 5.7 million people jammed
the airport, ferry terminals and the Chinese border crossing as
they left to visit relatives or take vacations.
   Most businesses closed Friday and will not reopen until Tuesday.
   The most popular New Year's greeting _ ``Kung Hei Fat Choy,''
which means congratulations and be prosperous _ will be repeated
countless times, and children will receive ``lai see'' _ red
packets stuffed with money.
   Hong Kong astrologer Andrew Yau predicted the coming year will
bring more rainfall, some instability, and rising gold prices.
   After fluctuating for the first half of the year ``the gold
price definitely will rise very much, perhaps more than 50
percent,'' Yau said.
   Both Yau and President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan predicted
political instability, but for different reasons. Yau cited a
complicated formula involving the Chinese calendar, while Lee
looked to the upheaval in Eastern Europe.
   ``Several Communist authoritarian regimes were overthrown in the
past year. We believe Chinese communists will face the same fate
soon,'' Lee said.
   He said that as ``long as Chinese Communists exist and Chinese
reunification problems remain unresolved, we will not enjoy real
stability and security.''
   Chinese Premier Li Peng and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin
were shown on television bringing holiday greetings to their nation
at midnight Friday. The unusual appearance was part of an annual
pre-recorded, four-hour New Year's Eve variety show, one of China's
most-watched television shows.
   The leaders traveled to the provinces during the week to bring
holiday greetings to workers and to thank soldiers for putting down
last spring's pro-democracy movement.
   During a six-day tour of Shanxi province, in northern China,
Jiang said socialism will triumph in China if ``we learn from
(their) spirit of fearing no hardship and quietly contributing to
the country and the people.''
   Such exhortations have been common in the wake of last year's
pro-democracy movement, which was violently crushed by the military.
   This year's Spring Festival celebrations in Beijing seemed more
subdued than past years, when the sound of firecrackers could be
heard all night long.
   Traditionally, Chinese set off firecrackers for almost any
special occasion but especially at the Lunar New Year because it is
supposed to ward off evil spirits.
   The official Xinhua news agency said Beijing's huge bell and
drums will be sounded on the eve of every Spring Festival from now
on. The Bell and Drum Towers were the timekeepers for imperial
Beijing, but until now, neither had been used for 66 years, since
the last emperor left the Imperial Palace.
   ``In the old society, that's how we knew the time,'' said a
60-year-old woman who lives near the towers.
   She said it was the first time she had heard the bell or the
drum since 1949, when the Communists took power.

   A man facing charges in
a 1985 Tokyo airport bombing that killed two baggage handlers will
stand trial in September, a judge ruled Friday.
   Inderjit Singh Reyat, 37, a former resident of Duncan on
Vancouver Island, was extradited from England in December. He faces
two manslaughter charges and five explosives charges.
   British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Howard Callaghan
scheduled the trial for Sept. 17 and said he will rule Feb. 9 on a
government motion to change the venue of the trial to surburban New
Westminster from Vancouver.
   Reyat's attorney, David Gibbons, has opposed the move, saying it
would make it difficult for his Vancouver office to support him.
   Gibbons said outside the court he has not applied for bail for
his client because he is still gathering evidence to support such
an application.
   The prosecution alleges Reyat bought materials similar to those
used in a bomb that was placed on a CP Air flight in Vancouver and
killed the baggage handlers when they unloaded luggage from the
plane at Narita airport.

   More than 500 United Mine Workers members
from three states marched two miles up an Appalachian hollow Friday
to demand the removal of non-union workers from a coal preparation
plant.
   Union coal miners chanting ``UMW all the way'' marched up Rum
Creek to a private bridge leading to the Rum Creek Coal Sales Inc.
plant, site of confrontations and arrests earlier this week.
   ``We're here to show solidarity in a peaceful manner and show
the community of Dehue that it needs a rabies vaccination to rid of
some bad dogs,'' said Roger Nelson, a UMW strike organizer.
   Miners struck Rum Creek in mid-August after the company
re-opened the coal preparation plant with non-union contractors.
UMW members men had run it before.
   It was the largest gathering of UMW miners since June, when a
rally in Charleston in support of miners on strike against the
Pittston Coal Group, attracted more than 1,000 people, the union
said. That march triggered wildcat strikes the next day, which
eventually idled 43,000 miners in 10 states.
   ``Our focus is to bring public attention and bring justice to
people in the coal fields,'' said Bob Phalen, president of UMW
District 17.
   Cars and pickups lined a state highway about 70 miles south of
Charleston, and state police escorted the miners, from West
Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky, two miles from a parking lot to
the coal company bridge.
   No violence was reported. Rum Creek officials told U.S. marshals
at the site that no coal trucks would make runs Friday. Marshals
were present because the UMW is under court order not to block
access to the coal company property.
   ``The continued presence of federal marshals and state police
has helped contain UMWA violence at Rum Creek,'' said Deborah
Herndon, a spokesman for A.T. Massey Coal Co., Rum Creek's parent
company.
   Many miners said they were prepared to be arrested.
   ``If that's what they want us to do, we'll do it. It's one for
all and all for one in the United Mine Workers,'' said Bill
Humphrey of Whitesville, who carried a framed copy of the
Declaration of Independence.
   Humphrey works at New Beckley Coal Co., where the UMW has been
on strike for nearly a year. About 100 of his co-workers also
attended the rally.
   ``I get emotional over stuff like this,'' said Bill Ingram, a
40-year veteran of the Rum Creek plant.
   Pickets have blocked the coal company road with cars and trucks.
On Monday and Tuesday, coal trucks plowed the vehicles out of the
way. On Wednesday, federal marshals had them towed away.
   Two UMW members were arraigned Thursday in Charleston on charges
of assaulting federal marshals Wednesday and freed on $25,000
secured bonds. A third UMW member was freed on $10,000 unsecured
bond after being charged with violating the court order.

   Justice William J. Brennan, the leading
liberal member of an increasingly conservative Supreme Court, said
Friday that dissenting from court rulings is not ``an egoistic
act'' but a duty.
   In a speech to the New York State Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers, Brennan said, ``Where significant and deeply held
disagreement exists, members of the court have a responsibility to
articulate it.''
   A copy of the speech was made available here.
   ``I do not mean to suggest that one has a duty or right simply
to make noise,'' Brennan said. ``What I am saying is that all of us
_ judges, lawyers, students, teachers, factory workers, bankers _
must recognize values which are so important to us that we cannot
remain silent if and when we feel those values threatened.''
   The justice added, ``The right to dissent is one of the great
and cherished freedoms that we enjoy by virtue of the excellent
accident of our birth as Americans.
   For a dissenting judge, Brennan said, ``Writing is not an
egoistic act _ it is duty. Saying, `Listen to me, see it my way,
change your mind,' is not self-indulgence _ it is hard work that we
are not permitted to shirk,'' he said.
   He noted that dissents can strain collegiality and sometimes
bruise feelings.
   Brennan, 83, is the high court's senior member. He was appointed
by President Eisenhower in 1956 and soon thereafter became a key
architect of a liberal court under Chief Justice Earl Warren.
   ``I'm sure it has not escaped your attention that these days I
am often a dissenter,'' Brennan said. ``How different that is from
20 or 25 years ago. In some terms during the 1960s I was in the
majority in all but one or two cases.''
   He discussed the various roles of dissents:
   _To offer a corrective, ``in the hope that the court will mend
the error of its ways in a later case.''
   ``This function reflects the conviction that the best way to
find the truth is to go looking for it in the marketplace of
ideas,'' Brennan said. ``It is as if the opinions of the court _
both for the majority and the dissent _ were the product of a
judicial town meeting.''
   _To emphasize the limits of the majority decision, ``a sort of
damage-control mechanism.''
   _To express the conscience of the individual justice, a category
Brennan called ``the most enduring dissents.''
   ``These are the dissents that ... seek to sow seeds for future
harvest. These are the dissents that soar with passion and ring
with rhetoric. These are the dissents that, at their best, straddle
the worlds of literature and law,'' he said.
   The justice said the tradition of issuing dissenting opinions
began early in the Supreme Court's history, in 1805.

<HEAD>Four-Month Hunger Strike Called Off</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man serving life in prison for the attempted
assassination of an Iranian exile leader decided Friday to call off
his 19-week hunger strike, the Justice Ministry said.
   Anis Naccache told officials at Fresnes Prison of his decision
to end his fast without giving any explanation, the ministry said.
   Naccache, a native of Beirut, contends that France promised to
free him in the deal that won the release in May 1988 of all French
hostages then held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
   On Sept. 8, he began refusing food to try to force the
government to let him go. He continued to drink liquids, and
doctors in the prison hospital fed him intravenously on occasion,
which they said could keep him alive indefinitely despite the
hunger strike.
   Naccache, 38, and four other men were sentenced to life in
prison for a July 1980 attack on Shahpour Bakhtiar, Iran's last
prime minister before the 1979 Islamic revolution. Bakhtiar escaped
injury but a policeman and a bystander were killed.
   Both defense lawyers and the prosecution said Naccache was the
leader of a team ordered by top Iranian leaders to kill Bakhtiar.
   Iran's current leaders, while not confirming they ordered the
assassination, have supported Naccache's claim that France promised
to free him during the 1988 hos5 pounds.
   There were fears that if he died, French targets would again be
hit by terrorist bombs.
   Naccache was one of three prisoners whose freedom was demanded
by a group calling itself the Committee for Solidarity with Arab
and Middle East Political Prisoners, which claimed responsibility
for bombings in 1985 and 1986 that killed 13 people and injured
more than 250 in Paris.
   The criminal trial is scheduled to open Monday for 10 people
charged in those bombings.

<TEXT>
   President Bush told Brazilian President-elect
Fernando Collor de Mello on Friday he wants to work with Brazil on
environmental problems and revitalizing its economy, the White
House said.
   Collar de Mello refused to comment on Bush's invasion of Panama
when asked during a photo session, but at a press conference later,
he reiterated Brazil's opposiion to the Dec. 20 military action.
   ``The only intervention we approve is the intervention of
reason,'' he told reporters.
   Environmentalists' concerns about Brazil center on the
destruction of the rain forests there, with increasing development
encroaching on thousands of acres of the ecologically important
forests.
   The topic is a sensitive one, however, because Brazilians say
their ailing economy benefits from the development. Destruction of
the trees is believed to worsen the global warming trend.
   Suggestions have been raised that debt relief for Brazil be tied
to resolution of the rain-forest situation.
   ``The president reviewed our own efforts to address
environmental problems in the United States and expressed a desire
to work with Brazil and other countries so that a proper balance
can be worked out between development and environmental concerns,
with full respect for every nation's sovereignty and with the need
to base deliberations on the best scientific data available,'' the
White House said.
   At his news conference, Collor de Mello said his government is
aware of the environmental concerns, but added that any actions
Brasilia decides to take will be because the government feels it is
in the best interest of Brazil, not because of outside pressure.
   Brazil's Amazon jungle contains 30 percent of the world's rain
forests. Satellite photos have shown cattle ranchers and miners
each year destroy an area the size of Belgium.
   Collor de Mello is on a get-acquainted trip to the United
States, Japan, Europe an the Soviet Union to talk with world
leaders before his March 11 inauguration.
   The White House said he and Bush discussed a range of issues
including trade, investment, debt, and the environment.
   ``The president expressed strong support for president-elect
Collor's plans to reform and revitalize Brazil's economy and stated
that the Uited States would work closely with Brazil toward this
goal.''
   Brazil has a $115 billion foreign debt, the largest in the
developing world.
   Collor de Mello, a conservative, free-market advocate, was
elected last Dec. 18, defeating a socialist opponent. It was the
first direct presidential election in Brazil in 29 years.
   Collor de Mello also met with Vice President Dan Quayle, who was
leaving later in the day for a trip to Honduras, Panama and
Jamaica. Quayle was to talk to several Latin leaders about the U.S.
invasion of Panama and explain Bush's rationale in the face of
Latin resentment about that action.

<HEAD>100 Feet in 10 Seconds Equal How Many Slices of Bread?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The problem, as posed to 150,000 school
children on Friday, was this:
   A student, running 100 feet every 10 seconds, 24 hours a day,
requires 1,467 days to reach the moon. He or she burns 864 calories
an hour. A slice of bread contains 60 calories. How high would the
loaf of bread have to be to supply the student with enough energy
to reach the moon?
   Okay, okay. Something is left out of the problem. A sandwich
slice is about one-half inch thick. The answer is, 30,419,712
calories are represented in 506,995 slices of bread which stacked
would be 253,498 inches high, creating a loaf of bread four miles
high.
   Oh, yes. The moon averages about 240,000 miles away, though you
didn't have to know that to solve the problem.
   This problem was one of five presented on a satellite network
connecting 900 schools around the country to spark youngsters'
interest in learning and to spur appreciation science, math, and
teaching.
   It was the first of such classroom lessons sponsored by the
Challenger Center, an educational project founded by the families
of the seven astronauts who perished aboard the space shuttle
Challenger four years ago.
   ``Today, we took you on an imaginary trip to the moon,'' said
Dr. R. Lynn Bondurant Jr., chief of educational services at NASA's
Lewis Research Center who conducted the program. ``Some day you may
be on a real trip to the moon ... Remember to reach for the stars.''
   Teachers in the participating classes received matterials in
advance. The preparation showed as pupils afterward asked questions
of Michael Collins, who flew the mother ship while astronauts Neil
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made the walk on the moon in 1969.
   What impresses you most from that far away from home?
   ``The size of the Earth,'' said Collins. ``First you have to
find it. It is as small as your thumbnail.''
   What supplies should you take?
   ``Hydrogen,'' said Collins. Human beings need water, which is
two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen. ``You can get a lot of
oxygen out of the rocks on the moon, but you have to take hydrogen
from Earth.''
   How long will the footprints left on the moon last?
   ``I don't know,'' said Collins. Eventually, he said, they would
be obliterated by micrometeorites hitting the moon.
   Friday's lessons included calculations to find the distance to
the moon, evaluating the differences in gravity, mapping the moon,
and the Collins interview.
   In the next few weeks the student will work on designing a lunar
mining base and one plan from each school will be submitted to the
Challenger center.
   For the gravity calculations, the students were shown a clip in
which astronaut David Scott, on Apollo 15, dropped a hammer and
feather simultaneously to the moon and they hit the surface at
exactly the same time.
   What they weren't asked to calculate was one of the space age's
most enduring mysteries. How far did the golf ball that Alan
Shepard hit on the moon during the Apollo 14 mission travel in the
one-sixth gravity and no atmosphere to slow it down?

<HEAD>Federal Judge Delays IRS Auction Of Comedian's Property</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge on Friday delayed an
Internal Revenue Service auction of property belonging to comedian
Redd Foxx, just 24 hours before the sale was to begin.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Clive Jones issued a 30-day stay
despite protests by IRS attorneys and the auctioneer involved.
   Foxx's attorney, Paul Whitford, told the court that the sale
would conflict with the interests of the bankruptcy court. Whitford
said the issue was ``whether provisions of the bankruptcy code
override provisions of the IRS code.''
   Foxx, who filed for Chapter 11 protection from bankruptcy in
1983, owes the IRS $900,000 in back taxes, penalties and interest.
He was not at the hearing.
   Foxx gained his widest audience as a junk dealer on the 1972-77
TV series ``Sanford and Son.''
   The IRS seized more than 400 items of personal property Nov. 28.
The property ranged from his Las Vegas home to antique cars,
furniture, dozens of pieces of flashy jewelry, posters and
photographs.
   Auctioneer Robert Deiro pleaded with the court to let the action
proceed, saying ``hundreds of people are descending on the city''
from as far away as Asia to attend the sale.
   Jones said another hearing would be scheduled next month to
review the issue of whether the court or the IRS has jurisdiction
over the property.
   Deiro said Foxx would suffer if the auction is delayed because
many of those who planned to attend Saturday's sale would lose
interest and not return later.
   ``I feel Mr. Foxx has shot himself in the foot,'' Deiro said.
   Deiro predicted the sale would ``go a long ways toward retiring
the debt Mr. Foxx owes the taxpayers of the United States.''
   Deiro said a public showing of the sale items was already under
way while the hearing was being conducted, and estimated his
company had spent $20,000 promoting the sale.
   Jones also ordered Foxx to turn over a watch which the IRS
believes the comic still has in his possession. The watch was given
to him by the late Elvis Presley and was represented as being worth
``the high six figures,'' according to IRS attorney Rollin Thorley.
   Jones said if Foxx didn't turn over the watch by Tuesday, he
would consider lifting the 30-day stay.

   An autopsy was planned on the bodies of John and Barbara Hartman

death, an Embassy spokesman said. Foul play was not suspected.
   The couple appeared to have been dead for some time before their

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has ordered that
about 250 jobs be cut over the next three fiscal years from the
staff that supports the Pentagon's civilian leadership, the Defense
Department announced on Friday.
   The reduction in the staff, formally known as the Office of the
Secretary of Defense, will be taken in three separate reductions in
fiscal years 1991, 1992 and 1993, the department said in a
statement.
   Simliar cuts have been ordered in the money allocated for
outside contract services, the statement said.
   The reductions are designed to comply with the secretary's
efforts to streamline the Pentagon bureaucracy as called for under
his defense management review.
   ``With tight budgets, every element of the department's work
force must pass the same test of necessity and efficiency. My staff
has to make the grade, just like everybody else,'' Cheney said in
the statement.
   The statement did not say exactly how the cuts would be
achieved, but Pentagon spokesman Army Maj. David Super said
officials expect normal attrition to help in the reductions.

   The public interest group Citizen Action on
Friday announced a nationwide campaign to push for passage of a
comprehensive national health care program.
   The current system is too expensive, inefficient, wasteful and
does not provide routine access to medical care for everyone,
Citizen Action leaders said at a news conference.
   ``We reallly can't wait any longer to push for a solution to our
health care crisis,'' said Robert M. Brandon, vice president and
political director of Citizen Action.
   ``The current system is bankrupting American families, hurting
American businesses and threatening the very health of our whole
economy,'' he said.
   Last year, Americans spent an estimated $600 billion on health
care, about 11 percent of the nation's gross national product, the
group said.
   Yet, an estimated 37 million people have no health insurance.
One of the consequences of this statistic, the group said, is that
the nation's infant mortality rate ranks 22nd in the world.
   The group wants to see a system along the lines of the one in
Canada, which is funded by taxpayers but still allows patients to
choose their own doctors and hospitals.
   Brandon said the group's 2 million members in 27 states will
organize a grassroots effort that, among other things, will work
for state-level passage of universal health care plans. Proposals
are being discussed in nearly 20 state legislatures, he said.

   Police sought clues from overseas Friday in the
execution-style slaying of an Israeli businessman allegedly tied to
mercenaries who trained Colombian drug cartel gunmen.
   Arik Afek, 39, was shot to death and stuffed into the trunk of a
car, the Dade County medical examiner's office said. The body was
found in a Miami International Airport parking garage after a
passer-by reported a foul smell.
   ``Homicide is keeping mum about the whole thing,'' said police
spokesman George Reyes. ``Apparently this is kind of baffling for
them.
   ``They're still collecting information,'' Reyes said. ``They're
getting calls from overseas, from folks in Israel.''
   Afek was wanted by Colombian authorities who accused him of
helping an Israeli who allegedly trained the guards of drug lords.
   He was interviewed recently by U.S. Secret Service Agents, said
a U.S. official in Washington who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The agents, preparing for President Bush's visit to Colombia for
a drug summit next month, have been inquiring into whether
Colombia's Medellin drug cartel has access to anti-aircraft
missiles or other weapons.
   Miami police investigators Friday were interviewing Afek's
friends and relatives, but hadn't taken anyone into custody, said
police spokeswoman Lucy Fitts. She didn't have any information on
who owned the beige Buick Regal that contained Afek's body.
   The medical examiner's office released a statement saying Afek
died of ``multiple gunshot wounds,'' but didn't reveal where he was
shot or when.
   Police said Afek had been dead several days when his body was
discovered Wednesday morning. His wallet was missing, and he wasn't
wearing jewelry. He was lying on his back, wearing shorts and a
casual shirt.
   Afek had been working in Miami as an officer in a business that
imports flowers from Colombia.
   In September, Colombian authorities issued warrants for Afek and
reserve Israeli army Lt. Col. Yair Klein. Afek was accused of
helping Klein escape from Colombia amid reports he was training
gunmen for the Medellin and Cali drug cartels.
   Klein later said he thought he was training farmers to fight
guerrillas.
   At the time, Diva Rojas, a spokeswoman for Colombia's Department
of Security, identified Afek as a civilian who had an arms business
in Israel and flower shops in the United States.
   Israeli television said Thursday that Afek was being
investigated by the CIA, which had given him a U.S. passport in
return for information on Israeli activity in Colombia.
   CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said Friday he could neither
confirm nor deny the report.
   The Miami Herald, quoting unidentified federal sources, said
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service investigators
discovered Afek made nearly daily calls to the Israeli National
Police office at the Israeli consulate in New York and well as
frequent calls to a woman at the Colombian Embassy in Washington.
   He had been under investigation since December because he was
admitted to the U.S. under a ``special agricultural worker''
program open only to foreign-born farm hands and fruit pickers, the
newspaper said.

   Gov. William A. O'Neill disclosed Friday
that he had had two benign polyps removed from his colon this week.
The governor said his doctors have told him he's fine.
   O'Neill, 59, has been plagued by colon polyps for more than a
year. Of two removed previously, one was cancerous.
   O'Neill made the disclosure during a taping of the ``On The
Record'' program on Connecticut Public Television.
   ``I went to the hospital Monday, I had a check and two minor
polyps were removed,'' O'Neill said. ``They were benign,
non-cancerous, quite normal, quite natural, according to my own
doctors.
   ``I feel fine, I really do, physically fine and mentally
alert,'' O'Neill said.
   O'Neill has repeatedly said he will run for a third full term
this year unless a health problem develops. He indicated during the
interview that this latest development wouldn't change his plans.
   ``I just don't see anything at the present time that's going to
curtail me running,'' O'Neill said.

   A television crew and several transients
helped a homeless mother give birth in MacArthur Park, an
inner-city park where drug deals are commonplace, authorities said.
   Eugenia Marin, who had been living in the park since September,
delivered a 5-pound, 4{-ounce girl Thursday morning, said fire
Inspector Ed Reed. Mother and baby were later listed in good
condition at a hospital.
   ``There were homeless people around her and one was holding the
child, still attached by the umbilical cord,'' Reed said. ``The
baby was cold and dirty.''
   Employees of Newsreel Video Service, a free-lance television
news crew, arrived shortly before paramedics after hearing a call
for medical aid on a police scanner. Crew members trained their
camera lights on the 21-year-old mother as she gave birth about
3:45 a.m. They also took pictures.
   Gary Arnote, Newsreel Video owner, said his crew's lights have
helped police out during accidents, but it's the first time they've
been used during a child's birth.
   ``It really makes you feel good when you get a story like
that,'' he said. ``We tape anything that is unusual, and a birth at
the park, well, that's unusual.''

<HEAD>More Snow And Rain In Northwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A windy storm blew snow and rain across parts of the Northwest
on Friday, and rain and snow also were scattered over the Northeast.
   At midday, snow showers extended over south-central and western
Montana, Western Wyoming, northern Nevada, the mountains of
northern California and southern Oregon, and west-central
Washington state.
   To the south, rain showers reached across northwestern Oregon
and along the northern coast of California.
   Up to 3 inches of snow fell overnight and during the morning at
Jackson Hole, Wyo., and as much as 8 inches of snow fell in the
Tetons and Absaroka mountains of northwestern Wyoming.
   Winter storm warnings were posted into Saturday over the
Washington Cascades and Olympics.
   A high wind warning was in effect through Saturday over the
eastern foothills of Colorado, where gusts reached 90 mph Friday
morning at Rollinsville.
   Rain fell over much of New England, southeastern New York state
and New Jersey. Snow extended from west-central New England across
southern New York state, northern and western Pennsylvania and
northeastern Ohio. Rain over southern Maine changed to snow by
early afternoon.
   Three inches of snow fell at Binghamton, N.Y., during the 6
hours up to noon.
   Heavy rain overnight across northeastern New York state caused
rapid melting of snow cover and flood warnings were in effect over
the Hudson Valley in northeastern New York state and southern
Vermont.
   Elsewhere, snow showers were scattered across southeastern Lower
Michigan, eastern Upper Michigan and northeastern Minnesota.
   In the wake of Thursday's storm that socked Michigan, foul
weather and hazardous driving conditions Friday forced schools
across the northern Lower Peninsula to close, giving students
plenty of time to help their families dig out from under up to 15
inches of snow.
   At least 120 school districts in northern Lower Michigan and the
eastern Upper Peninsula closed Friday. Classes had ended early in
some districts Thursday to give buses extra time to negotiate
snow-covered back roads.
   ``It was a particularly wet and heavy snow. It made the roads
pretty slippery. Out in the patrol car, the wheels kept spinning
when I didn't want them to. A lot of people ended up in the
ditches,'' said Sgt. Mike Gillette of the Ogemaw County Sheriff's
Office.
   Toppled trees and branches tore down power lines, knocking out
power to about 44,000 Detroit Edison Co. customers. By midday
Friday, electricity was restored to all but 12,500 customers, most
of them in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties, spokesman Bob Dobkin
said.
   Consumers Power Co. reported 40,379 customers lost power in the
storm, most in the Kalamazoo and Lansing areas. By midday Friday,
7,640 were without power, spokesman Bob Goodwin said.
   Jamestown, N.D., had a record high Friday of 51 degrees.
   Friday's low for the Lower 48 states was 9 degrees below zero at
Hibbing and International Falls, Minn.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 22
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 73 at San Diego and Wink, Texas.

<HEAD>Bush Unveils Head Start Funds Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush proposed a $500-million
spending increase Friday for the Head Start program for low-income
children, saying every youngster ``deserves the opportunity for a
full and happy life.''
   The proposal, which will be included in the 1991 budget he
unveils Monday, is a step toward Bush's campaign pledge to expand
Head Start to reach all eligible four-year-olds.
   Bush said the new funds would permit Head Start's enrollment to
grow to 667,000 children, or 70 percent of those eligible. It now
enrolls 39 percent.
   ``I urge the Congress to fund our Head Start proposal in full,
because every American child with special needs _ whether physical,
emotional or material _ deserves the opportunity for a full and
happy life,'' Bush said.
   Head Start programs emphasize social and learning skills
necessary to succeed in school. It serves pre-school, low-income
children, usually in the year before the enter school.
   The 1,300 local Head Start programs also provide breakfast and
lunch and screen children for medical or dental problems. Analysts
of both parties and widely diverging political views consider Head
Start the most successful of all the government's educational aid
programs.
   Bush's proposal would increase Head Start spending to $1.9
billion.
   ``I think a $500-million increase is quite remarkable,'' said
Louis Sullivan, secretary of health and human services.
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education
and Labor Committee, and The Committee for Education Funding, an
advocacy group, have called for Head Start appropriations of $5
billion a year.
   Bush announced his proposal at a ``celebration of children
ceremony'' in the East Room where he also underscored his support
for adoptions, which he has promoted as an alternative to abortion.
   Bush, who has two grandchildren who are adopted, said,
``Adoption is good for America, for the children who need a loving
home, for the birth parents who want the best for their children,
and for the adoptive parents by giving them the joy of raising and
loving a child.''
   About 100 ``special needs'' children _ those hard to adopt
because of handicaps or because of their age _ attended the
ceremony, playing and moving around as Bush spoke.
   ``This has got to be the most unique event ever held in the
White House, I think _ like a fishpond moving around,'' he said.
   Bush interrupted his speech when a child standing in front of
him wailed for a bathroom. ``This guy's got to go real bad, doesn't
he? '' Bush said.
   A man who appeared to be the boy's father rushed over to collect
him, and Bush said, ``That's okay, we're used to that around
here.'' Consoling the child, Bush said, ``That's okay, big guy.''

annual income under $160 a person, Bangladesh is one of the largest
and poorest of the group.
   Ershad's Washington schedule includes meetings with Secretary of
State James Baker III, World Bank President Barber Conable and
members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign
Affairs Committee.
   The Bangladesh Embassy said Ershad would call on meet President
Francois Mitterand in France after his departure from the United

   A former Sperry Corp. marketing executive who
admitted initiating a scheme to bribe a Navy procurement official
was sentenced Friday to 60 days in a halfway house.
   Frank J. Lavelle, 69, of Dunedin, Fla., was sentenced in U.S.
District Court in Alexandria, Va., on his guilty plea to conspiracy
to defraud the government and commit bribery of a public official.
   U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton gave Lavelle a two-year
sentence, then suspended all but 60 days of the term and ordered
the defendant to serve that period in a halfway house.
   Lavelle, former marketing director of Sperry Corp.'s Clearwater,
Fla., facility, could have received a 20-year prison term for
initiating the scheme to bribe Navy procurement officer Garland L.
Tomlin Jr.
   Lavelle, who pleaded guilty Oct. 20, has agreed to cooperate
with the Justice Department's investigation of Pentagon procurement
fraud codenamed ``Operation Ill Wind.''
   Lavelle admitted that he introduced Tomlin to Sperry Corp. vice
president Charles F. Gardner, telling Gardner that Tomlin wanted a
``nest egg'' for his retirement.
   Tomlin has pleaded guilty to accepting $400,000 in bribes from
Sperry, which later merged with Burroughs Corp. to become Unisys
Corp., and $75,000 from Honeywell Inc. in exchange for confidential
bid information.
   Gardner, 59, once vice president of Sperry's surveillance and
fire-control systems unit, received a 32-month prison term for his
involvement in a separate bribery scheme.
   Both Tomlin and Gardner are cooperating with the Ill Wind probe.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Friday barred the State
Department from evicting Lebanon's deposed ambassasdor from the
Lebanese Embassy.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene issued a temporary
restraining order pending his final ruling, expected within 10
days. Greene was acting on a motion filed by Lebanese Christian
Gen. Michel Aoun and his ambassador to Washington, Abdallah
Bouhabib.
   The State Department argued that Bouhabib should be removed from
the embassy because the United States does not recognize Aoun as
Lebanon's legitimate ruler. The United States has extended
recognition to Aoun's rival, President Elias Hrawi, who was elected
in November by Lebanon's parliament.
   Greene said the State Department failed to consider that Aoun
provides protection for the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon, located in an
area controlled by his forces. U.S. diplomats have left Lebanon,
but Lebanese employees continue to work there.
   Greene indicated that his final ruling might favor the State
Department, but he criticized the United States for not giving
Bouhabib sufficient notice of the intention to evict him.
   The State Department received a request Wednesday from the
pro-Syrian Hrawi government to evict Bouhabib so that a new
Lebanese ambassador could occupy the embassy and adjacent residence.
   The Hrawi government representative, appointed earlier this
month, is working out of temporary offices.
   Greene said that while he could not interfere with the U.S.
decision to recognize Hrawi, he rejected the State Department's
argument that Bouhabib had committed an ``intrusion or forcible
entry'' into the embassy. Bouhabib has been Lebanon's ambassador
since 1983. The Hrawi government removed Bouhabib from his job in
December.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Standish argued that his removal
from office served as Bouhabib's notice of eviction from the
embassy. Greene disputed that, saying that ``those in possession''
of premises ``are entitled to reasonable notice and process under
U.S. law.'' A 30-day notice was appropriate, he said.
   Bouhabib, who has lived in Washington for 20 years, has refused
to leave the embassy and the residence, locking out most employees.
He controls the embassy's bank accounts, its files and diplomatic
cyphers.
   Greene said the court ``has the duty to prevent the forcible
turning over of archives to a rival regime'' at least until
sensitive material can be removed.

<TEXT>
   Attorneys who were ``callous'' toward
grieving families are the subject of a grand jury investigation
into alleged illegal lawsuit promotion following the deaths of 21
students in a school bus wreck.
   Seven lawyers and several ``runners'' soliciting business for
them are the focus of the investigation, said Hidalgo County
District Attorney Rene Guerra.
   ``Some of these people were being solicited at the wakes, which
is pretty callous,'' Guerra said.
   It is illegal in Texas for lawyers or their representatives to
solicit business from victims or their families. The crime,
commonly known as ``ambulance chasing,'' is called barratry.
   The grand jury finished its first full day of inquiry Thursday,
and will meet again Wednesday, Guerra said. It could take three
weeks for the grand jury to decide about indictments, he said.
   In November, Guerra said he was investigating 18 attorneys in
connection with the Sept. 21, 1989, accident. But he said Thursday
there was not enough evidence to present some of those cases to the
grand jury.
   The junior and senior high students died when a soft drink truck
ran a stop sign and hit their bus, knocking it into a water-filled
pit in the southern Texas town of Alton.
   Guerra was not specific about where the lawyers under
investigation were from, saying only that some came from outside
the Lower Rio Grande Valley.
   Barratry in Texas is a misdemeanor on the first offense,
punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $2,000; and
a third-degree felony on the second offense, under certain
circumstances, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $5,000
fine.
   Those convicted also could face sanctions from the State Bar of
Texas, including possible disbarment.
   Lawsuits that potentially could run into tens of millions of
dollars have been filed in the case, principally against
McAllen-based Valley Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Inc., owner of the
truck. The truck driver is set for trial in March on 21 counts of
involuntary manslaughter.

<HEAD>Yazov Says Military Task Was to Prevent Seizure of Power</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to include report of Azerbaijan-Armenian
meeting; picks up 7th `The defense'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Red Army went into Baku a week ago to stop the
Azerbaijani People's Front and other groups from seizing power,
Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov said in remarks published Friday.
   He told Soviet journalists in Baku, capital of the Azerbaijan
republic, that on Jan. 20 _ the day after soldiers took over the
city _ ``a meeting was planned at which it was proposed to declare
the transfer of power into the hands of the People's Front.''
   Baltic activists said Friday that Azerbaijani representatives
had agreed to visit Riga, capital of Latvia, next week for possible
talks with an Armenian delegation on resolving ethnic strife that
caused the military intervention.
   Opposition members of the Soviet parliament and an official
newspaper questioned the Kremlin's use of force in the Caucasus to
quell the ethnic violence that began Jan. 13.
   Yazov said the People's Front declared its own state of
emergency in Baku a full day before the soldiers moved in, and ``in
many regions of the city ... Soviet and party organs had ceased to
control the situation.''
   In the remarks published by the government newspaper Izvestia,
Yazov appeared to stress the need to control the political
situation over stopping ethnic warfare in which dozens of people
were killed.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other top officials have
cited public safety as the reason for the military assault and
ensuing battle with nationalists in which at least 80 people died.
   The defense minister said the military's task now was to destroy
the power structure the People's Front and other informal political
organizations had established in state-run institutions.
   Critics of the military move against well-armed Azerbaijani
nationalists have said attacks on the Armenian minority had ended
well before the army moved. Azerbaijani nationalists have accused
Moscow of seeking to crush their movement against the Communist
Party and government apparatus.
   Yazov said 80 ``extremists'' from the People's Front and other
informal organizations had been arrested.
   Baku journalist Tuuzala Kasumova said by telephone that, after
meeting with Azerbaijani deputies, Yazov had pulled some tanks and
other military equipment off the streets of Baku and the city was
less tense.
   Yazov said: ``The army's actions are directed at breathing new
life into Baku's fading economy, confiscating weapons from the
population and destroying the organizational structure of the
People's Front leaders who are keen on seizing power.
   ``According to our estimates, about 40,000 militants armed with
submachine guns, rifles of various systems, machine guns and
shotguns are loose in Azerbaijan.''
   Yuri N. Afanasyev, a member of the Congress of People's Deputies
was one of the opposition figures who requested an emergency
parliament session to settle the Caucasus dispute.
   ``From our point of view, we should have a Supreme Soviet
session to hear all groups, to regulate the conflict,'' he said at
a Moscow news conference.
   ``We need to call a session so that the threat of the south does
not touch all of society,'' he said.
   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet has the power to call the
Supreme Soviet into session. A regular session of the Supreme
Soviet is scheduled for mid-February.
   Although Gorbachev's reforms have opened up Soviet society,
Afanasyev likened the decision to send soldiers into Baku to the
secret decisions to crush democracy movements in Hungary and
Czechoslovakia and send troops to Afghanistan.
   He and 12 other legislators signed a document urging a special
session of the Supreme Soviet to discuss redrawing the border
between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have been locked in a
territorial dispute for two years, and a deadline for withdrawning
the soldiers in Baku. They said they were ``categorically against
the use of force.''
   Afanasyev is a leader of the Inter-regional Deputies Group, the
formal parliamentary opposition that claims about 400 members and
was created largely through the inspiration of Andrei Sakharov, the
late human rights activist.
   The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said two veterans of the
Afghanistan war, Cols. A. Savelyev and A. Rusakov, sent a telegram
to Gorbachev Jan. 19 that said bringing in troops would lead ``to a
total break in relations and put their families in danger,'' as
well as ``creating a rise in the anti-Russian mood.''
   Since then, thousands of relatives of Soviet soldiers have been
evacuated from Baku and there have been reports of threats and
attacks against Russians in the Azerbaijani capital.
   Bringing Russian families into the conflict could spread unrest
far across the Soviet Union. Despite having their own republics,
Armenians and Azerbaijanis live together with Russians in many
parts of the country.
   Military commandant Lt. Gen. Vladimir Dubinyak said Baku was
``relatively calm,'' early Friday, Tass reported. In the previous
24 hours, 147 people had been detained in Baku either for breaking
curfew or other violations, Tass said.
   Two newspapers were banned by the military authorities.
   The agency said troops had not used weapons Thursday, but
Komsomolskaya Pravda reported two people were killed when an
armored personnel carrier ran over a car.
   In Moscow, Azerbaijani activists said commandos in bullet-proof
vests and helmets raided the republic's mission and arrested a
nationalist leader. A Moscow police official confirmed the raid and
said it was being investigated.
   Azerbaijan journalist Shain Hadjiev said commandos charged into
the government mission at 3 a.m., searched it and herded about 40
men into buses.
   But he said all were released except Ekhtibar Mamedov, who has
gained attention recently by pushing Azerbaijani claims that there
were far more people killed in the troop assault on Baku than the
official death toll.

   Scattered strikes were reported in
restive Kosovo province Friday in response to a call for a general
walkout, and police intervened to stop crowds of ethnic Albanians
from demonstrating.
   State television said protesters ``shot with guns in the
direction'' of police in Pec, 30 miles west of Pristina, the
provincial capital. The report could not be confirmed and did not
say whether anyone was injured.
   Tanjug, the official news agency, said strikes occurred at 20
companies, including at the Stari Trg mine near Titova Mitrovica,
25 miles north of Pristina, and at the Trepca mine near the
capital. It did not say how many workers were involved.
   ``Swift police actions'' prevented hundreds of ethnic Albanians
from protesting in Titova Mitrovica, Podujevo and several other
Kosovo towns, Tanjug said.
   Turmoil began in Kosovo, an impoverished southern province
adjacent to Albania, after constitutional changes last year limited
its autonomy and gave more control to Serbia, of which it is a
part. At least 28 people were killed.
   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians, who make up about 90 percent of
Kosovo's 1.9 million people, were jailed in a police crackdown that
followed. A partial state of emergency remains in force.
   Strikes and protests at the Stari Trg and Trepca mines in
January led to the arrest of Azem Vlasi, former Communist Party
chief in Kosovo, on charges of ``anti-revolutionary activity.'' He
is being tried and could face death if convicted.
   Protesters in Kosovo demand an end to alleged discrimination and
free elections in the province.
   An independent Kosovo human rights group issued a statement
Friday protesting what it termed ``brutal police action against
innocent citizens'' who demonstrated peacefully in Pristina on
Wednesday.
   The Committee for the Protection of Human Rights also demanded
free elections, an end to the state of emergency and the release of
hundreds of political prisoners.
   Up to 100 riot police guarded the Communist Party headquarters
in Pristina on Friday and 500 Pristina University students gathered
outside their dormitories, under the eyes of other security
personnel.
   ``We want our legal rights, like all other people in
Yugoslavia,'' said a student, who refused to give his name. ``We
want a change of leadership, the release of all political prisoners
and free elections.''
   On Wednesday, police used a water cannon to disperse 40,000
ethnic Albanians demonstrating in front of party headquarters.
   The student who spoke to journalists said the Democratic
Alliance of Kosovo, a new political movement, represented the
interests of all people in Kosovo, both the majority Albanians and
minority Serbs.
   Democratic Alliance leader Ibrahim Rugova claimed Friday that
more than 100,000 people had joined in the past month.
   He said the group, which authorities have called hostile and
separatist, had applied for official registration and expected a
reply by next week.
   Rugova said the alliance was cooperating with other movements
promoting human rights in the region.
   International human rights groups and media in Yugoslavia's
liberal northern republics of Slovenia and Croatia have claimed
human rights violations are common in Kosovo.

   The government on Friday announced the recall

propellant used in the product may be highly flammable.
   The product, ``Extra Thick Super String,'' often used at
children's birthday parties and other celebrations, is hazardous if
sprayed near an open flame, said the Consumer Product Safety
Commission.
   The commission received consumer hotline reports of six children
who were burned when fires started after the string was sprayed in
the area of birthday cakes with candles, said CPSC spokesman Ken
Giles.
   Approximately three million cans of the string were sold
nationwide from December 1988 until October 1989, when the New
Jersey-based manufacturer, E. Davis, Inc., developed a new
inflammable propellant formula, the agency said in a written
statement.
   Consumers should discard any pre-October cans of the product and
mail the each orange, blue, pink or green plastic can cap to the
company for two replacements with the reformulated items.

   A grandson and namesake of Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles said Friday he is dismayed by a proposal to
rename Washington Dulles International Airport for Dwight D.
Eisenhower.
   Backers of the name change, however, said they still think it is
a good idea, especially since ``Dulles'' often can sound like
``Dallas,'' leading to confusion for international travelers.
   Under a plan favored by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of
Kansas, the airport would be named for Eisenhower, but its central
building, designed by famed Finnish architect Eero Saarinen, would
bear Dulles' name.
   Dole is chairman of the Eisenhower Centennial Commission, named
to plan ceremonies to mark the 100th anniversary of Eisenhower's
birth, Oct. 14. Supporters would like to see the name change take
effect by that date.
   Dulles, 46, an analyst for the U.S. Civil Rights Commission in
Los Angeles, said Eisenhower ``was most determined in his belief
that the new airport should be named for his close friend and
secretary of state.''
   ``It is most appropriate that we honor President Eisenhower, on
this the centennial of his birth,'' Dulles said. ``However, it
would certainly not be in keeping with his desires that the tribute
which he accorded my grandfather be taken away in this manner.''
   In a letter to The Associated Press, he said: ``I was dismayed
to learn that Senator Robert Dole has proposed changing the name of
Dulles International Airport. President Eisenhower decreed that the
airport should be named for Secretary Dulles, who flew more than
half a million miles and who was recognized (before the jet era) as
the most traveled Secretary of State in our history.''
   Michael D. Barnes, a member of the Metropolitan Washington
Airports Authority who is lobbying for the change, said, ``My
feeling is that we can honor both of these gentlemen in the manner
that has been proposed in the Dole resolution.''
   The airport authority will decide whether to accept Dole's
recommendation.
   Jane Kratovil, executive director of the Eisenhower World
Affairs Institute, said, ``We think it is an appropriate mechanism
in the Eisenhower centennial year to pay tribute to two individuals
and to try to elevate, if you will, Secretary Dulles' role. As an
outsider, I would say that probably 90 per cent of the people that
land at Dulles today may not even understand that Dulles was indeed
John Foster Dulles, a very important secretary of state.''
   The airport in the Virginia suburbs was built during
Eisenhower's administration and opened in 1962. Dulles, a Wall
Street lawyer long prominent in Republican foreign affairs causes,
served as secretary of state from Eisenhower's inauguration in 1953
until shortly before his death in 1959.
   The secretary's grandson said he also was writing to Dole. The
senator's office said the letter had not been received.

   A coalition of gay activists, human rights and

   ``Research findings suggest that efforts to `repair' homosexuals

accouterments,'' said Bryant L. Welch, executive director for
professional practice of the American Psychological Association.
   Welch spoke at a news conference organized by the National Gay
and Lesbian Task Force.
   Also participating in the news conference were the Rev. William
Sloan-Coffin, president of the SANE-Freeze Campaign for Global
Security, and representatives of the Human Rights Campaign Fund,
Union of American Hebrew Congregations and Federation of Parents
and Friends of Lesbians and Gays Inc.
   The groups hoped to disrupt a weekend meeting of the National
Task Force for the Preservation of the Heterosexual Ethic.
   ``People can be treated, like they can be treated for
alcoholism,'' said the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, who heads the
conservative Traditional Values Coalition that convened the meeting.
   Sheldon argued that reparative therapy has a 50-year history in
behavioral psychology but was removed from the APA's list of
recognized mental disorders in 1973 after presssure from gay rights
activists.
   ``The fact is I have not been able to cure one homosexual,''
said Joseph Nicolosi, a psychologist-consultant to the TVC.
   But Nicolosi said curative efforts must be seen as long-term,
sometimes lifetime processes.
   Sheldon, a Presbyterian minister and his coalition of 6,500
California churches, gained prominence when they helped defeat a
domestic-partnership law in San Francisco.
   Last year, the group tried to include creationism as part of the
science curriculum in state schools.
   Sheldon said his group will publish a report on the meeting,
which is closed to the public, next week.
   A keynote speaker was Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif., an
outspoken critic of homosexuality.

   Two Soviet cosmonauts stationed on the Mir
orbiting complex installed a docking device for a ``space
motorcycle'' and other scientific gear Friday during a three-hour
space walk, Tass said.
   The space walk by Alexander Viktorenko and Alexander Serebrov
was their third in recent weeks. They plan two more before they
return to Earth in mid-February, ending a six-month mission.
   The official Soviet news agency said the cosmonauts assembled a
docking mechanism that will be used later when they install the
``space motorcycle,'' a device to help cosmonauts get around in
open space near the orbiting complex.
   Tass said they also installed a television camera that will be
used for geophysical research and made an inspection of the outside
of their spacecraft and checked their radio communications.
   The two cosmonauts spent three hours and two minutes in space,
the report said.

<HEAD>Modrow Says East Germany Wants Relations With Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hans Modrow, the Communist premier of
East Germany, said Friday his country wants diplomatic relations
with Israel and is willing to consider reparations for victims of
Nazism.
   East Germany has never had full relations with Israel because it
refused to accept responsibility for Adolf Hitler's extermination
of 6 million Jews.
   Modrow told reporters after meeting with Austrian leaders that
East Germany had proposed talks with Israel ``and the problem of
reparations will be aired.''
   Interest in establishing relations with Israel has grown in
Eastern Europe since Communist parties have lost or renounced their
power monopolies.
   West Germany has paid reparations, but Communist East Germany
always claimed its people were the anti-Nazi resistance and bore no
responsibility for Hitler's actions.
   Romania was the only East European nation not to follow the
Soviet Union in breaking relations with Israel after the
Arab-Israeli war of 1967. In September, Hungary became the first to
resume diplomatic ties.
   When asked about his problems at home, Modrow refused to say he
would quit the Communist Party, as some opposition groups demand.
   He said he would be ready to discuss his future relationship
with the party when he had built a coalition government, including
the opposition, that could run East Germany until free elections
scheduled for May 6.
   Modrow criticized the party for slowness in moving away from its
Stalinist past and for abuses under Erich Honecker, who was
Communist Party chief for 18 years until his downfall in October.
   On Friday, Modrow's government faced a new crisis of confidence
Friday when one of the four small parties involved said it would
pull its three ministers out of the 27-member Cabinet.
   Modrow told the news conference he was making a ``fair offer''
of a coalition to East Germany opposition groups, which are divided
over whether to join any government he leads.
   He is to visit Moscow Tuesday for talks with President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.

tanks as a platform for military, civilian and commercial

   The agreement, signed with Global Outpost of Alexandria, is the
first for using the 154-foot-long tanks which now are destroyed in
their plunge through the atmosphere. The tanks carry the 528,000

   A senior member of the House Armed Services
Committee said Friday that if the Bush administration adopts a
partisan approach to closing military bases, a rancorous fight with
Congress is certain.
   Preliminary reports indicate that a large chunk of the bases
slated for closing in Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's new list are
in the districts of congressional Democrats.
   The Pentagon is expected to release the list of bases Monday,
the same day President Bush presents his proposed defense budget to
Congress. Congressional sources and Pentagon documents obtained
Friday said Bush would ask for a $7 billion increase, from this
year's $301.6 billion to $306.9 billion.
   Officials said last-minute changes in the closings list are
possible.
   Congressional and Pentagon sources said that among the bases
targeted are Fort Ord, Calif., in the district of Democratic Rep.
Leon Panetta; Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, represented by Democrat
Thomas Foglietta, and Fort Hood, Texas, located in the district of
Rep. Marvin Leath, also a Democrat.
   Other bases mentioned in Texas are all in the districts of
Democrats while the installations cited in the San Francisco Bay
area are represented by liberal Democrats Barbara Boxer, Nancy
Pelosi and Ronald Dellums.
   Early reports indicated that the Army's Fort Monroe, a training
center in Hampton, Va., was on the base closing list, but a
spokesman for Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican
on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the senator had been
assured the site will not be closed.
   ``There are no significant base closures in Virginia, although
there are several minor realignments,'' said spokesman Phil Smith.
   Fort Monroe is represented in the House by Rep. Herbert Bateman,
a Republican.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., chairman of the House Armed
Services subcomittee on military installations and facilities,
fired a warning shot at the Pentagon on the issue of partisanship
in base closings.
   ``If the Defense Department is going to start playing politics
with the defense budget then, heavan help us, that is an invitation
for the Congress to start playing with it, and who knows where we
can go,'' Schroeder told reporters.
   Among the red flags that Schroeder said she will look for are
base closings that largely target the Air Force and Army, but not
the Navy, and disproportionately few closings in the South and
overseas.
   Pentagon sources said the Air Force and Army were expected to
suffer the brunt of the closures, far in excess of what the Navy
anticipated. ``The Navy's not coughing up much,'' said one official
who requested anonymity.
   Despite the reports, Schroeder said she believed that Cheney,
who served as a representative from Wyoming for 10 years, would not
be ``silly enough'' to target Democratic districts for base
closings.
   ``Cheney knows this place better than any other secretary of
defense,'' she said.
   The Pentagon plans to brief lawmakers early Monday on the bases
it intends to close, said one official. But several members of
Congress have already confirmed rumors of closings in their
districts and complained loudly.
   ``I simply do not understand the logic behind trying to close
down the most productive and efficient yard, while keeping those
yards losing money open,'' Rep. Glenn M. Anderson, D-Calif., said
of plans to shut down the Long Beach Naval Shipyard.
   Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., issued a statement announcing that
the base list does not include any San Diego installations, but
does include Naval Air Facility El Centro, home of the Navy's Blue
Angels, which is in his district.
   Rep. Glen Browder, D-Ala., a member of the House Armed Services
Committee, said that Fort McClellan, located in his district at
Anniston, is among the proposed base closings.
   ``I am not complaining simply because they're aiming at my
district, nor am I criticizing the armed services,'' Browder said.
``They were ordered to cut and being good professional soldiers,
they followed orders and cut to the bottom line.
   ``My complaint is that a numbers crunching machine is
determining national policy without proper direction,'' he said.
   Fort McClellan has 2,700 military and 1,500 civilian personnel.
   Just one year ago, Congress agreed to follow a
congressionally-created commission's recommendation for 86 base
closings and five realignments.
   Last year's closings were part of an all-or-nothing package that
could not be changed. This year's base closings proposals will be
dealt with on an individual basis as the defense budget is reviewed
by the House and Senate armed services committees.
   ``I could have a hearing every hour on the hour,'' Schroeder
said.

<HEAD>Longest-Serving Black in Congress to Retire</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, veteran chairman of
the House Education and Labor Committee and the longest-serving
black in Congress, said Friday that he will retire at the end of
the year.
   Hawkins, one of the last New Deal Democratic liberals still in
office, said he made the decision Thursday night with his wife
after concluding that ``maybe I can do a better job calling
attention to my concerns on the outside than on the inside.''
   The 82-year-old Hawkins has represented the primarily black and
Hispanic Watts area of Los Angeles and surrounding Hispanic suburbs
since 1963, when he became the first black elected to Congress from
a Western state.
   In 1984, he replaced the late Rep. Carl D. Perkins, D-Ky., as
chairman of the education and labor committee. His most likely
successor as the panel's chairman is Rep. William D. Ford, D-Mich.
   Hawkins, in an interview Friday, expressed frustration at the
low priority the government has put on education under the Reagan
and Bush administrations despite passage two years ago of an $8.3
billion school improvement bill named in his honor.
   ``If we only implemented that law as it should be, education
would be at the top of the agenda,'' he said. ``Instead, we're
moving in just the opposite direction, fooling around with fads.''
   While an adamant liberal with a 100 percent favorable voting
record from the AFL-CIO six of the past eight years, Hawkins took a
pragmatic approach in forging alliances with conservatives to
advance his agenda.
   In 1982, for example, he worked with Vice President Dan Quayle,
then a conservativee Republican senator from Indiana, and Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, to assure unions and community activist groups
a voice in allocating wage subsidies to businesses under the Job
Training Partnership Act.
   ``I never tried to play the role of superstar, that's just not
my nature,'' Hawkins said. ``My approach has always been to get
some tangible results. You can't let your ego stand in the way.''
   Last year, he and Hatch formed an alliance to emphasize early,
school-based childhood education for 3- and 4-year-olds as part of
a multibillion-dollar child-care bill that remains stymied because
of opposition from President Bush and conservative Democrats.
   With child care high on the agenda of both the administration
and Democratic leaders again this year, Hawkins said he fears a
compromise now may produce a bad result.
   ``We may end up with two systems,'' he said, ``one in which the
poor will go to inferior care facilities and the wealthy will be
able to take care of their own children.''
   Narrowing the disparity between rich and poor has always been
the focal point of Hawkins' agenda.
   Just a year after entering Congress, he co-authored the 1964
Civil Rights Act Title VII, which created the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission and mandated fair employment practices.
   In 1978, he was the co-author with the late Sen. Hubert Humphrey
of the Humphrey-Hawkins full employment bill, which officially
targets an unemployment rate of 4 percent as the nation's goal.
   For most of the past decade, Hawkins was forced into a role of
tilting at windmills as a leading opponent of the so-called Reagan
revolution. An increase in the $3.35 an hour minimum wage was
shelved for nearly a decade.
   A raise to $4.25 over the next two years was enacted in November
only after House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., bypassed Hawkins
to cut a compromise with Bush's staff chief, John Sununu.

   A federal magistrate entered
innocent pleas Friday for four men accused of plotting to buy a
Stinger missile for the Irish Republican Army.
   The men, who are being represented for free by a legal team
experienced with IRA cases, refused to answer the charges before
U.S. Magistrate Ann Vitunac. The magistrate entered the innocent
pleas and scheduled a Feb. 28 pre-trial hearing in Fort Lauderdale.
   Michael Dowd, a New York attorney for defendant Kevin McKinley,
said the men were advised to stand mute at the arraignment because
defense lawyers may challenge the court's jurisdiction in the case.
He declined to elaborate on a possible basis for the challenge.
   ``At this point I'm not ashamed to say I just don't know how we
are going to proceed,'' said Dowd, who represented one of five
alleged IRA arms suppliers acquitted in a 1982 federal trial in New
York.
   The five-count indictment announced Wednesday charges McKinley,
33; Joseph Martin McColgan, 39; Sean McCann, 34, and Seamus Anthony
Moley, 30, of violating the Neutrality Act and the Arms Export
Control Act, and conspiring to destroy a British aircraft.
   The men were arrested Jan. 12 following a two-month operation by
undercover federal agents posing as arms dealers, according to a
government affidavit.
   A $47,500 cash payment was made for the 5-foot-long,
surface-to-air heat-seeking Stinger missile, which McColgan put in
a car at a West Palm Beach warehouse just before his arrest, the
affidavit said. The other three men were arrested at a store in
North Palm Beach, about 65 miles north of Miami.
   The men were seeking the shoulder-fired missile for the militant
Provisional IRA for use against British military helicopters in
Northern Ireland, the affidavit alleged.
   A U.S. Customs service agent testified in an earlier hearing
that the defendants also expressed interest in .50-caliber rifles,
detonators and plastic explosives.
   If convicted, the men each face 38 years in prison. They were
being held without bond at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
south of Miami.
   Dowd and McColgan's lawyer, Frank Durkan of New York, say they
have defended dozens of suspected IRA members. Both participated in
the so-called ``Brooklyn Five'' case in 1982 in which Irish
Northern Aid Committee founder Michael Flannery and four others
were acquitted of running sub-machine guns to the IRA.
   The defense in that case argued the defendants had shipped arms
to Northern Ireland for 25 years with the tacit approval of the CIA.
   Dowd said all four main defense attorneys have taken the case
for free. Other defense attorneys are Bruce Zimet of Fort
Lauderdale for Moley, and Jo Ann Harris of New York for McCann.

   The United States will close two of its
four major military installations in Greece, leaders of political
parties said Friday.
   They made the announcement after leaders of the three parties
that support the coalition government met with Premier Xenophon
Zolotas.
   Constantine Mitsotakis, who leads the conservative New Democracy
alliance, confirmed a report by the Athens newspaper Ethnos that
U.S. Ambassador Michael Sotirhos advised the government Thursday of
the U.S. decision.
   Socialist Party chief Andreas Papandreou told reporters Zolotas
brought up the U.S. advisory at their meeting. Harilaos Florakis,
head of the Communist Party, said closing the bases would be a
``significant development.''
   Ethnos said Sotirhos delivered a letter from Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney to his Greek counterpart, Tzannis Tzannetakis. It said
Hellenikon Air Base, adjacent to Athens International Airport, and
the U.S. Navy communications station at Nea Makri, 22 miles
southeast of the capital, would close.
   The Pentagon plans to shut dozens of military installations in
the United States and abroad. The two other major U.S. military
installations in Greece, both on the island of Crete, are an Air
Force communications monitoring post and a refueling base for the
Navy's 6th Fleet.
   Hellenikon, used by reconnaisance aircraft to shadow Soviet
fleet movements in the Mediterranean, also is a support station for
U.S. bases in Turkey.
   Nea Makri monitors telephone and telex traffic in the
Mediterranean.
   In addition to the four major bases, the United States has 20
small radar and communications stations in Greece. All were
established under the Defense and Cooperation Agreement of the
mid-1950s, which also provided $350 million a year in U.S. military
aid.
   A five-year agreement, which expired in December 1988, gave the
United States 17 months to dismantle the bases if no new accord was
reached.
   Parliament is to debate a proposal next month to grant a
six-month extension beyond the May 21 deadline in order to give
negotiators more time.
   After 17 rounds with no result, talks were suspended before the
Greek elections in June. A short-lived conservative-Communist
coalition put the issue on hold.
   Officials in Washington said privately the decision to close
Hellenikon and Nea Makri was not related to negotiations on lease
renewal.

   Fugitive Lt. Col. Luis ``Papo''
Cordova, a close associate of Manuel Antonio Noriega and No. 1 man
on the U.S. most-wanted list here, gave up after five weeks of
hiding and was in U.S. Army custody Friday.
   Cordova, who surrendered late Thursday, had been the most
important member of Noriega's inner group still on the loose.
Panamanian authorities want him in connection with the execution of
officers involved in the failed coup against Noriega on Oct. 3.
   He had been in hiding since U.S. forces invaded Panama on Dec.
20 and overthrew dictator Noriega. At one time Cordova sought
refuge in the Peruvian Embassy but was turned down.
   U.S. Army officials said Romulo Escobar Bethancour, a leader of
the Revolutionary Democratic Party that backed the previous
government, also surrendered to the U.S. military.
   Escobar Bethancour was a major negotiator of the 1977 treaties
that transfer the Panama Canal to Panamanian control on Dec. 31,
1999. U.S. officials would not say what charges were pending
against him.
   Since the invasion the U.S. Army has arrested and held many
former government officials or pro-Noriega politicians while the
new government prepares charges against them.
   Sources said Cordova called U.S. officials to arrange for his
surrender. He was in an apartment in a residential building
downtown.
   A source at the attorney general's office said Cordova is
charged in connection with the execution of Maj. Moises Giroldi,
who led the Oct. 3 coup attempt against Noriega. At the time,
Giroldi was said to have died in action, but later reports said he
and other rebels were executed.
   Cordova also is wanted for questioning in connection with the
beheading of Hugo Spadafora, who tried to organize a guerrilla war
against Noriega.
   Both Cordova and Escobar Bethancour were taken to Fort Clayton.
   At least 50 other former high-ranking officers of the Defense
Forces also are being held there since their arrest or capture
after the U.S. invasion.
   The Inter-American Press Association said Friday that press
freedoms have improved considerably since the Dec. 20 invasion.
   An IAPA mission led by its prresident, Edward Seaton, visited
Panama for three days ``to study the situation of the
communications media after the U.S. military action and change of
government in this country.''
   Seaton told reporters his group informed the government of its
concern that at least 10 radio stations and two TV stations
remained in government hands.
   ``The IAPA has asked the government that these media, after an
adequate investigation, determine what belongs to the state and put
them in private hands through equitable means,'' said an IAPA
statement.
   The statement said that despite the improvements the IAPA was
recommending, Panama has ``improved very much'' the conditions for
freedom of expression.
   The IAPA commission also asked that the government quickly
resolve the cases of three journalists arrested during the invasion.
   Previously, the government controlled all major broadcast and
print media in Panama.

   About 250 anarchists built flaming
roadblocks and battled police Friday after an appeals court
acquitted a policeman who killed a young protester in 1985.
   Police fired tear gas at rioters who burned a police bus, said
an officer at the scene who spoke on condition of anonymity. He
said the protestors attacked police with gasoline bombs, sticks and
stones.
   An officer at police headquarters said four policemen were
``slightly injured in stone-throwing incidents.''
   He said the anarchists broke into Athens Polytechnic, which they
were using as a staging point, and riot squads had pulled back out
of sight.
   All traffic on Patission Street, one of the capital's main
streets, was halted Friday night because of the disturbance, the
officer at the scene reported. He said no arrests have been made.
   Earlier Friday, an Athens appeals court voted 6-1 to acquit
Athanassios Melistas, 30, originally sentenced to 2{ years in
prison for manslaughter and illegal use of a weapon.
   Melistas was accused of shooting 15-year-old Mihalis Kaltezas on
Nov. 17, 1985, when anarchists attacked a police bus after a march
commemorating a 1973 student uprising against the military
government then in power.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Friday lifted a ban on drug
testing for 19 employees in the Executive Office of the President
who have ``top secret'' security clearances, but continued to bar
the tests for 10 others authorized to see information only up to
the level of ``secret.''
   In a lawsuit, the employees are challenging random, mandatory
urinalysis called for by Bush administration officials, who declare
that the employees hold sensitive positions and should be tested.
The employees are in the Office of Management and Budget, the
Office of Administration and the Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative.
   U.S. District Court Judge Louis Oberdorfer said it is
``unlikely'' that those with top secret clearances will prevail in
the case, although he allowed that portion of the lawsuit to
proceed.
   The judge said ``the permissibility of subjecting'' the 10
others to drug tests ``is less clear'' and he kept the ban in place.
   The government contends, in effect, that information classified
as secret is by definition as truly sensitive as top secret
information, noted the judge.
   On the record to date in the lawsuit, ``the government is not
likely to prevail on what is apparently the essence of its
rationale: that a government agency may, in its discretion, test
the urine of any employee who possesses a secret security
clearance,'' said Oberdorfer.
   The judge issued the preliminary injunction May 19 covering a
group of federal employees who do not hold White House passes.
   A 1982 executive order draws the distinction between top secret
and secret information by saying that disclosure of the former
could reasonably be expected to cause ``exceptionally grave
damage'' to the national security. Disclosure of secret information
could reasonably be expected to cause ``serious'' damage, says the
executive order.
   Some 2 million federal workers have secret clearances, including
State Department personnel with access to routine cables to
custodial workers at nuclear weapons plants.

   Troops searched from house to house
Friday for pro-Pakistan Moslems waging a violent separatist
campaign in Kashmir, and the government imposed a virtual news
blackout.
   At least 70 people, most of them Moslem militants, have been
killed since the government began a crackdown Saturday to try to
halt separatist violence.
   Witnesses in Srinagar, summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state,
said soldiers and paramilitary commandos of the elite National
Security Guard were searching the city. Similar searches were
reported in the nearby towns of Anantnag and Baramulla.
   Many residents of Srinagar refused to switch on lights after
dusk in protest of the crackdown.
   Journalists were confined to a hotel and told they would be
arrested, or even shot, if they stepped outside. They were denied
access to telex and telephone lines after the warning.
   In Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, Premier Sikander Hyat Khan of
Pakistani Kashmir said he would launch a Moslem ``holy war'' unless
the United Nations schedules a special session to address the
Kashmir issue.
   Muzaffarabad is the capital of Pakistani Kashmir and near the
cease-fire that has divided the region between India and Pakistan
since 1947, when the subcontinent became independent of Britain and
the two nations were created. India and Pakistan have fought four
wars, three of them specifically over Kashmir.
   Most of the 5 million people in the Indian State of
Jammu-Kashmir are Moslems. It is the only state with a Moslem
majority in India, a predominantly Hindu nation.
   ``If the United Nations is not ready to play its role ... I will
tell them to go and fight,'' Khan warned of the people in Pakistani
Kashmir.
   He gave the world organization until Feb. 17 to schedule a
special session. He said the deadline coincided with a scheduled
meeting all Pakistani political and religious parties in Islamabad.
   Tariq Mahmood Butt, head of the student wing of the militant
Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, said thousands of its members would
cross the frontier Feb. 11 if the United Nations did not promise
action.
   Indian state television described the situation in Jammu-Kashmir
as ``by and large peaceful,'' but said paramilitary troops fired on
rioters Thursday in Handwara, 40 miles northwest of Srinagar. A
government spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 11
people were killed and 14 wounded.
   Troops in Srinagar tightened restrictions under the 24-hour
curfew and prevented residents from opening windows, said witnesses
reached by telephone.
   From various vantage points in Srinagar, a city of 1 million,
only heavily armed troopers and an occasional government official
could be seen on the streets. Several people reached by telephone
from inside and outside Srinagar said they had not heard gunfire.
   Police sources in Jammu, winter capital of the state, said
militants hurled a gasoline bomb at soldiers during house searches
but no one was injured.
   The increased security coincided with the Moslem sabbath and
Republic Day, which major towns and cities in India usually
celebrate with military parades.
   Moslem separatists in Jammu-Kashmir, who want the state to be
either independent or joined to Pakistan, declared the national
holiday a ``black day.''
   Television showed Jameel Qureshi, adviser to the Jammu-Kashmir
state governor, taking the salute at a parade in Srinagar's Bakshi
Stadium. No civilian spectators were shown and a policeman who was
there said none attended.
   District magistrate Ghulam Abbas told about 20 journalists at
the Hotel Broadway: ``If you go out of the hotel, you can be shot,
and if we find out you have gone out, you can be imprisoned for six
months.''
   Soldiers with submachine guns were posted around the hotel,
which is about a mile from downtown Srinagar. The door leading to
the roof of the five-story building was locked and telephone
service was halted after the warning by Abbas.
   Seven journalists returned to New Delhi on a commercial flight
Friday afternoon. They said police took them to the Srinagar
airport by a circuitous route one officer said was designed to
skirt trouble. Police at the airport confiscated dozens of rolls of
film, they said.
   The Moslem separatist campaign is as old as the two nations, but
has escalated in recent weeks.
   Srinagar and surrounding towns were put under 24-hour curfew
Saturday and soldiers and paramilitary troopers were deployed.
Their number has not been released, but is known to be at least in
the hundreds.

   A federal judge ordered Manuel Noriega held without
bond Friday after his attorneys repudiated the court's
jurisdiction, insisting the deposed dictator be declared a prisoner
of war and transferred to a neutral country.
   The prosecution gave several reasons why Noriega should not be
released on bail, and suggested he may have placed a voodoo-type
curse on four Americans, including the U.S. District Court judge
himself, William Hoeveler, and U.S. Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh.
   The government said the names were found at a Noriega office
where a black magic altar was discovered during the U.S. invasion
of Panama.
   Prosecutors listed homes, bank deposits, sports cars and other
assets worth up to $30 million, including $5.8 million in cash
found in Noriega's Panama ranch, to bolster their argument that
Noriega would flee the country if necessary.
   They also said Noriega is an expert in counterterrorism and
covert actions and still has a loyal band of armed followers.
   ``Mr. Noriega is an extraordinary danger to the community,''
prosecutor Myles Malman told Hoeveler, noting that Noriega faces
145 years in prison.
   Hoeveler, noting the defense's refusal to participate in the
bond hearing, said he had no choice but to order Noriega, 51, held
without bond.
   Defense attorney Frank Rubino, opened the hearing by telling the
judge the defense would not participate because it challenges the
jurisdiction of the U.S. court system and his client is covered by
the Geneva Convention. Noriega sat quietly nearby in military
uniform listening with interpreters' headphones. The motion said
Noriega in a letter delivered Friday morning to President Bush and
the secretary of state ``claimed the status of prisoner of war
pursuant to the Geneva Convention.''
   ``There can be absolutely no question, whatsoever, that the
invasion of Panama by the United States military totally and
completely fulfills the definition of armed conflict,'' Rubino
said, reading from the motion.
   Hoeveler did not consider the motion immediately and Malman
began his arguments against bond in the hearing stemming from the
February 1988 drug indictment.
   As part of his presentation, Malman implied that a curse may
have been placed on Hoeveler, Thornburgh and two other men whose
names were found on a white sheet of paper confiscated by U.S.
troops at Noriega's Fort Amador office _ referred to as the ``Witch
House'' because of black magic paraphernalia discovered there.
   The other two named on the list were Charles Saphos, head of the
Justice Department's drug section, and Mark Schnapp, a former Miami
federal prosecutor who helped bring about the Noriega indictment.
   ``Maybe I better not enter it into evidence,'' the judge joked
as Malman handed him the list.
   Malman promised the government would show that Noriega has a
$400,000 condominum in Paris, and that $5,800,000 in cash was found
in envelopes marked ``confidential'' in his three-story home in
Panama. The prosecution also introduced photos of deposit slips
showing that Noriega's 17-year-old daughter deposited $1.3 million
in Panamanian banks in September 1989.
   ``The U.S. govenment has frozen $20 million in Noriega assets _
$4.8 million in Luxembourg; $2.3 million in France, $8 million in
Switzerland, $1.6 million in Austria and $3.5 million in other
accounts that we do not wish to disclose at this time,'' Malman
said.
   The prosecution maintained that Noriega also transferred about
$19 million from his account at Bank of Credit and Commerce
International's London branch to its Luxembourg branch a week after
the indictment was unsealed. It was not clear whether the deposits
and seizures were duplicated in the prosecution's listings.
   In addition to the vast sums Noriega was said to have deposited
overseas, Malman said Noriega also had friends in countries at odds
with the United States, including Cuba and Libya. He noted that
Moammar Gadhafi had presented Noriega with his and hers Gadhafi
watches which the Libyan leader gives to personal acquaintances.
   Asked by Hoeveler at the end of the session if he wished to
rebut prosecution arguments, Rubino replied by reciting Noriega's
name, rank and serial number _ 0001.
   The defense motion had noted that ``Noriega, in his capacity as
chief of state and commander in chief of the Panamanian Defense
Forces was recognized as the leader of the Republic of Panama by
the United Nations, the Organization of American States and
independent governments in this hemisphere and throughout the
world.''
   The defense contends that an international tribunal, perhaps the
World Court at The Hague or Geneva, must automatically be invoked
by Noriega's alleged POW status.
   Noriega has been held without bail since he was flown to the
United States Jan. 4 and jailed in the federal courthouse basement
here to face 12 drug-trafficking counts from the 1988 indictment.
   The defense had refused to ask for bail because of the denial of
U.S. jurisdiction in his case. Prosecutors, however, feared that
failure to guard Noriega's rights could later undermine their case.
   Under a federal magistrate's orders, defense attorneys Rubino
and Steven Kollin have given prosecutors a list of two homes and
three offices Noriega used in Panama. In return, the government was
to supply an inventory of what was taken from the residences before
Friday's bond hearing began.
   The hearing was the first time attorneys for Noriega or his five
co-defendants, in custody or out on bond, have seen any of the
government's case. Ten others named in the indictment are still at
large.
   Richard Sharpstein, an attorney for co-defendant Brian Alden
Davidow, attended the hearing and talked briefly with Noriega
before the judge arrived.
   ``He has a good sense of humor,'' Sharpstein said. ``I asked him
if he was going to watch the Super Bowl with George Bush, and he
laughed and gave me the thumbs up.''

   President Vaclav Havel of
Czechoslovakia suggested Friday that Eastern Europen countries
emerging from Communist domination form an informal,
market-oriented union.
   ``It is clear that our countries, which only recently were
Soviet satellites, are now seeking the path to democracy and to
rejoining Europe,'' Havel told reporters at the end of a one-day
visit to Hungary. ``It only stands to reason we should see about
coordinating our moves.''
   Havel said he planned to organize a meeting in April of
government and opposition leaders from Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia. He said the foreign ministers of Austria, Italy and
Yugoslavia also would be invited to the conference in Bratislava,
capital of Slovakia.
   ``The purpose would be to discuss not only the possibilities of
our return to Europe, but also the sort of Europe we want to return
to,'' said the Czechoslovak president, a playwright who was his
country's leading dissident before Communist rule crumbled last
month.
   Havel did not mentioned precise areas of possible cooperation
and said policy coordination would not interfere with individual
projects involving outside countries.
   He said Czechoslovakia had accepted an invitation by President
Matyas Szueroes of Hungary to link policies with Austria, Hungary,
Italy and Yugoslavia.
   Poland and Czechoslovakia also are initiating ``northern Baltic
cooperation, with Czechoslovakia acting as a link'' with Austria,
Hungary, Italy and Yugoslavia,'' Havel added, without giving
details.
   It was not clear whether that project would extend to the three
Soviet Baltic republics, which seek autonomy or independence.
   On a visit Thursday to Warsaw, Havel proposed that
Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary work together to rejoin Europe
as politically independent states.
   In a brief address to Poland's parliament, he expressed hope
that ``the Prague parliament, too, will soon be a real parliament,
with a strong and intelligent opposition sitting across from me in
the chamber.''
   Czechoslovakia plans free elections in June. Hungary's elections
are scheduled for March.

   For the first time, veterans would be required
to make down payments on VA home loans to buy even the most
modestly priced houses under a proposal in President Bush's new
budget, sources say.
   Officials of veterans groups were quick to denounce the idea,
with one of them saying such a plan ``dashes the dreams of
countless veterans of participating in the American dream of home
ownership.''
   And Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the House
Veterans Affairs Committee, said simply on Friday, ``I'm not going
to buy that,'' though he added he was pleased with other aspects of
the budget request.
   ``I will strongly oppose all changes in the fundamental nature
of this important veterans benefit,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Veteran Affairs Committee.
   According to sources familiar with the proposal, Bush's $31
billion budget request for veterans programs will include a request
that military vets be required to make a 4 percent down payment for
loans over $25,000.
   The VA has already imposed a 5 percent down payment requirement
for its mobile home loan program.
   And an unofficial down payment system already is permitted to
exist for relatively expensive houses. For example, a borrower who
wants to buy an $80,000 home but whose income would permit the
purchase of only a $75,000 home under the VA program can pay a
$5,000 ``down payment'' to make up the difference.
   But such a broad down-payment requirement is unprecedented for
the 45-year-old VA program instituted as American men returned home
after World War II.
   Under the Bush proposal, due to be released Monday, VA-insured
loans under $25,000 would still be exempt from any down payment.
The exemption is designed to cover home improvements such as
additions to a house.
   In another area, the budget for veterans will call for federal
spending of $12.3 billion for health care, $1 billion more than
appropriated for the current fiscal year, according to the sources,
who commented on condition they not be named.
   That total would cover actual health care services provided by
the Veterans Affairs Department, not entitlement payments such as
disability compensation.
   Cranston said that if the medical-care figure proves accurate,
Veterans Secretary ``Ed Derwinski has done a tremendous job in
convincing the president that the downward spiral in VA health care
must be haulted.''
   Federal Housing Administration loans, also government-insured,
already require a 5 percent down payment, while conventional home
loans outside government programs can require down payments as high
as 20 percent.
   The GI home loan program was begun to ease the housing crunch
for returning soldiers and to stimulate the construction industry
after World War II. The lack of a down payment requirement has been
a key advantage.
   The program has undergone heavy losses in the past, due to heavy
foreclosures, especially as a result of the oil depression in Texas
and Oklahoma.
   According to the VA Department, 178,000 guaranteed loans will be
closed in this fiscal year, with the average loan amounting to
$70,000.
   The administration also proposes to increase the ``mortgage
indemnity fee'' from 1.25 percent to 1.75 percent. That fee, which
began this month as a result of a law passed late last year, is
used to back up the home loans and to protect veterans from
liability in case of foreclosure.
   Before that, borrowers paid only a 1 percent origination fee.
   ``If the 4 percent proposed down payment to the VA home loan
above $25,000 is part of the budget, it represents a drastic change
in the very concept and intent of the 45-year-old VA home loan
program,'' said Larry W. Rivers, executive director of the Veterans
of Foreign Wars.
   ``It is an unreasonable, an unfair proposal, which dashes the
dreams of countless veterans of participating in the American dream
of home ownership,'' he said.
   Said spokesman John Hanson of the American Legion: ``If that's
going to be a plan then it seems like the VA again is trying to
make veterans bail out the home loan program, a program whose
problems veterans have not created.
   ``And it seems very odd that raising the indemnity fee before
it's had time to work is going to be part of the solution.''
   Veterans groups say veterans are being unfairly blamed for
defaults. They say losses are due to poor administration of the
program, especially in determining eligibility, and to the VA
selling off its good loan portfolios in order to lower the deficit.
   As for health-care funding, the proposed increase would still
leave spending short of the amounts requested by veterans
organizations.
   Although Congress appropriated $11.5 billion for fiscal 1990 for
health care, but $160 million was cut from that under the
Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law.
   The total proposed increase would go largely for personnel
costs. Included is $70 million in pay increases for VA doctors,
nurses and other health care professionals in order to slow
departures to higher-paying private jobs.
   The veterans service groups say $13.4 billion is needed for
health care funding for 1991. In a letter last December to the
White House, Cranston urged Bush to restore the $160 million and
request a $252.4 million supplemental appropriation for 1990.

   Local officials are looking for
someone who will pay $50,000 for their statue of Josef Stalin.
   Vladimir Till, deputy chairman of the Zabreh Municipal National
Committee, told the daily Mlada Fronta at least two West Germans
had expressed interest in the 12-foot statue since a For Sale ad
was placed in Wednesday's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
   The official Czechoslovak news agency CTK said Alois Frank,
another official of this town about 100 miles northeast of Prague,
reported that ``many other media want to print the advertisement''
and he felt it was only a question of time before buyers appeared.
   The statue of the Soviet dictator was removed from public
display Dec. 8. It had stood since 1950, three years before
Stalin's death, and was paid for with funds originally earmarked
for a likeness of Tomas G. Masaryk, founder of the Czechoslovak
republic.

   President Bush will propose a $7 billion
increase in military spending in the new budget, including money
for five B-2 stealth bombers and two land-based nuclear missiles,
according to congressional sources and Pentagon documents.
   The budget, to be released formally on Monday, includes a
reduction of 38,000 in military personnel, the mothballing of two
battleships and cancellation of several weapons programs, including
the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the Army's
M-1 tank.
   Planned budget outlays for the year beginning Oct. 1 total
$303.3 billion _ up 2.4 percent, less than inflation, from this
year's $296.3 billion _ according to military spending documents
made available to The Associated Press Friday by congressional
sources.
   The figure includes $292.1 billion for Pentagon spending, up
from $286.8 billion, with the rest representing Energy Department
spending for nuclear programs.
   Total budget authority for the military would be $306.9 billion,
up from $301.6 billion, also including Energy Department money.
   Pentagon officials, confirming the figures, stressed that the
spending would represent a 2 percent decline in defense purchasing
power after inflation.
   Following the buildup of the early Reagan years, so-called
``real'' defense spending _ that is, spending after inflation has
been factored out _ has been declining slightly since 1986, even
though the Reagan and Bush administrations have been calling for
modest real increases. The new budget will represent the first
proposal by an administration since the 1970s for a real decrease.
   The budget figures come on the heels of dramatic changes in
Eastern Europe that have raised speculation that a diminishing
Soviet threat could lead to reduced military budgets in the United
States.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in comments included in the
documents, said the budget ``represents the first steps in
responding to changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, as
well as tighter budget constraints.''
   Cheney said that while defense cuts were in order, this is ``the
worst possible time to contemplate changes in defense strategy.''
   Defense Department officials have been talking for weeks about
military reductions that would save $180 billion over five years.
But those savings are measured against Bush administration plans
made last spring to boost Pentagon spending to levels now seen as
unrealistically high.
   Among the proposals in the budget is $5.5 billion in Pentagon
spending for five B-2 stealth bombers. Congress last year approved
funds for components for the five bombers in fiscal 1991, but that
total is still expected to come under attack on Capitol Hill where
lawmakers have expressed sticker shock over the cost of the
radar-evading bombers _ about $530 million apiece.
   The budget also includes $2.8 billion for 12 multiple-warhead,
MX rail-garrison missiles and $202 million for the single-warhead,
Midgetman missile. The fiscal 1990 budget that emerged from
Congress included slightly more than $1 billion for the two
land-based nuclear missiles.
   Money for the Strategic Defense Initiative _ popularly known as
Star Wars _ totals about $4.5 billion in Pentagon spending, which
when added to about $300 million in Department of Energy and
military construction money amounts to $4.8 billion, a $1 billion
increase over the amount Congress approved last year.
   The budget also includes plans to mothball two battleships, the
USS New Jersey and the USS Iowa, and various cancellations of
weapons programs, some of which had been placed on the chopping
block last year.
   Among the programs terminated are the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey
tilt-rotor aircraft, the Navy's F-14D jet fighter, the Phoenix and
Maverick missiles, the Apache helicopter, the Army Helicopter
Improvement Program (AHIP), the F-15E fighter and the M-1 tank.
Congress kept the V-22 and the F-14D alive last year over
administration objections.
   The budget calls for a reduction in active troop strength by
38,000 from the nearly 2.1 million and cuts in civilian forces of
5,000 and reserves by 3,000.
   At the Pentagon, a senior administration official focused on the
idea that the spending would represent a decline in purchasing
power after inflation is taken into account.
   ``It means that we will be able to buy fewer planes, tanks, and
ships, and support fewer troops,'' said the official, who spoke
only on condition he not be named.

   Four men brandishing pistols and grenades
were shot to death by security guards that foiled their attempt to
hijack a domestic Iran Air flight, Tehran radio reported Friday.
   The broadcast quoted an official of the Internal Security Force,
whose agents overcame the hijackers, as saying hijackers with hand
grenades and Colt pistols had taken a crew member hostage in an
attempt to force the pilot to fly the Boeing 727 to Israel or Iraq.
   The radio said the hijackers of Thursday's flight were
``American agents whose attempts to hijack an Iranian airliner were
foiled.''
   Iran Air Flight 133 was on a flight from Shiraz to the port city
of Bandar Abbas, the radio reported.
   It said the hijackers attempted to take control of the plane
about 90 miles from Shiraz, in southern Iran.
   The Internal Security Force, whose agents fly on every Iran Air
flight, said all four hijackers were killed in a shootout with
agents on board the plane.
   None of the passengers were wounded and the plane returned to

   A mediator said Friday that
black workers and management have agreed tentatively to end a
12-week-old railway strike that killed more than 30 people and
caused millions of dollars in property damage.
   The far-right Conservative Party denounced the settlement
involving the state-owned South African Transport Services, saying
the government had ``capitulated to radical groups.''
   ``It is shocking that after one of the most violent strikes .. .
the strikers have again been installed in their posts,'' party
transport spokesman Jurg Prinsloo said.
   Charles Nupen, who began mediation efforts last week, said
management of Transport Services and officials of the South African
Railways and Harbor Workers Union planned to sign the accord
Saturday.
   Neither the union nor management would comment on the tentative
agreement.
   Nupen said the company agreed to recognize the union, as
demanded by the 25,000 strikers. But the statement said nothing of
a requested pay increase.
   The company fired almost all the strikers, but agreed to rehire
them, Nupen said.
   The walkout was illegal under legislation that bars industrial
action against essential services. The transport company employs
about 170,000 people and runs rail and harbor operations nationwide.
   The workers struck Nov. 2, demanding that the minimum monthly
wage be increased from $240 to $600.
   Numerous battles between strikers and non-strikers followed.
Railway coaches and track were sabotaged in dozens of incidents.
   The company says it suffered property damage of $16 million.

   A powerful storm that killed at least 94 people in
northwest Europe swept into the Baltic Sea on Friday, sinking a
Danish ship and leaving behind hundreds of injured and damage
estimated at more than $1 billion.
   The storm, with winds recorded Thursday at 110 mph, knocked out
communications and power and paralyzed transportation in large
areas of Britain and the Continent.
   Shipping was badly disrupted and $29 million worth of
greenhouses were shattered in Holland's flower-growing region.
   With winds diminished but still at gale force, the storm moved
across the Baltic on Friday, hitting Scandinavia, northern Poland
and the Soviet republics of Latvia and Lithuania, Britain's
meteorological center said.
   Britain was hardest hit, with 46 people reported killed by
collapsing roofs, falling trees, and in traffic accidents.
   Official reports said 19 people died in Holland, 10 in Belgium,
eight in France, seven in West Germany and four in Denmark.
   Crews scrambled on Friday to restore power to a million homes
and clear toppled cars from cluttered highways.
   On Thursday wind tore a hole in the roof of Parliament in London
and toppled a nuclear plant chimney in France.
   The European Community said it would aid victims of the storm
after it completes an assessment of the damage.
   In the Baltic Sea, the Danish boat Jotun sank Friday off East
Germany in heavy seas. A Danish helicopter rescued three crew
members, but one later died. Three others were missing and presumed
dead after their lifeboat was found empty.
   Dutch authorities said hundreds of Dutch were injured in the
storm, the worst in a decade. Four main rail lines remained closed
Friday.
   The death toll in Britain far exceeded that of Oct. 16, 1987,
when the country's worst storm in centuries left 17 people dead.
   That storm struck late at night, when most people were indoors.
The storm Thursday caught motorists on country roads where falling
trees caused many deaths. Trucks flipped over on major highways,
making them impassable. Children were at school, and two died and
16 were hurt when roofs collapsed.
   Roof tiles, scaffolding and heaps of brick from collapsed
chimneys littered sidewalks around London. The government said at
one point 1 million people, mostly in western England, were without
electric power.
   Subway, rail, bus and air services halted in the London area
Thursday but transport workers were out through the night clearing
debris from the tracks and were able to restore much of the rail
service by Friday.
   The London newspaper The Independent said insurers put early
estimates of damage to property in Britain at more than $1.3
billion, compared with $1.8 billion for the 1987 storm.
   In Sweden, winds uprooted trees and damaged houses, but no
injuries were reported.
   In Belgium, winds reached 105 mph, bending or knocking down
power, radio and television towers and destroying countless
buildings in towns and rural areas. At least three people were
crushed by trees, cyclists were swept under trucks and people were
blown from roofs while trying to make repairs.
   The storm struck a large area of West Germany, from Hamburg, in
the north, where streets were flooded; to Bavaria in the south,
where damaged cars and fallen trees littered roads.
   A West German Navy helicopter rescued 29 people from the Soviet
fish factory ship Briz, which ran into rough seas off the Dutch
island of Terschelling. A Belgian helicopter picked up another 19
crew members.
   A helicopter and rescue boat searched the English Channel for
three French sailors missing since their catamaran capsized while
being towed Thursday.
   The storm disrupted ferry services across the channel on
Thursday.
   On Friday morning, ferries were back on the channel, and service
was restored between Scotland and Northern Ireland, where heavy
snow added to road problems.
   ``These are the worst weather conditions I have ever seen in
well over 20 years of service,'' said Capt. James Martin, skipper
and P and O's Pride of Kent ferry.
   A chimney was blown down at the Paluel nuclear power plant in
France. State-owned Electricite de France said the plant was shut
down immediately.
   France's Central Service for Protection against Ion Radiation
issued a statement Friday saying there was no danger of a radiation
leak, but said it would increase surveillance at the site until the
stack is rebuilt.
   The government's Meteorological Office, which is responsible for
weather forecasting in Britain, said severe conditions had been
widely forecast since Sunday and that warnings had been broadcast.
   But David Blunkett, environment spokesman for the opposition
Labor Party, accused Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative government of failing to take precautions.
   ``Adequate (government) warnings would have helped, so would
appropriate civil defense preparation,'' Blunkett said.
   The failure of the Meteorological Office to forecast the 1987
hurricane in Britain led to severe criticism and an official
inquiry. This found that the weathermen had followed computer
projections too rigidly and failed to take into account factors
that might have shown the computer forecast in error.

   President Bush told Congress Friday that
Panama is now cooperating in international anti-drug efforts as
Vice President Dan Quayle headed for meetings with Latin leaders to
soothe anger at the U.S. invasion.
   Bush sent the certificnt of
President Guillermo Endara has made the war against drugs a
centerpiece of its program.''
   Bush said Panama's government and people ``recognize that it is
in their direct national interest to end their association with the
scourge of drugs,'' citing the return of Noriega to the United
States to face drug-trafficking charges.
   Quayle left Friday evening for Honduras, where he was to attend
the presidential inauguration on Saturday, and meet with six
attending heads of state later in the day. The presidents of Costa
Rica, Venezuela, Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador as well as Honduras
scheduled meetings with Quayle.
   In addition to their bilateral concerns, a topic of discussion
was expected to be the continued presence of U.S. troops in Panama,
which has particularly rankled the South Americans. The Central
American nations were generally less strident in their criticisms
of the invasion.
   ``I hope the reception is a good one,'' Quayle told reporters
before leaving on the trip Friday evening. ``My message will be one
of friendship, consultation, where do we go from here. How do we
build democracy in Panama. How do we build how do we build
democracy in our Western Hemisphere.''
   Asked if he expected to encounter opposition from the leaders he
sees, he replied, ``I'll find out when I get there.''
   Quayle has stressed that he hopes to consult with the Latin
leaders on future cooperation, and urge them to recognize the
Endara government rather than focusing on the past or
``fence-mending'' efforts.
   However, Bush has said he recognizes the hurt feelings that
remain over the Panama invasion, widely viewed in the region as an
invasion of Panama's sovereignty. In addition, the Latin countries
did not look kindly on U.S troops surrounding the Vatican Embassy
where Noriega initially took refuge or the intrusion into the home
of the Nicaraguan ambassador.
   Bush said he wants Quayle to explain that the invasion, aimed at
toppling Noriega, was not taken just to show wanton use of military
might.
   Quayle travels Sunday to Panama, where he will discuss details
of Bush's $1 billiion aid package, much of which will need
congressional approval for the spending.
   On Monday, Quayle will stop in Jamaica, where he is expected to
face complaints about a $25 million cut in U.S. economic assistance
to that Caribbean nation.

<TEXT>
   The government confirmed for
the first time Friday that it had received a written peace proposal
from jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, but said its contents were
secret.
   The country's most powerful right-wing politician, Andries
Treurnicht of the pro-apartheid Conservative Party, demanded the
government halt its consultations with Mandela. The prisoner's goal
was ``white surrender,'' Treurnicht said.
   Mandela, South Africa's best-known black leader, is expected to
be freed within weeks after more than 27 years in prison. He is
serving a life sentence for helping plan the start of an
anti-government sabotage campaign by the outlawed African National
Congress.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said Friday that he received from
Mandela on Dec. 12 a proposal titled ``A Document to Create a
Climate of Understanding.''
   ``The document is confidential and enjoys the status of a useful
background document,'' said Coetsee.
   The same document reportedly has been forwarded to the ANC's
exiled leaders. It is believed to suggest steps to bring about
negotiations between the government and the ANC, which has the
largest following among South Africa's black majority.
   Mandela has met regularly in recent months with government and
anti-apartheid leaders. Coetsee, one of the officials involved in
these meetings, said last week the government might accept
Mandela's offer to serve as mediator in negotiations with the ANC.
   On Thursday, South newspaper, an anti-apartheid weekly in Cape
Town, published a policy document written by Mandela urging such
negotiations. Both Mandela and Coetsee said Friday this was not the
peace proposal submitted in December.
   Mandela said he wrote the policy document early last year,
handed it to a team of government officials, and informed the ANC
of it. He denied news reports that he had presented the document to
then-President P.W. Botha when they met in July or to President
F.W. de Klerk when they met in December.
   De Klerk, who took office in August, says he wants to ease
restrictions on political activity to the extent that the ANC will
agree to talks.
   Mandela wrote that the negotiators' crucial task will be to
reconcile blacks' demands for majority rule with whites' desire for
protection from black domination.
   ``Most Africans, black and white, hope to see the ANC and the
government working closely together for a new era in our country in
which racial discrimination and prejudice, coercion and
confrontation, death and destruction, will be forgotten,'' he wrote.
   ``The move I have taken (to serve as mediator) provides you with
the opportunity to overcome the current deadlock,'' he wrote. ``I
hope you will seize it without delay.''
   Treurnicht, whose party won 31 percent of the white vote in
general elections last year, said the government was ``making a
myth of a man who had been found guilty of a crime similar to high
treason.''
   ``What Mandela and the ANC demand is the transfer of power to
the so-called majority,'' Treurnicht said. ``It must be clearly
understood that the white people will under no circumstances
negotiate its own demise.''

<TEXT>
   Police searched Friday for the killers
of five people who were found shot to death execution-style in what
authorities say were drug-related murders.
   Police, citing testimony from neighbors and the victims' four
children, who were not hurt, said four men burst into a home early
Thursday in rural White Hall, on the island's mountainous east end,
and killed each of the victims with a single shot to the head.
   National Security Minister K.D. Knight flew by helicopter to the
scene and described it as a ``horror story.''
   Those killed were taxi driver Samuel Reid, 34, his common-law
wife Sharon Morris, 26; Ernest Moyston, 31, unemployed; his
common-law wife Carlene Munroe, 26; and her twin sister Arlene
Ashley. All were White Hall residents.
   The intruders demanded money and marijuana from the group, shot
Moyston, Ms. Munroe and Ms. Ashley in Moyston's house, then took
Reid and Ms. Morris outside and shot them across the road under a
banana tree, police said.
   Police said they believed the shooting had something to do with
a dispute over marijuana smuggling. The adjacent homes of Reid and
Moyston were ransacked, and an undetermined amount of money was
stolen from Moyston's house.
   Police said the two families were neighbors and known to be
close friends.
   Moyston's 11-year-old daughter Janice and 6-year-old son Andre,
and Reid's two children, both under 13, were awakened by the
shooting but were not taken hostage or hurt, police said.

   President Bush on Friday announced another big
increase in proposed spending _ this time for Head Start _ in a
$1.2 trillion 1991 budget he said was designed to provide
``opportunity for all.''
   At the same time, however, economists were saying the optimistic
deficit projections underpinning Bush's spending plan were
threatened by signs of a weakening economy.
   The anemic 0.5 percent growth in the gross national product
reported Friday for the final three months of 1989 could make
meeting the new budget's deficit-reduction goals all but
impossible, some analysts contended.
   From proposed increases in spending for wildlife and recreation
to tougher terms for home-buying military veterans, details of
Bush's budget were sprouting all over official Washington in
advance of Monday's official release of the spending plan for the
year beginning Oct. 1.
   Bush himself was anything but tight-lipped, announcing some of
the increases himself and telling the U.S. Conference of Mayors
that his budget would ``build on prosperity'' and ``together we can
create opportunity for all.''
   One day after unveiling the anti-drug portion of his budget,
calling for a spending increase of $1.1 billion, he proposed what
he hailed as ``the largest increase ever'' for Head Start, a $500
million gain for the preschool program for disadvantaged youths.
   Administration officials say the budget will re-propose much of
Bush's ``unfinished agenda'' from 1989. According to administration
and congressional officials, the budget will include these
highlights:
   _No new general tax hikes and a renewal of Bush's call for a
lower capital gains tax rate, a tax credit for adoptions and for
child care.
   _Increased spending for environmental, education and drug
programs but a $8.5 billion slash in Medicare funds, and a
requirement that veterans for the first time be required to make
down payments of 4 percent on VA home loans as small as $25,000.
   _The most austere Pentagon budget in more than a decade. Bush
will propose $292 billion in new outlays, up only slightly from
current spending. However, the budget will include a request for
increased spending on the Strategic Defense Initiative to $4.8
billion, up from $3.8 billion this year.
   _A massive tree-planting program to help combat global warming
and an appeal to developers not to clear-cut new tracts but to
leave as many original trees standing as possible. Bush also has
promised support for elevating the Environmental Protection Agency
to Cabinet status.
   _Sharp cuts in a variety of energy-conservation programs,
including $350 million from a program that helps poor people pay
their heating bills and $161 million from one that helps them
weatherize their homes.
   _An increase in federal spending for education by $500 million
over this year's level of $24.1 billion _ but coupled with cuts in
the Pell Grant program that would knock 14,000 college students off
the rolls and cut stipends for another 1.3 million.
   _A new ``family savings account'' that would allow people to
earn tax-free interest and dividends on money that is squirreled
away for at least seven years _ with contributions of up to $5,000
per year per family.
   The 1,592-page budget document was in its final press run on
Friday, said Donna Alexander, a spokeswoman for the Government
Printing Office. Some 24,000 of the blue-jacketed documents are
being printed, and they will go on sale Monday at government
bookshops for $38 apiece.
   But even as the ink was drying on the final budgets to come off
the presses, a new government economic report raised fresh doubts
about the administration's assertions that the Bush budget would
lower the federal deficit to $64 billion, as required by the
Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law.
   The budget deficit was $152 billion last year and administration
economists estimate it will decline to around $100 billion this
year.
   The Commerce Department reported Friday that economic growth in
the last three months of 1989 had fallen to 0.5 percent when
adjusted for inflation, considerably worse than had been projected
by the Office of Management and Budget as it put together the
economic assumptions for the new budget.
   The budget to be released on Monday will project economic growth
for this year of 2.6 percent, even though the Congressional Budget
Office had issued a more pessimistic prediction of 1.8 percent.
   Slower growth has a direct impact on the budget deficit,
increasing it as revenues to the government fall. The Bush budget
also assumes declining interest rates, while interest rates in the
past few weeks have been inching up _ also potentially adding to
the deficit.
   The recent economic figures will make ``total hash'' of the
administration's claims that its spending outline _ which does not
contain any new taxes _ can significantly reduce the budget
deficit, said Michael Evans, president of a Washington-based
economic forecasting service.
   ``We're in the worst of all possible worlds. Interest rates are
going up, growth is going down,'' Evans said.
   Every 1 percent decline in growth, as measured by the gross
national product, raises the budget deficit by $15 billion. Every 1
percent rise in interest rates increases it by about $10 billion.
   Even before the GNP report, the bipartisan Congressional Budget
Office predicted the deficit this year would be $138 billion _ far
above the Bush forecast.
   Chief White House economist Michael Boskin argued that the
poorer-than-expected GNP showing would have only a modest impact on
the Bush budget. He said the administration would not revise its
forecasts at this time, in expectation that the economy would
rebound later this year. Still, he predicted a ``period of slower
growth.''

   The department released a copy of Palmer's statement in Budapest
that he was resigning to ``avoid any possible conflict of

Friday that Palmer would manage a consortium of financiers from the
United States and Canada that had bought a half-interest in a

   Palmer will leave Budapest next Wednesday. A career Foreign

<TEXT>
   A couple has sued a maker and retailer of
the diet supplement L-tryptophan, saying it gave the wife a rare
and painful blood disorder that required hospitalization and left
her unable to work.
   Federal officials suspect that contaminants in some batches of
the over-the-counter supplement caused the disorder in 1,000
Americans last year and have blamed the ailment for at least one
death. L-tryptophan, an enzyme, is sold as a natural sleeping aid.
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday by Louise and Donald Pangle, alleges
that she suffered rashes starting in September and later developed
muscle aches, nausea, weakness and other pain.
   Mrs. Pangle, 39, was hospitalized twice in November and has yet
to return to her job, said the Pangles' attorney, Joe Leman.
   The lawsuit Catoosa County Superior Court names Price Ringgold
Drugs of Ringgold and Nature's Bounty Inc. and Hudson Corp., both
of Bohemia, N.Y., as defendants, he said.
   It says the companies were negligent in the making, testing and
sale of the product and failed to warn the public about possible
dangers of taking the supplement, he said.
   The attorney said papers had yet to be served on the defendants,
and no hearing date has been set.
   Telephone calls Friday to Nature's Bounty went unanswered.
   Outbreaks of the disorder, eosinophillia-myalgia syndrome, first
appeared last year in New Mexico, afflicting more than 1,000
Americans.
   The Atlanta-based federal Centers for Disease Control says the
syndrome has caused at least one death and may be responsible for
as many as six.
   The disorder causes excessive levels of white blood cells.
   Researchers say people have used the substance for years without
reported problems. It was commonly sold in health food stores under
a variety of brand names until the outbreak, when most retailers
honored a recall request from the federal Food and Drug
Administration and removed it from the shelves.
   Scientists at the CDC and the FDA are trying to determine if the
disorder is caused by the product itself or by contaminants that
may have gotten into certain batches of it.

   Madge Bellamy, a silent screen star who
starred in such films as ``Lorna Doone'' and ``The Iron Horse,''
has died of chronic cardiac problems. She was 89.
   Miss Bellamy, whose last film appearance was in 1935, died
Wednesday at San Antonio Community Hospital, where she had been
admitted Jan. 10.
   She was born Margaret Philpott on June 30, 1900, in Hillsboro,
Texas, the daughter of Ann and William Philpott. Her father was a
professor of English at Texas A&amp;M University.
   She studied dance as a child, but a fractured ankle changed her
career and she began making stage appearances. Thousands knew her
for her role in the play ``Pollyanna.''
   In Hollywood, she starred in silent movies, including
``Alimony,'' ``Sandy,'' ``Lightnin','' ``The Golden Strain,''
``Bertha, the Sewing Machine Girl'' and ``Ankles Preferred.''
   In John Ford's ``The Iron Horse,'' she played the daughter of
the transcontinental railroad's chief contractor, who fell in love
with the lead actor, George O'Brien. In ``Lorna Doone,'' she was
the innocent aristocratic girl kidnapped and raised by bandits
before she was rescued by John Bowers.
   The Hollywood Foreign Correspondents Association named her
``American Beauty'' in 1928, the year she bought a 20-room mansion
for the then-astounding price of $200,000, and filled it with
another $100,000 worth of furnishings.
   Also that year, Miss Bellamy married Los Angeles broker Logan F.
Metcalf in Tijuana, Mexico. Three months later, he obtained a
divorce on a charge of cruelty, testifying they parted just four
days after the wedding.
   Her career began to falter with the advent of talking films, but
she appeared in ``White Zombie,'' a 1932 horror film starring Bela
Lugosi.
   She lived a solitary life in the Los Angeles suburb of Ontario
in her later years.
   She leaves no known relatives.

   Floods triggered by two days of heavy

animals are scattered along the riverbanks.''

   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland on Friday put
the power of his organization behind the free trade union movement
in the Soviet Union, and six visiting Soviet miners said they
wanted to follow the American lead.
   ``The Soviet miners have asked for our help. We intend to honor
that,'' Kirkland told a news conference that marked the end of a
monthlong visit and AFL-CIO training session for nine Soviets who
led the strike of 400,000 miners last summer. Three of the miners
were not at the news conference.
   Kirkland said his giant union, which supported Poland's
independent Solidarity union in its darkest days, would send the
fledgling Soviet movement medical supplies, communications
equipment and ``other materials that are essential to a trade union
organization.''
   The Soviet miners repeatedly thanked Kirkland and the union,
saying they would keep the American example in mind as they
struggled to build a federation of free unions from the scattered
groups they are trying to organize across the Soviet Union.
   ``In this work, the AFL is instructive,'' said Sergei A.
Naidyonov, a miner from the Donetsk Coal Basin in the Soviet
Ukraine, the largest Soviet coal producer and a center of the
strike last summer.
   The strike sparked a movement to create unions free of control
by the Communist Party and government. Official Soviet unions have
been sharply criticized by the AFL-CIO.
   ``We no longer want to feed the bureaucrats,'' Naidyonov said.
``We feel we have gained victory'' by starting independent unions.
   The coal strike and ensuing miners' demands for free trade
unions caught Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev by surprise and he
has sought unsuccessfully to persuade the legislature to ban
strikes.
   The Soviet miners invited the AFL-CIO to send a mission to the
Soviet Union, but Kirkland said Moscow authorities balked.
   ``We regret Moscow's refusal to allow an AFL-CIO delegation to
meet with independent trade unionists in the Soviet Union, and we
shall continue to hope that this barrier is a temporary one,''
Kirkland said.
   ``We expect the Soviet government's restrictions will not make
this endeavor an easy one, and we foresee considerable difficulty
ensuring that any material assistance we provide actually gets into
the hands of those for whom it is intended. But we will do our
best.''
   AFL-CIO aid to Solidarity, which continued even during the
1981-83 martial law crackdown against the movement, in many cases
involved smuggling material across borders, according to Polish
sources.
   The U.S. labor federation wants to repeat that success with the
Soviets, and took them to New York, Chicago, Denver, Pittsburgh,
and the picket lines of miners striking the McClure No. 1 Mine near
Abingdon, Va.
   Naidyonov said free trade unions were needed in the Soviet Union
because ``it was clear that the official trade unions were not
living up to expectations.''
   Naidyonov is a member of the Association of Socialist Trade
Unions, or Sotsprof, which he said was attempting to coordinate
among free labor groups organizing in the Soviet Union.
   ``Sotsprov is a horizontal structure,'' he said. ``It consists
of local committees'' and seeks to coordinate efforts nationwide.
Local groups include unions of miners, white collar workers,
journalists and others, he said

<TEXT>
   Two mine explosions on Friday hit a tank
and a military truck and wounded three Israeli soldiers in Israel's
self-designated security zone in south Lebanon, security sources
said.
   Israel radio said an officer was slightly wounded when the first
blast went off near the tank, which was headed toward an Israeli
post in the southern village of Baraachit.
   Five hours later, mine went off under an Israeli military truck
near Baraachit, wounding two Israeli soldiers, said the security
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   No immediate claim of responsibility was made.
   Baraachit, five miles north of the Israeli border, is near
Tibnin, where the headquarters of an Irish battalion serving with
the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon is based.
   Also Friday, a Palestinian guerrilla group issued communiques
saying it ambushed an Israeli army patrol in a narrow valley near
Taibeh inside the security zone in south Lebanon.
   The first communique from the Moscow-oriented Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine reported that an undisclosed number
of ``enemy soldiers'' were killed or injured. The second said nine
Israeli soldiers were killed or wounded in fighting that raged
until around noon.
   The Israeli army called the battle ``not a major incident,''
said its soldiers came under light arms fire and returned fire, and
denied any Israeli casualties.
   The Democratic Front said it was retaliating for an Israeli air
raid on Palestinian targets in south Lebanon Thursday. Police had
said one guerilla was killed and three were wounded in that air
strike.
   Israel has controlled the 6-to-10-mile-deep zone since 1985,
when it withdrew the bulk of its occupation army three years after
invading Lebanon.
   The zone runs from the Mediterranean coast to the foothills of
Mount Hermon and is used as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla
forays.

   Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife Elena were secretly
buried in Bucharest after their execution by firing squad last
month, Romania's vice premier said Friday on French television.
   The site of the graves of the former dictator and his wife have
``been kept secret to keep the population from losing
self-control,'' Gelu Voican said in an interview with the
television station La Cinq.
   The National Salvation Committee, which led the bloody revolt
against Ceausescu and now governs Romania, ordered Voican to
organize the secret tribunal that sentenced the couple to death, he
said.
   The Ceausescus were found guilty of murdering tens of thousands
of Romanian dissidents during their 24 years of harsh rule over the
Eastern European country.
   ``We were in a state of war, it was necessary to act quickly,''
said Voican, adding that had it been up to him he would have killed
the Ceausescus without a trial.
   The couple, tried in secret at the military base at Tergoviste,
attempted to flee from the courtyard as a military firing squad
took position to shoot them, Voican said.
   ``We were taking out the camera and the soldiers began firing
without any order being given,'' Voican said. ``There was a general
fusillade and the cameraman didn't have time to take the shot.''
   The only images released of the execution show the Ceausescus'
bullet-riddled bodies crumpled against a wall, covered with dust
Voican said was knocked from the stone by the hail of bullets.
   The bodies were taken to Bucharest and buried, Voican said.
   Voican said three soldiers were originally chosen to take part
in the firing squad but that ``the whole regiment'' ended up
shooting.
   In an interview published Monday in the French newspaper Le
Figaro, National Salvation Committee member Silviu Brucan was
quoted as saying 80 soldiers fired about 120 bullets into the
Ceausescus.

   There was no warning of the crash, said one passenger, Colombian
businessman Jorge Lozano. Suddenly, ``it was bumpy. The ladies and
kids were screaming.''
   ``I had time to say a prayer,'' said Lozano, who suffered a
cracked spine in the crash. ``I put my attache case over my knees
because I didn't have a pillow. I bent over in the crash position.
In about five seconds we were crashing into the trees.''
   The crash occurred 15 miles northeast of the airport. Scores of
emergency workers raced down narrow roads to the scene, where they
laid ladders up the steep wooded hillside and passed survivors down.
   ``What a way to come to America,'' one passenger told rescue
worker Jay Krul.
   The plane had been scheduled to land at 8 p.m. Diane Spitaliere,
an FAA spokeswoman, said the plane missed an approach at Kennedy at
9:24 p.m. She said she didn't know why the plane pulled away from
the airport.
   At 9:32 p.m., she said, the plane reported that its No. 2 engine
was out. At 9:34 p.m., the tower lost contact with the plane,
moments before the crash, Spitaliere said.
   A veteran Avianca pilot told The Associated Press in Colombia
that when the 707 gains altitude quickly after an aborted landing
while low on fuel, engines can shut down because the forces
generated push fuel to the back of the tanks. The pilot spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The AP's investigation source said investigators told him the
pilot notified the Kennedy tower that he was low on fuel before he
tried to land the first time. But he aborted the landing, telling
the tower he was having trouble with his No. 2 engine and that the
cloud ceiling was too low _ 200 feet.
   Other aviation sources who visited the scene and spoke on
condition that they not be identified said the Boeing 707 should
have been able to make its landing even if just one engine retained
fuel.
   The plane's voice and flight data recorders were recovered and
sent to Washington.
   No homes were hit in the crash, and there were no casualties on
the ground, though one part of the plane came to rest on a home's
patio.
   On board, there was pandemonium. ``There was a lot of screaming
and groaning around me,'' said Lozano, the Colombian businessman.
   ``There were bodies on top of bodies on top of bodies,'' said
Jeff Race, 26, a New York City Emergency Medical Services officer
who lives a half-mile away and said he was the first rescuer at the
scene. ``Some were alive, some were dead. Limbs were bent every way
you can imagine.''
   Among the injured were an undetermined number of children who
were bound for adoption in the United States. Cheryl Simon,
co-chairman of the Latin American Parents Association, which aids
people who want to adopt, said a new Colombian law made it more
difficult to bring children into the United States, and there was a
rush to beat the deadline.
   ``A lot of the kids we got out alive,'' said rescuer Charles
Harris. ``When you have a live kid in your hands, you just pray to
God that they will be OK. The most terrible thing is when you have
an injured mother crying, `My baby, my baby.'''
   The crash occurred a quarter mile from the home where the
parents of tennis pro John McEnroe live; their lawn was used as a
morgue, with at least 47 bodies wrapped in plastic and lined up in
rows.
   Flight 52 had made one stopover in Medellin, home of an
international cocaine cartel, and some speculated that drug-related
terrorism was involved in the crash. However, Matt Murphy, an agent
at the federal Drug Enforcement Administration office in New York,
said that was doubtful.
   Last Nov. 27, an Avianca Boeing 727 was bombed out of the sky
minutes after takeoff from Bogota on a domestic flight, killing all
107 people on board. Drug traffickers fearing extradition to the
United States claimed responsibility for the bombing.

   Jorge Lozano felt the flight turn bumpy.
   ``The ladies and kids started screaming,'' the 59-year-old
Bogota businessman recalled Friday, hours after he was rescued from
the wreckage of Avianca Flight 52. ``I thought we were going to
crash.
   ``I had time to say a prayer. I put my attache case over my
knees because I didn't have a pillow. I bent over in the crash
position. In about five seconds we were crashing into the trees.''
   The Boeing 707 plunged into a hillside Thursday night on the
north shore of Long Island, killing 72 people and injuring 89.
Lozano, a gray-haired man who works for the American Cargill grain
company in Bogota, escaped with a cracked vertebra, a gash on his
head and a swollen tongue.
   Whispering in English from his bed at North Shore University
Hospital, Lozano spoke about curious aspects of the disaster _ a
low pass over Kennedy Airport, a lack of communication from the
cockpit and the possibility that the jet ran out of gas.
   ``I'm so lucky,'' he said. ``My wife is flying in today to see
me from Bogota. When the whole thing ended, I saw a big hole. I
took my seat belt off. I slid down the hole. It was an opening in
the plane, right where I was. It was a miracle.''
   Lozano said Flight 52 was already running late when it reached
the fog-shrouded metropolitan area.
   ``We were told 20 minutes from landing that because of
congestion or airport conditions we were going to have an
additional 20 minutes before landing,'' said Lozano, who sat in
seat 4-F in the first class section.
   About 9:15 p.m. or 9:20, he said, ``we tried to land. We flew
low. I recognized the highways. I thought we were going to land. We
flew by _ apparently the runway was not visible. We went up,
circling very high. Then, 10 minutes later, it was bumpy.''
   And then, the screaming started.
   ``The pilot or stewardess didn't say a thing. I think the guy
ran out of gas,'' Lozano said. ``Inside, the lights went off.
Outside, the lights were off. But there was a little light inside
the plane. I guess it was run by battery.''
   Then came the impact. Residents heard no jet engines roaring and
there was no explosion. Authorities on the scene speculated the
plane had no fuel left.
   When the crashing stopped, the hole in the fuselage appeared.
But Lozano was stuck. ``I couldn't move,'' he said. The plane had
crashed onto a steep wooded slope, a few feet from a home.
   ``It took a long time, maybe 30 minutes. Then the firemen
came,'' he said. ``There were big lights. They were trying to
remove things.
   ``There was a lot of screaming and groaning around me. It took
them half an hour _ it seemed like an eternity. I was hoping people
would help this little girl, she was 18 years old. She was
screaming for her other, `Please help my mother, she's stuck under
the seat!'''
   Looking up, ``I saw people were being rescued on top of me. They
took me out and put me on the ground.''
   ``One of the men said, `This guy is much better than the
others.' I said, `That's correct. As long as you don't forget me,
you go and help the others.' I laid there, counting my blessings.
It was a miracle.''

<HEAD>Solidarity Caucus Calls for Disbanding Secret Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament deputies from Solidarity on
Friday called on the government to disband the secret police and
preserve its records following reports that police files were being
destroyed.
   ``The Security Service (secret police) was a basis of the
Stalinist system and its activity threatens the socio-political
stability of our state,'' a resolution passed by the Solidarity
caucus said.
   ``We appeal to the government for an immediate securing of its
operating materials and archives and for taking up action to
dissolve'' the service.
   A special parliament commission investigating the activities of
the Interior Ministry earlier complained that the records of a
secret police department investigating priests were destroyed.
   The Interior Ministry was one of the few departments that
remained under communist leadership after a Solidarity-led
coalition took control of the government in September.
   The resolution came the same day Solidarity's newspaper Gazeta
Wyborcza reported that men in an unidentified car had burned files
of the secret police Jan. 20 along a lake near Starachowice in
southern Poland.
   Among the ashes were partly burned documents bearing stamps of
the Security Service, which is part of the Interior Ministry, the
paper said.
   There have been dozens of other reports of similar activity
around the country, the paper said.
   Meanwhile, television news reported that in Krakow communist
party records have been burned the past several days in meadows
along the Vistula River and that the party files in Bialystok in
northeastern Poland were also burned.

   Black activists ran through this
mining city smashing car and shop windows to protest an English
cricket team that began its first match Friday despite a ban on
sports contacts with South Africa.
   The ban stems from South Africa's apartheid policies of racial
segregation.
   Police said 31 youths were arrested Friday and reported that a
52-year-old man was injured by the protesters.
   Hundreds of demonstrators tried to protest outside the De Beers
Club stadium where the match was being played, but police set up a
roadblock about a half-mile from the stadium, witnesses said.
   Crowd estimates ranged from 300 to 4,000.
   Two busloads of protesters coming from the Johannesburg area
were turned back en route by police.
   Protest leaders in Kimberly met with Ali Bacher, managing
director of the South African Cricket Union, and demanded they be
allowed to march on the stadium.
   Bacher, who organized the English tour, agreed. However, police
still refused to allow the protesters near the stadium, where the
English squad began a three-day match against players from two Cape
Province teams.
   After negotiations failed, some protesters began running toward
town carrying sticks and stones, breaking car windows along the
way, witnesses said.
   Police dispersed the crowd at the roadblock, pursued the
demonstrators running through town and arrested several youths,
witnesses added.
   Bacher, who has been seeking to minimize conflict related to the
tour, later went to a local magistrate and obtained his approval
for a protest to be held outside the cricket stadium on Saturday.
   All the English players face expulsion from international
cricket for five years for taking part in the tour.
   Activists have said they will stage protests throughout the
six-week visit by the English team. Protests have been held outside
the hotels where the players have been staying in Johannesburg and
Kimberley.
   Black hotel workers refused to serve the British players and
demanded that other hotel guests produce identification showing
they are not part of the team.
   The English players have not said how much they are being paid
for the tour, but local newspapers have put the figure at $160,000
each.

   Fifty-eight countries signed a U.N.
protocol on children's rights at a ceremony Friday as part of
efforts to establish an international treaty to protect youth
worldwide.
   Signing indicates a government's intent to consider ratifying
the Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted by the U.N.
General Assembly in November. Twenty countries must ratify the
convention to give it the force of an international treaty.
   James P. Grant, executive director of the U.N. Children's Fund,
said, ``In creating this convention, the international community
has provided a firm foundation for a new ethic for children, an
ethic that defines children as individuals with inalienable rights
of no less value than those of adults.''
   The convention stresses the importance of primary health care
and education, and recommends measures to guard against child
labor, sexual exploitation and drug abuse. It sets up steps to
protect children in cases of adoption, foster care and juvenile
justice proceedings.
   A UNICEF report issued last month said spending by Third World
countries on armaments and debt service rather than health and
nutrition could doom 100 million children to death by disease and
starvation in the 1990s.
   The report said that almost 8,000 children die each day because
they are not immunized. Nearly 7,000 die daily from dehydration
caused by diarrhea, and about 6,000 are killed each day by
pneumonia.
   The cost of immunizing all these children and providing
medicines for dehydration and pneumonia would be about $2.5 billion
a year, it adds.

   The crew of a Colombian jetliner warned
controllers repeatedly they wer running out of fuel before the
Boeing 707 crashed on its second approach to Kennedy Airport,
killing 72 people, investigators said Friday.
   Avianca Airlines Flight 52 from Bogota had been delayed by air
traffic and appeared to have barely enough fuel to land before it
slashed into a suburban hillside Thursday night, officials said.
The jet may have lost power in three of its four engines before it
went down.
   The plane's crew, however, never declared an emergency or
requested an emergency landing priority, Lee Dickinson, spokesman
for the National Transportation Safety Board, said at a Friday
evening news conference.
   Eighty-nine people survived the crash and 72 died, including the
entire nine-member crew except for the chief steward, Dickinson
said. Only nine victims had been positively identified, he said.
The Boeing 707 carried 152 passengers.
   Hospital officials said at least 25 of the injured were in
serious or critical condition, and more than two dozen children
were among the injured.
   Some of the children were being adopted by American parents and
were making their first trips to their new homes.
   Investigators picking through the wreckage of the jet in the
woods of this isolated, wealthy suburb found gauges indicating it
had 10,000 pounds of fuel left, Dickinson said. That corresponds to
about 6 percent of the plane's capacity. Investigators had not
checked the actual tanks, he said.
   After aborting their first attempt at landing, the cockpit crew
told the control tower repeatedly that ``they were running out of
fuel or that they were low on fuel,'' Dickinson said.
   In Seattle, Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Jack Gamble
said the 10,000 pounds would have been roughly the amount the jet
needed to get to the airport, ``but not much more.''
   Gamble said 10,000 pounds equals about 1,500 gallons, ``enough
to land an airplane when it's three to five minutes out'' from the
field and the plane is in a normal landing configuration. A 707 can
carry up to 23,855 gallons.
   Three to five minutes flight time equals about 17 miles in a
landing configuration, Gamble said. The Avianca jetliner, nearing
the end of a 2,400-mile flight, crashed about 15 miles northeast of
the airport.
   Dickinson said investigators flew over the site early Friday and
determined the wreckage was on course for another Kennedy approach.
In addition, the landing gear was up and the flaps were ``somewhere
between fully extended and retracted ... indicating that the
airplane was in some phase of approach,'' he said.
   Before the crash, the plane was put in a holding pattern over
Norfolk, Va., and New Jersey for 75 minutes, NBC News reported.
Dickinson and an FAA spokeswoman said they could not confirm that.
   When it finally reached Kennedy International Airport, the
jetliner was forced to abort an initial landing in fog and rain
because of warnings that it was ``sinking too fast'' _ descending
too quickly and at the wrong angle, Dickinson said.
   It was making a second approach shortly after 9:30 p.m. when the
crew reported to the airport tower that it was having trouble with
its number two engine. The crew then reported two engines out, and
shortly thereafter the jet disappeared from the radar screens,
Dickinson said.
   Prior to the first landing attempt, the pilot, Laureano
Caviedes, told passengers that because of heavy air traffic at JFK,
the plane would have to circle for 20 minutes, according to
statements by one witness.
   ``But the plane spent more than an hour circling in high winds,
heavy rain and incredible air pockets,'' said Marisol Velasco, a
Colombian residing in New York City, in an telephone interview with
Caracol, a Colombian radio network.
   ``The plane rose and fell, and nobody had told us anything when
suddenly the lights went out. The plane descended and we felt the
biggest impact in the world,'' he said.
   Earlier in the day, a source close to the investigation who
spoke on condition of anonymity told The Associated Press that
authorities had compiled evidence indicating the plane may have run
out of fuel. There was no fire on impact, and the landing was a
low-impact, low-speed crash, suggesting that the plane glided to
the ground. Also, there was no fuel smell, and the nose, wings and
body came down level instead of thrusting forward, as they would
have if the engines were running.
   In addition, witnesses said there was no explosion when the
jetliner crumpled into several pieces in the woods.
   Dickinson also said there were indications that three engines
were not working when the plane crashed. The fourth engine, buried
in mud at the crash site, has not yet been inspected.
   The Colombian radio network RCN reported that the 23-year-old
plane had been plagued by mechanical problems recently, having been
sent to the maintenance shop 37 times in the past four months. The
radio didn't say what the maintenance was for.
   An Avianca spokeswoman in Colombia identified the cockpit crew:
pilot Laureano Caviedes, 52, who had flown for the airline since
1962; copilot Mauricio Klotz, 27, with the company 3{ years, and
flight engineer Matias Moyano Rojas, 44, a 24-year Avianca veteran.
   One of those injured, a 30-year-old man, was found by doctors to
have four condoms packed with a white powder they speculated was
cocaine in his intestines.

<TEXT>
   Two former Air Force base security
policemen who pleaded guilty to stealing three fighter jet engines
worth nearly $10 million were sentenced Friday to federal prison
terms.
   The case grew from ``Operation Punchout,'' a two-year Pentagon
investigation of thefts from bases in the West and Southwest that
resulted in charges against nearly three dozen military personnel
and civilians.
   Undercover agents running a phony military surplus business in
the town of Roy, outside Hill Air Force Base, bought millions of
dollars worth of stolen military hardware over the two-year period,
including the three engines for F-16 fighter jets.
   U.S. District Judge David Sam sentenced Airman 1st Class Brian
David Roth, 23, to 10 years on each of five counts of theft of
government property. The terms are to be served concurrently.
   In addition, the judge ordered Roth, of Chesterfield, Ohio, to
pay $24,749.50 in restitution, and placed him on three years'
probation following completion of his prison sentence.
   Senior Airman Danny Joe Stroud, 24, Newton, Kan., was sentenced
to 37 months in prison, ordered to pay $14,711 in restitution and
given three years probation. Stroud pleaded guilty to a single
count of theft.
   Under a plea bargain last October, government prosecutors agreed
to drop 17 of the 22 original charges against Roth.
   Roth's lawyer, Jerold McPhee, argued that while his client had
committed a serious crime, ``it is only a theft of government
property, albeit a lot of government property. ... This is not a
case of treason.''
   Roth apologized for the crimes, saying his involvement in the
thefts began when he accidentally was issued two sets of basic
equipment at Hill, and decided to sell his extra helmet. As time
went on, his thievery escalated, he said.
   ``I am not sorry I got caught. I only wish it had ended
sooner,'' Roth said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Lubeck argued for a stiff sentence
for Roth, noting that the theft of the F-16 engines _ valued at
$9.9 million _ caused a ``monumental disruption'' of operations at
the northern Utah base. He said Roth was guilty of an ``aggravated
abuse of trust.''
   Stroud's attorney, Stephen Madsen, said his client was a
follower, recruited into crime by Roth. He said he had been
involved in thefts less than a month at the time of his arrest July
10, 1988, and cooperated extensively with government lawyers.

<HEAD>Fan Blade Crack Blamed for Northwest Airlines Mishap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board said
Friday that a fan blade crack one-third of an inch-long introduced
during a repair process was to blame for forcing a Northwest
Airlines DC-10 to make an emergency landing in Denver in August.
   The blade broke away and fragments punctured the left fan cowl
in three places and partially penetrated the plane's vertical
stabilizer, the NTSB said. The crew shut down the engine. The
plane, en route from Los Angeles to Minneapolis, landed safely.
   ``Metallurgical examination revealed that the blade separation
had stemmed from a 0.34-inch-long fatigue crack that began in a
weld adjacent to a patch at the trailing edge of the fan blade,''
the report said.
   ``The examination indicated that the fatigue crack had
originated from a small, about 0.03-inch deep, discolored crack
region introduced during the repair process.''
   The discoloration was so obvious, the report said, that the
crack should have been detected during the repair process.
   The blade had been ``patch-repaired'' by Union Carbide Corp. in
Kansas City, the board said.
   ``The safety board is concerned that other (Pratt &amp; Whitney) fan
blades patch-repaired by Union Carbide may have similar or even
smaller cracks that were introduced during patch repair and that
these cracks could grow by fatigue in service, producing blade
separation and resulting in personal injury, loss of life and
substantial damage to the airplane and engine components,'' the
board said.
   It recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration require
a one-time eddy current inspection of all such patch-repaired
blades and, if needed, recurring inspections ``capable of detecting
a propagating fatigue crack before it reaches a critical length.''
   Robert Berzok, Union Carbide's chief spokesman, said the
Danbury, Conn.-based company had been working with federal
authorities, Pratt &amp; Whitney and its airline customers since August
to inspect the more than 1,000 fan blades repaired at the Kansas
City facility.
   He said more than 90 percent of the blades had been inspected
and the remainder fell in a ``very low-risk category.''

<TEXT>
   The last leg of Avianca Flight 52 disintegrated
into a series of delays, ominous weather reports and increasing
fuel worries, followed by abrupt silence, according to
investigators and news reports.
   Cockpit voice recordings analyzed Friday show the flight crew
reported several times that the plane was running out of fuel
before it crashed Thursday night on Long Island, 15 miles short of
Kennedy International Airport.
   Also Friday, NBC News reported the flight was delayed three
times as it flew up the East Coast, being placed in holding
patterns once above Norfolk, Va., and twice over New Jersey. The
delays totaled 75 minutes _ so long that when the pilot was asked
if he could be diverted to Logan Airport in Boston to avoid the bad
weather, he said he didn't have enough fuel to make it there, NBC
said.
   At that point, controllers ordered the plane directly to
Kennedy, NBC said.
   Officials of the National Transportation Board, which is
investigating the crash, refused to comment on the NBC report.
   Lee Dickinson, an NTSB member, released information obtained
from a preliminary analysis of the cockpit voice recording. The
recorder continually monitors conversations, preserving the last 30
minutes.
   Early in the tape, ``there is some conversation among the crew
about the fuel'' in the plane, Dickinson said.
   A short while after the first reference to the fuel shortage,
the crew was told as the plane approached Kennedy that there were
reports of wind shear _ powerful downward bursts of wind _ at
altitudes of 1,600 feet to 500 feet.
   On the final approach to the airport, an alarm warned the crew
the plane was losing altitude too quickly and was at an improper
angle for a safe landing, Dickinson said.
   The alarm repeatedly warned, ``Pull Up! Pull Up!,'' followed by
another warning that the plane was sinking too fast, he said.
   The crew aborted its landing approach and asked the air traffic
controller for permission to try again.
   ``They said they would try again but they were running out of
fuel or they were low on fuel,'' Dickinson said.
   The tower gave directions for a second approach and the crew
repeated that the plane was running low on fuel.
   Traffic controllers again gave them directions ``and asked them
if that was OK and the crew responded OK,'' Dickinson said.
   Shortly after that exchange the crew reported two engines had
shut down.
   The tape ended abruptly after that, but before the crash.
Several NTSB officials said the recorder would have stopped
recording if power in the airplane had been shut off. Several
survivors have said all lights were shut off before the crash at
9:34 p.m.

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor said Thursday that a woman
accused of killing her 6-week-old infant in April has lied under
oath by changing her story about a masked gunman who allegedly
attacked and stole her baby.
   Paula Marie Sims, 30, testified Wednesday that the same gunman
who stole her first-born daughter, Loralei Marie, from her home in
1986, also attacked her and abducted her 6-week-old daughter
Heather Lee last year.
   Assistant state attorney Donald Weber Thursday accused Mrs. Sims
of changing her original account of the April abduction and slaying
of the infant to neutralize what could be damaging testimony by a
medical expert.
   Weber said Mrs. Sims lied about the time the attack occurred
because the expert, a medical examiner, said it would have been
impossible for her to remember much about the incident if she had
been knocked unconscious for 45 minutes, as she told police.
   ``She's changing her story as she goes,'' Weber said during
rebuttal arguments. ``She has specifically added facts to her
testimony and the defense is trying to prevent me from proving her
to be a liar.''
   In Wednesday's testimony, Mrs. Sims said she was knocked
unconscious for at least 15 minutes less than she said in her
original account. That meant her ability to recall events most
likely would be clearer, according to the medical examiner's
testimony.
   Mrs. Sims is charged with first-degree murder of Heather Lee,
and has been charged in a separate indictment with obstructing
justice and concealing the homicide of her other daughter. No
murder charges have been filed in that case.

<HEAD>Czech Gun Permits Suspended to Disarm Secret Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All gun permits will be suspended
next week in an effort to disarm old-guard remnants of the secret
force who still hold weapons, the state news agency CTK reported
Thursday.
   It also reported a gun amnesty, quoting an official report as
saying that ``all citizens holding guns illegally are asked to hand
their weapons over voluntarily. Such cases will not be considered
as misdemeanors or criminal acts.''
   CTK said, ``To avoid possible cases of abuse of firearms for
criminal activity and to strengthen the safety of citizens,
Interior Minister Richard Sacher ... suspended the validity of gun
permits as of Feb. 2, 199O.
   ``This measure applies also to members of the ... departments of
internal political service of the State Security, who will hand
their weapons to their designated superiors.''
   Sacher suspended all officers of the Security Service's internal
political service last week, and said new superiors would be
appointed from the ranks of non-discredited police force members.
   The service was a dread instrument of the state under the
Communist regime that ruled Czechoslovakia for more than four
decades until last month.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Jan Valsa told The Associated Press
that besides citizens with private gun permits, the new measure
will also apply to regular police and even soldiers, should they
have firearms at home.
   ``In the next few days the Interior Ministry will submit to the
Parliament a draft law on firearms and ammunition, which will
envisage a much stricter procedure in issuing gun permits,'' CTK
said.
   The penalty for illegal posession of a firearm is three years,
and that for posessing more than one gun five years.

<HEAD>Defectors Report Protest Demonstrations in Albania</HEAD>

   Four Albanian defectors said
Thursday that anti-Communist protests were held this month in their
hometown of Shkoder and police broke up one rally with clubs and
tear gas, Tanjug news agency said.
   The defectors said thousands of people tried to tear down a
downtown statue of Josef Stalin during the protests on Jan. 11 and
14 in Shkoder, Albania's second largest city near the Yugoslav
border.
   ``The destruction of the statue would symbolize the destruction
of the current regime in Albania,'' one of the men told Tanjug.
   The four, two workers and two high school students, escaped to
Yugoslavia from their isolated country on Wednesday over the
heavily guarded border. They were not identified by name.
   They told Tanjug that police did not make arrests or use force
to disperse about 2,000 demonstrators during the Jan. 11 protest,
but on Jan. 14, police fired tear gas and swung clubs to disperse
up to 7,000 people who had gathered around Stalin's statue.
   About 60 demonstrators were detained and arrests continued for
the next couple of days ``since the police filmed the Jan. 14
protest,'' they said.
   The defectors said ``the Albanian people expect radical changes
to take place in their country this spring,'' but did not elaborate.
   They said they fled to Yugoslavia because they could not stand
the ``regime, poverty and hopelessness of life in Albania,''
according to Tanjug.
   Yugoslav, Greek and other Western media have published reports
of recent unrest in Albania, the last Stalinist stronghold in
Eastern Europe. The reports could not be independently confirmed as
few foreigners are allowed to enter the Balkan country.
   Albanian officials have denied the allegations.

   The family of Carol Stuart on Thursday announced a
scholarship fund in her memory to aid residents in the inner-city
neighborhood who were put under an unfair cloud of suspicion when
she was killed.
   The DiMaiti family said they want their daughter to be
remembered as more than just the victim of a sensational murder.
They also said they hope to begin a healing process in Mission
Hill, where she was fatally shot Oct. 23 in a hoax that shocked the
country.
   The announcement was welcomed by some black leaders who have
complained that police and the media were too willing to believe
the claim of Mrs. Stuart's husband, Charles, that the couple was
shot by a black mugger. Charles Stuart committed suicide after he
was implicated in the crime.
   In a less conciliatory development, black state legislators
announced a bill Thursday that would establish a special commission
to investigate police work in the case.
   The commission, which would have limited subpoena power, would
examine how police built a case against William Bennett, a black
man included in a lineup who has since been exonerated. The panel
also would try to determine where the media got information about
Bennett.
   The commission wouldn't interfere with the criminal
investigation, but would examine why police focused on a black
suspect and failed to investigate the husband earlier in the case,
said state Rep. Byron Rushing, a Boston Democrat who sponsored the
measure.
   ``How did that idea last as the only valid proposition for about
two and a half months?'' Rushing said.
   Immediately following the televised announcement of the
scholarship fund, more than 40 people telephoned the DiMaiti
family's lawyer and offered to donate money to the Carol DiMaiti
Stuart Foundation.
   Giusto DiMaiti, 64, read a brief statement to reporters, choking
up during the end of his remarks. It was his first public comment
on his daughter's death since the disclosure of the hoax Jan. 4.
   ``She was truly the brightest of lights in our lives,'' said
DiMaiti. ``She will always and forever be with us. ... Mere words
cannot express the emptiness we feel or how much we miss her.''
   His wife, Evelyn, 62, and son Carl, 37, attended the news
conference but did not speak. DiMaiti clutched his wife's hand and
Mrs. DiMaiti dabbed at her eyes as their lawyers took questions
from reporters.
   The fund was established for residents of Mission Hill, where a
massive manhunt was launched after Stuart claimed a black mugger
had shot him and his 30-year-old, pregnant wife.
   The case drew wide attention and the badly wounded Stuart's
dramatic call for help on his car telephone was broadcast
nationally. His wife died hours later after their son lived just 17
days after being delivered by Caesarean section. Ten weeks after
the shootings, Stuart apparently committed suicide after one of his
brothers implicated him in the shootings.
   In announcing the scholarship, attorney Marvin Geller recalled
the ``old scars of racial tension'' opened by the hoax.
   ``The DiMaiti family believes that Carol would not have wanted
her death to be remembered as the cause of such divisiveness,'' he
said. ``(Carol) would not have wanted to be remembered as a victim
of a sensational murder.''
   Black leaders in Boston applauded the announcement but tempered
their remarks with lingering concerns about the damage done Mission
Hill's residents.
   ``I think it's a magnanimous gesture on their part ...,'' said
Louis Elisa, president of the Boston chapter of the NAACP. ``Maybe
they can prevail on the mayor to make an apology so the real
healing can start.''
   Another attorney, John Wortmann Jr., said Carol's parents never
suspected their son-in-law prior to his death. He said their
concerns were no more than ``the doubts that any parent would have
about whether anybody is good enough for their daughter.''
   He said the family had no desire that anyone else be prosecuted
in the case, ``only that justice and the truth come out.'' Wortmann
wouldn't elaborate.
   One of Stuart's brothers, Matthew, has acknowledged getting rid
of the gun, but says he didn't know at the time that Mrs. Stuart
had been shot with it. It was Matthew who finally went to police
Jan. 3. Another Stuart brother, Michael, has said he learned of
Charles Stuart's involvement in the crime within days but said
nothing.
   Wortmann said there had been informal contact between the
DiMaiti and Stuart families in recent weeks, but declined to
elaborate.
   He also said the DiMaiti family has made no arrangements to
cooperate on book or movie projects. He said the family knows books
and movies will be made about the case, and hope they ``will not
denigrate the memory of Carol Stuart.''

   ``M. Butterfly,'' the drama by David Henry Hwang

   ``Business has not improved and the advance sale for the next

<HEAD>Blizzard Belts Midwest with Snow, Wind, Lightning</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A blizzard belted the upper Midwest with up to 10 inches of snow
Thursday, packing high winds that ripped roofs off buildings in
Michigan and lightning that injured 12 people in Illinois.
   In severe weather elsewhere, a tornado tore through a trailer
park in Centenary, Ala., injuring 24 people.
   The snowstorm brought traffic to a standstill in parts of
Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa and Indiana. Storm warnings for
snow and high wind remained in effect into the night in some areas.
   Airline flights were delayed up to two hours at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport and Midway Airport because of blowing snow
and high wind, said Lisa Howard, a spokeswoman for the city
Department of Aviation.
   ``This is a red alert storm,'' Ms. Howard said. ``Things are at
a standstill.''
   The weather also caused scattered power outages and temporarily
closed airports in Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Detroit.
   In Crystal Lake, Ill., 35 miles northwest of Chicago, a
lightning bolt struck a telephone pole and was conducted through
snow across a parking lot, injuring 11 people. Two were in serious
condition.
   Workers at Precision Twist Drill Co. were trying to help each
other free their cars from six inches of snow that fell overnight
when the bolt struck at 8:30 a.m., said Art Beck, company president.
   ``There were sparks coming through their fingers,'' Beck said of
the injured.
   Lightning also struck a woman's umbrella in the Chicago suburb
of Palatine, slightly injuring her as she was on her way to work at
William Rainey Harper College, said school spokeswoman Elaine
Stoermer.
   Wind up to 60 mph peeled roofs off buildings and uprooted trees
in southeast Michigan.
   In Auburn Hills, just north of Detroit, wind tore the roof off
one of three Headquarters Motel buildings. No one was injured.
   ``Several other buildings in the area lost parts of their roofs,
but the motel lost the whole thing. It's open air,'' said Auburn
Hills police Sgt. Jerry Knapp.
   In Ohio, two U.S. marshals were injured when a tree fell on
their car as they were returning from a firing range near Toledo.
One, David Hartzel, was in serious condition at Flower Memorial
Hospital in suburban Sylvania with head injuries.
   Winds gusting to 50 mph in downtown Indianapolis blew out
windows from the 21st and 36th floors of the INB National Bank
Tower, injuring a 54-year-old woman who received a cut on her right
thigh from falling glass.
   Farther south in Centenary, Ala., a tornado flipped or split
open a dozen mobile homes at about 5:30 a.m., strewing furniture,
clothes, toys and pink insulation about the area 40 miles south of
Montgomery.
   Among the injured was a boy rescued by a man who lifted the
corner of a shattered mobile home that pinned him, witnesses said.
   Of the 24 people hospitalized, three were children with serious
head injuries, said Nancy Williams, spokeswoman for the county
hospital.
   The Midwest blizzard was blamed for many minor accidents as cars
slid off snow-covered roads, and many people simply stayed home.
   Illinois state police closed 35- to 40-mile stretches of
Interstate 90 near Elgin and I-88 outside Aurora for two hours
beginning at 11:30 a.m., said Sgt. Tami Haukedahl.
   In Michigan's northern Lower Peninsula schools and businesses
closed early, cars and buses slid off the roads and even snow plows
got stuck.
   ``We're losing ground at this point,'' said Wexford County road
engineer Pat McCormick in Cadillac. ``We're making the way clear
for school buses where we can. They're stuck all over the place.''
   The storm lashed southeast Iowa with 45 mph winds that whipped 5
inches of snow into a treacherous near-whiteout on roads slick with
ice.
   ``Not only is there zero visibility, but you can turn left and
not go left,'' said Bob Wilson, district manager for the American
Automobile Association's Motor Club of Iowa. ``People could die out
there.''

<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former CBS News president Richard S. Salant on
Thursday criticized the relatively new trend of sending network
anchormen overseas to make their newscasts where big news is
breaking.
   ABC ``Nightline'' anchor Ted Koppel said he agreed with Salant's
complaints, but that such actions were necessary because ``the
anchors are the ones who in very large measure are perceived as
bringing in the audience.''
   The two appeared at a duPont-Columbia University forum on
network news, along with former NBC News president Les Crystal, now
executive producer of PBS ``MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' and NBC News
vice president Tim Russert.
   Salant, referring to network anchormens' trips last year to
Eastern Europe and West Germany when the Berlin Wall was being
demolished, said he's against such trips, known in network news
circles as ``bigfooting'' a story.
   Network news divisions may consider it important, ``but I don't
like this business of it not being an important story unless you
get the anchor there,'' said Salant, who retired from CBS in 1978.
   It's better to use correspondents who know the territory and
have long experience covering the story, he said, drawing chuckles
by joking that ``the (Berlin) Wall doesn't go down unless the
anchors are there.''
   Salant, who didn't single out any anchorman for criticism, cited
what he said was a large staff CBS sent to West Berlin for Dan
Rather's newscasts there. ``It costs more to do that, but I think
it's money ill spent,'' he said.
   Koppel wrly noted that he's going to South Africa this year to
anchor his program from there and that he hoped ``it will be money
well spent.''
   In an age of cable news and satellite, when network newscasts
are fighting far stronger competition than ever before, it's
important to have someone to whom viewers are loyal, Koppel said.
   In this new era, Koppel said, ``having that familiar face _
Peter Jennings, Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw _ is the only thing that now
distinguishes the networks in the eyes of many people, many
viewers. ...
   ``It is the familiarity with an anchor that you've known for
ten, 15, 20 years.''

   President Bush, savoring a major triumph over
Congress, is claiming a mandate to deal with China ``the way I feel
is correct'' despite widespread opposition to his policies from
Democrats and Republicans alike.
   ``Surprised you, didn't it?'' Bush exclaimed Thursday after the
Senate, by a four-vote margin, upheld his veto of a politically
popular bill protecting Chinese students from deportation.
   Bush said the victory would ``be helpful in reaching
accommodation'' with the Senate and House on other matters.
   Senators voted 62-37 against Bush but the vote failed to meet
the two-thirds margin needed for an override. The House had voted
390-25 a day earlier against the president.

   A storm with winds of up to 110 mph tore across
southern England and Western Europe, killing at least 64 people in
five countries as it ripped off roofs, caused buildings to cave in
and brought trees crashing down on cars and pedestrians.
   Britain, with 41 dead, was the worst hit Thursday. ``London is
virtually at a standstill,'' Scotland Yard said as air, bus, subway
and train services halted and rain came through the wind-damaged
roof of Parliament.
   Police reports said 11 people died in Holland, six in France,
five in Belgium and one in West Germany.
   The storm swep in from the Atlantic Thursday morning, cutting a
trail of destruction across the continent before turning northeast
and heading out into the North Sea at night.

   Some lawmakers are reacting cautiously to
President Bush's proposed $1 billion aid plan for Panama, with one
senator saying Congress wants to help the country but predicting a
``tough battle'' on how much to give.
   ``That's a substantial amount of money for a tiny country,''
said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., echoing questions that others also
raised about the amount Bush is proposing for the country he
ordered the U.S. military to invade on Dec. 20.
   ``Where's it going to come from?'' asked Rep. Peter Kostmayer,
D-Pa., a member of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
Western Hemispheric affairs. ``It's too much.''
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger planned to
provide additional details of the plan to senators today, the day
after Bush unveiled it. To spend the money, the administration must
submit a supplemental appropriation requiring congressional
approval.

   President Bush's nominee to become the Justice
Department's civil rights chief acknowledges he lacks broad
experience on the issue but says he has an ``understanding and a
sensitivity'' about civil rights.
   Former New York state Sen. John R. Dunne was nominated Thursday
by Bush to be assistant attorney general for civil rights, a post
that has been vacant since December 1988. Bush's first choice,
William Lucas, failed to win Senate confirmation last August.
   Dunne, 59, of Garden City, N.Y., spent 24 years in the New York
state Senate, where he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He
resigned in September after losing a battle for Republican majority
leader and is currently a partner in a Long Island law firm.
   On the eve of his nomination, Dunne acknowledged: ``I haven't
had as much experience as I'm sure many civil rights activists
perhaps would like to see.''

<HEAD>Valerie Harper's New CBS Sitcom a No-Ho.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fans of ``The Famous Teddy Z'' may demand a
recount. CBS temporarily took it off the air to make room for
Valerie Harper's new sitcom, ``City,'' which makes its premiere
tonight. The move does not seem wise.
   ``City,'' where Harper plays Liz Gianni, the harried city
manager presiding over a colorful staff in one of television's many
towns with no names, is somewhat to the left of whoopee.
   It's not just because the show has an off-screen announcer
intone: ``In every city, there is a handful of unsung heroes that
make the city run. Underappreciated, overworked, underpaid, they
are ... The Bureaucrats.''
   Nor is it because our single heroine has one of the old
reliables of sitcoms, a 19-year-old daughter (some shows co-star
kid sisters to vary things) who has dropped out of college and come
to live with her.
   Or even because the staff worries about Liz's sex life (it's not
clear if Liz is widowed, divorced, or what have you). One of her
crew, noting Liz has a date with a councilman coming up, cheerfully
says, ``Hey, Miss Gianni _ hope you score tonight.''
   It's just that the whole show kind of falls down and goes boom.
This usually indicates that succeeding episodes may do likewise.
   With LuAnne Ponce as Harper's mischievous daughter, tonight's
debut, foaled by executive producer Paul Hagguis, offers Harper two
crises.
   One is the daughter's announcement she is thinking of having sex
with a married man whose name she doesn't know. The other is a
bunch of coffins that have slid down a hill into the city. It seems
they accidentally were exhumed by a bulldozer rooting around in
what is described as ``an abandoned cemetery.''
   The coffin caper touches off an emergency meeting at Harper's
rundown city hall office. This, of course, lets viewers meet her
mildly zany staff and the city's dim, obnoxious, easily bribed
deputy mayor.
   Raising a point of disorder at the meeting, a Cuban-born
bureaucrat (Liz Torres) says Americans don't appreciate freedom and
that her husband ``rots in a Cuban jail'' just because he fought
for freedom.
   The assistant city manager (Todd Sussman) scoffs: ``Your husband
was caught smuggling in 40 crates of Teddy Ruxpin dolls from
Florida.''
   ``When the CIA asks for a favor, you don't ask why,'' says she.
   With snappy patter like this, all one can do is pray for the
players, and note that two of them provide the only good moments,
salvaging dead lines with fine timing and sly performances.
   Those two are James Lorinz, excellent in a small part as the
young security chief of city hall, and Sussman.
   The performance of Harper, who last starred on CBS in ``Rhoda,''
a spin-off of ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' is up to her usual
standards. But she doesn't seem at ease in ``City.''
   That is understandable, given the quality of tonight's script.
The whole thing is best summed up in a line by the daughter, who
says, ``I sort of need to flounder around a while to try to find
out what I want.''
   With CBS trying to avoid a third season in the Nielsen cellar,
``City'' had best find out what it wants, and swiftly. CBS can't
afford to let it flounder _ you know what happens when any dead
fish is left around too long.

   The plea came crackling over two-way
radios in the predawn hours of Feb. 2, 1980: ``You all stop killing
each other. There's blood all over. ... No more killing. No more
hurting.''
   It was merely a hint of the horror going on inside New Mexico's
only maximum security prison after inmates seized control. Some
prisoners were systematically and brutally murdering others;
officials later said they were settling personal grudges against
informers.
   When it was over, 33 inmates were dead _ the worst prison riot
in the United States since the 1971 Attica rebellion in New York
that left 43 dead.
   The rebellion exposed an inadequate and mismanaged prison system
run by an insufficient number of poorly trained, underpaid and
sometimes abusive guards in a facility overflowing with frustrated
criminals.
   In the decade since, the state has spent $127.5 million building
prisons, and training for guards has been improved. Since 1980, the
prison system has been operated under a federal court decree
covering 13 broad areas of prison life.
   The uprising began at 2 a.m. that Saturday 10 years ago when
inmates beat and overpowered three unarmed guards. Within seconds,
the convicts had smashed the newly installed and supposedly
unbreakable tempered glass around the prison control room, gaining
control of internal locks and communications.
   Fifteen minutes later, Gov. Bruce King's security men notified
him that the lights were off at the penitentiary and that there was
no response from 15 corrections officers inside.
   King ordered the state police to take up positions outside the
prison, where they were joined a few hours later by the National
Guard.
   For 36 hours, the inmates controlled the prison, which was built
to house 850 prisoners but held more than 1,130. They burned most
of the penitentiary buildings, destroyed records, terrorized their
hostages, and beat and raped other prisoners.
   State medical examiner Dr. James Weston, whose office autopsied
the dead, later said most of the bodies had been mutilated and some
had ``injuries suggesting torture.'' One prisoner had been beheaded.
   Reporters and others listening to the two-way radio
conversations between inmates early in the siege heard prisoners
talking about the carnage under way.
   One inmate radioed: ``There's a whole lot of dead in A-1, about
15.'' That prompted another to plead for no more violence in a
general broadcast to the prison.
   Clouds of thick black smoke billowed from several areas of the
penitentiary as helpless officials outside identified the burning
buildings: the administration offices, the gymnasium, the
psychiatric ward.
   ``Get a fire truck in here,'' a riot leader called Chopper One
radioed just before dawn. ``There are men suffocating to death.
There's fire, a lot of places on fire, in the chapel, in the gym.''
   Early in the rebellion, the prisoners had released two injured
guards, but Chopper One later told officials, ``If you don't start
negotiating pretty soon, these (remaining) guards are going to get
wasted.''
   Corrections Secretary Felix Rodriguez and Deputy Warden Robert
Montoya went inside to talk with inmates, but King said they had
problems determining who was leading the rebellion.
   ``They will start talking to one inmate and another will run up
and say he is in charge,'' the governor said.
   At first, he said, there were no specific demands.
   ``They said they were treated like kids and not like men,'' King
said.
   The inmates did demand that there be no prosecution for any
crimes committed during the riot, but state officials refused.
   Later, the prisoners drew up a list of 11 demands, including
better food, recreation, visiting conditions and educational
opportunities, an end to overcrowding and assurances there would be
no retaliation for the uprising.
   About 80 inmates who had announced they wanted no part of the
rebellion moved to the prison ball field about 8 a.m. Saturday.
Throughout the day, more inmates surrendered.
   By Saturday night, Warden Jerry Griffin estimated about 450 had
turned themselves in. And although the prisoners were still in
control, Griffin said the situation was stable.
   The inmates continued releasing hostages one by one; by early
Sunday morning, nine still were held. By midday Sunday, most of the
fires had died down, about half the prisoners had surrendered and
two more guards were freed.
   Seven inmates had been confirmed dead and dozens were
hospitalized, some for drug overdoses after rioters broke into the
penitentiary's pharmacy.
   At 1:45 p.m. Sunday, about 100 guardsmen carrying M-16s and
police officers carrying shotguns marched in, retaking control
within minutes without firing a shot.
   Within hours, the full horror began to be known.
   Lt. Richard Montoya, who headed the state police Special Weapons
and Tactics team that led the move to retake the prison, said,
``There was blood all over, against the wall, smeared around.''
   A blowtorch had been turned on one prisoner and a rod was rammed
through another's head, a mutilation the medical examiner later
determined occurred after death.
   ``Some of these guys' faces are totally gone,'' corrections
officer Fred Herrera said. ``There's nothing to identify.''
   ``National guardsmen are throwing up all over,'' said
Corrections Commission Chairman Steven Richards.
   The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month declined to consider
New Mexico Attorney General Hal Stratton's challenge to the consent
decree governing New Mexico's prisons, which Stratton contended the
federal courts lack the jurisdiction to enforce.
   The former inmate whose 1977 lawsuit led to the decree, Dwight
Duran, blames efforts to overturn it on conservative,
``saber-rattling'' legislators.
   He called the decree the inmates' only way to prevent the prison
system from backsliding.
   ``I'll still be around,'' Duran said, ``and so will a lot of
other people who believe as I do and who are knowledgeable enough
to do battle with the saber-rattlers.''

<HEAD>Recession Fears Develop Tardily</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The realization that a recession is possible
seems to come as a shock to a good part of the investment and
economic fraternity, almost as if they had been caught from behind
by a mugger.
   But the signals have been flashing all year long.
   The rate of corporate earnings increases has been shrinking for
a year, but it wasn't until September that it seemed to grab
attention. The index of leading economic indicators has also been
flashing yellow since last January.
   Industrial production has been showing weakness for several
months, and the level of corporate dividend cuts or omissions has
been moving higher. Banks are in trouble, inventories have been
growing, factories have cut work weeks.
   Nobody knows better than brokers that the seven-year era of
growth has encountered problems: some have had their commissions
cut, their companies have run into financial problems, their
analysts have been issuing warnings.
   It was there in the numbers too, in the various ratios of stock
prices to values, such as the price-earnings and price-equity
ratios, which were running higher, albeit not by much, than their
long-term averages.
   But all the warnings might not have mattered, however, judging
from the sense of shock being expressed around Wall Street, among
economists and in the laboratories of academe. They may not have
heeded their own advice.
   That the economy was likely to slow was evident in still another
obvious way _ the determination of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve, to resist any substantial economic growth until he
had conquered inflation.
   While some people, perhaps even including a few in the White
House, might think that any inflation rate below 5 percent is
tolerable, Greenspan more than once has indicated that nothing
above zero is acceptable.
   The very attempt to achieve anything approaching zero inflation
was in itself a warning, because no person or institution can
tinker with an inflation level that low without running the danger
of recession.
   The warnings, therefore, were there _ and seemingly ignored.
Seven long years of expansion, unprecedented in any peacetime
period this century, probably had dulled the sense of fear that had
prevailed throughout the 1970s.
   That dulling was evident in the annual forecasts issued during
December, when one forecast after another came out with the same
view of 1990, a year of slow growth, low inflation and _ underlined
_ no recession.
   Now that recession fears have been roused, it seems there exists
a danger that those fears will cloud the outlook as badly as their
earlier absence hid the true nature of things. It wouldn't be the
first time.
   In fact, while everyone is talking about a recession to come,
the factors of recovery might be taking shape. The Fed, for
example, could be thinking about easing money restraints. The
Japanese could be looking at U.S. stocks.
   The past demonstrates clearly that economic forecasters are at
their best when little change is expected, and at their worst in
attempting to spot economic turnabouts. It could happen again.
   They are not alone in their failure to discover either the
present or the future. When Gerald Ford was president he had just
begun a campaign to cool the economy and whip inflation when his
economists spotted a cloud.
   It was recession instead.

   After months of promising its creditors 100
cents on the dollar, struggling Eastern Airlines has proposed
paying off only part of its debts to unsecured creditors, and
giving them a 40 percent stake in the slimmed down carrier.
   Officials of Miami-based Eastern presented the revised
reorganization plan Thursday in a meeting with major creditors at a
New York hotel.
   Eastern proposed that unsecured creditors be paid only 10
percent of their debts in cash when the airline emerges from
bankruptcy protection, and another 70 percent over the following 10
years, without interest.
   In return for accepting partial repayment, Eastern's parent,
Texas Air Corp., would give the creditors 40 percent of the
airline's equity, reducing its holding to 60 percent.
   Under Eastern's two previous plans, unsecured creditors were to
be repaid in full with interest at the completion of Chapter 11.
Eastern owes the unsecured creditors, primarily trade suppliers
such as aircraft manufacturers, around $1.1 billion.
   Eastern's plan also calls for paying preferred stockholders, to
whom it owes another $1.175 billion, no more than 10 cents on the
dollar in the form of new stock.
   On the other hand, consumers holding $45 million in Eastern
tickets made unusable by the strike that began last March 4 still
would receive full cash payment if the reorganization plan is
approved by the court. They also would have the option of
exchanging tickets for other Eastern tickets of higher value.
   Attorneys for the unsecured creditors' committee said they were
reserving judgment on the new plan.
   ``The committee will evaluate this plan as well as consider
other options and will measure this plan against various
alternatives,'' said Adam Harris, a lawyer for the group. He
declined to elaborate.
   Eastern also told the creditors it expects to post a net loss of
$280 million for the fourth quarter, bringing losses for all of
1989 to an estimated $850 million. The airline also projected a
$125 million net loss for the first quarter of 1990.
   Thursday's meeting followed news that a major shareholder in
Texas Air had sold its stake in the nation's largest airline
holding company.
   Loomis Sayles &amp; Co., an investment firm based in Boston, said
Wednesday it had sold its stake in Texas Air, also the parent of
Houston-based Continental Airlines. Last summer, Loomis Sayles
controlled 12.3 percent of the company.
   ``I sold every share I owned,'' said Ken Heebner, Loomis Sayles'
portfolio manager. ``If I had other airlines, I would have sold
them.'' He said airline stocks are no longer attractive.
   Stock of Houston-based Texas Air continued to drop Thursday,
falling 37{ cents to close at $7 after plunging $1.37{ on Wednesday.
   Before the meeting, rumors swirled that Texas Air itself could
seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors, as did
Eastern last March and Continental in 1983.
   The Fort Worth (Texas) Star Telegram published an article
Wednesday headlined, ``Texas Air Fighting Rumors of its Demise.''
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent rejected the article on Thursday.
   ``Continental is not going into bankruptcy. Texas Air is not
going into bankruptcy. Eastern is not going to be liquidated,'' he
said in a telephone interview from Houston. ``We are in very good
financial condition.''
   Kent said the three companies together have around $1 billion in
cash, including funds held in escrow that Eastern raised by selling
a number of assets, including its Northeast shuttle service.
   Texas Air reported a net loss of $158 million in the third
quarter of 1989, as Eastern's losses offset profits at Continental.
   In a statement issued late Thursday, Eastern said it plans to
emerge from bankruptcy as soon as mid-year as a ``strong
competitor'' with $500 million in cash, access to new aircraft and
a more conservative balance sheet.
   The new reorganization plan ``helps position Eastern as a
significant competitor and provides definite advantages to the
consumer,'' Eastern President Phil Bakes said in the statement.
``That has always been our primary goal.''
   In the plan, Eastern also proposed to continue to pay employees'
retirement and pension benefits in full.
   Holders of Eastern preferred stock would receive new preferred
shares equal to 5 percent to 10 percent of the current stock value,
depending on the issue. Some of the new preferred shares would pay
10 percent annual dividends after a two-year period.
   Creditors are expected to review the proposal next. Eastern and
its creditors must agree to the plan, then obtain the approval of
the bankruptcy court before the proposal can be implemented and
Eastern can emerge from bankruptcy.
   Eastern also said it plans to ask the court for $100 million in
cash from escrow funds to cover operating expenses. Similar
requests totaling $210 million have been granted previously.
   In addition to the Air Line Pilots Association, the Machinists
and the Transport Workers Union, other members of the creditors'
committee include Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft
consortium; General Electric Co.; Boeing Co.; United Technologies
Credit Corp.; Rolls-Royce Credit Corp.; Marriott Corp.; and AT&amp;T
Communications.

<HEAD>SEC Suspends Stock Trading of Generic Drug Maker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has
suspended trading for 10 days in the securities of Bolar
Pharmaceutical Co., the generic drug maker accused of falsifying
safety claims.
   The SEC said it suspended trading Thursday because of ``the lack
of adequate current information concerning the recent public
disclosure that certain false documents were submitted to the Food
and Drug Administration.''
   On Tuesday, a House subcommittee disclosed a letter from Bolar's
attorneys that indicated the Copaigue, N.Y.-based generic drug
maker apparently falsified documents about safety tests for its
version of a popular blood pressure-controlling drug.
   The SEC said suspension of trading for Bolar securities began at
9:30 a.m. Thursday and would continue until 11:59 p.m. Feb. 3.
   ``The SEC made their decision to suspend trading because the
company did not disclose enough information and when we can, we
will,'' a Bolar spokeswoman, Patricia Shukri, said from the
company's Long Island headquarters.
   ``This whole matter is under investigation and the company
cannot make further comment at this time,'' she said.
   Bolar's anti-hypertension drug is the only generic version of
Dyazide on the market after another company took its version off
the market after it admitted cheating on tests required for FDA
approval.
   Dyazide is a widely prescribed high blood pressure medication
made by SmithKline Beecham. Two generic versions of the drug were
approved by the FDA.
   In August the FDA said it would seek to remove Bolar's version
of the drug, claiming the drug maker may have misrepresented
documentation and safety data. An allegation Bolar denied.
   However, the House Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee
on oversight and investigations disclosed a letter from attorneys
for Bolar which said the company appeared to have used false
documents to fight government action against its generic form of of
Dyazide.
   Leaders of the subcommittee said Tuesday that it appears the
company was involved in a ''criminal cover-up'' and called for
Bolar to remove its generic drug Dyazide from the market.

   A group dedicated to fighting telemarketing
fraud is urging victims of con artists to speak out and report them
to the authorities.
   ``Please don't suffer in silence,'' said Mike McCarey, of the
Federal Trade Commission's consumer protection bureau.
   ``Don't be ashamed if you become a victim,'' said Linda F.
Golodner, executive director of the National Consumers League.
``Report it to the authorities so something can be done to help the
next person.''
   They were among the speakers at a news conference in Washington
Thursday sponsored by the Alliance Against Telemarketing Fraud.
   The alliance, in announcing its predictions for the 10 most
prevalent telemarketing scams this decade, warned that crooks and
con artists are updating their scams for the 1990s.
   The decade's new con jobs include bogus offers that
``guarantee'' _ for a hefty fee _ to help sell that vacation
timeshare unit you got stuck with in the 1980s.
   In another, mortgage acceleration scalpers promise to ``help''
homeowners save money by paying off their loan obligations early
but actually wind up costing them much more.
   ``With each change in technology, there's a new twist,'' said
Ms. Golodner of the National Consumers League, one of the 60
consumer groups, trade associations, government agencies,
businesses and labor unions that form the alliance.
   The Federal Trade Commission estimates that telemarketing fraud
has cost consumers $1 billion a year for the last five years.
   Kansas Securities Commissioner Doug Mays went even further.
   ``These people are crooks. Their weapons are telephones _ not
guns,'' he warned, adding ``If you own a telephone, then you are a
potential victim for these people.''
   The alliance's watch list of schemes aimed at relieving U.S.
consumers of their money includes ``abusive'' 1-900 long distance
telephone numbers that charge the unwary several dollars per minute
_ often while they are kept on hold for information they could get
for free.
   ``The industry is trying very hard to police our end of it, but
we're only one part of the equation,'' said Ken Griffin, a
spokesman for American Telephone and Telegraph Co. He said AT&amp;T
screens potential 900-service customers for credit background and
other routine information but not for how the phone link will be
used.
   Although there are numerous legitimate telemarketers, ``we want
to warn consumers that con artists are making these types of offers
through high-pressure sales pitches providing little concrete
information,'' said Ms. Golodner.
   Richard Barton of the Direct Marketing Association, a trade
group of about 3,000 telemarketing companies, said, ``We believe
very strongly as an industry that telefraud is very harmful to our
businesses.''
   Barton, who also attended the news conference, noted that his
association maintains a code of ethics but ``an outright fraudulent
organization is not going to pay attention to us anyway.''
   All of the speakers urged consumers to avoid becoming victims by
checking out offers that sound too good to be true, asking for
explanations in writing, hanging up on high-pressure salespeople
and taking their time before agreeing to buy.

<HEAD>High Taxes Drive Canadian Beer Buyers Across The Border</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: All dollar figures are U.S.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FLIPPEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT ERIE, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Visitors to this border town shouldn't
be surprised if the cold Canadian beer their host offers them has
an ``imported'' stamp on it these days.
   An increasing number of Canadians who live near the U.S. border
have taken to buying their favorite brews in the United States,
where popular Canadian beers sell for as little as half the price
charged back home.
   The trend is seriously worrying the managers of beer outlets in
border towns such as Fort Erie, just across the Niagara River from
Buffalo, N.Y. They say they're hamstrung because of government
controls on price and marketing.
   ``We're not on a level playing field,'' said Gordon Reichett,
manager of the Fort Erie Beer Store. ``There's no way for us to do
anything about the marketing because we're limited by the (Ontario)
Liquor Control Board.''
   In Ontario, for example, beer may be sold only through Beer
Store outlets and provincial liquor stores, and prices, by law,
must be the same everywhere.
   That leaves border-area beer sellers unable to meet the
competition from New York supermarkets, which use beer as a loss
leader to lure customers.
   ``We use some beers ... as draws to get people into the
stores,'' said Mark Zee, manager of a Tops supermarket in Buffalo.
``We don't lose money on it but we don't make a lot either.''
   In Buffalo, Canadian brands such as Molson Golden or Labatt's
Blue cost about $12 a case, including tax, deposit and the
round-trip toll on the international Peace Bridge. The same beer
costs $19.65 a case at Beer Store outlets, which control 94 percent
of Ontario's beer trade.
   The price difference has existed for years, but merchants on
both sides of the border said Canadians only began shopping for
beer in the United States in large numbers about a year ago, when
the Canadian dollar strengthened against U.S. dollar and American
stores began advertising heavily in Canada.
   Reichett said business at his store is off 11 percent from last
year's pace.
   Sales would be even slower if it weren't for U.S. shoppers
seeking premium high-alcohol Canadian beers that are unavailable in
the United States. Those buyers now make up almost 25 percent of
his business, he says.
   ``The Fort Erie people are not buying the Molson Dry and the
Brador and the Extra Stock ales,'' Reichett said. ``It's the
American clientele, and thank God for them.''
   Canada Customs does not keep statistics on beer imports, but
inspectors at the Peace Bridge estimate that Canadian brands
account for about 30 percent of the beer that Canadians bring back
from the United States.
   Jan Westcott, executive director of the trade group Brewers of
Ontario, said the problem exists throughout the province's borders
with New York, Michigan and Minnesota. He said high alcohol taxes
are the culprit.
   ``If you take $10 worth of tax off and account a little for the
exchange rate, there's not that much difference in the price,'' he
said. ``We have a very aggressive tax policy with respect to
alcohol.''
   Even when you add in $6.80 a case in tax and duty collected by
Canada Customs at the border, it's cheaper to buy beer in New York.
And that's only if shoppers declare their beer. Some don't, and
many who do say they often are waved through without paying duty.
   ``They're pretty slack on the bridges these days, letting people
go back and forth with whatever they want,'' said Larry Shale,
manager of the Beer Store in Niagara Falls, He said business at his
store is off almost 20 percent in the past year.
   ``If they were stricter in controlling what goes over the
bridges, that would help us.''
   Customs officials say that's an exaggeration, but admit many
shoppers do get by without paying duty, especially on busy days.
   ``We get some days where the traffic's backed up across the
bridge,'' Stuart McLeod, a Canada Customs supervisor in Fort Erie.
``There's no way of collecting duty on every single case.''

<HEAD>Unisys Profit Down; Blumenthal Retiring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   W. Michael Blumenthal, the former treasury
secretary who engineered the creation of Unisys Corp., has
announced his long-expected retirement after a year of losses and
layoffs that ended on a profitable note.
   Blumenthal, 64, the company's chairman and chief executive
officer, will retire in April to join the investment banking firm
Lazard Freres &amp; Co. as a limited partner, Unisys said in a
statement from Detroit, where the board of directors met Thursday.
   The board gave the CEO position to president James A. Unruh, 48,
who also will retain the title of president. Blumenthal will remain
chairman of the board.
   Unisys also reported its fourth-quarter profit fell 84 percent
as a weak U.S. market offset strong international growth and
previously announced layoffs took a toll.
   Blumenthal was chairman of Bendix Corp. for five years before
President Jimmy Carter named him treasury secretary in 1977. He
resigned in 1979 to join Burroughs Corp. and was chief executive
when the Detroit-based computer maker took over Sperry Corp. to
form Unisys in 1986, the biggest acquisition ever in the industry.
   ``After almost two decades of managing major industrial
companies and 10 years at Burroughs and Unisys, the time has come
for my long-planned retirement,'' Blumenthal said in a statement.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, the company reported net
income of $34 million, or 5 cents a share on a fully diluted basis,
compared with $218 million, or $1.05 a share, in the same quarter
of 1988.
   Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $2.97 billion, up 2
percent from $2.91 billion a year earlier.
   Decreases in defense business and U.S. commercial computer
orders offset double-digit growth in international orders, Unisys
said from its Blue Bell headquarters. The U.S. business was hurt
temporarily by a $230 million restructuring charge against
third-quarter earnings that included the layoff of about 8,000
employees and consolidation of factories, the company said.
   But the restructuring helped the company return to profitability
and a positive cash flow from operations after a $648.2 million
loss in the third quarter, Unisys said.
   For all of 1989, Unisys reported a loss of $639.3 million, or
$4.71 a share. In 1988, the company reported a profit of $680.6
million, or $3.27 a share.
   Revenue for the year rose 2 percent to $10.10 billion from $9.94
billion.
   Unisys said inventories were cut $216 million during the quarter
to $1.8 billion, bringing the year's reduction to $723 million. The
company had set a goal of reducing inventories by $500 million
after they rose $628 million in 1988 to $2.5 billion.
   ``We are encouraged by the very early results from our
fundamental cost structure initiatives,'' Blumenthal said. ``Our
program is on schedule. Benefits are expected to accelerate
gradually with the full impact to be realized in the latter part of
this year.''
   Unisys will seek to reduce debt by $600 million to $800 million
in 1990, in part through the sale of non-strategic and idle assets,
Blumenthal said.
   ``Overall, 1989 was a difficult and disappointing year,'' he
said. ``We believe we have made progress against problems unique to
Unisys, such as the high inventory position entering 1989. And we
moved decisively to adapt to the rapidly emerging new economic
model for the industry in the 1990s. These actions will facilitate
additional progress in the implementation of our strategic plans.''

<HEAD>UAL Noncommital On Union Offer, Opens Door To Davis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. is encouraging United Airlines
employees to work up a formal buyout proposal for the parent
company, but still is keeping other options open.
   The board, for example, opened the door Thursday to a new bid
from Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis. It also said it will
continue to explore a possible recapitalization, rather than a
buyout, as a means of boosting its stock price.
   Separately, UAL underscored the financial cost of the
6-month-old ownership contest when it reported a 67 percent plunge
in its fourth-quarter earnings, due largely to $60 million in
buyout expenses.
   After meeting at UAL's Chicago-area headquarters on Thursday,
UAL's directors issued a statement saying a plan outlined by
United's three labor unions on Wednesday to acquire 75 percent of
the carrier did not constitute an acquisition proposal.
   The board instructed its legal and financial advisers to work
with the unions in developing a formal bid.
   The board also said it would ``consider any acquisition proposal
made by the employee group or any third party when any such
proposal is made.''
   The statement also said the board was releasing Davis and
British Airways PLC from agreements they signed last summer
prohibiting them from making takeover offers of less than $300 a
share.
   Davis first put UAL in play last August with an unsolicited
offer of $200 a share or $4.32 billion.
   UAL's board later accepted a $300-a-share, $6.75-billion offer
from United's management and pilots, with British Airways as an
equity partner.
   That offer collapsed in October when banks refused to finance
it, precipitating a 190-point plunge in the stock market.
   Analysts said UAL may have released the parties from the
restrictions both to avoid future lawsuits should the company be
sold to its workers for less than $300 a share, and to open up the
field to all comers.
   ``I think they genuinely want to get this thing over with and I
think it's fair to open the door to any and all who want to bid on
the company,'' said analyst Stephen Dexter of Kemper Financial
Services Inc. in Chicago.
   Davis sources last week denied a report in Business Week
magazine that Davis was preparing a $250-a-share offer for UAL.
   The California investor did not immediately return calls seeking
comment on Thursday's development, nor did spokesmen for United's
unions.
   British Airways spokesman Sandy Gardiner said his company had no
plans to participate in a new bid for UAL.
   UAL's stock fell $3 to $158.50 Thursday in New York Stock
Exchange trading.
   The buyout proposal revealed Wednesday by United's unionized
pilots, flight attendants and Machinists would put 75 percent of
UAL's stock in employees' hands, creating the country's largest
employee-controlled company.
   The unions have said they will take pay cuts and sign five-year
contracts in return for majority ownership of the nation's
second-largest airline.
   But the proposal left many key issues open, including the
structure, financing and price of a buyout and the role of Chairman
Stephen Wolf in an employee-controlled UAL.
   Meanwhile, UAL on Thursday reported net income fell to $6.8
million, or 31 cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31,
compared with $20.9 million, or 97 cents a share, for the same
period of 1988. Revenues rose to $2.4 billion from $2.2 billion.
   Fourth-quarter expenses of $60 million related to the failed
buyout bid were offset partially by a $40.7 million gain from stock
appreciation rights also linked to the buyout attempt, the company
said. Those pre-tax items combined to depress fourth quarter
earnings by $11.6 million.
   A 34 percent increase in jet fuel costs also depressed earnings,
UAL said.
   For all of 1989, UAL reported net income of $324.2 million, or
$14.96 per share, down 71 percent from $1.1 billion, or $37.87 per
share, in 1988. Revenues last year totaled $9.8 billion compared
with $9 billion in 1988.
   UAL said 1988 earnings were boosted by a $393 million pre-tax
gain from the partial sale of its Covia automated reservations
system and a $523.9 million gain from the January 1988 sale of
Westin Hotel Co.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge Approves Some Interim Financing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge promises swift
action to help ensure that Federated Department Stores Inc. and
Allied Stores Corp. keep their shelves stocked and registers
ringing during Chapter 11 reoganization.
   ``It will be full speed ahead in this case,'' U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. said Thursday.
   Aug gave the two retailers approval to continue funding benefits
for their 100,000 employees. He also granted interim approval to
draw on loans that Federated and Allied said they need to buy
spring merchandise and hold their market shares against competitors.
   James Zimmerman, president of Federated Stores Inc., parent
company of Allied and Federated, said the interim funding would
allow the company's nine department store chains to continue
business.
   Aug said he sympathized with U.S. Trustee Conrad J. Morgenstern
and creditors' lawyers, who argued for delays to give them time to
go through the bulky financial agreements the retailers propose.
   Morgenstern, who is helping steer the companies through the
reorganization proceedings, said his office has been so swamped
that his staff will not be able to start assembling a creditors'
committee until next week.
   ``I realize it's going to put a tremendous burden on everybody
in this room, ... but let's face it, there are no babes in the
woods here,'' Aug told a courtroom packed with lawyers for major
banks and other creditors. ``We're going to come to a decision in
this case on the financing sooner, rather than later.''
   Aug approved Federated and Allied payments for health and
disability insurance, drug and alcohol abuse counseling, employee
educational programs and a company savings plan.
   David Heiman, a lawyer for Federated and Allied, said the
payments would total more than $5 million, but he said the
companies don't know how much all of the programs will cost.
   Warren N. Rothman, a Federated and Allied vice president for
benefits, said paying the benefits that employees earned before the
retailers sought bankruptcy court protection would help boost
employee confidence.
   Thursday's hearings were the first for the retailing divisions
of Toronto-based Campeau Corp. since they filed for protection from
creditors on Jan. 15, listing debts of $7.5 billion. It is the
biggest Chapter 11 filing in American retailing history, brought on
by debts amassed when Campeau bought Allied in 1986 and Federated
in 1988.
   Under Chapter 11, the companies must get court approval to pay
operating expenses and other bills.
   Aug granted Federated and Allied permission to draw immediately
on bank financing to ensure shipments of imported spring
merchandise.
   Federated received interim approval to use up to $50 million for
letters of credit. Allied got interim approval to use up to $50
million in working capital and $80 million in merchandise financing.
   Aug scheduled final hearings on the financing arrangements in
Cincinnati on Feb. 8 for Federated and Feb. 9 for Allied.
   John Zeiger, a Federated-Allied lawyer, persuaded Aug not to
delay final hearings on the bank financing agreements. Zeiger said
provisions of the agreements permit the banks to withdraw from
their commitments if the financing doesn't receive court approval
by Feb. 14.
   ``Another week will be a killer on the business of Allied and
Federated,'' Zeiger said. ``That's why we've pushed as hard as we
have.''
   Harvey Miller, a lawyer for the Citibank-led bank consortium
that has agreed to provide Federated with $400 million in
financing, said the group includes more than 100 banks, 60 percent
of them foreign. He said it would be difficult to recruit new
supporting banks if the Feb. 14 expiration date passed.
   Allied negotiated a $300 million financing agreement with
Chemical Bank.
   The judge also ruled that Federated and Allied may maintain
credit lines they had before the Chapter 11 reorganization
petitions were filed. Federated has a $1 billion credit facility
and Allied $700 million, both through New York's Citibank.
   He also approved Federated's request to be allowed to continue
to sell Allied computerized credit services. And Aug permitted the
resumption of 20 percent store discounts to Federated and Allied
retirees, and $600,000 in bonuses promised to some employees of
Federated's Bloomingdale's chain.

<HEAD>Fox Lobbies FCC in Bid to Become Fourth TV Network</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fox Broadcasting Co. will ask the Federal
Communications Commission to allow it to develop into a true
``fourth network'' to compete with NBC, ABC and CBS free of rules
that restrict network programs and sales.
   Fox Inc. Chairman Barry Diller, in Washington Thursday to press
his case on Capitol Hill and at the FCC, said his company on
Tuesday will ask the commission to relax so-called financial
interest and syndication rules on networks.
   The FCC defines a network, among other things, as a company that
broadcasts at least 15 hours of television programs a week. Fox
Broadcasting, the scrappy three-year-old company that has won a
loyal following with such shows as ``21 Jump Street,'' ``Married
... With Children'' and gritty ``reality'' programs, expects to
achieve network status in September.
   Besides asking the FCC to change the rules _ called fin-syn
rules in the industry _ Fox also wants a waiver from the 15-hour
programming limit so it can ``continue to grow,'' Diller said.
   Fox also wants the FCC to revise its definition of a network,
said Diller.
   The fin-syn rules prohibit a TV network from selling to
independent stations programs that have been presented on the
network. They also prohibit a network from having a financial
interest in programs it does not solely produce.
   Fox has been airing its shows on its seven owned stations and is
selling them to an affiliate ``network'' and to non-Fox-affiliated
stations. The selling to non-affiliated stations would stop if Fox
qualified as a network.
   Fox officials claim the rules are antiquated in an era of
multinational media conglomerates and that they stifle competition.
   ``I think there is sympathy for our position,'' Diller said
after his meetings. ``We are providing the first competition to the
three television networks in 40 years. And it has been the stated
policy of the FCC going back 40 years to do everything they could
to encourage the development of a fourth network.''
   The FCC in 1983 suspended its investigation into the network
rules after then-President Ronald Reagan intervened on behalf of
his former colleagues in Hollywood production circles.
   FCC Commissioner James Quello, after meeting with Diller and
other top Fox officials, predicted it would be a ``very close
call'' whether the commission takes up the company's request.
   ``There's a lot of merit on both sides,'' Quello said in a
telephone interview.
   Congress and the FCC have said they would prefer that Hollywood
and the TV networks work out a new agreement on fin-syn rules.
   The rules are under attack by the three major TV networks, which
have been foreclosed from the multibillion-dollar market for
network reruns on local stations.
   Hollywood TV producers, following a network run of their shows,
can reap huge sums in the syndication market. The networks have
been conducting lengthy and so far fruitless negotiations with
Hollywood television producers on new regulations.
   NBC President Robert Wright has complained to House Energy and
Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., the rules make
it more difficult for American networks to compete with overseas
companies that can produce, own and syndicate their programs.

   The chairmen of Congress' two budget
committees want the government to change the way it tries to cut
the federal deficit, adding their voices to the growing chorus that
says the current system doesn't work.
   The two Democrats _ Rep. Leon Panetta of California and James
Sasser of Tennessee _ proposed separate plans on Thursday to scrap
the oft-derided Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law and replace it
with other mechanisms.
   ``Gramm-Rudman is no longer part of the solution,'' Panetta told
reporters. ``It has become part of the problem.''
   The proposals come amid increasing dissatisfaction in Congress
with the credibility of the budget process.
   Sasser's plan would dangle the possibility of $17 billion in
cuts in the Social Security payroll tax as a reward for each year
lawmakers enact $30 billion in budget savings.
   ``With this shift, every working man and woman in America will
become part of a constituency for fiscal responsibility, because
they have something to gain from deficit reduction,'' Sasser told
reporters.
   Panetta's idea would lower the amount of deficit reduction
required each year, but stiffen the rules by which the cuts are
calculated and achieve a balanced budget by 1998, he said.
   Interest in budget honesty has been galvanized by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. He has sought to justify his plan to slash
the Social Security tax by contending that the retirement system's
huge surpluses make the overall federal deficit seem smaller than
it really is.
   Bipartisan criticism also has been leveled at Gramm-Rudman,
which requires a series of declining deficit targets culminating in
a balanced budget in 1993.
   Legislation enacted last year that claimed a savings of nearly
$2 billion simply by shifting the money-losing Postal Service ``off
budget'' was merely the latest device budget writers have devised
to evade the law's intent. The actual deficit has exceeded
Gramm-Rudman's targets every year since the legislation was passed
in 1985.
   ``Gramm-Rudman simply rewards, on a year-to-year basis, the big
lie,'' Sasser told reporters.
   Both Panetta's and Sasser's plans would abandon the automatic
spending cuts that Gramm-Rudman requires in most federal programs
should the law's deficit targets not be technically met.
   Sassers proposal would require Congress and the president to
agree to $30 billion in deficit reduction each year. It does not
address how those savings would be found, the key question that
bedevils lawmakers and the administration every year.
   If the savings target were achieved, separate legislation would
be considered paring the Social Security tax by $17 billion for
that year.
   Sasser said his plan would result in a budget surplus by 1997.
He said it also would save workers and employers _ who pay the
Social Security levy _ $475 billion over seven years, or an average
of $600 a year per worker.
   Panetta's plan would require about $30 billion per year in
deficit reduction through 1993, and about $20 billion annually
after that until the budget is balanced.
   Any spending increases or tax cuts would have to be offset by
equal savings. Gimmicks such as moving payments out of a fiscal
year to make the deficit appear smaller would be forbidden.
   Panetta would not permit the Social Security trust fund
surpluses to be used to make the deficit appear smaller.

   The Bush administration should do a better job
coordinating the sale of federally owned properties or face the
``real danger'' of depressing fragile real estate markets,
congressional auditors warn.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., a new agency created this summer to
dispose of as much as $300 billion in assets from failed S&amp;Ls, is
prohibited from dumping the property _ selling real estate too fast
for too little money.
   But other agencies with vast residential real estate holdings,
such as the Veterans' and Housing departments, are not restricted
and may try to beat the RTC to the market, the General Accounting
Office said Thursday.
   ``A real danger is that the enormous amount of real estate
assets in federal inventories could tempt some federal agencies to
quickly reduce holdings in anticipation of a growing surplus in
real estate markets that may occur once the RTC begins to actively
market its assets,'' GAO assistant comptroller Richard L. Fogel
told the House Banking Committee.
   ``Such a development could ... depress real estate markets
generally,'' he warned.
   A plan for the S&amp;L bailout prepared by an administration
oversight board ``sheds little light on how asset management and
disposition efforts will be coordinated and harmonized across the
federal government,'' Fogel said.
   However, Diane Casey, a spokeswoman for the oversight board,
said the RTC has been instructed to consult with other agencies and
has already begun meeting with them.
   The GAO, the auditing and investigative arm of Congress, also
criticized the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for failing to
properly monitor billions of dollars of government assistance going
to S&amp;Ls that were rescued in 1988 by the now-defunct Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
   The cost of the assistance approaches $40 billion, yet the FDIC
``has not given ... sufficient priority'' to managing it, Fogel
said.
   Audits assessing the condition of bailed-out thrifts and the
government's likely liabilities were supposed to be finished, for
the most part, by the middle of last year. But only nine of 152
required audits are complete, Fogel said.
   Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office, confirming an
earlier warning from FDIC and RTC Chairman L. William Seidman, said
the cost of the S&amp;L bailout is ``quite likely'' to exceed the $50
billion allotted.
   The RTC is supposed to handle any thrifts failing before August
1992, but probably won't have enough money to do that, said James
L. Blum, assistant director of the budget office.
   That means the new Savings Association Insurance Fund, which
will have $16 billion to spend from 1992 through 1999, ``will have
insufficient funds,'' he said.
   The government would be left in the position of having to keep
insolvent S&amp;Ls open because it lacked the money to close them, just
as it was before the bailout bill passed.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the banking panel,
urged the administration to ``face this reality and come to
Congress with a realistic appraisal of RTC's funding needs, as soon
as possible, rather than slowing down the RTC's activities and
increasing the costs to taxpayers.''

   American consumers who want to know exactly
what's in their food may have to go shopping overseas to find out,
says a consumer advocacy group.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest said Thursday that
U.S. food companies are providing some foreign consumers with food
labeling details the firms have opposed in the United States as too
costly and intrusive.
   ``The labels of almost all processed foods sold in Thailand,
including well-known American products ... disclose the percentage
of each major ingredient contained in the product,'' said CSPI in a
written statement.
   Such labeling would reveal, for example, the percentage of oil
in peanut butter, sugar in a candy bar or flour in a cake.
   Among the products cited by the center as containing more
detailed labeling abroad was Kellogg's Frosted Flakes breakfast
cereal.
   Joseph M. Stewart, spokesman for the Michigan-based Kellogg Co.,
said percentage labeling could mislead consumers who are trying to
reduce their intake of certain dietary substances. ``We don't eat
on a percentage basis,'' he said.
   For instance, Stewart said, a 12-ounce can of cola contains 39
grams, or 11 percent, sugar. By comparison, the 11 grams of sugar
in a one-ounce serving of Frosted Flakes would equal 39 percent of
its content.
   The difference is explained by the lighter weight of the flakes
when compared to the weight of the water in the cola, Stewart said.
   ``At the moment you decide to eat the one with 11 percent sugar
over the one with 39 percent you will have committed the sin of
percentage labeling,'' said Stewart.
   Stewart said Kellogg was complying with Thai government
regulations but opposed such requirements by the U.S. government.
   ``I never expected to find American products with that kind of
labeling,'' said Bruce Silverglade, CSPI legal director, in a
telephone interview.
   Silverglade said he discovered the detailed labeling in a Thai
grocery store last summer when he went in to purchase bottled water.
   Alan Goldberg, a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of
America, said the food trade group opposes percentage-ingredient
labeling on U.S. food products. ``And we will continue to based on
propriety information and trade secrets,'' said Goldberg.
   ``It's not in the consumer interest to put that kind of clutter
and detail on labels,'' said Roger Coleman, a spokesman for the
National Food Processors Association.
   ``To do this kind of labeling does nothing but add to the cost
and confusion for consumers,'' said Coleman.
   ``It is ironic that as U.S. food companies work to keep this
information secret at home, they have been providing the very same
information to consumers overseas,'' said Robert Parrish, a CSPI
staff attorney.
   Consumer, food industry and governmental groups already are
wrangling over legislation that would strengthen and make mandatory
nutrition labeling _ the amount of calories, proteins, fats and
other micro-ingredients _ for all foods.

<HEAD>Prudential Offers to Pay Death Benefits to Terminally Ill</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By FRED BAYLES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The terminally ill and those facing permanent confinement to
nursing homes have a new source of help to pay their skyrocketing
bills _ benefits from life insurance policies that usually are paid
after they die.
   The Prudential Insurance Co. of America intended to announce
today its ``living needs benefit program,'' the first mass-market
plan that lets policyholders tap into their death benefits while
they are still living.
   Prudential will pay close to the face value of a policy if a
doctor certifies the policyholder has less than six months to live
or has been in a nursing home for six months with little hope of
leaving.
   ``The world is changing in many ways,'' Prudential President
Joseph Melone said. ``People are living longer and the medical
treatment that is keeping them alive is getting expensive. These
are real market needs that should be met.''
   Prudential said the new program will be available to current
policyholders with death benefits of $25,000. New customers with
policies of $50,000 also can qualify. There will be no additional
cost for the service other than a small processing charge if a
claim is made.
   Regulators in 10 states have already given the company
permission to offer the program. The company plans to expand the
program to cover some 3 million policyholders throughout the
country.
   The 10 states: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Florida,
Idaho, Kentucky, Montana, New Jersey and West Virginia.
   Once the company receives medical certification, it will assess
the policy, figuring in the amount of interest the company will
lose for making the early payment and deducting it from the
policy's face value.
   For example, the company is looking into the case of a
57-year-old electrician with a terminal bone marrow disease. The
man has three life insurance policies that would pay $186,795 on
his death.
   Under the new program, the man could collect $184,184, or a
lesser figure with the balance to be paid to a beneficiary after
his death.
   Robert Hill, Prudential's senior vice president and actuary,
said prior to the program the man would only be able to get $73,965
before his death by cashing in the policy for whatever interest had
accrued.
   Similarly, a hypothetical policyholder confined to a nursing
home carries a policy that would pay $229,340 at the time of his
death. Under the Prudential program, the man could collect the
money in 60 monthly payments of $3,810, for a total of $228,600.
   If he cashed in the policy, he would receive $163,989.
   Although Melone stressed the Prudential program is no solution
to the catastrophic care issue facing the nation, he said it would
provide an added safety net to policyholders.
   ``The main purpose of life insurance was the unexpected death,''
he said. ``What we are talking about here is another very
meaningful use of a life insurance benefit.''
   Prudential's move comes after a yearlong experiment at its
Canadian subsidiary, which provided advanced payment of death
benefits to 14 policyholders, many of them suffering from AIDS.
   Other companies have taken cautious steps toward accelerated
benefit payments.
   For the past year, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. has
offered a life insurance rider that pays 30 percent of a policy's
face value if the policyholder is the victim of cancer, a severe
heart attack, Alzheimer's disease or a variety of other serious
illnesses. The rider costs an additional 10 percent of the premium.
   ``Much to my surprise, it has not produced a significant amount
of sales,'' said Gerry Goldsholle, chief brokerage executive for
Metropolitan Life's life insurance subsidiary.
   Goldsholle said his company was studying a program similar to
Prudential's.
   John Booth, vice president and chief actuary for the American
Council of Life Insurance, said living benefits has been a
long-discussed issue in the industry, ``but no one has acted.''
   There are many reasons. To introduce such a program, an
insurance company like Prudential must negotiate a maze of
different state regulations. In some states, like New York,
insurance laws must be rewritten to allow the plan. There is also a
question of taxes. While there are no taxes on death benefits, it
is uncertain whether early payment of benefits would be taxable.
   Booth said other companies may overcome their hesitation after
watching Prudential's program.
   ``If this gives Prudential new sales and hurts their
competitors, the competitors are sure to run out and do the same
thing,'' he said.

   Lawyers usually do the bickering in society, but
they may become the subject of the next round of trade bickering
between the United States and Japan.
   Almost two years after Japan opened its doors to foreign
lawyers, U.S. attorneys say barriers impede their business here.
Japanese lawyers charge Americans want to make Japan over in its
own legal image.
   On Thursday, members of the Japanese Bar Association and
representatives of four U.S. bar associations, including those of
New York City and California, met to discuss the restrictions.
   ``Japan will continue to try to resolve these difficult issues
but right now we can't say yes or no,'' said Go Kajitani, deputy
secretary-general of the Japanese Bar Association.
   But U.S. lawyers and government officials who attended the
private talks said the Japanese lawyers' group, which supervises
both Japanese and foreign lawyers in Japan, resisted any changes to
the 1987 law that authorized foreign lawyers to work here.
   Foreign lawyers have a list of grievances: They cannot hire or
forge partnerships with Japanese lawyers to facilitate advising
their foreign clients about Japanese law. They are also generally
barred from arbitration proceedings _ where most legal wrangles in
Japan are resolved _ thus missing out on considerable business.
   And, they say, a requirement that foreign lawyers have at least
five years of experience in their home countries means they can
send only their experienced _ and most expensive _ lawyers to Tokyo.
   These barriers prevent American lawyers from providing
first-rate legal services to help foreign enterprises fight it out
in the relatively closed and difficult Japanese market, U.S.
lawyers and officials say.
   ``These restrictions constitute an important non-tariff trade
barrier because, right now, foreign companies cannot go out into
the market and get the kind of legal services they need,'' said Ned
Perry, chairman of a legal services committee of the American
Chamber of Commerce in Japan.
   Foreign companies can seek the advice of Japanese lawyers,
called bengoshi, but many U.S. lawyers here say bengoshi are not
trained to be advocates for their clients like American or European
lawyers are.
   A U.S. official said access of U.S. lawyers to the Japanese
system is a trade priority for the United States. The U.S.
government has requested Cabinet-level talks on the issue in late
February.
   The issue is a familiar one to top U.S. trade officials. Trade
Representative Carla Hills was a private lawyer in Washington
before being tapped for the Cabinet post and S. Linn Williams,
Hills' deputy in charge of Japan, opened his California law firm's
office in Tokyo in 1987.
   Of the 57 foreign lawyers who have registered to practice in
Japan since April, 1987, almost two-thirds are American.
   Japanese Bar Association members opposed the opening from the
beginning, saying they feared an increase of lawsuits in Japan and
an unwelcome tinkering with the way justice is administered here _
which depends more on mediation of disputes than the U.S.
adversarial system.
   But no flood of foreign lawyers has materialized, and lawyers
say they are not asking to represent clients in Japanese courts.
Japanese lawyers are merely ``drumming up this kind of fear to
protect their own positions,'' said the U.S. official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   With just under 14,000 lawyers in Japan _ compared to 100,000 in
the state of California alone _ there is little competition among
Japanese lawyers, who are generally affluent and revered as
professionals.
   Other U.S. attorneys say the Japanese fear bi-cultural law firms
headed by Americans will dominate international law in Japan, as
they did for a decade immediately after World War II. Beginning in
1955, foreign lawyers were forbidden from working here except as
trainees at Japanese law firms.
   But some Japanese lawyers see the issue as a further U.S.
encroachment on the Japanese system.
   ``America will not be satisfied until Japan overhauls its laws
and regulations to guarantee American companies the same freedoms
in Japan that they enjoy at home,'' wrote lawyer Takeshi Suzuki in
the journal Japan Echo..
   Another rule foreign lawyers complain about is that they are not
allowed to call themselves by their real names. They must use the
names of their resident partners, followed by a Japanese phrase
meaning foreign business lawyer, followed by the name the firm is
known by at home.
   This not only takes up a lot of space on office stationery but
robs a law firm of the powerful advertising value of its name. A
U.S. official says the problem will likely be resolved soon.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. envoy to Hungary and a
cosmetics heir have teamed with other North Americans to form a
Central European investment fund, which already has bought half
interest in a Hungarian bank in a move to take advantage of recent
changes in the region.
   The U.S. ambassador to Hungary, Mark Palmer, is resigning to
become president and chief executive officer of the Central
European Development Corporation, said a statement released
Thursday.
   It said Ronald S. Lauder, the son of Estee Lauder and a
Republican maverick who lost in last year's primary elections for
New York mayor, is the chairman of the new venture. Lauder is a
former U.S. ambassador to Vienna.
   ``The lifting of the Iron Curtain offers an unprecedented
opportunity for capital Western investors to promote and encourage
economic prosperity in Central Europe,'' Lauder was quoted as
saying in the release. ``CEDC (the company's acronym) is putting
that opportunity to work.''
   Lauder described the corporation as ``investors in _ and
believers in _ Central European growth.''
   The group announced it had bought 50 percent interest in the
Hungarian General Banking and Trust Company Ltd. for $10 million.
   Palmer plans to resign from the State Department and end his
diplomatic career following the Hungarian general elections, which
are set for March 25, the release said.
   It said the company would initially concentrate on business
opportunities in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Company headquarters,
now at Lauder's New York City office, will be moved to Budapest,
the statement said without giving a specific date.
   Canadian businessman Andrew Sarlos, a Hungarian expatriate, has
been named vice-chairman.
   Political reforms across the East bloc since last summer have
opened up markets for investors, but until Thursday's announcement,
few companies outside of General Electric, which bought controlling
interest in a Hungarian light bulb company, have stepped forward
with large-scale investments.
   The reforms have opened what used to be closed markets to
potential Western investors in other countries such as Poland,
Bulgaria, Romania and East Germany.

   Swiss watch exports jumped 20 percent
in 1989 to a record high of more than $4 billion, the Association
of Swiss Watchmakers said Friday.
   The association said Swiss watch output now accounts for about
50 percent of world production, dominating the more expensive end
of the world market.
   Exports to Japan, one of Switzerland's major watchmaking rivals,
surged 70 percent to $295 million. As a result, the Japanese
overtook the French as the fifth largest customer, the association
said.
   Hong Kong remains the most important market for Swiss watches.
Exports to the British crown colony topped $660 million in 1989.
   The United States followed with purchases worth $560 million,
Italy with $423 million and West Germany with $327 million, the
association said.
   The watchmakers' association said while the number of watches
sold last year rose only 6 percent, the value soared because of the
increase in demand for more exclusive models.
   The average price for Swiss watch and watch parts leaving the
factory was $53, compared with $8.70 in Japan and only $3 in Hong
Kong, the association said.
   A total 42.5 million watches and watch parts were exported last
year.

<HEAD>USAir Union Accepts Pilots Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union representatives for USAir's 6,000
pilots have accepted a proposed contract, ending 17 months of
negotiations with the carrier.
   Elected members of the Air Line Pilots Association met for 10
hours at a hotel here Thursday before ratifying the contract, the
first for the combined pilot staffs of USAir and Piedmont Airlines.
   ALPA spokesman Chris Beebe said the contract provides slightly
better pay for junior pilots, improved retirement benefits for
pilots who were with USAir before the merger with Piedmont, and
strengthened language to prevent USAir from hiring pilots at lower
pay to fly some classes of airplanes.
   But Beebe said USAir gave little ground on many of the contract
issues.
   ``I'd say we are not overjoyed, but we are comfortable with the
contract,'' he said.
   The contract comes a day after USAir reported a $63 million loss
for 1989, including a surprising $102 million loss in the fourth
quarter.
   USAir Chairman Edwin Colodny told industry analysts last week
that concluding negotiations with several labor groups is a top
priority for USAir in 1990.
   The carrier is still negotiating with two unions representing
its flight attendants and mechanics. Baggage handlers conclude a
vote Jan. 31 on whether to continue representation by the Teamsters
union.
   Analysts agree the airline needs to get on to other business.
   ``The hope of the (union leaders) is to now work with the
company to help make this the profitable, dependable and customer
airline we all hope it will be,'' said Beebe.
   The union representatives voted 15-12 to accept the contract,
but Beebe said the group decided against sending the contract to a
vote of its at-large membership. The union had the option of
ratifying the contract itself.
   Pilots who had been with USAir had been without a contract since
August 1988. Former Piedmont pilots' contract ran out in October
1989.

   The stock market turned in a mixed showing today
in an equivocal response to the latest data on the state of the
economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.46 to 2,570.50 in
the first half hour of trading.
   But losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 372 up, 558
down and 505 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 25.37 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the gross
national product grew at a 0.5 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation, in the fourth quarter of last year.
   The figure was a bit stronger than some analysts had projected.
But observers noted that it was magnified to a great extent by
increases in inventories, which is not usually interpreted as
evidence of robust business activity.
   A separate report showed a 2.5 percent rise in new factory
orders for durable goods in December.
   In the bond market, where traders are especially sensitive to
even slight changes in the perceived pace of the economy, interest
rates rose slightly after the figures crossed financial news wires.
   Teledyne gained 5{ to 339{. The company declared a 5-for-1 stock
split and cleared a previously announced plan for a spinoff of its
insurance and finance subsidiaries.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.23 to 180.84. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .44 at 353.20.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 43.46 to a
six-motnh low of 2,561.04, extending its slide since Jan. 2 to
249.11 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 9 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 520 up, 933 down and 490 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 172.27 million shares, against 207.83
million in the previous session.

   The U.S. economy, hurt by slumping consumer
demand, grew just 0.5 percent in the final three months of 1989 for
the poorest showing in more than three years, the government said
today.
   The meager performance of the gross national product, the total
output of goods and services, was certain to fan the debate over
whether the country is in danger of toppling into a recession.
   The GNP for all of 1989 rose a moderate 2.9 percent. This
followed growth of 4.4 percent in 1988 and was the slowest annual
increase since a 2.7 percent rise in 1986.
   While most private economists say the United States will be able
to avoid an outright downturn, a more pessimistic minority noted
that the government statistics are subject to wide revisions and
that today's growth rate could be lowered in coming months,
possibly to a negative number.
   A recession usually is defined as two consecutive quarterly
declines in the GNP.
   ``The GNP report shows the economy ground to a virtual halt in
the fourth quarter with signs of weakness everywhere,'' said Allen
Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``The economy is flirting
with a recession.''
   But the administration, which is counting on a rebound in growth
to provide badly needed government revenues, was more upbeat in its
assessment of the GNP report.
   Michael Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic
Advisers, blamed part of the fourth-quarter slowdown on one-time
factors, such as the unusually cold December weather, the Boeing
aircraft strike and the effects of Hurricane Hugo and the San
Francisco Bay area earthquake.
   Boskin predicted ``a period of slower growth'' in the months
ahead, but he said the economy would rebound later in the year.
And, while not ruling out a recession, the president's chief
economist said, ``I believe it's unlikely.''
   He said the low growth figures could have a ``modest'' impact on
the fiscal 1991 budget that Bush unveils on Monday, making it
harder to meet the goal of reducing the federal deficit to the $64
billion required under the Gramkm-Rudman budget balancing law.
   But Boskin suggested that rebounding growth later in the year
would cancel any negative impact on the budget.
   The 0.5 percent growth in the fourth quarter marked the
economy's weakest showing since a decline of 1.8 percent in the
second quarter of 1986.
   However, after that one downturn, economic activity rebounded,
helped in large part by a boom in U.S. export sales that lifted the
fortunes of American manufacturers.
   But with the improvement in trade deficit slowing dramatically
this year, manufacturing unemployment has begun to rise again.
   In a separate report showing further weakness, the government
said that orders to U.S. factories for durable goods _ items
expected to last more than three years _ rose just 5.9 percent for
all of 1989, half of the 1988 increase.
   On the inflation front, prices, as measured by an index tied to
the GNP, rose 4.5 percent in 1989. That was the fastest increase
since a 6.2 percent jump in 1982.
   The biggest drag on economic activity in the fourth quarter was
a huge swing in consumer spending, which posted a rare decline of
0.1 percent, reflecting a big drop in demand for new autos.
   It was the first decline in consumer spending in two years and
came after a giant 5.6 percent jump in the July-September quarter,
when consumers had rushed to buy cars to take advantage of discount
pricing.
   Since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic
activity, the big swing in this category had a major dampening
effect on economic activity.
   Other areas of weakness included the second consecutive quarter
in which the trade deficit worsened, reflecting stronger growth in
imports than exports.
   Business investment for expansion and modernization, which had
been a key source of strength, dropped by 3 percent in the fourth
quarter for the first decline in a year. Military spending fell by
$5.4 billion, the biggest setback since the first quarter of 1989.
   In one of the few signs of strength, the GNP report showed that
housing construction, which had fallen for three consecutive
quarters, rose a modest 2.6 percent in the September-December
period.
   It was a sign that the credit easing engineered by the Federal
Reserve Board are beginning to bolster the fortunes of the housing
industry.
   Economists who believe the nation's seven-year economic
expansion will continue are counting on the Fed to ride to the
rescue with further moves to lower interest rates and bolster
economic growth.
   But even optimistic forecasters believe growth this year will be
quite sluggish, with the GNP expected to rise by only 1.8 percent.
   This is significantly lower than the projection of the Bush
administration, which is counting on stronger growth to help the
president keep his pledge of reducing the budget deficit without
raising taxes.
   The Congressional Budget Office, siding with the more
pessimistic private forecasters, projected a 1991 deficit of $138
billion, far above the $64 billion deficit limit set by the
Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law.

   The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. has agreed to acquire
Del Monte's Hawaiian Punch business for $150 million, the companies
announced Friday.
   P&amp;G expects to complete the purchase by March, after required
notification to the Federal Trade Commission, said P&amp;G spokeswoman
Wendy Jacques.
   The Hawaiian Punch purchase will complement P&amp;G's fruit juice
lines, which include Citrus Hill orange juice and Sunny Delight
punch, she said.
   Del Monte spokesman Al Vela said the company decided to sell
Hawaiian Punch to raise money for Del Monte's primary businesses in
canned fruits and vegetables.
   ``It's a strategic investment, and it's going to let Del Monte
concentrate on strengthening the Del Monte brands,'' Vela said.
   The Hawaiian Punch business employs about 280 people, most at
Del Monte's processing plants in New Brunswick, N.J., and Atlanta,
Vela said. He said that without Hawaiian Punch, Del Monte expects
revenues of $1.2 billion this year in the United States, Mexico and
the Caribbean.
   Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble had worldwide sales in fiscal
the last fiscal year of $21.4 billion.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, steadying after
steep losses Thursday in the wheat and soybean markets.
   Soybean futures were slightly higher in a limited recovery from
Thursday's 8-cents-a-bushel slide, which analysts attributed to a
recent slowdown in export sales and to increased precipitation in
the South American soybean belt.
   Wheat futures were fractionally lower in early trading,
extending Thursday's losses, while the corn market was nearly
unchanged.
   Wheat's losses Thursday were blamed on a lull in export sales
and on increased precipitation recently in the U.S. winter wheat
areas.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent lower to \ cent
higher with the contract for delivery in March at $3.85\ a bushel;
corn was { cent lower to \ cent higher with March at $2.39\ a

<TEXT>
   The stock market's January tailspin has been
especially dizzying for investors who had been caught up in the
high-flying hopes engendered last fall by the political upheaval in
eastern Europe.
   Now the letdown has many market participants wondering whether
they erred in trying to cash in the ``peace dividend'' too long
before it ever had a chance to be declared.
   In the waning days of 1989, many Wall Streeters began a crash
course of study into the prospective economic benefits that might
arise from the spread of democracy behind the Iron Curtain.
   The headlines stirred visions of vast new markets in eastern
Europe for many types of goods and services, and of relief at home
for the strained federal budget, in the form of reduced federal
spending.
   All these hopes may prove to have a substantial basis in
reality, many analysts still say. But they caution that it is easy
for investors to get carried away any time they are confronted with
``historic'' changes.
   In addition, they note, market history shows that even concrete
signs of peace in the making don't automatically translate into a
rapid increase in stock prices.
   Some veterans recall that a market top in early 1973, on the eve
of a two-year bear market, came just as signs were emerging of an
end to the long war in Vietnam.
   ``While the spread of capitalism bodes for bullish developments
in the decades ahead, the transition will be painfully slow and
expensive,'' says James Stack, editor of the InvesTech Market
Analyst advisory letter.
   ``We think investor expectations have already surpassed the
realistic benefits for the next few years.''
   Suresh Bhirud, chief portfolio strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.,
doesn't seek to minimize the importance of what has happened.
``It's a wonderful surprise that the threat of a major world
conflict has diminished significantly for the foreseeable future,''
he observes.
   ``If these countries achieve some stability, we would expect a
resurgence in demand for consumer products, capital goods, and
goods and services related to infrastructure construction. This
would be icing on the cake for the world economy, which is already
much stronger than it was in the 1970s.
   ``There are some caveats, however. If the move towards economic
reform continues in most of eastern Europe, extraordinary demand
for consumer goods and food commodities will be created, which
could lead to strong inflationary pressures.
   ``In addition, if political turmoil spreads to the more volatile
areas of the world near-term, shortages of key raw materials could
develop.
   ``Thus, it is quite possible that the euphoria surrounding the
outlook for the 1990s, while probably justified from a longer-term
standpoint, could be premature in terms of 1990 or even 1991.''
   Even in the midst of a broad market setback, some fast-moving
speculators have reaped handsome payoffs from the search for
``plays'' on eastern Europe.
   Last Thursday, for example, while the Dow Jones industrial
average was tumbling to a six-month low, the New Germany Fund made
a dazzling debut in the market, soaring to $22 in its first day of
trading, from an offering price of $15.
   Some other closed-end ``country funds'' have continued to climb
in price even as their ranks grow more and more crowded.
   Most analysts agree that patient investors may find rewarding
opportunities in the future if they keep close tabs on the
situation.
   Concluded Greg Smith, investment strategist at Prudential-Bache
Securities, ``I believe a realization is now settling in that
although there will be a major economic opportunity in eastern
Europe, it will be further out than people were assuming.''

   Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. USA will

officials said Friday.
   Nissan's plant, 30 miles southeast of Nashville, will produce
150,000 engines annually and will require an additional investment
of $25 million, said Nissan President Jerry L. Benefield.
   The operation, which will create 250 jobs, will require a
40,000-square-foot expansion and new assembly lines. This comes in
addition to a $490 million expansion currently under way to add a
production line for a third vehicle in 1992.
   Nissan is now adding 1.2 million square feet to its existing 3.4
million-square-foot plant.
   With the engine production, the plant will employ more than
5,400. It already makes Sentra cars and Nissan small pickup trucks.
   Nissan and Ford Motor Co. announced in 1988 a $900 million joint
venture to produce the Nissan-Ford upscale multipurpose vehicle. It
will be produced at Ford's Avon Lake truck plant west of Cleveland,
Ohio.

   The outlook for sales and profits, which slumped
during the second half of 1989, leveled off for the first quarter
of this year, according to a survey of business executives released
Friday.
   The survey, conducted by Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., indicated
``business optimism has reached a turning point and businesses are
regathering strength for the second half of 1990, said Joseph
Duncan, a Dun &amp; Bradstreet economist.
   ``Prices have moderated, inventories are in line and new orders
are respectable,'' Duncan said.
   In the survey, conducted in November, Dun &amp; Bradstreet asked
1,500 manufacturing, retailing and wholesaling executives what
changes, if any, they expected in sales, profits, prices,
inventories, employment and new orders during the first quarter.
   The survey found expectations for sales and profits edged lower
for the first quarter after steeper declines in the previous two
quarters.
   The outlook for selling prices also dipped after a sharper drop
the previous quarter, while inventories were expected to shrink and
employment expectations also fell.
   The outlook for new orders was unchanged.
   Duncan said the results were consistent with the ``soft
landing'' outlook for the economy that many analysts have predicted.

<TEXT>
   Federal thrift officials said today they are
seeking a cease and desist order against Neil Bush, one day after
the president's son rejected a settlement over his role as a
director of a collapsed savings and loan.
   Neil Bush's actions as a director of Silverado Banking, Savings
and Loan Association of Denver amounted to conflicts of interest,
said the Enforcement Review Committee of the Office of Thrift
Supervision in Washington, D.C.
   The case will be heard by an administrative law judge. If the
order is granted, the younger Bush would be barred from practices
that could constitute a conflict of interest if he ever serves
again with a federally insured financial institution.
   Bush said Thursday the Office of Thrift and Supervision had
proposed the cease and desist order, but he had rejected it because
it would imply that he had acted improperly.
   ``In my view, a settlement agreement would leave an implication
that I misbehaved as a director of Silverado,'' Bush said in a
statement.
   ``As I have said in the past, I have nothing to hide and I have
done nothing wrong,'' he said. ``Therefore, I have refused to
consent to any agreement with the Office of Thrift Supervision and
if they choose to bring action against me, I will fight the matter
in court.''
   Bush, 34, served as a director of Silverado from 1985 to August
1988, resigning two weeks after his father got the GOP presidential
nomination.
   The collapse of Silverado, now operating as part of Columbia
Savings, the largest thrift in Colorado, is expected to cost
taxpayers up to $1 billion.
   Karl Hoyle, senior deputy director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, said in Washington late Thursday that Bush's lawyers
had told the agency Bush intends to contest the allegations of
conflict of interest made by thrift regulators.
   Hoyle said the agency wouldn't seek a more severe penalty, which
would ban Bush from ever working for a federally insured financial
institution, because the office didn't believe it had grounds to
seek it. That penalty has been imposed on five former Silverado
officers.
   In a related matter, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
is considering whether to sue Silverado officers and directors,
including Bush, for damages for losses to the taxpayers in the
bailout.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision said examiners had expressed
``grave concern'' about Silverado's operations, particularly its
heavy investment in Colorado's ailing commercial real estate market.
   They also have focused their investigation on what they said was
``an exceptionally large number of problem transactions'' between
Silverado insiders and borrowers.
   Bush, who was a partner in an oil exploration firm, JNB
Exploration, had business deals with two of Silverado's major
borrowers, developers Bill L. Walters and Ken Good.
   ``Bill Walters had a passive 6.25 percent limited partnership
interest in JNB Exploration,'' Bush said. ``Because I did not
benefit directly or indirectly from any loan or transaction between
Silverado and businesses controlled by Bill Walters, as an outside
director I voted in 1986 with the other directors in unanimously
approving the Walters loans and transactions brought to us by
management.
   ``I voted because there was no conflict of interest under the
federal banking laws and regulations or under the laws of
Colorado,'' Bush said.
   Good, according to Bush, had a more active interest in the
financing and management of JNB Exploration, and ``as a result, I
abstained on all votes concerning Good. The other board members
unanimously approved the transactions with Good,'' Bush said.
   He said both Walters' and Good's relationships with Silverado,
as borrowers and preferred shareholders, were established before he
became a director.
   ``Their relationships with my company, which began in 1983, also
preceded my Silverado board appointment,'' Bush said.
   A former federal S&amp;L examiner, James Moroney, has alleged that
regulators dragged their feet on Silverado because of Bush's
presence on the institution's board and other political
connections. But regulators in Washington have said they
investigated Moroney's allegations and found them invalid. Bush has
said he never sought to use his political connections and wouldn't
have if asked.

   Stock prices finished higher after an active
session Friday, as the release of better-than-expected British
trade figures sparked some buying interest.
   Share prices rose early on the widespread expectation that the
trade figures would turn out better than forecast.
   Prices were boosted further when the government reported that
the current account deficit, the country's widest measure of its
international trade, narrowed $1.9 billion in December from a $2.3
billion shortfall in the previous month. Forecasts had called for a
deficit of up to $3 billion.
   ``The market's rise was partly technical and partly helped by
some reasonably good figures,'' one London dealer said.

<HEAD>Worries About Japanese Appetite for Treasury Issues Weighs On Bond
Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese have gotten slammed by some
Americans for their highly visible investments in U.S. business
properties ranging from Columbia Pictures to Rockefeller Center.
   But this past week's slump in bond prices suggests that the U.S.
government and those holding its debt should put out the welcome
mat for Japanese investors in Treasury securities.
   Over the past few years, the Japanese have been steady and
substantial customers at the quarterly securities sales where the
government has borrowed heavily to finance its expanding debt.
   Market watchers estimate the Japanese typically buy 25 percent
to 35 percent of new Treasury issues maturing in 10 to 30 years.
   As a result, some analysts argue, the government has been able
to peddle its securities at lower rates of interest than it would
have to pay otherwise.
   But worries about whether Japanese investors will be big buyers
of the Treasury's expected $30 billion auction of new securities
next month have weighed heavily on bond prices.
   Those concerns have stemmed from a recent rise in Japanese
interest rates that has narrowed the difference in yields available
on Japanese securities relative to U.S. notes and bonds.
   William Griggs, a partner with the investment firm Griggs &amp;
Santow Inc., said 10-year Japanese notes, for example, were
yielding about 1.35 percentage points below the yields on 10-year
Treasury notes earlier this month, compared with a 2 percentage
point difference at the start of the year.
   While the difference in yields has since widened toward 2
percentage points once again in more recent days, William V.
Sullivan Jr. of Dean Witter Reynolds said the more typical yield
spread has been 2.5 to 3 percentage points.
   The fear among U.S. bondholders is that some Japanese investors
will find the current yields in Japan rewarding enough that they
will decide against taking the extra risks involved in converting
yen to dollars and buying Treasury issues.
   That could drive U.S. rates higher, depressing the value of
bonds already trading in the market.
   The realities of what can happen when foreign investors sit out
a bond auction were illustrated this past Tuesday when the
Resolution Funding Corp. had to pay higher rates than many market
professionals had anticipated to find buyers for its $5 billion
issue of 40-year thrift bailout bonds.
   The Japanese had not been expected to bid on the bonds, which
carry maturities of 10 years later than the Treasury's longest
security and are expected to be far less readily salable than
Treasury issues.
   ``We didn't expect the Japanese to be there, and they weren't,''
said Robert Brusca, economist for Nikko Securities International in
New York.
   He said no conclusions should be drawn from the absence of the
Japanese from the 40-year auction relative to what may happen at
the Treasury auctions expected to be conducted in early February.
   But some traders said the auction illustrated nonetheless that
interest rates must often go higher than expected when the pool of
bidders is smaller.
   Prices of long bonds tumbled in the wake of the 40-year auction,
and got another jolt on Thursday that reflected traders'
sensitivity to the importance of foreign investment in the U.S.
bond market.
   Bond prices careened lower after some press reports suggested
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan had indicated he might
consider the idea of reinstating a withholding tax on investment
income earned here by foreigners. The Federal Reserve later said
Greenspan did not favor such action.
   But the market failed to revive anyway, and prices lost more
ground Friday in the wake of a stronger-than-expected report on
durable goods orders in December.
   By midafternoon Friday, prices of 30-year Treasury bonds were
down more than $25 for every $1,000 in face value for the week.
Their yield had risen to 8.54 percent from 8.26 percent at trhe end
of the previous Friday.
   Griggs suspected yields were getting high enough that Japanese
interest in the upcoming auctions will be strong.
   But Sullivan said it is still too early to tell. ``We have a a
long way to go until we bid these secutiries,'' he said.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid slack foreign
demand for U.S. grain.
   Wheat futures also were pressured by improved growing conditions
in the U.S. winter wheat belt, where recent rains and snowfall have
helped to relieve extreme dryness.
   The action marked the third daily across-the-board decline in as
many sessions as prospects for a pick-up in export sales have
dimmed.
   Mild temperatures this month have slowed demand both
domestically and abroad for corn and soybean meal as livestock
feeds, while increased precipitation has helped both winter wheat
and the South American soybean crop.
   In addition, the Soviet Union, a major buyer of U.S. grains, has
been out of the market and is not expected to return at least until
it has unloaded and distributed boatloads of imported corn that are
reportedly jamming its ports.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent to 4\ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in March at $3.81\ a bushel; corn was 1\
cents lower to { cent higher with March at $2.38{ a bushel; oats

   Stock prices lost more ground in an erratic
session today as traders studied the latest data on the state of
the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down nearly 250 points
from Jan. 2 through Thursday's close, dropped another 14.64 to
2,546.40 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 353 up, 1,134 down
and 443 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department reported that the gross national product
grew at a 0.5 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation,
in the fourth quarter of last year.
   The figure was a bit stronger than some analysts had projected.
But observers noted that it was magnified to a great extent by
increases in inventories, which is not usually interpreted as
evidence of robust business activity.
   A separate report showed a 2.5 percent rise in new factory
orders for durable goods in December.
   In the bond market, where traders are especially sensitive to
even slight changes in the perceived pace of the economy, interest
rates rose after the figures crossed financial news wires.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which warned that it might be
hard to match last year's earnings growth rate in 1990, fell 2{ to
38|.
   Other losers among the blue chips included Coca-Cola, down 2 at
66}; DuPont, down | at 36}; General Electric, down ~ at 61&lsqb;, and
International Business Machines, down | at 95\.
   Teledyne climbed 8 to 342. The company declared a 5-for-1 stock
split and cleared a previously announced plan for a spinoff of its
insurance and finance subsidiaries.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.35 to 179.26. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 3.18 at 350.46.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 168.10 million shares with an

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The U.S. economy slowed almost to a standstill
in the last three months of 1989, registering a barely perceptible
0.5 percent annual growth rate that was the poorest since the
spring of 1986, the government said Friday.
   The weak growth in the gross national product, the country's
total output of goods and services, raised fears among private
economists that the record seven-year-long peacetime expansion was
in danger of ending, especially if jittery financial markets drive
interest rates higher.
   The Bush administration was more upbeat, however, predicting
that the sluggishness will be followed by an economic rebound,
although Vice President Dan Quayle called the GNP report
disappointing, adding, ``These numbers this morning were not what
we had hoped for.''
   The Commerce Department blamed the big drop-off in growth from
October through December on a rare decline in consumer spending, a
deteriorating trade deficit and a slump in business investment
spending.
   For the year as a whole, the GNP grew by 2.9 percent, following
a much more rapid 4.4 percent increase in 1988. It was the slowest
annual growth rate since a 2.7 percent rise in 1986.
   Even with the slower growth, inflation was slightly worse during
the year with a price index tied to the GNP rising by 4.5 percent,
up from 4.2 percent in 1988 and the worst showing since 1982, when
it was 6.2 percent.
   While the fourth quarter GNP advance was in line with
expectations, many economists questioned where the economy will get
strength for a rebound.
   ``The economy ground to a virtual halt in the fourth quarter
with signs of weakness everywhere,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist for the Boston Co. ``My own view is that we are near and
possibly headed into some sort of a recession.''
   Other economists were not as pessimistic, believing that the
Federal Reserve would provide another dose of lower interest rates
if necessary to spur growth.
   ``We are on the bottom edge of the famous soft landing, although
it is somewhat softer than one might have wanted for comfort,''
said Robert Dederick, chief economist of the Northern Trust Co.
``Nevertheless, the odds are against a full-fledged recession.''
   Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, told reporters at the White House that the credit easing
engineered by the Federal Reserve since last June was one of the
reasons he was optimistic that growth will rebound and the fourth
quarter weakness will turn out to have only a ``modest'' impact on
the budget deficit.
   The administration is basing its $1.23 trillion budget for 1991,
due to be unveiled Monday, on a forecast that the GNP will grow 2.6
percent this year, when measured from the fourth quarter of 1989 to
the fourth quarter of 1990.
   But private analysts, even the majority, who are not forecasting
a recession, are decidedly less optimistic, projecting a lackluster
GNP increase this year of around 1.8 percent, which would be the
slowest growth rate since the recession year of 1982.
   Economists were split on how quickly the economy will regain
strength. Michael Darby, Commerce undersecretary for economic
affairs, predicted that GNP growth would rise above 1 percent in
the current quarter.
   He said that a variety of one-time events, including the Boeing
strike, the San Francisco earthquake and Hurricane Hugo, had all
dampened growth during the last three months of 1989.
   But private analysts said recent uneasiness in the stock and
bond markets could take a toll on economic growth by pushing
interest rates up to continue to attract foreign investors. Such a
development would harm housing and other interest-sensitive sectors
of the economy.
   In addition, analysts noted that what little strength there was
in the fourth quarter GNP report came from a substantial $10.7
billion rise in unsold business inventories, a potential drag on
future production.
   Dederick said he expected that GNP growth would remain stuck at
a weak 0.5 percent rate in the current quarter as well but that the
two very weak quarters would be followed by better prospects for
the rest of the year.
   He noted that a separate report Friday on orders to factories
for big-ticket durable goods climbed 2.5 percent in December,
following a 4.9 percent November gain.
   The 0.5 percent GNP increase was the weakest quarterly showing
since a decline of 1.8 percent in the second quarter of 1986,
another period of sluggish activity and one that raised fears at
the same time the recovery from the 1981-82 recession was in danger
of stalling out.
   The biggest drag on activity last quarter was a huge swing in
consumer spending, which went from a robust growth rate of 5.6
percent in the third quarter to a rare decline of 0.1 percent in
the fourth. The swing was attributed to car sales, which surged in
the third quarter as consumers responded to sales incentives only
to slump when the incentives ended.
   The trade deficit worsened for the second quarter in a row,
rising by $4.7 billion as export sales failed to keep up with a
surge in imports. Business investment spending fell by 3 percent.
   The various changes put the GNP at an annual rate of $4.168
trillion in the fourth quarter.

<HEAD>Say UAL Employee Buyout Plan Promising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SARAH NORDGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new employee buyout proposal for UAL Corp.
holds more promise than a previous employee offer that collapsed in
October and helped cause a sudden selloff on the stock market,
securities analysts said Friday.
   ``If the price is in the $190 (a share) to $200 range, it should
be a doable deal,'' said Louis Marckesano, an industry analyst for
Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.
   ``If they have a unified proposal among the employees, I
wouldn't really think it would be that difficult,'' he said.
   Machinists, who represent 25,000 employees in the parent of
United Airlines, opposed the original employee bid on grounds it
would saddle the company with too much debt. But this week they
said they would join with pilots, flight attendants and other
workers in the new buyout effort.
   Labor unity and a realistic offer _ much lower than the
$300-a-share, $6.75 billion bid last fall _ would go a long way in
reassuring the banks needed to finance the deal, another analyst
said.
   The collapse of the previous buyout offer on Oct. 13 scared many
investors thought it signaled the end of the corporate takeover
activity buoying the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average
dropped 190 points that day.
   ``If you go back and look at what the concerns were before, the
major concern most of the banks floated was the fact that the
machinists union was not part of the buyout proposal,'' said the
airline analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Moreover, he said, ``At $300, the price was much too high. If
they can make a bid at $200 or less, that will go a long way at
satisfying that concern.''
   Employees still have not agreed on a price for an offer and have
not yet offered a concrete plan for its financing.
   UAL has been mired in efforts to define its future since last
August, when Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis made an
unsolicited offer of $200 a share or $4.32 billion for one of the
nation's largest airlines.
   This week, UAL encouraged employees to work up a formal buyout
proposal but still kept other options open, releasing Davis from
prior agreements prohibiting him from making an offer for less than
$300 a share. Some analysts doubted, however, that other bidders
would resurface.
   Marckesano said one key issue yet to be resolved is the role
current chairman Stephen Wolf would play in an employee-controlled
UAL.
   ``The big question is Mr. Wolf,'' he said. ``I'm a Wolf fan _ I
think whatever course UAL takes in the future they'd be better off
with him steering the ship.''
   But the analyst who asked not to be named said machinists had
long resented Wolf. The analyst speculated they joined the buyout
bid only after receiving reassurances Wolf would not be part of the
deal.
   A UAL spokesman refused to comment on Wolf, and a spokesman for
the machinists' union did not immediately return telephone calls
seeking comment.
   The takeover wrangling that's afflicted UAL has come against a
background of uncertainty in the airline industry caused by higher
fuel prices and signs of a broader economic downturn.
   On Thursday, UAL reported earnings of $6.8 million, or 31 cents
a share for the three months ended Dec. 31, drastically lower than
the $20.9 million, or 97 cents a share, for the same period of 1988.
   Quarterly revenues totaled $2.4 billion, up from $2.2 billion in
1988.
   UAL said fourth-quarter expenses of $60 million related to the
failed buyout bid were partly offset by a $40.7 million gain from
stock appreciation rights that were also linked to the buyout
attempt. Those items combined depressed fourth quarter earnings by
$11.6 million.
   A 34 percent increase in jet fuel expenses also depressed
earnings, UAL said.

   News Friday that economic growth slowed to a
crawl in the last quarter capped two weeks in which major U.S.
companies announced more than 15,000 layoffs.
   The upshot, according to many economists, is that employment is
sluggish, particularly in manufacturing, and more layoffs may be in
the offing.
   The gross national product figures released Friday ``suggest the
economy needs to cut production somewhat,'' said Susan Lakatos, an
economist for Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. ``In general, the economy is
slowing.''
   The government report showed the economy grew by just 0.5
percent in the final three months of 1989, the poorest performance
since the spring of 1986.
   ``I think you'll end up with a broad pattern of increasing
layoffs,'' added Richard B. Hoey, chief economist at Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   In the past two weeks:
   _General Electric Co. said it would eliminate about 5,700
aerospace jobs as it prepares for reduced Pentagon spending.
   _Boeing Co. said it would pare up to 5,000 jobs, also due in
part to anticipated defense cutbacks.
   _Grumman Corp., another defense contractor, said it would lay
off 300 workers and eliminate 700 more jobs by year's end for the
same reason.
   _Caterpillar Inc., the heavy-equipment maker, said it would lay
off 1,200 workers.
   _Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said it would lay off more than 3,000
workers as the investment house continues to reel from Wall
Street's two-year slump.
   Going back to the beginning of the year, more than 45,000
autoworkers have been notified of indefinite or temporary layoffs
at plants around the country.
   ``What we're seeing right now is looking dramatic because it's
big companies and big numbers,'' Ms. Lakatos said.
   What's harder to see _ but even more important _ is that
companies of all sizes are not hiring as many new workers due to a
slowdown in expansion, she said.
   The economy's manufacturing sector showed steady growth in
employment until last summer, when it stopped in its tracks, Ms.
Lakatos said. About 20 percent of all U.S. workers are employed in
manufacturing.
   On Friday, the government also reported that orders to factories
for durable goods increased 2.5 percent in December, but that
almost all the gain came in orders for aircraft, ships and tanks.
Excluding these categories, factory orders would have been flat.
   Hoey said the companies making cutbacks in their defense
businesses are taking prudent action because they realize the
defense buildup of the 1980s is ending.
   He believes layoffs will spread from the defense and auto
industries to other areas of the economy this year.
   ``What you're seeing is the early signs of what ultimately will
prove to be a recession,'' he said, giving a minority opinion among
Wall Street economists.
   John Hagens, an economist at the forecasting firm WEFA Group, is
not as pessimistic.
   ``Our view is there will be more layoffs coming and the
unemployment rate will rise, but not like in a recession,'' he said.
   But, he added, job growth overall this year ``will be
substantially less than we've had in the last seven, eight years.''
   During the 1982 recession, for example, unemployment jumped to
about 11 percent from 5.7 percent in 1979.
   In contrast, Hagens' firm forecasts the jobless rate will rise
by one-half to one percentage point this year.
   ``You really can become overly pessimistic about job prospects
and employment growth by focusing on big-company layoffs,'' he
said. Job growth continues in many service industries, such as
health and education, he said.
   However, he added, ``When we have very sluggish growth in the
economy and profits extremely weak in 1989, and unlikely to rebound
in 1990, there will be a shedding of (other) jobs.''

<HEAD>Troubled Drug Chain to Divest More Than 700 Stores</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KRISTI UMBREIT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Revco D.S., Inc., the first big company to seek
bankruptcy-court refuge from debts incurred in a leveraged buyout,
announced plans Friday to sell 712 of its 1,873 stores in a costly
restructuring.
   The company, one of the country's largest drugstore chains with
a work force of 26,800 people, said it would refocus on operations
in Eastern states where sales are strongest.
   ``The strategic advantages of restructuring operations have
become increasingly clear over time,'' said Gregory K. Raven, chief
financial officer for the company based in Twinsburg, Ohio, a
Cleveland suburb. ``Internal and external analyses agree _ this is
what's best for Revco.''
   Its announcement to shrink by more than a third came against a
background of growing alarm about the consequences of the 1980s
debt-financed takeover tactic known as the leveraged buyout or LBO.
   Earlier this month, Toronto-based Campeau Corp., owner of many
famous U.S. department stores, sought Chapter 11 protection because
it couldn't make payments on the multibillion-dollar debts incurred
to buy the stores over the last three years.
   Revco's drugstores will now join many of Campeau's department
stores on the auction block.
   Revco filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors back in
July 1988, about a month after it failed to make an interest
payment on about $700 million in outstanding high-risk junk bonds
used to finance its $1.5 billion management-led LBO in 1986.
   It was the first major LBO to seek the sanctuary of bankruptcy
court to untangle its finances.
   To cover the cost of the restructuring announced Friday, Revco
said it would take a record $230 million charge against earnings in
its third fiscal quarter, which will end Feb. 10.
   The company intends to open discussions with potential buyers
for 712 of its drugstores. Any sales are subject to bankruptcy
court approval.
   Boake A. Sells, chairman and chief executive officer of Revco,
said he believed the majority of company's employees will keep
their jobs. The company hopes that those working in stores now
targeted for sale would be hired by eventual buyers, he said.
   Harrison Jones, manager of the Revco store in downtown Magnolia,
Ark., said he was concerned but not surprised at the news. Arkansas
is one of the states where stores are targeted for divestiture.
   ``Actually, I feel good about it, like maybe someone in this
general area will purchase this thing and it will be solid
financially and they'll take it and run with it,'' Jones said.
   ``Generally (employees at the store) aren't surprised. They're a
little disappointed because on the surface it generally means bad
news,'' he said.
   In October, it was reported that Revco was considering a $925
million buyout bid from a Texas-based group of investors that
included billionaire Robert Bass, well known for his takeover
forays.
   It was unclear Friday whether these investors played any role in
Revco's divestment plans. Revco spokeswoman Kathleen Obert declined
to identify any possible store buyers.
   Sells said it was too early to estimate how long it would take
to complete the restructuring.
   Sales from the stores to be divested represent about 36 percent
of the chain's total sales, the company said.
   Revco plans to concentrate and build on markets in Georgia,
Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South
Carolina, eastern Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.
   Locations targeted for divestiture include 712 Revco drugstores
currently operating: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan,
Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, western Tennessee, and
Texas.

<HEAD>Dollar Ends Mixed; Gold Rises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mixed Friday, weakening
against the British pound and Japanese yen but rising against other
currencies in heavy trading.
   Gold prices rose. On the New York Commodity Exchange, a troy
ounce of gold gained $4.10 a troy ounce to close at $420.10.
Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $420 a troy ounce, up
$3 from Thursday.
   Most of the day's activity centered on the yen, which investors
continued to buy aggressively. Analysts noted that optimism about
the future of Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party ahead of
next month's elections spurred interest in the currency.
   But the dollar suffered as investors sold the U.S. currency to
buy yen. ``There are fears that foreigners are withdrawing from
U.S. markets,'' said Marc Chandler, an analyst at MMS International
in Chicago.
   He said traders are edgy ahead of the upcoming quarterly
refunding. The Treasury Department is expected to announce next
week its schedule for the sale of an estimated $30 billion in
bonds, the proceeds of which are used to keep the government
running.
   Foreigners, who have been attracted by relatively high interest
rates here, need dollars to buy U.S. debt securities. But Chandler
noted that rising interest rates abroad _ especially in Japan _
have incited fears that foreigners will shun the bonds.
   The dollar got somewhat of a boost from a government report that
showed the gross national product posted a 0.5 percent annual
growth rate in the final quarter of 1989. Although the figure,
which represents the country's total output of goods and services,
was the poorest showing since the spring of 1986, it was better
than the market had expected and therefore bolstered the dollar
initially.
   ``The market had already priced in the number,'' said Stephen
Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
Shortly after the figure was released, trading turned again to the
yen.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 143.97 yen, down from 145.30 yen
on Thursday. Later in London, the dollar traded at 143.30 yen. In
New York, the dollar closed lower still, at 142.80 yen, compared
with Thursday's 143.93 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6571 from $1.6570 late
Thursday. In New York it cost $1.6635 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Thursday's $1.6600.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates included: 1.6865 West German marks, up from
1.6850; 1.4900 Swiss francs, up from 1.4850; 5.7290 French francs,
up from 5.7255; 1,254.50 Italian lire, up from 1,253.75, and 1.1966
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1876.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.6935 West German marks, up from 1.6870; 1.4975
Swiss francs, up from 1.4870; 5.7510 French francs, up from 5.7305;
1.9060 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8975; 1,260.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,254.75; and 1.1937 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1903.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $418.75 a troy ounce
from $416.25 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing
bid of $418.50 from $413.50 bid late Thursday.
   Hong Kong precious metals markets were closed for the lunar New
Year holiday. Trading is to resume Tuesday.
   Silver prices moved higher. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery finished at $5.222 a troy ounce, up from
$5.212 on Thursday. In London, the metal rose to a late bid price
of $5.25 a troy ounce from Thursday's $5.22.

<HEAD>Quarterly Earnings Drop 69 percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Instruments Inc., a leading producer of
computer chips, reported a 69 percent drop in fourth-quarter
earnings Friday, blaming the performance on a tighter U.S. defense
budget and lower demand for its products.
   Texas Instruments said earnings less dividends on preferred
stock for the quarter ended Dec. 31 was $35.9 million, or 33 cents
a share, compared with $86.3 million, or $1.04 per share, in the
comparable year-earlier period. Revenues fell slightly from $1.73
billion to $1.72 billion.
   For the year, earnings totaled $291.7 million, or $3.04 per
share, compared with 1988's $335.8 million, or $4.05 per share.
Revenue last year was $6.52 billion, up from $6.45 billion in 1988.
   ``The growth rate of the world semiconductor market slowed
significantly during the second half of the year,'' especially in
the second half, Chairman Jerry R. Junkins said, blaming the
weakness for most of TI's earnings decline.
   ``In addition, the U.S. defense market is undergoing a period of
tighter constraints on spending,'' he said.
   Junkins said TI expects the weakness in semiconductor sales to
continue for several months and historically low first-quarter
defense spending will continue to drive down profits, although he
predicted the company will benefit during the second half from
capital investments and a recovering memory market.

   Crude oil and gasoline futures closed higher
while heating oil had a mixed day on the New York Mercantile

   The March contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark

   Contracts for later delivery ended with gains of between 25
cents and 29 cents.
   Among refined products traded on the New York Merc, February
wholesale unleaded regular gasoline ended 1.52 cents higher at
62.12 cents a gallon. Later contracts advanced but posted lower
gains.
   Meanwhile, wholesale heating oil for February delivery slipped
0.17 cent to 59.60 cents a gallon, while other contracts ended
higher.
   Analysts said crude oil and gasoline rallied after a slow start
as some big refiners made commitments ahead of the weekend.
Meanwhile, heating oil lagged as demand slackened.
   ``Heating oil was just laying there as warm weather continued,''
said Mary L. Haskins, an assistant vice president at Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   Trading in gasoline was particularly buoyant as investors bought
contracts in anticipation of an increase in demand this spring. In
addition, recent statistics showed that gasoline inventories are
lower than last year's, energy traders said.

<HEAD>Wall Street West? Hawaii Looks to Diversify</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DIPIETRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hawaii is making a major push toward becoming a
world financial center, attempting to remold itself as something
more than an exotic Pacific vacation spot.
   Efforts are underway by the state's political and business
community to lure large brokerage houses and create one or more
exchanges that would trade stocks, commodities, currencies, options
and other products.
   At stake for Hawaii is the chance to position itself as a leader
of the Pacific Rim and an opportunity to diversify its
tourist-driven economy.
   ``We have to convince the business community both here and
elsewhere that Hawaii is more than a place to vacation,'' said Bill
Cook of the state Department of Economic Development.
   Since the effort to create a Honolulu stock exchange began in
1987, talks have taken place with several exchanges, including the
New York Mercantile Exchange, Pacific Stock Exchange and exchanges
in Chicago and Asia.
   No deals have been reached, and negotiations are continuing. The
talks are centered on how much assistance and incentives the state
will provide the exchanges, largely in the form of tax breaks.
   Important to Hawaii's exchange bid is that it would fill in the
four-hour time gap between the closing of the New York Stock
Exchange and the opening of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, allowing for
trading on almost a 24-hour-a-day basis.
   ``What we make it easier for American exchanges to do is trade
with Asia on Asian time,'' said Galen Fox, executive assistant for
Honolulu Mayor Frank Fasi. ``If you want to expand business with
Asia, which is in some ways the financial center of the world
already, then you should be catering to their markets and
interests, rather than asking them to get up early in the morning
or at midnight to trade with your markets.
   ``It's a breakthrough in thinking in terms of how important it
is to reach Asia,'' Fox said. ``The breakthrough occurs in part
because you can do it in Honolulu.''
   Another asset is Hawaii's population base, which includes a
sizable mainland and Asian population. It's this diverse cultural
foundation that may convince brokerage firms on both sides of the
Pacific to set up shop here.
   ``You have a number of people here that are very knowledgeable
about both (U.S. and Japanese) markets,'' said David Bess, dean of
the University of Hawaii school of business administration. ``I
think a knowledge base exists here that few other cities would
have.''
   A Honolulu exchange would allow Asian brokers to trade in
products not offered in their markets, and would add to the volume
of their new-born options trading, which started in 1989. Also, all
trades would be regulated by U.S. securities laws, a sales point
being used to placate wary mainland firms.
   Fred Sexton, president of the Economic Development Corp. of
Honolulu and the man leading the exchange effort, said his biggest
challenge is alleviating the skittishness of American brokerage
houses.
   ``The number one obstacle is fear among American companies,'' he
said. ``It's not been done here and they don't know whether they
can generate enough volume to make it successful. The only way
they're going to find out is to do it.''
   Diversification of Hawaii's economy is a major goal of the
1990s, as state and business leaders realize the need to generate
more professional jobs to keep the state's young people from
leaving.
   Tourism accounted for 39 percent of the state's $20 billion in
revenues in 1988, the most recent figures available from the state.
   Officials feel a Honolulu financial center would create hundreds
of high-paying professional jobs, as well as bring a number of
high-technology firms and related financial service companies to
Hawaii.
   ``The whole range of industries that will come in connection
with the emergence of a Honolulu financial center will be
helpful,'' Fox said. ``Related industries like backroom financing
and information-related industries ... these are kind of secondary
benefits from having a financial center grow here.''
   Because of the high costs of setting up an equities trading
floor, it's likely other products like currencies and options would
set up trading floors first, with stock trading beginning after the
foundation is laid.
   ``What I see as a possibility is the trading of currencies,
futures and options,'' said Randy Havre, a broker with J.D. Havre
and Associates. ``It's less costly and more practical than trading
equities, so if and when trading equities would be feasible, it
would have a base to build on.''
   Gov. John Waihee said while Hawaii stands to benefit from a
financial center, it won't come about unless the brokerage houses
have something to gain.
   ``There's no use coming out to Hawaii and essentially processing
the same number of trades as you would in New York,'' the governor
said. ``From Hawaii, you can get into an entirely new market and an
exchange can stand on its own.
   ``The bottom line is going to be whether or not coming to Hawaii
results in the creation of new markets,'' Waihee said. ``If it
does, than the advantage of coming here increases. You can almost
do this anywhere, why not do it in paradise?''

<HEAD>Resilient Gasoline Futures Surge, Leading Energy Market Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline futures prices rose sharply Friday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, showing surprising resilience to bearish
fundamentals and leading the entire group of energy commodities to
a higher close.
   On other commodity markets, pork belly futures fella while
livestock futures were mixed; precious metals advanced; and grains
and soybeans were mostly lower.
   The contract for February delivery of wholesale unleaded
gasoline surged 1.52 cents to 62.12 cents a gallon. Other contracts
settled .55 cent to .97 cents higher.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished 25 cents to 32 cents
higher with March at $22.56 a barrel; heating oil was .17 cent
lower to .28 cent higher with February at 59.60 cents a gallon.
   Much of gasoline's strength apparently stemmed from fears of
tight supplies for delivery against the February gasoline contract,
which expires Wednesday.
   Concerns about such a supply squeeze surface frequently in the
energy market but usually prove unfounded.
   The rally defied a bevy of negative signals, including Tuesday's
weekly American Petroleum Institute report of a large increase in
U.S. gasoline supplies, and the resolution Wednesday of an
eight-day strike by Brazilian oilworkers.
   In addition, a savage storm that ripped through Britain on
Thursday had little effect on the North Sea petroleum industry.
Fears of storm-related disruptions to pumping and refining
operations had contributed to a runup in crude oil values on
Thursday.
   ``The market is remarkably strong despite having a couple of
things thrown at it over past couple days,'' said analyst Peter
Beutel of Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   Pork-belly futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, ending a week of roller-coaster moves in the thinly
traded market.
   The contracts for February, March and May deliveries fell the
permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound after rising more than 1
cent on Thursday and falling nearly the limit on both Monday and
Wednesday.
   The losses early in the week reflected expectations that
Wednesday's monthly Agriculture Department cold-storage report
would show an increase in supplies of frozen pork bellies.
   But the report indicated supplies were much smaller than
expected, prompting Thursday's strong advance.
   Friday's tumble reflected weaker cash markets for both bellies
and hogs, said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp.
in Arlington Heights, Ill.
   Frozen pork bellies were .98 cent to 2 cents lower with February
at 54.10 cents a pound; live cattle settled .23 cent lower to .12
cent higher with February at 79.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle
were .13 cent lower to .10 cent higher with March at 83.42 cents a
pound; live hogs were .48 cent lower to .13 cent higher with
February at 49.25 cents a pound.
   Gold futures climbed strongly on New York's Commodity Exchange
amid stock-market jitters. The Dow Jones industrials average ended
nearly unchanged after seesawing widely during the session.
   Gold futures ended $4.10 to $4.30 higher with February at
$420.30 a troy ounce; silver was 1 cent to 1.3 cents higher with
March at $5.26 a troy ounce.
   Most grain and soybean futures fell on the Chicago Board of
Trade on concerns about slack export sales of U.S. grain.
   Wheat futures also were pressured by improved growing conditions
in the U.S. winter wheat belt, where recent rains and snowfall have
helped to relieve extreme dryness.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 4\ cents lower with March at
$3.81\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to { cent higher with March
at $2.38\ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to \ cent higher with
March at $1.37\ a bushel; soybeans were 2\ cents lower to \ cent

   Bond prices slipped Friday as the market reacted
to government figures that showed the economy was not slowing as
much as some had assumed.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which has lost about 1{
points over the past three sessions, dropped 19-32 point, or about
$5.94 for every $1,000 face amount.
   Its yield, which rises when prices fall, edged up to 8.51
percent from 8.46 percent late Thursday.
   The government released a pair of economic reports Friday saying
the economy grew at a 0.5 percent pace in the final three months of
1989 and that orders to factories for durable goods rose 2.5
percent in December.
   Analysts said the gross national product figures matched
expectations, but many of them had been looking for a decline in
durable goods orders.
   Luke Haney, a bond trader with the Philadelphia brokerage
Butcher &amp; Singer Inc., said the economic news ``kind of puts your
investors on the sidelines wondering exactly what is going on.''
   ``We've just been in a tremendous downflow and there don't seem
to be any buyers out there,'' he added.
   William Griggs, a partner in the investment firm Griggs &amp; Santow
Inc., said the reports disappointed traders who were looking for
signs of economic deterioration clear enough that the Federal
Reserve would be compelled to encourage lower interest rates, a
move that would boost bond prices.
   ``There was nothing in these numbers that will suggest the Fed
will ease policy right away,'' Griggs said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were down by 1-16 point to 3-16 point, intermediate
maturities were off &lsqb; point to 5-16 point, and long-term issues
lost as much as 11-16 point, according to Telerate Inc., the
financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, was down 3.31 at 1,159.63.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 11-32 point to 91 11-32. The average
yield to maturity rose to 7.44 from 7.41 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.91 percent as the
discount fell 1 basis point to 7.67 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 8.02 percent as the discount rose 1 basis point to
7.62 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell marginally to 8.03
percent as the discount remained unchanged at 7.49 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 13-16 percent, up from 8
3-16 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Continental Airlines Fires Ayer As Ad Agency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines said Friday it had
dismissed N.W. Ayer as its advertising agency, ending an
association that began in 1986.
   The Houston-based carrier, a unit of Texas Air Corp., notified
the agency late Thursday that it was placing its advertising
assignment up for review, the agency said.
   ``Ayer is no longer Continental's agency as of today,''
Continental spokesman Art Kent confirmed by telephone from Houston.
``We just felt it was time for a change.''
   He said he could not elaborate and did not know what steps were
being taken to get another agency.
   Ayer had been using the theme ``Working to be your choice'' in
Continental's advertising. Recent ads touting service to
warm-weather destinations used the line, ``We've got your place in
the sun.''
   Continental planned to spend an estimated $35 million to $40
million on its advertising this year, executives familiar with the
account said. Kent said he did not know the actual figure.
   Ayer, a privately-held agency based in New York, handles $1.3
billion in advertising billings worldwide and counts among its
clients American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., Procter &amp; Gamble Co.
and General Motors Corp.
   The decision came as a surprise to Ayer executives, said Vice
Chairman Thomas F. Maxey. ``We had no indication this was coming,''
he said.
   Ayer opened an office in Houston after it was awarded the
account in 1986, and the office currently employs about 30 people.
Ten to 15 more employees work on the Continental account in New
York.
   Maxey said it was likely that the Houston office would be closed
after an orderly transition. Ayer expects to continue servicing the
account for up to 90 days. In addition to the Continental account,
the Houston office handles only a few small public service
assignments at no charge.
   John Walsh, an executive vice president who oversees the
Continental account, said he understood that Continental's business
was improving although the industry has been troubled by declining
traffic and rising fuel costs.
   ``They said they felt they needed a change. In our estimation of
the situation, the situation was good and our work was good,'' he
said.
   Kent confirmed Continental's business was improving. He said the
airline earned $59.1 million for the first nine months of 1989, in
contrast to a loss of $215.9 million a year earlier.
   Texas Air also owns Eastern Airlines, which has been operating
since March under protection of federal bankruptcy laws and has
been losing millions of dollars.
   Airline accounts are particularly labor-intensive, industry
executives say, because of frequent price changes within the
industry and the need to develop different print ads for each
market.
   But Maxey said Ayer would be interested in going after another
airline account anyway. He said the agency handles advertising
assignments for Iberia Airlines, Air France and Scandanavian
Airline System.
   He said the agency is one of the finalists for four different
advertising assignments, which he declined to identify.
   In 1989, Ayer was fired by Burger King Corp. after working as
its ad agency for 18 months and producing the campaign, ``We do it
like you'd do it.'' The fast-food chain was spending $150 million a
year on its advertising then.
   Among Ayer's recent notable ads have been its commercials for
AT&amp;T long-distance service that featured people near the Berlin
Wall and a commercial for Phillip's Milk of Magnesia that used a
roll of toilet paper to illustrate the powers of the laxative.

   Stock prices declined slightly in an erratic
session Friday as rising interest rates and recession worries kept
the market under pressure.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 1.81 to
2,559.23, stretching its loss for the week to 118.67 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
557 up, 951 down and 464 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 198.19 million
shares, against 172.27 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 241.14 million shares.
   The Commerce Department reported that the gross national product
grew at a 0.5 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation,
in the fourth quarter of last year.
   The figure was a bit stronger than some analysts had projected.
But observers noted that it was magnified to a great extent by
increases in inventories, which is usually interpreted as evidence
of weakness in business activity.
   A separate report showed a 2.5 percent rise in new factory

<HEAD>Nation's Largest Defense Contractor Reports More Bad News</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. on Friday reported a 58
percent decline in fourth-quarter profits as major write-offs in
several divisions plagued the nation's largest defense contractor.
   For the three-month period ending Dec. 31, the company had
profits of $60 million, or $1.56 a share, compared with $145
million, or $3.79 a share, for the same period a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter totaled $4.29 billion, up slightly from
$4.14 billion for 1988's final quarter.
   ``This is obviously a major disappointment,'' said Phil
Friedman, a stock analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New
York. ``You never expect write-offs like these.''
   McDonnell Douglas stock closed at $57.62{ Friday on the New York
Stock Exchange, down 62{ cents.
   The company, based in St. Louis, took $127 million in after-tax
write-offs in the quarter _ $91 million for its AH-64 Apache
helicopter, $22 million for its T-45 aircraft training system, and
$14 million in its missiles, space and electronic systems segment.
   Companies take write-offs when they have to reduce the value of
an asset. McDonnell Douglas attributed its reductions to higher
cost estimates that lowered earnings rates.
   The company already had reductions of $162 million in the first
three quarters of the year that contributed to a 37 percent decline
in annual profits.
   For the year, the company reported profits of $219 million, down
from $350 million for the same period a year ago. Revenue increased
to $14.6 billion from $14.4 billion in 1988.
   ``They're having a lot of trouble figuring out where their
problem is and that doesn't give the investor a lot of
confidence,'' said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with Prudential Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   Along with the write-offs, the company's transport aircraft
division, based in Long Beach, Calif., continued to struggle
through cost overruns and increased interest expenses.
   The division, called Douglas Aircraft Co., has said all of its
programs including the development of the Air Force's C-17 cargo
plane and the new commercial, wide-body jet, MD-11, are behind
schedule.
   In the fourth quarter, the division had a profit of $5 million
in the quarter, compared to $76 million for the same period a year
earlier. For the year, the division lost $222 million, compared to
profits of $127 million in 1988.
   McDonnell Douglas is the nation's second largest maker of
commerical aircraft.

   Neil Bush said Friday that his father, the
president, told him to ``do what's right'' when the younger Bush
said he intends to fight conflict-of-interest charges leveled by
federal thrift regulators.
   The decision may put the president in the awkward position of
appointing the official likely to decide the case, but Neil Bush
said after talking to his father earlier in the day that he did not
believe the matter would pose a problem.
   ``He's giving me the same advice he has given me for 35 years:
Do what's right. And I'm doing what's right,'' the president's son
told a news conference in Denver.
   ``I will fight and ... although I know that taking on the feds
is tough ... I intend to win.''
   The Office of Thrift Supervision said Friday it will issue a
``notice of charges'' alleging that actions by the younger Bush as
a director of a Colorado savings and loan ``amounted to conflicts
of interest.''
   The announcement came after the president's son refused to
voluntarily accept an order from regulators directing him to
refrain from actions amounting to a conflict of interest if, in the
future, he becomes an officer of a savings and loan, a bank or a
credit union.
   ``I believe in the principle that if you haven't done anything
wrong, don't do anything that might be an admission of
wrongdoing,'' Neil Bush said.
   He was a director of the failed Silverado Banking, Savings and
Loan Association in Denver from 1985 until August 1988, resigning
two weeks before his father accepted the GOP presidential
nomination.
   According to Karl Hoyle, senior deputy director of the thrift
office, the younger Bush's stance triggers an administrative
process that typically lasts a year and could stretch to as long as
two years if initial rulings are appealed.
   Hoyle said the thrift office will ask an administrative law
judge to hold a hearing on the notice of charges and recommend to
thrift office director M. Danny Wall that a cease-and-desist order
be issued against the president's son.
   But Wall, a Reagan administration appointee who announced his
resignation last month, almost certainly will have left the agency
by then, passing on the case to a new thrift office director, who
must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said, ``The president's
decision on a nominee for the thrift office will be made completely
independently of this or any other case.''
   The December 1988 collapse of Silverado, now operating as part
of Columbia Savings, the largest thrift in Colorado, is expected to
cost taxpayers up to $1 billion.
   Hoyle said the agency expected to make public the specific
charges against Neil Bush after they are filed. The agency has
focused its investigation of Silverado on what it said was ``an
exceptionally large number of problem transactions'' between
Silverado insiders and borrowers.
   The younger Bush was a partner in an oil exploration firm, JNB
Exploration, with two of Silverado's major borrowers, developers
Bill L. Walters and Ken Good. In a statement Thursday, however,
Bush said there was nothing improper with the connection.
   ``Bill Walters had a passive 6.25 percent limited partnership
interest in JNB Exploration,'' the president's son said. ``Because
I did not benefit directly or indirectly from any loan or
transaction between Silverado and businesses controlled by Bill
Walters, as an outside director I voted in 1986 with the other
directors in unanimously approving the Walters loans and
transactions brought to us by management.''
   Good, according to Neil Bush, had a more active interest in the
financing and management of JNB Exploration and ``as a result, I
abstained on all votes concerning Good.''
   Earlier this month, the thrift office announced that five
officers of Silverado had accepted orders banning them for life
from working for a federally insured financial institution without
permission from regulators.
   Hoyle said the agency does not believe it has the grounds to
seek that more severe penalty against the president's son.
   He noted that any thrift office action does not preclude a civil
suit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. seeking damages from
Silverado's officers and directors in compensation for taxpayer
losses incurred in the bailout. Nor does it preclude any criminal
charges if evidence indicates they are warranted.
   The administrative cease-and-desist order being pursued against
Neil Bush would enable the thrift office to seek fines up to $1
million a day for future violations, according to Rosemary Stewart,
thrift office enforcement director.
   ``Out of the whole arsenal, this is the mildest form of
enforcement,'' said Warren L. Dennis, a Washington attorney
specializing in S&amp;L law. ``It's not even a stun gun or a rubber
bullet.''
   Dennis said both Neil Bush and the government are in a difficult
position.
   ``The government is pursuing these types of orders even for
passive directors and they feel they cannot make an exception for
the president's son, who is in the position of many of these
directors of not wanting to accept even a pro forma slap on the
wrist because they feel they've done nothing wrong,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories plans to announce
the development of a computer that runs on photons instead of
electrons, creating the potential for vastly more powerful
computers, an official said Friday.
   The company has set a news conference for Monday, but refused to
comment on its subject matter.
   But an industry official familiar with the research, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, confirmed the conference would be about
the creation of a ``photonic'' computer.
   Such a computer would transmit information with photons, the
fundamental particles of light, rather than electronic impulses.
   The prototype to be unveiled Monday is a fairly rudimentary
device that runs at a low level of power, but is believed to be the
first to run on photons, the official said.
   Scientists believe such computers some day may run at speeds
thousands of times faster than today's versions.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Grabill Corp. Chairman William Stoecker
was acquitted Friday on six counts of bankruptcy fraud in
connection with the collapse of his financial empire.
   A U.S. District Court jury deliberated for six hours before
returning the not-guilty verdicts for Stoecker, 32, who was charged
with failing to disclose $255,000 to the bankruptcy trustee
appointed to oversee his estate.
   Until his troubles surfaced last year, Stoecker had a reputation
as a financial genius who had built a multimillion-dollar
conglomerate of 22 manufacturing and retail companies, all acquired
in leveraged buyouts.
   But his financial empire began to crumble in December 1988 when
he was unable to make full payment on a $150 million loan.
   A nine-bank consortium that loaned Stoecker the money forced the
conglomerate into bankruptcy in early 1989 after finding that $100
million in assets had disappeared. Stoecker also went into personal
bankruptcy.
   He was charged last April with bankruptcy fraud. Prosecutors
said he concealed assets to maintain a lavish lifestyle that
include mansions, airplanes and expensive art.
   The government alleged Stoecker contributed $140,000 to a bank
account he created in his maid's name. They also said he hid
another $115,000 in a safe in his suburban home.
   But during the week-long trial, Durkin contended that government
witnesses lied and that attorneys who testified against Stoecker
were trying to protect legal fees exceeding $1 million from the
bankruptcy proceedings.
   Some of Stoecker's friends and relatives in the courtroom burst
into tears when the verdicts were read. Afterward, Stoecker said he
felt ``oustanding.''

<HEAD>RJR Nabisco Junk Bonds Tumble After Ratings Downgrade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc.'s junk bonds, previously a
stalwart in the volatile high-yield debt market, fell sharply
Friday after Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its rating of
the company's debt.
   Analysts said some of RJR Nabisco's junk bonds fell 10 percent
in value. The rest of the high-yield market also declined, but not
as severely.
   Moody's lowered its ratings on RJR Nabisco's outstanding debt
and assigned a lower-than-expected rating to an upcoming $1.25
billion bond issue the company plans.
   Jim Lewis, a corporate bond trader with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said RJR Nabisco's bonds _ which helped finance
the record $24.53 billion leveraged buyout of food and tobacco
company _ were hurt by the downgrade, but also have fallen this
week in response to volatility in the stock market.
   Friday's decline reversed a trend in high-yield trading. RJR
Nabisco's bonds fared better than other issues recently when the
junk bond market plunged in response to the failure of Campeau
Corp.'s buyout of Federated Department Stores Inc.
   ``The (RJR Nabisco bonds) don't look as good as they used to,''
Lewis said.
   The bonds declined although RJR Nabisco securities received
somewhat more favorable ratings from two other companies, Standard
&amp; Poor's Corp. and Fitch Investors Service Inc.
   Lewis said the Moody's rating meant that the purchasers of the
new $1.25 billion issue likely would have to be the same investors
who were willing to take a risk on the earlier $4 billion in bonds.
Traders had hoped to see a bigger market for the new bonds, he said.
   ``The perception is, now you've shifted the major buying
responsibility to the junkier section of the market,'' he said.
   RJR Nabisco said months ago it planned the new issue to
refinance some of its debt after completing $5.4 billion in asset
sales required under its loan agreements with major banks.
   Moody's said uncertainties about the cash flow of RJR Nabisco's
tobacco business over the long-term led it to lower its ratings,
although Moody's analyst Gloria Vila said, ``We recognize that
certain near-term risks have been alleviated.''
   She credited RJR Nabisco for successfully completing its asset
divestiture program and selecting a good management team. But she
said the firm _ like other tobacco companies _ faces the problem of
fewer smokers and possibly lower profits in the years ahead.
   Furthermore, she said RJR Nabisco has had more success with some
of its lower-priced brands, such as Doral cigarettes, than with
higher-margin products, such as Winston.
   RJR Nabisco spokesman David Kalis said the company could not
comment on Moody's action because the firm was required to remain
silent while the $1.25 billion in bonds were awaiting approval from
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Standard &amp; Poor's said it had completed a review of RJR Nabisco
and had affirmed its rating of the company's debt. William
Wetreich, a Standard &amp; Poor's spokesman, said his firm had no plans
to further review RJR Nabisco's rating.
   Standard &amp; Poor's noted concerns about the tobacco business, but
``the company's strong tobacco cash flows are still expected to
continue growing.''
   The rating service also gave the new bond issue a speculative
grade.
   Fitch assigned the new issue its highest rating for speculative,
or high-yield, debt. This was the first rating Fitch has made of
RJR Nabisco bonds. The company only recently began evaluating the
high-yield market.

   The U.S. economy slowed almost to a standstill
in the last three months of 1989, registering a barely perceptible
0.5 percent annual growth rate that was the poorest since the
spring of 1986.
   The Commerce Department on Friday blamed the big drop-off in
growth from October through December on a rare decline in consumer
spending, a deteriorating trade deficit and a slump in business
investment spending.
   For the year as a whole, the GNP grew by 2.9 percent, following
a much more rapid 4.4 percent increase in 1988. It was the slowest
annual growth rate since a 2.7 percent rise in 1986.

<HEAD>Huntsman, GE Division Propose Joint Venture To Acquire Aristech</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Utah chemical magnate Jon Huntsman and a
General Electric Co. division said Friday they are attempting to
form a 50-50 joint venture that could acquire Aristech Chemical
Corp. for more than $899 million.
   Huntsman Holdings Corp. and GE Plastics of Pittsfield, Mass.,
said the proposal could enable Huntsman to boost his offer for
Aristech from $25 a share to at least $26 a share, according to a
letter the Salt Lake City businessman mailed to Aristech board
member R.S. Evans.
   Aristech spokesman David Higie declined to comment Friday.
   Huntsman is in a bidding war for Aristech with Mitsubishi Corp.
of Japan and Aristech's senior management, which last week offered
$26 a share. The senior management group is led by Aristech
Chairman Thomas Marshall.
   Aristech has about 32 million outstanding shares, or the
equivalent of about 34.6 million fully diluted outstanding shares.
Aristech stock dropped 12{ cents Friday in New York Stock Exchange
trading to $25.12{.
   Huntsman's $25-a-share offer, worth about $865 million, was
rejected in November.
   Aristech's board in effect rejected the Mitsubishi-management
bid on Wednesday when it announced it would seek bids from buyers
willing to pay more than $26 a share. The board set a bidding
deadline for 5 p.m. Monday.
   In his letter, Huntsman asked Aristech to extend the deadline
until Feb. 20 to give him more time to review Aristech's financial
condition and form the joint venture.
   ``Unfortunately, the 5 p.m. Jan. 29 deadline for the submission
of bids, as set forth in your Jan. 24 letter to me, will not afford
us an adequate opportunity to conduct the necessary review,''
Huntsman wrote.
   ``In view of Mitsubishi Corp.'s and Aristech management's
lengthy period to conduct a complete review of Aristech, fairness
dictates that we be afforded a reasonable due diligence review
period,'' the letter said.
   Huntsman has signed an agreement not to accumulate additional
Aristech stock unless he offers to buy all outstanding stock for
$25 per share or more. Huntsman currently owns 8.7 percent of the
company's stock, according to Huntsman spokesman Joele Frank.
   In Securities and Exchange Commission documents filed Thursday,
Huntsman said he has signed a confidentiality agreement in return
for receiving confidential financial data about the company.
   Much of Aristech's holdings are former USX Chemical Corp.
properties. The company employs about 1,800 people at 10 plants in
eight states.

<HEAD>Actor Newman, Actress Streep to Appear in American Express
Commercials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Paul Newman and actress Meryl Streep will
be making their first appearances ever in U.S. TV commercials later
this year in ads for American Express Cards, the financial services
company said Thursday.
   Newman's commercial will debut on the CBS broadcast of the Super
Bowl football championship game this Sunday, American Express said.
   Streep has been filmed for a commercial that is expected to be
aired later in the year, according to spokeswoman Gail Wasserman of
American Express Travel-Related Services Co. Inc. Wasserman
declined to say how much the actors had been paid for their
appearances.
   The commercials are being billed as ``Video Portraits,'' and are
the first video takeoffs on the highly-acclaimed series of print
ads that American Express has done in recent years, featuring
distinctive photographs of well-known people who have been longtime
cardholders.
   Former House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill, for instance,
was shown seated under a beach umbrella playing cards in hand in
one ad.
   In another print ad, former basketball star Wilt Chamberlain and
jockey Willie Shoemaker were photographed together, each dressed in
white suits. Actress Candice Bergen was in another ad, riding a
horse.
   The use of famous stars on TV represents a notable departure for
American Express. Until a few years ago, the company was best known
for its long-running campaign featuring obscure faces introducing
themselves by saying, ``Do you know me?''
   Newman doesn't say a word in his 60-second commercial, which
will be run during the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl broadcast.
   The ad opens with Newman, a racing car enthusiast and cardmember
since 1966, zipping up his leather jacket, pulling on some racing
gloves and heading for the track.
   He is handed a miniature motorcyle, and it soon becomes evident
that he is expected to ride it in a race against a high-powered car.
   Can you guess who wins?

<HEAD>Rorer's Net Income Up 40 Percent in 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WASHINGTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rorer Group Inc., which last week
announced plans to merge with a French pharmaceutical firm, said
Thursday its earnings rose 66 percent in the fourth quarter and 40
percent in 1989, in part because of a fee for terminating an
earlier merger pact with another drug company.
   Net income jumped to $44.7 million, or $1.38 a share, in the
fourth quarter from $26.9 million, or 85 cents a share a year
earlier. Sales grew 24 percent to $403 million from $325 million.
   For all of 1989, the suburban Philadelphia company reported net
income rose to $86.5 million, or $2.67 a share, from $61.8 million,
or $1.96 a share, in 1988. Sales increased 13 percent to $1.18
billion from $1.04 billion.
   The 1989 earnings include a pre-tax gain of $19.9 million. That
reflected a fee paid by A.H. Robins Co. Inc. in the fourth quarter
for breaking off a merger agreement with Rorer in favor of one with
American Home Products Corp.
   On Jan. 18, Rorer announced it agreed to merge with the drug
operations of Rhone-Poulenc. The $3 billion deal would give the
French company 68 percent of Rorer's stock, leaving the rest in
public hands. The resulting firm would be one of the world's 10
largest pharmaceutical companies.
   The gain was partially offset by almost $10 million in
restructuring costs for Rorer's European facilities.
   ``It was an exceptionally good year for us around the world,''
said Rorer's chairman and chief executive officer, Robert E.
Cawthorn. ``We achieved strong results even though we invested
heavily in marketing programs and research and development to
ensure a prosperous future.''
   Cawthorn said results benefited from a 46 percent increase in
sales of Rorer's calcitonin drugs, used to treat the degenerative
bone disease osteoporosis.
   Sales of Maalox antacid, the company's best-known product, grew
19 percent in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, he
said.
   Rorer stock closed unchanged Thursday at $61 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

   Fast-food giant McDonald's Corp. said
Thursday its earnings rose 13 percent in the fourth quarter and for
all of 1989, a year in which it opened the most restaurants in its
history.
   The quarter ending Dec. 31 was the 99th consecutive quarter of
record operating results, the company said.
   ``I can think of no better testament to our growth strategy than
our achievements in this decade,'' Chairman Fred L. Turner said in
a statement.
   Earnings in the fourth quarter rose to $171 million, or 46 cents
a share, from $151.5 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenues rose 9 percent to $1.58 billion from $1.45 billion.
   Net income for 1989 was $726.7 million, or $1.95 a share,
compared with $645.9 million, or $1.71 a share, a year earlier.
Revenues rose 10 percent to $6.14 billion from $5.57 billion.
   ``McDonald's performance in 1989 reflects several milestones,''
President and Chief Executive Officer Michael R. Quinlan said.
``The 11,000th restaurant opened in Hong Kong and we added 649
restaurants, which was more than in any year in our history.''
   The restaurant company, which has franchises and affiliates in
many countries around the world, opened in 1955.

   Producer Francis Ford Coppola and his

laws Thursday, court officials said.
   Coppola and Zoetrope Productions filed separately under Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Act, said the clerk's office at U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Santa Rosa.
   Zoetrope, based in San Francisco, listed assets of $22.2 million
and debts of $28.9 million. It identified its largest creditors as
Hot Weather Films-Pony Boy Inc., $16.2 million, and Orion Pictures,
$6.2 million.
   Coppola, director of ``The Godfather,'' did not total his assets
or liabilities in his filing, which was also under the business
names of Sophia Properties and Niebaum Coppola Estates. He listed a
$3 million debt to Darion Development of Los Angeles.
   Zoetrope said it would issue a statement later Thursday.

fourth quarter and 43 percent in 1989 because of the costs of
product transitions and development of its new Cray-3 computer.

Teledyne said. Shareholders will receive one Unitrin share for each
Teledyne share held. The shares will be distributed on a post-split

   The insurance and finance units accounted for $1.1 billion of
Teledyne's $3.5 billion in sales in 1989.

<HEAD>Nevada Gaming Commission OKs Holiday Corp. Restructuring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN GRIFFITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nevada Gaming Commission on
Thursday gave final approval to a restructuring of Holiday Corp.,
clearing the way for the hotel and gaming company to sell its
Holiday Inn chain to Bass PLC of Britain.
   Under the restructuring, Holiday Corp. will retain three other
fast-growing hotel chains and its Harrah's casinos in Nevada and
New Jersey and operate under the new name of Promus Companies Inc.
   The gaming operations will account for 80 percent of Promus'
revenues, with the Embassy Suites, Homewood Suites and Hampton Inns
chains making up the remainder.
   Holiday Corp. had agreed to sell Holiday Inn to Bass for about
$2.2 billion pending regulatory approval. Shareholders endorsed the
plan Jan. 17, and Nevada's Gaming Control Board and New Jersey's
Casino Control Commission gave their approval previously.
   ``Promus will have a more concentrated commitment to the gaming
industry ... and increased financial strength,'' commission
Chairman John O'Reilly said following Thursday's vote. ``It appears
it's not only in the best interests of the shareholders, but in the
best interests of the gaming industry of Nevada.''
   Holiday Corp. officials said the firm decided to sell its
interest in more than 1,400 Holiday Inn hotels because they were
competing for capital against its casinos and other hotels.
   Harrah's President Phil Satre said the company is committed to
its casinos in Nevada and New Jersey, and the restructuring would
allow it to continue with capital improvements at each in the
future.
   ``We are proud of a record of success in gaming in Nevada and
New Jersey,'' Satre said. ``We are confident of the future and we
are confident we can do it in the form of the Promus companies.''
   Commission members approved the plan after Holiday officials
said their legal and accounting experts assured them the
transaction would be tax-free. Holiday officials said they didn't
want to wait for an Internal Revenue Service ruling because it
could take up to eight months.
   Holiday officials also told the commission that the deal with
Bass PLC places no limits on Promus' ability to construct new
casinos.
   Under the restructuring, Promus will borrow about $900 million
to give shareholders and top company officials a special dividend
of about $30 per share. The deal is expected to net company
officials millions.
   New Jersey gaming regulators raised concerns that management
might profit unduly from the plan, but Nevada gaming regulators did
not raise the issue during special hearings this week.
