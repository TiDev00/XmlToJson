   Sen. Bill Bradley breezed to victory Tuesday
in a barely contested Democratic primary and will face Republican
Christine Todd Whitman in the November general election.
   With 65 percent of the precincts reporting, Bradley had 114,942
votes, or 94 percent, to 7,354 votes, or 6 percent, for Daniel
Seyler, a political unknown.
   Mrs. Whitman, former president of the state Board of Public
Utilities and a former Somerset County official, had no primary
opposition.
   At an appropriately low-key victory reception in Woodbridge,
Bradley said, ``I'm very pleased to again be the standard-bearer for
the Democratic Party in the Senate election.''
   Seyler, 35, of Phillipsburg, spent about $1,300 of his own money
and raised $83.57 from contributors in a campaign whose major issue
was limiting federal officeholders to 12 years in office.
   Democratic Gov. Jim Florio's gubernatorial opponent, Rep. James
Courter, who lost in a landslide, didn't seek re-election to his
12th District seat.
   State Sen. Richard A. Zimmer won the Republican primary for
Courter's seat, defeating former New York Giants receiver Phil
McConkey and two other candidates. With 67 percent of the precincts
reporting, Zimmer had 40 percent of the vote to 30 percent for
McConkey and 28 percent for Assemblyman Rodney Frelinghuysen, who
had been considered the favorite to win the nomination.
   Businesswoman and philanthropist Marguerite Chandler defeated
little known James J. Cleary in the Democratic primary for the seat.

   Bradley, 46, of Denville, has a bankroll of $10 million-plus. His
focus in the Senate has included foreign debt and Soviet affairs.
   He sidesteps talk that he may seek the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1992, saying he plans to serve out his six-year Senate
term if he wins re-election.
   Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, a Republican, has said that Mrs.
Whitman, 43, of Far Hills, offers GOP voters a choice for voters.
But even Kean has called Bradley unbeatable.

   A farmer returned a bald eagle to the
wild Tuesday, two days after Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
flew off without stopping by as planned to do the honors as a symbol
of superpower friendship.
   Richard Brand's farm was scratched from Gorbachev's whirlwind
tour at the last minute. But television cameras, a small crowd and
Gov. Rudy Perpich looked on and applauded Tuesday as the bird
flapped eastward from the farm about 20 miles south of Minneapolis.
   ``I'm more comfortable with cows,'' quipped Brand, a dairy
farmer, just before the U.S. symbol was set in his arms and released.
   Brand emphasized he was not bitter about not playing host to
Gorbachev.
   ``At least I got some work done,'' he said, referring to the help
he got from the summit advance team in sprucing up the farm. In an
earlier interview, he said the visit only sped up planned
improvements.
   The eagle, named ``Spirit Lake'' after the site in Iowa where she
was found, had been recovering at the University of Minnesota Raptor
Center from insecticide poisoning.

<HEAD>Government to Charge Enrile With Rebellion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN GUERRERO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will file new charges
accusing Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile of participating in December's
failed coup, an official said Wednesday.
   The move comes a day after the Supreme Court rejected a previous
indictment against Enrile and 22 others, saying the charges were
legally invalid.
   Enrile and the others were charged with rebellion combined with
murder in connection with the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt that left 113
people dead and more than 600 wounded.
   On Tuesday, Chief Justice Marcelo Fernan said the Supreme Court
voted 11-2 against reviewing a 1956 court decision, thereby
overturning the combined charges. Two justices were absent or
abstained, Fernan said.
   Presidential Press Secretary Tomas Gomez said the government had
enough evidence to charge Enrile with the lesser charge of
rebellion. Murder is punishable by life imprisonment, but rebellion
carries a prison sentence of six to 12 years.
   ``The quality of the evidence has not been diminished
whatsoever,'' Gomez said in a radio interview Wednesday. ``The
government will now file a case based on rebellion.''
   In 1956, the court ruled that killings occurring during an armed
uprising should be treated differently than crimes with common
motives. The court said defendants should be charged with rebellion
and not murder.
   Defendants in rebellion cases are allowed bail. Bail is generally
denied in murder cases.
   Mrs. Aquino's legal adviser, Adolfo Azcuna, said the government
may seek reconsideration. In the Philippines, Supreme Court rulings
become final after 10 days, during which parties to the case can ask
for reconsideration.
   In editorials Wednesday, several newspapers accused Mrs. Aquino
of poor judgment in charging Enrile with the combined offense.
   The Daily Globe, published by Mrs. Aquino's former speechwriter
Teodoro Locsin, said the government ``had lost and lost miserably.''
   Sen. John Osmena said the ruling meant the government's ``attempt
to bend the law to intimidate those who do not agree with the
administration has been foiled.''
   After the vote, Enrile said: ``I think the Supreme Court,
although the members are all appointees of President Aquino, remains
faithful to their role as guardians of liberty. I am happy for the
country.''
   Enrile, a former defense minister, was arrested in February. The
Supreme Court released him on bail two weeks later pending a
decision on the validity of the charge.
   Enrile has denied any role in the uprising. Enrile played a key
role in the 1986 military mutiny that triggered the ``people power''
revolution that propelled Mrs. Aquino to power.
   Enrile was fired in November 1986 after a failed coup by his
followers.

   Ricky Van Shelton was chosen entertainer
of the Year and top male vocalist Monday night at the 24th annual
fan-voted TNN-Music City News Country Awards Show.
   Randy Travis, who was top entertainer the previous two years, won
nothing despite being a finalist in five categories.
   ``I'm shocked, really shocked,'' Shelton said after the ceremony.
``I'm really, totally in awe.
   Patty Loveless was named female vocalist of the year, supplanting
Reba McEntire, who had won the award five straight years.
   ``This tells me the people believe in the music I'm doing,''
Loveless said.
   The Statler Brothers were double winners, winning the vocal group
award for the seventh straight time and copping single honors for
``More Than a Name on the Wall.''
   Hank Williams Jr. and his late father also were double winners,
for video and vocal collaboration for ``There's a Tear in My Beer.''
   The video combines film of the father with shots of the son.
   Rising star Clint Black was honored twice, as star of tomorrow
honor and for top album, ``Killin' Time.''
   ``I hate to mention that word `star,' but if you force it on me,
I'll take it,'' Black said.
   Tennessee Ernie Ford was presented with the Minnie Pearl award
for dedication to the music business and humanitarian efforts during
a career that has spanned 50 years.
   ``If I ever felt like a milk bucket under a bull, it's right
now,'' the joyous Ford said in accepting the honor.
   Veteran Merle Haggard, best known for ``Okie From Muskogee,''
received the living legend award.
   Other winners included: The Judds for vocal duo; Ray Stevens for
comedian; Ricky Skaggs for instrumentalist and The Chuck Wagon Gang
for gospel group.
   The winners were chosen by subscribers to the Music City News, a
monthly country music publication, and viewers of The Nashville
Network, a cable station that televised the two-hour ceremony live.

   Former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein
took an early lead over Attorney General John Van de Kamp on Tuesday
in a hotly contested race for the Democratic nomination for
governor. Voters also considered a proposal to double state gasoline
taxes.
   With 1 percent of the precincts reporting, Feinstein had 49,557
votes, or 52 percent, to Van de Kamp's 40,271 votes, or 42 percent.
   The Feinstein-Van de Kamp race headlined a lengthy state ballot,
with U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson facing only token opposition for the GOP
nomination for governor.
   One ballot measure called for raising the gas tax from 9 to 18
cents per gallon to renew a financially starved highway building
program. It was ahead in the early returns, with 100,425 yes votes,
or 53 percent, to 88,327 no votes, or 47 percent.
   Other state races featured new political faces with familiar
family names.
   In the Republican race for state treasurer, incumbent Tom Hayes
led Angela ``Bay'' Buchanan, former U.S. treasurer and sister of
conservative commentator Pat Buchanan, by a 65-to-35 percent margin.
Kathleen Brown, daughter of former Gov. Pat Brown and sister of
former Gov. Jerry Brown, was leading the Democratic treasurer's race
against Wesley Sanders Jr. by 59 percent to 41 percent.
   Two other statewide races had a unique family tie.
   Democratic Secretary of State March Fong Eu was seeking a fifth
term as the state's chief election officer and highest ranking
Chinese-American official, while her son, Matt Fong, was unopposed
for the Republican nomination for state controller.
   California's 45 congressional races included several interesting
contests:
   _Democratic incumbent Jim Bates faced a strong challenge in a San
Diego primary because of his formal rebuke by the House Ethics
Committee for sexual harassment of women employees;
   _Actor Ralph Waite, ``Papa Walton'' of the television series, was
seeking the Democratic nomination for a seat now held by Republican
Al McCandless in the Palm Springs area;
   _Tim Stoen, former attorney for People's Temple before the cult's
mass suicide with 912 deaths over a decade ago, was seeking the
Republican nomination to oppose Democratic incumbent Doug Bosco in
California's north coast redwood country.
   In other local races, attorney William Graysen, who represented
actress Zsa Zsa Gabor in her cop-slapping trial, was running for a
state Senate seat from Beverly Hills, and Oakland Mayor Lionel
Wilson was the underdog in his re-election bid because of the
controversy over his part in Oakland's failed bid to bring the Los
Angeles Raiders back to Oakland.
   The proposed gas tax hike, which would mark a symbolic end to the
tax revolt that began with passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, was
among several measures on the statewide ballot.
   Companion bond measures would start a multibillion-dollar program
of new commuter train service.
   Another ballot proposition would take control of reapportionment
of congressional and legislative districts out the hands of the
Democratic leadership of the Legislature.

   Feinstein's bid for the Democratic nomination for governor marked
the first serious attempt by a woman to win California's chief job,
a fact that overshadowed most other issues in her race against Van
de Kamp, a less telegenic but politically well-connected prosecutor.
   Abortion was a major issue for all of the major candidates to
succeed retiring Republican George Deukmejian as governor, even
though all three were pro-choice.
   Feinstein and Van de Kamp competed over who was the most
effective champion of a woman's right to choose. The limited
opposition raised in the GOP primary against Wilson, a moderate
Republican who never touted his pro-choice stand, came from
anti-abortion activists.
   Norma McCorvey, the ``Jane Roe'' in Roe vs. Wade, the U.S.
Supreme Court case that established a woman's right to an abortion,
made a last-minute campaign appearance for Van de Kamp.
   Feinstein campaigned as tough on crime, trying to seize an issue
that seemed more likely to belong to her opponent.
   She ran a late-campaign TV ad criticizing Van de Kamp for
declining to prosecute a suspect in the Hillside Strangler case in
which 10 people were killed. Van de Kamp was the Los Angeles
district attorney at the time, and the suspect, Angelo Buono, was
later convicted of murder after the state attorney general stepped
into the case.
   Van de Kamp called the criticism ``baloney.''
   The gasoline tax measure, Proposition 111, marked a political
turning point for the state.
   Opponents noted that the measure, which would raise $15.5 billion
over the next decade, would be the largest tax hike in the state's
history. Supporters warned that defeat of the proposal would bring
California's highway construction program to a halt during an era of
the fastest population growth in decades.

   While other world leaders fight to stay
in power, and some try to fend off reform, the head of the world's 6
million Tibetans has the opposite problem.
   The Dalai Lama's people are uncomfortable with democracy and do
not want him to retire as their political leader.
   But then, most other political figures aren't considered living
gods.
   ``I am insisting on stepping down,'' the Dalai Lama said in an
interview. ``It is of greatest urgency that democracy comes to us.
It is the most creative way for the human spirit.''
   In his ornate parlor overlooking the snow-capped Himalayas, the
Dalai Lama predicted communism soon would fall in China and his
followers would return to their homeland within 10 years.
   Tibetans believe their mountainous region, with its unique
culture, should be an independent nation. China claims Tibet has
been part of its territory since the 13th century.
   To prepare for their return, the Dalai Lama said, Tibetans must
embrace democracy and shed the idea that he is a god.
   It is proving difficult. There is strong conservative opposition
to the Dalai Lama's plans to democratize his government-in-exile and
few, if any, Tibetans seem willing to abandon the belief that ``His
Holiness'' is divine.
   That belief has made Tibetans ``lazy,'' said the 54-year-old
Buddhist leader, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize. ``They think I
will do everything for them.''
   Tibetans circle his residence, pausing to clasp their hands in
prayer. Elderly women, limping with age, climb steep grades to gaze
at his compound, whispering ``10,000 years to His Holiness.''
   Tibetan Buddhist tradition holds that the first Dalai Lama, born
in 1391, was a reincarnation of Chenresi, the Buddhist god of mercy.
Subsequent Dalai Lamas are revered as reincarnations of their
predecessors.
   The current Dalai Lama, the 14th, was chosen in 1936 after a
series of visions indicated the leader would be found in a house
with turquoise tiles in eastern Tibet.
   When he first told Tibetans of his wish to give up his political
position, the Dalai Lama said, ``many people were shocked and they
told me I should not say this kind of thing.
   ``But I continuously spoke out,'' he said, with a playful grin.
   He remains a reluctant politician, a man of the spirit, not of
law or intrigue. Clothed in maroon and saffron robes and wearing his
ever-present tinted glasses, the Dalai Lama chuckled, cracked jokes
and reached out to squeeze the hand of a reporter as he made a point.
   ``I am just a Tibetan monk,'' he said, running his fingers over
wooden prayer beads. ``I would rather go to an isolated monastery
and pray. Now I have no time for prayer. I am always busy, busy with
the affairs of this world.''

   A scandal involving money and secrets
from Taiwan has started a fight in the Tibetan independemce movement
that threatens gains made since the Dalai Lama, its leader, won the
Nobel Peace Prize last year.
   The scandal has alienated many Tibetan refugees, causing what one
young Tibetan called ``a big gap between us and our leaders.''
   On one side are liberals who favor talks with China and making
the Tibetan movement more democratic. The Dalai Lama, spiritual and
temporal leader of the world's 6 million Tibetans, leads this group.
   On the other are conservatives who oppose contacts with the
Chinese and attempts to reform the government-in-exile. Conservative
Buddhist monks and older Tibetan officials lead them.
   ``It's a little Iran-Contra scandal,'' said Tendzin Choegyal, the
Dalai Lama's youngest brother. ``To the average Tibetan, this is a
very confusing and troubling time.''
   Tattered wall posters along the road to this retreat in the
Himalayan foothills attest to the problem.
   ``Traitors, you have sold out Tibet,'' they read. ``China lovers,
we will never forget your deeds.''
   ``Both Chinas must be laughing their heads off,'' said an
editorial in the Tibetan Review, the movement's official publication.
   The scandal emerged last year when Tibetan officials began
accusing each other of being on Taiwan's payroll.
   It revolves around the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission,
a Taiwanese government agency. Like its communist enemy in Beijing,
the government of Taiwan claims Tibet is part of China and rejects
Tibetan independence.
   Since 1959, when the Dalai Lama fled China after an abortive
uprising and set up headquarters in Dharmsala, Taiwan has donated
``hundreds of millions'' of dollars to Tibetan groups, according to
Sonam Tobgyal, spokesman for the exile government.
   He said the Taiwanese agency aims to convince Tibetans to break
with the government-in-exile, which Taiwan denies.
   Gene J.Y. Chang, head of the agency, said it had given much less
to the Tibetans _ an average of $300,000 a year.
   In an interview in Taipei, Chang acknowledged some Tibetan
refugees were anti-Chinese, not merely anti-communist, but said the
commission would like to improve its relations with Dharmsala.
   Tobgyal said the commission had become increasingly active in
recent years, financing a Tibetan-language newspaper in Calcutta,
building monasteries in Nepal and granting scholarships to Tibetan
students.
   ``The main aim of the money has been to create disharmony among
Tibetans,'' Tobgyal said.
   He claimed Taiwan paid independence activists to return to Tibet
and ``stir up trouble,'' thus violating the Dalai Lama's policy of
non-violence. Taiwan denies the charge.
   The reasons for Taiwan's alleged meddling are not clear.
   It could seek to foment further political turmoil on the Chinese
mainland by encouraging protests in Tibet, but also might be
currying favor with Beijing by trying to weaken the Tibetan
movement. Taiwan recently abandoned its ``no contact'' policy toward
the mainland.
   A further complication is the relationship between the security
agencies of Taiwan and the Tibetan exile government.
   Since 1986, Dharmsala has provided Taiwan with details about
Tibet in exchange for Taiwanese intelligence about political changes
in China, Tobgyal said. He defended the exchange, but granted that
it raised eyebrows among Tibetans.
   In a speech to his Cabinet in January, the Dalai Lama said the
scandal had caused ``a loss of faith in the Tibetan
administration.'' He forbade unofficial contacts with Taiwan and
established a committee to investigate previous dealings.
   ``We are wasting the best opportunity we ever had within these 30
years on minor issues,'' he said.
   At risk are gains made since the awarding of the prize focused
attention on Tibet, where Chinese troops have killed scores of
pro-independence activists in the past two years. Lhasa, Tibet's
capital, had been under martial law for 13 months when it was lifted
May 1.
   There also is concern that the conservative faction might try to
take advantage of the disunity and get the Dalai Lama's concessions
to China retracted, which would scuttle dreams of an early return to
Tibet.
   In a 1988 speech, the Dalai Lama said he was willing to give
China control over Tibet's foreign affairs and defense in exchange
for autonomy in internal matters.
   The Dalai Lama recently fired several top officials, including
his representative in Tokyo, in an attempt to end the crisis. He
dissolved the Cabinet and instituted reforms designed to open the
exile government to public scrutiny.
   Voting by 368 Tibetan representatives from around the world May
14 in Dharmsala filled only three of the seven Cabinet seats. At
least nine candidates dropped out and some representatives handed in
empty ballots to express opposition to the reforms.

   It's raz, dva, tri strikes, ``You're out!'' at
Moscow State University, where Soviets were learning the American
national pastime while President Mikhail S. Gorbachev toured the
American heartland.
   The Soviets started playing baseball four years ago, hoping to
field a team at the Summer Games in 1992 when it will be a medal
sport for the first time.
   But hopes are not high on the astroturf at a 1,000-seat baseball
stadium built on the university grounds last September.
   ``I don't think a Soviet team will make it to the Olympics this
time around,'' said Alexander E. Semyonov.
   ``The American, Cuban and Nicaraguan teams are much stronger,''
said Semyonov, who calls himself ``the only Soviet baseball
writer.'' His articles appear in the monthly ``Sport'' magazine.
   ``The big problem is that we don't have many fans,'' Semyonov
said in an interview Monday. ``They don't really understand the
rules. For example, they don't know what a ball is. Or a strike.''
   In a game Sunday, about half the seats were empty, including
those directly behind home plate. They are considered choice spots
in U.S. ballparks but shunned by Soviets because of the protective
wire screen. Fans seem to prefer taking their chances with fly balls
along the foul line.
   Otherwise, the scene was much the same as at a high school or
small college ballpark in the United States. Fans wore the caps of
their favorite teams. The men went shirtless and the women wore
halter tops and basked in the early summer sun.
   It is strictly bring-your-own hot dog at Moscow stadium, which
has no concessions.
   Cheers and jeers in Russian, English and Spanish rose from the
stands as the Red Devils of the Moscow Chemical-Technical Institute
ran up a 10-2 score against last year's national champions, the Army
Sports Club of Balashikhov, known by its Russian acronym SKA.
   ``They tried what is called a double play,'' intoned the Soviet
announcer, as the SKA second baseman handled a toss from the
shortstop, turned the force at the bag, then buried his throw to
first base in the dirt.
   The announcer, sprawled in the stands, wore shorts and a blue
cap. He mixed his commentary with warnings about pop foul balls that
sailed over a low screen and bounced among cars parked next to the
stands.
   The stadium itself is vulnerable to the pop foul: glass skylights
on either side of home plate sport neat round holes, a danger
apparently not foreseen by contractors.
   The ballplayers themselves occupy the semi-professional gray area
typical of Soviet sports.
   ``They are amateurs, and have other jobs. But it's hard to say
how hard they work,'' said Semyonov.
   On the field, play alternates between poor fundamentals and
prowess.
   A Red Devil baserunner on first broke for second and slid just as
the catcher's throw reached the bag. But the SKA player bobbled the
ball, and it skipped deep into center field, allowing the runner to
take third base.
   The next pitch was wild, and the runner scored.
   A half inning later, SKA tried the same play. The batter missed
the bunt, and the catcher pegged the ball hard to second. Again, the
throw was too hot and low for the fielder, but this time the second
baseman was backing up, and the runner was stranded on second after
the next out.
   So far, there are no stars among the 14 teams in Soviet baseball.
   ``We don't write about individual players, because the level of
play isn't really high enough yet,'' said Semyonov.
   The season started early this year _ in March _ with the
championship slated for late June to give the national team time to
prepare for European competition in Italy in August.
   The team will consist largely of players from SKA and the Red
Devils, said Semyonov, and ``specialists say that if the Soviet team
wins, we could advance'' from Group B to Group A among the European
teams.

   Wu'er Kaixi is haunted by thoughts that he may have
enticed people to their deaths in central Beijing a year ago.
   On the evening of June 3, 1989, as Chinese troops prepared their
bloody assault to clear Tiananmen Square of the pro-democracy
protesters who had occupied it for three weeks, Wu'er appealed to
the people of Beijing for help.
   ``As night fell I thought there weren't enough people on the
square, that it was becoming more and more dangerous,'' he recalled
in an interview exactly one year later.
   Thinking that numbers would protect the students, he rushed about
the capital for more than four hours that night, holding rallies and
urging people to flock to Tiananmen, China's symbolic political
center.
   ``Many people went,'' he said. ``Looking back I feel very _ it's
so difficult to say _ but I believe many people heard me speak, went
to Tiananmen Square and were killed.''
   Hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed when soldiers rammed
their way through Beijing's streets with tanks to recapture
Tiananmen. Wu'er, who collapsed from exhaustion and left the square
in an ambulance shortly before the soldiers arrived, says at least
3,000 died.
   Wu'er was born in Beijing and lived there for 16 years before
attending high school in Xinjiang, the region in China's far west
largely populated by Wu'er's fellow ethnic Uygurs.
   His proper name is Uerkesh Daolet _ Wu'er Kaixi is the Chinese
transliteration of his first name.
   It was during his first year back in Beijing, in a pre-freshman
preparatory course at Beijing Normal University in 1988, that Wu'er
made a name for himself as a cocky but articulate thinker who was
quick to question authority.
   He became head of a Confucian study group that started out as a
forum to discuss his major, education, but quickly developed into an
arena for political debate.
   ``I was outspoken. I was a headache for the administration, a
troublemaker,'' he says.
   He was a troublemaker even to his friends who were trying to slip
him out of the country after June 4.
   ``I didn't want to leave. Friends spent a lot of time not so much
helping me leave China, but convincing me to go,'' he recalls.
   ``So many times I said `So what, if I get caught I get caught.'
Now, however, I understand them,'' said Wu'er, now 22.
   He left China at the end of June, by means he declined to
describe in detail. His name was No. 1 on the government's wanted
list, which ensured media attention overseas, and within a few weeks
he was made vice chairman of the fledgling Federation for a
Democratic China, headquartered in Paris.
   He scoffs at reports that he embezzled money or is a womanizer.
``What bothers me is when the (Communist Party's) People's Daily
says I'm disliked,'' he says. ``I have lots of friends.''
   He travels widely, and has been invited by the Sakharov Committee
in the Soviet Union to attend a human rights seminar in Moscow this
weekend.
   But his top priority remains political reform from within the
Chinese system. ``We have some branch organizations inside China,
even in the army, and the most important thing for us is to send
information to China. Just hold on and wait for an opportunity. That
opportunity will probably be the death of the old man (senior leader
Deng Xiaoping).''
   Wu'er says the death of Deng, 85, could trigger new
demonstrations, but he said change will be slow. ``Fifty or 100
years later, then probably China will become a democratic China.''
   On Monday, the first anniversary of the crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement, Wu'er stood with a group of Chinese
dissidents across from the Chinese Embassy in Paris, chastising
embassy officials for refusing to see them.
   ``All we wanted to do was deliver a letter seeking a dialogue. We
just tried to tell them we still want to go back to China, and that
we're not criminals,'' he said.
   ``But they are afraid of us. They are afraid of popular people's
power. That's the truth.''

   A survivor of the Avianca airline crash was
sentenced to six years to life in prison for having 29 rubber
packets of cocaine in his digestive system, it was announced Monday.
   While hospitalized at the Nassau County Medical Center after the
January crash, defendant Antonio Zuluaga passed the packets, which
tests revealed to containe about 7{ ounces of cocaine.
   Zuluaga suffered a fractured spine, broken ribs and dislocated
hip as a result of the crash.
   After serving his sentence, Antonio Zuluaga, 46, will be deported
to his native Colombia, said Marie Santagata, the Nassau County
Court judge who sentenced him.
   Through an interpreter, Zuluaga recently pleaded guilty to
second-degree possession of a controlled substance. He admitted
buying cocaine in Bogota and carrying it in his stomach while
traveling on the Avianca jet that crashed in Cove Neck, Long Island,
killing 73.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. stuntman was missing Tuesday
after going over Niagara Falls in a kayak, Canadian police said.
   The red kayak was recovered below Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian
side, ``all in one piece ... in fairly good condition, all things
considered,'' said Maureen Quinn, a constable with the Niagara Parks
Police. But she said authorities ``found nothing else, just the
kayak. No body's been found.''
   The Canadian falls, the world's largest by volume, are 181 feet
high, or about as tall as a 13-story building.
   Another constable, Kim Davis, said the 28-year-old man from
Tennessee was trying to complete a stunt that had been planned for
about 10 years. Police said nobody has ever tried to kayak over the
Canadian side of the falls.
   ``Barrels, yes,'' said Quinn of other attempts to go over the
falls in enclosed capsules and live. But, she said, ``it doesn't
seem plausible he could do it (and survive).''
   George Bailey of the Niagara Parks Commission said the man had
attempted the stunt several years ago on the American side of the
falls, but park police stopped him.
   He said the man was accompanied by a film crew and a friend who
took photographs.
   Quinn said police received a call that the stuntman had entered
the water about a half-mile above the falls but ``by the time we
responded it was too late. ... (He) actually went over the brink.''
   She said ``several people saw him go over. It was videotaped.
There were plenty of witnesses.''
   The man, whose identity was not disclosed pending notification of
next of kin, was last seen at about 1:45 p.m. EDT, Quinn said.
   Ken Kitchen was working in an Ontario Hydro tower overlooking the
Niagara River when he saw a man stripped to the waist in a kayak.
   He said the utility closed the dam gates, reducing the water flow
to the falls in an attempt to stop him.
   The man's boat grounded, but he picked it up and moved it into
the middle of the river, Kitchen said.
   ``He was gone before our help could get there. All we could do
was sit and watch helplessly,'' Kitchen said.
   At a press conference later Tuesday, police showed reporters a
videotape a tourist made of the incident.
   The film shows a man in a kayak successfully negotiating the
rapids of the Niagara River just before the falls. Then, he
disappears.
   ``It's beyond me why anyone would attempt this,'' said George
Bailey of the Niagara Parks Commission. ``He obviously doesn't know
our falls.''
   Dave Munday, who went over the falls in a steel barrel three
years ago, said people who try such stunts are usually not aware of
the dangers of the falls.
   ``A lot of people underestimate what's at the bottom,'' he said.
``I did myself. It's just solid rock down there. People don't
realize that.''
   Bailey said 13 people have intentionally gone over the falls _
most in barrel-like structures. Ten of the 13 survived.

   Help Wanted. Baylor College of
Medicine seeks 16 good sleepers to spend a month lying down. Salary
uncertain, but benefits include breakfast in bed _ lunch and dinner,
too.
   It sounds like a couch potato's dream, but there's a catch to the
deal being offered by researchers David Cardus and Wesley McTaggart.
   When they say the sleepers will be confined to bed, they're not
kidding. The people they select won't be allowed to get up for the
the entire month, and they'll spend part of their time spinning
around in a space-age sleep chamber that looks like something
straight out of the movie ``Aliens.''
   The experiments also will require the research subjects to be
hooked up to sensors that monitor a dozen bodily functions.
   Other than that, the job's a snooze.
   Cardus and McTaggart, using a $650,000 grant from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, are involved in a three-year
program to see if the physical strain can be eased on astronauts
making lengthy space voyages.
   The reseach is designed to counteract some of the physiological
effects of weightlessness during space travel _ a pertinent topic in
light of the nation's plans to establish a permanent space station
and to send astronauts to Mars.
   ``What happens if you stay in bed?'' asks Cardus, a physiologist
who has worked with astronauts since the beginning of the nation's
manned space program. ``You get deconditioned. And why don't you get
completely deconditioned? Because you spend two-thirds of the day
carrying your weight around.''
   Once someone gets into space, they don't have any weight to carry
around. Their bodies, especially the cardiovascular systems, get
deconditioned by weightlessness.
   Early astronauts sometimes fainted upon their return to Earth,
and even now, space shuttle crews and cosmonauts on the Soviet space
station must halt their work after a few hours to do exercises to
keep their muscles in shape, he says.
   To simulate weightlessness, Cardus and McTaggart intend to
decondition their subjects by keeping them off their feet for about
two weeks.
   Then, for about another two weeks, the subjects will be put to
bed again _ this time on one of four blow-up mattresses that sit
under plexiglass canopies atop a centrifuge platform.
   From time to time, the entire platform, which fills a
30-by-30-foot room, will turn, spinning the four subjects about 20
times a minute to simulate one `G' _ or about the force of Earth
gravity. The speed produces a force that travels from the head to
the feet in a horizontal position.
   Scientists believe a regular schedule of exposure to one-G or
more will have the same effect as frequent exercise. And they're
hopeful that if it works, a similar machine could be included on the
space station or the ship that heads for Mars. They also want to
find out if the reconditioning works while the subject is either
asleep or awake or both.
   ``We think the apparatus will meet its purposes, but of course
you don't know the problems until you start to use it,'' Cardus said.
   Baylor has been advertising for men between ages 20 and 40 who
have at least a month to spend laying around.
   They've received replies from all over the world. But a limited
budget, and the need to retest the subjects periodically after the
experiment, has them looking primarily in the Houston area.
   So far, they've interviewed about 10 candidates. They'd like to
get 16 subjects _ four groups of four men.
   After the initial 16, Cardus says he may try to recruit women.
   ``The physiology of the male and female is a little different.
This individual will be studied in considerable depth and we don't
want to complicate the experimental design,'' he says. ``But the
principal reason is this: Our work is complex enough.''

   Eight men who fled Cuba in three separate groups on
inner tubes, a small boat and a makeshift raft were plucked from the
Atlantic Ocean Monday in good condition, the Coast Guard said.
   All of them were turned over to the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, raising to 179 the total number of Cubans
completing the dangerous passage across the Florida Straits this
year.
   The first two men were picked up by a Coast Guard patrol boat
from Miami Beach after the cruise ship Scandinavian Saga spotted
them drifting on inner tubes about 10 miles northeast of Miami at
10:10 a.m., Petty Officer Steve Sapp said.
   Also, three Cubans who said they left the island 12 days ago were
spotted in a small skiff by the freighter Humacao just off Cay Sal
Island, about 130 miles south of Miami and 35 miles north of Bahia
de Santa Clara, Cuba.
   The Coast Guard cutter Metompkin arrived at the scene at about
10:30 a.m. and took the men to Key West.
   Three more Cubans were found in a 10-foot raft about seven miles
east of John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park off Key Largo at about
1 p.m., Sapp said.
   They told officers who picked them up in a patrol boat from Coast
Guard station Islamorada that they left Cuba four days earlier and
had an engine that propelled their raft for 18 hours.

   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo said
Monday that he and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev have agreed
to end 45 years of Cold War animosity by establishing diplomatic
relations between their countries.
   ``As a result of my meeting with President Gorbachev today,
normal bilateral relations between our countries will be restored,''
Roh said.
   The South Korean leader said discussions would continue toward
that end, but that no dates had been set.
   The Gorbachev-Roh meeting, which took place at the end of
Gorbachev's visit to the United States, was the first between
leaders of the two nations since Korea was partitioned more than
four decades ago.
   The Cold War ice on the Korean peninsula ``now has begun to
crack,'' Roh told reporters.
   Though nothing was put in writing, he said the two countries plan
to boost economic and trade ties.
   The Soviet president was more vague in his summation of the
meeting.
   ``We will let the fruit grow ripe, and when the fruit grows ripe,
we will eat it,'' Gorbachev told reporters outside the Soviet consul
general's home, before departing San Francisco for home at the end
of a five-day U.S. visit.
   Korean officials have called friendlier ties with the Soviet
Union a cornerstone of the Roh administration.
   The two countries have had an unstable relationship since the
formation of South Korea at the end of World War II, but the
hostility began to abate in 1988 when the Soviets announced they
would participate in the Seoul Olympics.
   Roh plans to meet with President Bush in Washington on Wednesday
to brief him on his talk with Gorbachev and to discuss the
U.S.-Soviet summit, which ended Sunday.
   North Korea became a Communist satellite state in 1948. In 1950,
Soviet leader Josef Stalin promised to support North Korea's
invasion of the south, an attack that led to three years of war that
ended with an armistice but no peace treaty.
   It is estimated that the Soviet Union now supplies 70 percent of
North Korea's military supplies, including advanced weapons systems.
   An improved relationship between the Soviet Union and South Korea
could benefit the United States, by making possible an accelerated
withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea. The United States
already has announced plans to withdraw 7,000 of its 43,000 troops
during the next two years.
   Roh met Sunday with top U.S. State Department officials,
including Richard Solomon, the assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific affairs, who briefed him on the Gorbachev-Bush
summit.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and former President Reagan
also visited Roh on Sunday, the day he arrived in San Francisco.

<HEAD>Termites Unlock Coal Murder Mystery for History Buffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELCH, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Termites discovered in a courthouse basement
unlocked a mystery bugging local history buffs for nearly 70 years.
   An exterminator told McDowell County officials a padlocked room
in the basement of their courthouse could be harboring termites, and
when they opened the door last week they found more than just the
pesky insects.
   County officials found about 3,000 documents dating to the 1870s,
including a file chronicling a notorious murder trial over the
shooting of a coal union organizer in 1921 that was part of the
movie ``Matewan.''
   Circuit Clerk Paul Lambert said the trial of C.E. Lively, Buster
Pence and William Salter in the death of Ed Chambers was an
important county event. The men were found innocent by a jury
comprised of company sympathizers, he said.
   History buffs had spent years searching for the records, Lambert
said.
   ``Out of all the records, I pulled one suspicious-looking one
because it was thicker,'' he said. ``And lo and behold, it was the
Lively murder trial.''
   The Aug. 21, 1921, shooting was part of bloody struggles between
union workers and coal companies, Lambert said.
   Bullet holes from the shootout on the courthouse lawn that left
Chambers dead are still visible on the courthouse, he said.
   As for the termites, Lambert said the bug problem seems to be
solved.

   Declaring that ``the Cold War is now behind
us,'' Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Monday called for a
more united world in which American and Soviet scientists work
together to destroy nuclear weapons.
   Before leaving for Moscow about 7:45 p.m. PDT Monday night, the
Soviet leader met with South Korean President Roh Tae-woo, and Roh
said afterward the two countries agreed to establish diplomatic
relations.
   The 45-year-old Cold War ice on their relationship ``now has
begun to crack,'' Roh said.
   He said discussions toward a resumption of ties would continue,
but no date was set. Gorbachev, speaking briefly with reporters,
summarized the meeting by saying, ``We will let the fruit grow ripe,
and when the fruit grows ripe, we will eat it.''
   It was the first meeting between leaders of the two countries,
which have never established diplomatic relations since Korea was
divided between victorious U.S. and Soviet forces who liberated the
peninsula from Japanese rule at the end of World War II.
   In the last hours of his visit to the United States, Gorbachev
also continued his courtship of business, telling top West Coast
executives he would speed up plans to make the Soviet ruble a
convertible currency, helping foreign companies take their profits
out of his country.
   Gorbachev said Moscow wants to overcome the reluctance of Western
executives who hold back from investing in the Soviet Union because
they don't have enough control of their assets.
   In an afternoon speech at Stanford University, Gorbachev said the
Soviet Union and United States should be partners in building the
future, though he acknowledged that while the two societies are
coming closer, ``they probably will never be fully alike. There is
no need for that.''
   He implored scientists in both countries to join in determining
how nuclear weapons could be destroyed without harming people or the
environment.
   He also advocated a system of international alliances that unites
rather than divides the world.
   ``The Cold War is now behind us. Let us not wrangle over who won
it,'' the Soviet leader told the cheering audience.
   Gorbachev called for a ``new approach to the structures of
security ... and alliance building'' that would result in a ``unity
... worthy of the life of a human being.''
   Earlier in the day, Gorbachev paused for a sentimental reunion
with former President Reagan, who met him five times in four years
to help thaw the icy relations between the Cold War adversaries.
   Reagan said afterward that Gorbachev ``wants the same kind of
solution we all want'' to the Soviet Union's problems, now
complicated by economic crisis, secessionist drives by the Baltic
republics, ethnic strife and growing political instability in the
Russian heartland.
   ``He knows we both are together in trying to increase the
closeness of our two countries,'' the 79-year-old Reagan told
reporters.
   Mrs. Reagan, whose stiff and sometimes frosty meetings with Mrs.
Gorbachev were a recurrent subplot at the superpower summits, said
after a private coffee with the Soviet first lady there has been ``a
great misunderstanding about our relationship.''
   ``It was a very different time,'' Mrs. Reagan said. ``We were
plowing new ground.''
   Gorbachev's message to American business, first expressed in a
speech Sunday in Minneapolis, was a Soviet version of the U.S.
politician's warning that the train is leaving the station and those
who don't climb aboard now are going to miss it.
   ``We are now watching those who maybe are risking something,'' he
reiterated Monday afternoon. ``And we are watching those who stand
on the sidelines.''
   On Sunday, in Minneapolis, he told a gathering of corporate
luminaries, ``Those who are with us at this time have a good
prospect of cooperation in our great country, in our great market
because of its tremendous potential. But those who just stand on the
sidelines, who do not want to risk, who want to wait and see, who
don't want to risk their dollars, well, they will remain, I think
observers, for years to come. We'll make sure that that is so.''
   The Soviet president suggested to the California business leaders
that the U.S. air and space industry could benefit from increased
cooperation, specifically mentioning the Soviets' Energiya rockets,
capable of lifting twice the payload of U.S. rockets. They could be
used to put large satellites or pieces of a U.S. space station into
orbit.
   He also said the vast and largely untapped natural resources of
the Soviet Far East are open to development with the aid of foreign
investors, and welcomed a proposal that a private U.S.-Soviet
commission be established to help plan for the future.
   The Gorbachev-Roh session was boosted as a major event by the
South Koreans, who are eager to establish ties with former
Communist-bloc countries now seen as a promising new market for
South Korean exports. But the Soviet side, still sensitive to the
effect on its longtime Communist client in North Korea, played down
talk of a get-together, refusing for days even to confirm a meeting
would take place.
   South Korea's incredible economic success story has been watched
with envy by Soviet planners who, if they can't emulate the Asian
nation's rapid growth, would at least like to expand trade ties in
hopes of acquiring sorely needed technology and consumer goods at
relatively low cost.

   The Center for International Security and
Arms Control at Stanford University is looking forward to more
frequent exchanges with the Soviet Union following praise from
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   In a speech Monday at Stanford, the Soviet president noted the
contributions toward world peace made by the center and by
university scientists.
   ``It was a very nice surprise. We certainly didn't program that,
I can tell you,'' center spokeswoman Rosemary Hamerton-Kelly said.
``His whole speech means it will be easier for Stanford to pursue
any type of cooperation with the Soviet Union.''
   It was the first formal recognition of the center by the Soviet
leader, said Hamerton-Kelly, assistant to the institute's director.
   The center has made frequent exchanges with Soviet academics,
however, and last year was visited by Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, a
chief Soviet adviser on arms control, she said.
   The center, established in its present form in 1983 and operated
under the political science department, evolved out of an arms
control program developed at Stanford in 1970, Hamerton-Kelly said.
   ``We do research and teach in the field of U.S.-Soviet relations
_ international security more broadly _ and we have a practical
emphasis on the Asian-Pacific region,'' she said.
   The institute has in the past studied former President Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative and, as the thaw in the Cold War
continues, is planning to study the transition from a
defense-oriented to a civilian-oriented economy, Hamerton-Kelly said.
   ``One part of it is the economic effects it has on the local
economy, but there's another whole aspect,'' she said. ``If you are
going to cut back your military resources, how do you structure the
forces and also the industry in such a way that would there suddenly
be a threat that you could gear it up again?''

<HEAD>Religious Conservatives Laud School Worship Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservatives and religious fundamentalists are
hailing a Supreme Court ruling they say helps put extracurricular
prayer back in public schools for students who want to worship
together.
   The decision ``should send a message to school administrators
nationally that religious speech on the high school campus is as
fully protected as any other student speech,'' said Jay Sekulow, an
Atlanta lawyer for Christian Advocates Serving Evangelism.
   In an 8-1 ruling Monday, the justices said public high schools
generally must allow student prayer groups to meet and worship if
other student clubs are permitted at school.
   Such extracurricular prayer meetings do not violate the
constitutionally required church-state separation when high school
religious groups are given the same access accorded such activities
as chess or scuba diving clubs, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said for
the court. Justice John Paul Stevens dissented.
   The decision upholds the Equal Access Act of 1984, in which
Congress said public high schools accepting federal aid must not
discriminate against groups based on ``the religious, political,
philosophical or other content of the speech at such meetings.''
   Liberals said the ruling was a pretext for reconsidering
classroom prayer and could undermine earlier rulings that banned
such activity.
   In other actions Monday, the court:
   _Ruled 8-1 in a case from Illinois that police undercover agents
may seek to elicit confessions from jailed suspects without first
warning them of their right to remain silent or to a lawyer's help.
   _Ruled unanimously in a North Carolina case that nuclear industry
``whistleblowers'' who say they were disciplined for complaining
about lax safety may sue their employers under state personal-injury
laws.
   _Agreed to study the government's power to lift price controls on
some natural gas, a case that has tens of millions of consumer
dollars at stake.
   _Said it will decide whether passengers on international flights
may sue airlines for the emotional distress they allegedly suffer in
near-crashes that cause them no physical harm.
   The student prayer case stemmed from the refusal of Omaha, Neb.,
school officials to approve a Christian Bible-reading club at
Westside High School in 1985.
   Bridget Mergens Mayhew, the former Westside High student whose
attempt to start the club led to the ruling, said she was delighted.
``It's got to be clear to all school officials that they can't
discriminate against religion any more,'' she said.
   Mrs. Mayhew, now 23, said group Bible study can be a source of
strength when ``you're a kid and you've got all these things coming
at you ... drugs, or whatever.''
   Beverly LaHaye, president of Concerned Women for America, a
conservative activist group, also applauded the high court. ``The
Supreme Court has ruled against religious apartheid in American high
schools,'' she said. ``To exclude student religious groups from
meeting on campus is nothing more than bigoted discrimination.''
   But atheist activist Madalyn Murray O'Hair of Austin, Texas,
called the ruling tragic. ``This a major intrusion of religion into
our secular public schools,'' she said.
   In 1962, Mrs. O'Hair filed the lawsuit that led to a Supreme
Court ban of school-sponsored prayers. The court has since also
banned schools from conducting daily Bible readings and from posting
the Ten Commandments on classroom walls.
   John Buchanan of the liberal People for the American Way said,
``The court has opened wide the schoolhouse door to religious study
and worship, leaving impressionable children to assume that such
clubs are part and parcel of the school-approved daily
instructions.''
   The National School Boards Association had called the 1984 law a
thinly disguised move to return prayer to the public schools.
   The administration defended the law as a legitimate attempt to
protect religious liberty for students.
   In her opinion for the court, O'Connor rejected arguments that
permitting Bible-study groups will mislead students into believing
the school endorses religion.
   ``A school that permits a student-initiated and student-led
religious club to meet after school, just as it permits any other
student group to do, does not convey a message of state approval or
endorsement of the particular religion,'' she said.

   The Presbyterian Church, faced with
potentially bitter battles over abortion and the ordination of
homosexuals, decided Monday to wait until next year to tackle the
issues.
   Commissioners to the 202nd General Assembly of the Presbyterian
Church (U.S.A) voted overwhelmingly Monday to postpone until 1991
action on resolutions dealing with a variety of such issues. They
ranged from a call for the church to withdraw from an abortion
rights group to a proposal to allow local church bodies to ordain
homosexuals.
   ``I feel that debate on this matter results in high feelings,
emotion, divisiveness,'' said the Rev. Rush Otey of the Greater
Atlanta Presbytery. ``There's a time for the church to speak.
There's a time for the church to be silent.''
   But representatives of an anti-abortion group charged the
denomination lacked the ``moral courage'' to address the issues.
   ``There is a desire to see the issue in a political sense but a
reluctance to deal with it as a moral issue,'' said Terry
Schlossberg, executive director of Presbyterians Pro-Life.
   The assembly voted late Monday to take away semiofficial status
from 21 private church organizations, including some of its severest
liberal and conservative critics.
   Despite criticism that they were tring to reduce voices of
dissent within the church, nearly 80 percent of the commisioners
voted to delete a portion of the church's Book of Order that gives
groups such as Presbyterians for Lesbian-Gay Concerns and
Presbyterians Pro-Life the right to be officially represented at the
General Assembly and church meetings.
   The proposal goes to the church's 177 presbyteries. A majority of
the regional bodies must approve the change for it to take effect.
   A task force on sexuality is expected to report on both
homosexuality and abortion to the 1991 General Assembly. The church
supports legalized abortion, and opposes the ordination of
homosexuals.
   In other business Monday, the assembly voted to create a church
office for the environment and to call for stricter gun control laws.
   Two of the resolutions which were deferred called for church
agencies to withdraw from the Religious Coalition on Abortion Rights
and to oppose late-term abortions where the fetus could survive
outside the womb.
   The church, embroiled in a dispute over the distribution of
sexually explicit literature to a youth meeting by a
church-recognized gay caucus, also postponed until 1991 a decision
on whether to allow local church bodies to ordain homsexuals.
   The issue of homosexuality heated up in the 2.9 million-member
denomination last summer when Presbyterians Lesbian-Gay Concerns
distributed brochures detailing the sexual practices of homosexuals
to high school and college students attending a church meeting at
Purdue University. The brochures discussed both oral and anal sex,
and gave explicit instructions in the use of condoms.
   In the resulting uproar, several regional church groups
petitioned the general assemby to deny any official church status to
the homosexual caucus. A vote on the overtures has yet to be
scheduled.
   James D. Anderson, communications secretary for the homosexual
group, said the reaction ``is an expression of the deep-seated
homophobia in the church.''
   But he said the calls for condemnation will help his group in the
long run by raising the issue before the church.
   ``The church has to express its hate, its anger, its fear, its
revulsion,'' he said. ``That's the only way to cure it.''
   In approving a 93-page document entitled ``Restoring Creation for
Ecology and Justice,'' commissioners voted to establish a
denominational office on environmental justice, and incorporate
environmental concerns into worship and preaching, education
programs and community ministries.
   Church members were asked to be particularly involved in waste
management, recycling and energy conservation programs and land-use
planning.
   The resolution on gun violence called for more effective federal
laws regulating the manufacture and sale of guns, including
requiring the registration and licensing of gun buyers and owners
and background checks before guns are sold.

   As the Gorbachev motorcade rolled by,
demonstrators chanted, ``Out of the Baltic states!'' But a far
larger crowd intent on seeing the Soviet leader countered, ``Out of
the way! Out of the way!''
   ``People have been so much taken by their Gorbymania that I don't
think many are hearing us,'' despaired Lithuanian-born Algis
Zemaitaitis, taking part in the protest at Stanford University.
``The people have been taken by the charm of Gorby.''
   Indeed, demonstrators were no match for Gorbymania during
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit Monday. A beaming Gorbachev
captivated thousands at the university, wading into the crowds as
usual to shake hands and exchange hugs and a few words.
   Pro-Gorbachev T-shirts, banners, signs and cheers of ``Go
Gorby!'' were seen and heard. Scalpers sold ``free'' tickets to a
Gorbachev speech for a reported $1,800. The 1,700 tickets had been
distributed by lottery.
   ``I've been in crowds that went to see Nixon and Kennedy and I've
never seen anything like this,'' said John Brigham, a political
science professor at the University of Massachusetts who was
visiting the San Francisco Bay area. ``This is more like celebrity
government. You can feel people are pulled toward Gorbachev in some
way.''
   Hundreds waving flags and signs staged demonstrations demanding
independence for the Baltic states or raising ethnic grievances and
complaints of human-rights abuses. But the protesters weren't sure
they were getting through.
   ``The American public is so in love with Gorby they are not
paying attention,'' said Vazken Mousesian, 58, who is of Armenian
descent.
   Before entering an auditorium to deliver a speech, Gorbachev
worked the crowd behind police lines.
   ``He was definitely just a real person. ... He was leading the
pack, hoping his bodyguards could keep up,'' said Alex Levy, a
21-year-old political science major.
   Before the Soviet leader arrived, capitalism flourished on
campus. Jeff Vierling, 19, and Marlowe Johnson, 21, sat on a curb
asking for serious offers of $1,000 or more in cash for each of
their two tickets to Gorbachev's speech.
   The tickets are ``worth a great deal to me, but the only value
here is sentimental. I can probably see him better on TV,'' said
Johnson, an international relations major who wants to take a trip
to Europe.
   Earlier Monday, pro-Lithuanian groups held a protest at the
Golden Gate Bridge, then moved to the San Francisco home of the
Soviet consul general, where Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev had
breakfast with former President Reagan and his wife, Nancy.
   About 100 Cambodian exiles also staked out the consul general's
house, demanding an end to Soviet aid to Cambodia's pro-Vietnamese
Communist government.
   The Lithuanian independence group hoisted an oversized Lithuanian
flag and a banner that read, ``To Hell with Gorbachev: Butcher of
Afghanistan.''
   Protesters said President Bush's support for possible
most-favored-nation trading status for the Soviet Union suggested
lack of interest in the Baltic issue.
   ``We have to be tough. We got to this point being tough. Of
course, even Reagan isn't tough any more,'' said protester West
Stewart.

<HEAD>U.S. May Help Soviets Destroy Chemical Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a sign of the Cold War's thaw, officials say
the United States may lend the Soviet Union a technological hand to
destroy thousands of tons of chemical weapons.
   As recently as three years ago the Soviets had not acknowledged
having any such weapons.
   An agreement signed by President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev last Friday requires both sides to begin
destroying their arsenals of deadly gases by 1992. Questions remain,
though, about how the Soviets will carry it out.
   The Kremlin decided last summer to bow to pressure from domestic
environmentalists and close a new plant built to destroy chemical
weapons by incineration. The Soviets have disclosed no plans for
building another plant and it remains unclear how they will meet the
1992 date set in the new agreement.
   Barry Daniel, chief spokesman for the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, which oversaw negotiation of the agreement, said
Monday he could not rule out the possibility that the United States
might agree to destroy the Soviets' chemicals for them.
   He said this carried large legal risks, however, and it appeared
more likely that the United States might offer to help build or
operate a plant on Soviet soil.
   The Bush-Gorbachev agreement requires the two sides to cooperate
in developing safe and environmentally sound methods of destroying
their chemical stockpiles. Both sides are to have no more than 5,000
tons of weapons by the year 2002, compared with 25,000 tons now held
by the United States and 50,000 tons by the Soviets.
   The United States plans to begin destroying some of its older
chemical weapons on Johnston Atoll in the Pacific late this year,
well ahead of the schedule set in the chemical agreement, Daniel
said.
   The Johnston Atoll plant was built to meet a congressional
requirement set in 1985 to destroy all existing U.S. chemical
weapons by 1997 as a condition for approving a Pentagon program to
produce a new generation of chemical arms.
   Plans call for building other destruction plants at existing
chemical arms stockpile sites in Oregon, Utah, Colorado, Arkansas,
Alabama, Kentucky, Indiana and Maryland.
   Elisa Harris, a chemical weapons expert at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank, said U.S.-Soviet collaboration
on technical aspects of chemical arms destruction would help Moscow
overcome domestic environmental critics.
   ``They would like to have the American stamp of approval on their
technology'' to persuade the critics that destruction can be
accomplished safely, she said.
   In recognition of the technical and environmental obstacles
facing both the United States and the Soviet Union, the new
agreement gives each side until 1999 to destroy 50 percent of the
chemicals covered by the accord. The remaining amounts would be
destroyed in the final three years of the agreement.
   The Soviet procedure for destroying chemical weapons is to
decompose the active nerve agent by mixing it with alcohol, making
it non-toxic. It then is burned. The U.S. method skips the
decomposition step and burns the chemicals in an incinerator that
heats the agents to 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit.
   The chemicals, mainly nerve agents and mustard gases, are used in
a variety of artillery projectiles, mortar cartridges, land mines,
rockets and gravity bombs.
   The use of chemical weapons is outlawed by the 1925 Geneva
Protocol, signed by 149 nations, but there are no international
limits on possession or production.

   Here are excerpts from Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's address at Stanford University on Monday:
   
   Ladies and gentlemen, I'm very pleased that within the framework
of my state visit to the United States I am here among you within
the walls of the world-famous university. Thank you for your warm
hospitality.
   I think that those who work or study in your university are
doubly lucky it is in California and California is a special place,
even by international standards.
   And I'm saying this not just by way of a compliment and to say
pleasant things to the governor of this state, who is here with his
wife. I think I am just stating a fact. It is said that only five
countries in the world produce a greater gross output than your
state. The ideas and technologies of tomorrow are born here in
California. California is closely linked economically with Europe,
Asia and Latin America.
   So this is a good place to live and for me an appropriate place
for discussing how the Soviet Union and the United States have
positioned themselves on the dividing line between the centuries and
the eras on the coasts of the Pacific ... described as the
Mediterranean of the future. It is appropriate now to ponder the
destinies of the world since it was here in San Francisco the United
Nations was founded precisely 45 years ago.
   I think this is symbolic, that it is this sunny city that was
selected as the place where to ... proclaim the foundation, the
establishment of this organization whose efficiency we all need very
much.
   Let us look at the conclusions drawn that time, right after the
horrible war. The United Nations was set up to include ... and to
remove the political, economic and social causes of war, ...
conforming it with the principles of justice and international law.
   The United Nations was set up to include ... security ... and to
remove the political, economic and social causes of war ... to
promote relations among nations ... on the equal rights and
self-determination of peoples, with respect for human rights. ...
   It is only now that international politics is really starting to
adjust itself to these ideologies and principles, and all of us felt
how much we need the United Nations if we really are to move the
world, a new world, a new kind of relationships in the world in the
interest of all countries and nations. For a long time the Pacific
was a center of confrontations and the arms race. ... Nations found
themselves on the opposite sides of the barricades of ancient
revolutions. But new winds are now blowing ... the Japanese and
Koreans and Chinese and other Asian peoples have lessons for the
entire world to learn. ...
   Let us think about the future, both of us have more than enough
reasons. ... I am under no illusions regarding the possibility of
faster convergence (of) societies, and they are quite different. For
many years they were developing in different directions. They
probably will never be fully alike. There is no need for that. ...
   The cold war is now behind us. Let us not wrangle over who won
it, who won the Cold War.
   There was a time when military procurement orders were
considered, are still considered by some, to be the best incentive
for economic and technological progress. ... (In the 1970s) Santa
Clara County, which was the first in per-capita military contracts,
began to explore ways of demilitarizing the local economy. I hope
that as Soviet-American relations improve ... participation in the
arms race will become a thing of the past ... not only for your
beautiful state but both our great powers.
   Science has played a major role in the arms race. Science was the
first to seek out ... and to look for a way out. ... Here we have to
give credit to the joint efforts of Soviet and American scientists
to which Stanford University scientists have made a very substantial
contribution in their program for the development of the basic
principles for such concepts as international security and strategic
stability.

<HEAD>Survey: Americans Cutting Down on Fats, But Overweight Persists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are cutting down on fatty and
high-cholesterol foods, but 61 percent still are overweight,
according to a national survey.
   ``There is no evidence that Americans are winning the `battle of
the bulge,'' says a report by Prevention magazine based on an annual
poll conducted by Louis Harris and Associates.
   The proportion of adults who are overweight has remained close to
60 percent since 1983, when the magazine began commissioning the
polls.
   Levels of regular strenuous exercise have also remained about the
same over the past seven years. About 35 percent in the latest
survey said they work up a sweat for at least 20 minutes, at least
three times a week.
   The survey of 1,250 adults was conducted by telephone Nov. 6
through Dec. 13 last year. No margin of error was given.
   Among the bright spots in Prevention's report card were continued
reductions in the number of people eating foods high in fat and
cholesterol.
   Half of those polled said they ``try a lot'' to avoid eating
high-cholesterol foods like eggs, dairy products and fatty meats _
up from 42 percent in 1983.
   And 58 percent said they avoid eating too much fat, up from 55
percent in 1983 and 54 percent in 1988.
   ``The evidence is overwhelming that a diet high in fat ... is a
major threat to health and longevity, and it appears that the public
is getting that message,'' the magazine's report said.
   But the survey also found a decline in efforts to get enough
vitamins and minerals, down five percentage points from 1983 to 58
percent, and to avoid sugary foods, also down five points from the
first survey to 46 percent.
   Among those who are overweight, more than half are at least 10
percent over the recommended weight range for their height and
build. A quarter were within their recommended range, and 15 percent
were underweight.
   About 35 percent said they exercise strenuously at least three
times a week. By sex, that was 42 percent of the men and 29 percent
of the women.
   The survey found that men were more likely to exercise
strenuously and frequently, while women were found to be more
nutrition-conscious.
   The survey also found:
   _46 percent of respondents said they avoided sugar, compared with
51 percent in 1983.
   _Eating fish twice a week followed the same trend, down from 34
percent in 1985, the first year the question was asked, to 28
percent in the latest poll.
   _53 percent said they have their cholesterol level checked at
least once a year.
   _44 percent of women said they examine their breasts to check for
possible cancer at least once a month _ down from 51 percent in 1988
but up from 37 percent in the first survey.
   _75 percent have a dental exam at least once a year.
   _28 percent said they smoked cigarettes, down from 30 percent in
1983.
   _Questions about alcohol and drug use found 91 percent drink
moderately or not at all and 94 percent ``never use recreational
drugs, such as marijuana, speed and downers.''

<HEAD>U.S. Dialogue with PLO Said in Jeopardy</HEAD>

   New U.S. contacts with the Palestine Liberation
Organization following last week's abortive guerrilla attack along
the Israeli coast reinforced the view of some officials that the
U.S.-PLO dialogue may have to be suspended.
   The dialogue ``clearly is in jeopardy,'' a senior administration
official said Monday, echoing the view of many in the State
Department about the potential consequences of the raid last week by
a radical PLO faction.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the U.S.
ambassador to Tunisia, Robert Pelletreau, has met three times in
Tunis with PLO representatives since the raid took place.
   The United States is demanding that the PLO dissociate itself
from the attack and condemn it as well. It also is asking the PLO to
expel the faction responsible for the raid, the Palestine Liberation
Front.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said last Friday the
administration was dissatisfied with the responses it has received
thus far from PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   The officials said little has changed since Baker made that
statement but the administration is still withholding a final
decision on whether the dialogue should be allowed to continue.
   Meantime, Palestinian sources in Baghdad, Iraq, said Arafat has
summoned the PLO's ruling body to discuss the status of the U.S.-PLO
dialogue.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said PLF leader
Mohammed Abbas will attend the meeting of the 15-member Executive
Committee. They said Arafat also has summoned to Baghdad the
secretary-generals of all factions within the PLO.
   The Reagan administration agreed to open a dialogue with the PLO
in December 1988 after Arafat renounced terrorism. The
administration had said in March the PLO was abiding by that
commitment but the events of last Wednesday _ when two boatloads of
PLF guerrillas were intercepted near Tel Aviv _ has produced a
policy review in Washington.
   PLF members hijacked the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro in
October 1985. That incident led to the death of Leon Klinghoffer, an
American whose two daughters planned to appeal in Washington today
for a suspension of the dialogue with the PLO.
   Arafat seems eager to find a formula that would preserve the
PLO-U.S. link without alienating hard-line grassroots sentiment
within PLO ranks.
   Meanwhile, Arab countries at the United Nations are seeking ways
to underscore the international isolation of the United States on
the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   The United States last week vetoed a U.N. Security Council
proposal for a fact-finding mission to be sent to the West Bank and
Gaza Strip to inspect living conditions of Palestinians.
   The U.S. officials, insisting on anonymity, said several similar
proposals may be introduced that probably will leave the
administration in the uncomfortable position of having to register
additional vetoes.
   The Arab countries also are contemplating the possibility of
convening a U.N. General Assembly session in Geneva to discuss the
situation in the occupied territories. If such a meeting is held,
the U.S. officials said it probably would produce a resolution
critical of Israel that would be approved by a lopsided margin.
   By holding the session in Geneva, Arafat could address the
gathering. If such a meeting were held in New York, the
administration could prevent an Arafat appearance by denying him a
visa.

<HEAD>Diplomatic Scramble Tries To Save Cambodian Peace Talks</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with diplomatic activity trying to save
cease-fire. No pickup.

   Chinese, Thai and American officials joined attempts
Tuesday to foster progress in peace talks that were stalled on the
brink of signing a cease-fire in Cambodia's 11-year civil war,
Japanese officials said.
   Thai and Cambodian officials said a meeting would be held later
in the day, but it was still not clear whether all four contending
parties would be present or whether a cease-fire would emerge.
   The first session of the talks broke off Monday after just 25
minutes because the Khmer Rouge, the strongest guerrilla group
opposing the Hanoi-backed government in Phnom Penh, refused to
attend without the right to raise issues and sign the truce pact as
an equal partner.
   A flurry of diplomatic activity focused on the 16th floor of the
Imperial Hotel where Prince Norodom Sihanouk and other members of
his three-party guerrilla coalition _ including the Khmer Rouge _
were staying in rooms along one corridor.
   Chinese Ambassador Yang Zhenya was seen leaving the corridor. A
Japanese Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a U.S. diplomat had visited the guerrilla
delegations earlier Tuesday. The American's identity was not
immediately known.
   Thailand's deputy prime minister, Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, a
key drafter of the proposed cease-fire, left the corridor with two
high-ranking Japanese Foreign Ministry officials.
   It appeared progress was in the air, as Chavalit replied
positively when asked if the Cambodians had accepted a proposal. But
he left without giving further details.
   The peace conference, the first in Japan since World War II,
appeared to have collapsed Monday when the Khmer Rouge nominal
leader, Khieu Samphan, boycotted the opening session.
   But informal meetings continued, mostly in the hotel where the
guerrilla delegations were staying. Pressure came from other
countries including China, which backs the Khmer Rouge, the United
States, which backs Sihanouk while trying to distance itself from
the Khmer Rouge's harsh and even genocidal reputation, and Thailand,
through which arms flow to the rebels.
   All four of Cambodia's warring factions had tentatively agreed to
a cease-fire before coming to Tokyo, but the hard-line communist
Khmer Rouge refused to participate in two-sided peace talks between
the loose guerrilla coalition and the government of Premier Hun Sen.
   Hun Sen has refused to negotiate equally with the Khmer Rouge or
allow them an equal role in a future interim government, saying that
might allow them to return to power.
   Hundreds of thousands of Cambodians died during the group's
1975-79 brutal rule before Vietnam invaded in late 1978 and
installed the moderate communist Hun Sen government.
   Vietnam says it withdrew all its troops in September, but there
are charges that some remain in Cambodia.
   If a truce were signed, it would be the first time the sides
actually had signed a cease-fire. But the draft agreement lacks any
mechanism to police a truce. Even if a cease-fire is worked out, the
sides disagree on measures to administer the country before
elections can be held.
   Sihanouk, who once was king of Cambodia, has led the
three-faction guerrilla coalition since 1982. He believes the
faction must be included in any political arrangement for the
country, saying its disciplined and powerful army would be the best
guarantee against a return of the Vietnamese.
   In Bangkok, Sihanouk spokesman Roland Eng said heavy fighting was
continuing and guerrilla groups had launched offensives in areas
around Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital.
   ``We are still carrying on normally on the battlefield. Nobody
knows what will happen in Tokyo, so for the time being we will
continue as normally on the battlefield,'' he said Monday.

<HEAD>Consumer Groups Say Credit Life Insurance Expensive, Unnecessary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two consumer groups are urging states to
tighten controls on credit life insurance policies they say are far
too expensive and unnecessary for most customers.
   ``This is pervasive throughout all segments of the installment
loan market,'' said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the
Consumer Federation of America. ``Credit life insurance is the
nation's worst insurance ripoff.''
   Credit life insurance is sold by banks, finance companies, auto
dealers and other lenders to consumers taking out installment loans.
The policies pay off the loan if the borrower dies.
   CFA and the National Insurance Consumer Organization released a
report Monday calling on state insurance departments to require
lenders to return to consumers at least 70 cents in benefits for
each dollar paid in premiums.
   ``This would force a drastic reduction in price in almost all
states,'' the report said. It said the 1988 benefits payout amounted
to 43 cents on the dollar. The rest went for profits and
administrative costs.
   The two groups also exhorted state insurance departments to
launch massive education campaigns to let consumers know they don't
have to buy the insurance when they buy a car, sign up for a credit
card or take out a loan.
   ``In most cases, people need life insurance to protect against
the economic consequences of early death,'' said Bob Hunter,
president of NICO. He said a comprehensive life insurance policy
should be extensive enough to cover unpaid loans.
   ``You shouldn't buy life insurance to cover your credit''
separately, Hunter said. It costs more and does not allow a spouse
or other survivor to continue making monthly payments; the separate
policy would pay off the loan immediately.
   Virginia Stafford, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers
Association, whose members sell many credit life insurance policies,
said many people do not have comprehensive life insurance policies.
   ``For those customers, credit life insurance may represent a good
deal,'' she said.
   Stafford said her group does not believe consumers are being
overcharged. But she agreed they should be better educated about
their choices.
   According to the two consumer groups, more than 70 million credit
life insurance policies were in force in 1988. Consumers paid $2.1
billion in premiums and received $900 million in benefits that year.
   Some policy holders are unaware they have bought credit life
insurance, others are led to believe they need it to obtain a loan
and others fall victim to emotional pitches to protect their loved
ones when they die, the report said.
   Lenders also make it difficult to refuse the insurance by
building it into the monthly payment, the report said, necessitating
a rewrite of the loan papers if the policy is refused. Customers
also are no able to find out if the price is fair, the report added.
   According to the report, all states regulate credit life
insurance but only four _ Maine, New York, Vermont and New Jersey _
require payouts at or above the 60 percent recommended by the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
   The groups said the severity of overcharges varies from state to
state, with the worst in the Southeast and the best prices in the
Northeast.
   CFA is a federation of 240 consumer groups with 50 million
members and calls itself the nation's largest consumer advocacy
group. NICO says it is the only national consumer group devoted to
insurance advocacy and education.

   When is a U.S.-Soviet treaty not a treaty? When
it's an agreement, a convention, a protocol, a contract, a joint
statement or a memorandum of understanding.
   Does it make any difference? It does to members of Congress,
thousands of other officials and hundreds of millions of people
worldwide who may be affected.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed a
trade agreement often called a treaty, though it is not a treaty in
the strict sense. The Constitution requires that a treaty be
approved by two-thirds of the Senate. Ever since the Senate rejected
the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I, presidents have
preferred to use simpler ``executive agreements.''
   These are put into effect much more easily.
   Charles Maechling, a former State Department official, estimated
that about 60 treaties _ which had to take that form _ are awaiting
ratification in the Senate now. Sometimes, when the president sees
possible trouble ahead, he does not even ask the Senate to approve a
treaty. President Carter held back the Strategic Arms Limitation
Treaty after Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan in 1979.
   Countries with parliamentary systems do not have this kind of
complication. When their executives make major decisions their
legislators either approve or face the threat of a new election.
   Congress has required that they review trade agreements if they
are made with countries that have been under communist rule. It was
busy this week ironing out a constitutional difficulty on the
procedure. Such agreements need a simple majority vote in both
houses.
   Bush has said he would wait to send Congress the agreement with
the Soviets until the Supreme Soviet has passed a new law allowing
all its citizens to emigrate more freely.
   Other accords not subject to the same law often are sent to
Congress anyway. Influential members might be offended if they were
not. When members of Congress are insulted they may hold back the
funds to carry out agreements.
   ``The executive pretty well has to flash them by Congress,'' said
Maechling, who has worked on many pacts.
   He is now a visiting scholar at the Brookings Institution, a
private study group on public policy.
   An accord between Bush and Gorbachev on chemical weapons was
designed to give a push to a pact that will bring a ban by as many
governments as are willing to sign. President Sadaq Hussein of Iraq
emphasized the importance of that in April when he threatened to
``make the fire eat half of Israel.'' Chemical weapons are much
cheaper and easier for Third World countries to make than nuclear
weapons.
   The ban will be called a ``convention,'' which Maechling said was
just a treaty under another name. One official suggested that the
word ``convention'' may sound less forbidding but usually calls for
the same action by the Senate as a treaty does.
   Some accords get negotiated far down the bureaucratic line by
lower-level officials and may not go before Congress at all.
   ``Back in the 1970s when Henry Kissinger was secretary of state
and he was trying to negotiate detente with the Soviet Union,
somebody he never heard of _ the chairman of the Maritime
Commission, I think _ negotiated an agreement on shipping with the
Soviets,'' Maechling said.
   ``Kissinger was furious. He only found out about it when the
agreement worked its way up through the bureaucracy.''
   This time it was announced during Gorbachev's visit that
Secretary of State James A. Baker III or other officials had
negotiated, among a long series of accords, one that opens 42 ports
in this country and 42 in the Soviet Union.
   The U.S. negotiator was Warren G. Leback, a former merchant ship
captain who holds the title of maritime administrator.

   Kari Geller's struggle against crippling
illness has taught her to savor the simple joys that other
teen-agers often overlook _ the wonder of a blade of grass, sunlight
glinting on the surf, a mother's inexhaustible love.
   The story of 18-year-old Miss Geller's fight to overcome a
devastating muscle ailment is told in her first achievement as a
budding playwright, a one-act drama that premiered Monday at the
Kennedy Center.
   The play, titled ``The Waiting,'' was one of three winners of the
1990 Young Playwrights Award from Very Special Arts, a non-profit
educational affiliate of the Kennedy Center, which provides arts
programs for the mentally and physically handicapped.
   A central figure in Miss Geller's highly personal play is based
on her mother, Karla Geller, 50, who relived her childhood bout with
polio when her daughter was stricken with encephalitis, a viral
infection of the brain, at the age of 15.
   ``She was an incredible help to me,'' said Miss Geller, a high
school senior in San Clemente, Calif. ``She was such a role model.
She showed me that I was not alone. She didn't once let me know she
was scared. She was so strong throughout that she made me strong.''
   Miss Geller's ailment, formally known as ``post-encephalitic
muscular dystonia,'' involved a gradual constriction of her muscles
that left her hands clenched tightly, her neck immobilized and her
feet bowed and twisted inward.
   After three years of painful physical therapy that included
horseback riding to improve her balance and coordination, Miss
Geller's handicap is barely noticeable today. She walks with leg
braces and has regained the use of the thumb and forefinger on each
hand.
   She says she hardly notices, either, unless she tries something
like piano playing.
   ``I don't let it get in my way,'' she said after receiving her
award from Jean Kennedy Smith, founder of Very Special Arts, and a
hug from Sabrina Le Beauf, a star of ``The Cosby Show.''
   Miss Geller, a member of the Laguna Playhouse Youth Theater,
plans to enter the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia this
fall to pursue a drama career.
   She said her illness deepened her affection for her mother, a
special education teacher in Los Angeles who still walks on crutches.
   ``We've always been best friends,'' the daughter said. ``She's
the most important person in my life. It's amazing how many things
we shared, the spinal taps, the therapy, the hospital nurses. When I
wrote the play, we sat down and talked for hours about her feelings
and the events of the past.''
   Her illness taught her to ``appreciate life more, and not to take
things for granted,'' Miss Geller said.
   ``I remember the first time I got out of the house,'' she said.
``Mother and I got salads and went down to the harbor and sat on the
grass. I watched the water sparkling and looked at a blade of grass
and saw how beautiful it was. I appreciated those things, finally.''
   The other Young Playwrights Award winners, whose plays also were
performed Monday, were Janet Allard, 17, of Honolulu, for ``Sand
Dragons,'' and Karen Greco, 17, of Cranston, R.I., for ``Ritty &amp;
Jesus Came to Dinner and Enjoyed a Plate of Borscht.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Blast Sad State of Reserve Cargo Ships</HEAD>

   An influential House Republican says he'll tell
the White House that ``heads ought to be rolling'' at the Maritime
Administration for its maintenance of a rusting cargo fleet that
would be activated in a national emergency.
   Rep. William S. Broomfield of Michigan told maritime officials
Monday that the National Defense Reserve Fleet's ships were
``glorified rust buckets'' and a waste of money.
   Broomfield expressed his annoyance after the government's top
maritime executive and a senior Navy official defended the fleet at
a hearing of the House Small Business subcommittee on regulation,
business opportunities and energy.
   Broomfield is the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, but
more importantly serves as the senior GOP member of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee.
   The fleet consists of 331 mostly mothballed vessels _ including
72 World War II-era ``Victory'' ships. The Maritime Administration
is spending $6.7 million this fiscal year to provide minimal
maintenance for the oldest part of the fleet and $89 million for the
newer, 96-ship Ready Reserve portion. The agency is requesting $225
million for the Ready Reserve in fiscal 1991.
   ``I agree that the outward appearance of many (reserve) ships is
poor to a visitor,'' Maritime Administrator Warren G. Leback
testified.
   But the Transportation Department official said the working
machinery is protected by dehumidification, the hulls are treated to
slow deterioration and the ships would be able to sail again, as
they did when last called to service during the Vietnam war.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chairman of the subcommittee, joined
Broomfield in protesting Leback's upbeat assessment and both
lawmakers said they would sponsor legislation to have the ships sold
to U.S. salvage companies.
   ``I wouldn't want to serve on one,'' testified Navy Cmdr. John
Polley, who criticized the state of the fleet last year in an
investigation he conducted for the Defense Department inspector
general's office.
   Broomfield said Leback's defense of the fleet, ``when the Cold
War seems to be ending'' and the nation faces a ``staggering budget
deficit,'' convinces him that ``heads ought to be rolling'' at the
Maritime Administration. He vowed to ``get to the White House'' with
his complaint.
   Wyden said, ``The taxpayers are getting repeatedly fleeced ...
for these maritime cadavers.'' He accused the Maritime
Administration of ``running a subsidy program'' for foreign salvage
companies, because ships leaving the fleet went to overseas scrap
yards.
   Jonathan D. Kaskin, director of the Navy's Strategic Sealift
Division, told the subcommittee that the Pentagon considers the
fleet a strategic asset because modern container ships cannot carry
tanks, howitzers and other heavy equipment.
   He said the Navy wants to build the Ready Reserve to 142 ships by
1994, but in the meantime must rely on the World War II-era vessels
because ``until we get something better, this is all we've got.''
   ``You're living in never-never land,'' Wyden said.
   A recent Associated Press inspection of some ships in the fleet,
berthed in the James River at Fort Eustis, Va., revealed rusted and
broken railings, paint peeling all along the exterior and even
ankle-high grass growing through wooden deck boards.
   Below decks were mattresses on metal bunk beds, dusty lockers,
old mess halls, crank-style telephones, huge ovens and steel cooking
pots.
   The 96 vessels in the Ready Reserve part of the fleet are
designated to sail on five to 20 days' notice. An additional 42 are
so old they will be used as target practice for Navy gunners, sunk
to become reefs or traded to salvage companies for newer ships. The
remaining ships are supposed to be seaworthy on 30 to 120 days'
notice.
   Except for the Ready Reserve, which is spread out across the
country, the reserve fleet is located at Fort Eustis, near Norfolk;
at Beaumont, Texas, and in Suisun Bay near San Francisco.
   Leback said the Maritime Administration was forced to sell its
disposable ships to foreign rather than U.S. scrap yards because the
agency ``has a responsibility to obtain the highest possible return
on these government assets.''
   He testified _ and U.S. salvage industry officials agreed _ that
the domestic industry cannot outbid foreign firms because of
environmental and workplace safety regulations imposed on American
firms.
   The industry representatives said U.S. companies would bid on the
jobs if a law were passed to require that the work go to domestic
concerns.

   Allen Ginsberg wants a parents' group to
apologize for requesting that high school students have restricted
access to an anthology of his poems.
   The group, Coalition of Concerned Minority Parents, also
criticized the lack of black authors in the library of North Central
High School.
   ``If my work were taken out of libraries, censors would have
excuses to take out many other basic texts of early black
cultures,'' Ginsberg wrote May 17 in a letter to Mmoja Ajabu, a
group spokesman.
   Ginsberg, 64, said the group owed him an apology or at least an
acknowledgment that his work is not in opposition to their ideas.
   Ajabu said he intends to reply to Ginsberg but not apologize. He
said since the book described homosexual activity, ``We felt it
should be under the instruction of an adult who is aware that it is
not the norm.''
   The school decided in November to continue to allow unrestricted
student access to ``Collected Poems _ 1947 to 1980,'' an anthology
recommended for independent study.

   What if Mikhail Gorbachev had shown up as
scheduled? Even with the Soviet president a no-show, the Brand
family found its dairy farm swamped with reporters.
   ``It's still been very busy,'' Cecilia Brand said in between
interviews Monday. ``One of the TV channels came out. We've had a
couple of interviews with farm magazines. I suspect that after
tomorrow things will settle down.''
   The Brands said another hectic day was likely today, when plans
called for a bald eagle to be set free to honor Gorbachev's visit to
Minnesota. The bird was scheduled to be released during Gorbachev's
canceled visit to the farm on Sunday.
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, dropped the planned 25-minute
visit because they were running behind schedule. But they met the
Brands on the airport tarmac before their departure Sunday night.

   Here are excerpts from Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's address to West Coast business leaders Monday:
   
   I would like to point out that this summit meeting with President
Bush has placed our relations on a new level and I believe this is
the deepest result of the summit. I think this is consistent with
the wishes of the Soviet and American people. ... and with the
wishes of the entire world community. ...
   Without any regret we are saying farewell to the Cold War and I
think and hope that we have entered a long period of peace. ...
   Over these days, in Washington, yesterday in the state of
Minnesota and today in San Francisco and at Stanford, I've been able
to say quite a few things that I wanted to say to the American
people. It is difficult to avoid repeating myself but in such
situations ... in a way repetition results in understanding the
logic of things and therefore I would like to emphasize once again
our interests here and I believe that is also consistent with the
interests of the American people.
   Also speaking of universal values and also the values of Islam,
don't be surprised there is one very interesting proverb in the
Islamic tradition which says, ``Repetition does not spoil the
prayer.'' ...
   Of course, I cannot say we can be pleased as to the state of our
economic relations and the scale of our economic relations. I
currently foresee greater activity in this area. ...
   I've been advocating for many years greater economic dependence
of the Soviet Union on the United States and of the United States on
the Soviet Union. ... It is very difficult to expect that the
dynamism that we see now for our relations maintains its momentum
and gains greater impetus. I think without progress and economic
cooperation this would be simply impossible. ...
   Now we stand on the threshold of what's called change in the
history of our country for many years. We will be moving toward a
new format of new economic life. We will be basing our economy on
market principles. We will be creating the infrastructure that will
open up the road to market relations. ...
   We have to decide now in our country about what kind of Soviet
Union we're going to have in the years to come. The combination of
political reform, of our innovations, the new distributions of
functions between legislative and executive political power and
party, a combination of all the other changes under way within the
overall process of implementing glasnost, places our society on a
whole new level. ...
   I believe that since the Soviet Union is moving around the path
of democratization, decentralization, glasnost, greater freedom in
whole areas ... I believe that a Soviet Union of this kind is what
all of you need. ...
   We are now watching those who maybe are risking something but who
are willing to cooperate and watching those who are standing on the
sidelines thinking that those who cooperate with us now will in the
future ... obtain ... more full cooperation in our market. ...
   We are already entering a world of greater trust and greater
mutual understanding and interaction. We now have the trade
agreement. Of course, that will not be of much practicality right
now for the period of transition. In addressing most difficulties in
our economy this is not of great practical significance. But it is
of great political importance, which I have to think is no less
meaningful. ...
   American business should now look for ways to enter our market,
look for ways to find new forms of cooperation so that once the
agreement is ratified they will be able to use all the potential
inherent in that agreement. ...
   I think the essence of what is happening here with economic
cooperation between our governments is that we are laying the
foundations of stable, depoliticized and mutual beneficial
co-development. ...
   We are moving also toward convertibility of the ruble. We used to
think that this was rather for the distant future, but we now think
that since we are trying to integrate into the world market and
become an organic part of the world economy we will have to achieve
convertibility of the ruble in a shorter period of time. ...
   The (Soviet) Far East today has tremendous potential. It has
about one-third of the reserves of important natural resources. ...
However, industry there is not well-developed, accounting for only
about 3 percent of the country's industrial output. We want to
enhance the potential of the Soviet Far East and to do so would be
of great value. ...
   We could probably consider joint scientific exploration (space)
missions. I decided to speak of this exactly here because I know
that California is active in space projects. So I think this is a
promising area for cooperation between us. ...

<HEAD>SAN FRANCISCO: between us.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   You might be worried perhaps generally by the prospects of
transition into a market economy. You're asking, you're wondering,
could involvement with the Soviet Union become a trap, could you
lose money as a result. First of all you must be reminded that I am
a person who does not like adventures. I'm in favor of change, but
... I have always battled all adventurers who like to propose
change. Some people would like to propose adventuristic approaches.
I think risk is good in politics and business, but adventurism is
bad both in politics and in business.
   The current Soviet leadership is in favor of profound changes but
still it fully intends to do that in the careful way. I very much
hope we will find agreement with our people on all that we are
doing. We will continue to move along the path that we have chosen
because other people understand that this is the path on which we
must move forward. ...
   You see some unpleasant things. You see some debate. You see
there are some opponents of this change of direction. That is true
and it's unavoidable. Of course, you can debate whether it is better
to go to Camp David using a helicopter or taking a car. It depends
on what you want. On whether you want to see the woods from the
helicopter or the car but that's not a matter for much debate. But
when you are changing or replacing one model of the economy with
another model of an economy you have to do it very carefully. And
what's happening shows we are changing in a serious way and not just
sweeping the yards, as you say. ...
   I want to engage in an open honest and serious discussion and I
certainly don't want to, as they say in Italy, put spaghetti on your
head. ...
   Some people think that we have been changing course all the time.
... No we are not changing our course. We are on course. We're on
track and our overall idea is quite clear. We looked at our society
several years ago and we decided that things could not go on like
this, that our society, country has to become more dynamic and needs
oxygen, fresh air. ...
   The important thing now is just to give people a free hand and
let them be creative on the basis of new economic realities to
reveal their potential with their initiative, and we see that people
can do a great deal. ...
   We have become closer to the rest of the world. People understand
us better and appreciate us better, including the Americans and I
think that's very important. The guarantee of our success is the
powerful process of democratizing our society. We cannot turn back.
And although the path that we've chosen is difficult, it is
interesting and is open. And I think it is a very promising road.

<HEAD>Pentagon Panel Says Super Rocket Not Needed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States doesn't need a super rocket
and can rely on its fleet of expendable launch vehicles through the
end of the century, a Defense Department advisory panel says.
   Instead of building a heavy-lift booster, the Defense Science
Board said, the military should push two technical approaches that
hold promise for breakthroughs in rocket technology: the
air-breathing propulsion being developed for the National Aerospace
Plane, and nuclear engines.
   ``Although launching rockets incorporating nuclear devices
presents emotional and political difficulties, the task force review
leads us to recommend continued investment in this area,'' said the
report released Monday.
   The board's finding would, in effect, leave the Soviet Union
unchallenged in heavy-lift capacity. Its Energia is the world's most
powerful rocket, capable of putting a 220,000-pound cargo into low
Earth orbit.
   The most powerful cargo carrier used by the United States is the
space shuttle, which can lift 52,000 pounds into orbit. The biggest
expendable rocket, the Titan 4, can carry a 39,000-pound payload.
   In the Apollo moon landing program of the late 1960s and early
1970s, the United States used Saturn 5 rockets capable of lifting
310,000 pounds of cargo. But the assembly lines were shut down when
that program ended.
   The science board said it was uncomfortable with a 1987 national
security directive signed by President Reagan that called for
development of a heavy-lift launch vehicle for the anti-missile
Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Rather than developing a more powerful booster or a new family of
expendable rockets, the report said, research should concentrate on
improving rocket engines.
   ``If the rocket engines are in an advanced state of development,
a launch vehicle can be developed faster than any payload it would
be required to carry,'' it said.
   ``Unless there is a decision to deploy SDI, the annual national
security payload to orbit averages less than 600,000 pounds,'' the
report added. ``Individual payloads do not exceed 50,000 pounds. No
heavy lift requirement, with the possible exception of an experiment
for SDI, is evident.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has talked of
developing a vehicle, to be called Shuttle-C, that would substitute
a cargo canister for the space shuttle orbiter. It would be able to
lift about 150,000 pounds and be used to carry construction parts
for the space station.
   The report called also for building a second pad for launching
Titan 4 rockets at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
   ``The single Titan 4 pad at Vandenberg is a major risk,'' it
said. ``Payloads to polar orbit can only be launched from the West
Coast, and the April 1986 Titan 34D accident demonstrated how much
damage can be done to a launch complex by a booster malfunction.''

   ``When I saw his face up there, I just turned to him and said,
`What are you doing,''' Corey said. ``He said, `Just keep

   In the silent short, three of O'Keefe's male friends, dressed as

   O'Keefe, who has dated Corey for six years, had worked for a year

he told 40 friends and a newspaper reporter and photographer to join

<HEAD>Big Potential Seen for Food Ventures With Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new grain deal between the United States
and Soviet Union is small compared with potential trade in
agriculture and other farm products that could be developed, says a
food processing executive.
   George Melnykovich, president of the Food Processing Machinery
and Supplies Association, said Monday that the Soviets want to use
the methods Americans perfected for distributing food to a large
nation.
   ``For their own internal stability, they need to feed their
people,'' said Melnykovich. ``We've solved the problem.''
   But the problem American companies have with providing the
solution to the Soviets is money.
   The ruble is virtually worthless in world trade, and U.S.
business operates on the philosophy that ``if you can't get money
out, don't put money in,'' Melnykovich said.
   He is an organizer of a three-day conference in Washington that
is bringing together 55 Soviet ministers to discuss the state of the
Soviet food system and with food companies here.
   ``It's an unprecedented meeting between leaders of one U.S.
industry and top Soviet officials,'' said Anthony J.F. O'Reilly,
chief executive officer of the H.J. Heinz Co., and conference
chairman.
   ``We need all types of products,'' said Vladilen Nikitin, the
Soviet equivalent to the U.S. secretary of agriculture.
   Speaking through an interpreter, Nikitin said the conference was
a first step toward getting more U.S. agricultural commodities to
the Soviet Union.
   He also noted that he would sign an agreement on food processing
with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher on Wednesday.
   He would not say how much the Soviets were willing to spend.
   ``We would rather have joint production,'' said Nikitin.
   Americans companies are skittish about that idea because it
involves high economic risk, said Melnykovich. But he said he
thought the Soviet government would take steps soon to back its
currency with the guarantees needed to make it usable in world
commerce.
   Meanwhile, American food companies are taking steps slowly to
probe the Soviet market.
   Large companies such as Pepsico and McDonald's are making major
investments in a gamble that the ruble will be convertible
eventually.
   Smaller companies that don't have much venture capital are
looking for other ways to start doing business with the Soviets.
   ``We don't have resources on our own to go after the business,''
said Tom Madsen, president of Key Technology Inc., in Walla Walla,
Wash. which makes equipment used in cleaning, sorting and inspecting
fruits and vegetables. ``We can act as subcontracters.''
   Mel Jolly, of APV Crepaco in Chicago, said his company is
converting a distillery in the Soviet Union into a bakery in a
project being financed by a British firm.
   ``It's the ideal three-partner association,'' Jolly said. The big
companies invest directly with the Soviets with an eye toward future
benefits. The smaller firms hire on with the bigger ones and get
immediate payment in the currency of their choice.
   The Soviet delegation also was looking at the conference for
equipment companies to convert defense plants into food processing
facilities, said Melnykovich.
   ``That's their peace dividend,'' he said.
   The United States and Soviet Union have had grain deals since
1976, but they have been virtually the only significant trade
between the superpowers.
   The latest, five-year grain agreement, signed last Friday by
President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev had been
negotiated in March and came as no surprise. It replaces a 1983
agreement that expires Dec. 31.
   Under the pact, the Soviets agreed to annually buy at least 10
million tons of U.S. grain, an increase from the current 9 million
tons.
   Soviet grain purchases in most years have exceeded the required
minimums. In 1988-89, for example, sales were more than double the
specified minimum.
   The Kremlin will have some greater year-to-year flexibility under
the new arrangement by being allowed to choose between wheat and
feed grains, although over the life of the pact the minimums will be
met, officials said.
   The Soviets will be committed to buying at least 4 million tons
each of wheat and feed grains. However, in any one year Moscow may
substitute up to 750,000 tons of one commodity for the other.
   For the first time, the pact includes barley and sorghum as feed
grains.
   Additional flexibility also was provided by giving Moscow
automatic permission to buy up to 14 million tons of grain annually
without further discussion with Washington.
   The automatic limit under the current pact is 12 million tons,
although the United States has routinely increased that to fit
Soviet needs.
   As of May 31, the Soviets had bought more than 16.7 million tons
of U.S. wheat and corn under the current agreement for delivery this
year. Last year's sales totaled a record 21.7 million tons.

   William J. Bennett knew he was going to be
giving up the big bucks when he returned from private life to public
office, and new financial disclosure forms indicate he got what he
expected.
   During the first 2{ months before he became director of the
Office of National Drug Control Policy March 10, Bennett earned
$80,246 from speeches and consulting work plus $25,962 in salary as
president of The Madison Center, a private policy research group he
created.
   If the $106,208 income from the early months had held up
throughout 1989, he could have earned about $550,000, not including
interest on savings.
   Instead, the government started paying him after March 10 at the
rate of $99,500 for a full year, or about $80,000 for the rest of
1989.
   Adding that salary to the earnings of the first couple of months
plus his declared interest earnings gave Bennett an approximate
income of $191,209 to $201,208 for 1989.
   His interest earnings totaled between $5,001 and $15,000.
   ``I was told it would have been a very good year for me,''
Bennett said shortly before taking office, reflecting on his
expected nose dive in take-home pay.
   Some other White House aides have managed to remain wealthy in
public service, while others, such as Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater, have not.
   Bennett, known as one of the poorest members of President
Reagan's Cabinet when he was education secretary, ``turned down $1.5
million in lectures in 1989,'' when President Bush nominated him to
the drug policy job, a lecture-circuit industry source said at the
time.
   The financial disclosure forms indicate Bennett's cash assets
suffered somewhat as a result of his new employment.
   In 1988, Bennett's assets ranged from $301,003 to $356,002 and
up, according to the forms, which only require broad ranges to be
reported and do not require listing such personal items as homes or
cars.
   Bennett told the Senate Judiciary Committee in early 1989 that
his net worth was about $432,600.
   For 1989, Bennett's assets ranged from $150,002 to $350,000.
   When Bennett resigned as Reagan's education secretary on Sept.
20, 1988, he reported having a savings account worth less than
$1,001. The former philosophy professor had been chairman of the
National Endowment for the Humanities for four years before becoming
education secretary in 1985.
   While Bennett was out of office in late 1988, he signed a
contract with Simon &amp; Shuster publishers in New York to write two
books, neither of which has yet been published, and he received
advances of $187,500.
   Bennett's form also said he resigned from positions as consultant
or member of the board of several foundations or public policy
research groups.
   Sig Rogich, who orchestrates President Bush's public appearances,
remains a multimillionaire from his advertising business and
holdings in radio, real estate and other ventures, according to
financial disclosure reports released Monday by White House general
counsel Boyden Gray.
   Rogich reported assets of at least $3.9 million to $5.5 million
or more, and net income on his holdings in the range of $180,549 to
$238,544 or more. His interests included an advertising firm, radio
stations, mobile billboards and a bar in Truckee, Calif.
   At the other end of the spectrum, Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's press
secretary, listed assets ranging from $17,005 to $55,000 and outside
income of $2,722 to $4,520.
   Rogich, in a telephone interview from California where he was
traveling with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said he had
put his holdings in a blind trust and ordered his trustee to sell
his stocks.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu is still on leave from
Tufts University as an engineering professor, but he reported he
will not accept tuition breaks or other faculty benefits for his
children while he works in Washington.
   Sununu, a former governor of New Hampshire, reported assets
ranging from $422,008 to more than $1 million, and income apart from
his White House salary ranging from $15,506 to $55,000. He also drew
$9,151 from New Hampshire for his final weeks as governor.
   Robert Gates, the deputy national security adviser to the
president and former career CIA man, reported assets ranging from
$33,005 to $115,000 and outside income of $2,305 to $8,000.

<TEXT>
   The marriage of President Carlos
Menem and his wife Zulema had the trappings of a fairy tale.
   Children of Syrian immigrants, they met during a visit to the old
country, married after a whirlwind courtship and raised a son and
daughter while Menem's political star took him from a jail cell to a
governor's mansion to the presidency.
   Now, as they are on the verge of a very public break-up, their
actions are the stuff of soap operas.
   Mrs. Menem denounces the father of her children as a
``womanizer'' and fires political broadsides at her husband. Menem's
social policies are inhuman, she says, his economic plan doomed and
his staff corrupt.
   After complaining earlier this year that telephones at the
presidential residence were tapped, Mrs. Menem walked out. Last
month, Menem did the same and has since slept in government offices
and the apartments of friends.
   Magazines and newspapers have had a field day covering the story,
with juicy facts and rumors splashed on covers and front pages.
   Menem is laying legal groundwork to boot Mrs. Menem from the
residence if she won't leave on her own.
   The whole affair is ``grotesque,'' says Menem, 59. He usually
refuses to comment on developments, but said ``I don't know whether
to get mad or laugh'' when asked about her claim he has been
``kidnapped'' by his aides.
   Mrs. Menem, 46, declined through her press secretary to be
interviewed on the subject.
   Residents of this nominally Roman Catholic nation seem intrigued
but hardly scandalized by the marital feud. Menem-watchers say it
hasn't affected his policies, public image or relations with the
church.
   ``Everyone knows their last reconciliation was a political act to
help him win the election'' in May 1989, said Nolberto Fernandez,
editor of the celebrity magazine ``La Revista.''
   ``It's not a political `problem' for him,'' said pollster Manuel
Mora y Araujo. ``That's what she would like it to be, but so far she
hasn't been successful in making it one.''
   The Menems have had a stormy relationship for years. Both are
ambitious, determined, quick-tongued and hot-tempered.
   An avid sportsman who races speedboats and rally cars, Menem has
made no secret of his attraction to other women. Mrs. Menem, a
striking blonde, has been linked with other men.
   By some accounts, their marriage in October 1966 was arranged by
their Moslem parents. Menem was reported to have been in love with a
young divorcee he continued to see for years after the wedding.
   Following the March 1976 coup that toppled President Isabel
Peron, Menem, a provincial governor and leading member of the
populist Peronist Party, was jailed for three years, then put under
house arrest.
   The couple did not get together immediately after his release.
When they did, they split up again in 1984. A second reconciliation,
at the urging of papal nuncio Ubaldo Calabresi, came four years
later on the eve of a crucial primary election.
   Politics, not love, seems at the heart of their conflict.
   ``She wants a formal political position and he refuses to give
her one,'' said a Peronist official, who commented on condition his
name not be disclosed.
   During the election campaign, the First Lady-to-be tried to evoke
comparisons with Evita, the wife of Juan Peron who helped him win
election as president in 1946 and endeared herself to millions of
poor Argentines with her charitable works. Menem did not help; the
effort flopped.
   Mrs. Menem, a Moslem who has hinted her husband's conversion to
Catholicism _ the state religion to which all presidents must adhere
_ was something less than an act of faith, also said during the
campaign:
   ``I support Carlos Menem, but I want people to know I'm not here
just as a symbol. I'm going to act. I'm going to do things. I'm
going to work.''
   During the 11 months of Menem's presidency, Mrs. Menem has raised
funds for schools and hospitals. But while her sister and cousin
have been appointed to high posts, she has not.
   Asked whether Mrs. Menem's connections with labor leader Saul
Ubaldini, retired army rebel Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin and other
influential critics of her husband eventually might force Menem to
see things her way, the Peronist official said:
   ``Not at all. It's not just that Menem has stood up to tougher
opponents as much as he never `gives' anything to anybody.
Sometimes, he seems to. With her, he's not even pretending.''

   Jim Wright expresses little bitterness
or remorse over his downfall as House speaker after 34 years in
Congress and spends his time a year later with gardening, lecturing
and family.
   ``I didn't get everything done that I wanted to, but for three
and a half decades I was able to ... apply my wits and my intellect
and my physical strength to some of the most intractable problems
and see if I could make them budge,'' Wright said.
   ``That was a great gift. Not many people are given that. So, why
shouldn't I feel fortunate?'' he said in a recent interview.
   A relaxed, suntanned Wright, 67, reflected on the benefits of his
resignation, which be blames on political enemies, as he sat in his
cluttered Fort Worth office May 31. Exactly a year earlier he gave
his resignation speech, and he formally relinquished the speaker's
post on June 6, 1989.
   ``Now I'm home, among people whom I know, who know me,'' Wright
said. ``I am able to do a lot of things that I denied myself during
those years when I was trying to be a leader.''
   Wright stepped down after the House Ethics Committee said he
violated House rules 69 times involving sales of his book,
``Reflections of a Public Man,'' and in business deals with his
friend George Mallick of Fort Worth.
   He is fatalistic about his resignation, which came when the
longtime Democratic leader had been speaker for about two years.
   ``There were so many peculiar circumstances that fell together to
create this jigsaw puzzle out of which there was no escape, none of
them logical, none of them, to my mind, predictable ... that I'm
inclined to think that that's what was supposed to be,'' Wright said.
   Wright's office is cluttered with memorabilia and boxes from 34
years on Capitol Hill, along with notes for a book he is writing on
Central America. Wright donated congressional memorabilia to Texas
Christian University for a memorial library.
   Wright said he's happier now than he has been in years. His wife,
Betty, whose job in a company formed by Wright and Mallick was
questioned by the ethics committee, said there are deeper feelings.
   ``I think that it leaves scars. I don't think there's any way to
get away from it,'' she said.
   Wright maintained that the ethics charges were falsely brought by
his enemies and that he never knowingly violated House rules. He
said the behavior of his nemesis, Republican Rep. Newt Gingrich, and
special prosecutor Richard Phelan amounted to ``character
assassination.''
   And Wright also blames the media for ``a voracious thirst for
scandal,'' saying reporters never gave him a chance to tell his side
of the story.
   Wright assigns scant culpability to himself.
   ``It is altogether possible that I may have been too insistent,
too demanding, too firmly determined to achieve the maximum'' in
pushing for legislation, he said.
   Wright said he didn't do enough to protect himself once the
ethics allegations started flying.
   ``I thought I could ... let the other guy wear brass knuckles if
he wanted to, and I could still win,'' he said. ``Maybe that's
hubris. It turned out that it didn't work that way.''
   Nevertheless, he insists he's not bitter.
   ``I'm happy. I'm as busy as I want to be,'' he said.
   Wright has time for things that had been squeezed out by his busy
schedule, such as having dinner with his wife and spending time with
his children and grandchildren.
   He still works long days writing, giving speeches or guest
lectures at colleges and appearing at fund-raisers for fellow
Democrats. Wright recently attended a gathering for the man who
filled his House seat, Pete Geren, who often seeks his advice.
   Wright won't criticize Tom Foley, his replacement as speaker,
saying it would be ``ungracious,'' but he does say the House today
seems to lack ``clarity and direction.''
   As for history, Wright said he doesn't worry how his life will
read.
   ``I'm at peace with myself,'' he said. ``I intend to rest my case
on the things that I was able to achieve.''

astronomy mission on hold. NASA plans a fueling test Wednesday in a
last-ditch attempt to find the leak without having to roll the
shuttle back to its hangar _ a move that would mean a month's delay.
   Discovery sustained possible damage Monday when a corner of a
payload bay door was snagged by an overhead bridge, which acts as a
crane, NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham said. The open door flexed 10
to 12 inches upward, then snapped back into position when the bridge
operator moved back.
   ``There is no visual damage. However, the orbiter has some very
critical components that aren't meant to be bent,'' Buckingham said.
Workers were checking for damage to the 60-foot door and the bridge,
which enables the door to open and close on Earth.
   The accident occurred in a hangar while Discovery was being
prepared for its October flight with the Ulysses satellite, which
will explore the Sun's poles.
   Discovery has been at the hangar since its April flight with the
Hubble Space Telescope. That mission was delayed two weeks by a
malfunctioning power unit.
   Columbia's flight with the $150 million Astro observatory was two
weeks behind schedule because of cooling system repairs when last
Wednesday's launch was scrubbed.
   NASA plans to fill about a tenth of Columbia's external tank with
liquid hydrogen to try to duplicate the conditions that existed when
the leak was detected.
   Additional sensors will be placed around the 17-inch-diameter
valve where the leak is believed to be. The area will be cleared of
workers during the test. Hydrogen is highly combustible.
   ``The longer we can't find it, the better the chances of moving
back'' to the hangar, Buckingham said. ``Right now, the chances of
not moving back are getting slimmer and slimmer.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has moved a
shuttle from the launch pad back to the hangar because of problems
three times, in 1983, 1984 and 1985.

   In a dramatic finale to Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's U.S. tour, South Korea's president said he and the
Soviet leader agreed to move toward normal relations between their
two long-hostile nations.
   The Cold War ice on the Korean peninsula ``now has begun to
crack,'' President Roh Tae-woo told reporters after a historic
meeting with Gorbachev at a San Francisco hotel Monday evening.
   ``President Gorbachev and I share the view that efforts to
normalize bilateral relations between South Korea and the Soviet
Union have already been started and will lead to the establishment
of permanent relations,'' Roh said.
   The Soviet president was more vague in his account of the meeting.
   ``We will let the fruit grow ripe, and when the fruit grows ripe,
we will eat it,'' Gorbachev said in a brief interview outside the
Soviet consul general's home, before flying back to the Soviet Union
at the end of a five-day U.S. visit.
   Although no date was set for further talks and nothing was put in
writing, the unprecedented meeting appeared to set the stage for
significant change on the divided peninsula, where for four decades
U.S.-allied South Korea has confronted Soviet-allied North Korea in
one of the world's longest-running military showdowns.
   Lee Soo-jung, an aide to Roh, was quoted by Korean reporters as
saying the two leaders agreed to develop full diplomatic relations
``in the not-distant future.'' Officials of Roh's governing party
have said since March that such relations would be established by
year's end.
   Roh said that in their private discussion he and Gorbachev
``agreed to further expand economic, scientific, technical and
cultural exchanges and cooperation between our two countries.''
   Trade between the Soviet Union and South Korea doubled to $600
million last year and was expected to surpass $1 billion this year.
South Korea's dynamic, fast-growing economy could offer the Soviets
investment and technology intheir quest to develop their own
resources.
   The South Korean leader described the talks as the beginning of a
lasting dialogue.
   ``As a result of my meeting with President Gorbachev today,
normal bilateral relations between our countries will be restored,''
he said.
   The two countries have had an unstable relationship since the
division of the peninsula and the formation of South Korea after
World War II. In the 1950-53 Korean War, the Soviets helped supply
the North Koreans, whose invasion of the south touched off the
conflict.
   The animosity began to abate in 1988 when the Soviets announced
they would participate in the Seoul Olympics, even though Communist
North Korea opted to boycott. Earlier this year, the Moscow and
Seoul governments opened consular-level offices in each other's
capitals.
   Roh and top aides had arrived Sunday morning to prepare for the
first meeting between leaders of the two nations since the partition.
   Restored ties with the Soviet Union have been a cornerstone of
the Roh administration, Korean officials have said.
   Roh said he hopes to restore diplomatic ties to North Korea and
induce that country to share the outlook of ``glasnost,'' or
openness, that Gorbachev has instilled in the Soviet Union.
   ``North Korea is no longer our rival or adversary,'' Roh said.
``It should be our partner in the quest for common prosperity.''
   South Korea has called on the Soviet Union to urge North Korea to
reduce its ``offensive military structure.''
   Roh received a string of impressive visitors at his Fairmont
Hotel residence after arriving in San Francisco, including former
President Reagan and former Secretary of State George P. Shultz. He
met early Monday with top U.S. State Department officials, including
Richard Solomon, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs, who briefed him on the summit meetings between
Gorbachev and President Bush in Washington last week.
   Roh is to meet with Bush in Washington on Wednesday to brief him
on the talks with Gorbachev and to discuss more details from last
week's summit talks.
   In a noisy demonstration outside the Fairmont, Korean-American
protesters complained that improved relations between the Soviet
Union and South Korea would only contribute to continued separation
of the two Koreas.
   ``If the Soviet Union forms full diplomatic ties with South Korea
without any change in the current policy and actions of South Korea
and the U.S., it will amount to recognizing the status quo of the
Korean division,'' the group, Mobilization for Peace and
Reunification of Korea, said in a statement.
   An improved Soviet-South Korean relationship could lead to an
accelerated withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea. The United
States already has announced plans to withdraw 7,000 of its 43,000
troops from South Korea during the next two years.

   Raisa Gorbachev inspected a corner market's
supply of Russian vodka and a fishmonger's giant crab after junking
her planned itinerary in favor of a little ``people's diplomacy.''
   ``I'm overwhelmed by this beautiful city,'' the Soviet first lady
said shortly before she and her husband, Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, left San Francisco for the Soviet Union on Monday.
   In the morning, Mrs. Gorbachev and Nancy Reagan renewed old
acquaintances, and anyone expecting a sudden frost by the bay saw
only warmth.
   ``Very nice,'' Mrs. Reagan said afterward.
   Later, after visiting Stanford University with her husband, Mrs.
Gorbachev was supposed to go to the residence of the Soviet consul
general and visit the Bank of America building to admire the city
from atop the skyscraper.
   Instead, she took off on her own whirlwind tour of San Francisco,
bewildering Secret Service men, public relations staff and reporters.
   In the space of an hour, her limousine cruised through Chinatown,
the Financial District, Fisherman's Wharf and the Marina district,
damaged in last October's earthquake.
   ``It seems while I was busy in session, she was doing the
sightseeing _ people's diplomacy,'' joked her husband.
   Mrs. Gorbachev's first stop was in the Twin Peaks neighborhood.
Hea Kim, who runs the New Terrace Market with her husband, Jin Kim,
was watching TV coverage of the Soviet president's visit when in
swept Mrs. Gorbachev.
   ``I didn't know about it at all,'' Mrs. Kim said. ``I was
surprised.''
   Mrs. Gorbachev spent about 10 minutes asking about Mrs. Kim's
merchandise.
   ``I think she wanted to know if we carry Stolichnaya,'' Mrs. Kim
said of the popular imported Soviet vodka. ``Then she looked at the
Smirnoff, the kind made in the U.S.''
   Mrs. Gorbachev smiled when she learned Stolichnaya was the
store's best-selling brand, Mrs. Kim said.
   At Fisherman's Wharf, Joe Rosquites, who sells crab, was saving a
``champion crab'' for Mrs. Gorbachev. As the motorcade approached,
he held up a crustacean, and the limousine stopped, the door open,
for a moment.
   ``I held a crab up and shook it, and she looked at it and her
face lit up,'' Rosquites said. ``I am kind of upset she didn't stop,
though. I was looking for a decent-size tip.''
   Elsewhere, Mrs. Gorbachev sat in a cable car, chatting with the
driver and an assistant and ringing the bell.
   ``The cable car operator suggested he had a friend who could do
Mrs. Gorbachev's hairstyle for free,'' the Gorbachevs' interpreter
said later.
   The limousine also drove through the Marina district, where
damage from last year's quake can still be seen.
   Earlier, Former President Reagan and his wife joined the
Gorbachevs for about an hour at the consul general's home, and Mrs.
Reagan later denied suggestions she and Mrs. Gorbachev once were
uncomfortable with each other.
   ``I think there's been a great misunderstanding about our
relationship,'' Mrs. Reagan said. ``It was a very different time. We
were plowing new ground.''
   There was no mention of Mrs. Reagan's complaint, in her book,
``My Turn,'' that Mrs. Gorbachev ``never stopped talking. Or
lecturing, to be more accurate.''

   Apple Computer chief John Sculley led the
cheers for Mikhail Gorbachev's new dogma: Invest in the Soviet Union
now or regret it later.
   ``It's a big market out there and I think we all want to be part
of it,'' Sculley said Monday after the Soviet president implored the
West Coast's business elite to help transform Soviet society through
capital and technology.
   ``If you're sitting on the sidelines and you think you can wait a
few years just to see how things turn out, don't plan on being in,''
Sculley said.
   His remarks echoed Gorbachev's at a luncheon at the plush
Fairmont Hotel, attended by billionaires like McDonald's heiress
Joan Kroc, the governors of California, Oregon, Washington and
Hawaii, and numerous top executives. Their reviews of Gorbachev were
overwhelmingly positive.
   Gorbachev said the Soviets desperately need investment now and
will remember those who provide it. The transition to a market-based
economy will continue, if haltingly at times, he said. And he
promised to make it easier for Western businessmen to function in
the way to which they are accustomed.
   ``Our society, our country, has to become more dynamic. It needs
oxygen, fresh air,'' he said to loud applause.
   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union has tempting investment
opportunities, especially in the rich, largely untapped natural
resources in the nation's easternmost regions.
   He also said California aerospace companies should undertake
joint ventures to build airplanes and spacecraft with the Soviets as
both sides produce fewer weapons.
   Richard Matzke, president of Chevron Overseas Petroleum, which
just struck a deal to study developing the vast Tengiz oil field in
a joint venture with the Soviets, was impressed by Gorbachev's
commitment to making the ruble convertible into other currencies.
That would remove one of the biggest obstacles to freer trade with
the West.
   ``He said they intended to move towards the convertibility of the
ruble faster rather than slower,'' Matzke said. ``Of course, he
didn't give any specifics about that, and we all recognize that it's
a tremendous task for the Soviet Union.''
   In Minneapolis, where Gorbachev issued a similar warning to about
100 business leaders that those who ``stand on the sidelines'' will
remain there for years, a businessman said making the ruble
convertible is critical.
   ``Everything is the money problem,'' former Control Data Corp.
chief executive Robert Price said Monday. ``He can't wish it to go
away. He can't and we can't.''
   Many of the executives at the lunch already have struck deals
with the Soviets that would have seemed unusual or impossible not
long ago. Giancarlo Parretti's Pathe Communications filmed the Sean
Connery spy movie ``The Russia House'' there _ one of a spate of
U.S. movies lured recently by the Soviets.
   Those kinds of ventures have created huge pressures to upgrade
Soviet telephone systems _ and more work for American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, said Rhea G. Serpan, an AT&amp;T vice president.
   Sculley said the foundations of Western-style business _ phone
systems, good hotels, good airlines _ are slowly falling into place.
   ``Add to that the stability and vision of President Gorbachev and
what he is talking about and I think you've got the makings of what
can be a very exciting decade for businessmen,'' Sculley said.
   He cautioned that it will probably take 10 to 20 years ``to build
the real sort of entrepreneurial infrastructure that we're
accustomed to.'' But he added, ``Those who want to be a part of it
better start playing now.''
   Sculley said he was surprised at how detailed Gorbachev was in
emphasizing radical economic changes under way in the Soviet Union:
efforts to help get profits out of the country; allowing foreign
business people to head joint ventures; encouraging entrepreneurs;
low tax levels during investment years.
   Such detail suggests Gorbachev is highly knowledgeable about such
issues and considers them important, Sculley said.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, celebrating the end of
the Cold War, embraced former arch-enemy South Korea, thrilled
crowds of ordinary San Franciscans, won the applause of businessmen
and then flew home to his own deeply troubled nation.
   In a major speech on the last day of a five-day U.S. visit, the
Soviet president proclaimed, ``The Cold War is now behind us. Let us
not wrangle over who won it.''
   Later Monday, speaking to leaders of more than 100 major U.S.
companies, the Kremlin chief earned praise with promises to speed up
the exchange of rubles for dollars, streamline the Soviet
bureaucracy, and turn his land into a new frontier of capitalism.
   Apple Computer Inc. Chairman John Sculley said Gorbachev's
presentation also reassured executives wary that the Soviet Union's
course depends only on Gorbachev's political fortunes.
   ``He has indicated ... that maybe his personal future is
uncertain, and he's been quite honest about that,'' Sculley said.
``But I think he's also said he's got to stand up to adventurism,
that he believes in profound change, that he is on a steady course,
that he is not going to deviate from that.''
   In the earlier speech at Stanford University, where thousands of
students hailed him with chants of ``Gorby! Gorby!'' the Soviet
leader touched on global themes, advocating a system of
international alliances that unites rather than divides the world _
an apparent bid for security arrangements broader than the U.S.-led
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   He called for a ``new approach to the structures of security ...
and alliance building'' that would result in a ``unity ... worthy of
the life of a human being.''
   He also implored scientists in both countries to join in
determining how nuclear weapons could be destroyed without harming
people or the environment.
   It was bravura performance by Gorbachev, despite his obvious
fatigue after four days of summitry, a dash to Minnesota, and a
22-hour spin around the San Francisco area that featured a brief
reunion with former President Reagan.
   The clamor of thousands of protesters _ Armenians, Lithuanians,
Estonians, Latvians, Palestinians, Koreans, Eritreans from embattled
Ethiopia _ competed with the cheers of thousands of others crowded
behind police barriers and craning for a glimpse of Gorbachev.
   But in all the din and pomp of the long day, a historic moment
occurred quietly behind closed doors when the Soviet leader stepped
into the tower of the posh Fairmont Hotel and shook hands with South
Korean President Roh Tae-woo.
   That simple gesture and the one-hour talk that ensued
symbolically ended 45 years of enmity and heralded a possibly huge
shift in the political landscape of Asia.
   Gorbachev and Roh, in agreeing to work toward establishing full
diplomatic relations, put pressure on North Korea to reconcile with
the South and announced to a reluctant Japan that the Soviets are
serious about doing business with Asia.
   ``As a result of my meeting with President Gorbachev today,
normal bilateral relations between our countries will be restored,''
Roh said. ``The Cold War ice on the Korean peninsula has now begun
to crack.
   Though nothing was put in writing, Roh said the two countries
plan to boost economic and trade ties. Soviet-South Korean trade
doubled to $600 million in 1989, and is expected to surpass $1
billion this year.
   The Soviet president, cautious not to offend longtime ally North
Korea, was less exuberant in his assessment of the meeting, although
he did not deny Roh's interpretation of the importance of the
discussion.
   ``We will let the fruit grow ripe, and when the fruit grows ripe,
we will eat it,'' Gorbachev said cryptically at a separate meeting
with reporters.
   He and his wife, Raisa, then wound up their first cross-country
U.S. trip and flew home to the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet president had business on his mind most of the day in
San Francisco, especially when he spoke to the gathering of
prominent executives.
   He acknowledged some early failures of the Soviet system to open
up its markets, but declared the country was on an irreversible path
toward free trade and called for greater cooperation with the United
States. If the current trend toward economic cooperation were to
falter, he said, U.S.-Soviet relations would suffer.
   He also warned U.S. businessmen they could be left behind if they
are slow to react to the changes in the Soviet Union.
   ``We are now watching those who maybe are risking something but
who are willing to cooperate, and watching those who are standing on
the sidelines,'' he said.
   ``American business should now look for ways to enter our market,
look for ways to find new forms of cooperation so that once the
(U.S.-Soviet trade) agreement is ratified they will be able to use
all the potential inherent in that agreement.''

<HEAD>Authorities Reopen Tiananmen Square, Campuses Quiet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities reopened Tiananmen Square to the
public today after closing it for four days that coincided with the
first anniversary of the bloody military suppression of a massive
pro-democracy movement.
   At the same time, the Foreign Ministry issued a ``serious
warning'' to foreign journalists, accusing some of collaborating
with opposition activists involved in ``illegal anti-government
activities.''
   The warning came after numerous foreign reporters were detained
or beaten by security forces while covering the anniversary of the
June 3-4, 1989 army attack that crushed the student-led
pro-democracy movement.
   Tiananmen Square, the focal point of last year's seven-week
pro-democracy movement, had been closed since Friday and sealed off
by armed police to prevent any anniversary commemorations. Although
the square was reopened, armed police still patrolled adjoining
streets.
   In the university district in northwest Beijing that was the
scene of a daring anti-government protest on Sunday night, all was
quiet.
   During the night, helmeted police with automatic rifles set up
roadblocks in the district, checking identification papers and
searching cars. They were withdrawn by dawn.
   Many students had said they wanted to stage demonstrations to pay
tribute to the hundreds and perhaps thousands of people who were
slain by the army last June.
   But plans for an overnight candlelight vigil, a day of fasting
and even a commemorative march to Tiananmen Square were abandoned
after school officials issued stern warnings and convoys of security
vehicles circled campuses with their lights flashing.
   ``Just seeing the convoys terrified me,'' said a People's
University sophomore.
   On Sunday night, students at Beijing University threw bottles and
debris at police vehicles patrolling the campus and up to 1,000
students later marched through the campus and held a rally.
   At both Beijing and Qinghua universities, there was a sense of
expectation Monday night, but nothing happened other than some
shouting, singing and the smashing of beer bottles. ``Bottle'' in
Chinese sounds much like the name of senior leader Deng Xiaoping,
who approved the crackdown.
   The official Beijing Daily today ran a long front-page article
extolling the progress made in the country since the crushing of
what Communist authorities call ``the counter-revolutionary
rebellion.''
   ``It's not that the orioles sing and swallows dart everywhere and
all is praises and appreciation, but one year after the baptism of
blood and fire, it seems ... that spring is very much in the air,''
it said.
   Security in Beijing the past three days was the heaviest since
martial law was lifted in January. The few people who attempted
protests near Tiananmen Square were quickly arrested.
   More than a dozen foreign journalists were either detained,
roughed up or had guns pointed in their faces by police while
attempting to cover events Sunday and Monday near Tiananmen Square
and the university campuses.
   Jim Munson, the Beijing bureau chief of Canadian TV and president
of the Foreign Correspondents Club, said he was summoned to the
Foreign Ministry today for a warning talk about the activities of
foreign journalists.
   Liu Rucai, division chief of the Information Department, told
Munson that a small number of journalists ``have connections with
some Chinese people who have engineered illegal activities and even
engage themselves in activities incompatible with their status as
journalists.''
   He also accused foreign journalists of entering university
campuses without authorization and ``conducting illegal press
coverage activities,'' according to an excerpted transcript of the
meeting provided by Munson.
   Liu did not specify what he meant by ``illegal activities''
involving Chinese citizens or foreign journalists.
   Liu also said any protest by the Foreign Correspondents Club,
presumably about police harassment, would be ``utterly
unreasonable.'' He warned Munson that as head of the foreign
correspondents group he would be held responsible for any
consequences arising from a protest.
   Foreign journalists say the harassment was unprovoked and took
place in public areas where there are no restrictions on press
coverage.
   U.S. State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler on Monday
expressed displeasure over the harassment of journalists in Beijing,
and Chinese diplomats in Washington were reportedly called in over
the matter.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange erased its
morning gains and closed marginally lower Tuesday, while the dollar
ended slightly higher against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 152.43 yen, up 0.01 yen from Monday's
152.42-yen finish. The dollar opened at 152.36 yen and ranged
between 152.15 yen and 152.58 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 3.75 points, or 0.01
percent, ending the day at 32,921.62. The index gained 84.21 points
at the end of the morning session before falling back in the
afternoon.
   Traders said the index fell in the afternoon because market
players stepped off to the sidelines while the yen remained weak
against the dollar.
   Currency dealers said the dollar-yen rate was moving narrowly in
the absence of market-affecting news.
   ``Participants generally think the U.S. economy is not doing very
well, which should discourage their interest in the dollar. However,
the dollar is not falling that much because there is no reason to
buy the yen against the dollar, either,'' said Masato Hayashi, a
dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   Unless there is a specific reason to buy the yen, the dollar will
stay around the current level, and market players will continue to
make small position adjustments, he said.

<HEAD>NBC News Chief Predicts Resurgence for ``Today''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC News President Michael Gartner admitted to
affiliates that changes he approved in the ``Today'' show put it in
a slump, but he predicted it will be back on top in the morning
ratings.
   Gartner also announced Monday the start in January of a 24-hour
NBC News channel for the network's 208 affiliates.
   Affiliate executives were heading to Capitol Hill today to seek
help on cable issues and urge that NBC and its network rivals be
free from federal bans on financial interests in shows the networks
don't solely own.
   At the start of NBC's annual affiliates convention, Gartner
frankly addressed the decline in ``Today'' ratings since Jane Pauley
left as co-host in December.
   ``That's got to be the starting point, the willingness to admit _
in this case _ the obvious,'' said Eric Bremner of King Broadcasting
in Seattle, the new chairman of the NBC affiliates board.
   ``I think it was well-received,'' he said.
   Once first in ratings, ``Today'' has been second to ABC's ``Good
Morning America'' for 21 weeks.
   Its slide started in January after Pauley's replacement by
Deborah Norville as co-host with Bryant Gumbel. The popular Pauley,
who was unhappy with other changes on the show and asked to leave,
had been on ``Today'' for 13 years.
   To get the show moving again, Gartner brought in a new executive
producer, Tom Capra, and is bringing back former ``Today'' host Joe
Garagiola on June 11 as third co-host.
   Without mentioning specifics, Gartner told affiliates that ``we
know we screwed up the `Today' show ... he (Capra) knows what the
show needs and he knows how to provide it.
   ``Now, with the dust settled, he'll make it, we'll make it,
another winner.''
   Garagiola appeared on stage with the ``Today'' cast and kidded
with weatherman Willard Scott.
   But the affiliate executives greatest affection was for Pauley,
who got a standing ovation.
   ``I have never been happier in my work,'' said Pauley, now
preparing a series of prime time specials for NBC. She is the
substitute evening news anchor when Tom Brokaw is away.
   Gartner predicted better times ahead for the ``NBC Nightly
News,'' third in ratings for seven straight weeks. He introduced the
show's new executive producer, Steve Friedman, calling him a ``show
doctor'' who will make the newscast ``sparkle.''
   Friedman ran ``Today'' when it rose to first in ratings. He left
NBC in 1987 to create what proved a costly syndicated flop, ``USA
Today on TV.''
   The normally brash producer made no promises of a fast ratings
rise, but said there would be changes to make the newscast a
contender. He declined to announce the changes citing competitive
reasons.
   Network newscasts can ``no longer just index the day's events,''
he said. ``We can't come on and say, `These are the top stories.'
People have heard them already.
   ``We are going to do a show of interest, not the show of
record,'' he said.
   The 24-hour news service announced by Gartner will provide
affiliates with international, national, regional and breaking news
for use in their own newscasts, said Robert Horner, in charge of the
service.
   Although at first glance similar to Cable News Network, the NBC
service won't have anchors and won't transmit stories on a non-stop
basis, as CNN does.
   It is intended to help NBC stations compete with CNN's newscasts,
and to ward off further encroachments by CNN on NBC stations.
   CNN says it has 216 broadcast affiliates, of which 52 also are
NBC affiliates.
   NBC's convention will end Wednesday.

<HEAD>Officials Offer U.S. Servicemen Opportunity To Send Families Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARO CORTES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>

   The U.S. military is offering to
evacuate the families of American servicemen at government expense
following the recent slayings of Americans and rebel threats of more
attacks.
   A military spokesman said today that U.S. service personnel have
until Thursday to tell officials whether they want their families
sent home.
   ``We have asked those who have families to tell us when they
would like to ship their dependents back before their tour ends,''
said Lt. Col. Ronald Rand, spokesman for Clark Air Base, 50 miles
north of Manila.
   Rand did not say what would happen if service members decided
later to return their dependents.
   Adm. Huntington Hardisty, commander of U.S. forces in the
Pacific, authorized a program which allows a serviceman at any of
the six U.S. bases in the Philippines to send members of his family
home at government expense before his tour of duty ends, Rand said.
   Rand said a U.S. government-sponsored transfer of dependents of
U.S. servicemen is usually done when only on exceptional cases, such
as illness. But he said a large number of requests and letters of
concern about their families forced them to adopt the program.
   A total of 40,000 Americans _ servicemen, civilian workers and
dependents _ are stationed at Clark, Subic and four other American
bases in the Philippines. At Clark alone, there are over 10,000
dependents, Rand said.
   Last month, Communist rebels killed two American airmen near
Clark and vowed more attacks until all U.S. troops leave the
country. Rebels also are suspected in the May 4 shooting death of a
Marine sergeant near Subic.
   At least eight Americans have been slain in political attacks
since April 1989. Six of the victims were servicemen or associated
with the military.
   Another American serviceman was killed Saturday night, but
American and Filipino officials said robbery _ not politics _ was
the motive this time.
   Since Friday, U.S. Defense Department civilians and military
dependents who live on Clark have been barred from leaving the base
because of Communist threats. Those living off-base have been
ordered to limit travel to essential business.
   Rand said the restrictions would last for at least two months
depending on U.S. assessment of the threat.
   The New People's Army, the military wing of the outlawed
Communist Party of the Philippines, has waged a 21-year-old
insurgency to establish a Marxist state.

<TEXT>
   AIDS experts are noncommittal, even skeptical,
about reports that a man's AIDS infection disappeared after his
blood was heat-treated, but that hasn't stopped hundreds of patients
and physicians from trying to learn more.
   Dr. Kenneth Alonso and Dr. William Logan performed the
``hyperthermia'' procedure on a 33-year-old AIDS patient with
Kaposi's sarcoma, a skin cancer commonly occurring with AIDS. The
man's blood was heated for two hours in hopes of attacking the
cancer, Alonso said.
   Soon after, the patient's raised, red skin lesions ``flattened to
scars,'' and tests for the AIDS virus have remained negative since,
Alonso said.
   ``We changed the disease. It's obvious that we did,'' Alonso
said. ``What the long term prognosis is, we have no idea.''
   Alonso said Monday he is getting some 700 calls a day from
anxious patients and doctors, following a Cable News Network report
last week. Hospitals and AIDS services organizations also are
reporting numerous inquiries.
   Alonso is quick to note that he is not claiming an AIDS cure:
``This is just what we did in a single case.''
   The patient, at least, is claiming victory. ``I'm convinced I'm
cured of AIDS,'' Carlton Crawford told the Daily Citizen News in
Dalton, his former hometown.
   AIDS specialists are reluctant to speculate about the reports.
Officials of the Centers for Disease Control and the National
Infectious Disease Institute declined to comment.
   ``A lot of us are real cautious about this,'' said Alice Trinkl,
spokeswoman for AIDS research at the University of California at San
Francisco. ``There have been so many promises made in the AIDS
area.''
   ``It is important that a scientifically balanced evaluation be
given to the situation,'' said a statement from Project Inform, a
patient advocacy group and information clearinghouse in San
Francisco. ``Over the years, far too many patients and their doctors
have loudly announced miracle cures, raising the hopes of other
patients.''
   Alonso stressed that he submitted his findings to the journal
Molecular Oncology and Tumor Pharmacotherapy, for ``normal peer
review.'' But the patient disclosed his treatment, prompting Alonso
to discuss his work publicly.
   He said he intends to perform the procedure on several more
patients, ``and see if we have made a difference.''
   ``Some researchers have told me the results replicate what they
have found in the lab,'' he added. ``That's very exciting to hear.''
   Hyperthermia, commonly used to treat infections before the advent
of antibiotics, is still used against some cancers.
   Alonso and Logan determined that the patient's sarcoma might
respond to heat treatment, then performed the hyperthermia process
at Atlanta Hospital. In February, the patient's blood was run in a
loop out of his body, through a 115-degree heater and back in, for
two hours.
   Atlanta Hospital covered the costs _ $35,000 in the average case,
Crawford said.
   The patient's body temperature rose to 107-108 degrees throughout
the procedure, Alonso said. Such a high fever could cause severe
complications under routine circumstances, but the patient's pH,
oxygen, mineral and fluid levels were carefully monitored and
maintained. ``That's why you can go through this,'' Alonso said.
   ``We treated this gentleman with Kaposi's sarcoma with heat,''
Alonso said. ``He went into complete remission.'' Blood tests and
viral cultures have remained negative for human immunodeficiency
virus since, he said.
   But Project Inform said the patient might have been
``overmedicated'' with AZT prior to the procedure, and simply
stopping the drug could have produced some improvement.
   The group also called viral cultures ``notoriously unreliable''
in determining whether a patient is infected from one day to the
next.
   ``Hyperthermia deserves serious discussion by researchers,''
Project Inform said. ``But far more needs to be known about the
obvious potential for toxicity inherent in raising a patient's core
temperature as high as that.''

<HEAD>Nikkei Down Slightly, Dollar Up Marginally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index closed
marginally lower today after early gains disappeared, and the dollar
was almost unchanged against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 3.75 points, or 0.01
percent, closing at 32,921.62. The index was up 84.21 points at the
end of the morning session but fell back in the afternoon.
   The decline came as market players stepped off to the sidelines
ahead of Thursday's final trading for June issues on the futures
market, said Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst with Nomura Securities Co.
   ``Participants were reluctant to buy as they were afraid of a
rush of arbitrage selling to take profits from price gaps between
the spot and futures markets for June issues before Thursday,'' he
said.
   The dollar's stability above 152 yen also was sending market
players to the sidelines, he said.
   Kazuyuki Suzuki, a stock trader with Daiwa Securities Co., said,
``Trading was rather quiet because participants were unable to
figure out in which direction the yen and interest rates would
move.''
   Trading was moderate, with first section volume estimated at 600
million, down from 650 million Monday.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 152.43 yen, up 0.01
yen from Monday's 152.42-yen finish. It opened at 152.36 yen and
ranged between 152.15 yen and 152.58 yen.
   The dollar now has gained 2.98 yen in the last six trading days.
   Market participants were torn between expectations of a slowdown
in the U.S. economy and optimism over the U.S.-Soviet summit in
Washington, where the two sides agreed on nuclear arms reductions,
said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan
Securities Co.
   ``They are now waiting for new market-affecting news,'' he said.
   Masato Hayashi, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, said there was
no reason to buy the yen against the dollar, either.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 88.11 points at 5 p.m. from
Monday's close of 88.36. The yield stood at 6.945 percent, up from
6.895 percent.

   Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk
and Cambodian Premier Hun Sen signed a communique today that called
for an end to hostilities but stopped short of announcing a
cease-fire in Cambodia's 11-year-old civil war.
   The powerful communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who are part of a
three-faction rebel coalition Sihanouk heads, boycotted the session.
   The statement said the factions ``should refrain from all
offensive actions'' and there should be measures to ensure a
``military standstill.'' But it said an ``actual cease-fire'' should
be realized through agreement on forming a so-called supreme
national council.
   The council has been proposed as a body joining representatives
of the resistance coalition and the Hanoi-backed Phnom Penh
government. It would administer the country in the period before a
national vote to determine Cambodia's future.
   The communique said a supreme national council should include
equal numbers from the resistance coalition and from the Phnom Penh
government and be formed by the end of July. It mentioned a future
role for the United Nations in monitoring the withdrawal of foreign
forces, the end of foreign military supplies and a cease-fire
agreement.
   The impact of the declaration on fighting in Cambodia was hard to
judge. Combat intensified in the days preceding the Tokyo conference
as the contenders sought to extend their areas of control.
   In Bangkok, Sihanouk spokesman Roland Eng said heavy fighting was
continuing and guerrilla groups had launched offensives in areas
around Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital.
   The Khmer Rouge nominal leader, Khieu Samphan, did not attend the
signing ceremony. He also boycotted the opening session Monday when
the Tokyo peace conference started.
   A statement from the Khmer Rouge was expected later. The group
had said it declined to join the conference unless it was an equal
member, rather than a part of Sihanouk's resistance coalition.
   After the Khmer Rouge boycotted the conference, informal meetings
continued, mostly in the hotel where the guerrilla delegations were
staying. Pressure came from other countries, including China, which
backs the Khmer Rouge; the United States, which backs Sihanouk while
trying to distance itself from the Khmer Rouge; and Thailand,
through which arms flow to the rebels.
   Thailand's deputy prime minister, Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who
helped arrange the talks, held separate meetings with Hun Sen and
with Sihanouk's guerrilla factions.
   Chinese Ambassador Yang Zhenya was seen leaving a corridor where
informal talks were held. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
David Lambertson called on Son Sann, the U.S. Embassy said.
Lambertson was in Tokyo for consultations and to observe the
Cambodian talks.
   The less than full success of the meeting seemed certain to
disappoint Japan, which was acting as host to its first
international peace conference since World War II.
   The meeting was heralded as a stepping-stone to a conference set
for Paris in July. Before the Khmer Rouge boycotted, the conference
was expected to be one of the rare instances in which all four
contending factions would be present.
   Sihanouk, 67, had said he intended to sign an agreement with Hun
Sen whether the Khmer Rouge came along or not, but he had to stay a
rocky course to reach that point.
   As he left for the signing ceremony with Son Sann, the
conservative leader of a guerrilla faction in his coalition,
Sihanouk said they had worked hard to move toward peace and
reconciliation ``and I am happy to be able to sign.''
   Son Sann said he had agreed to the arrangement.
   The guerrilla coalition is fighting moderate communist Hun Sen's
government, which was installed by Vietnam in 1979.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and ended the brutal
1975-79 rule of the Khmer Rouge when hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians were killed.
   Hun Sen has refused to negotiate equally with the Khmer Rouge or
allow them an equal role in a future interim government.
   Vietnam says it withdrew all its troops last September, but there
are charges that some remain.

<HEAD>Doctor Says Woman Used His Drug-Injecting Suicide Device</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The inventor of a suicide device says he
hooked an Alzheimer's disease victim to the drug-injecting apparatus
and watched her die.
   Dr. Jack Kevorkian said Janet Adkins of Portland, Ore., used the
device inside his van in a park about 40 miles north of Detroit on
Monday afternoon. She pressed a button to trigger the machine, which
injected her with a lethal dose of chemicals.
   ``The last thing Janet Adkins said was, `You just make my case
known,''' said Kevorkian, a retired pathologist.
   ``We have planned birth, why not planned death?'' he asked.
   Oakland County Prosecutor Richard Thompson said he was aware
Adkins had died in his county. He has said in the past that he
believes that assisting suicide is a crime under Michigan law;
others have interpreted the law differently.
   ``There is an ongoing investigation and I don't want to discuss
it any further,'' Thompson said.
   State police in Pontiac confirmed the woman's death and said they
are investigating. Kevorkian said he notified police after Adkins'
death.
   Kevorkian said the 54-year-old woman, her husband and a friend
flew to Michigan because supplying the means to commit suicide is a
felony in Oregon.
   ``She is a remarkable woman,'' Kevorkian said. ``She was a
housewife who traveled extensively. She taught English part-time.
She played the piano. But the disease took away her ability to read
music. She couldn't even spell any more.''
   Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible degeneration of the brain
cells that can lead to severe memory loss and dementia.
   ``She told me she wanted to take her life while she was still
clear in her mind and knew what she was doing,'' Kervorkian said.
   She contacted Kevorkian in October, he said. Kevorkian said he
persuaded her to try an experimental drug treatment in Seattle in an
attempt to put the disease into remission.
   ``At first, I was not going to let her use the device,''
Kevorkian said. ``But the Seattle treatment didn't work. She told me
she had pills and she was going to do it (commit suicide) anyway.''
   Neither the husband nor the family friend wanted to be near when
the woman committed suicide, so they flew back to Oregon earlier
Monday, he said.
   The device involves hooking a person to an intravenous saline
solution. The person can press a button that stops the saline
solution and injects the drug thiopental, which causes
unconsciousness.
   Within a minute, potassium chloride is injected automatically, at
a dosage high enough to stop the heart and cause death within
minutes.
   Jim Baughman, chief of the Wayne County prosecutor's appellate
division, said last fall that helping someone die with the device
wouldn't be a crime under Michigan law because the patient, not the
doctor, would inject the drugs.
   Baughman said his opinion was based on a 1982 Michigan Court of
Appeals decision in which it overruled a lower court conviction of a
man who gave a gun to a friend, knowing the friend was going to
commit suicide.
   ``If you actually take part in the act, that's criminal,''
Baughman said. ``If you provide the means to do it, that's not.''

   Dismayed Nazi hunters today denounced defeat in the
House of Lords of a government bill that would have allowed
prosecutions of suspected war criminals. They said some of
``Hitler's worst henchmen'' live in Britain.
   The 207-74 vote by the unelected upper chamber to throw out a
measure that had been overwhelmingly adopted by the elected House of
Commons also set off a constitutional conflict.
   The vote just after midnight, following nine hours of emotional
debate, left Britain the only one of the World War II Allies without
laws to prosecute suspected war criminals.
   Canada and Australia have changed their laws to allow trials, and
the United States has deported suspects for trial.
   The Simon Wiesenthal Center, which submitted a list of suspects
to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government in 1986, said it
was ``deeply upset.''
   ``I think it is unthinkable that this country, which suffered so
much at the hands of the Nazis, continues to give a haven to some of
Hitler's worst henchmen,'' said Ephraim Zuroff, head of the Israeli
section of the Los Angeles-based Wiesenthal Center.
   Zuroff, in London for the debate, said he will submit more names
of British-resident suspects to the government this week.
   The Lords' action was a rare break with the popularly elected
House of Commons.
   The Lords' powers are limited to delaying bills for a year, and
the government now must decide whether to reintroduce the bill in
the autumn and force it through the Lords under a rarely used
parliamentary rule.
   Traditionally, the Lords only revise clauses, and never rejects
outright legislation passed by the House of Commons. The Commons
passed the bill by a 270-60 majority in December.
   The vote followed an inquiry by a government-appointed commission
that said there was enough evidence to prosecute three suspects for
murder and investigate another 124. The suspects allegedly helped
round up and murder thousands of Jews in Nazi-occupied Soviet
republics.
   ``I am not only dismayed, I am disgusted,'' said Lord Cocks, a
member of the opposition Labor Party. ``With all the problems facing
this country, the House of Lords has gratuitously stirred up this
constitutional issue of the Lords vs. the Commons. It is wrong and
unnecessary.''
   The Lords, a mostly elderly body of hereditary peers, judges,
bishops and politicians given lifetime titles, argued that it was
wrong to make retroactive laws, that fair trials would be impossible
because of the age of witnesses and that the legislation would lead
to ``show trials.''
   The archbishops of the Church of England and Methodist leader
Lord Soper, who sit in the upper chamber, all voted against
prosecutions. Soper said Christian charity meant letting ``bygones
be bygones.''
   Some Lords cautioned against stirring anti-Semitic prejudice by
prosecuting old Nazis. But others said defeating the bill was the
wrong message to send to Europe at a time of renewed anti-Semitism.
   Concentration camp survivor Lord Kagan, 75, rejected arguments
that witnesses' memories could be faulty.
   ``Anybody who was in a concentration camp, he knew his guard's
face, he knew every muscle ... it was etched into his mind, into his
memory and into his heart,'' said Kagan.
   Government ministers battled to save the bill from defeat.
   ``Murder is murder in any language, in any country,'' said Earl
Ferrers, a hereditary peer and Home Office minister in Mrs.
Thatcher's government.
   ``Other countries who were faced with the evidence that now
confronts us have changed their law,'' he said. ``It would be
unfortunate if the United Kingdom with all its international
standing for justice and integrity should ... be tainted with the
slur of being a haven for criminals.''
   The bill was designed to become law by July, partly because of
the age of three prime suspects and the age of witnesses.
   Opponents of the bill included peers whose World War II units
were the first British troops to enter the Belsen concentration camp
as the Nazis were pushed back in 1945.
   Legislators in the Commons, most of whom were children or not
born during the war, have accepted overwhelmingly a
government-appointed commission's recommendation to prosecute
suspected war criminals.
   Britain's chief rabbi, Lord Jakobovits, a refugee from Nazi
Germany who was nominated for the Lords by Mrs. Thatcher in 1981,
said a no vote would give the ``wrong signal'' amid renewed signs of
anti-Semitism in Europe.
   ``Some opponents of this bill ... are among the staunchest
friends of the Jewish people,'' declared Jakobovits, 69. ``But I
have got to add that so were some of those who were appeasers of the
Nazis in the 1930s.''

<TEXT>
   Former President Ford says he believes
President Bush is being firm enough with Mikhail Gorbachev about
Lithuania for now, but he predicts the issue will continue to
complicate U.S.-Soviet relations.
   In an appearance Monday at the National Press Club, Ford also
said he believed Bush and the Soviet president established a warm
and useful relationship during their summit in Washington, which
ended Sunday.
   Before the summit, Bush said he would ask Congress to approve a
liberalized trade agreement with the Soviets only if Moscow dropped
restrictions on emigration and ended its partial economic blockade
of Lithuania.
   After meeting with Gorbachev, however, he announced such an
agreement and said it was linked only to emigration. He made no
mention of the embargo on Lithuania, which Gorbachev imposed in
retaliation for the Soviet republic's declaration of independence.
   The Soviet legislature today postponed until at least September
adoption of a new emigration law that the United States says must be
passed before Washington will give Moscow preferential trade status.
   Ford was asked whether he would have dealt more firmly with
Gorbachev on the Lithuanian question.
   The former president said he had great admiration for the people
of Lithuania and the other Baltic republics, noting that about
10,000 Latvians emigrated after World War II to the Michigan
congressional district that he represented before becoming vice
president and then president.
   ``So I start out with a sympathy for their desire to regain their
independence,'' Ford said. ``At the same time, we have to have a
reasonable and balanced approach in the overall global context of
what this issue might be. So for the time at least I am going to
take the point of view that President Bush is handling it properly.''
   He said members of Congress ``very likely'' would try to block
the trade agreement, but he did not know whether they would succeed.
   ``The problem of the Baltic nations is going to be a very
difficult one for Mr. Gorbachev to solve, and it will be a
continuing problem between the government of the United States and
the Soviet Union,'' Ford said.

   The Covenant House program for runaway youths has
reduced its budget and laid off 111 employees in anticipation of a
loss of income because of the controversy surrounding its founder.
   The Rev. Bruce Ritter resigned earlier this year amid allegations
he had sexual relations with shelter residents and lent charity
funds to two former board members. He has denied wrongdoing.
   ``We haven't had a severe drop-off in funding yet, but we're
monitoring the money situation closely,'' George Wirt, a Covenant
spokesman, said Monday.
   Private donations have fallen and risen ``like a roller coaster''
since the controversy erupted late last year, according to Wirt.
   The Covenant House corporate board cut its budget for the next
fiscal year, beginning July 1, to $72 million from $86 million last
year, according to Wirt.
   The organization also plans to shut down two centers in Manhattan
and consolidate them at its main shelter, Wirt said.
   In addition to the 111 layoffs out of the staff of 420, 64
vacancies will not be filled in New York, he said. Covenant House
provides shelter for 25,000 youths in the United States, Canada and
Central America.

   Jeff Jarrett, whose church's pews are
stacked with clothes for tornado victims, was relieved to hear that
federal disaster money was coming to Petersburg.
   ``That's great news,'' Jarrett said after President Bush declared
a federal disaster area Monday in 19 southern Indiana counties hit
by flooding, tornadoes or both.
   The Petersburg Church of Christ was a clearinghouse for clothing,
blankets and batteries Monday night. At least half of the homes were
still without power, and temperatures dipped into the 40s.
   ``I would say right now as far as their financial needs, they're
just beginning to find out,'' Jarrett said. ``Most of them feel
lucky just to be digging out their possessions.''
   The American Red Cross said 384 Petersburg homes were damaged or
destroyed by tornadoes Saturday night. Six people in the area were
killed.
   The disaster designation makes residents eligible for
low-interest loans and other federal assistance.
   In addition, the Red Cross planned to begin distributing vouchers
today for food, clothing, shelter and medical expenses.
   ``Sometimes the problem is convincing people to take the money,''
Red Cross spokesman Steve Small said. ``They're not going on the
dole; it's a gift from the American people to the American people
when they need it.''
   The tornadoes, which killed eight people, hit Petersburg and
Bedford in southern Indiana the hardest. Two more people in Indiana
died Sunday in a second wave of storms that spawned one tornado.
   The weekend storms also were blamed for two deaths in Wisconsin
and one each in Illinois and Missouri. Tornadoes also were reported
in Minnesota, Kentucky and Michigan.
   Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh said at a news conference Monday that the
``magnitude of this disaster is almost impossible to comprehend,''
adding that there was hundreds of millions of dollars of damage.
   ``My message today to the citizens of our state is we have
suffered some severe damage, we mourn our losses, but we're not
ready to give up,'' Bayh said.
   Residents and business owners may be eligible for temporary
housing, up to $10,500 in grants, low-cost loans to cover uninsured
property losses and other programs. State and local governments may
be eligible for money to repair or replace damaged public facilities.
   The American Red Cross estimated that more than 800 homes were
damaged in Indiana, including 240 that were destroyed. In Petersburg
alone, 114 homes were destroyed and 270 sustained damage.
   In Kentucky, 47 homes were damaged and a spokesman for the state
Department of Disaster and Emergency Services said storm destruction
could total as much as $5 million statewide.
   In Ohio, at least 1,600 homes and businesses in three
southwestern counties were damaged.
   All of Petersburg's 3,000 residents were without water Monday.
   About 5,000 homes and business in Petersburg and Bedford, which
also was heavily damaged, were still without electric service
Monday, said Pamela K. Chapman, a spokeswoman for PSI Energy. She
said power would be restored to most areas by today.
   For the third consecutive week, Petersburg residents were urged
to boil all drinking water once service was restored. The city lost
its fresh water supply two weeks ago when floodwater broke the main
water line.
   Meanwhile, Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson got a firsthand view
of some of the storm devastation in his state.
   On Monday, he flew over over two of the 10 counties he had
declared disaster areas and said: ``Since it was declared a state
disaster area, that will make it easier to become a federal disaster
area, and that will make federal money more available.''

<HEAD>Father Says He Wishes He Had Sought Medical Advice for Ailing Son</HEAD>

   A Christian Scientist on trial for his son's death
testified that he now wishes he had sought medical help for the
ailing 2{-year-old.
   David and Ginger Twitchell are accused of recklessly causing the
boy's death because they treated him with prayer, instead of
conventional medicine. Robyn died from a bowel obstruction in April
1986.
   ``If medical science could have saved my son, I wish I had turned
to it,'' Twitchell said Monday during his trial for manslaughter.
   Twitchell said that after hearing the previous weeks' testimony,
he now wishes he had sought medical care for Robyn.
   The couple has said they rely on spiritual healing to cure
physical ailments according to Christian Science principles.
   Defense attorneys have sought to show that Robyn's symptoms
resembled the flu. An autopsy showed the boy had a birth defect that
caused the obstruction.
   Prosecutor John Kiernan asked Twitchell about his assertion
during a network television broadcast two years ago that he still
did not wish he had called for medical treatment for his son's
condition.
   Twitchell said his conversations with medical professionals at
that time did not convince him that medicine could have saved his
son.
   But now, he indicated, he is of a different mind.
   ``My present state of mind is that if they had diagnosed it
properly, if we had gone to them early enough, if there were not
complications, they could have saved him,'' he testified.
   Today, if prayer did not seem to be working in a similar
circumstance, ``I would give medical science a chance to try their
hand,'' he said.
   Kiernan repeatedly questioned Twitchell about dental work he had
done. He indicated that Twitchell relied on medication by accepting
a painkiller during the procedure, but denied similar relief to
``his little child.''
   ``I did not refuse to provide it to him but I did not provide it
to him,'' Twitchell responded.
   He acknowledged that his reliance on a dentist was a failure of
spiritual healing and that ``Robyn's death was a failure of
spiritual healing.''
   Officials from the Christian Science Church, which is based in
Boston, contend the state of Massachusetts has put the religion
itself on trial.
   Prosecutors have denied that they are attacking the Christian
Science religion, but say they are trying to protect children from
parents who put their children at risk by relying solely on
spiritual healing.

<HEAD>Actor Jack Gilford Remembered for His Love of Work</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to CORRECT age to 81.</NOTE>

   Jack Gilford, who scratched his way back from a
blacklisted decade during the McCarthy era with commercials for
Crackerjack and potato chips, was remembered by friends as an
unselfish actor who loved to work.
   Gilford, whose 55-year career spanned vaudeville, Broadway,
television and movies, died Monday of stomach cancer at age 81.
   ``Jack Gilford was one of the most talented and dear actors that
I ever had the good fortune to work with,'' Jack Lemmon said. ``More
importantly, though, he had an innate sense of grace, style and
selflessness that was unflappable,'' he said.
   Gilford died at his Manhattan home, said Merle Debuskey, a family
friend and publicist. Gilford's wife of 41 years, actress-writer
Madeline Lee, was with him.
   To Gilford, work was everything.
   ``What else is there?'' he once said. ``My creed is this _ if you
can find something better than being wanted, call me any time of the
day or night, call me collect and tell me what it is. Because
whatever it is, it's very important.''
   Gilford's droopy face and distinctive, raspy voice were known to
generations.
   He had worked recently on television, sweeping salty-tongued
Sophia of the ``Golden Girls'' off her feet.
   To stage aficionados, Gilford was Hysterium, the slave who ends
up in drag in ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' or
Herr Shultz in ``Cabaret.'' He collected Tony nominations for both
roles.
   Television buffs may remember Gilford's dramatic appearance on
the 1960s series ``The Defenders,'' in which he played a man who
shoots a policeman, or as the pitchman in commercials for
Crackerjack and Lays potato chips.
   Gilford's work for Crackerjack earned him a Clio award and a
winged statuette, courtesy of the Cannes Film Festival.
   The commercials also helped Gilford rebuild his career after work
in front of cameras dried up during the McCarthy era. Gilford, like
other show-business people on the political left, was blacklisted
for a decade.
   ``One day the phone just stopped ringing and I didn't do TV or
films for 10 years,'' Gilford said. His wife and Zero Mostel, his
best friend who starred in ``Forum,'' also were blacklisted.
   ``It was a hard time and I don't like much to talk about it
now,'' Gilford once said, adding, ``I'm not ashamed of my feelings
at that time.''
   Gilford's death ``saddens me greatly,'' said actor Michael
Crawford, who also appeared in ``Forum.''
   ``It was a wonderful experience to watch him work with Zero. He
was a wonderful artist,'' Crawford said.
   Gilford was the quintessential garment manufacturer in the 1970s
movie ``Save the Tiger,'' which earned him an Academy Award
nomination for supporting actor. Lemmon starred in the film.
   Movie audiences also knew Gilford as the oldster who decided
against being rejuvenated by aliens in ``Cocoon'' and ``Cocoon II.''
   Born Jacob Gellman and raised in Brooklyn, Gilford liked to tell
people his career was financed by his mother's illegal liquor-making.
   ``She was the only woman in our part of Williamsburg who was
arrested three times for bootlegging,'' he said in a 1987 newspaper
interview.
   She urged him to quit his job in a cosmetics store and audition
at amateur nights. Soon he was plucked from obscurity by Milton
Berle. Gilford played second banana to the future Uncle Miltie for
2{ years before moving on.

   The town's president, two of his sons,
and a councilman were electrocuted when a flagpole they were taking
down touched a high-voltage line, state police said.
   The men were removing the flagpole Monday night for painting and
repairs when it touched a 7,200-volt power line. The pole was
outside the community center in this mountain town of 350 people, 75
miles south of Pittsburgh.
   Screams from the mother of one victim drew Kathy Lawson to the
scene.
   ``They were still on fire and I held onto his mother to keep her
back,'' Lawson said. ``The whole town was running over to them, but
nobody could get to them because the pole was right over them and
electricity was still running through it.''
   An emergency crew eventually shut off the power.
   Killed were Borough President Robert Friend, 59; his sons Randall
Friend, 23, and Robert Friend II, 22; and Councilman Keith Coppett,
35, said Trooper Richard Veil of the Uniontown barracks.
   Another of Friend's sons, Doug, 27, was injured. He was treated
at Uniontown Hospital and released, nursing supervisor Tammy Swoger
said today. A sixth man who was helping take down the flagpole was
not injured, Veil said.
   State police identified the victims using reports from witnesses.
   Fayette County Deputy Coroner Margie Riley said identifications
would be made through dental records because the bodies were so
badly burned.

<TEXT>
   The first meeting between a South
Korean and Soviet leader accelerated efforts toward full diplomatic
ties and was greeted in South Korea today as a turning point in the
nation's foreign relations.
   President Roh Tae-woo said that as a result of Monday's meeting
with Mikhail S. Gorbachev in San Francisco, ``normal bilateral
relations between our countries will be restored'' after 45 years.
   No dates were announced for establishing diplomatic relations,
but a Roh aide said it could be expected in the ``not-distant
future.''
   The South Korean newspaper Dong-a Ilbo said Roh agreed to send
Foreign Minister Choi Ho-joong to Moscow by July. It quoted
high-ranking officials as saying full diplomatic ties could be
established by September.
   ``We are convinced that the summit meeting has not only been a
turning point in relations between the two countries, but has also
been an epoch-making event which will see an end to the Cold War
legacy on the Korean peninsula and will pave the way for a peaceful
reunification between South and North Korea,'' said Lee Soo-jung, a
government spokesman traveling with Roh.
   Lee's statement was released in Seoul today.
   Roh's announcement was welcomed by most South Koreans, who want
to see an easing of hostilities with Communist North Korea. The
Koreas were divided in 1945, fought a bloody civil war in the early
1950s and remain bitter enemies.
   North Korea is a long-time ally of the Soviet Union.
   But not all South Koreans welcomed the improvement in
Seoul-Moscow ties.
   Scattered violent protests erupted at several campuses, where
radical students denounced Roh's diplomatic overtures to Communist
nations.
   In southern Kwangju, about 2,000 militant students yelling
anti-government slogans fought riot police with firebombs and rocks,
said Yonhap, the national news agency.
   In Seoul, several hundred students throwing firebombs and rocks
clashed with police firing tear gas outside Korea University and
Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.
   Wall posters at two schools denounced the talks and warned Moscow
``your diplomats arriving in Seoul will be driven out by the Korean
people.''
   Radical students say Roh wants to establish relations with Moscow
to delay unification of the peninsula. They say Moscow's recognition
of the Seoul government will perpetuate the division.
   In a statement issued today, a major alliance of dissident groups
said Roh's diplomacy was subservient to the superpowers.
   Afternoon newspapers devoted their entire front sections to the
talks. Both KBS and its rival Munwha Broadcasting Co. devoted five
hours of live satellite and local coverage to Roh's visit in San
Francisco.
   Roh has been pursuing a policy of establishing ties with current
and former Communist countries to isolate North Korea. South Korea
now has relations with all countries in East Europe except Albania
and East Germany. The government says it is working toward ties with
China and East Germany.
   South Korea also hopes diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union and
China, the two largest Communist nations, will enhance its
international prestige and gain acceptance for Seoul as an Asian and
world power.
   South Korea, the 10th-largest trading country in the world, also
hopes to expand economic and trade relations with Moscow.
   But some South Koreans expressed disappointment that the talks
apparently did not result in concrete agreements on pursuing peace
on the divided Korean peninsula or a timetable for normalizing
relations with Moscow.
   The Party for Peace and Democracy, the main opposition party,
welcomed the prospect of normalizing Soviet-South Korean relations,
but criticized Roh for taking a low profile during the talks.
   ``The fact that the two met face to face is very important to
us,'' said Dr. Rhee Sang-woo, a government adviser and dean at
Seoul's Sogang University. ``Regardless of the subjects discussed,
the fact they met is most important.''
   North Korea has criticized the Roh-Gorbachev meeting.
   The border between the Communist North and capitalist South is
the most heavily fortified in the world. More than 1 million armed
soldiers are on either side behind concrete bunkers and barbed wire.
   Dissidents have called for independent talks between the Koreas,
saying both the Soviet Union and the United States were responsible
for the division of the peninsula at the end of World War II.

   A summit of 35 East and West bloc
nations will be held in Paris in December to discuss ``the
reconciliation of Europe,'' French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas
said today.
   The summit proposal was the first item of business at a human
rights meeting of the 35-nation Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe, esablished by the 1975 Helsinki accords.
   A preparatory committee will meet in Vienna July 10 to set the
agenda for the summit, which Dumas suggested for Dec. 19-21.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze reported on the
results of the weekend U.S.-Soviet summit in Washington and
announced that the Soviet Union would cut its short-range nuclear
arsenal in central Europe by year's end.
   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker was to address the meeting
Wednesday.
   Albania was granted observer status at the four-week human rights
talks. The hard-line Communist country has begun to seek greater
contacts following years of isolation.
   Lithuania, which also had sought permission to attend the
meeting, ``was politely turned down,'' said a statement from the
Lithuanian World Community.
   Max Kampelman, head of the U.S. delegation, said the group would
consider establishing a body to mediate disputes involving ethnic
minorities.
   ``As the East-West conflict reduces in importance and
confrontations, we are seeing some of the old pre-World War II
tensions developing again,'' Kampelman said in an interview.
   ``One of the subjects we will discuss is whether the CSCE process
can provide some mediation role here,'' he said.
   Kampelman, a veteran diplomat and arms negotiator, said one such
conflict could be the alleged discrimination by ethnic Hungarians
living in Romania. They say they are unable to develop their own
culture.
   ``Frankly, there is no other mechanism'' to deal with minority
questions, he said. ``We're going to see if we can evolve one.''
   The 15-year-old international organization has no enforcement
power, and its mediation in any dispute could by applied only
voluntarily, he said.
   Kampelman said he expected the Copenhagen meeting to endorse the
principles of free elections and rule of law, meaning ``that those
who govern also are subject to the law and not arbitrariness.''
   The Conference on Security and Cooperation is comprised of the
United States, Canada and all European countries except Albania,
which now wants to join. It was established by the Helsinki accords,
which eased security tensions and set standards for cooperation and
human rights.
   The Copenhagen conference was the second of three planned on
human rights. The first, in Paris last June, failed to approve a
final document because of Romanian opposition. The third is
scheduled for Moscow next year.

   President Bush is likely to block new offshore
oil activity along the California and Florida coasts while calling
for environmental impact studies, administration officials say.
   The long-pending decision would ease Republican election-year
concerns in the environmentally conscious states if Bush's decision
follows the officials' expectations.
   However, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said today
that Bush ``has not decided this issue yet'' and he ruled out the
possibility of an announcement this week.
   The option Bush is said to be leaning to would bar new drilling
off Florida until the year 2002, off Northern California until 1997
and off Southern California until at least 1992, according to
officials who spoke Monday on condition of anonymity.
   The dates reflect the years when the government's five-year
leasing plans are up for review. The current one expires in 1992.
   The officials cautioned that the president still could change his
apparent course and open the way for some drilling, but they said
that appeared unlikely.
   A task force Bush appointed last year to study effects of
potential drilling in the three areas concluded that there was not
enough information to go ahead with the new offshore activity.
   The Florida congressional delegation has unanimously urged Bush
to bar offshore drilling, as has Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, who
is seeking re-election to a second term.
   Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, seeking the governorship of
California, wants a total ban on new oil activity along the coast
and opposed the Reagan administration's efforts to expand leasing
areas.
   A postponement would fall short of the decision sought by
environmentalists, who contend there have been enough studies to
show the environmental harm and warrant a permanent ban in both
states.
   ``The public has moved far beyond where delays are going to
satisfy people. It's time to move to protect some of these areas
permanently,'' said Lisa Speer, an attorney for the Natural
Resources Defense Council.
   The broadest set of options initially drawn by the president's
staff ranged from opening the study areas for leasing and drilling
to permanently banning such activity.
   Bush has expressed the most interest in options involving
postponement of new oil activity pending new studies and more
specific options were developed accordingly, the officials said.
   The president named a task force last year, headed by Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan, to work with the National Academy of
Sciences in studying the environmental impact of opening the three
areas to oil leasing.
   The regions under consideration are: a 6.7-million acre section
of ocean off Southern California, 1.2 million acres off Northern
California and 13 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico near the
Florida Everglades.
   A policy initiated by former President Reagan's interior
secretary, James Watt, opened the entire 1.4-billion-acre Outer
Continental Shelf. But leasing has been blocked over the years by
congressionally imposed moratoriums.
   In Florida, the government sold 73 leases in the affected area in
the early 1980s for $108 million. The cost of buying the leases back
could be closer to $200 million, Interior Department officials say.
   Southern California is the only region of the country other than
the Gulf of Mexico where offshore oil development is under way; 22
oil platforms are operating.
   The Interior Department's current five-year program had
anticipated new lease sales last September, but they were put off
pending Bush's decision.
   The northern California leases, about 90 miles north of San
Francisco and off Eureka, had been scheduled for sale early last
year, but the sale was postponed.

   Dianne Feinstein and John Van de Kamp sweat out the voters'
verdict today in California's Democratic gubernatorial primary, the
featured contest on a nine-state election day that stretched from
New Jersey to New Mexico.
   North Carolina's Democrats were picking an opponent to face
conservative Republican Sen. Jesse Helms in the fall. The choice in
a runoff primary was between prosecutor Mike Easley and former
Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt, bidding to become the first black
nominated for statewide office in his state.
   ``I'm ready to get into this fight'' with Helms, Gantt said as he
cast his own ballot today. ``I'm ready to get it on with him.''
   In all, five states had primaries for governor on the ballot. The
tally of Senate races ran to eight states. Dozens of members of
Congress sought nomination for new term, and waited to learn the
names of their opponents for the November election.
   In one statewide referendum of note, Californians were deciding
whether to accept a doubling in the statewide gasoline tax, from
nine cents a gallon to 18 cents over five years. The first year's
increase would be a nickel.
   Seven incumbent senators were on the ballot, facing token
opposition at most.
   They included Democrats Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Howell Heflin
of Alabama, Max Baucus of Montana and Tom Harkin of Iowa; and
Republicans Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Pete Domenici of New Mexico
and Larry Pressler of South Dakota. Helms already has secured the
GOP nomination in North Carolina.
   Cochran was assured of a new term, since no Democrat filed
candidate's papers for the primary.
   The statehouse races were in Iowa, New Mexico, South Dakota,
Alabama and California, where Republican Gov. George Deukmejian is
retiring after two terms.
   GOP Sen. Pete Wilson and his $3.5 million war chest awaited the
winner of the contest between Feinstein, the former San Francisco
mayor, and Van de Kamp, California's attorney general.
   The Democratic race was nothing if not expensive, as both
Feinstein and Van de Kamp raised more than $6 million for their
candidacies.
   Both candidates underscored their support for abortion rights in
the final hours of their campaign.
   Feinstein campaigned to the end as tough on crime, trying to
seize an issue that seemed more likely to belong to her opponent,
the attorney general.
   She ran a late-campaign commercial on television criticizing Van
de Kamp for declining to prosecute a suspect in the Hillside
Strangler case in which 10 people were killed. Van de Kamp was the
Los Angeles district attorney at the time, and the suspect, Angelo
Buono, was later convicted of murder after the state attorney
general stepped into the case.
   Van de Kamp called the criticism ``baloney.''
   New Mexico had four-way races in both gubernatorial primaries.
   Republican Govs. Guy Hunt of Alabama, George Mickelson of South
Dakota and Terry Branstad of Iowa were seeking new terms.
   Iowa's Democratic primary race was being watched for any
significance on the national debate over abortion. Democrats there
chose among three contenders _ abortion-rights supporters Don
Avenson and John Chrystal and a third contender who opposes
abortion, state Attorney General Tom Miller.
   California's statehouse race was the one drawing the most
national attention.
   The state is expected to gain at least five seats in the
congressional redistricting based on the 1990 census. Republicans
are hopeful that Wilson can gain the governor's chair, and give them
a check against the heavily Democratic legislature when it comes
time to draw legislative district boundaries.
   The race for the Democratic nomination for governor of Alabama
was headed for a runoff, with none of the five contenders likely to
get the 50 percent needed to win outright in the first round. The
top two finishers would be on the ballot for a runoff June 26 to
decide the challenger to Republican Gov. Guy Hunt.
   In the Senate contests, Republican Rep. Tom Tauke was on the Iowa
primary ballot to take on Harkin in the fall in what is expected to
be one of the nation's hottest races.
   Alabama's Heflin and South Dakota's Pressler also are under
challenge from potentially strong opponents. Heflin's foe in
November will be Republican Bill Cabannis and Pressler will come up
against Democrat Ted Muenster.
   In the North Carolina Senate race, Helms is running commercials
attacking both Democrats on the runoff primary ballot.
   Gantt led a six-candidate field in the May 8 primary but failed
to reach the 40 percent needed to avoid a runoff.
   Only one House incumbent has been defeated for renomination this
year, Republican Donald ``Buz'' Lukens of Ohio. He was convicted of
contributing to the unruliness of a minor after being accused of
having sex with her.
   A few other House members have had closer-than-expected primary
races, though, and such races are closely watched for signs of voter
dissatisfaction over a large congressional pay raise approved late
last year.
   In one House race, former professional football player Phil
McConkey in New Jersey is running for a House seat as an
anti-abortion Republican.

   The Soviet legislature today tentatively postponed
until September adoption of a new emigration law that Washington
says is necessary before it will give Moscow preferential trade
status.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush signed a trade
agreement at the Washington summit, but Bush said he won't press the
U.S. Congress to grant the Soviet Union most-favored-nation trading
status until the emigration legislation is passed.
   Soviet restrictions on emigration have for decades been a major
impediment to improved U.S.-Soviet relations. Millions of dollars of
trade and the fate of Soviets hoping to emigrate are riding on
approval of the law.
   The Soviet legislature, by acclamation, adopted a new agenda that
dropped consideration of the emigration law before the body adjourns
June 14 for the summer.
   Fyodor Burlatsky, a member of the legislature's International
Affairs committee, had said in a television interview recently the
law would be considered May 31.
   The decision drew immediate criticism from lawmakers who said it
opened the Soviet Union to accusations of duplicity.
   ``We will turn out to be cheats. We won't be trusted. They will
say, `Well, they made a promise and again the Soviet Union is
deceiving,''' Nikolai Medvedev, a Supreme Soviet member from
Lithuania, told the session.
   In response, Supreme Soviet Chairman Anatoly Lukyanov held out
the possibility that the decision would be reviewed and the law
taken up earlier.
   ``The president will arrive. We will look it over and if there is
a possibility, we will include this issue. We will look it over with
the president,'' Lukyanov said.
   It was not clear whether the postponement was made with
Gorbachev's approval, whether it was a mistake, or whether other
Kremlin leaders engineered the decision. It could be an
embarrassment to Gorbachev, who was returning from the summit today.
   Lukyanov is a close ally of Gorbachev, carrying out the leader's
will in the legislature, and he did not explain why he allowed what
appeared to be such a radical shift so soon after the Soviet
commitment in Washington to enact the legislation.
   Medvedev said Soviet officials had promised U.S. senators during
the just-completed summit that the new emigration bill would be
approved during the current Supreme Soviet session.
   The proposed legislation, which was given preliminary approval in
November, would allow emigration of virtually anyone who has entry
permission from another country and no outstanding alimony
obligations, criminal charges or recent knowledge of state secrets.

   Congressional leaders told President Bush today
that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev must lighten up on
Lithuania if he expects Congress to go along with trade benefits to
Moscow.
   ``Call it linkage or call it reality,'' Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan., said after Bush briefed top House and Senate
leaders on his private conversations with Gorbachev during the
summit.
   Lawmakers said Bush told them he had received no assurances from
Gorbachev, even in private, that the Soviet Union would lift its
economic boycott of the rebellious Baltic state.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Bush ``made it very
clear'' that he had presented a strong case to Gorbachev for easing
up in Lithuania.
   ``When the president sends us the trade agreement ... there will
be many in Congress who will want to see some progress on Lithuania
before approving it,'' Foley said. ``I asked the president if he
thought President Gorbachev understood there might be such reaction
from Congress; he said he did.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that, despite the
lack of a commitment from Gorbachev on Lithuania, ``the president is
persuaded that he (Gorbachev) wants to resolve the issue.''
   At the same time, the president is mindful of congressional
sentiment against granting the benefits to Moscow in absence of
progress on Lithuania.
   ``The only linkage is on the emigration reform law, but we will
never dismiss our concerns about Lithuania,'' Fitzwater said.
   Meanwhile, Fitzwater said that Bush continued the process of
conferring with allied leaders that he began on Sunday, calling
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu Monday night and French
President Francois Mitterrand this morning.
   The spokesman said Gorbachev's aircraft, as it cleared U.S. air
space at 1:39 a.m. EDT today, beamed a message to the White House
hailing the fruits of the summit and relaying the Soviet leader's
``sincere gratitude.''
   ``I'm not going to assess whether his pressing (Gorbachev) was
adequate or not,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine. ``He said he made the case.''
   But, the Senate leader said, nothing the president said made him
feel any more optimistic that a Lithuanian settlement was near.
   Dole said Bush told lawmakers at the 45-minute session that ``he
felt comfortable with Gorbachev, that they could speak with complete
candor and without rancor.''
   After a strong lobbying campaign from Gorbachev, Bush signed a
trade agreement with the Soviet leader last Friday without a return
commitment on Lithuania.
   However, Bush said he would not send the agreement _ which would
open the way for granting Moscow most-favored-nation trade status _
to Congress until the Soviet legislature passes a liberalized
emigration law.
   The Soviet legislature today postponed until at least September
adoption of such a law.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who flew to California with
Gorbachev on Sunday, said he had a chance to have a ``relaxed,
intimate'' conversation with the Soviet leader on Lithuania and
other subjects.
   He said he told Gorbachev that use of violence to block
Lithuanian independence would wreck Moscow's chances of getting
most-favored-nation trade status. It could also torpedo hopes of
getting a long-range nuclear weapons treaty this year, Cranston said
he told Gorbachev.
   ``He indicated very clearly that (violence in Lithuania) is not
going to occur,'' Cranston said. ``I thought that was reassuring.''
   In addition to congressional skepticism over the Soviet trade
pact, the administration also faces broad opposition for Bush's
recent decision renewing trade benefits to China.
   China flared as an issue before lawmakers left the capital on May
24 for the Memorial Day holiday. Bush announced then that he would
extend for one year the most-favored-nation trade status that grants
China lower tariffs on goods exported to the United States.
   Mitchell, who opposes the trade benefits because of China's human
rights practices, said he would meet with other lawmakers this week
to map out a course to try to reverse Bush's decision.
   In the legislative arena, meanwhile, the Senate is taking up a
wide-ranging crime-fighting bill. More than 250 amendments were
stacked up when Congress recessed, and the Democratic leadership
will seek a vote to curtail debate.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
urged his colleagues to curb the debate, saying ``this legislation
should not be killed by delay.''
   Amid this jockeying, former White House Press Secretary James
Brady, felled by John Hinckley Jr.'s March 1981 assault on President
Reagan and now a gun-control lobbyist, announced a ``Brady Bill
Blitz.''
   Brady's campaign seeks support for a provision requiring a
seven-day cooling-off period for the purchase of handguns. The
provision is designed to give police more time to conduct a record
check of would-be handgun buyers.
   House members were expected by Wednesday to try to override
Bush's veto of a bill authorizing $2 billion for Amtrak. The
president objected to one provision in that measure that would
expand federal oversight of railroad acquisitions in a way he said
would be ``a step backward for the entire rail industry.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that top elected
officials in the nation's most populous county systematically
discriminated against Hispanic voters to protect their own positions
in office.
   The plaintiffs called Monday's ruling a landmark civil rights
decision that will end more than a century of white domination of
politics in the county of 8.7 million people. An estimated 35
percent are Hispanic, but no member of any minority group has been
elected to the Board of Supervisors since 1875.
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge David Kenyon charged that Los
Angeles County's five-member board conspired to ``protect their
incumbencies and that of their allies'' when they redrew the
county's five voting districts in 1981.
   The judge said the redistricting violated the 1965 federal Voting
Rights Act and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to
the Constitution.
   The decision immediately throws the results of today's balloting
in two supervisorial districts into question. Plaintiffs urged that
the results be thrown out, and Kenyon said he would hold a hearing
Thursday to determine how the election results should be handled.
   ``For 115 years, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has
been an exclusive male, all-white club,'' said Marc Rosenbaum, an
attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of
Southern California, which was one of the plaintiffs. ``Today that
club membership is open to everyone.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh called the ruling a ``victory
against discrimination.'' The Justice Department had joined in the
suit.
   Representatives of the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund, another plaintiff, said they would demand that
county officials immediately redraw boundaries and create a largely
Hispanic district.
   ``We want a remedy now. We want a remedy that encompasses a fair
opportunity for our community to represent itself and to elect
representatives who will represent its interests,'' said Antonia
Hernandez, president and general counsel for the legal fund.
   Disputing the county's claims that creating a Hispanic-majority
district was impossible, Kenyon found that the Hispanic community
was ``large and geographically compact such that a five-district
plan can be drawn in which Hispanics comprise a majority of the
citizen voting-age population in one of the five districts.''
   Kenyon also recommended expansion of the board, saying the
districts are too large for one person to represent constituents
adequately.
   Supervisor Kenneth Hahn said he will introduce a motion at
Tuesday's meeting to expand the board to seven members. Such
proposals have been introduced before and would be subject to voter
approval.
   Pete Schabarum, a supervisor who decided not to seek reelection,
said the timing of Kenyon's ruling confused elections.
   ``I continue to believe that district lines should not be based
on ethnic factors,'' he added.
   Supervisor Michael Antonovich predicted the county would appeal.
County Counsel DeWitt Clinton would not comment on that possibility.
   The lawsuit, filed in August 1988, charged that the supervisors
deliberately spread the county's Hispanic population across several
districts when they redrew voting boundaries following the 1980
federal census.
   ``The explosive and continuous growth of the Los Angeles County
Hispanic community was evident at the time of the adoption of the
1981 redistricting plan, as was the steady decline of the county's
non-Hispanic white population,'' Kenyon wrote.
   The judge also concluded that Hispanics and non-Hispanics are
widely polarized when it comes to voting trends. Hispanics vote in
large numbers for fellow Hispanics, he said, and non-Hispanics
rarely vote for Hispanics.
   Attorneys for both sides have said they believe the judge will
allow the supervisors to redraw district boundaries, which he could
accept or reject.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today its forces
still held the country's main international airport, but diplomats
said rebels had overrun an American-managed rubber plantation on its
outskirts.
   The government acknowledged that airlines had halted flights to
Robertsfield International Airport, 35 miles from Monrovia, the
capital.
   Fearful residents fled the city and some government soldiers
abandoned key posts before the rebel advance.
   Off the West African nation's coast, a U.S. Navy flotilla
carrying 2,000 Marines stood ready to evacuate Americans and other
foreigners.
   President Samuel Doe remained at his presidential mansion in
Monrovia, shielded by about 1,000 Israeli-trained troops.
   Doe continued last-ditch efforts to end the 6-month-old civil
war, meeting with church leaders who have offered to act as
intermediaries.
   The Liberian president begged the United States and other
friendly countries ``to come to the aid of the Liberian people.''
   ``It is the wishes of the people of this country that America can
do something to stop the bloodshed,'' he said Monday.
   In Monrovia, people of the Mandingo and Krahn tribes loyal to Doe
_ himself a Krahn _ packed their belongings to flee the city. They
said they feared reprisals by rebels, who appeared to be closing in
on the city of about 400,000 residents.
   A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said 71 Americans, including
33 U.S. Embassy officials and their families, were evacuated Monday
on a chartered flight.
   The spokeswoman, Margaret Tutwiler, said in Washington that about
70 U.S. officials and 1,200 private American citizens remained in
Liberia.
   Today, diplomatic sources said rebels lobbed mortars and fired
machine guns as they poured into the American-managed rubber
plantation from across the Farmington River, the last natural
barrier between the rebels and Monrovia.
   The Bridgestone@Firestone Inc. rubber plantation adjoins
Robertsfield airport, diplomats said. About 15 or 20 government
soldiers remaining in the area returned rebel gunfire and then fled
toward the capital, sources said.
   Expatriates living in the area said there was a lot of shelling
and shooting between the plantation's riverside marina and the
Robertsfield Hotel, a three-minute walk from the airport.
   Although rebels were believed in the hotel, they made no effort
to capture the airport by midday today.
   They also occupied the management offices of Harbel, the town
owned by and operated by Bridgestone@Firestone, a subsidiary of the
Japanese company Bridgestone Corp. Rebels surrounded the
plantation's factory late Monday, stopping production, sources said.
   Trevor Hoskins, Bridgestone@Firestone's executive director of
public relations, said in Ohio that he talked Monday with the
plantation's managing director, ``who indicated ... everything was
quiet.''
   Hoskins said the plantation, which produces 100 million pounds of
rubber a year, covers 120,000 acres and includes 8,500 employees and
about 90,000 residents, mostly dependents.
   About 10,000 Liberians reportedly also moved onto plantation land
seeking refuge from the fighting. Family members of the plantation's
30 foreign staffers were evacuated two to three weeks ago.
   Rebels now control every major industrial concern in Liberia with
the possible exception of Bong Iron Ore Mine, which has been cut off
from the capital for days and is believed behind rebel lines.
   Airlines suspended flights to Robertsfield on Monday, effectively
closing the airport, after government troops fired on some of their
own men, believing them to be rebels.
   Diplomats and other sources who monitor military radio said that
after the shooting incident the government soldiers deserted the
checkpoint at Owensgrove, seven miles from the airport.
   Lt. Gen. Henry Dubar, Doe's military commander, admitted to
reporters that soldiers have been deserting their posts.
   ``The firing starts and they run away. They have to learn to stop
panicking,'' he said.
   Dubar said Monday that he hoped U.S. Marines would save Monrovia
from the rebel incursion.
   The U.S. State Department has accused rebel leader Charles Taylor
of receiving support from the radical North African nation of Libya,
but it also has said Marines will not intervene in support of Doe's
government.
   The rebels belong mostly to Liberia's Gio and Mano tribes and
invaded this nation of 2.5 million people from neighboring Ivory
Coast in December.
   About 2,000 Gios and Manos overflowed the compound of St. Peter's
Lutheran Church in Monrovia on Monday, where they were put under
protection of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   The rebel National Patriotic Front of Liberia has demanded Doe's
ouster, accusing his administration of corruption, economic
mismanagement and human rights abuses.
   Taylor was a close aide of Doe who headed the government agency
responsible for disbursing public funds. He fled the country after
Doe accused him of stealing $1 million from state coffers.
   Liberia, founded in 1822 by descendants of freed U.S. slaves, in
1847 became the first independent country in black Africa.

<TEXT>
   New Jersey's Supreme Court today declared
the state's 15-year-old system of financing public schools
unconstitutional because it hurts poorer, urban school districts.
   In the unanimous ruling, the court said the system left such
districts without the money and resources they need to give their
children the education that the state Constitution requires.
   ``The dilemma is that while we spend so much, there is absolutely
no question that we are failing to provide students in the poorer
urban districts with the kind of education that anyone can call
thorough and efficient,'' said the ruling, which was written by
Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz.
   The justices ordered lawmakers to begin fixing the problem by the
1991-92 school year. They said the state must assure that
disadvantaged districts spend about the same amount of money on each
child that is spent in richer, suburban districts.
   The court estimated it would have added about $440 million to the
$3.5 billion the state spent this year on public school aid to boost
funding in poor districts to the required levels.
   It said more money is particularly needed to meet the special
education needs and address the ``extreme disadvantages'' of
schoolchildren in poor communities.
   The court said it is not ordering equalized financing statewide.
Richer districts may choose to spend more on education, but the
state would be required to increase its aid to poorer districts if
the education in those school systems continues to be lacking.
   Lawmakers may devise any remedy they wish to correct the
disparities between wealthy and poor districts, but they may not do
it by forcing poor districts to raise property taxes, the court
ruled.
   Capping a decadelong legal battle, the justices repeatedly said
education financing cannot depend on the decisions of local schools
boards, and districts must be guaranteed a certain amount of money
every year.
   They also rejected the state's argument that money will not solve
the problem because many urban districts will simply mismanage and
waste the additional money.
   ``Money can make a difference if effectively used. It can provide
the students with an equal educational opportunity, a chance to
succeed. They are entitled to that chance, constitutionally
entitled,'' Wilentz wrote.
   New Jersey is among more than a dozen states where courts have
overturned school finance systems in recent years. The others are
Texas, Kentucky, Kansas, Wisconsin, California, Connecticut,
Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming, Arkansas and Montana.
   The latest conflict pitted the state against the Newark-based
Education Law Center. The center, which brought the lawsuit in 1981,
charged that New Jersey's $3.5 billion system discriminates against
poor districts because of its heavy reliance on property taxes.
   It contended that poor and urban districts are unable to raise
the money needed to provide a quality education and that the system
has allowed the gap between rich and poor districts to widen.
   The lawsuit was brought on behalf of 20 school-age children from
four New Jersey cities.
   After a similar legal battle fought throughout the 1970s, the
court ordered the Legislature to overhaul New Jersey's school
financing system, and lawmakers enacted a state income tax to pay
for more state education aid. In today's decision, the court found
that those reforms did not fully solve the problem.
   ``It's a victory for the schoolchildren of New Jersey, and the
courts' proposed remedy strives to do essentially, but in a more
modest way, what the governor has proposed himself,'' said Emma
Byrne, Gov. Jim Florio's spokeswoman.
   This latest ruling comes barely a week after Florio unveiled a
sweeping plan to overhaul the financing system.
   The governor wants to spend more state money on poor and
middle-income districts and reduce or eliminate aid to wealthier
school systems. He also wants to increase the income tax to provide
$1 billion more in state education aid.
   His plan establishes a minimum amount of money that districts
should spend on each child and determines how much the community
should be required to raise on its own, based on property wealth and
the wealth of a community's residents. The state would then provide
aid to make up the difference.
   In 1988, Administrative Law Judge Steven Lefelt ruled that the
financing system, as reformed in the 1970s, had failed because
poorer districts still fell behind wealthier districts.
   ``I do not believe in fixing what is not broken. However,
plaintiffs have proven the system is broken,'' he said in his ruling.
   He said more money may not be the only solution, but that it is a
start.
   Administrative law decisions are subject to review by state
officials. Education Commissioner Saul Cooperman rejected Lefelt's
findings, agreeing with the stand that then Gov. Thomas H. Kean's
administration took for the eight years it fought the lawsuit.

   A former mayor seeking to become North
Carolina's first black candidate for statewide office this century
faced a prosecutor in a Democratic runoff today for the right to
challenge Sen. Jesse Helms.
   Harvey Gantt, the 46-year-old former two-term mayor of Charlotte,
and 39-year-old Southport District Attorney Mike Easley avoided
attacks on each other during the campaign, instead saying their
priority is unseating the Republican Helms.
   Helms already has the GOP nomination and has been running
commercials attacking both Democrats.
   Gantt led a six-candidate field in the May 8 primary but failed
to reach the 40 percent needed to avoid a runoff between the top two
vote-getters.
   Easley, who received 30 percent to Gantt's 37 percent, demanded
the runoff despite Gantt's pleas to avoid one for the sake of
Democratic unity.
   After voting today in Charlotte, Gantt said: ``We'd like to carry
the West. And we'd like to carry the East, just to prove a point.''
   And he said he was eager to campaign against Helms. ``I`m ready
to get into this fight,'' he said. ``I'm ready to get it on with
him.''
   Easley, in Greenville, accused Helms of running far more ads
against him than against Gantt because the senator ``would rather
beat me in the last five days of the primary than face me for five
months in the election.''
   Beth Burrus, a spokeswoman for the Helms campaign, said that
there is no attempt to single out Easley and that Helms doesn't care
who wins the runoff.
   ``The polls show that it's going to be a very close race whoever
wins,'' she said. ``Both candidates lead Helms at this time.''

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union said today it plans
to withdraw 1,500 nuclear warheads and other tactical short-range
nuclear weapons from Central Europe by the end of the year.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who made the
announcment, said later that ``a very small amount, relatively,'' of
Soviet battlefield nuclear weapons will remain in Europe after the
withdrawals.
   ``This is going to be a very substantive amount,'' said
Shevardnadze, who is in Copenhagen for a 35-nation human rights
conference.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, also at the
conference, was cautious in his assssment of the announcement.
   ``We are still in the process of taking a look at it, analyzing
it,'' Baker said. He said the extent of the withdrawal was not
clear, nor whether the Soviets would destroy or simply remove the
weapons.
   Also, Baker said, it was not clear whether the arms Shevardnadze
spoke about would have been withdrawn in any event with the Soviet
troops currently being pulled out of Eastern Europe.
   Shevardnadze and Baker are meeting during the human rights
conference to push ahead with issues discussed during the Washington
summit between Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush.
   A central issue was the military future of a united Germany.
Europe and the United States want Germany as part of NATO but the
Soviet Union has balked at that idea.
   Speaking to the conference, Shevardnadze said a compromise could
be found in Soviet differences with Washington over Germany. He said
the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact would begin a ``transformation'' at its
next meeting and that NATO should do the same.
   ``This is the way, as we underlined in the past, that we can find
a compromise on the German issue,'' Shevardnadze said.
   Baker planned to assure Shevardnadze at a meeting tonight that
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would undertake a review of
its mission in light of easing East-West tensions.
   Bush and the heads of 15 other allied governments will meet in
London next month. The occasion is expected to mark a lowering of
NATO's military profile and a shift to more of a political profile.
   In his speech, Shevardnadze said the Soviet withdrawal of nuclear
weapons from central Europe would ease tensions and ``give more
latitude to man.''
   In addition to the nuclear warheads, he said his government will
withdraw 60 tactical missile launchers, more than 250 units of
atomic artillery and 3,200 atomic guns.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher welcomed the
announcement but said the Soviets enjoyed a superiority in
short-range missiles.
   ``The unilateral steps from the Soviet Union are going to make
negotiations on weapons easier. So we welcome it as a positive
step,'' Genscher said.
   In his efforts to gain Mosocw's suppport for NATO membership for
a united Germany, Baker carried with him to Copenhagen promises of
Western economic help and nuclear and territorial assurances.
   The possibility that West Germany would build houses for
returning Soviet troops was even included in a nine-point program.
   Baker told reporters on his flight from Washington that building
houses for troops withdrawn from Eastern and Central Europe ``fits
right in'' with the economic cooperation plan.
   His problem is selling the package to Shevardnadze. The Soviet
people harbor deep mistrust of Germany. Memories linger of World War
II in which the Nazis were routed from Russian soil after more than
20 million Soviets were killed.
   The foreign ministers are in Copenhagen for a European Security
Conference meeting on human rights.
   One of Baker's nine points is to expand the conference's
functions _ a long-held Soviet goal. The issue would be taken up by
the 35 member nations instead of just NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   Other key points include:
   _Assurances by the Germans they would not try to expand their
territory beyond the lands now controlled by West Germany and East
Germany.
   _A pledge by the new Germany not to acquire nuclear or chemical
weapons.
   _West German economic assistance for the Soviet Union.
   _Keeping Soviet troops in what is now East Germany for a
transitional period.
   _Keeping Western forces out of the territory.
   _An acceleration of negotiations to ban short-range nuclear
weapons in NATO and the Warsaw Pact
   _A revision of NATO military doctrine to reflect the easing of
East-West tensions.
   _A prompt second round of negotiations to make deeper cuts in
troops, tanks and other non-nuclear arms in Europe once the treaty
is concluded to reduce U.S. and Soviet manpower and weapons. This
would give Moscow a chance to seek limitations on the German army.

<HEAD>Census Count Nearing 90 Percent</HEAD>

   The 1990 Census has counted 87 percent of
American households, an official said Tuesday.
   Spokesman Ray Bancroft said the households had been counted in
the mail and door-to-door portions of the census, which is
continuing.
   Bancroft said the 90 percent level could be reached within a
week, but that ``the last 10 percent is the hardest to count.''
   People who mailed back their census forms in March were the
easiest to tally, and census workers have added to that total by
visiting the homes of those who didn't get forms in the mail or
failed to send them back.
   Now they are trying to count people who are reluctant to
cooperate with government officials, are away from home or are so
busy working that they are hard to find.
   The census, mandated every 10 years by the Constitution, is used
to redistribute seats in the House of Representatives and to divide
billions of dollars in federal aid among state and communities.
   Nearly 100 million forms were mailed in April.
   Bancroft said census maps of local communities were being sent to
about 39,000 local governments.
   By the end of August, each community will receive a count of the
number of housing units on each block and the total population of
the community. Local officials will have 15 days to report any
discrepancies between their counts and the census report.
   Meanwhile, processing is running well ahead of the rate set 10
years ago, Bancroft said.
   The 1980 census forms were kept at local offices until the area
count was complete, then shipped en masse to processing centers.
That meant computer processing didn't begin until August 1980.
   This year, forms are shipped to the seven processing centers as
they are collected. Microfilming and computer processing has already
begun.
   The first official census report is expected to be delivered to
President Bush on Dec. 31, listing the population of the country and
of each state as well as how many House seats to which each state is
entitled.

<HEAD>Professor Says He's Solved Mystery Of Sensational `Piltdown Man'
Fraud</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A City University professor says he has solved
the mystery of who was behind the 1912 ``Piltdown Man'' fraud, which
rocked the scientific community and provided fodder for a
decades-long whodunit.
   Dr. Frank Spencer, anthropology professor at Queens College, a
branch of City University, said in a telephone interview today that
the names of many prominent scientists, and even mystery maven Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle, had been mentioned as ``suspects'' through the
years.
   But his research, bolstered by that of Australian historian Ian
Langham, points the finger at Sir Arthur Keith, a well-respected
anatomist and conservator of the Hunterian Museum of the Royal
College of Surgeons.
   Spencer lays out the premise for the fraud in two new books to be
published this fall by Oxford University Press.
   Piltdown, a small village in England, made international news in
1912 when a skull and jaw of what became known as the ``Piltdown
Man'' were discovered in a gravel pit.
   ``It was sensational because it offered a completely different
view of evolution at the time,'' Spencer said.
   But in 1953 the discovery was completely debunked when it was
learned the remains were actually a human skull _ only a couple of
hundred years old _ with an orangutan's jaw fused to it.
   Still, the larger question remained _ who did it?
   Fingers immediately pointed to Charles Dawson, the country lawyer
who made the discovery, but the scientific community believed
someone else had to be involved.
   The names of scientist William J. Sollas, philosopher Pierre
Teilhard de Chardin and even Doyle, the Sherlock Holmes inventor who
lived nearby, kept coming up. But there was never any proof and
often no motive.
   ``The general feeling was that Piltdown was contrived to bring
somebody down, make someone in the scientific community look
silly,'' Spencer said, but that theory didn't work because ``if that
was the case, why didn't anyone ever do that?''
   Spencer said once he began looking at the evidence with the
viewpoint that Dawson's co-conspirator was someone who had something
to gain intellectually, not monetarily, he began to look at Keith.
   But his search for documents collided with the efforts of
Langham, a professor at the University of Sydney in Australia, and
Spencer said he ``backed off'' and allowed Langham to continue his
research alone.
   When Langham died in 1984 without concluding his research,
Spencer said, Langham's widow asked him to continue her husband's
work.
   He said the turning point was entries in Keith's diary ``in which
he indicates he had information about the site and events at
Piltdown ... which he wouldn't have had unless he was an inside
member of the group. This was really the crux of the thing.''
   Spencer said he and Langham also uncovered the fact that Keith, a
scientist who backed the theory of evolution that came out of
Piltdown, had met with Dawson a year before the discovery and again
just several months before.
   Though Spencer believes he and Langham have cracked the Piltdown
mystery, doubting Thomases still abound.
   Dr. Fred H. Smith, a paleontologist at the University of
Tennessee at Knoxville, told The New York Times that Spencer makes a
``good case'' but ``it's not ironclad.''
   Dr. William Ball, a former keeper of paleontology at the British
Museum, said until someone comes up with a signed confession,
questions surrounding Piltdown will remain.

<TEXT>
   The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) today
approved a statement of faith that mixes traditional Christian
beliefs with environmental concerns and images of God as both mother
and father.
   Commissioners stood and cheered after approving the statement _
the church's first since a 1983 merger of its northern and southern
branches following a 122-year split over slavery _ in a 499-to-25
vote.
   ``I think the statement of faith is a reflection of the church's
ability, even in the face of considerable diversity, that we are
still capable of forming a unified statement of Christian belief
that is consistent with our tradition,'' said the Rev. John Mulder,
president of Louisville Presbyterian Seminary.
   The statement must be sent to the denomination's 177
presbyteries. If two-thirds of them approve, it will come before the
1991 General Assembly for a final vote. It would then become the
11th statement in the 2.9 million-member denomination's Book of
Confessions.
   The statement upholds centuries-old church teachings that Jesus
Christ was both fully human and fully God, and that God raised Jesus
from the dead to offer eternal life.
   Reflecting more recent church developments, the statement also
declares that God calls women and men to all ministries of the
church, ``and makes everyone equally in God's image, male and
female, of every race and people, to live as one community.''
   The statement refers to God like a mother who will not forsake
her nursing child and like a father who runs to welcome the prodigal
home.
   It also says that human beings have exploited nature, ``and
threatened death to the planet entrusted to our care.''
   On Monday, the assembly, embroiled in a dispute over the
distribution of sexually explicit literature to a youth meeting by a
homosexual caucus, decided to take away semiofficial status from
both some of its severest liberal and conservative critics.
   Despite criticism that it was trying to reduce voices of dissent
within the church, commissioners voted to delete a part of the
church's Book of Order that gives groups such as Presbyterians for
Lesbian-Gay Concerns and Presbyterians Pro-Life the right to be
officially represented at church meetings.
   If a majority of the regional presbyteries agree, the
organizations will no longer ``be attached officially to the
church,'' said Marj Carpenter, news director of the church.
   The 202nd General Assembly also Monday decided to postpone until
1991 action on several issues related to abortion and the ordination
of homosexuals and voted to create a church office for the
environment.
   The issue of homosexuality heated up last summer when
Presbyterians for Lesbian-Gay Concerns detailed in brochures the
sexual practices of homosexuals to high school and college students
attending a church meeting at Purdue University. The brochures
discussed both oral and anal sex, and gave explicit instructions in
the use of condoms.
   In the resulting uproar, several regional church groups
petitioned the General Assemby to deny official church status to the
homosexual caucus.
   The assembly Committee on Worship and Diversity recommended that
all organizations with the same semiofficial status, including the
homosexual caucus and the Witherspoon Society and conservative
church critics such as the anti-abortion group and the Presbyterian
Lay Committee, no longer be accorded official representation within
the denomination.
   The Rev. Robert Butcher, committee moderator, said the sexually
explicit brochures may have served as a ``lightning rod'' for the
discussion. There were concerns within the church that the private
organizations were perceived as having official standing while
operating outside the governing bodies of the denomination.
   ``Many of these groups are, in fact, lobbying groups, but outside
the constitutional system of the church,'' he said.
   But in a minority report, committee member Nancy V. Rodman said
if the resolution passed, ``We are saying we no longer welcome the
dissent of our members.''
   The Rev. Robert Davidson of New York City said the church should
not be appearing to back away from defending the right to dissent at
a time when freedom of speech is breaking out all over the world.
   Faced with potentially volatile battles, the church voted to wait
until next year to take action on resolutions dealing with a variety
of issues on abortion and homosexuality. The postponed resolutions
included one calling for the church to withdraw from the Religious
Coalition for Abortion Rights and one that would have allowed local
church bodies to ordain practicing homosexuals.
   A Special Task Force on Human Sexuality is expected to report on
both homosexuality and abortion to the 1991 General Assembly. The
church supports legalized abortion, and opposes the ordination of
practicing homosexuals.
   In approving a 93-page document called ``Restoring Creation for
Ecology and Justice,'' commissioners voted to establish a
denominational office on environmental justice, and incorporate
environmental conceketing will continue into the Chapter 11 reorganization.
   ``We're not surprised about the filing because we've been
expecting it all along,'' said Gary H. Daughrity, executive board
member of Local 1313, Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions
in Dallas.
   ``A lot of us can't figure out why it took so long for Greyhound
to seek bankruptcy court protection.''
   One reason that Greyhound's financial woes worsened was that
fewer striking drivers crossed picket lines than company management
had anticipated, Daughrity said.
   The company has hired about 3,000 replacement drivers and claims
to have restored service to locations that provided 98 percent of
revenues last year.
   But the drop in ridership and the cost of fighting the sometimes
violent strike drained the company's cash, including a strike fund
estimated at more than $54 million.
   Greyhound blamed the strike for much of its $56 million
first-quarter loss. The company also has missed more than $17
million in interest, lease and principal payments, putting it in
default on many financial agreements.
   ``In the past few days, there has been a lot of pressure by
creditors'' who own buses and terminals and lease them to Greyhound,
said President Frank Schmieder.
   Under the lease agreements, those owners can repossess buses
immediately after a missed payment. Spokesman George Gravley said
the company was concerned about possible action by owners of leases
on 500 to 1,000 of the company's 3,800 buses.
   ``While most (creditors) have been cooperative, we were faced
with the threat of a `run on assets' that would have crippled our
ability to operate,'' Doyle said.
   Greyhound filed its petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Brownsville. The filing also includes five affiliated companies:
Eagle Bus Manufacturing Co., GLI Bus Operations Holding Co.,
BusLease Inc., Trailways Commuter Transit Inc. and GLI Food Services
Inc. Greyhound's parent, GLI Holding Co., was not included.
   Greyhound has reported scores of shootings, bomb threats and
incidents of vandalism since the strike began. A striking driver in
Redding, Calif., was killed on the second day of the walkout after
being crushed by a bus driven by a replacement.
   Talks stalled under the company's demand that a week pass without
violence first. The two sides did meet on May 5, but the union
balked at Greyhound's insistence on retaining its newly hired
drivers and changing from a mileage-based to an hourly wage scale.
   On May 7, Chairman Fred G. Currey said the strike had become
``irrelevant'' because the carrier had enough drivers to operate.
   Two weeks later, however, the company proposed repurchasing $225
million of its junk bonds at a steep discount to avert bankruptcy.
   Schmieder said negotiations are continuing on a debt buyback, but
``it will take longer now because the courts will have to approve
any financial restructuring.''
   The company's total debt stood at $384 million at the end of
March. The debt is the legacy of a $270 million leveraged buyout led
by Currey three years ago that took the company private. A few
months later, the group paid $80 million for Dallas-based Trailways
Lines Inc.

   An American F-86F jet fighter crashed off Okinawa on
Tuesday, but the pilot was rescued by a Japanese military
helicopter, defense officials said.
   A Japanese defense force official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, refused to identify the pilot but said he was not
injured. U.S. military officials could not immediately be reached
for comment.
   The official said the helicopter picked up the pilot about one
hour after the plane crashed in water 80 miles northwest of the U.S.
Kadena Air Base on Okinawa, where the plane was based.
   The official said the plane was used as a target in training for
U.S. military planes.
   Kyodo News Service quoted Lt. Col. R.W. Winkelmann, chief of
public affairs of the Okinawa-based 313rd Air Division, as saying
the plane developed engine trouble during a training exercise.
   It quoted Japanese defense force sources as saying the plane was
owned by Tracor Flight System Inc., a civilian company based in
California.

   A man with a dagger tried to attack
the chairman of a political party during a rally, but other people
stopped him and he was in police custody, a newspaper said Tuesday.
   The target of the attack was Josef Bartonick of the Czechoslovak
People's Party. The party is one of three that makes up the
Christian Democratic Union, which polls say is the second-strongest
political force in the country.
   Bartonick escaped unhurt after the incident Sunday in Cikhaj,
east of Prague.
   ``As I was speaking on stage, a young man armed with a dagger
tried to climb up toward me. Thanks to the fast action of the
organizers and participants in the rally the man was stopped and
handed over to the police,'' Bartonick was quoted by the daily
Lidova Demokracie as saying.
   The motive of the attempted attack was not known. The man was not
identified, but his age was given as 25.
   It was the second violent incident in the generally quiet
campaign for Friday's national elections. A bomb went off on
Prague's central Old Town Square on Saturday and injured 19 people.
Police have launched a probe into the explosion.

   Angolan government forces killed 98
U.S-backed UNITA rebels during recent fighting near the southeastern
town of Caiundo, the Angolan state news agency reported Tuesday.
   The ANGOP report, monitored in Lisbon from the Angolan capital of
Luanda, said seven rebels and six anti-tank misiles were captured
and seven government soldiers wounded during the clashes Friday.
   UNITA representatives contacted in the Portuguese capital refused
to comment on the ANGOP dispatch.
   Meanwhile, Lisbon's TSF radio station Tuesday cited unnamed
Angolan officials as saying 5,000 government troops had withdrawn
from the Caiundo area in southeastern Cuando Cubango province.
   According to the TSF report, Luanda decided to withdraw the
soldiers because UNITA had adopted a more flexible attitude toward
peace talks with the government.
   In December, the Angolan government launched one of the biggest
offensives of the 15-year civil war against rebel strongholds in
Cuando Cubango.
   Recently government troops have pulled back from some positions
captured in that advance.
   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _
has been fighting to force the Marxist government to share power
since the country gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   A cease-fire sealed by Presdient Jose Eduardo dos Santos and
rebel leader Jonas Savimbi in June 1988 broke down within weeks.
   Although peace talks restarted in April in Portugal, heavy
fighting has continued.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of cafe and restaurant owners in
Bordeaux are waging a boycott against Coca-Cola to protest what they
view as unfair competition from vending machines.
   Christian Sauvage, president of the main hotel and restaurant
owners' association in the region, said Tuesday the soft drink
company had flooded Bordeaux with about 850 vending machines as part
of a test marketing program.
   Sauvage said his association had accepted Coca-Cola's proposal to
place the vending machines inside business premises but objected
when machines also were placed in the streets.
   ``In the machines, a bottle costs five francs (90 cents),'' said
Sauvage. ``At our places, taking into account expenses, we sell it
at 10 to 15 francs. The young people aren't crazy _ they rush over
to the machines.''
   The boycott began two months ago in Bordeaux, France's
fifth-largest city, and now involves about 500 establishments,
Sauvage said.
   A spokesman for Coca-Cola, who declined to be identified, said
the company hoped to negotiate a resolution to the dispute. The
spokesman contended that the vending machines catered toward a
different clientele than the regular patrons of cafes.

annexation to the Soviet Union in 1921. Georgians vote for a new
Supreme Soviet legislature on June 17, and independence will be a
key campaign issue. The opposition groups remain badly splintered,
however.

   MOLDAVIA: The Moldavian People's Front, an independent political
movement, is the main challenger to the Communist Party. The front
initially wants political sovereignty from the Kremlin, followed
eventually by full independence. Moldavia was once part of Romania.
The overthrow of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu has increased
the passion for independence or a return to Romania.

   LITHUANIA: Lithuania's parliament declared the republic of 3.8

   ESTONIA: The parliament on March 30 declared the Soviet Union an
occupying power and pledged to restore full independence gradually.
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at first offered Estonia, a
republic of 1.5 million, ``special status'' in a revamped Soviet
federation if it would drop its independence bid. But Estonia
persisted, and Gorbachev issued a decree declaring the Estonian
declaration of March 30 invalid.

   LATVIA: Latvia proclaimed itself independent May 4, but its
measure calls for a transition period of unspecified length. About
54 percent of the republic's population of 2.7 million is Latvian.
The rest are mainly Russians, many of whom oppose independence. Like
Estonia, Latvia first got an offer from Gorbachev of special status
in a renewed federation, but its declaration of independence
amounted to a rejection of that offer. Gorbachev also declared
Latvia's declaration of independence invalid.

   Jury selection in the drug and perjury trial of
Mayor Marion Barry entered its second day today as the defense said
it may call the mayor's campaign manager and two members of his
round-the clock security detail as witnesses.
   Defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy made the disclosure in court as
the judge in the case began individual questioning of the 250
potential jurors summoned to U.S. District Court.
   Barry joked with reporters as he arrived on a brilliant spring
day, asking one whether he wanted to play tennis. Once inside the
courtroom he chatted with artists, asking them how long it takes to
draw their sketches for television.
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to all 14 of the charges against
him. Sources close to the case say plea bargaining efforts so far
have left the two sides far apart.
   By early afternoon, a half-dozen potential jurors had been
questioned by the judge and lawyers, including an FBI clerk who said
she could be a fair and impartial juror and an art teacher who said
she would have trouble presuming Barry's innocence.
   Others included a lawyer, a city housing department employee and
a man who was excused after he said he was preparing to move out of
the city and that his mother was dying. Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson said he would rule at the end of the day whether those
questioned would be sent into the jury pool.
   In addition to the campaign manager and security guards, Monday
said he may call 14 others to testify in support of the mayor. The
names of the two security guards, James Stays and Fred Gaskins, were
already included in a questionnaire being given prospective jurors
in the case. Mundy said he wanted the names of Anita Bonds, the
campaign manager, and the others added to the list.
   Law enforcement and city government sources have said that
prosecutors were on the verge of questioning Bonds about a number of
issues when a grand jury returned a 14-count indictment against the
mayor on May 10.
   Bonds has said she had not received a subpoena to testify but was
informed by police officials working on the case that prosecutors
wished to speak with her.
   Among those Mundy said he may call is Daniel Butler, a
neighborhood activist who city government sources say has been a
late-night companion of the mayor's for a number of years.
   Also on the list is David Rivers, a former top city official and
close friend of Barry's who is currently on trial in the same
courthouse for allegedly steering city contracts to friends and
business associates.
   The city government sources have said that Rivers and his
co-defendant, city contractor John Clyburn, both frequently
socialized with the mayor.
   Mundy did not mention Rivers by name and he is not on the list
provided to jurors, but when Jackson read back a list of possible
defense witnesses, the judge mentioned Rivers.
   Jackson said he hoped to evaluate by the end of the day 50 of the
250 potential jurors who spent Monday filling out a 69-question form
designed to determine whether they can view the case impartially.
   The trial is expected to last about a month, while jury selection
could take at least a week.
   Barry has pleaded innocent to 10 counts of cocaine possession,
three counts of lying to a grand jury and one count of conspiracy.
The three perjury charges are felonies.
   Sources close to the case have said Barry's lawyers have been
conducting plea-bargain talks with federal prosecutors, but one
source said the two sides are at an impasse. The sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   A top city official said Barry is unwilling to consider pleading
guilty to a felony perjury charge, since that likely would send him
to jail. Such a development would bar him from governing or running
for re-election this November.
   ``That's something he just won't do,'' this source said. ``The
mayor can read the statute too. Why sign off on part of a worst-case
scenario?''
   ``There is not a feeling, on either side, of being under any kind
of time constraint,'' the source said.
   Barry has acknowledged he suffers from alcoholism, and the
potential panelists were asked whether they think that could be used
to excuse criminal activity.
   The questionnaire also included a section asking the respondents
to give their feelings about undercover sting operations, the method
used to produce Barry's arrest. In addition, they were asked whether
they thought the case against the black mayor was racially or
politically motivated.

<TEXT>
   The 12-foot American elm taken from White
House grounds and planted by President Bush near the state Capitol
last year is fighting for its life.
   Bismarck forester Paul Blumhardt says the tree was hurt by a late
frost that hit after unseasonably warm March weather brought out its
buds.
   The top of the tree appears lifeless, but buds can be found on
lower branches and foresters are waiting to see whether they will
bloom.
   ``It is our intent to do everything we can, if the tree can be
saved, to save it,'' Blumhardt said.
   Bush planted the tree in April 1989 at a ceremony attended by an
estimated 10,000 people celebrating North Dakota's centennial.
   The elm, descendant of a tree planted by John Quincy Adams, was
taken from the White House grounds.
   Bush has planted other ceremonial trees around the nation during
his presidency.

   Tim Newton did more than show off his
fiancee at his 10-year high school reunion. He married her.
   Newton told a friend at the weekend gathering of 1980 Star City
High School graduates that he and Tracy Byford had their wedding
rings and marriage license. He joked that if a minister were present
they'd tie the knot.
   Then the friend revealed that he was an ordained minister.
   That was all it took, said the new Mrs. Newton, 20.
   ``Everybody just kept on going, `Y'all ought to get married,'''
she said.
   She said Newton, 27, stood dumbfounded ``with a weird look on his
face'' before agreeing to the impromptu wedding.
   Women at the banquet started grabbing flowers from wall and table
arrangements to make a bridal bouquet. Newton picked a best man and
his intended chose a bride's maid. Another classmate played the
wedding march on a handy piano.
   After the ceremony, there were cheers, and then the 75-or-so
classmates rustled up some cake and champagne for the
reunion-turned-reception.
   There even was a band to serenade the newlyweds.

   Earrings may be fine on pirates and punk-rockers,
but not on policemen in rural Peotone, an appellate court ruled.
   The 7th U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Monday patrolmen Gary Zybak
and Marvin Rathert cannot wear their ear studs _ even when off duty.
   ``I really shouldn't comment about the appellate court ruling
without talking to my attorney, but one thing is certain _ I'm not
quitting the force or leaving Peotone,'' Zybak said Monday night in
a telephone interview.
   ``I'm very happy here, I've been here since 1968, and I consider
it my hometown.''
   Hometown values prevailed in the appellate decision, which upheld
an earlier ruling by U.S. District Judge James Holderman in favor of
Police Chief Gary N. Bogart and other officials in Peotone, 45 miles
south of Chicago.
   ``The record shows that even some family members and officer
colleagues were disturbed by the ear studs as much as were the city
officials,'' wrote Appeals Judge Harlington Wood Jr.
   ``It is obvious from the record that the plaintiffs not only
caused an adverse impact on police discipline, esprit de corps and
uniformity ... but caused great public dissatisfaction as well,''
Wood added.
   Zybak and Rathert bought the studs and had their ears pierced in
December 1986 at a jewelry store in Matteson. Zybak said he and
Rathert were just trying to make an off-duty fashion statement.
   ``We didn't mean to wear them on duty, but unfortunately, when
you first get your ears pierced, you have to keep the studs in for
about six weeks so they won't close up,'' he said. ``On-duty, we
kept Band-aids over them, but that wasn't good enough, I guess.''
   Officials in the town of about 3,000 received complaints from
some of Peotone's four other full-time officers, residents and even
Rathert's wife.
   ``We both received a strong reprimand about the earrings in
January 1987, and Officer Rathert _ he was a sergeant then _ was
demoted and suffered a pay cut,'' said Zybak, explaining why the two
men filed a federal lawsuit.
   The lawsuit contended the village's real motive was to promote
``conservative or narrow-minded views.''
   Wood disagreed.
   ``The important responsibilities of these police officers do not
include attempting to change the village's political and social
outlook, whatever it may be, by wearing ear studs,'' he wrote for
the three-judge panel.
   The court said the ban on ear studs should apply even when the
men are off duty because the community is small and most people know
who the officers are even when they are out of uniform.
   ``There is little difference in the way the village's police
officers are publicly viewed, whether their objectionable conduct as
police officers occurs on duty or off, whether they wear the ear
stud on duty or off,'' the ruling said.

   Under a cloudless sky at high noon, the motorcade of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev purred smoothly over roads lined with palm trees on the
campus of Stanford University.
   And the children of an unfettered capitalism, wearing Sony
Walkmans and riding mountain bikes, clamored after it in loud
pursuit: ``Gor-bEEEEE. Gor-bEEEEE. Gor-bEEEEE.''
   Under a low, angled roof in the Ukrainian-American Center on
Minneapolis' northeast side, a few graying immigrants ate eggs and
pyrohy (dumplings), drank strong coffee and gathered up their
materials to make angry signs. Then, bundled up against unseasonably
cool June temperatures, they headed for neighboring St. Paul to meet
the same motorcade.
   And when they caught up with it, some chanted less flattering
things: ``Wrecker! Destroyer! Out of the Baltic States!''
   Coming or going, conciliatory or sharp-tongued, in the
sun-drenched Bay Area on Monday or the cold drizzle of the Upper
Midwest on Sunday, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev never failed
to draw a crowd.
   He could be unpredictable. He accommodated knots of screaming
protesters and smiling families with equal aplomb, lingering longest
among those crowds whose adulation swelled until the Secret Service
agents guarding him were red with frustration and the elected
officials squiring him were green with envy.
   In San Francisco, his wife, Raisa, bolted from the motorcade at
one point and swooped down unannounced on Fisherman's Wharf,
stepping out of the car just long enough to ring the bell on a cable
car.
   The Gorbachevs gave the impression that they went where they
wanted, saw what they wanted and said what they wanted to say.
   Though many of the impromptu jaunts no doubt were conceived as
photo opportunities rather than getting-to-know-you excursions,
their skill and savvy at every turn earned them respect _ even if it
sometimes came grudgingly.
   At about 3 p.m. Sunday, Gorbachev nixed a scheduled visit to a
family farm outside Minneapolis. Inside the Hubert Humphrey
Metrodome, which had been converted into a media center for the
visit, a harried Secret Service agent put down his radio and threw
up his hands.
   ``The guy is a nightmare, jumps out of the car when he wants to
and strolls any place he feels like. You've seen the things in the
newspapers about us not knowing what's going on? Well,'' he said,
``they're true.''
   If that was the case, a reporter asked, who was calling the shots?
   The agent looked toward the oversized TV screen high above the
wall in left centerfield. On it, the Gorbachev motorcade was
pictured zooming back toward downtown.
   ``I'd bet it's him,'' the agent said. ``The guy in the car.''

   Halfway down Palm Drive, his wheelchair braced against the curb,
John Looper sat patiently Monday and scanned the slowing string of
black Zil limousines.
   Ten years ago, Looper lost the use of his legs in a motorcycle
accident, but it slowed him very little; two hours ago, he'd parked
at the edge of the Stanford campus and unceremoniously wheeled two
miles to reach this vantage point.
   When the 30-year-old software engineer told colleagues why he was
taking the day off, a few chuckled and a few others told him to
catch the traveling Gorbachevs on TV.
   But Looper would not be dissuaded; this bit of history he was
determined to catch himself. In the span of a breath, the familiar
face appeared at the open window, caught his eye, waved, and just as
quickly, moved on.
   As the roller skates and bicycles, skateboards and motor scooters
rumbled past on the sidewalk, Looper began the two-mile trip back.
   ``It was worth it,'' he said. ``We watch TV so much that so many
of the things you see just don't seem real any more.
   ``I felt like I had to see the man. This is a pivotal point in
history. Who knows what's going to happen in the future? I support
what Gorbachev is doing and with public opinion what it is back
home, I figure he could use the help.
   ``But there are selfish reasons, too. When I see him in the
history books 20 years from now,'' Looper said, ``I'm going to be
able to tell my kids that we exchanged waves.''

   At Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich's residence two blocks down on the
auspiciously named Summit Avenue, chefs were making final
preparations for Gorbachev's lunch while pacifist Jean Remke and
several of the women with whom she shares a mansion were stringing
together quilted panels for a ``peace ribbon'' to wrap around the
outside of their home.
   Many of the panels, with their pastoral scenes of nature and
families, had been part of the peace ribbon unveiled in Washington
in 1985 and, in one of the more creative protests against the arms
race, used to encircle the Pentagon. Several subsequently were
presented to the Gorbachevs at a U.S.-Soviet summit.
   ``Some people laughed then, but I think it's done good,'' Virgina
Hessian Mulvaney said. ``Gorbachev is here and nuclear weapons are
on the way out.''
   She went on to explain that her daughter was born on the same day
of a Sputnik launch by the Soviets, and how that fateful coincidence
inspired her to conceive a poem about peaceful coexistence even as
she lay on a delivery table in the labor room.
   Ever since, she remained convinced that this day of cooperation
between the superpowers would come. And last week, she was the first
caller on a radio show taping messages to forward to the Gorbachevs.
She recited as much of the poem as time would allow.
   But Ms. Mulvaney admitted a moment later that she was discouraged
to learn not all Minnesotans were viewing the historic visit with
the same serious-mindedness. The second caller simply joked about
cleaning his house if Gorbachev agreed to stop by.
   ``And the third,'' she added, more disheartened, ``only talked
about taking him fishing.''

   Some people were doing more than talking about capitalism Monday
at Stanford; an opportunistic few were out practicing.
   At 11 a.m., Marlowe Johnson lowered his ticket-for-sale sign and
brushed his long bangs back over the top of wire-rimmed glasses. The
ducat he held was won in a lottery conducted among Stanford students
for a chance to hear Gorbachev speak. He was hoping to convert it
into a meal ticket.
   ``The highest price I've heard,'' he said, ``is $1,800. I got an
offer for $500 earlier this morning and turned it down. Might have
been a mistake.''
   And who, he was asked, was laying out that kind of money?
   ``Rich, kooky people,'' Johnson said. ``Maybe alumni.''

<TEXT>
   If Jim Wright has any regrets about
resigning as House Speaker, he's not saying so. And they aren't
showing.
   He looks tanned and relaxed in his Fort Worth office, which is
cluttered by papers and memorabilia from 34 years in Congress, along
with notes for the book he is writing on Central America.
   Wright says he hasn't been happier in years, and talks without
bitterness about his resignation a year ago during an ethics
investigation.
   ``I have a sort of predestinarian's view of things, almost a
religious conviction, that things happen for the better. And I just
accept it that way,'' Wright said in a recent interview.
   Wright delivered his resignation speech to the House on May 31,
1989. Six days later, he officially gave up the post he had held for
about two years. He left Congress on June 30.
   He stepped down after the House Ethics Committee said Wright
violated House rules 69 times involving sales of his book,
``Reflections of a Public Man,'' and in business deals with his
friend George Mallick of Fort Worth.
   Wright maintains the charges were false and brought by his
enemies. He insists that he never knowingly violated House rules. He
said events leading to his resignation ``fell together to create
this jigsaw puzzle out of which there was no escape.''
   But Wright said his fall from power did allow him an escape of
sorts: he's now free to do things that were impossible in
Washington, such as having dinner with his wife, Betty, and spending
time with his children and grandchildren.
   The 67-year-old Wright still works long days, writing, giving
speeches or guest lectures at colleges, and appearing at
fund-raisers for fellow Democrats. He recently attended a gathering
for his replacement, Pete Geren, who often consults Wright for
advice.
   An avid gardener, Wright spent a recent weekend planting 52 rose
bushes in his back yard, ``and had a few sore muscles.''
   ``I'm happy. I'm as busy as I want to be, and I'm not nearly as
busy as I used to be. I'm very glad I'm not,'' he said. ``During my
last 12 years in Congress I was running to catch up. It was a
constant choice between most urgent and merely urgent, and the
simply important never got done.''
   Wright's study in his new, three-bedroom home contains few signs
of his tenure in Washington, which he says at times was
``oppressive, hectic, harried, harassing.''
   He refuses to criticize his successor Speaker Tom Foley or the
House, except to say it's not moving ``with any discernible clarity
or purpose.''
   He still believes actions by his nemesis, Republican Rep. Newt
Gingrich, and special prosecutor Richard Phelan amounted to
``character assassination.''
   And Wright blames the media for ``a voracious thirst for
scandal.'' He says reporters didn't give him a chance to tell his
side.
   During the past year, Mallick went to bankruptcy court and
liquidated the company that was under House investigation.
   Mrs. Wright, whose job with the company, Mallightco, was
questioned by the ethics committee, is less circumspect than her
husband in assessing the investigation.
   ``I think that it leaves scars. I don't think there's any way to
get away from it,'' she said.
   Wright said he sometimes yearns to be involved when he sees
reports about such things as the crumbling of the Berlin Wall or
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to the United States.
   ``But there are other people who can do those things. I had my
chance. I had 34 years, and that's plenty. I did everything I could
do and the best I could do,'' he said.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo, often mentioned as a
potential 1992 presidential contender, formally launched his
campaign for another term as governor today by promising ``to work
as hard as anybody can in this job.''
   ``This has been one great big Democratic celebration and we're
going to have another one on Election Day, Nov. 6 when we win
everything in sight,'' said Cuomo, accepting Monday's unanimous
nomination from delegates to the New York state Democratic
convention.
   To cheers and standing ovations, Cuomo said he was seeking
election to a third four-year term because ``New York has arrived at
the edge of a new century and a new millennium'' that held ``new
obstacles.''
   ``I'm here today because I am committed to helping the people of
the State of New York meet these new challenges,'' said the governor.
   Cuomo's address served as the rhetorical finale for the carefully
orchestrated two-day gathering.
   Although he wasn't at the state Democratic convention when he
gained the nomination by acclamation, he appeared Monday night at a
reception put on by his campaign committee.
   ``The ideas, the emphasis, the commitment that brought us this
far are the ideas, the emphasis and the commitment that will carry
us the rest of the way, no matter how far that is,'' said Cuomo, 57.
   At a subsequent news conference, Cuomo said the campaign's
overriding issue would be ``the future. What do you do about the
21st century and how do you get us there? Who has the capacity to
get us there?''
   Asked if that didn't have a presidential ring to it, Cuomo
scoffed.
   ``You're so full of baloney,'' said the governor.
   Last week, New York Republicans chose Manhattan economist Pierre
Rinfret, a 66-year-old political unknown, to challenge Cuomo.
   The governor announced his re-election plans Sunday during a
visit to campaign workers preparing for the convention.
   Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro told
reporters that if Cuomo wanted it, he could get the Democratic
nomination for president in 1992.
   She said Democrats she has talked to ``believe that he can be the
person who can carry the Democrats to the White House in 1992.''

<TEXT>
   Police shot to death 13 suspected Sikh
extremists, and at least 22 other people were killed in a renewed
bout of separatist violence in the northern state of Punjab, news
reports said Tuesday.
   The killings occurred in separate incidents during a 24-hour
period ending Tuesday night. They were reported on the sixth
anniversary of an Indian army raid on the Sikhs' holiest shrine, the
Golden Temple.
   At least 1,200 people were killed when troops backed by heavy
artillery attacked the temple in Amritsar on June 3, 1984, to flush
out Sikh militants entrenched inside. The assault lasted four days.
   The government increased security around the Golden Temple on
Tuesday and prohibited a special congregation planned for inside the
shrine to mark the anniversary of the raid, the Press Trust of India
news agency reported.
   In a dispatch from the Punjab state capital of Chandigarh, PTI
said the 13 Sikhs killed by police included three who were about to
set fire to a railroad station building in Punjab early Tuesday.
   Police found two AK-47 assault rifles, kerosene cans and
matchboxes with the victims, PTI said.
   It said the three men belonged to the Khalistan Commando Force,
one of the several militant groups in Punjab fighting for a separate
Sikh homeland. Khalistan is the name of the Sikhs' proposed homeland.
   PTI said among the other militants killed were Harcharan Singh of
the Khalistan Liberation Front and Kashmira Singh, a self-styled
lieutenant general of Babbar Khalsa, or the Pure Lion.
   The two groups and the Khalistan Commando Force are among the top
Sikh militant organizations in Punjab, a rich farming state
bordering Pakistan.
   In other violence blamed on the Sikh campaign, Press Trust said
five armed youths raided a house in Chogwan village, 230 miles north
of New Delhi, and fatally shot a couple and their daughter late
Monday.
   In another incident, a man and his daughter were burned to death
by unidentified assailants, PTI said. It did not say where or when
it happened.
   It said extremists killed 17 other people in separate incidents
in the state but did not give details.
   The deaths raised to 1,036 the number of people killed this year
in the Sikh separatist violence. Many of the victims have been from
the state's minority Hindu community, but militants have also
targeted Sikhs who do not support their cause.
   Sikh militants have been fighting since 1982 for an independent
homeland in Punjab, where Sikhs are in a slight majority over
Hindus. The Sikhs claim they are discriminated against by the
Hindus, who make up 82 percent of India's 880 million people.

   The state Senate today approved a $528
million compromise plan to overhaul the school finance system, and
the House passed a sales tax increase to pay for the reform bill.
   The school finance reform bill was sent to the House on a 29-1
vote.
   The money-raising measures go to the Senate for consideration,
including a quarter-cent sales tax increase and boosts in the levies
on tobacco, that passed the House on a 117-23 vote.
   Lawmakers are in the second day of a record sixth special
session, and state leaders have predicted quick passage of the
school finance overhaul.
   ``We're going to put it on the fast track and hope we can get it
out of here within the next four or five days,'' House Speaker Gib
Lewis, a Democrat from Fort Worth, said as lawmakers convened in
special session Monday.
   The compromise plan for the 1990-91 school year was worked out
among Democratic legislative leaders and Republican Gov. Bill
Clements on Friday in response to a Texas Supreme Court order to
make more money available to poor school districts.
   A similar order was issued today in New Jersey; and 11 other
states also have been under court order to overhaul their school
financing to make sure children in poor districts don't get
shortchanged.
   In addition to addressing financing, the Texas education bill
would make a number of changes designed to improve education
performance and accountability.
   Among other items, it would allow expansion of the
pre-kindergarten program to 3-year-olds in 1992; increase testing of
students; and give the governor the authority to appoint the state
education commissioner who would have the power to appoint new
management for problem school districts for up to three years.
   Clements killed two previous school finance reform plans after
objecting to lawmakers' plan to help pay for them with a half-cent
increase in the sales tax. The new compromise calls for a
quarter-cent increase, to 6\ from 6 cents per dollar.
   When he agreed to the tax increase Friday, Clements said there
was no other way to enact a school reform plan without court
intervention. He called lawmakers into their fourth consecutive
special session on school finance reform, following two last year on
workers' compensation.

<TEXT>
   Guy C. McElroy, an art historian who organized
an exhibition on the portrayal of black people in American art, died
last week of a pulmonary embolism, it was learned Tuesday. He was 44.
   McElroy conceived the show titled ``Facing History: The Black
Image in American Art, 1710-1940,'' four years ago and was guest
curator at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, where the exhibition opened
last January. The show is now appearing at the Brooklyn Museum in
New York.
   McElroy had held curatorial posts in museums and public galleries
on the East and West coasts since the mid-1970s.
   When he died Thursday at George Washington University Hospital
here, he had nearly completed work toward a doctorate in art history
from the University of Maryland and had begun work on an exhibition
on black educator Mary McLeod Bethune for the Bethune Museum-Archive
in Washington.
   A native of Fairmont, W.Va., McElroy held master's degrees in art
history from the University of Cincinnati and in mass communications
from Emerson College in Boston. He was a former Rockefeller fellow
in museum studies at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.

   ``Tonight Show'' producer Fred De Cordova
was listed in stable condition in a North Carolina hospital
following surgery for an aneurysm, NBC said.
   De Cordova, 79, who has produced ``The Tonight Show Starring
Johnny Carson'' for two decades, underwent the surgery Friday for an
aneurysm of the aorta, network spokeswoman Merry Aronson said Monday.
   She said he was taken to an undisclosed hospital Friday from his
hotel in the Winston-Salem area, where he was playing golf.
   Ms. Aronson didn't specify what type of aortic aneurysm De
Cordova had. She also didn't elaborate on his condition, saying only
that he was stable.
   After a stint as a stage director that ended with ``Ziegfeld
Follies'' in 1943, De Cordova signed with Warner Bros. He directed
about 50 films, including ``Bedtime for Bonzo,'' starring Ronald
Reagan and a chimpanzee.
   In 1953, De Cordova moved to television, directing or producing
``My Three Sons,'' ``Burns and Allen'' and ``The Jack Benny Show,''
before joining Carson in what he has called ``the best job in
television.''

   Garrison Keillor returned home and told
former neighbors they didn't inspire whimsical Lake Wobegon, the
fictitious town made famous in his radio show, ``A Prairie Home
Companion.''
   ``Lake Wobegon is not about Anoka,'' he said Monday. ``It's a
romance, a comic romance, and Anoka is a real place and it's
infinitely more complicated and interesting.''
   He also delivered the commencement address at Anoka High School,
telling students: ``Graduation is a graceful and sweet old ceremony.
What it means is that it's time to gather your stuff together and
get out.''
   The author and humorist thanked his hometown for helping spawn
the insecurity he says he needed to become a writer.
   ``On the off chance that Anoka might feel bad, might feel guilty
for making me feel inferior, I came back to say it's all right,'' he
said.
   Keillor, 47, has written four books. He lives in New York and is

   Actress Judy Carne, who delivered the slapstick
straight line ``Sock it to me'' on ``Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In,''
pleaded guilty to a contempt of court charge and was fined $250.
   A prescription forgery charge was dismissed in the court action
Monday.
   Both charges date to 1979, when Miss Carne was accused of heroin
possession and prescription forgery while appearing at a
Cincinnati-area dinner theater.
   She was acquitted of heroin possession but the jury could not
reach a verdict on the prescription forgery charge.
   The contempt charge was filed when Miss Carne failed to appear
for her forgery retrial.
   Miss Carne, who divides her time in England and the United
States, faced renewed prosecution after a routine computer check by
customs agents at a New York airport May 19 revealed the warrant.

   Vice President Dan Quayle
congratulated Michigan fans on the Detroit Pistons' repeat
appearance in the NBA finals, but reminded them the team was born in
the nation's basketball heartland.
   ``I want everyone to know the Detroit Pistons came from
Indiana,'' the native Hoosier said Monday at a fund-raising luncheon.
   The remarks by the former U.S. senator from Indiana came on the
eve of Game 1 of the seven-game series between Detroit and the
Portland Trail Blazers.
   The defending National Basketball Association champion Pistons
originated as the Fort Wayne Pistons, and moved to Detroit in 1957.
   Quayle picked Detroit to repeat as NBA champs in ``more than
four, perhaps not seven'' games.
   Hinting that a politician's sports picks should be taken with a
grain of salt, Quayle said jokingly, ``Now, tonight, I'm flying to
Oregon.''

   Beach volleyball king Sinjin Smith is the
quintessential Californian _ tall, blond, tan and toothsome _ and
People magazine just tagged him one of the world's most beautiful
people.
   ``Looks are really a subjective thing. Among my peers it's a
joke,'' Smith said of the honor. ``They don't know how to react. I
mean, I'm one of the guys, and then all of a sudden there I am with
other people like Paul Newman and Tom Cruise.''
   Smith is part of People's ``photo spectacular extra'' issue, now
on the stands, which lists 50 people picked as the world's most
beautiful. The 33-year-old spiker joins the likes of Newman, Cruise,
Michelle Pfeiffer and Isabella Rossellini.
   Smith credits the flourishing popularity of professional beach
volleyball for his sudden rise to fame.
   ``What other sport can you see guys without shirts running around
diving, doing all this stuff, showing their rippling muscles and the
fans can sit five feet away?'' he asks.
   Smith, dubbed the ``King of Beach Volleyball,'' is the most
successful player in the sport's history with more than 100
tournament wins. He has appeared on TV in ``Magnum, P.I.'' and the
recent ``Sideout'' beach movie.
   ``Some people may see me as the male equivalent of a bimbo, a
beach bum, you know, sitting around the beach all week waiting for
the tournaments to come around so I can make some dough,'' Smith
said. ``They don't realize there's so much more involved than just
what they see.''

   New ethnic rioting surged through the Central Asian
city of Osh on Tuesday, and the Soviet media reported a state of
emergency was imposed after 11 people were killed.
   Houses and cars were burned and and more than 200 people were
reported injured in the clashes between Uzbeks and Kirghiz in Osh, a
Kirghizian city on the border with Uzbekistan.
   The fighting began Monday over a land disupte between the two
predominantly Moslem ethnic groups. Soviet troops were unable to
control the situation.
   It was the latest outbreak of ethnic fighting in the Soviet Union
and occurred as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was concluding his
summit in the Unites States and returned to face an array of
domestic troubles.
   Battles continued Tuesday between groups numbering between 200
and 600, the Interfax news agency reported. It said among the dead
were a master sergeant of the Interior Ministry troops and a police
cadet.
   ``The situation is very grave and it's getting worse,'' said
Khalil Tashmatov, head of the Osh branch of the Interior Ministry,
in a telephone interview. ``There are cases of pogroms and houses
being burned down,'' he said.
   He said Soviet troops were trying to maintain order but ``there
aren't enough of them.''
   At least seven houses were set ablaze along with eight cars
Monday night in the city of about 210,000, according to reports from
Tass and Interfax, which is affiliated with state-run Radio Moscow.
   At least 51 people were arrested, and a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew
was in force in Osh. Interior Ministry troops patrolled the streets,
setting up roadblocks and guarding industrial sites, Tass and
Interfax said.
   Maj. Gen. Viktor Goncharov, the interior minister of Kirghizia,
was appointed military commander of the region, they said.
   The dispute reportedly centered on plots of land claimed by both
sides near the city, which has Central Asia's largest silk factory.
Kirghizia lies in the Tien Shan and Pamir mountains and borders
western China.
   A group of Kirghiz who wanted new housing occupied the land to
begin constructing houses. Uzbeks, who make up 30 percent of the
population, demanded they also receive land for housing, Tass said.
   Tashmatov accused activists of a group known as Osaimagy, the
Kirghiz word for circle, of claiming the land illegally and sparking
the dispute.
   Housing is critically short in the republics of Central Asia.
Earlier violence in the region was triggered in part by fears that
the government had plans to give apartments to refugees fleeing
ethnic unrest in other parts of the country.
   Interfax and Tass said about 10,000 Uzbeks gathered Monday to
protest in the field of a collective farm and faced off against
about 1,500 Kirghiz.
   Premier Apas Dzhumagulov of Kirghizia, Communist Party Secretary
Medetkan Sherimkulov and other officials spoke to them and tried to
calm the situation. But at about 6 p.m., a large group of Kirghiz
came to the site, the news services said.
   A group of about 900 Interior Ministry troops and local police
fired blanks to disperse the crowd, they reported, but groups
rampaged through the city, setting fires and trying to attack
Interior Ministry headquarters.
   Of the 200 injured, 111 were hospitalized, some with bullet
wounds, Tass and Interfax said. Among the injured were 21 police
officers.
   Emoldened by Gorbachev's reforms, residents of Central Asian
republics such as Kirghizia and Uzbekistan have been expressing
their religious, ethnic, political and economic concerns. Some have
vented their frustrations through violence.
   There has been ethnic violence in Tadzhikistan, and Soviet
soldiers remain in the republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan to
control ethnic violence that has wracked the two republics for two
years.

<HEAD>Golf Tourneys, Conferences Lure Lawmakers With Free Trips</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Dan Burton is a popular figure at charity
golf tournaments, where he's among a small circle of lawmakers who
get free flights, meals and lodging for being a celebrity player.
   Tournament sponsors and airlines pay for the tickets, food and
hotel rooms. Lawmakers who love golf get the perk even if they're
not the national celebrities charity tournaments like to attract.
   House financial disclosure records released last week showed that
Burton, an Indiana Republican without a national following,
participated in six tournaments in 1989.
   Others with multiple appearances at such tournaments include Rep.
Marty Russo, D-Ill., Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat
who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, and Minority Leader
Bob Michel, also from Illinois.
   The trips are examples of the lifestyle that members of Congress
may live _ partially at others' expense _ within the rules of the
House and Senate.
   House members last year got free trips, lodging and meals for
going conferences at Florida's five-star Boca Raton Resort, the
island of St. Croix, Palm Springs, Calif., Montego Bay, Jamaica, and
a mountain retreat in Switzerland.
   ``Members of Congress who like to play golf _ when they're not in
session and there's no business in the district _ can help charity
and have fun,'' Burton said. ``It's a respite we really enjoy.''
   Burton had a busy golf schedule in 1989: the Bob Hope Classic in
Palm Springs in January; the Kemper Open in Washington in May; the
Larry Bird Youth Links tournament in Indianapolis (his district) in
June; the Arte Johnson golf tournament in Chicago in July; the Danny
Thompson Memorial tournament in Sun Valley, Idaho, in August; and
the Sugarloaf Invitation tournament in Maine in September.
   Burton said he paid his own way to the Hope tournament and stayed
with friends. All the tournaments, he said, donated profits to
charity.
   The financial disclosure records showed that Burton participated
in six golf tournaments in 1989, Rostenkowski in five, Russo in
three and Michel in two.
   Russo's disclosure showed he received round-trip air
transportation from Chicago to West Palm Beach, Fla., five days
lodging and travel expenses to take part in the Chrysler Team
Championship Golf Tournament.
   The records show that golf outings, and more traditional trips to
conferences sponsored by special-interest groups, often appear more
valuable than the $2,000 per speech that lawmakers may earn for
addressing those organizations.
   The free perks will become even more precious to House members
Jan. 1, when honoraria will be banned in return for a hefty pay
raise.
   This year, House members are allowed to earn the same amount of
honoraria as last year, $26,850. Senators are still allowed
honoraria and may keep it until the figure reaches 40 percent of
their salary. The remainder is donated to charity.
   Rostenkowski played in the Hope Classic, the Kemper Open, the
Helene Curtis Pro Am, the J.C. Penney tournament in Largo, Fla., and
the Chrysler Team Championship in Wellington, Fla.
   Rostenkowski, led the House in honoraria, earning $285,000 and
giving $258,150 to charity.
   Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., was among the congressional guests at
the four-day Securities Industry Association conference at the Boca
Raton Resort in Florida.
   The resort has 29 tennis courts, a 23-slip marina, rooms that
range from $195-$340 per night and suites that start at $380 nightly.
   Association spokesman Art Samansky said lawmakers ``discuss
industry conditions and trends or areas of legislation which may be
of interest to the securities industry.''
   Farleigh Dickinson University, with its main campuses in New
Jersey, invited 11 House members and 10 members of the British
Parliament to a four-day conference in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
   While conferees used the school's St. Croix campus to promote
understanding between the two nations' legislators, the school paid
for rooms at the Divi Resort, which had a major water sports
facility. The entire complex later suffered extensive damage from
Hurricane Hugo.
   ``There are junkets and there are more legitimate things. This
was legitimate and an important conference,'' said university
spokeswoman Alice Olick. The school paid for lawmakers' rooms, meals
and transportation.
   The Aspen Institute, a Colorado-based research group, arranges
retreats around the world for lawmakers who serve on its advisory
panels. The lawmakers discuss U.S. relations with the Soviet Union,
southern Africa and Indochina.
   When former Sen. Dick Clark launched the institute's
congressional retreats five years ago, he chose a site not too far
from Washington _ North Carolina's Eastern Shore.
   ``It was just a ... disaster to be honest,'' he said.
   The invited lawmakers came late and left early because of
changing events in Washington, just a short flight away. Even when
they attended the seminars, Clark said, they spent half their time
on the phone.
   So Clark literally searched the globe for a solution.
   The itinerary last year was: Jamaica in January; Bermuda in
March; a mountain retreat in Switzerland in August, followed weeks
later by several days in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia.

   Art Lund, a singer and actor who was the
first male lead singer with the Benny Goodman Orchestra, has died.
He was 75.
   Funeral services were held Monday in this Salt Lake City suburb
for Lund, who died Thursday. Burial is scheduled for Wednesday at
the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn in California.
   The cause of death was not available.
   Lund, who was born in Salt Lake City, joined Goodman's orchestra
after a band member heard him sing in Kentucky and asked him to
audition.
   While with the orchestra, Lund earned five gold records,
including for ``Blue Skies'' and ``My Blue Heaven.''
   In 1942, he joined the Navy and rose to lieutenant commander,
serving in the Pacific for four years. After the war, he rejoined
Goodman's band.
   He also starred in several Broadway productions, playing the
original Joey in ``Most Happy Fella.''
   Lund's movies included ``The Molly Maguires'' and ``The Last
American Hero.'' He appeared in television programs such as
``Gunsmoke,'' ``The Rockford Files'' and ``Little House on the
Prairie.''
   In the 1960s, Lund was honored by the Hollywood Chamber of
Commerce with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
   Lund's first wife, Kathleen Virginia Bolanz, died in 1969. In
1989, Lund married Janet Burris Chytraus in Solvang, Calif. The
couple moved to Holladay in April.

   President Bush paid tribute Tuesday to the
peacetime GI Bill, saying the college benefits are helping the armed
forces attract better recruits than ever.
   The Rose Garden ceremony honored the program as the number of
participants reached the 1 million mark.
   Bush, who was among the first wave of veterans to head off to
college on the original GI Bill, said the version enacted in 1984 is
``an important component in the success of America's all-volunteer
forces.''
   It allows recruits on active duty or the reserves to draw a basic
benefit of up to $10,800 for college, in part by having their pay
reduced by $100-a-month for 12 months.
   Among those attending were Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Rep.
G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., the chief sponsor of the
legislation, Secretary of Transportation Samuel Skinner, top
military brass.
   A dozen enlisted men and women from the Army, Air Force, Navy,
Marines, Coast Guard, National Guard and the reserves joined Bush on
stage as representatives of the 1 million program participants.
   The Montgomery GI Bill provides up to $300 a month in benefits
for full-time students, but Montgomery wants to raise the monthly
stipend to $400.
   Bush, a close friend of Montgomery's, said the GI Bill ``ranks
among the most practical and cost-efficient programs ever devised.''
   Cheney called it crucial for recruitment and retention. He said
reserves were ``twice as likely to stay in the reserves'' in 1985-88
if they were saving for college.
   ``The size of our force may come down in the future, but quality
must remain at the absolute top,'' Cheney said. ``The GI Bill will
help us do that.''
   Bush, a Navy torpedo bomber pilot in World War II, said he was
among the first 40,000 veterans to use the GI Bill when he went to
Yale in 1945.
   ``The GI Bill changed the lives of millions by replacing old
roadblocks with paths of opportunity. ... Really it changed the life
of our nation,'' Bush said.
   The Pentagon says 71.2 percent of all active-duty service members
have chosen to participate in the Montgomery program over the past
year. It will cost $412 million in fiscal 1991.

   A U.S. Air Force jet fighter collided
Tuesday with what police said appeared to be a glider, killing the
civilian pilot.
   The F-16 fighter jet returned safely to base and its two-man crew
was not hurt, the Air Force said.
   The accident occurred about 4:30 p.m. near Unkenbach, 62 miles
southwest of Frankfurt, the Air Force said in a statement.
   ``The F-16 returned to Hahn Air Base with minor damage,'' the
statement said.
   ``The condition of the civilian aircraft is unknown,'' it said.
   Local police said the civilian craft ``was in all likelihood a
glider,'' and that the pilot was killed in the collision. A glider
is a small plane without a motor that rides air currents.
   No further information was immediately available.
   The F-16 was on a training mission at the time, the Air Force
said.
   Hahn Air Force base is near the western city of Trier.

   A lawyer rescued from the Atlantic with a
gunshot wound after a mysterious flight down the East Coast pleaded
guilty today to five felony charges that he misrepresented clients.
   Thomas Root, 37, a communications attorney, pleaded guilty to
submitting a counterfeit Federal Aviation Administration approval
form for a radio tower a client was seeking to erect in Missouri.
   Root also admitted giving a forged Federal Communications
Commission license application for a radio station he was
representing in North Carolina, and failing to inform another client
that he had accepted a settlement for one-fifth the amount his
client authorized.
   The guilty plea came a day after a North Carolina grand jury
returned a 455-count indictment charging Root with securities fraud
and other charges.
   The Alexandria, Va., attorney also pleaded guilty to a charge
that he submitted a phony lease option to a Long Island radio
station seeking a site to build a radio tower. Root also admitted
deceiving a client by falsely telling the radio station that he
would get its FCC license renewed.
   Root would not comment after entering his pleas. His attorney,
Eugene Propper, said Root ``feels he's getting a lot more
attention'' than he would if he had not made his plane flight, which
ended in the waters off Bermuda after Root allegedly passed out with
the plane on autopilot.
   Root has said he was unconscious the entire time, but Navy
fighter pilots flying near Root's plane said they saw him moving in
the cockpit.
   Still unexplained is a bullet wound Root suffered from a gun that
he had stored in a glove box in the single-engine plane.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens said an investigation by federal
officials in Florida is ongoing.
   In Raleigh, N.C., a Nash County grand jury issued indictments
against Root and others Monday that totaled 2,695 counts. Indicted
were Root, Sonrise Management Services, Telemedia Inc. and three
other men identified as co-owners of the two businesses.
   Root handled radio license applications for investors of Sonrise
Management before the Federal Communications Commission.
   The indictments allege the companies violated securities laws by
not registering securities, failing to register sales agents,
engaging in false and deceptive sales practices and conspiring to
violate securities laws.
   ``I really don't have any reaction until I see the indictment,
except to say that my client is not guilty of any securities
fraud,'' said Eugene Propper, Root's Washington attorney.
   The Columbus, Ga.-based Sonrise Management, which touted
Christian principles in sales literature and issued business cards
inscribed with crosses, went out of business several months ago.
   In announcing the indictment, North Carolina Secretary of State
Rufus Edmisten said only a handful of Sonrise Management investors
ever received FCC licenses.
   ``In all, 1,018 people in North Carolina contributed more than $8
million to this organization,'' Edmisten said. ``Nationally, more
than $16 million was invested by people from 25 states.''
   Edmisten said there is little chance investors will recoup their
money.
   ``I wish I could say to all the victims, `We'll get your money
back,''' he said. ``But I don't know that we'll ever get a penny
back. At the present time, I don't know of any money available to
make restitution.''
   The other men indicted, Sonrise Chairman Ralph Savage and company
President Eugene White, live in Phenix City, Ala. They joined with
Carl Hurlebaus, who also was indicted, to form Telemedia in Maryland.
   Root filed for bankruptcy court protection from creditors in
October 1989, claiming he had $1.6 million in liabilities.

<HEAD>Soviet Legislature Postpones Emigration Law Consideration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet legislature on Tuesday tentatively
postponed adoption of a law to ease restrictions on emigration,
possibly jeopardizing a summit deal that would vastly increase trade
with the United States.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed the trade agreement during
this week's Washington summit with President Bush. Bush's only
condition for implementing the trade agreement was that the Soviet
legislature give final approval to the long-awaited emigration law.
   But the Supreme Soviet on Tuesday approved an agenda that does
not include consideration of the law in its current session, which
ends June 14. The Supreme Soviet does not convene again until
September.
   The proposed law would permit emigration for virtually anyone who
has entry permission from another country and no outstanding
obligations, criminal charges or recent knowledge of state secrets.
It would set a basic limit of five years on the length of time a
citizen can be kept from emigrating because of access to secrets.
   There was no explanation for the decision to omit the item from
the agenda, and legislators held out the possibility it could still
be added during the current session.
   ``We will look it over and if there is a possibility, we will
include this issue. We will look it over with the president,'' said
Anatoly Lukyanov, the chairman of the legislature's executive
committee. Gorbachev returned to Moscow on Tuesday.
   Reform has allowed lawmakers to criticize the leadership, but
Gorbachev and Lukyanov _ his close ally _ almost without exception
have managed to bend the legislature to their will.
   It was not clear whether postponement of the law was made with
Gorbachev's approval, whether it was a mistake, or whether other
Kremlin leaders engineered the decision, possibly to embarrass the
absent leader.
   The unexpected step could signal that Gorbachev intends to make
good on his warning that he might curtail Jewish emigration if
Israel continues to settle emigres in occupied territory.
   Jewish activists in Moscow issued a statement Tuesday protesting
the threat, which Gorbachev made at a news conference in Washington
on Sunday.
   ``Soviet authorities have no moral or legal right to dictate to a
sovereign government where Jews who have lost their Soviet
citizenship should live,'' said the statement read over the
telephone by spokesman Oleg Nesterov.
   The statement called the threat ``one of a series of attempts to
use Jews as an object of trade in a political game.''
   Another possible reason for the delay might be that the Soviets
are not prepared to handle the number of people wanting to emigrate
and the demands they will place on transport and visa workers.
   The government may also be hesitating because an embarassingly
high number of people could choose to leave their country.
   Passage of the emigration law would affect an unknown number of
Soviets, including Jews and other ethnic groups. Without it, the
Soviet Union will not have access to million dollars in trade with
the United States under the summit agreement.
   The decision to delay consideration angered some Soviet lawmakers.
   ``We will turn out to be cheats. We won't be trusted. They will
say, `Well, they made a promise and again the Soviet Union is
deceiving,''' said Nikolai Medvedev, a legislator from Lithuania. He
said Soviet officials had promised U.S. senators during the summit
that the new emigration law would be approved before the legislative
session ends this month.
   Fyodor Burlatsky, a member of the legislature's International
Affairs committee, said in a television interview recently the law
would be considered May 31.
   The law passed on its first reading in November, but final action
has been delayed repeatedly by crises over other economic and
political reforms.
   Referring to potential lost trade with the United States, Supreme
Soviet member Igor Griazin of Estonia said, ``There are fairly
serious economic consequences to not adopting the law on entry and
exit.''
   Rudolf A. Kuznetsov, head of the visa-issuing agency UVIR, has
predicted 5 million to 6 million of the 287 million Soviets would
emigrate or travel abroad this year.
   Last month alone, Soviet authorities issued about 20,000 exit
visas.
   The bill under consideration would codify many changes that have
already been put into practice here. For example, procedures
required to obtain travel documents and permission to emigrate have
been eased tremendously in the last two years.
   Soviet officials acknowledge that the main obstacles to travel
have become the heavy workloads of emigration authorities, shortages
of plane and train tickets and problems with currency exchange.
Currently, Soviet citizens are allowed to exchange about $300 when
they go abroad on a guest or tourist visa, and this puts a strain on
the financially strapped Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo said Tuesday he
hoped his unprecedented talks with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev would lead to full diplomatic ties between the nations and
peace on the divided Korean peninsula.
   The meeting Monday between Roh and Gorbachev in San Francisco was
heralded by many as a boost to South Korea's international prestige.
But radical students denounced Roh's diplomatic overtures to
Communist nations.
   In a statement, Roh called the encounter, the first between a
South Korean and a Soviet leader, ``the greatest diplomatic event''
in South Korea's modern history.
   Roh said he hoped ``normal bilateral relations between our
countries'' would follow. Moscow is a long-time ally of Seoul's
archenemy, Communist North Korea.
   No dates were announced for establishing diplomatic relations,
but a Roh aide said that could be expected in the ``not-distant
future.''
   The South Korean newspaper Dong-a Ilbo said Roh agreed to send
Foreign Minister Choi Ho-joong to Moscow by July. It quoted
high-ranking officials as saying full diplomatic ties could be
established by September.
   Roh said South Korea would also devote efforts to establishing
ties with China, also a major ally of North Korea.
   Roh's announcement was welcomed by most South Koreans, who want
to see an easing of hostilities with the Communist north. The Koreas
were divided in 1945, fought a bloody war in the early 1950s and
remain bitter enemies.
   ``The summit meeting has not only been a turning point in
relations between the two countries, but has also been an
epoch-making event that will see an end to the Cold War legacy on
the Korean peninsula,'' Roh said in the statement.
   The nation's two television networks devoted five hours of live
satellite and local coverage to Roh's visit.
   Roh's opponents, however, were critical of Roh's diplomatic
maneuver and dissidents said he was trying to escape an internal
crisis by diverting attention to foreign affairs.
   A major alliance of dissident groups said Roh's diplomacy was
subservient and that the talks failed to present ``substantial
measures'' for peace.
   Radical students on Tuesday staged scattered protests against
Roh. They called for free contacts across the heavily fortified
border and unification with North Korea.
   In southern Kwangju, 2,000 students fought police with firebombs
and rocks outside five campuses, according to Yonhap, the South
Korean news agency.
   Roh has been pursuing a policy of establishing ties with current
and former Communist nations to isolate North Korea. South Korea now
maintains relations with all countries in East Europe except Albania
and East Germany.
   South Korea hopes diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union and China
will greatly enhance its international prestige and gain acceptance
for Seoul as an Asian and world power.
   The governing Democratic Liberal Party called the Roh-Gorbachev
talks, ``the historic first chapter of normalization of relations''
with the Soviet Union.
   ``The fact that the two met face to face is very important to
us,'' said Dr. Rhee Sang-woo, a government adviser and dean at
Seoul's Sogang University. ``Regardless of the subjects discussed,
the fact they met is most important.''
   The Party for Peace and Democracy, the main opposition party,
welcomed the prospect of normalizing relations with Moscow, but
criticized Roh for taking a low profile.
   ``It's regrettable President Roh did not bring up (other)
issues,'' including a Soviet apology for shooting down a South
Korean passenger plane in 1983, a party statement said.
   Korea was divided when Soviet and U.S. troops ended Japan's
colonial rule. The division deepened after the 1950-53 Korean war.
Technically, the two Koreas are still at war, with no peace treaty
signed.
   The border is the most heavily fortified in the world. It is
sealed by more than 1 million armed soldiers on either side
stationed behind concrete bunkers and barbed wire.

   The size of the black middle class has nearly
tripled over the past 30 years, but living standards and
opportunities for minorities still need much improvement, a group of
corporate and academic leaders said Tuesday.
   A report released by the Business-Higher Education Forum said
also that while more than one-third of American blacks and Hispanics
would be considered middle class, about 30 percent of minorities
live in poverty and that percentage is growing. It said also that
minorities are still much more likely to be poor than whites.
   Forum leaders called for comprehensive efforts to improve living
conditions and opportunities for minorities.
   ``I think we have to work at a variety of ways to do this and if
it finally comes down to higher taxes are the only answer, I think
we've got to deal with that issue,'' said Steven Mason, a
co-chairman of the task force that prepared the report.
   The report, ``Three Realities: Minority Life in the United
States,'' said racism, poor educational attainment, restricted
business opportunities and ``the stranglehold of the inner city''
limit minorities' hopes for improving their economic lots.
   The report called for restructuring public assistance programs
such as public housing, food stamps and job training, as well as
changing student financial aid programs. It also proposed a number
of other reforms.
   The changes, said the group of more than 90 heads of Fortune 500
corporations and leading colleges and universities, should bolster
the country's growing minority middle class and improve living
standards and opportunities for unskilled blacks, Hispanics and
other poor people.
   Mason and co-chairman Clifton Wharton, said the majority of the
forum members would accept a tax increase to pay for the proposed
changes but acknowledged ``it is unclear'' whether the majority
included most of the corporate members of the forum.
   ``I can't speak for all the top executives in the country, I can
only really speak for one,'' said Mason, president of The Mead Corp.
``My conviction is that these issues are important enough that they
have to be funded.''
   Wharton, head of Teachers Insurance Annuity Association of
America and the College Retirement Equities Fund, said the forum's
report focuses on three categories of blacks and Hispanics _ those
in the middle class, those ``at the margin,'' and those living in
poverty.
   The report found:
   _More than one-third of all blacks and Hispanics would be
considered middle class. The study said 60 percent of whites fit
that category.
   Nearly half of all blacks own their homes. About 1.5 million
blacks work as managers, business executives and professionals.
Nearly 7,000 blacks are elected officials.
   In 1987, 36 percent of black families had annual incomes of at
least $25,000. Among Hispanic families, 40 percent were in that
income bracket and owned their homes. More than 3,700 Hispanics hold
elective office.
   _Between 25 and 30 percent of all minorities are living ``at the
margin.'' Most of them are either semiskilled or unskilled workers
who, while holding jobs, earn minimum wage, moonlight, qualify for
some public aid, cannot afford health insurance but do not qualify
for Medicaid and rarely receive adequate help from food stamps and
unemployment programs.
   _About 30 percent of minorities live in poverty and that
percentage is growing. The poverty rate for blacks was nearly three
times that for whites in 1986. Between 1970 and 1980, the poorest
population in the five largest cities grew 161 percent.
   To help the working poor and impoverished move up the ladder, the
report recommended that the purchasing power of public employment
and training programs keep pace with inflation.
   The forum also called for full teenage employment by the turn of
the century, and full funding of the popular preschool programs Head
Start and Chapter One for poor youngsters. Officials said low-income
families should be informed when their children are young of
financial assistance opportunities for college, and institutions and
the federal government should use grants instead of loans to pay for
the first two years of college.
   In addition, the forum said corporations should expand minority
recruitment for all positions.
   ``We argue that the civil rights issue in the United States has
changed profoundly in the last 25 years,'' Mason said. ``We are
walking on new ground. A generation ago our concern was primarily
political equality. Today, the primary issue is economic equity.''

   The proposed Soviet emigration law would allow
emigration for virtually anyone who has permission to enter another
country and no outstanding obligations, criminal charges or recent
knowledge of state secrets in the Soviet Union.
   It would also set a basic limit of five years on the length of
time a citizen can be kept from emigrating because of access to
secrets.
   Complete details of the proposal are not known. But the bill,
which was given preliminary approval by the Supreme Soviet in
November, codifies many changes already put into practice in the
Soviet Union.
   The procedures required to obtain travel documents and permission
to emigrate have already been eased a great deal in the last two
years, releasing a flood of visitors and emigrants across the Soviet
borders.
   Soviet officials acknowledge that the main obstacles to travel
have become the heavy workloads of emigration authorities, shortages
of plane and train tickets and problems with currency exchange.
   The financially strapped country can ill afford to allocate hard
currency for citizens to spend abroad, officials say. Now, Soviet
citizens are allowed to exchange rubles for about $300 when they go
abroad on a guest or tourist visa.
   Before the current liberalization of travel regulations, tens of
thousands of Jews and other Soviets were refused exit visas,
becoming known as ``refuseniks.'' Their plight brought repeated
censure from the West.
   Because there has been no legal limit on how long a person could
be denied exit on the grounds he knew state secrets, there have been
cases of refuseniks being denied visas for up to 20 years.
   Activists say there are still dozens if not hundreds of
refuseniks, held because of state secrets or because relatives have
refused to sign papers giving them permission to leave.
   But most former refuseniks have left, and less than 1 percent of
applications to emigrate are currently being turned down, according
to visa officials.

<TEXT>
   They were running out of gasoline and
milk but not imagination in Point Roberts, a tiny finger of the
United States whose lifeline was temporarily severed by a western
Canadian truckers' strike.
   Point Roberts, on the tip of a peninsula, can be reached only by
boat or by roads through British Columbia. It's about 25 miles from
the Canada-U.S. border crossing at Blaine, about 100 miles north of
Seattle.
   So when striking truckers set up border blockades on Friday,
gasoline, grocery and other delivery trucks from the United States
couldn't get through to stores that serve its 750 residents.
   A tentative settlement was announced Monday in the strike by
3,000 independent truckers that began May 27. But strikers said it
doesn't meet their pay demands. A vote on the agreement was
scheduled for late Tuesday.
   The blockade was lifted Tuesday morning after Royal Canadian
Mounted Police using a court order cleared the trucks.
   ``Beer trucks are rolling and the milk truck hopefully is en
route,'' said Lisa Jackson, co-owner of Ben's Department Store, a
62-year-old institution that once was Point Roberts' only business.
   At the Marketplace supermarket, manager Mike Schouten said
suppliers were rushing up meat, produce and dairy products.
   ``I will try to carry a little extra on hand, but you can't put
two weeks worth of milk in the cooler,'' Schouten said Tuesday.
   The days without deliveries brought out ``Out of Gas'' signs at
service stations. Schouten was limiting milk to one gallon per
customer.
   ``Some people were hoarding eight to 10 gallons at a time,'' he
said.
   The store had hired private fishing boats to bring limited
supplies of perishable goods and Schouten said he planned to keep
those channels open in case the border closed again.
   ``I'm crossing my fingers and really hoping for the best but when
you're dealing with this type of situation you never know what will
happen,'' he said.
   Point Roberts residents can drive a few miles to the suburbs of
Vancouver, British Columbia, to buy supplies, but the prices are
higher.
   In Point Roberts, gasoline costs half as much as in Canada, and
cigarettes and other products are also generally cheaper, said Cindy
Hammer, another owner of Ben's Department Store. The store ran out
of gas, and many of its customers, on Sunday, she said.
   The local Chevron station closed Saturday and reopened Monday
when owner Jack Graham purchased 9,000 gallons of gasoline from a
Canadian supplier.
   The blockade highlighted the difficulties for town's residents
who live in isolation from the U.S. mainland and have to cross one
border into Canada and another back into the United States to reach
the rest of their country.
   The treaty establishing the 49th Parallel as the border between
Canada and the United States left the tiny town to the United States.
   There is no school, so students are bused across the borders to
Blaine for classes each day.
   Residents rely on tourists, drawn by a beautiful coastline, and
Canadians looking to save money by shopping in the United States.
   ``Some like it and some don't,'' said Postmaster Dean Nelson.
``It gets to them sitting in the (border) lineups.''
   Even local government becomes complicated. Point Roberts is in
Whatcom County. The county seat of Bellingham is about 50 miles and
two borders away.
   ``It took us two years to get a blinking light'' at a busy
intersection, said Shelley Damewood, who works at the post office.
``Now we're trying to get a stop sign.''
   The proposed settlement covering 60 of 180 trucking companies
involved in the dispute was announced Monday by Bryan Williams, the
strike's chief mediator for the government of British Columbia.
   Williams did not disclose terms of Monday's agreement. But Bruce
Butler, a member of the Western Owner Operators Association, which
represents the independent drivers, said it would boost hauling
rates to $35 an hour (Canadian), or $5 less than the strikers sought.

<HEAD>Safety Board Blames Shifting River Bed In Bridge Collapse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal safety officials on Tuesday blamed a
shifting river channel for the 1989 collapse of a Tennessee highway
bridge that killed eight motorists, but investigators said state
officials should have corrected the problem a decade ago.
   The National Transportation Safety Board, expressing concern
about thousands of other bridges throughout the country, also cited
the 54-year-old structure's simple design as a contributing factor
in the April 1, 1989, collapse. The bridge carried the two
northbound lanes of U.S. 51 over the Hatchie River, 45 miles north
of Memphis.
   The board cited the Tennessee Department of Transportation for
failing to evaluate and correct problems found in inspections dating
back to 1979. The river channel has moved 83 feet since the bridge
was constructed in 1936, investigators said.
   The board voted 3-1 on the probable cause and 4-0 on a set of
recommendations to federal and state officials. Board member Jim
Burnett said he would not support the conclusion until further
inspection after missing bridge parts are recovered.
   The board's investigation remains open, said Chairman James
Kolstad, and could be revised if evidence surfaces that points to
further deficiencies in the bridge. Investigators told the board
that bridge parts might be raised from the water in about two weeks.
   Kolstad said Tennessee officials ``need to improve their
inspections and maintenance procedures. They recognized the problem
but they did not evaluate it; they did not take action to correct
the situation,'' Kolstad said.
   He said recent flooding in the South increases the danger of
bridges being undermined.
   ``I'm concerned that some of these bridges may be put back into
service without adequate inspection,'' Kolstad said.
   The board said it was unlikely that a fracture in any of the
concrete columns of the Tennessee bridge triggered the collapse.
   It said the bridge failed ``most likely'' from the deterioration
of timber piles that were originally buried and not designed to be
in water. The fact that the piles were improperly exposed to the
river channel was known as early as 1979, inspectors said.
   The NTSB staff also had blamed the accident partly on
construction of an adjacent bridge in 1974 to carry U.S. 51's
southbound lanes, which their draft report said accelerated the
shift in the river channel. But the board said the collapse would
have occurred eventually, even without the new bridge and deleted
the southbound bridge as a contributing factor.
   The final report said, however, ``Enough information and guidance
was available for the designers of the southbound bridge to have
discovered the natural channel meander of the Hatchie River, and to
have anticipated that further migration would undermine ... the
northbound bridge.''
   The report said the drivers of passenger cars and trucks on the
bridge had no way of avoiding the accident. It also said emergency
crews could have done nothing more to reduce its severity.
   Board members also cautioned Tennessee authorities against
allowing so many exemptions to vehicle weight restrictions on
bridges _ about 70 a month for the Hatchie bridge before it
collapsed _ and called for closer scrutiny of overweight trucks and
their impact on bridge safety.

<HEAD>Government Under Pressure to Rescue War Crimes Legislation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government came under fierce pressure Tuesday
to rescue Nazi war crimes legislation thrown out by the House of
Lords.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, facing angry lawmakers in the
House of Commons, said she recognized ``the extremely strong
feelings because of the hideous nature of these crimes.''
   However, she made no commitment to invoke a rarely used
parliamentary act and force the bill through the unelected House of
Lords, which consists of hereditary peers, judges, church leaders
and politicians given lifetime titles. The bill, which would have
allowed prosecution of elderly, suspected war criminals living in
Britain, was passed in the Commons in December. Mrs. Thatcher voted
in favor of the legislation.
   The War Crimes Bill was supposed to become law in July, but the
Lords voted 207-74 on Tuesday to defeat it.
   ``We will be considering very carefully ... how best to proceed
bearing in mind the size of the majority in this House on a free
vote,'' Mrs. Thatcher told lawmakers. ``It may be that the House
itself will wish to discuss the matter.''
   The government's options are to abandon the bill, have the House
of Commons vote on whether to reintroduce it, or simply reintroduce
it in the fall. The government has not revived a bill voted down in
the House of Lords since 1949.
   It is rare for the Lords to vote against proposed legislation.
Traditionally, it revises clauses in legislation but does not reject
outright Commons' bills.
   The Lords' powers are limited to delaying measures for a year and
they could not reject the bill a second time.
   The Simon Wiesenthal Center, which submitted a list of Nazi
suspects to the government in 1986, said it was ``deeply upset'' at
the Lords' vote.
   ``I think it is unthinkable that this country, which suffered so
much at the hands of the Nazis, continues to give a haven to some of
Hitler's worst henchmen,'' said Ephraim Zuroff, head of the Israeli
section of the Los Angeles-based Wiesenthal Center.
   Opponents of the bill in the House of Lords argued that it would
be impossible to hold fair trials after 50 years and that
prosecutions would amount to ``show trials'' of old men and stir up
old hatreds.
   The vote left Britain the only one of the World War II allied
powers without laws to prosecute suspected war criminals.
   ``Australia, Canada and the United States, countries with legal
systems not dissimilar to our own, who do not take second place to
us with regard to human rights, have legislated long ago,''
legislator Sir Bernard Braine declared in the Commons.
   Jewish groups also demanded revival of the bill.
   A government-appointed commission that investigated the
Wiesenthal list of Nazi war criminals recommended speedy
prosecutions for three suspects and said another 124 cases should be
investigated.
   The suspects allegedly helped round up and murder thousands of
Jews in Nazi-occupied Soviet republics.
   The commission kept the suspects' names confidential.
   The only one repeatedly identified in the British media,
Lithuanian-born Antanas Gecas, 74, acknowledges serving in an
auxiliary police battalion, but says he took no part in atrocities
and claims to be the victim of a Soviet smear campaign.
   A $1 million libel suit brought by Gecas, a retired mining
engineer who lives in Scotland, against the Times of London was
settled Tuesday before going to trial in Edinburgh.
   The Times said it had wrongly identified Gecas as an officer of
Hitler's notorious SS and as the member of a specialist murder
squad. The Times said it agreed to make a contribution to Gecas'
legal fees but was not paying him any damages.
   ``I am not only dismayed, I am disgusted,'' said Lord Cocks, a
Labor peer, who supported the bill. ``... the House of Lords has
gratuitously stirred up this constitutional issue of the Lords vs.
the Commons.''
   Lord Mayhew, 74, a leading opponent of the bill, said, ``It's a
good day for the House of Lords. Frankly, I don't think the
government are going to bring it (the bill) forward again.''
   Like many of the lords opposed to prosecution, Mayhew served as
an officer in World War II.
   He helped liberate the Belsen concentration camp as the Nazis
retreated in 1945, saw top Nazis sentenced to death at the postwar
trials in Nuremberg and screened other war criminals for deportation
and death in Communist countries.
   ``I don't regret it,'' he said in the debate Monday night. ``But
it was plain then, plain beyond any doubt, that this grim process of
retribution could not go on forever.''

   King Olav of Norway improved Tuesday from a
stroke that left him suffering from partial paralysis and pneumonia,
his doctors said.
   The national hospital in Oslo upgraded the condition of the
86-year-old monarch to stable on Tuesday.
   Olav suffered a stroke Saturday while in the hospital for
treatment of a mild infection of the pericardium, the sac around the
heart. Well-wishers flooded the palace with flowers, telegrams and
letters.
   The hospital bulletin said new tests showed very limited damage
to his brain from the stroke.
   ``There is still some paralysis in the left side of his body but
there has been even more improvement so that he can, to a certain
extent, move his arm and hand,'' doctors Rolf Nyberg-Hansen and
Erling Brodwell said.
   The hospital statement said the king ``has no fever and his
pneumonia has receded even further. His majesty was able to drink
liquids today.''
   Olav has reigned since 1957.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev returned from the United
States on Tuesday triumphantly bearing trade and arms deals but
facing ethnic bloodshed in Central Asia, an impasse with the Baltic
republics and trouble in the Kremlin.
   In Gorbachev's absence, his nemesis Boris N. Yeltsin was elected
president of Russia, the largest Soviet republic. Yeltsin
immediately called for the resignation of the Soviet Cabinet and a
new constitution that would vastly reduce the powers of the central
government.
   In the distant reaches of Soviet Central Asia, two Turkic groups
clashed Tuesday for the second day along the border between
Uzbekistan and Kirghizia. Authorities declared a state of emergency
and said 11 people were killed.
   Along the Baltic coast, Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene of
the secssionist republic of Lithuania reassured her compatriots that
American sympathizers would try to block Congress from endorsing a
U.S.-Soviet trade deal signed at the summit.
   And within the ancient red brick walls of the Kremlin, the
Supreme Soviet legislature unexpectedly postponed consideration of
the emigration law that President Bush set as a precondition for
implementing the trade pact.
   It was not clear whether the postponement was instigated by
Gorbachev, who warned Sunday that he might curb emigration of Soviet
Jews if they continue to settle on lands occupied by Israel during
the 1967 Mideast War.
   The trade deal, which drew immediate criticism from members of
the U.S. Congress, was an unexpected summit triumph for the Soviet
president.
   Bush had said previously he would not sign the agreement until
Gorbachev lifted the economic sanctions he imposed against Lithuania
after it declared independence March 11. American lawmakers chided
Bush for stretching too far to help Gorbachev, who has left the
sanctions in place and refused to negotiate with Lithuanians until
they suspend their declaration.
   The Soviet leader also has decreed that the other two Baltic
republics, Estonia and Latvia, violated the Soviet Constitution by
taking less bold steps toward independence, but he has not been able
to bring them back into the fold.
   State-run Soviet television and centrally published newspapers
gave blanket coverage to Gorbachev's trip, hailing the agreements he
signed to eliminate superpower chemical weapons and complete a
treaty to slash long-range nuclear arsenals.
   The official media also stressed Gorbachev's personal rapport
with Bush and with the crowds of Americans who cheered and applauded
the Soviet leader at every stop.
   ``What we would like to have a special say about is the
establishing of good personal relations between the Soviet and
American presidents, the importance of which could hardly be
overestimated,'' reported Pravda, the organ of the Communist Party.
   The newspaper, devoting nearly its entire front page to
Gorbachev's U.S. visit, emphasized the ``purely human
compatibility'' evident between Gorbachev and Bush and said it made
it possible ``to create a favorable atmosphere for searching
together and finding constructive solutions.''
   Central television continued its upbeat coverage of Gorbachev's
swing across the United States, showing the Kremlin chief meeting
with a beaming former President Ronald Reagan and bantering with
jubilant American crowds.
   The main evening television new program Vremya opened at 9 p.m.
Tuesday with footage of Gorbachev's presidential airplane touching
down at Vnukovo 2 airport. It then broadcast the speech the Soviet
leader delivered to cheering students in California on Monday.
   In Moscow, the mood of rebellion was spreading to the very center
of Soviet power. The Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian
Federation met in the Kremlin and elected Yeltsin as its president
May 29, the day Gorbachev departed Moscow.
   Gorbachev had opposed Yeltsin's election, saying his plan to
shift economic and political decision-making from the central
government to the Russian republic could lead to the disintegration
of th Soviet Union.
   But Gennady Gerasimov and Vitaly Churkin, spokesmen traveling
with Gorbachev, tried to put the best face on Yeltsin's election,
saying it could help the Soviet leader accelerate the pace of
reforms.
   Gorbachev's latest reform package was foundering during his
absence, as shoppers continued the rush on stores they began after
Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov announced an economic reform
package that would triple the price of bread on July 1 and double
the cost of most other food starting Jan. 1.
   Yeltsin, in a Kremlin news conference Wednesday, called for
Ryzhkov's resignation, criticized the price hikes and demanded
faster transition to a market economy.
   Gorbachev may have a chance to regain the initiative in domestic
affairs in an address he is scheduled to deliver on his trip to the
two houses of the Soviet legislature sometime this week. The day for
the speech has not been announced.

   Lawyer Thomas Root, plucked from the Atlantic
after a mysterious six-hour solo flight during which he was shot,
pleaded guilty in federal court Tuesday to five felony charges of
misrepresenting clients.
   Root faces up to 35 years in prison and $1.25 million in fines.
In North Carolina, a grand jury Monday returned a 455-count
indictment against the Alexandria, Va., communications attorney.
   The federal charges involved five clients who had been seeking
broadcast licenses from the Federal Communications Commission. A
federal grand jury returned a 33-count indictment against Root in
March.
   Root, 37, declined comment after entering his plea at U.S.
District Court. His attorney, Eugene Propper, said Root ``feels he's
getting a lot more attention'' that he otherwise would because of
the July 13 flight.
   Root told authorities that he blacked out during the flight and
that the plane continued on autopilot. However, Navy fighter pilots
who intercepted the flight said they saw Root moving in the cockpit.
   The Cessna 210 crashed into the Atlantic off Bermuda. When Root
was rescued, he had a gunshot wound to his stomach. The wound has
not been explained.
   Root, who in October filed for bankruptcy court protection from
his creditors, has denied that financial and legal troubles were
connected with the flight.
   On Monday, a Nash County grand jury in Raleigh, N.C., returned a
455-count indictment charging Root with securities fraud and other
charges. Also indicted were Sonrise Management Services, Telemedia
Inc. and three other men identified as co-owners of the two
businesses.
   Root handled radio license applications for investors of Sonrise
Management.
   The indictments allege the companies violated securities laws by
not registering securities, failing to register sales agents,
engaging in false and deceptive sales practices and conspiring to
violate securities laws.
   In the federal case, Root on Tuesday admitted giving the FCC a
counterfeit document stating that the Federal Aviation
Administration had approved a proposed Missouri site for a radio
tower.
   He also said he gave a North Carolina client a forged FCC
document indicating its license application had been reinstated and
defrauded another North Carolina client by settling a claim against
a competitor for one-fifth the authorized amount.
   Root pleaded guilty to giving a false document to a New York
client seeking a site on Long Island for a radio station, and
falsely telling another client he would get an FCC application
reinstated when he had sought the dismissal.
   The Columbus, Ga.-based Sonrise Management, which touted
Christian principles in sales literature and issued business cards
inscribed with crosses, went out of business several months ago.
   North Carolina Secretary of State Rufus Edmisten said only a
handful of Sonrise Management investors ever received FCC licenses.
   ``In all, 1,018 people in North Carolina contributed more than $8
million to this organization,'' Edmisten said. ``Nationally, more
than $16 million was invested by people from 25 states.''
   Edmisten said there was little chance investors would recoup
their money.
   Root said in his petition for bankruptcy court protection that he
had $1.6 million in liabilities.

<HEAD>Scientific Sleuth Says He Reveals Piltdown Perpetrator</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scientific sleuths can rest easy. A Queens
College professor says he's solved the decades-old mystery of who
masterminded the 1912 Piltdown Man fraud. And it wasn't Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle.
   The Sherlock Holmes author was one of the more colorful
``suspects'' named over the years as perpetrating a hoax that threw
many paleontologists off the trail of what is now recognized as the
course of human evolution.
   Others included several noted scientists, a counterfeit jeweler
and a philosopher-priest.
   But Frank Spencer, an anthropologist who has worked on the famous
whodunit since the 1970s, said in a telephone interview Tuesday
there was never any proof linking the usual suspects.
   He says diary entries and other information uncovered
independently by himself and Australian historian Ian Langham points
the finger squarely at Sir Arthur Keith, a well-respected English
anatomist.
   The Langham-Spencer theory is laid out in two books to be
published this fall by Oxford University Press. Langham, who worked
at the University of Sydney, died in 1984. His widow asked Spencer
to continue his work.
   Piltdown, a small village in England, made international news in
1912 when a skull and other artifacts were discovered by Sussex
lawyer Charles Dawson in a gravel pit.
   ``It was sensational because it offered a completely different
view of evolution at the time,'' Spencer said.
   For those who believed that humans with already enlarged brains
evolved earlier than had been supposed, the Piltdown Man was supreme
proof. Spencer says Keith, conservator of the Hunterian Museum of
the Royal College of Surgeons who died in 1955, was one of the chief
cheerleaders of the theory before Piltdown was unearthed.
   The discovery was debunked in 1953 when scientists learned the
remains were a human skull only a couple of hundred years old with
an orangutan's jaw joined to it.
   ``The general feeling was it was contrived to bring somebody
down, make someone in the scientific community look silly,'' Spencer
said. ``But if that was the case, why didn't they do that?''
Instead, the theory floated around the scientific community for 41
years.
   ``It makes far more sense when beginning to look at the evidence
that Piltdown was something made to withstand scientific scrutiny.''
   Spencer says the Piltdown bones were stained to make them look
prehistoric and the orangutan teeth were filed down to make them
look more like those of a meat-eating human, a ruse Keith had the
knowledge and wherewithal to accomplish.
   But the crux of the Langham-Spencer proof lies in Keith's
diaries. In them, Spencer says, Keith ``indicates he had information
about the site and events at Piltdown ... information which he
wouldn't have had unless he was an inside member of the group.''
   Spencer said Keith also had met with Dawson a year before the
discovery and again, just several months before.
   ``In reconstructing the Langham thesis and other evidence I
found, I think we've come up with a substantial case,'' Spencer said.
   Others may disagree.
   ``Is this the end of the Piltdown affair?'' Dr. William Ball, a
former keeper of paleontology at the British Museum, said when asked
by The New York Times to respond to Spencer's claims.
   ``Until such time as an unequivocal, signed and detailed
confession comes to light, and one that can be shown to fit the
facts as we now know them, I rather doubt it.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev Visit a PR Triumph, But No Quick Fix for Soviet People</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>

   It was another stunning public relations
triumph for Mikhail S. Gorbachev abroad: He won a trade deal, some
bank credits and new friends in business.
   But Gorbachev's weeklong visit to North America yielded no quick
fix for the Soviet economy and won't translate soon into tangible
improvements in the lives of a frustrated and angry Soviet people.
   ``Changing a system means changing people, intelligent people,''
Gorbachev told business executives in Minnesota. ``It's not just
some kind of layout that you see on a piece of paper and you can
just tear up that piece of paper. A system is people, people who
live, people who have their own interests, who have their own
lives.''
   He acknowldged also that people are afraid of change, which he
said is why the first five years of perestroika have had such
limited results.
   Referring to his signing of a new trade pact with President Bush
in Washington, Gorbachev said the agreement to establish normal
trade ties ``is of great political importance.''
   But he said it will not have much practical effect ``right now,
for the period of transition'' to a market economy.
   What's more, Bush made very clear during the summit last week
that he will not send the trade agreement to Congress for approval
until the Soviet Union passes a new emigration law liberalizing
restrictions on Soviet citizens who wish to leave the country.
   The Supreme Soviet legislature Tuesday put off further
consideration of the emigration bill at least until its next
session, which begins in September. And even if Gorbachev gets the
issue back on the calendar, U.S. congressional leaders have said
they intend to tie passage of the trade bill to settlement of the
Lithuanian crisis, an even thornier dispute over the Baltic
republic's declaration of independence from Soviet rule.
   During Gorbachev's overnight stop in Ottawa at the start of his
trip across North America, Canada agreed to extend a $500 million
line of credit to the Soviet Union over the next two years to help
the Soviets purchase Canadian technology and consumer goods.
   But last year, when the Soviets decided to spend substantial
hard-currency reserves to buy consumer goods abroad in order to show
the Soviet people some tangible benefits of reform, the
transportation system broke down, and trainloads of such
hard-to-find items as toothpaste and laundry soap stacked up on the
border because there was no place to unload them.
   Now, in a classic demonstration of the failure of central
planning, the logjam has broken and a glut of imported detergent is
stacked on otherwise empty store shelves.
   Gorbachev repeatedly mentioned during his trip the signing of an
agreement with Chevron Corp. to help explore and develop the vast
Tengiz oil field in a joint venture with the Soviet government. The
field is believed to contain more than twice the petroleum reserves
of Alaska's great Prudhoe Bay.
   But Chevron officials, having already learned the difficulties of
doing business with the Soviet Union in a much smaller and less
ambitious project, say they expect long and complicated negotiations
before any work begins.
   And it will be years before the Soviet economy or the American
oil company begins to reap any reward.
   A central theme of Gorbachev's visit was that he wants to improve
the climate in the Soviet Union for Western business. He not only
encouraged captains of industry to invest their capital in his
country and cited concessions his government has made to encourage
them, he warned that if they don't move now, their reluctance will
be remembered later.
   ``You're wondering could involvement with the Soviet Union become
a trap, could you lose money as a result,'' Gorbachev said. Seeking
to reassure them, he said, ``Risk is good both in politics and
business, but adventurism is bad in both.''
   ``The current Soviet leadership is in favor of profound changes,
but still it fully intends to do that in a careful way,'' he said.
   The Soviet president reminded Americans that market systems have
been evolving in Western countries for centuries, and he is trying
to put one in place practically overnight.
   He could offer no guarantee that the troubled climate will clear
anytime soon.
   The reforms already introduced have so upset the old system, he
said, ``our ship has lost anchor, and therefore we're all a little
sick.''

   Dianne Feinstein and John Van de Kamp brawled to the wire for one
of 1990's biggest political prizes, the Democratic nomination for
governor of California, and voters set lineups Tuesday for fall
contests in eight other states.
   The busiest primary night so far this campaign year saw North
Carolina Democrats deciding whether former Charlotte Mayor Harvey
Gantt or county prosecutor Mike Easley would get the formidable task
of challenging Republican Sen. Jesse Helms.
   Gantt was bidding to become the first black nominated for U.S.
Senate in North Carolina this century.
   ``I'm ready to get into this fight'' with Helms, Gantt said as he
cast his own ballot. ``I'm ready to get it on with him.''
   Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco, and Van de Kamp,
the state attorney general, have spent millions of dollars battling
each other and now the winner will plunge into an even more costly
and just as nasty general election race against Republican Sen. Pete
Wilson. He is trying to keep the California governor's office in GOP
control.
   Voters also were choosing nominees in New Jersey, Alabama, Iowa,
South Dakota, Montana, New Mexico, and Mississippi.
   As usual, California voters also were making decisions on ballot
propositions, including two that would strip the legislature of most
of its power to redraw legislative, including congressional,
district lines. California is likely to gain six U.S. House seats as
a result of the 1990 Census.
   Another California ballot proposal would double the gasoline tax
over the next five years and was being watched as a signal of a
shift in sentiment in the state where the anti-tax revolt began in
the 1970s.
   Seven senators and three governors were on ballots, none with
serious primary opposition.
   The senators were Democrats Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Howell
Heflin of Alabama, Max Baucus of Montana and Tom Harkin of Iowa. The
Republicans were Larry Pressler of South Dakota, Pete Domenici of
New Mexico and Thad Cochran of Mississippi.
   Long in advance of their formal nomination in the primary, Harkin
and Republican Rep. Tom Tauke began campaigning against each other
in what looks like one of the tightest Senate races of the year.
   Alabama Republican Bill Cabannis was geared to challenge Heflin
and Democrat Ted Muenster was taking on Pressler in South Dakota.
   In Montana, Lt. Gov. Allen Kolstad and businessman Bruce Vorhauer
were the leading contenders for the Republican nomination to
challenge Baucus.
   Scores of primaries also were deciding the lineups for elections
to the House. One incumbent who faced a strong challenge was
Democratic Rep. Jim Bates of San Diego, who was rebuked by the House
Ethics Committee for sexual harassment of women employees.
   One of the hottest primaries for a congressional seat was in the
New Jersey district represented by James Courter, the unsuccessful
GOP candidate for governor in 1989. Courter is not seeking
re-election to the House and the Republican contenders to succeed
him include Assemblyman Rodney Frelinghuysen, state Sen. Richard A.
Zimmer and professional football player Phil McConkey.
   Marguerite Chandler was unopposed for the Democratic nomination.
   Gov. Guy Hunt of Alabama, the first Republican elected to that
office this century, was bidding for a second term and a crowded
field of Democrats was vying to challenge him.
   Former Gov. Fob James, educator-lobbyist Paul Hubbert, Rep.
Ronnie Flippo, and Attorney General Don Siegelman were the leading
contenders. No one was expected to get the clear majority needed to
avoid a June 26 runoff.
   In a race in which abortion was a major issue, Iowa Democrats
were choosing among Attorney General Tom Miller, House Speaker Don
Avenson and banker John Chrystal for the nomination to challenge
Republican Gov. Terry Branstad.
   Avenson and Chrystal support the pro-choice position, while
Miller and Branstad are abortion opponents.
   Republican Gov. Garrey Carruthers of New Mexico was ineligible to
seek re-election. Four Democrats, including former Gov. Bruce King,
and four Republicans were competing to succeed him. The next
governor will be the first allowed to serve two consecutive
four-year terms.

   South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson had no GOP primary opposition
as he seeks a second term. In November he will face former
Democratic state Sen. Bob Samuelson.
   Contrary to political tradition, President Bush and other top GOP
officials have not hesitated this year to intervene in party
primaries on behalf of candidates they believe would run strongest
against Democrats in the fall.
   The White House helped persuade Wilson _ who didn't need much
persuading _ to enter the California governor's race a year after he
won a $13 million campaign for re-election to the Senate.
   Control of the governor's office in California is the highest
priority for the leaders of both national parties.
   After the 1980 Census, Democrats had complete control of the
redistricting process in the state and Republicans claim it cost
them at least five U.S. House seats.
   Wilson already has $3.5 million in his campaign bank account and
there is speculation the GOP will spend close to $20 million in the
race to succeed Republican Gov. George Deukmejian, who decided
against seeking a third term.
   The White House recruited Kolstad to take on Baucus in Montana,
but the effort backfired when three other Republicans also entered
the race.
   The latest round of primaries saw no change in the issues mix
that has marked other races this year. Nor was there any diminution
in the negative tone of campaign commercials.
   The roughest rhetoric was in the Feinstein-Van de Kamp race and
it left some Democrats concerned about prospects for uniting the
party in time for the fall campaign.
   The death penalty, abortion and the environment were common
themes.
   In Iowa, the National Abortion Rights Action League endorsed
Avenson out of concern that a Democratic primary victory by Miller
would mean the choice in November would be between two abortion foes.
   Feinstein and Van de Kamp argued over which was more reliably
pro-choice.
   Van de Kamp campaigned over the weekend with Norma McCorvey, who
was the ``Jane Roe'' in the Supreme Court's landmark abortion
decision. McCorvey endorsed the California attorney general because
``I trust John Van de Kamp to defend the right I fought so hard to
win.''
   Feinstein countered that as a woman she would be the most
reliable guardian of the pro-choice position.

<HEAD>Bush Aide Says U.S. Making Progress In Improving Environment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental adviser to President Bush said
Tuesday that the nation has made remarkable progress in improving
the environment over the past two decades ``but we have a long, long
way to go.''
   Michael Deland, chairman of the president's Council on
Environmental Quality, said the next major strides in improving the
environment will depend on industries voluntarily preventing
pollution because doing so is in their economic interest.
   The government should not walk away from ensuring that industry
complies with environmental laws, Deland told reporters, but he
added that ``pollution prevention will not happen by federal or any
other level of government fiat.''
   Instead, industries and businesses will find ways to reduce
pollution because it will be economically beneficial to do so, said
Deland, a former regional administrator for the Environmental
Protection Agency.
   Deland made his remarks in releasing the Council on Environmental
Quality's annual report, which this year reviewed environmental
progress made over the last 20 years.
   The 494-page report, which the government sells for $17, provides
a generally upbeat review of the country's environmental record
since 1970. The document suggested that while environmental problems
persist, ``remarkable improvements'' have been made in some areas
such as overall air quality.
   It noted, however, that progress in dealing with pollution in
major cities and the protection of wetlands and coastal waters has
come slowly.
   The summary did not deal significantly with such concerns as
global warming and the destruction of the ozone layer by manmade
pollution, which are relatively new areas of environmental concern.
   Deland, whose appointment to the president's council was hailed
by environmentalists, said a review of the last 20 years show the
time ``has been largely a period of success.''
   He acknowledged, however, that there are major environmental
problems yet to be addressed.
   ``We are less energy efficient than are the West Germans and the
Japanese. We produce more waste, both hazardous and solid, than any
other country. ... We recycle at a deplorable rate _ less than 10
percent, the West Germans close to 40 percent and the Japanese
approaching 50,'' he said.
   ``We have without any question,'' he continued, ``a long, long
way to go and we recognize that.''

<HEAD>Judge Won't Dismiss Any McMartin Molestation Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the McMartin Pre-School
molestation case on Tuesday refused to dismiss any of the charges in
defendant Raymond Buckey's retrial, saying there was no double
jeopardy.
   Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg acknowledged that some
testimony may not have matched exactly the charges against him. But
he said the accounts by three young girls provided sufficient
evidence to justify continuing the trial.
   Defense arguments concerning inconsistencies in testimony can be
made to the jury when the case is submitted for decision, the judge
said.
   Under the Constitution, people cannot be subjected to double
jeopardy _ being tried a second time on charges for which they wre
found innocent. But people can be tried a second time if there is a
mistrial rather than an acquittal.
   Buckey's attorney, Danny Davis, argued that the counts on which
Buckey was being retried must be presented in the same way as they
were in the first trial or it isn't really a retrial, but ``a
completely distinct and novel trial proceeding.''
   He sought dismissal of five of the eight counts by arguing the
testimony didn't match the allegations detailed in the charges.
   But the judge said, ``I don't find there is a double jeopardy
problem. I find this is an erroneous analysis of double jeopardy.''
   In the case of one child who testified, Davis said, the
prosecution alleged she was molested while seated on Buckey's lap
during a ``horsey game.'' On the stand, the child said Buckey was
lying prone on the floor and she was on top of him. She denied she
was seated on his lap.
   Another child specifically denied being raped and sodomized with
a foreign object, Davis noted, although she alleged other acts of
molestation. The other acts are not specified in the charges.
   The 32-year-old Buckey is being retried on eight molestation
charges unresolved by the jury at his first trial _ the longest and
costliest criminal case in U.S. history.
   The first Buckey trial ended in January with Buckey acquitted of
40 counts of molestation and his mother acquitted of 12 charges. But
the jury deadlocked on 13 counts against Buckey, and the district
attorney decided to retry him on eight of those charges involving
three girls, now 12 and 13 years old.
   The girls have testified to assorted acts of molestation but
pleaded poor memories on events that are alleged to have occurred
when they were toddlers.
   The McMartin case has been in the courts for seven years.
Initially seven defendants, all staff at the now-defunct school,
faced molestation charges. Buckey, a former aide at the school, is
the remaining defendant.
   The prosecution rested its case in the second trial Friday after
only three weeks of testimony from 12 witnesses, the majority of
them children and parents.

   When an Amtrak engine slammed into Gifford
Austin in his '83 Buick on Tuesday, Gifford was able to walk away,
the car suffered some damage to a fender _ and the locomotive was
dead in its tracks.
   Austin, 69, who lives in Peekskill, said he had left his wife at
the train station and was driving home when he found himself trapped
between crossing gates on the tracks.
   He said the gates had risen to let him cross, but then came down
around his car when he was on the tracks.
   Then the five-car train came bearing down at 44 mph, police said.
   Austin said he hard no warning and was unable to get out of the
car in time. But after the impact, which pushed the car a distance,
he walked away and the two golden retriever puppies who were with
him were OK, too.
   His car's front fender was damaged.
   The locomotive, however, had to be towed away. The turbo-charged
train, which is supposed to be one of the most sophisticated and
powerful, ended up with a damaged transmission.
   The 155 passengers heading to Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan
had to board another train.
   There were no injuries. Traffic wasn't affected on the
Metro-North Commuter railroad, which shares tracks with Amtrak.
   Metro-North spokesman Dan Brucker said train-car collisions
usually leave the car obliterated and the train barely nicked.
   He said the cause of the accident was being investigated.

<HEAD>Sihanouk Says Cambodian Accord Will Leave Khmer Rouge Alone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk
said the agreement he signed Tuesday with the government will leave
the Communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas fighting alone.
   The accord, which fell short of a hoped-for cease-fire in
Cambodia's civil war, ended a two-day Tokyo peace conference.
   The accord said a so-called Supreme National Council, comprised
of guerrilla and government representatives, should be formed by the
end of July, the same month a timetable for a cease-fire should be
established.
   Sihanouk called the talks a ``50 percent success.'' The powerful,
Communist Khmer Rouge, part of a three-faction rebel coalition
headed by Sihanouk, boycotted the sessions.
   The group declined to join the conference unless it was an equal
member in the two-sided talks, rather than a part of Sihanouk's
resistance coalition. Japanese officials said the Khmer Rouge also
refused to sign any accord that linked a cease-fire with the
proposed governing body.
   ``The Khmer Rouge was ready to accept a cease-fire or statements
about the desirability of a Supreme National Council, but not a
linkage between them, particularly a time linkage,'' a Foreign
Ministry official said on condition of anonymity.
   A second Foreign Ministry official said Khmer Rouge nominal
leader Khieu Samphan ``had a rather limited mandate'' for the talks.
``Anything beyond that mandate he had great trouble accepting.''
   The conference was heralded as a stepping-stone to a Cambodia
peace conference set for Paris in July.
   The final documents arrived late for the signing ceremony Tuesday
evening, drawing an apology from Masaharu Kohno, a Southeast Asia
division chief in the Foreign Ministry.
   Sihanouk signed the communique with Hun Sen, premier of the Phnom
Penh government, and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama acted
as chairman. The two Cambodians embraced, then drank a champagne
toast to peace in Cambodia.
   At a news conference, Sihanouk said fighting would continue in
Cambodia, but not involving the guerrilla force headed by his son,
Prince Ranariddh, or that of his conservative partner, former
Premier Son Sann.
   ``From now on, the Ranariddhists and the Son Sannists will stop
fighting,'' he said. ``I can predict that there will be continuation
of war in my country between the Khmer Rouge on one side and the
Viets and Hun Sennians on the other.''
   But a Thai official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it
was one thing for Sihanouk to say his forces should stop and another
thing for the commanders in the field to heed the call.
   Western observers in Bangkok have long noted a division between
Cambodian political figures like Sihanouk, who spend little time in
the field and live comfortably elsewhere, and their followers who
have a steady flow of munitions to use as they see fit.
   Fighting was reported to be increasing in Cambodia before the
Tokyo conference started.
   If Sihanouk's prediction is borne out, the Chinese-backed Khmer
Rouge would be isolated on the battlefield as well as in
international opinion. Many have rejected the idea of the Khmer
Rouge participating in any future government.
   During the Khmer Rouge's 1975-79 rule hundreds of thousands of
people were killed, or died of starvation. The group was ousted by
the Vietnamese.
   The Khmer Rouge is militarily the strongest guerrilla faction
fighting the Phnom Penh government, installed by Hanoi.
   The 67-year-old Sihanouk has headed the resistance since 1982. He
says the Khmer Rouge killed five of his children but still believes
the group's force is the strongest barrier to Vietnamese
encroachment on Cambodia.
   The Sihanouk-Hun Sen communique calls for all factions to use
``voluntary self-restraint'' on force, to refrain from offensive
actions and to impose a military standstill.
   The Khmer Rouge said in a statement it was ready to attend the
Paris conference.

   Here is the text of the communique signed Tuesday by
Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Cambodian
Premier Hun Sen. It was issued in English.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The delegation of H.R.H. Samdech Norodom Sihanouk and the
delegation of H.E. Mr. Hun Sen met in Tokyo June 4-5, 1990, to
discuss various issues, with a view to achieving the earliest
solution to the Cambodian problem. After intensive deliberations,
both sides agreed on the following points.
   1. An urgency of implementing a voluntarily self-restraint use of
force by all factions.
   2. Actual cease-fire must be implemented as a step toward the
pending acceptable solution. Furthermore, such undertaking can be
realized through a cessation of hostilities and the agreement on the
creation of a Supreme National Council (SNC).
   3. It is essential for all factions to refrain from all offensive
actions including all military operation during the transitional
period. This will include a clarification of measures to ensure
military standstill and military in place. Such measures would at
least ensure that the troops under control remain in their
respective positions and refrain from any actions which lead to an
extension of territory.
   4. The Paris International Conference on Cambodia shall be called
upon, with a proper participation of the U.N., to take necessary
measures to monitor, supervise and verify the withdrawal of all
foreign forces and the cessation of all foreign military assistance,
including an implementation of a cease-fire agreement. These
measures should be functioned through the ICM.
   5. The establishment of an SNC is essential in order to symbolize
Cambodia's neutrality, national sovereignty and national unity
following the agreement in the Joint Communique signed by H.R.H.
Samdech Norodom Sihanouk and H.E. Hun Sen on Feb. 21, 1990, in
Bangkok. The SNC shall be composed of equal numbers of prominent
personalities from both parties to represent all shades of opinions
among the people of Cambodia. The SNC shall be convened and chaired
in its first meeting by a member chosen by the SNC.
   6. Both sides represented at the Tokyo Meeting hereby declare
that the historic monument of Angkor is a non-hostility area. Both
sides welcome international community to enlarge its scope of
cooperation for the preservation and restoration of this common
heritage of mankind.
   Done and signed by both sides on the Fifth Day of June Nineteen
Ninety.

   The ship's slip was nixed.
   The Keewaydin State Park where the Cashettes had left their names

a slip for their 42-foot boat.
   It was great news for the couple who had kept their boat _ and
the two they've bought since _ in private marinas.
   Then, the couple told the marina operator from Keewaydin near
Alexandria Bay about their new 42-foot boat.
   Sorry, said the marina operator. At the start of the week, the
marina stopped taking anything longer than 36 feet.
   At Keewaydin, which sits on the St. Lawrence River, the marina
has 275 people waiting for about 125 slips. That's up from 133
people waiting last year. The top three people signed up in 1980.

<HEAD>Lugar Sees Floor Fight With Democrats Over Farm Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, ranking Republican on the
Senate Agriculture Committee, said Tuesday he would not compromise
with the Democrats to raise target prices and loan rates in the 1990
farm bill.
   He also said he was not willing to take more acreage out of
production or accept shifts in finances to create the illusion of
deficit reduction without real cuts.
   ``I've been infinitely flexible in other things (in the bill),''
he said. But he said these four areas were not negotiable and would
lead to a floor fight if the Democratic majority on the committee
insists in keeping them in the bill.
   ``The Democrats have to decide, `Do we want an issue or do we
want a bill?''' said Lugar. ``If an issue is what they want, then my
guess is we will have a one-year extension.''
   Congress passes a farm bill every five years to set agriculture
policy, including the degree to which the federal government will
subsidize farmers through target prices and loan rates.
   Current law expires in December, but the Bush administration has
said repeatedly that it would accept a one-year extension of
existing policies.
   That is viewed by many in Congress as a strategy that would help
U.S. negotiators at international trade talks at which the United
States is trying to get other countries to remove subsidies from
agricultural products that distort world market prices.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who is actively involved
in those talks, has said that U.S. subsidies may have to be adjusted
to comply with whatever agreement develops.
   Lugar mentioned the trade talks in a session with reporters, but
said his main objection to the Democrats' proposal for increasing
target prices is budgetary.
   ``At a time when it is fairly likely people may be asked to pay
more taxes, for the farm program to be asking for more money is not
prudent,'' he said.
   Lugar said, however, he did not know for sure if a tax increase
was going to be proposed by President Bush or congressional leaders
who are discussing solutions to the government's spending problems.
   Lugar's comments preceded a meeting of a Senate Agriculture
Committee task force that is trying to compromise the Republican and
Democratic proposals on price supports.
   The Democrats want to increase target prices 1 percent with other
increases possible in the last four years of the program, depending
on inflation.
   The House Agriculture Committee, meanwhile, has voted to freeze
target prices.

   State lawmakers lined up what they hope
will be high-powered testimony as they begin their to effort write a
law that will reach the U.S. Supreme Court and result in strict
national limits on abortion.
   Award-winning geneticist Jerome Lejeune of the Faculty of
Medicine of Paris is being flown to Baton Rouge for hearings that
start Wednesday. He will testify that life begins at conception.
   His testimony in a Tennessee case was instrumental in a ruling
last year that seven frozen embryos were human beings with
constitutional rights. An appeals court is still considering that
ruling.
   Lejeune achieved international recognition for his discovery of
the genetic roots of Down's syndrome.
   Also scheduled to testify: the daughter of a rape victim and a
former abortion clinic operator ``who has recanted,'' said Rep.
Woody Jenkins.
   Abortion-rights advocates promised a low-key campaign.
   ``We will have more home-grown folks to testify because we don't
want this to be another Vietnam where you bring in outside resources
to fight in our land on this issue,'' said Robin Rothrock, director
of an abortion-rights coalition and president of the state League of
Women Voters.
   The fight shifted to Louisiana after the governor of Idaho vetoed
a restrictive abortion bill that had been written to go to the
Supreme Court.
   Anti-abortion forces hope the court will overturn its 1973 Roe
vs. Wade decision that allowed for abortion.
   Those hopes were roused last year when the court ruled in a
Missouri case that states have some leeway in restricting abortion.
   Although most of the focus in Louisiana was on the scheduled
eight hours of testimony in the House Criminal Justice Committee, a
separate anti-abortion bill was moving through the Senate with less
fanfare.
   A Senate committee approved a bill on Monday that would ban
abortions except to save the mother's life. Violators would face
maximum 10-year prison sentences.
   ``That's like my bill and it's good to have two vehicles,''
Jenkins said. ``But we need extensive hearings on the legal, medical
and social questions to use in the record for our challenge of Roe
vs. Wade. That's what makes the House hearings so important.''
   Rothrock said the hearings are designed to stir emotions, rather
than shed light.
   ``A large part of what is going on at this point is a circus
atmosphere,'' said Rothrock.
   ``The issue is whether these bills amount to a legitimate
challenge to Roe vs. Wade. With no exceptions and with a criminal
penalty, they are blatantly unconstitutional and are not legitimate.
We would be wasting up to $3 million in appeals battles at a time
when this state has a $600 million shortfall.
   ``But, with the Legislature, it may be impossible to overcome the
emotionalism. That means we have a circus and Louisiana will be made
a spectacle.''
   A majority of the House Criminal Justice Committee said it wanted
an amendment making exceptions for rape, incest and to protect the
health and life of the mother.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer, an abortion foe, said he will veto any bill
without those exceptions.

<HEAD>Despite Territorial Dispute, Tokyo Welcomes Soviet-South Korea
Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While South Korea's political and trade relations
with Moscow develop, Japan's ties to the Soviet Union are tied up in
a longstanding dispute over Tokyo's demand for the return of islands
seized by the Soviets in World War II.
   The dispute has prevented the nations from signing a peace treaty
since the war ended in 1945, and it was brought up during the
superpower summit in Washington.
   President Bush told Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan that he
raised the issue with Mikhail S. Gorbachev during their talks,
government spokesman Misoji Sakamoto said.
   But Sakamoto said Gorbachev did not show a forthcoming attitude
on the Kuril Islands, which lie off the northern tip of Japan.
   Meanwhile, Gorbachev ended his U.S. trip Monday by meeting in San
Francisco with President Roh Tae-woo of South Korea. South Korean
officials predicted the unprecedented meeting would lead to
diplomatic ties between Seoul and Moscow, which were on opposite
sides in the Cold War.
   The Soviets are allies with Communist North Korea, South Korea's
archenemy, and they supported the North during the Korean war.
   But economic and political relations have warmed in recent years,
particularly since 1988, when the Soviets participated in the Seoul
Olympics despite a boycott by North Korea.
   Many in Seoul see improved ties with Moscow as a means of easing
tensions with the North.
   Japan on Tuesday also welcomed the Roh-Gorbachev meeting as a way
of contributing to stability on the Korean peninsula.
   ``The summit between the two countries is quite important. We
welcome the meeting itself,'' said acting Foreign Ministry spokesman
Makoto Yamanaka. ``We hope both countries would further relations so
that a relaxation of tension could be obtained on the Korean
peninsula.''
   ``If South Korea could have stable relations with China and the
Soviet Union, that would contribute to the stabilization of the
situation on the Korean peninsula,'' Yamanaka said.
   But he said the North Korean reaction to the talks would be an
important factor in determining the effect of Soviet-South Korean
rapprochement on stability on the peninsula, which was divided into
the Communist North and capitalist South in 1945.
   ``The Japanese government has been trying to engage in a dialogue
with North Korea, but so far hasn't received any favorable response
at all,'' he added.
   On the question of the Kuril Islands, Yamanaka said: ``We haven't
sensed any sign of flexibility from the Soviet side.'' He added,
``Maybe it's too early.''
   The Soviet side has sought increased trade with Japan. But its
efforts have been handicapped by the territorial dispute, coupled
with wariness among Japanese businessmen toward what they view as
risky, often unprofitable investments.
   Soviet officials have suggested their overture to South Korea was
intended to worry Japanese businessmen, who still view the Soviet
Union as a potentially vast market for Japanese goods.
   Japanese officials earlier scoffed at such ideas, saying they
were not desperate enough for investment opportunities to compromise
their stand on the territorial issue.
   Despite the diplomatic standoff, Gorbachev said Sunday that he
planned to visit Japan sometime next year to discuss increasing
economic ties.

   An oral surgeon who waged a bitter court
battle over the right to visit his daughter said Tuesday he has not
stopped fighting to see the child, who now lives in New Zealand with
her mother.
   ``I just feel it's better for her that I don't engage in a
full-blown court battle,'' Dr. Eric Foretich said of his 7-year-old
daughter Hilary. ``Let the immigration officials in New Zealand
decide.''
   ``The case is proceeding in the family court,'' Foretich's New
Zealand attorney, Rodney Hansen, told the New Zealand Press
Association Tuesday night.
   NZPA earlier quoted Foretich as saying he was giving up his
battle and was resigning himself to Hilary living in New Zealand
with her mother, Elizabeth Morgan.
   Morgan, a plastic surgeon, hid Hilary in New Zealand to evade a
Washington judge's 1987 order allowing continued visits by her
father.
   Morgan was imprisoned for 25 months for defying the order. She
has accused her former husband of sexually abusing Hilary, a charge
he strenuously denies.
   Foretich rushed to New Zealand in February to see Hilary for the
first time in three years after learning the child was living in
Christchurch with maternal grandparents.
   Foretich maintains the girl should be returned to the United
States.
   Morgan has sought permanent residence in New Zealand to stay with
her daughter.
   ``Frankly I'm putting my daughter's interest before my own now
and she needs to be out of the paper and out of confrontation,''
Foretich told NZPA.

   A major toy distributor on Tuesday recalled
16,000 musical instruments because the paint on them contains too
much lead.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said New Jersey-based Toys
``R'' Us was voluntarily recalling its multicolored plastic Music
Master Xylophone toys because they contain ``lead in excess of the
allowable limit established by federal law.''
   The instruments were sold nationwide since 1988 and are labeled
``SX-305, SKN 421944, Shinnihon,'' the commission said.
   The agency said also that General Toys of Los Angeles was
recalling approximately 2,400 windup plastic toys because they may
pose both a fatal choking or puncture wound hazard to small children.
   The second recall includes: The Happy Flapping Car, models 8668
and 8228; The Happy Tricycle Police &amp; Thief Motorcycle, model 636;
Cycling Bear, model 6968; Naughty Bear, model 6976 and Ice Cream
Van, model 6973.
   The toys were sold nationwide before March of this year.
   The CPSC said there had been no reports of injuries involving any
of the toys.
   Consumers should take them away from children and return them to
the store where purchased for a refund, officials said.

   Marilyn Quayle said Tuesday that at times
during the 1988 campaign the media made her feel ``very angry and
terribly vulnerable.''
   However, Mrs. Quayle said she had learned much since Dan Quayle
was George Bush's vice presidential running mate.
   ``Let's meet halfway,'' she told an audience of reporters at the
National Press Club. ``I only ask for fairness and accuracy.''
   Mrs. Quayle said the campaign was a ``baptism by fire for all the
Quayles.''
   ``Before it was all over, I felt a least a little singed,'' she
said. ``It hurt reading stories or seeing reports about a man
bearing almost no resemblance to the one I love deeply.
   ``At times I felt misunderstood, misrepresented, very angry and
terribly vulnerable,'' she said.
   During the campaign, Mrs. Quayle bristled but spoke little except
to defend her husband against what she said were unfair attacks,
including questions about his decision to join the National Guard
during the Vietnam War and his academic performance.
   ``I put on my armor to do battle for my family, and in the
process I froze some of you out,'' she said. ``I regret that. Chalk
it up to inexperience or to protectiveness.''
   Asked why she decided to talk about the campaign, she said: ``I
was hoping that this talk would put it all to rest.
   ``Every interview I give ... every place I go, I get the same
questions _ it's all about the campaign and what we went through in
our trial by fire. And I really wanted to move on,'' she said.
   She said that while she was hurt by some of the coverage of her
husband, ``the vice president and I are never people to lay back and
let folks trod on us. We fight back, and we fought back as best we
knew how.''
   Mrs. Quayle said her husband has ``done a fabulous job'' since he
took office and ``I'm having the time of my life.''
   She said she doesn't want to dwell on the past.
   ``I want to move forward with the things that are important ...
and not talk any more about what I really think was an ugly chapter
in journalism and an ugly chapter in my own personal life,'' she
said.

   Israeli soldiers shot and killed an 8-year-old
Arab boy Tuesday during a confrontation in a West Bank refugee camp
and a 14-year-old Palestinian in the nearby city of Nablus, local
reports said.
   Troops clamped curfews on Nablus and the Askar refugee camp after
the shootings.
   The army confirmed a boy from the Askar Camp was killed when
troops fired rubber bullets at Palestinian stone-throwers, but said
the boy was 10, not eight.
   The army spokesman's office said the military commander in
Nablus, the West Bank's largest town, was investigating the
circumstances.
   The victim, Ahmad Salama, died at Al Ittihad Hospital in Nablus
after being struck by a rubber bullet that penetrated his skull,
hospital officials said.
   The fatality quickly triggered more unrest in Askar as several
hundred angry Palestinians gathered for the boy's funeral and some
unfurled the outlawed Palestinian flag.
   Soldiers clamped a curfew on the camp of 9,000 to contain the
disturbances, the army said.
   Salama was the second 8-year-old killed in clashes the past month.
   According to the Israeli human rights group Betselem, 43
Palestinian children ages 12 and younger have been killed from the
December 1987 start of the uprising through May 31. It said 110
other youths, ages 13 to 16, have also been killed by Israelis.
   The army claims small children frequently are placed at the front
of Arab protests, while Palestinians accuse the army of firing
without caution and sometimes hitting children who are not
demonstrators.
   In Nablus, a 14-year-old youth was killed Tuesday when troops
encountered a group of masked Arab activists carrying axes.
   Arab journalists said the youths were carrying a loudspeaker and
calling for protests to mark the 23rd anniversary of the start of
the 1967 Middle East War in which Israel captured the West Bank from
Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt.
   Army officials said soldiers ordered the Arabs to stop, fired in
the air and at then at their legs before shooting directly at the
group and killing one of the activists.
   Arab hospital officials identified the youth as 14-year-old Rami
Farid Kamhieh, and said another youth was wounded in the shooting.
   The violent outbreak came as Palestinians held a general strike
throughout the occupied lands to mark the anniversary of Israel's
capture of the terrritories.
   Tuesday's deaths raised to 716 the number of Palestinians killed
during the nearly 30-month-old rebellion against Israeli rule in the
occupied territories.
   At least 218 Palestinians have also been slain by fellow Arabs as
alleged collaborators with Israel. Forty-five Israelis have been
killed in the unrest.
   In Israel, meanwhile, a magistrate's court judge ordered an
Israeli suspected of massacring seven Gazan workers near Tel Aviv
last month held an additional 14 days while an investigation
continues.
   The shooting suspect, Ami Popper, 21, of Rishon Lezion near Tel
Aviv, had been dishonorably discharged from the army. He was turned
in by friends shortly after the attack and is undergoing psychiatric
tests by court order.
   Popper's attorney, David Ofek, contends his client is not
psychologically fit to stand trial.

   Members of Congress sometimes earn speaking
fees at fancy resorts, but a survey of privately financed Senate
trips found Tuesday that the top destination in 1989 was New York
City.
   All told, senators took at least 506 trips last year paid for
with privat funds, primarily to speak before corporate and trade
groups, Public Citizen's Congress Watch said Tuesday.
   There were 44 trips to New York, 28 to Los Angeles, 28 to
Chicago, 19 to West Palm Beach, Fla., and 15 to Miami, according to
the survey of financial disclosure records released last week.
   Other cities frequented often were St. Louis, Dallas, Orlando and
San Francisco. There were nine trips each to Jamaica and Switzerland.
   Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., had the most privately paid
travel last year with 20 trips. He was followed by Sens. Orrin G.
Hatch, R-Utah and James Jeffords, R-Vt., with 14 trips each.
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., had 13 trips, the same as Sen. Charles
Robb, D-Va. Tied with 12 trips were Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del., John
Breaux, D-La., Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, Don Nickles, R-Okla., and
Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.
   Public Citizen found that the groups financing the trips often
invited senators from committees that regulated their industries.
   For instance, Durenberger's 20 trips included 10 with
health-related interests. The Minnesota Republican sits on
subcommittees of the Senate Finance Committee that deal with health
issues.
   The group suggested that congressional travel be financed by the
taxpayers and that free trips from private sources be banned.
   ``Members of Congress should be subject to the same travel rules
as Cabinet secretaries: If a speech is worth making to advance the
public interest, and some of them certainly are, the government
should pay,'' said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook.
   Records for a half-dozen senators could not be checked because
they were granted filing extensions.

   Marion Barry's lawyers said Tuesday they may
call his campaign manager and an indicted former city official as
defense witnesses at the mayor's drug and perjury trial.
   Lawyers and U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson spent the
day in face-to-face questioning of a dozen prospective jurors. Nine
were deemed sufficiently impartial to be sent into a pool from which
a jury will be seated to hear the case against the mayor.
   The nine include an FBI clerk, two lawyers, a government worker,
a journalist, two retirees and a 70-year-old woman who said she
thinks politicians are dishonest.
   One woman, an art teacher at a private school, initially said she
had formed an opinion about the case after Barry's January arrest on
drug charges at a Washington hotel, an incident which forms the
basis of one of the charges.
   But after prolonged questioning, she said she could presume
Barry's innocence and listen impartially to the evidence if she sat
as a juror.
   Barry's lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, said the woman shouldn't be
sent into the jury pool, but the judge rejected Mundy's request.
   Barry joked with reporters as he arrived on a brilliant spring
day, asking one whether he wanted to play tennis. Once inside the
courtroom he chatted with artists, asking them how long it takes to
draw their sketches for television.
   The mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 counts of cocaine
possession, three counts of lying to a grand jury and one count of
conspiracy. The three perjury charges are felonies.
   Mundy said in court that he wanted the name of Anita Bonds,
Barry's campaign manager, added to the list of possible witnesses.
Bonds sat next to Barry at the defense table during much of the
day's proceedings.
   Law enforcement and city government sources have said prosecutors
were on the verge of questioning Bonds when a grand jury indicted
the mayor on May 10. Bonds has said she had not received a subpoena
to testify but was informed by police officials working on the case
that prosecutors wished to speak with her.
   Also added to the list is David Rivers, the former director of
the city's Department of Human Services and a close friend of Barry.
Rivers is currently on trial in the same courthouse, accused of
steering city contracts to friends and business associates.
   Drama was slight in Tuesday's questioning of possible jurors.
   Under questioning from Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts, a
man who works as a chauffeur said his only arrest had been for a
traffic violation.
   Roberts then confronted the man with a document showing he had
been arrested and accused of breaking into a men's clothing store.
The chauffeur said the matter had been ``thrown out'' and said he
had forgotten about the incident.
   ``I never went to court,'' he added.
   Others questioned included a lawyer whose firm represents one of
the government witnesses in the case. The lawyer said she knows
nothing about the firm's representation of the anticipated witness,
James McWilliams, a longtime friend of the mayor.

<HEAD>It's the Law: You'll Have to Bring A Toilet to This Cape Cod Beach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARNSTABLE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you want to spend the day at Sandy
Neck dunes, you'll soon have to pack a portable toilet with your
picnic basket and towel.
   A regulation adopted last month requires sunbathers to bring a
portable toilet. As things are now ``you kind of have to watch where
you step,'' said Brenda Bell, chairman of the governing board for
the Cape Cod beach.
   ``You go to the dunes, when there's no rain, and you can smell
human waste on hot, sunny days in summertime,'' Ms. Bell said.
   Board member Ellen McBarron said the plan was passed as an
environmental measure. She said placing portable toilets on the
six-mile sandspit was not a viable alternative because high tides
would sweep them out into Cape Cod Bay.
   Ms. Bell said 600 vehicles are on the beach each day, plus people
who come to the beach from cottages.
   ``You're talking about a lot of vehicles packed with an average
of five people. Where are they going to go to the bathroom?'' Ms.
Bell said.
   There is some relief for beachgoers, however.
   The new rule won't go into effect until next year because 800
beach passes have already been sold.

<HEAD>Judge Considering Dismissing Secord Libel Suit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal district judge is considering whether
to dismiss a $38 million libel suit filed against two journalists by
Iran-Contra figure Richard V. Secord.
   Lawyer Dean Ringel told Judge George H. Revercombe on Tuesday
that Secord's suit against Leslie and Andrew Cockburn and the
Atlantic Monthly Press should be dismissed because no actual malice
has been proved.
   But W. Michael Kramer, attorney for the former Air Force major
general, contended the authors, in a 1988 book, falsely linked
Secord to narcotics trafficking as part of the effort to finance the
Contra rebels.
   Kramer asked the judge for additional time to take depositions
and search for further evidence in the case.
   Revercombe took both motions under advisement.
   Kramer contended that the clear intent of the book, ``Out of
Control: The Story of the Reagan Administration's Secret War in
Nicaragua,'' was to exploit the Iran-Contra affair by putting the
administration and its key players in the worst possible light.
   But Ringel, appealing for dismissal, said: ``Mr. Secord seems to
assume that since the book takes a political position opposite to
that of the previous administration that is evidence of malice.
   ``One of the consequences of letting this go on is the concern
that this could go on endlessly,'' he said. ``Every nook and cranny
of the Iran-Contra affair becomes open for discussion. There's no
need for that.''
   Kramer said Secord's attorneys have no intention of doing that
and want only ``a limited period of focused discovery.''
   Secord's libel suit was filed in March 1988, the same day he was
indicted for his Iran-Contra role.
   He was sentenced to two years probation on one of 12 original
counts after a plea bargain. But he is appealing, alleging that
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh lacked jurisdiction to prosecute
for an offense arising out of Secord's congressional Iran-Contra
testimony.

<TEXT>
   Shaken residents of this tiny mountain
hamlet wept Tuesday near a charred patch of ground outside the town
hall where four men, including a father and two sons, were
electrocuted while moving a flag pole.
   The four men, two of whom served on the town council that met
Monday night, died when the 38-foot pole they were holding fell
against high-voltage power lines.
   Killed were Borough Council president Robert Friend, 59; his sons
Randall Scott Friend, 23, and Robert Friend II, 22; and Councilman
Keith Cuppett, 35, all of Markleysburg, said state Trooper Richard
Veil.
   Many who live in this community of 400 stood along the main route
of town Tuesday, mourning their fallen neighbors. Some walked to the
accident site and several turned away weeping.
   The Rev. Peter A. Malik of Uniontown consoled relatives at the
Friend home in the Fayette County town near West Virginia and
Maryland.
   ``Their last name sort of says it all,'' he said. ``They were
friends to everybody. If you needed a friend, you called a Friend.''
   The men were removing the flagpole from its base for renovations.
   ``They had got a new flag and they were going to paint the
pole,'' said Mary Ann Frazee, a neighbor.
   Many in Markleysburg saw the electrocution.
   Screams from the mother of one victim drew Kathy Lawson to the
scene.
   ``They were still on fire and I held onto his mother to keep her
back,'' said Lawson. ``The whole town was running over to them, but
nobody could get to them because the pole was right over them and
electricity was still running through it.''
   ``It's a loss. It's a great loss,'' said Andy Sember, manager of
the G.W. Superette.
   Robert Friend II worked at the grocery store during high school
and college, Sember said. The market will be closed Thursday, when
funeral services are scheduled.
   The two younger victims recently graduated from nearby California
University of Pennsylvania, Sember said. They had planned to start a
computer business with their 27-year-old brother, Doug, who suffered
minor injuries in the accident.
   The elder Friend worked as a carpenter in Morgantown, W.Va.,
Malik said. His wife, Nancy, works for the same company.
   ``They were very much a team,'' the minister said.
   Malik said he has known the Friend family for more than seven
years through a youth ministry organization.
   ``I think they're just going to lean on the Lord Jesus Christ and
let him handle it,'' he said. ``All of them have very strong
Christian faith, the kind that goes beyond Sunday morning and is
practiced all week long.''
   Cuppett lived across from the town hall with his wife, Linda, who
also is a council member. She was home when the accident occurred.

<HEAD>Conservationists Claim a Victory in Protecting Elephant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. market for ivory has virtually
collapsed since President Bush banned imports a year ago to help
protect the African elephant, and sales have dropped in some other
countries, the World Wildlife Fund said Tuesday.
   But the group was worried that ivory carvers may turn to using
hippopotamus teeth and suggested instead that they ply their art on
the tusks of extinct mammoths being dug from the frozen tundra of
Siberia.
   Bush announced a moratorium on ivory imports June 5, 1989, and
Japan, the world's biggest market for ivory, has also been enforcing
a ban.
   ``Dealers report that wholesale prices for jewelry and simple
carvings, which historically accounted for most of the U.S. market,
have been discounted by 40 to 70 percent,'' the Wildlife Fund's
report said.
   ``One major ivory trader on New York stated firmly that price is
irrelevant in the current U.S. market, since demand does not
exist,'' the report said.
   Results in other areas are mixed but the report saw encouragement
for the fund's efforts. It estimated that Africa's elephant
population went down from 1,194,331 in 1981 to about 610,000 last
year.
   One substitute for elephant ivory: the tusks of pre-historic
mammoths dug up by the Soviet Union.
   ``We don't try to protect the mammoth _ it's been extinct for
10,000 years,'' said Michael Sutton, one of the authors of the
report.
   He said he was more concerned about carvers who are shifting to
hippopotamus teeth. A lot of hippos have to be killed to get the
same weight in teeth as comes from the tusks of one elephant.
   ``In 1989 Japan imported about 1,991 kilograms (4,380 pounds) of
mammoth ivory and 1,235 kilograms (2,717 pounds) of hippo teeth,''
the report said.
   ``The declared value of hippo teeth is about $60 per kilogram
(2.2 pounds) mammoth ivory is valued at $180 to $240 per kilogram,
according to Japanese customs data.''
   One price that has been going up: plectra for the samisen.
According to the report, the strings of this Japanese instrument are
played with a pick that must be carved from a raw tusk weighing at
least 57 pounds. That size is rare these days as poachers turn to
younger and younger elephants.
   In Hong Kong the report said the number of ivory shops has
declined and up to 75 percent of the carvers have found other jobs.
The government has promised them a subsidized course in carving ox
bones.
   China refused to go along with an internationally agreed ban, but
the report said the ivory trade there has nearly collapsed and the
number of carvers has gone down. It quoted U.S. government sources
as saying that the Chinese government may ban ivory imports from
Africa.
   But South Korea imported 28.8 tons of carved ivory in 1989, more
than in the previous five years combined. The report suggests
traders may have established the country as a new carving center or
a base for smuggling.
   Illegal slaughter of elephants was reported to have declined
considerably in Kenya, the Central African Republic and Gabon,
though not in Malawi or Tanzania.
   ``The poacher is at the low end of chain,'' said Sutton. ``It
takes a while for the effect of lower prices to trickle down to
him.''
   The report pointed out that Africans in the elephant areas are so
poor that even $1 to $5 a kilogram may be an attractive price.

<BYLINE>Colombia to Continue Drug Fight

   Outgoing Colombian President Virgilio Barco on
Tuesday promised that his successor will continue the fight against
narcotics trafficking and asked U.S. backing for his efforts.
   Barco, who leaves office Aug. 7, met with Bush in the Oval Office
for 40 minutes and told reporters later that his drug-plagued nation
will continue its efforts to stop the flow of cocaine northward.
   ``We will continue that because we believe in that. And the next
president of Colombia, the president-elect, also has been ...
stating that he would continue to fight drugs, and I'm sure that he
will receive the backing of the United States,'' he said.
   Barco, who has met with Bush several times on the issue of
illegal narcotics, was prohibited by the country's constitution from
seeking re-election. He came to the United States to give the
commencement address at Massachusetts Institute of Technology on
Monday.
   Barco's successor, Cesar Gaviria, was the only candidate in last
month's election to take a hard-line stand against drug traffickers
who use Colombia as a major processing and transport center. Gaviria
has complained that Colombians are dying in the drug wars while
other nations do little.
   In his victory speech, Gaviria called on developed countries to
cut cocaine consumption and to work harder to control arms
trafficking and money-laundering by cocaine traffickers.
   He also said the United States to drop trade impediments against
Colombian exports and to increase aid to his country.
   Barco, in his meeting with Bush, also raised trade questions,
said White House spokesman Bill Harlow.
   Gaviria has said exports likes coffee and flowers should receive
preferential treatment, but Harlow said Barco did not directly raise
the coffee or flower issue.
   After the meeting, Barco brushed aside questions on flowers and
coffee agreements, indicating those were matters yet to be resolved.
   He said little about the meeting except that it was pleasant and
that they ``talked about the cooperation that Colombia needs.''
   However, the Colombian embassy had released a statement urging
the United States to take the lead in restoring an international
coffee cartel, whose collapse last year without U.S. support has led
to a drop in coffee prices cost the Colombian government more than
$500 million in 1989, according to the Colombians.
   The 74-nation International Coffee Agreement abandoned production
quotas for member nations in July when the United States withdrew.
   The United States had complained that some coffee-growing nations
taking part in the agreement sold coffee surpluses secretly to East
bloc nations at lower prices than those charged in the United States.
   U.S. officials also wanted an increase in export quotas for
higher-quality coffees sought by American consumers, a position
favored by many Central American countries growing those grades who
were unhappy with what they saw as overly restrictive production
quotas.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, chairman of the Select Committee on
Narcotics Abuse, said in a statement Bush must do more to address
Colombia's requests on such matters as the coffee agreement and
banning U.S. exports of weapons popular with drug lords.
   ``If we want to see this battle continue we will have to give
more than moral support for courage,'' Rangel said. ``We will have
to address the specific requests of the elected Colombian leaders.''
   Harlow said Bush briefed Barco on his recent summit meeting with
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

<TEXT>
   Rebels seized the headquarters of the
world's largest rubber plantation on Tuesday, then gathered for
action at the adjoining gates of Liberia's international airport,
plantation sources said.
   President Samuel Doe pursued a last-stand attempt at peaceful
negotiations to end a six-month insurgency that has evolved into a
tribal war. He met with Christian church officials and Moslem
leaders who have offered to act as intermediaries.
   In Akron, Ohio, a spokesman for the Bridgestone@Firestone Inc.
company that runs the 120,000-acre plantation referred to the rebels
as ``freedom fighters'' and said the company wants to keep the
plantation operating _ even with rebels.
   Insurgents now control every major industrial concern in this
West African country of 2.5 million residents, except possibly the
Bong iron ore mine, cut off for days from Monrovia and believed
behind rebel lines.
   Plantation residents said rebels fired mortars and automatic
weapons Tuesday as dozens crossed the Farmington River _ the last
natural barrier before Monrovia _ and moved onto the plantation. One
shell fell into the garden of an expatriate plantation employee, but
no one was hurt, the sources said.
   Robertsfield International Airport, 25 miles from Monrovia, was
built to serve the plantation. It was effectively closed on Monday.
   Off Monrovia, four U.S. warships carrying 2,000 Marines remained
ready to evacuate Americans and other foreigners. State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Monday in Washington that about
70 U.S. officials and 1,200 private American citizens remained in
Liberia.
   Most of the rebels belong to Liberia's Gio and Mano tribes and
entered Liberia from neighboring Ivory Coast in late December. Doe
belongs to the Krahn tribe, which is loyal to him, as is the
Mandingo tribe.
   The rebels accuse Doe's administration of corruption, economic
mismanagement and human rights abuses.
   Plantation sources said they were told troop reinforcements were
en route to the plantation to try to recapture it.
   None of the people interviewed by telephone in the Firestone
company town of Harbel would agree to have their names published.
   A Harbel resident said many people were celebrating in the
marketplace, welcoming the ``freedom fighters'' distinguished by
their red bandanas.
   A receptionist at Robertsfield Hotel, a three-minute walk from
the airport, said he saw perhaps 15 soldiers in all guarding the
airport. He said sounds of mortars and gunfire in the morning died
down by afternoon.
   Diplomatic sources in this capital city of about 400,000 people
said they had no reports of casualties in fighting Tuesday. They
said about 15 or 20 soldiers on the plantation briefly returned
rebel fire, then fled toward the capital.
   It has become a familiar story in the war. Diplomats say about 50
percent of a soldiery they describe as ill-trained and poorly paid
have deserted.
   Government forces now are believed to number about the same as
the rebels _ between 3,000 and 4,000.
   Monrovia residents were fleeing in fear and some soldiers
abandoned key posts before the rebel advance. Doe has asked the
United States to help end the civil war convulsing Liberia.
   Washington has accused Charles Taylor, leader of the rebel
National Patriotic Front of Liberia, of getting support from Libya,
but it also has said Marines will not move to support Doe's
government.
   Bridgestone@Firestone spokesman Trevor Hoskins said in Akron
that Americans managing the plantation did not plan to evacuate
despite the rebel advance. He said the rebels occupied the
management offices of Harbel after surrounding the plantation's
factory late Monday, stopping rubber production.
   The plantation turns out about 100 million pounds of rubber a
year.
   Hoskins said he spoke Tuesday with plantation managing director
Don Ensminger.
   ``Ensminger has told the freedom fighters that
Bridgestone@Firestone wishes to continue operating its plantation
and keep jobs available to the 8,500 Liberian employees ... and
their more than 85,000 dependents. They have told him the fight was
not with him or the plantation employees and they do not intend any
destruction,'' Hoskins said.
   A plantation cook, however, told The Associated Press by
telephone that rebels had ``blown apart'' a house where soldiers
lived in Harbel, adding, ``We don't know if anyone was in there, or
was killed.''
   As he spoke, he said about a dozen rebels arrived at the house
where he worked. They could be heard over the telephone line,
shouting at the cook.
   He returned to the telephone after a few minutes saying he was
``full of fear. They said they going to blow me up.''
   He said the rebels accused him of lying when he said the
plantation manager was not home, but he finally convinced them and
they left in a commandeered van.
   Descendants of freed U.S. slaves founded Liberia in 1822. In 1847
it became black Africa's first independent country.

   The Senate refused to limit debate Tuesday on
wide-ranging anticrime legislation containing curbs on semiautomatic
weapons. Sponsors warned that the threat of a filibuster could doom
the measure.
   Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., futilely
urged the chamber to limit debate to 30 hours, saying, ``Americans
want something done about these godawful assault weapons.''
   The bill's backers said they would make a second attempt at
curtailing debate later in the week.
   Biden said the National Rifle Association was behind Tuesday's
vote and said that if the time limit fails on the second try,
opening the door to a filibuster, ``it will be the end of the
official crime bill.''
   Both he and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said
they thought they could find enough votes to cap the debate at 30
hours.
   On the roll call, 54 senators voted in favor of limiting debate
while 37 senators opposed such a curb. Sponsors needed 60 votes to
impose the time limit.
   Forty-four Democrats and 10 Republicans voted for imposing
cloture on the debate while 31 Republicans and six Democrats wee
opposed.
   Mitchell said, however, that Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas
was among those calling for a second vote on the measure, whose
death penalty as well as gun-control provisions are likely to figure
in some fall reelection campaigns.
   The bill would bar imports and domestic manufacture of nine
semiautomatic rifles and pistols.
   Other provisions would impose the death penalty for 30 federal
crimes, overhaul the appeals system and sanction the use of evidence
gathered with faulty warrants if the police acted in good faith.
   Sponsors said they needed to limit debate if they were to have
any hope of passage. As of noon, more than 230 proposed amendments
were in the hopper with the promise of more to come. They ranged
from mandatory life sentences for rapists with AIDS to commemorative
medals for the Yosemite National Park centennial.
   The bill's supporters said debating each of them would guarantee
critics the power to stall of any final vote.
   ``If cloture is invoked, the crime bill will pass, if cloture is
not invoked the crime bill will die,'' Biden said. But he added that
there could be a second attempt to choke off debate within a few
days.
   No senators stood up to speak against limiting debate, although
in fiery floor exchanges two weeks ago western lawmakers declared
that many of their constituents were hunters and gun collectors and
considered any restriction on ownership to be a violation of their
rights.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., recalled how his grandmother used to
``pack a little iron'' in the frontier era.
   Efforts to curb military-style semiautomatic weapons, sometimes
called assault weapons, got under way in earnest in January 1989
after a deranged man with such a rifle sprayed a Stockton, Calif.,
schoolyard, leaving five people dead and 30 others wounded.
   The Bush administration has been pressing for the death penalty
provisions as part of the president's crime package. It also sought
a far more stringent overhaul of the habeas corpus review process,
under which defendants can appeal their convictions on
constitutional grounds.

   Two ships from the Baltic Fleet docked
here Tuesday in the first visit by the Soviet navy to West Germany.
   The port call by the destroyer ``Bistry'' and the frigate
``Neukrotny'' was aimed at improving relations between the Soviet
and West German navies, said Rear Adm. Viktor Litvinov, commander of
the 650-sailor detachment.
   A 21-gun salute greeted the ``Bistry'' and ``Neukrotny'' as they
pulled into this northern port city.
   The West German navy paid its first visit to the Soviet Union in
October, docking at Leningrad.
   The environmental organization Greenpeace said it had been
assured by the Soviet naval attache in Bonn, Anatoly Solotaryev,
that the ships were not carrying nuclear weapons.
   The ships are normally fitted with nuclear cruise missiles and
torpedos, Greenpeace said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush signed the trade agreement with
Mikhail S. Gorbachev believing the Soviet leader wants to resolve
tensions with Lithuania but without receiving concrete assurances,
the White House said Tuesday.
   Bush summoned congressional leaders to the White House for a
post-summit briefing and told them that before putting his name on
the agreement, he repeatedly expressed concern to Gorbachev about
the economic blockade against Lithuania.
   ``I accept that,'' said Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine.
   The lawmakers did not fault Bush for approving the trade pact.
Nevertheless, they emphasized that Gorbachev will have to ease up on
the Baltic republic before Congress approves any of the benefits
described by the agreement.
   The agreement is not an ordinary treaty, which must be ratified
by a two-thrids vote of the Senate. Under special trade legislation
applying to Communist countries, the agreement must be approved by a
majority vote in both the House and the Senate.
   ``Call it linkage or call it reality,'' said Senate Republican
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   ``There will have to be some moderation of Soviet policy with
respect to Lithuania before the agreement is approved and
most-favored-nation status granted,'' said Mitchell. The
most-favored status would give Moscow the lowest-possible tariffs on
its exports to America.
   Bush has acknowledged that the fate of Lithuania will be a big
factor in the decision of Congress whether to ratify the trade
agreement.
   However, the only price he has set for sending the agreement to
Capitol Hill is the passage of a law by the Soviet legislature
protecting emigration. Such an emigration law, and a trade
agreement, must be in operation before the president may grant
most-favored-nation trade status.
   Bush has said he intends to grant that status once the emigration
legislation passes.
   Moscow announced Tuesday a tentative postponement of any action
on emigration until September, and the White House seemed to breathe
a sigh of relief.
   ``That may not be bad in the sense of, it gives them a little
time to work on the emigration issue ... and (take) action on
Lithuania,'' said Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``It might well be that by the time the emigration law was passed
and we were ready to go forward with this (trade agreement) that
there would be action on Lithuania,'' Fitzwater said.
   The signing of the trade agreement was the biggest surprise of
the four-day superpower summit. And Fitzwater said Bush's decision
to sign came only a half hour before the two leaders put their names
on the document.
   The spokesman said Bush and Gorbachev had long discussions about
Lithuania on at least three occasions during the summit, and ``there
were no private assurances or conditions.''
   He said there was a ``general kind'' of assurance by Gorbachev
but ``there was no specific `I'll-do-this' kind of thing.''
   Still, Fitzwater said, ``We have the feeling that he wants to
resolve the issue. ``The president believes his (Gorbachev's)
motives are, that he wants to resolve the issue. ... We're persuaded
that he wants to resolve the issue.''
   Fitzwater said Bush's decision was the result of ``the
accumulation of conversation over the two days about understanding
that they knew our position and knew our concern, a feeling that he
was interested in solving this problem, a belief that there were
commitments to deal with this.''
   The agreement was an important trophy for Gorbachev, seeking
improved trade relations with the West to help cope with a deepening
economic crisis at home.
   Bush and other administration leaders had hinted that the
agreement would not be signed until Gorbachev ended his economic
stranglehold on Lithuania, which is struggling for independence from
the Kremlin.
   However, after impassioned pleas by Gorbachev to Bush _ and also
to congressional leaders _ the president decided to go ahead.
   House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois said Gorbachev
made a remarkable presentation to the lawmakers.
   ``Here was the first time a Soviet leader (was) telling us, `I've
got real problems at home and we'd like to establish a market
economy,' which ought to give us all a measure of hope,'' Michel
said.
   Gorbachev, flying back to the Soviet Union, sent a farewell
message to Bush as his jetliner cleared U.S. airspace at 1:39 a.m.
EDT Tuesday. It was received at the White House situation room, the
24-hour communications and crisis center in the basement of the
White House.
   ``Having completed my stay in your great country, once again I
wish to express my deep satisfaction with the results of my visit,''
Gorbachev said. ``The work we have done together during these days
will bear good fruit. I would like to express to you and to all
Americans my sincere gratitude for the respect shown to the Soviet
people and for your hospitality and warm reception.''
   In addition to earlier-announced post-summit telephone calls to
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and German Prime Minister
Helmut Kohl, the White House said Bush had phoned Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu and French President Francois Mitterrand.

   Free cigarettes? No more!
   The City Council voted 33-to-0 Tuesday to ban tobacco companies
from giving out free cigarettes to potential customers or smokers.
   The main target, according to the bill's sponsor, Councilman Sal
Albanese, was to stop young people age 18 or younger from being
tempted to smoke.
   Albanese said cigarettes are distributed free on street corners
and other places and that youngsters can get them.
   ``In ending this reprehensible practice,'' he said, ``New York
City will not only become the largest jurisdiction in the nation to
ban the free distribution of tobacco products to the public, but as
large as the next six jurisdictions combined.''
   Albanese said at least 15 other cities, including Boston,
Atlanta, Austin, Texas, and Cincinnati also bar the free
distribution of cigarettes.
   Chairman of the Council's Committee on Youth Services, Albanese
said the legislation would bar individuals and businesses from
distributing tobacco products in public places or at public events
for free or at any price less than the combined cost of the required
taxes.
   The state tax on cigarettes is 39 cents.
   The bill still needs the approval of Mayor David Dinkins.

   A Pan Am jet carrying 208 passengers
and crew from West Germany to Washington made an emergency landing
in Scotland on Tueday following a bomb scare. Police took one
passenger into custody and, as a precautionary measure, blew up two
pieces of suspicious luggage.
   There appeared to be no explosives in the luggage, said police
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Police refused to identify the man taken into custody or disclose
his nationality. They also declined to say if he owned the luggage
that was blown up.
   The Boeing 747, Flight 61 from Frankfurt to Washington, resumed
its journey Tuesday night, according to controllers at Prestwick
airport, five hours after making the emergency landing.
   ``The crew received an allegation that there was possibly an
explosive device on board,'' said a statement issued by Strathclyde
police, based in Glasgow.
   ``A full search of the aircraft has been carried out, items of
baggage were removed form the hold and a controlled explosion was
carried out by the Explosive Ordinance Depot,'' the statement said.
   The Strathclyde police force contributed much of the personnel
for the investigation of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over the
Scottish town of Lockerbie in December 1988.
   That bomb killed 259 people on the New York-bound flight and 11
people on the ground.

<HEAD>New Jersey Supreme Court Rules School Funding Plan Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JO ASTRID GLADING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Jersey is failing miserably at educating
poor urban students, the state Supreme Court ruled Tuesday in a
decision that declared unconstitutional the way aid is distributed
to public schools.
   The high court ruled, in effect, that determining school funding
based on property tax revenues is unfair.
   ``The evidence compels but one conclusion: the poorer the
district and the greater its need, the less the money available, and
the worse the education,'' Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz wrote.
   ``These students simply cannot possibly enter the same market or
the same society as their peers educated in wealthier districts.''
   The justices in the unanimous decision ordered lawmakers to begin
reforms by the 1991-92 school year.
   The state must assure poor urban districts spend about the same
amount of money per child as richer suburban districts, the court
ruled.
   The court estimated that the state needs to add $440 million to
its $3.5 billion public schools budget to remedy disparities in the
state's 28 poorest districts.
   ``Today's ruling is a clear victory for the children of New
Jersey,'' said Gov. Jim Florio, who last week unveiled a plan to
raise the state income tax. The tax hike would raise $1 billion for
more aid to middle-income and poor districts, while aid to wealthier
school systems would be reduced or eliminated.
   ``The court has recognized that the current school funding system
is leading us to be two New Jerseys _ where some youngsters head for
the best colleges, and others go down a road to nowhere,'' Florio
said, predicting his reform proposal will satisfy the court.
   New Jersey is among more than a dozen states where courts have
overturned school finance systems in recent years.
   ``I think there absolutely is a trend evident. In the last two
years, we have seen four state supreme courts strike down their
school finance systems _ Montana, Kentucky, Texas and now New
Jersey,'' said Arthur Wise, director of the Washington-based RAND
Center for the Study of the Teaching Profession.
   Other states involved in funding disputes include Kansas,
Wisconsin, California, Connecticut, Washington, West Virginia,
Wyoming and Arkansas.
   ``Since 1980, the gap between rich districts and poor districts
has been increasing, that's why we have this trend. The poor are
more hard-pressed than they were during the 1970s,'' Wise said.
   A new school funding system will take effect in Montana on July
1, passed by lawmakers after the state's highest court declared the
former system unconstitutional.
   In October, the Texas Supreme Court declared its system
unconstitutional. The state Senate on Tuesday approved and sent to
the House a $528 million education reform bill.
   A funding bill that would hike sales taxes by a quarter-cent and
increase taxes on mixed drinks and tobbacco products was passed by
both the Texas House and Senate on Tuesday.
   The Kentucky Supreme Court delivered a similar ruling last year,
forcing lawmakers to raise taxes to pay for $500 million more in
education aid.
   The New Jersey decision does not place a cap on spending and rich
districts can continue to increase spending if they choose. But the
state must increase aid to poorer districts if sub-par education
standards continue, the court said.
   Lawmakers may devise any remedy they wish to correct the
disparities, but they may not force poor districts to raise property
taxes, the court ruled.
   The court also ruled unconstitutional the politically popular
``minimum aid'' program that gives money to affluent districts
regardless of need.
   The rulings stem from a 1981 lawsuit filed by the Newark-based
Education Law Center, which brought the court action on behalf of 20
school-age children from Camden, Jersey City, East Orange and
Irvington.
   The ruling culminated a decade-long battle during which former
Gov. Thomas H. Kean fought the lawsuit and defended the funding
system.
   In 1984, the court said, school districts spent an average of
$4,030 per pupil, while the poorest school systems spent only about
$2,860 per pupil. Statewide, an average of $3,329 per pupil was
spent.

   Charlie Rose, who has burned the midnight oil
as anchorman of the CBS interview series ``Nightwatch,'' is leaving
to head a daily interview show for the Fox Broadcasting Co.,
officials said Tuesday.
   Rose, an Emmy Award winner who has headed ``Nightwatch'' since it
began in 1984, will join the syndicated series ``Personalities'' as
its anchor.
   ``Charlie and `Personalities' are a perfect match,'' said Michael
Lambert, head of Fox's domestic syndication division. ``His skill as
an interviewer has single-handedly attracted an amazing list of
newsmakers to the `Nightwatch' set.''
   ``Personalities'' is the first daily syndicated magazine show
focusing solely on people in the news, and will interview newsmakers
from entertainment, politics, sports, business, communications and
the arts.
   Rose also has anchored ``Face the Nation,'' ``CBS Morning News,''
``CBS This Morning'' and ``Newsbreak.'' He was en route from
Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles on Tuesday evening and could not be
reached for comment.

   An ``all-digital, all-American'' high-definition
television system developed by a U.S. company has made a last-minute
entry in the race to become the U.S. national TV broadcast standard,
officials said Tuesday.
   ``We are leap-frogging state-of-the art technology,'' said Mike
Walker, a spokesman for the VideoCipher division of General
Instruments Corp. showcasing the new ``DigiCipher'' technology in
San Diego.
   High-definition TV, or HDTV, provides vastly sharper TV pictures
and compact disc-quality sound; however, its signal requires a wider
broadcast channel _ about 30 megahertz _ rather than conventional
TV's 6 megahertz.
   The Federal Communications Commission set a June 1 deadline for
proposals on a ``simulcast'' system that works on today's TV sets
and fits onto the existing broadcast spectrum. On June 1, General
Instruments filed its proposal.
   ``The technologies that we've developed are proprietary
technologies that digitize and compress the video signal,'' Walker
said. ``We reduce the amount or data that is transmitted, but
maintain or enhance the quality of the picture.''
   Conventional TVs would receive the standard signal, while the
second signal would be broadcast and received on HDTV equipment
whose manufacturers pay lucrative royalties to the owners of the
technology.
   Other proposals before the FCC are from NHK, the Japanese
broadcasting system; Zenith Electronics Corp., an international
consortium of NBC with Dutch and French electronics companies, and
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   The systems would be tested for 12 to 18 months before the
government chooses the standard sometime in 1993.
   Walker said the technology grew out of VideoCipher research for
its core market, satellite and cable systems, into a digital
compression system that would let multiple TV signals move through a
single satellite relay.
   It is a ``seamless technology,'' Walker said. The same system of
coding, compression and decoding can be used by satellite and cable
systems as well as terrestrial TV broadcasting.
   The VideoCipher division of General Instruments, which is 263rd
on the Fortune 500, specializes in satellite encryption systems,
plans to have its HDTV prototype system before the FCC in February
1991.
   Walker said the digital system will have the advantages of error
correction circuitry already familiar to compact disc owners.
Electronic noise, snow, interference and ``ghost'' images would
canceled out.
   ``You can send that signal through noise, take it out of
correction and wind up with a perfect signal, an exact duplicate of
what was transmitted,'' he said.
   The digital compression technology will increase the number of
signals handled by a single satellite relay, or transponder, Walker
said.
   ``We could send two high-definition signals on one transponder,
or we could send up to 10 high-quality (standard) signals to a
single transponder,'' he said. The same technique would apply to a
cable channel or a broadcast signal.
   The company plans to develop the compression technology for
overseas markets, he said, lowering costs for satellite time and
increasing available channels.
   ``Ultimately, what we're looking for is video on demand: the
video store in the sky,'' Walker said. ``You can see the day where
there'll be 10 movies on 10 channels on 10 transponders 24 hours a
day.''

   Showers and thunderstorms packing winds up to 65 mph stretched
over sections of the Midwest on Tuesday, and the mercury dipped to
record lows in 16 cities in the Northeast and the Midwest.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from extreme northeast Kansas
to northern Missouri and southern Iowa, and showers and a few
thunderstorms fell from northern Illinois and northwestern Indiana
to western Upper Michigan.
   Thunderstorm-generated gusts of 65 mph were recorded in Douglas
County, Neb., and 60 mph near Manson, Iowa.
   A few showers and thunderstorms also dampened Florida and
southern Louisiana. Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the
nation, with sunny skies from California through the southern and
central Rockies to the central Gulf Coast states.
   Strong southerly winds prevailed from the southern Plains to the
middle Mississippi Valley, and strong northwesterlies blew over
Nebrasak and the Dakotas.
   Overnight temperatures dropped into the 30s and 40s in the
northern and central Rockies and the Great Basin of Nevada, as well
as New England, the Great Lakes region and the Ohio Valley.
   Low-temperature records for the date were set in 10 cities and
tied in six. It was 33 degrees in Akron, Ohio, where the record of
38 had stood since 1945. Other cities where records were set
included Albany, N.Y. (39 degrees, 40 in 1978); Huntsville, Ala.
(52, 54 in 1988); Louisville, Ky. (45, 46 in 1945); and Pittsburgh
(37, 38 in 1945). In Wilmington, Del., it was 46 degrees; the last
time the temperature was that low was 1925.
   The low for the Lower 48 states was 30 degrees in Butte, Mont.;
Alpena, Mich; and Bradford, Pa.

<HEAD>Texas House, Senate Act on School Finance Reform Compromise</HEAD>

   The Legislature moved quickly Tuesday on a
$528 million compromise school finance reform plan by easily passing
the tax and fee increases needed to pay for it _ including a
quarter-cent state sales tax hike.
   The Senate passed a separate bill outlining school finance
reforms with a 29-1 vote, and a measure making budget cuts and state
budget transfers with a 30-0 vote.
   The reform and budget-cutting bills were sent to the House.
Increases in the state sales tax, mixed drink and tobacco levies and
some state fees were passed by the House and Senate and sent to Gov.
Bill Clements.
   ``I am extremely happy because there is light at the end of the
tunnel and it's not a freight train this time,'' said House Speaker
Gib Lewis.
   Democratic legislative leaders and the Republican governor agreed
on the school finance reform package Friday after a three-month
deadlock on how to address a state Supreme Court order to give more
money to poor school districts.
   The funding package would pump extra money into the $13.5
billion-a-year school finance system and would raise an extra $100
million to bail out financially strapped social service programs.
   Clements killed two previous plans because they each required a
half-cent increase in the sales tax, but he compromised at the
quarter-cent level Friday, saying he wanted to fend off court
intervention in the school system.
   The House could take up the school finance reform bill Wednesday,
Lewis said. The House Public Education Committee endorsed the
measure with a 6-1 vote Tuesday.
   Beyond funding changes, the reform bill would make changes
designed to improve education performance and accountability.
   It would allow expansion of the pre-kindergarten program to
3-year-olds in the 1991-92 school year, increase testing of
students, and give the governor the authority to appoint the state
education commissioner presently appointed by the State Board of
Education.
   The tax measure approved 117-23 by the House and 30-0 by the
Senate would:
   _Raise the sales tax to 6\ cents on the dollar.
   _Raise the cigarette tax by 15 cents a pack, to 41 cents.
   _Increase the tax rate on chewing tobacco, snuff and smoking
tobacco from 28.125 percent to 35.213 percent of the factory list
price.
   _Increase the gross receipts tax on the sale of mixed drinks from
12 percent to 14 percent.
   Two other measures approved would double the fees for obtaining a
duplicate driver's license from $5 to $10 and raise by 50 percent
the state fees for highway permits to transport items that exceed
size and weight limits.
   Al Kauffman, an attorney for poor school districts, said he
expects to challenge the reform plan in court. Critics say the bill
does not go far enough.
   Clements said the reaction was expected and typical of
hard-fought compromises.
   ``I don't know anybody that's happy with the bill. The fact that
everybody's unhappy about it makes it probably a pretty good bill,''
Clements said.

<HEAD>15 Bound and Bullet-Riddled Bodies Found in Mass Grave</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mass grave believed to have been used by
the rightist military has yielded 15 bound and bullet-riddled bodies
and could conceal as many more, officials said Tuesday.
   The corpses in the Atacama desert are believed to be those of
leftists rounded up and killed by army troops after a 1973 coup,
human rights officials said. The discovery prompted renewed calls by
relatives' groups for the new civilian government to prosecute
officers.
   Digging continued Tuesday under judicial supervision at the
long-secret grave, outside the fishing village of Pisagua on the
Pacific coast 1,185 miles north of Santiago.
   Rights activists and government officials said the body count had
risen from eight on Sunday to 15 late Monday. Digging began Saturday.
   Belisario Velasco, an Interior Ministry subsecretary, told
reporters in Santiago that ``there may be an equal number of
cadavers yet to be uncovered.''
   Sergio Hevia, a lawyer for the Roman Catholic Church's human
rights agency, said in a telephone interview that all of the bodies
showed signs of having been executed.
   He said the bodies had bullet wounds, the hands were tied and
many were blindfolded. All the bodies were wrapped in tightly bound
sacks, he said.
   Digging so far has been limited to a single trench, but Hevia
said authorities planned to open two more possible gravesites.
   After taking power in a violent coup on Sept. 11, 1973, the
military ran a detention camp for leftists in Pisagua. About 30
prisoners were executed, or shot while allegedly trying to escape,
but their bodies were never handed over to relatives, according to
rights groups.
   The right-wing military regime, headed by Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
handed over power on March 11 to an elected government headed by
President Patricio Aylwin.
   At a news conference Tuesday in Santiago, a national organization
made up of the relatives of victims of military repression called
for the government to show ``firmness in clearing up the truth and
doing justice.''
   ``A healthy, solid and stable democracy is based on
investigation, prosecution and proper criminal sanction, within a
state of law, of those responsible for human rights violations,''
the group declared in a written statement distributed to reporters.
   They called on a retired army general, Carlos Forestier, to hand
over information on the Pisagua deaths. Forestier was then division
commander and military judge for the area. He now works for a
private Santiago-based arms manufacturer.
   Pinochet decreed a blanket amnesty covering all human rights
violations that occurred from the time of the coup through March
1978.
   Pinochet remains commander of the 60,000-man army, and has said
he will not permit prosection of his men.
   The mass grave was discovered by a church-sponsored human rights
agency, the Solidarity Vicariate.
   Local newspapers said the agency was led to the site by a doctor,
Alberto Neumann, who recently returned from exile in West Germany.
   The doctor had been imprisoned at the Pisagua camp, and was
forced to witness the execution of five fellow prisoners and to
confirm the victims' deaths before they were buried in a trench
already containing six other bodies, the Santiago daily Fortin
Mapocho reported.
   Neumann was set free by mistake, and sought asylum in the West
German Embassy, the newspaper reported.
   The bodies are being taken to a police lab for tests to determine
their identities. Authorities said the remains are well preserved
because of the area's extremely dry climate.

   The $200,000 that Congress appropriated for
renovations of the vice president's official home ``did not come
near covering'' the cost of the project, Marilyn Quayle said Tuesday.
   Mrs. Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan Quayle, also said the
electrical wiring on the third floor was so old that the house had
become ``a firetrap.''
   Renovation of the third floor of the 19th-century mansion should
be finished in about three weeks, she said.
   The project _ including new wiring, updated plumbing, new heating
and air conditioning, new walls and new plaster _ will cost about
$320,000, said Denise Balzano, an aide to Mrs. Quayle.
   The federal funds are being supplemented by private
contributions. So far, close to $250,000 has been raised, Balzano
said. Some of the contributions will also be used for furnishings,
she added.
   The third floor of the house on the Naval Observatory grounds is
being renovated to accommodate the Quayle's three children. When
President Bush lived in the house as vice president, the third floor
had been used as Barbara Bush's office, a maid's bedroom and for
storage.
   During the renovations, the Quayles have been sleeping in the two
second-floor bedrooms.
   Mrs. Quayle said the building was the ``most charming house in
the world,'' but had major safety problems.
   When the family returned from a spring vacation this year, the
construction crew showed Mrs. Quayle charred timbers behind a
ceiling light in the room where one of the children had slept. The
workers told her that when they took out the light, the charred
timbers were still warm.
   ``We were living in a fire trap,'' she said. ``The wiring had not
been replaced. When you touched it, the covering crumbled, it was so
old.''
   When the heating and air conditioning units were removed, ``big
sheets of crumbling asbestos'' were found.
   ``This is where the air was being sucked in to blow into my
children's rooms,'' she said.
   ``Believe me, the appropriation from Congress did not come near
to covering what you have to do for an old building,'' she said.
   A study by the General Services Administration and the White
House office of administration found the house needed about $1.4
million in repairs.
   For this fiscal year, Congress appropriated $200,000 for the
third-floor project and $120,000 to make the house accessible to the
handicapped.
   The White House is seeking $320,000 to continue the work in the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, Balzano said.

<HEAD>Canadian Compromise Talks on Meech Lake Report Little Progress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney emerged from talks
aimed at salvaging the Meech Lake accord to report ``a little
progress'' Tuesday.
   It was his third day of closed-door constitutional meetings with
the 10 provincial premiers, known collectively as ``first
ministers.''
   Mulroney, who backs the accord, said the others had asked him to
leave the meeting briefly to report small but unspecified advances.
   ``I want to make sure that no one misunderstands,'' he said,
before returning to the downtown conference center. ``This is a
small degree of progress as opposed to an enormous degree of
progress.''
   ``There's a great deal of work left to do and we'll continue this
work.''
   The Meech Lake accord, signed in 1987, was designed to win
Quebec's approval of the 1982 constitution. It recognizes largely
French-speaking Quebec, with 6.7 million of Canada's 25 million
people, as a distinct society.
   It also gives all provinces expanded powers _ including a veto on
Senate changes.
   The process began to unravel when provinces that originally
approved the agreement reneged following elections which instituted
new leadership.
   The dispute over reforming the upper chamber proved to be the
main sticking point.
   All 10 provinces must approve the accord by June 23 or it will
expire. Manitoba and Newfoundland are the two holdouts. New
Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna agreed on Monday after intense
discussions to go along.
   Together, premiers Gary Filmon of Manitoba and Clyde Wells of
Newfoundland have three years in office and represent only 1.5
million Canadians.
   ``I'm not sure you'd call it a common front, we're just
discussing common concerns,'' Wells said after a meeting with Filmon
on Monday.
   Wells is fundamentally opposed to Meech Lake. He takes particular
exception to the distinct society status the deal would grant
Quebec, and the prospect of a Quebec veto over Senate reform.
   Filmon wants assurances the distinct society clause won't take
precedence over Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms and
recognition of the rights of women and natives.

   The United States and the Soviet Union
on Tuesday edged closer to an understanding on the military future
of Germany, but kept the results of their post-summit deliberations
secret.
   ``The area of mutual understanding on these complex issues seems
to be broadening,'' Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
said after a two-hour session with Secretary of State James A. Baker
III.
   Asked if they had made progress, Baker said: ``I think we did.''
   On the table at the Soviet embassy were a nine-point Western
package of assurances against German aggression and a Soviet
proposal to enhance trust between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   Baker will take the results to a NATO council meeting in Scotland
on Thursday and Shevardnadze to a Warsaw Pact session in Moscow at
the end of the week.
   The Western assurances include a promise that a unified Germany
would not acquire nuclear or chemical weapons and that NATO forces
would not move into what is now East Germany after the merged
country joined the Western camp.
   The Soviet proposal, meanwhile, involves an exchange of political
statements between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, which Shevardnadze said
is governed by a ``defensive doctrine'' that does not threaten the
West.
   Baker, who first heard about the idea during superpower talks in
Washington last weekend said he knew ``a little bit'' more about the
Soviet proposition.
   Shevardnadze declined to provide any details to reporters. ``Not
for the time being, it's too early,'' he said. ``We need to do some
more work on that.''
   He said the two superpowers, along with Britain, France, West
Germany and East Germany, would explore the subject at their next
``two-plus-four'' session.
   Shevardnadze was referring to the meeting of the foreign
ministers of the four World War II allies and the two Germanys
tentatively scheduled to be held in Berlin on June 21.
   The German issue also is the central topic at the North Atlantic
Council meeting in Turnberry, Scotland, that begins Thursday and at
the the Warsaw Pact meeting in Moscow at the end of the week.
   Additionally, Shevardnadze said, ``we discussed future contacts.
We set no dates or venues. But we concluded we need those future
contacts.''
   The stepped-up pace of East-West discussion of Germany's military
future reflects a decision by President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to pursue a settlement even though none was
reached at their Washington summit, which ended Sunday.
   ``We need to do some homework,'' Shevardnadze said. ``We need to
explore some options.''
   He described his meeting with Baker as ``very useful'' and that
he was ``pleased'' with their discussion.

<TEXT>
   A Christian Scientist accused of manslaughter for
not seeking medical help for his son's fatal ailment testified
Tuesday that he had believed prayer was helping the boy.
   Special Prosecutor John Kiernan cross-examined David Twitchell in
an effort to uncover inconsistencies in prior testimony about the
severity of the five-day illness of Twitchell's 2{-year-old son
Robyn, who died four years ago of a bowel obstruction.
   Both Twitchell and his wife, Ginger, both 34, are accused of
manslaughter.
   The Boston-based Christian Science Church teaches that disease,
like sin, can be healed by spiritual means alone.
   Twitchell testified he was concerned over his son's health but
believed that prayer was working for Robyn, even during the last few
hours of his life.
   Kiernan again questioned Twitchell on whether he made a mistake
in not taking his son to doctors when he began vomiting and
gesturing at his stomach.
   ``If they could hawhy you didn't call a doctor for Robyn, because you
wanted to maintain your spiritual purity?'' Kiernan asked Tuesday.
   ``Absolutely not,'' Twitchell replied.
   Under questioning by defense attorney Rikki Klieman, Twitchell
testified about his knowledge of legal obligations for a Christian
Scientist. For example, he said, Christian Scientists were not
exempt from required prenatal blood tests, such as one given to his
wife, but that school children did not have to be immunized.
   Prosecutors have emphasized they are not putting the Christian
Science faith on trial, but that they are seeking to protect
children placed at risk by parents who rely solely on spiritual
healing.

<TEXT>
   An elderly businessman who gave more than $1
million to twins who posed for Playboy also lavished other young
female companions with expensive gifts, his former secretary
testified Tuesday.
   Shirley Schlodter, secretary for David Kritzik from 1972 to 1988,
said her late boss provided money and costly gifts, such as a
condominium, to at least five others.
   Ms. Schlodter testified during the second day of former Playboy
model Leigh Ann Conley's trial in U.S. District Court on four
misdemeanor counts of failing to file federal income taxes.
   The government alleges Ms. Conley, 35, failed to pay taxes on
$398,000 she received during a four-year relationship with the
suburban Milwaukee businessman who died last year at age 89.
   The charges carry a maximum penalty of four years in prison and
$325,000 in fines. The trial, which opened Monday, is expected to
last a week.
   Ms. Conley's twin sister, Lynnette Harris, was convicted May 5 of
evading taxes on $686,000 she received from Kritzik in a case the
prosecution described as a sex-for-pay scheme. Ms. Harris, who faces
sentencing July 25, could receive a maximum of 12 years in prison
and a $625,000 fine. Her lawyer, Dennis Coffey, said the verdict
will be appealed.
   The identical blondes, who grew up in Milwaukee, appeared nude in
Playboy magazine and in two films, ``I, the Jury,'' and
``Sorceress.''
   The government alleges Kritzik paid money to the twins for
arranged relationships and the twins were obligated to report the
money as taxable income.
   Ms. Schlodter testified that 36 checks presented as government
evidence were written and deposited by Kritzik but endorsed with Ms.
Conley's name. Kritzik also wrote checks to other female companions,
but Ms. Schlodter said she did not know if he similarily endorsed
those checks.
   Ms. Schlodter's testimony came after Lee A. Jones, a claim
representative for State Farm Insurance, testified that Ms. Conley
told him in 1988 she had filed income taxes the previous three
years. Jones said Ms. Conley also estimated her income at $30,000 to
$35,000 a year.
   Much of Tuesday's morning proceedings was held outside the jury
presence as defense and prosecution wrangled over the admissibility
of government evidence.
   Kritzik, who reputedly gave both sisters more than $1.1 million,
founded General Merchandise Co. in the 1930s. The company became one
of the world's largest mail order companies. As part of the company,
Kritzik later founded Treasure Island Discount Store Chain.
   He sold General Merchandise to J.C. Penny Co. in 1962 for $11
million.

   A terminally ill man fearful no one would
care for his handicapped son killed himself and his son, police said
Tuesday.
   The bodies of Raymond S. Short, 82, and Raymond S. Short Jr., 58,
were found in a family car outside their home, police said. A hose
was rigged from the exhaust to the car's interior.
   State Police Trooper D.L. Kidd said they apparently died of
carbon monoxide poisoning but autopsy results were incomplete.
   The elder Short propped a bar against the passenger door to keep
his son from getting out of the car, said State Police Sgt. B.R.
Lester.
   ``We believe the father did it because he was terminally ill and
was afraid no one would care for his son,'' Lester said. ``The son
wasn't aware of what was happening and would not have been capable
of recognizing he was in danger.''
   The younger Short had a mental illness, never worked and had
always lived with his parents, police said. The elder Short's wife
died several years ago and the couple had no other children.
   Their bodies were found Sunday by neighbors in this small town 40
miles southwest of Charleston. The car's engine was still running.
   ``You won't find a person who has anything bad to say about
Raymond,'' said Larry Lowe, a refinery supervisor at Huntington
Alloys, where Short worked.

   The El Comercio said the volcano began shooting out smoke and ash
on Sunday, prompting peasants to evacuate six mountain villages the
following day.
   It quoted a nearby resident as saying Sabancaya was producing
sounds ``like explosions,'' but that no earth tremors were felt.
   Geologists went to the site, 690 miles southeast of Lima, to
install seismographic equipment to monitor the volcano, the report
said.
   Geologist Roberto Kosaka told the paper a violent eruption was
unlikely. Kosaka said if the volcano did enter an eruption phase,
lava would flow out slowly, giving residents time to evacuate.
   Elsewhere in Peru, Shining Path guerrillas briefly took over a
radio station in Cuzco, Peru's tourism center, and broadcast a
message urging people not to vote in Sunday's presidential
elections, police said.
   They said two men and a woman with submachine guns broke into the
downtown studio Monday night, locked eight station employees in a
bathroom and broadcast the 25-minute prerecorded message.
   In Sunday's presidential election, center-right novelist Mario
Vargas Llosa opposes Alberto Fujimori, an agricultural engineer and
son of Japanese immigrants.
   Fujimori maintains a slight lead, according to recent voter polls.
   The Maoist-oriented Shining Path has been fighting Peru's elected
governments for 10 years.

   A missing pooch named Buford was at the
heart of a dogged custody battle Tuesday as town officials waited
for its master to return the mutt that apparently fled new owners
who claimed it at the dog pound.
   James Murdock lost ownership of Buford when he failed to pay
required fees and fines within 10 days of the stray's capture, said
town Dog Officer Robert Battistoni.
   ``My opinion is that the man doesn't want to pay,'' Battistoni
said. ``Everyone else has to pay.''
   Man and dog were reunited Saturday when Murdock said Buford
leaped into the back of his pickup truck outside a doughnut shop.
Now neither can be found.
   The short-haired pointer apparently ran away from its new owners,
who officials declined to identify, but not everyone accepted that
theory.
   ``To me it's amazing that a dog gets loose and jumps in the
truck,'' said town spokesman Karl Stinehart. ``I don't know if it's
like Lassie (and) it has a homing signal.''
   After Buford was picked up by authorities in mid-May, Murdock was
told would have to pay dog pound boarding fees and a fine for
violating town leash laws, Stinehart said.
   An exact bill had not been computed, but it would amount to about
$100, officials said.
   When the new owner reported the dog missing, authorities visited
Murdock, who initially denied having Buford. He was ordered to
return the dog, but no deadline was given, Stinehart said.
   Murdock was contacted by the the Springfield Union-News after the
weekend reunion, but had little to say beyond his account of their
reunion.
   ``It's our dog,'' he said.
   Telephone calls by The Associated Press to Murdock's home rang
unanswered Tuesday and an official at his workplace said he was not
there.
   Town officials said they want to reach a settlement rather than
seek any criminal charges against Murdock.
   Battistoni said the dog's new owners are willing to give Buford
back to Murdock if they are reimbursed the adoption charge they paid.
   Stinehart questioned Murdock's attachment to Buford because he
didn't claim the dog while it was at the pound.
   ``If someone really wants a dog or if it's as important to them
as a child, then they're going to get it within the time period,''
he said.

<HEAD>Rotary Club Launched in Moscow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rotary International, the worldwide service
organization, opened its first club in the Soviet Union on Tuesday,
expanding its network to 169 nations.
   The Moscow club has 25 members, including businessmen, a theater
manager and the head of a translation agency, officials of the group
said.
   The organization has never had a club in Moscow. It was evicted
from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia after those independent states
were annexed by the Soviet Union during World War II, said Rotary
President Hugh Archer.
   It was also evicted from 19 other countries ``where heavy
socialist ideology was the one selected by the government,'' said
Archer, of Dearborn, Mich.
   ``In the U.S.S.R., being a socialist country, it too had that
impression that Rotary was not a welcome member in its society,'' he
said.
   In the past three years, Rotary began receiving inquiries from
Soviet officials and citizens. The political changes that have
occurred in Eastern Europe ``opened the door even wider,'' and the
organization was invited this year to open a Moscow club, he said.
   Rotary also plans to open branches in Leningrad, Kiev and
Irkutsk, the official Tass news agency reported.
   Viktor Mozolin, a lawyer and business law professor who is
president of the Moscow club, said its opening was ``connected to
the whole process of democratic reform in the Soviet Union.''
   When asked whether the Communist Party and other Soviet agencies
did not already perform the humanitarian and service activities that
Rotary sponsors, Mozolin said there would be the ``duplication of
some functions which belong in this country to the Communist Party,
as well as our Komsomol and the unions and maybe some other
humanitarian organizations .... But I don't think this will be a
repetition of the functions.''
   Komsomol is the Communist youth league.
   The club is seeking to ``join together people from different
professions and various political views,'' Mozolin said.
   Rotary, which brings together community and business leaders to
build international goodwill, opened clubs this year in East Germany
and Czechoslovakia, Archer said.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela said Tuesday he expects
President F.W. de Klerk to make an important announcement during the
black leader's six-week tour of Europe, North America and Africa.
   There has been strong speculation in South Africa that the
government intends to end the national state of emergency within
days.
   Mandela said he hopes the four-year-old state of emergency will
be lifted and added that he expects ``a very important statement
from Mr. de Klerk in my absence.''
   Mandela was speaking at a news conference at the end of his
two-day visit to Botswana, before flying to Paris via London.
   State-of-emergency regulations restrict reporting about unrest,
security force actions, treatment of detainees, some forms of
protest, and a broad range of statements the government considers
subversive. Enforcement of the regulations has not been
comprehensive.
   Mandela reiterated his ``very favorable impression'' of De Klerk,
but said the government has not yet approached the black majority's
demand of ``one person, one vote.''
   It was the ANC leader's first visit visit to Botswana since his
release from prison on Feb. 11 after spending 27 years in jail for
sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government.
   Mandela, 71, reiterated his call for economic sanctions against
South Africa. He also insisted there was ``no question'' of
establishing specific protection for the rights of whites and other
minorities when a new constitution is drawn up.
   Mandela's 13-nation tour includes visits to the United States,
Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Ireland, Switzerland, Italy,
Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya and Mozambique.

<HEAD>Attorneys General Take up Dispute Over Location of Shipyard</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALFRED, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``border war'' sparked by a politician's
claim that Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is in New Hampshire spilled
over into Maine on Tuesday, as the states' attorneys general met to
discuss the skirmish.
   ``We had an excellent meeting, but I certainly saw nothing that
would indicate that the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is not in Maine,''
Attorney General James E. Tierney said after a closed-door session
with his New Hampshire counterpart, John P. Arnold.
   Arnold stopped short of saying he believes the shipyard is in New
Hampshire. But he said evidence produced a day earlier by U.S. Rep.
Bob Smith, a Republican running for the Senate, was serious.
   ``From New Hampshire's standpoint, I would not view it as a
carnival issue,'' Arnold said.
   The two states agreed to continue negotiations as they try to
resolve the dispute. Tierney and Arnold refused to disclose
specifics of their discussions.
   Critics have said Smith brought up the issue to gain publicity in
his GOP primary campaign.
   Tierney requested the meeting with Arnold a week before a
contested primary election in which he hopes to become the
Democratic nominee in Maine's 1st Congressional District race, but
he disputed the suggestion that he might trying to bolster his own
ambitions.
   ``I would be delighted if Congressman Smith had not had his press
conference'' a day earlier in Portsmouth, N.H., Tierney said.
   Should New Hampshire take Maine to court, the case would go
directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. Tierney asked Arnold to refrain
from doing so, but Arnold was not ready to surrender New Hampshire's
potential claim to Seavey's Island in the Piscataqua River, the
shipyard's location.
   New Hampshire residents who work at the shipyard pay Maine income
tax, and they are particularly angry over a so-called spousal tax
that Maine levies on joint returns. That taxes the income of the
spouse who works in Maine based on the entire household's income,
even if some comes from New Hampshire, which has no personal income
tax.
   According to Victor Bourre, a shipyard worker and New Hampshire
resident who started exploring the question in 1987 because he was
tired of paying the Maine income tax, the territory now known as
Maine originally included all land beyond _ north and east of _ the
Piscataqua River.
   King George II's 1737 ruling settled a border dispute between New
Hampshire and Massachusetts, then both British colonies. That ruling
moved the boundary between New Hampshire and Maine, then part of
Massachusetts, to the middle of the river, he said.
   Tierney and Arnold said their staffers would meet within the next
few weeks to discuss the issue further. The next meeting will be in
New Hampshire.
   Arnold brought documents purporting to show that the shipyard is
really in New Hampshire because of boundaries that were set up in
colonial days. Tierney said he would review New Hampshire's
evidence, but he plans to stick to boundaries that were in place
when Maine became a state in 1820.
   If the states end up slugging it out before the Supreme Court,
the case could take years to resolve and cost each side millions of
dollars, Tierney said. Lawyers might have to go to England to
research documents dating back centuries and expensive expert
witnesses would have to be assembled, he said.

<TEXT>
   Presbyterians on Tuesday adopted a new
statement of faith that mixes traditional Christian beliefs with
environmental concerns and images of God as both mother and father.
   Commissioners to the 202nd General Assembly of the Presbyterian
Church (U.S.A.) stood up and cheered after voting 499-25 for the
confession that represents the first statement of faith since a 1983
merger healed a Civil War-era split over slavery.
   ``We must agree on what we believe before we can agree on much
else,'' assembly Moderator Price Henderson Gwynn III said after the
vote.
   If the document is approved by two-thirds of the denomination's
177 regional presbyteries and again by the 1991 General Assembly, it
will become the 11th statement of faith in the denomination's Book
of Confessions.
   In other business, the assembly voted to allocate $1 million for
a five-year program to aid American black men and to advocate
normalizing relations with Cuba.
   Some observers said the confession is particularly important for
the 2.9 million-member denomination, which has lost a third of its
members during the past quarter-century amid some criticism that it
lacked a strong identity.
   ``The theological integrity of the Presbyterian Church depends on
the statement of faith,'' said the Rev. Jack Stotts, chairman of the
committee that developed the statement.
   Stotts, president of Austin Theological Seminary in Texas, said
the confession was designed to retain the historic faith while
``speaking both in the idiom of the contemporary world and to the
concerns of the contemporary world.''
   The statement upholds centuries-old church teachings that Jesus
Christ was both fully human and fully God, and that God raised Jesus
from the dead to offer eternal life.
   Reflecting more recent church concerns, the confession states
human beings deserve God's condemnation for the way they exploit
nature, ``and threaten death to the planet entrusted to our care.''
   Among other contemporary elements, the statement declares that
God calls women and men to all ministries of the church, and likens
God to both a mother who will not forsake her nursing child and a
father ``who runs to welcome the prodigal home.''
   In a denomination where slavery led to a 122-year split between
its northern and southern branches, the new statement affirms God
``makes everyone equally in God's image, male and female, of every
race and people, to live as one community.''
   The Rev. John Mulder, who helped direct a three-year study of the
church involving 55 research projects, said one of the findings was
that the increasing diversity of beliefs and moral behavior within
the church placed the denomination at risk ``of losing a clear and
well-defined identity.''
   But he said the new confession is a hopeful sign for the church.
   ``I think the statement of faith is a reflection of the church's
ability, even in the face of considerable diversity, that we are
still capable of forming a unified statement of Christian belief
that is consistent with our tradition,'' said Mulder, president of
Louisville Presbyterian Seminary in Kentucky.
   ``The striking thing to me about the confession, No. 1, is that
it got written at all.''
   The church, whose membership is less than 2 percent black, voted
to spend $1 million over five years to develop and implement
outreach and self-help programs for black men.
   ``I felt good when it passed,'' said Connie A. Allison, a black
elder from Kings Mountain, N.C. He said the church needs to address
issues of job training and providing equal opportunities for blacks.
   On U.S.-Cuba relations, the assembly voted 395-52 to work toward
normalized relations, including reducing trade and travel
restrictions, cooperating on controlling drug traffic, and
postponing plans for direct television broadcasts to Cuba.
   A resolution calling for free elections in Cuba was defeated by
359-85.

<HEAD>School Officials Issue `Ninja Turtle Alert' After Kids Lift Manhole
Cover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stop, kids! Don't lift that manhole cover!
You won't find Raphael or Donatello or any of the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles down there. They're just make-believe.
   That message from Champaign school officials came as a surprise
to some first graders, found peeking into a sewer in search of the
fictional crime-fighters.
   The result was a ``Ninja Turtle Alert'' sent last week to all
elementary schools by Arlene Blank, assistant superintendent.
   ``Somehow, two first-grade girls managed to lift a manhole cover
off,'' said Blank. ``By the time the adults got there, they had been
joined by two first-grade boys.
   ``One of the boys was about to climb down into the manhole.''
   Their motive was simple.
   ``They said they were looking for the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles,'' said Blank. ``They were very serious about it.''
   Worried that other children might try the same thing, Blank
issued the alert.
   Her memo asks staff members to talk with pupils from
pre-kindergarten through third grade and explain that the
pizza-eating reptiles are not real.
   Blank said the youngsters could have been injured or drowned if
they had fallen into the rain-swollen sewer system.
   ``I think some kids think they exist,'' said Kevin Fletcher, 8.
``I don't think they're really alive. I like to think of them as
make-believe.''
   Originally comic book characters, the half-turtle, half-human
ninja warriors are the hottest kid craze since Batman, particularly
since the release of a motion picture featuring them in March.
   The premise: dimestore pet turtles are dropped down a sewer
manhole, fall into radioactive slime, grow to be 6 feet tall and are
trained by a giant ninja rat to defend liberty.
   ``The Ninja Turtles are a nice story, but that's all they are,''
said Blank.

   A teen-ager accused of leading a mob that
stomped a man to death in a racial attack police likened to ``sharks
in an eating frenzy,'' should be tried as an adult, the state
Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
   Justices agreed with a juvenile court finding that the brutality
of the attack and sentencing limits that would have forced his
release at age 21 made trial as adult necessary.
   Joseph Taylor, 17, was indicted in March 1989 on charges of
murder and robbery in connection with the Sept. 24, 1988, death of
William J. Roberts, 35, of North Kingstown.
   Taylor was 16 when Roberts was killed while allegedly trying to
buy drugs at a Providence housing project. He turns 18 on June 26.
   Police officials at the time likened the attack to ``sharks in an
eating frenzy'' and said it had racial overtones.
   A witness testified that Taylor, who is black, told Roberts, who
was white, ``I'll kill you. This is what I think about white
people.''
   Up to a dozen people joined in the attack, witnesses said. Five
were charged. Three youths pleaded guilty in juvenile court.
   In its ruling, the Supreme Court said there was evidence to
conclude that Taylor ``repeatedly jumped up and down on the face and
chest of the victim.''
   Taylor has denied being the mob leader and wanted to be tried as
a juvenile. Taylor's public defender, Chris O'Neill, declined to
comment on the ruling, citing office policy.
   The high court also denied Taylor's appeal of a ruling that he be
held without bail at an adult lockup. Trial was scheduled for June
18.
   If convicted of first-degree murder, Taylor could face a
mandatory life prison sentence. Second-degree murder carries
possible penalties ranging from a minimum 10-year term to life
imprisonment.

   A Palestinian guerrilla leader captured in last
week's failed sea raid said Tuesday his squad had orders to spray
the Tel Aviv hotel district with machine gun fire and ``kill any
person we encountered.''
   He also said his Palestine Liberation Front squad was trained by
Libyan instructors in that North African country for 18 months,
carried out joint exercises with the Libyan navy and was accompanied
en route to Israel by a Libyan lieutenant colonel.
   The captured guerrilla, identified as Ahmed Mohammed Yusuf, the
squad's deputy commander, spoke on Israel television's
Arabic-language nightly news. The curly haired, heavy-set Yusuf, 28,
wore olive green military-style clothing and spoke calmly.
   His remarks, if proven accurate, provide the most detailed
account of the May 30 raid in which two guerrilla boats sped toward
the Israeli coast. One was intercepted at sea, and a second one
landed near a beach south of Tel Aviv. Four guerrillas were killed
and 12 captured.
   Asked what orders he had, Yusuf said: ``The target area was the
hotel district. First to bombard the area from the sea with Katyusha
rockets ... after shelling and machine gun fire, to go ashore and
storm (the target). They asked me to enter the Sheraton Hotel, to
kill everyone inside.''
   When asked to clarify, Yusuf added: ``The targets of the
operation were civilian and not military. We were asked not to have
mercy on anyone and to kill any person we encountered.''
   His account contradicted statements by the Palestinian faction's
leader Mohammed Abbas, who has said the attack was aimed at military
targets, not civilians.
   The remarks could cast a further shadow on the U.S.-PLO dialogue
that was launched by Washington after PLO chief Yasser Arafat
renounced terrorism in December 1988.
   A senior U.S. administration official said in Washington on
Monday that the dialogue was ``clearly in jeopardy'' following the
attempted raid on Israel.
   The United States is demanding that the PLO disassociate itself
from the attack and condemn it. Washington is also asking the PLO to
expel Abbas, who is part of the PLO's 15-member Executive Committee.
   Yusuf said Libyan instructors taught the squad how to swim and
operate small rubber boats and gave lessons in navigation and naval
tactics.
   ``A frigate accompanied us and participated in an exercise with
us,'' he said. ``The man from the Libyan navy responsible (for us)
would give us orders.''
   The Libyan officer, identified by Yusuf as Lt. Col. Zuheir, also
accompanied the guerrillas on the civilian Libyan vessel that
carried the squad toward Israel. Also aboard was Abu-Al-Az, the
deputy leader of the PLF, said Yusuf.
   If captured, ``the instructions were that no one was to admit
where we trained, who helped us and who gave us weapons and boats,''
Yusuf said.
   Yusuf, who was born in Kuneitra, Syria, said he was a member of
Arafat's mainstream Fatah group before joining the Abbas faction in
1988.

<HEAD>Recurring Chest Pains Keep Michael Jackson Hospitalized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Persistent chest pains delayed
necessary tests to determine if stricked pop sensation Michael
Jackson has heart troubles, his spokesman said Tuesday.
   Cardiologist Mark Zatzkis says a ``temporary setback'' in
Jackson's condition Monday forced him to postpone tests that may
keep the singer-songwriter hospitalized an additional day or two,
said Bob Jones.
   ``In the meantime, Mr. Jackson remains under observation. His
condition is stable and he is resting comfortably,'' said Jones,
vice president of communications for Jackson's MJJ Productions.
Zatzkis wasn't available for direct comment.
   The 31-year-old Jackson had been ill several days when he
suffered chest pains Sunday night at his Los Angeles home and was
taken to St. John's Hospital and Health Center.
   It wasn't believed Jackson, described by Jones as ``a health
nut,'' had a heart attack. The singer has been under stress due to
the recent deaths of people close to him and pressure to complete an
album, he said.
   ``Michael Jackson's very close friend and mentor Sammy Davis
passed; within the last four weeks his grandmother passed; Ryan
White, a young man he was very close to, passed; and the pressure of
the album; all of these things could be stressful,'' Jones told a
news conference.
   Jackson's friend Elizabeth Taylor, reported ``doing well'' after
a near-fatal bout with pneumonia in April, has a suite on the same
hospital floor.

   Twenty TV programs were cited for
excellence Tuesday by Action for Children's Television and will be
honored in a ceremony dedicated to the memory of Muppets creator Jim
Henson.
   Among the programs noted for both their diversity and their lack
of commercial abuses aimed at children were: ``CNN Newsroom,'' an
episode of ``Murphy Brown'' and ``Wonderworks.''
   Except for special award for CBS' ``Murphy Brown,'' no other
award went to a commercial network series. The awards will be
presented at a luncheon Wednesday.
   ``Particularly depressing is the extent to which marketing to
children has replaced creativity, with products embedded in TV
programs and ads introducing and even interrupting kids' videos,''
said the group's president Peggy Charren.
   Commercial stations in only two cities, Pittsburgh and Boston,
won awards from the group.
   ``It's a nationwide contest so it says that kids across the
country are not getting enough choices from television,'' said
Charren. ``Pittsburgh and Boston are doing nifty local programs but
for the country as a whole, local programs for children are kind of
an extinct dinosaur.''
   Charren said she dedicated the ceremony to Henson because his
creations ``will continue to inspire television producers who care
about children.''
   Action for Children's Television was formed 22 years ago in part
to push for legislation to limit the number of television
advertisements directed at children.
   KTVU in San Francisco and a statewide campaign in Alaska header
by the governor's wife, Michael Cowper, were honored in the public
service announcement category.
   And a special award went to ``I Want My FYI,'' an episode of the
Murphy Brown series on CBS focusing on the need for TV news for
children.
   The awards were as follows:
   Public Television:
   _ WGBH, Boston for ``Long Ago and Far Away.''
   _ WNET, New York and Quality Family Entertainment for Shining
Time Station.
   _ WQED, Pittsburgh for ``Wonderworks.''
   _ Maryland Public Television for ``TimeLine.''
   Commercial Television:
   _ WCVB, Boston for ``A Likely Story.''
   _ KDKA, Pittsburgh, for ``Let's Read a Story.''
   _ WTAE, Pittsburgh for ``Cappelli and Company.''
   _ WHDH, Boston for ``Ready to Go.''
   Cable Television:
   _ CNBC for K-TV, ``features for kids on a lively magazine show.''
   _ CNN for CNN Newsroom, a daily, commercial-free newscast offered
in schools.
   _ Showtime for ``Familytime.''
   _ Nickelodeon for ``Make the Grade.''
   _ HBO for Babar.
   _ The Disney Channel for ``Lunch Box.''
   Home Video:

<HEAD>`Mystery Witness' Backs Off Account of Bensonhurst Attack</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A ``mystery witness'' in the Bensonhurst racial
attack who emerged after the case went to court admitted Tuesday she
made up her story, prosecutors said.
   ``It is now clear that she was not a witness to events of that
tragic night as she had claimed,'' Brooklyn District Attorney
Charles J. Hynes said in a statement after the woman was interviewed
by prosecutors.
   Several weeks ago, the woman identified variously as ``Iris'' and
``Maria'' told reporters she watched as a white mob surrounded Yusuf
Hawkins and that she saw Joseph Fama fatally shoot the black
teen-ager through the chest. However, she canceled several scheduled
meetings with prosecutors, and was interviewed by them for the first
time last week, only after she was located by the police.
   During that meeting last Thursday she repeated to prosecutors the
story she had told newspapers and television stations.
   ``Earlier today, the woman, accompanied by her husband, gave a
statement retracting all her previous accounts,'' Hynes said.
   He said she would not be charged for making the false statements
to prosecutors.
   ``Her motives remain unclear. ... It can't be explained or
accounted for,'' a law-enforcement source said.
   The woman was unable to pick defendants yet to be tried out of a
photo array and said her account ``came to her in a dream,'' the
source said.
   Prosecutors had said that if her account of the Aug. 23 slaying
was true she could have been a witness in future Bensonhurst trials
and in a possible federal investigation into civil rights charges
against Keith Mondello.
   Mondello, the alleged ringleader of the white mob that chased and
surrounded Hawkins, was acquitted May 18 of murder and manslaughter,
but convicted of several lesser charges. A day earlier, Fama was
convicted of murder.
   The two men, both 19, are to be sentenced Monday. Fama faces up
to 25 years to life, and Mondello faces eight to 24 years, according
to prosecutors.

   ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' is nothing if
not ambitious, an attempt to stretch the American musical theater
beyond such landmark concept musicals as ``Cabaret,'' ``Company''
and ``Follies.''
   If its ambition sometimes overwhelms its execution, well, that is
why there is New Musicals, a for-profit laboratory for the
development of new shows at the State University of New York in
Purchase. The show, playing at the school's Performing Arts Center,
runs through June 24.
   But ``laboratory'' is not the word to describe this production
directed with remarkable fluidity by Harold Prince. ``Kiss of the
Spider Woman'' is of Broadway size, scope and quality. And that's
why it may be so difficult to really change the show without a major
overhauling of its production values.
   The musical is based on the Manuel Puig novel that later became a
movie starring William Hurt and Raul Julia. It tells the story of
two men jailed in an unnamed Latin American country. Valentin is a
political prisoner. Molina is a sexual offender, a flamboyant
homosexual charged with molesting a minor.
   ``Spider Woman'' chronicles their time together in a cell _ from
hostility to acceptance to understanding to love. What cements their
relationship is Molina's retelling of old movie plots, particularly
a hoary, 1940s movie musical called ``Man Overboard.''
   Numbers from this Technicolor song and dance alternate with grim
prison scenes. If the idea sounds familiar, it's similiar to what
Prince and the songwriting team of John Kander and Fred Ebb did in
``Cabaret,'' their first collaboration nearly 25 years ago. In that
show, set in the late 1920s, a Berlin cabaret became a symbol for
Germany's ominous embrace of Hitler.
   In ``Spider Woman,'' the symbolism is not as obvious. The movie
musical numbers pale in comparison to the story of two men who
gradually gain mutual self-respect through the telling of this hokey
celluoid tale in which Molina and the movie heroine become one.
   The Kander and Ebb score contains some of the team's most complex
and challenging work. Kander's melodies are among the best he has
ever written, and they are showcased effectively in Michael Gibson's
evocative orchestrations. Ebb's lyrics don't settle for the obvious
or glib.
   Their numbers range from sweet love songs _ there's a stunning
quartet called ``Dear One'' _ to stirring political anthems to
exotic tropical dance numbers.
   The musical actually contains a score within a score, one set of
songs being part of the movie musical Molina is spinning for
Valentin. It's here where the musical falters, not so much in the
songs but in the conventional staging by choreographer Susan Stroman.
   Molina is enraptured by these movie musical scenes, and
theatergoers should be, too. But more often than not, the numbers
just mark time, making one question Molina's taste and obsession
with the silver screen. One particularly athletic number makes the
male dance ensemble look like the cast of ``Mister Roberts'' doing
aerobics.
   Not until nearly the end of the evening when the movie and real
life merge in the driving, rhythmic title song does Stroman's work
come together.
   Playwright Terrence McNally, who provided the book, has more
success, particularly with the quiet, intimate scenes between the
two prisoners. John Rubinstein, never stooping to caricature, makes
a credible, even moving Molina. Kevin Gray is more enigmatic as the
mysterious political prisoner Valentin, although he has the show's
best voice and uses it well.
   Lauren Mitchell, who plays the show's title character, is saddled
with most of those mediocre movie production numbers. But her
personality is not forceful enough, making one wish for the sensual
and hypnotizing Sonia Braga who galvanized the movie version of
``Spider Woman.''
   The physical production of the show, designed by Thomas Lynch, is
huge, filling the stage of a theater that has the ambiance and charm
of an airplane hangar. The supposedly tiny prison cell for Molina
and Valentin looks bigger than most Manhattan apartments.
   The distance between the playing area and the audience puts any
meaningful character development at a disadvantage, although the
wide spaces allow lighting designer Peter A. Kaczorowski to splash
some stunning displays of light, symbolizing prison bars, across the
stage.
   Prince and his creative team have work to do, despite their
strong, uncompromising story and wonderful score, if the show
eventually is to make its way to Broadway. ``Kiss of the Spider
Woman'' knows what it wants to say. Now it just has to find a more
effective way to say it.

   Greyhound Lines Inc. on Tuesday promised to
continue service despite a bankruptcy reorganization filing that
delighted striking drivers and raised questions about the future of
the nation's only intercity bus carrier.
   Listing liabilities of almost $540 million, the Dallas-based
company filed Monday for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from
creditors while it tries to reorganize its finances.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Richard Schmidt scheduled a hearing for
Thursday morning in Brownsville.
   ``Passengers won't see any changes at all,'' said Liz Hale, a
Greyhound spokeswoman.
   There were no reports of riders flocking for refunds after the
filing, but those who wanted refunds should contact local customer
service representatives, she said. All tickets were being honored,
she said.
   Greyhound Dial Corp., which leases some buses and buildings to
the bus company, set $100 million aside from after-tax earnings to
establish a reserve for possible losses related to Greyhound Lines.
   Greyhound Dial sold the bus lines in 1987 for more than $270
million, but still holds preferred stock and notes from Greyhound
Lines.
   ``The bankruptcy (filing) action is a positive, stabilizing move
which should help solidify the troubled position of Greyhound Lines
and go a long way to ensuring the long-term survival of the bus
lines,'' John W. Teets, Greyhound Dial's president and chief
executive officer, said in a statement.
   Greyhound has seen ridership and revenue fall since most of its
6,300 drivers walked out March 2 in a sometimes violent dispute over
wages and job security.
   On May 7, Greyhound Lines chairman Fred G. Currey said the strike
had become ``irrelevant'' because the carrier had enough drivers to
operate. The company claims it now is serving communities that
provided 98 percent of its revenue last year.
   The bankruptcy filing had been widely expected. Greyhound lost
$56 million in the first quarter and has missed more than $17
million in interest and lease payments, putting it in default on
some agreements. The company recently proposed buying back $225
million of its high-interest junk bonds at a steep discount.
   Greyhound's Chapter 11 petition listed more than 1,800 pages of
creditors, assets of $508.78 million and liabilities of $539.78
million.
   Union officials, who maintain that Greyhound has not been
operating anywhere near as many of its routes as it claims, cheered
the bankruptcy filing.
   ``It illustrates the point that Fred Currey has been lying about
the company's finances, lying about ridership and lying about the
ability of scab drivers to serve the public,'' said Michael Holden,
vice president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1205 in Boston.
   W.R. Gibson, Jr., president Kansas City-based Local 1313, said
the union probably would ask the bankruptcy court to appoint a
trustee to manage the company.
   ``We're going to plan on replacing Fred Currey,'' Gibson said
Tuesday.
   Unions striking against Eastern Airlines got a bankruptcy judge
to appoint a trustee for that company earlier this year, although
such a move is considered unusual.
   Several industry analysts predicted Greyhound would emerge from
reorganization as a smaller carrier servicing even fewer routes _
especially to small communities _ than before the strike.
   ``I would see it as a very positive kind of move,'' said Jim
Cammisa, publisher of ``Travel Industry Indicators'' in Miami.
``Prior to the strike, they were marginally profitable on an income
basis. There's no reason, with their ridership up to 75 or 80
percent, why they can't pass a break-even profit level fairly soon.''
   Others said the reorganization could help Greyhound raise badly
needed working capital, but would delay the company's attempted $225
million junk bond buyback.
   The Chapter 11 filing buys time for Greyhound at the start of the
busy summer travel season but may force it to sell assets and
jettison bus routes, said Phua K. Young, a Shearson Lehman Hutton
analyst in New York.
   ``Serving a lot of smaller communities, I'm afraid, has gone the
way of the dinosaurs. A lot of mom-and-pop bus operators out there
are just waiting to see what lines that Greyhound wants to get rid
of,'' he said. ``That's where the future lies for regional
carriers.''

   Three leftist guerrilla groups said
Tuesday they have agreed to begin peace talks with the government.
   Leaders of the Popular Liberation Army, Quintin Lame and the
Workers' Revolutionary Party said in a joint statement published in
newspapers Tuesday that they are willing to work toward a ``stable
and durable peace.''
   Government peace negotiator Rafael Pardo met Monday with their
representatives.
   According to the statement, signed by Pardo and the guerrillas,
the government and rebels will hold meetings to establish a
framework for the rebels' demobilization.
   Two other major insurgent groups, the National Liberation Army
and the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia, took no part in
Monday's talks.
   Initial talks between the government and the three groups began
last month.
   Earlier, the M-19 guerrilla group ended two decades of armed
struggle by signing a peace treaty with the government.
   M-19 leader Antonio Navarro ran for president in May 27 elections
and came in third with about 12 percent of the vote _ considered the
best showing for any leftist candidate in Colombian history.
   Many Colombians hope this will lead other rebel groups to seek
peace.
   Guerrilla violence in the countryside continued.
   In the last four days, at least four soldiers and six guerrillas
died in clashes, army spokeswoman Lt. Maria Teresa Garcia told The
Associated Press.
   Guerrillas of the National Liberation Army, known as the ELN,
stormed a coal mine in northern Colombia on Monday, kidnapping four
workers and stealing explosives, she said.

   Prices of junk bonds used to finance part of
Donald Trump's empire fell again Tuesday amid speculation that
negotiations between the developer and his bankers would further
reduce the value of the securities.
   Bondholders, meanwhile, filed a class action lawsuit seeking to
block Trump and his associates from promoting his new Taj Mahal
casino at the expense of the Trump Plaza and Trump Castle holdings
in Atlantic City, N.J.
   The price of 14 percent bonds used to back the Taj Mahal was
quoted at $54 to $55 per $100 in face value late Tuesday, down from
$56-$58 on Monday.
   Junk bonds tied to other Trump holdings fared somewhat better.
The Trump Plaza casino's 12~ percent issues were quoted at $81-$82,
down from $82-$83, and 13} percent issues backing the Trump Castle
casino were little changed at $59-$60.
   Prices for the issues fell sharply Monday _ with the Taj bonds
skidding as much as $10 _ when Trump confirmed a report in The Wall
Street Journal that he has been meeting with major lenders who have
grown increasingly uneasy about his ability to handle his reported
$2 billion in bank debt.
   The lenders, who include units of Bankers Trust Co., Citicorp,
Chase Manhattan Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., are said
to be seeking a restructuring of the developer's holdings, including
a possible sale of some Trump assets.
   The U.S. District Court lawsuit claimed Trump gave the Taj a
confidential list of ``high level gamblers and affluent clientele''
of the Trump Plaza and Trump Castle without compensating the hotels
for the information, in violation of bond agreements.
   The lawsuit claims Trump also violated federal securities laws by
not disclosing the transaction and seeks an order barring him from
using any of the hotels' information or assets to benefit the Taj.
   It also seeks unspecified damages for the sharp decline in value
of the bonds. Trump Plaza bonds have declined from 102 percent of
face value to 82 percent since August, while Trump Castle bonds
dropped from 103 percent to 70 percent, the lawsuit claimed.
   Trump's talks with the banks have been under way for about two
weeks. Dan Klores, a spokesman for Trump, refused to say whether the
two sides were meeting Tuesday or to give any information beyond
Trump's brief statement on Monday.
   ``At this point, these are things that are between the Trump
organization and other people and we're not at liberty to talk about
that,'' Klores said.
   Investors have been unsettled by reports that the banks were
trying to prevent Trump from making upcoming payments to junk
bondholders. Such a move would devastate the value of the risky
securities, which are attractive to investors because they pay a
much higher interest rate than other bonds.
   Trump's lenders are believed to be concerned that his holdings,
including the casinos, are not producing enough cash to meet
interest payments.
   The developer has maintained in recent months he has no cash flow
problems. He did announce in late April that he was considering
putting some of his assets on the block _ including the Northeast
air shuttle he bought from Eastern Airlines for $365 million last
year _ but claimed he wanted to raise cash to buy new properties.
   Trump's other assets include the Plaza Hotel, Trump Tower
skyscraper and several apartment buildings in Manhattan.
   Trump's lenders are concerned because of a downturn in the real
estate market. Furthermore, the $1 billion Taj Mahal, which opened
two months ago, has not flourished amid the plethora of casinos in
Atlantic City.
   The Taj Mahal junk bonds have been hit the hardest because they
are seen as the riskiest investment. Analysts say the cash flow from
the other casinos is more certain at this point than that of the Taj
Mahal.
   Casino officials reported Tuesday that the Taj Mahal posted a win
of $36.5 million in May, a monthly record for an Atlantic City
casino. The win averaged $1.18 million a day; industry analysts have
estimated it needs to make between $1 million and $1.3 million a day
to break even.
   The Journal reported that the big banks also were concerned that
if Trump does sell assets, he might not be able to get the kind of
prices that he claims they are worth.
   The Journal story followed a string of negative reports about how
well Trump's empire is doing. Forbes magazine recently sliced its
estimate of the developer's net worth to $500 million from more than
$1.5 billion.
   Trump has maintained he was having no liquidity problems.

   The British will get less for their money Wednesday
as a new, smaller five pound note enters circulation engraved with a
gracefully aging queen.
   The new fiver, the first in two decades, is designed to combat
high-technology forgeries and cut production costs.
   ``No item created by man can't be recreated,'' said Nigel
Bevitt-Smith, manager of design and development at the Bank of
England's printing works. ``What we try to do is to make it
time-consuming and as expensive as possible.''
   The dominant blue of the older note has been lightened from navy
to turquoise, and a blend of background colors was created to
challenge sophisticated forgers who use modern color reproduction
machines.
   The position and color of the numbers has also been changed to
foil counterfeiters, and a silver-colored thread runs through the
new note, as it already does in 10, 20 and 50 pound notes.
   The Bank of England, which has already printed 200 million of the
new notes, said Queen Elizabeth's new portrait shows the monarch
``gracefully aged.'' The older five-pound note portrays the queen as
a young, delicate brunette.
   Railway pioneer George Stephenson replaces the Duke of Wellington
on the new notes, which have been slightly reduced in size.
   The fiver also contain a round turquoise symbol to make them more
easily identifiable to the partially blind.
   All English notes will be redesigned over the next four years and
will be 16 percent to 22 percent small, the Bank of England said.
   Bevitt-Smith said the bank will save ``a few million pounds''
from the size reduction.

<TEXT>
   Harvey Gantt has made history as the first
black to attend Clemson University, the first black mayor of
Charlotte and now the first black to win nomination for the U.S.
Senate from North Carolina this century.
   But Gantt said he wants his campaign against three-term
Republican incumbent Sen. Jesse Helms to be about vision, not color.
   ``There's a difference between Jesse Helms and Harvey Gantt, and
I don't just mean because I'm black and he's white,'' Gantt told
audiences in the final weekend of campaigning before winning the
Democratic nomination Tuesday.
   He said the difference is in their vision of America.
   ``In Jesse's vision of America, I would have never had the chance
to attend Clemson University,'' Gantt said. ``And run against Jesse
for the U.S. Senate? In his vision of America, I wouldn't even have
been allowed to vote.''
   Gantt, who took a 60 percent to 40 percent victory over Brunswick
County District Attorney Mike Easley in the runoff primary, said he
wants to campaign on problems that affect working people _ health
care, public education and the environment.
   The runoff was called for by Easley after Gantt failed to win
more than 40 percent of the primary vote in a six-way contest in
May. Gantt beat the historical trend of minority candidates losing
in runoff primaries in North Carolina.
   ``It's not important for me to be the state's first black
senator,'' he said. ``It is important for Jesse Helms to be
challenged by someone who understands the problems of the people of
North Carolina.''
   Gantt, a 47-year old architect with a master's degree from MIT,
served two terms as mayor of North Carolina's largest city, which is
75 percent white and usually votes Republican. Before that, Gantt
served on the city council.
   In 1987, Gantt's political fortunes were turned upside down when
he lost to Republican Sue Myrick by less than 1,000 votes in the
mayoral race.
   ``That was the worst moment I've had in politics,'' he said. ``We
lost the race because we didn't put enough effort forward.''
   Gantt and his wife, Cindy, have been married for 25 years. Their
oldest daugther, Sonja, 24, is a journalist at WBTV in Charlotte.
Erika, 19, is a student at the University of North Carolina, and
Angela, 17, and Adam 14, attend public school in Charlotte.
   Gantt sings baritone in the choir at Friendship Baptist Church,
where he is a member of the board of trustees.
   Gantt was the oldest of five children growing up in poverty in
Charleston, S.C. He said that's one reason he wanted to run for
Senate.
   ``One of the reasons I want to do this is because America has
been good to me,'' he said. ``I'm someone who came from humble
circumstances and I cannot say I live in humble circumstances now.
That is what promise did for me, this belief, this hard work, this
effort. I don't want to see that snuffed out for a lot of other
people.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is having trouble
meeting the demands of potential coalition partners as he nears his
deadline for forming Israel's next government, a senior party
official said Tuesday.
   The assessment by Cabinet Minister Ehud Olmert, a leading member
of Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc, comes just a day after the prime
minister said he would have a majority in parliament to form a
right-wing coalition government and that he expected to swear in a
new Cabinet next week.
   ``Different parties are raising different demands,'' Olmert said.
``Maybe each one of these demands is just and true in their own
eyes, but when they all have to come together in the framework of
eight parties forming a coalition, it is sometimes impossible.''
   ``We are making a tremendous effort to find a common denominator
that would allow the coalition to be formed,'' he added, speaking on
Israel Television.
   Despite early predictions that he would quickly form a new
government, Shamir has spent the past 40 days trying to forge an
alliance with small religious and right-wing parties.
   A new coalition would replace the national unity government the
Likud formed with the center-left Labor Party. That alliance was
toppled March 15 in a vote of no-confidence by the 120-member
parliament.
   Shamir's mandate from President Chaim Herzog to form a new
government expires on midnight Thursday.

   The Soviet Union said Tuesday it plans
to withdraw ``a very substantive'' part of its nuclear arsenal from
central Europe this year.
   The Soviet foreign minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, told a
35-nation conference on human rights the Soviets will cut 1,500
nuclear warheads by the end of the year from central Europe.
   In addition, 60 tactical missile launchers and 3,200 artillery
guns capable of firing nuclear shells would be cut, he said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Copenhagen for the
conference, said the Western allies welcomed the announcement and
added: ``The Soviets have quite an advantage in these weapons.''
   But he said it was unclear how many such tactical weapons the
Soviets had previously intended to withdraw, and whether they would
be destroyed or redeployed.
   Shevardnadze said of the reduction, ``This is going to be a very
substantive amount.'' He said relatively few weapons would remain,
but he refused to be more specific.
   Asked if the weapons would be destroyed, Shevardnadze said,
``It's our intention to withdraw the weapons and discuss destruction
at a subsequent phase.''
   In his speech to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe, Shevardnadze said that ``by freeing Europe of nuclear
weapons, we give further latitude to man.''
   European foreign ministers responded carefully to the Soviet
plan, citing the Soviet superiority in short-range weaponry.
   ``We have to look at this in detail,'' said Roland Dumas of
France, adding, ``Anything that goes in the direction of disarmament
is a good initiative.''
   Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany told reporters after
meeting privately with Baker, ``We first have to know what is behind
this idea of the Soviets.'' He said he would await the details.
   Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said his first
impression was that ``there's not much new'' in the proposal.
   Disarmament is likely to be a top item at the agenda of another
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe meeting in Paris in
December. The CSCE is comprised of the United States, Canada and all
European states except Albania.
   Dumas told reporters the Paris summit would probably be held Dec.
19-21 to discuss ``the reconciliation of Europe.'' A preparatory
meeting was called for July 10 in Vienna.
   Genscher said after meeting Shevardnadze that there was a broad
understanding the Vienna talks on conventional weapons, which had
slowed in recent months, should be concluded before the Paris
meeting.
   Shevardnadze also held out hope of a compromise on the military
future of a united Germany, which the West wants to see as a full
member of the NATO alliance.
   NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact alliance were undergoing a
process of ``transformation'' and starting to cooperate. In this way
``we can find a compromise on the German issue,'' he said.
   Baker was carrying a package of proposals to present to
Shevardnadze that are designed to overcome Soviet reluctance to let
Germany stay in NATO.
   Presidents George Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev failed to resolve
differences over the issue during their Washington summit over the
weekend.
   Baker's proposal includes an offer of help by West Germany to
build housing for Soviet soldiers returning home from eastern
Europe, and other economic inducements.
   It also includes reassurances that a larger and stronger Germany
would not threaten the Soviet Union, move beyond its present borders
or acquire nuclear or chemical weapons, U.S. officials said.
   The Copenhagen meeting granted observer status to Albania in a
further sign that Europe's last hard-line communist state wants to
end its isolation.
   An application by Lithuania to attend as an observer was
rejected, however. Denmark's Ellemann-Jensen said no consensus was
possible since the Soviets would object to seating a separate
Lithuanian delegation. The Baltic republic declared itself
independent from the Soviet Union in March, and the Kremlin has
imposed economic sanctions in an effort to end the independence
drive.

   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo arrived
Tuesday night to discuss with President Bush his government's
dramatic new push for normal relations with the Soviet Union as a
step toward reunion with North Korea.
   Roh, Foreign Minister Choi Ho-joong and members of their
delegation landed at nearby Andrews Air Force Base from San
Francisco, where Roh held unprecedent talks Monday with Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev at the end of Gorbachev's U.S. visit.
   ``This historic meeting has improved prospects for peace on the
Korean peninsula and eventual Korean unification,'' State Department
deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said Tuesday, noting the Soviet
Union's longtime role in Korean affairs.
   It launched North Korea as a rival to U.S.-sponsored South Korea
after World War II and was North Korea's ally and weapons provider
in the 1950-1953 Korean War.
   Boucher said the United States welcomes the prospect of normal
relations between Seoul and Moscow, forecast by Roh after his talk
with Gorbachev.
   Roh's ``northern policy'' was a foreign affairs success leading
to Monday's summit with Gorbachev, ``but it has had negative
consequences for human rights in South Korea,'' Asia Watch, a
private, U.S.-based human rights watchdog organization said Tuesday.
   Asia Watch recalled in a statement that President Roh announced
his northern policy in 1988 declaring that North Korea would no
longer be teated as an enemy but more as a partner in development
and eventual reunification of the Korean peninsula.
   Despite this, dozens of South Koreans ``have been jailed or
otherwise harassed for advocating or working for ... precisely what
the president himself now professes to be doing _ finding ways to
reunify Korea,'' the statement said.
   It urged Bush and other U.S. officials meeting Roh during his
tour ``to use every opportunity ... to press the South Korean
government to implement legal reforms, including revisions of the
National Security Law and to release those imprisoned for
non-violent political activity.''

<HEAD>Mexico City Air Pollution Just One of Mexico's Environmental Woes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This city of 19 million people, which played
host to World Environment Day ceremonies Tuesday, is one of the most
polluted on Earth. But impure air is only the most prominent of
Mexico's ecological problems.
   As site of the annual U.N. event to raise environmental
awareness, Mexico is focusing on making Earth ``a better planet for
children.''
   More than 1 million trees were being planted here and the U.N.
Environment Program's Global 500 awards were presented in Mexico
City on Tuesday.
   Mexico has been known as a transit point for species traffic, and
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari promised to sign the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna,
known as CITES.
   ``We will energetically fight the illicit traffic of species. My
government has established protection for marine tortoises,'' he
said in an address at the Fine Arts Palace. ``I have asked the
Ecology Department to join ... (CITES).''
   Mexico banned the killing of sea turtles on May 28. Environmental
groups hailed it as a first step toward ending the killing of an
endangered species.
   Those honored ranged from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of
Britain _ for drawing attention to the atmospheric deterioration
called the greenhouse effect _ to Thai farmer Jom Malai, who turned
his mango orchard into a bird habitat.
   A special prize was awarded to Chico Mendes, the Brazilian rain
forest activist assassinated in 1987.
   A report released Tuesday by the U.N. Children's Fund, UNICEF,
said environmental deterioration is killing thousands of children.
   ``It falls most heavily on the poorest up against the poor, the
children of the developing countries pushed against the limits of
survival,'' it said.
   In Mexico, as in other Third World countries, poverty and
population growth compete for environmental protection.
   The government has declared reserves, protected specific species
and passed environmental laws. Private organizations are becoming
more openly active.
   In Mexico City, a program taking cars and trucks out of
circulation one day a week has reduced overall air contamination 10
to 15 percent, the government says. Other sources say less, with
ozone, the main contaminant, not affected.
   Residents still choke on smog from the city's 3 million vehicles,
blamed for 80 percent of air pollution, and from 35,000 industries.
   Homero Aridjis, president of the Group of 100 environmental
defense group, said ozone levels in April and May were double or
triple the government-set maximum for four to nine hours a day. But
no emergencies were declared.
   Aridjis said the city keeps on issuing license plates to cars
that are nothing more than ``rolling scrap iron.''
   In the past 50 years, 70 percent of Mexico's forests have
disappeared.
   In Michoacan state forests, where monarch butterflies winter,
cutting by peasant farmers and loggers continues despite the
declaration of a reserve.
   Mexico's wide range of conditions makes it a world leader in
biological diversity.
   Half the world's reptiles and 62 percent of the amphibians are
endemic to Mexico. It has more kinds of mammals than Brazil and more
kinds of birds than North America.

   Former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt won the
Democratic U.S. Senate runoff on Tuesday and became the first black
U.S. Senate nominee from North Carolina in this century.
   Gantt defeated Brunswick County District Attorney Mike Easley,
and will challenge three-term Republican Sen. Jesse Helms in
November.
   With 99 percent of the state's precincts reporting, Gantt had
272,576 votes, or 57 percent, to Easley's 206,397, or 43 percent.
   ``How sweet it is,'' Gantt told chanting supporters at his
victory celebration. ``I want to tell you that God is good, yes he
is. And today the people of this state showed their confidence in me
with an overwhelming vote. It's a new day in North Carolina.''
   Gantt moved quickly to reinforce his support for a woman's right
to an abortion, an emotional issue on which he and Helms are polar
opposites.
   ``It's not the business of government to interfere with a woman's
right to choose,'' Gantt said, drawing a loud cheer from the crowd.
``What we want is a senator who understands the importance of
building a society ... for the 21st century.''
   Earlier in the day, Gantt had said he was ``ready to get into
this fight'' with Helms. ``I'm ready to get it on with him.''
   Helms issued a two-sentence statement congratulating Gantt for
his ``hard-earned victory'' and Easley for his ``hard-fought race.''
   In a concession speech to supporters, Easley said: `It's been a
long and tough road. I congratulate my good friend Harvey Gantt on
running a strong campaign. We all know that Harvey is a leader in
the Democratic party and he will be a leader in the United States
Senate.''
   Easley spokesman Hampton Dellinger said the victory ``bodes real
well'' for Gantt in the general election race.
   ``The margin shows he's able to appeal to both black and white
segments of the population,'' Dellinger said. ``It shows a very
strong possibility for him to defeat Helms.''
   Both candidates had campaigned more against Helms than each
other. Although both had hoped for a large voter turnout, turnout
was light _ between 15 and 17 percent, according to Elections
Director Alex Brock.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Gantt, 47, characterized Helms as out of step with the times, and
said he wouldn't be able to run for Senate if Helms' views prevailed
today.
   Both candidates attacked Helms for his votes on social and
environmental legislation. The attacks prompted Helms, 68, to enter
the political fray last week with commercials that accused the
Democratis of mudslinging. He also attacked Easley, 40, for plea
bargains he made as a prosecutor and Gantt for his opposition to the
death penalty.
   The closest the two Democrats came to a sharp exchange involved
Easley's listing of his differences with Gantt in their first
televised debate May 26. Easley said he opposed tax funding of
obscene art and a bill now before Congress that would raise gasoline
taxes and tobacco taxes.
   In their second debate, broadcast Saturday, Gantt said Easley had
distorted his position on the federal tax bill by implying that he
favored the new taxes.
   Gantt, an architect by profession, led the six-way May 8 primary
with the help of black voters. He gained 37 percent of the vote,
while Easley finished second with 30 percent.
   Historically, black candidates in North Carolina have lost runoff
elections. That history led to a change in state election laws
giving an outright primary victory to a candidate with more than 40
percent of the vote. Under the old law, a candidate needed more than
50 percent to win.

<TEXT>
   A reputed leader of an anti-Castro terrorist group
sought by authorities since 1984 has been arrested in the bombings
of three foreign consulates in Miami in the early 1980s, federal
agents said.
   Jose Ignacio Gonzalez, 48, was ordered held at the Metropolitan
Correctional Center south of Miami until a witness can arrive from
New York to testify in his bond hearing, which was continued from
Tuesday until Thursday.
   Gonzalez, sought in the United States since 1984, was taken into
custody early Monday by Guatemalan authorities, expelled from that
Central American nation, and arrested at Miami International Airport
later in the day, FBI spokesman Paul Miller said.
   Gonzalez is charged with bail jumping, conspiracy to deal in
firearms and possess and receive an unregistered destruction device.
   He was believed to be the last member at large of the militant
group Omega 7, according to Miller. Federal arrest warrants
described Gonzalez as a leader of the group.
   Omega 7, which was opposed to Cuba's communist government,
claimed responsibility for several bombings in the Miami area in the
late 1970s and early 1980s.
   Gonzalez has been sought on charges he placed bombs at the Miami
consulates of Mexico, Nicaragua and Venezuela, countries that had
official ties with Fidel Castro's Cuba.
   He is accused of the Sept. 11, 1981, bombing of the Mexican
consulate, which was heavily damaged.
   Gonzalez also is charged with transporting a bomb to the
Nicaraguan consulate on Sept. 2, 1982. While that device did not
explode, Omega 7 claimed responsibility for a bombing the same day
at the Venezuelan consulate.
   In addition, Gonzalez is charged in the Southern District of New
York with perjury and failing to appear before a federal grand jury.
   The FBI believes Gonzalez, a U.S. citizen, fled to Central
America in 1984.

<HEAD>Productivity Is The Ability To Compete</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sharp first-quarter decline in U.S.
productivity, or production efficiency, was centered almost entirely
in the service sector, and that makes the bad news even worse.
   The reason: In terms of employment, the American economy is
overwhelmingly a service economy, meaning most people earn their
living from jobs in the service-producing realm rather than the
manufacture of goods.
   Rather than making nuts and bolts, they use their skills to
provide transportation, communication, power, wholesale and retail
trade, banking, real estate, insurance, health care, research,
government services...
   Statistically speaking, it is a little known world, even by
government, which is one of the largest segments of that world.
Washington releases masses of information about goods, much less
about the world of services.
   Popular impressions are even hazier. Most people have mental
pictures of mining, manufacturing and construction. But they have no
clear image of services as an industry. Something promised, never
delivered, they might say.
   Yet three of four U.S. workers are employed in the economy's
service or service-producing sector, and most future employment
growth for the next decade is likely to be in those areas.
   Moreover, much of that growth is likely to be concentrated in
just three service areas: retail trade; personal services, such as
health care and education; and state and local government.
   No wonder economists are appalled at first-quarter figures
showing a 2.7 percent drop in productivity, or output per hour
worked. They know that if productivity doesn't rise, neither can
living standards. It's that simple.
   It shows in various others ways too, most importantly in regard
to global competition. A nation that cannot efficiently join ideas
and raw materials with manpower and money to produce goods and
services cannot compete.
   And it has a direct link to inflation, most clearly seen in
higher labor costs to produce results. Those higher costs, of
course, necessitate higher prices, which in turn force higher wage
demands.
   It is no coincidence, for example, that as productivity gains
shrank over the past three decades, some of the highest inflation
and interest rates in a century burned the economy and helped bring
on deep recessions.
   Those high interest rates, in turn, helped raise the cost of
doing business and thereby contributed to the very productivity
problem that led to them in the first place.
   Moreover, those same high interest rates discouraged investment
in more modern, state-of-the art plants and equipment, in a better
educated work force, in innovative, computer-enhanced measures, all
aimed at greater productivity.
   Lagging productivity is, therefore, a summary term for a whole
basket of maladies that afflict the economy and end up in the cost
of goods and services.
   That long list certainly includes poor education, high capital
costs, lack of innovation, waste in health care, political
chicanery, high legal expenses, government overspending,
environmental abuse, short-sighted management, improper economic
policies, unmotivated workers, lack of access to capital...
   You might add to that list the misdirection of capital, such as
in the investment of billions of dollars in junk bonds and corporate
takeovers in recent years, instead of improvement of production
techniques and worker education.
   All these raise the costs of producing goods and services, and
thereby reduce production efficiency. When production efficiency
falls, so does the ability to compete.
   And if you don't compete these days you don't live very well.

<HEAD>Retirement Won't Slow Down Legendary Vocalist William Warfield</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>URBANA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like the Mighty Mississippi in his signature
song ``Ol' Man River,'' William Warfield plans to keep rollin' along.
   His bass-baritone is still rich with musical thunder, though 40
springs have come and gone since he first became a national star
singing the moving anthem about the hard life of black stevedores
working on the Mississippi River in the MGM movie ``Show Boat.''
   He's 70 now, still on the road captivating audiences here and
abroad, and still sharing his art and wisdom with eager fans and
students. Since 1974, he's taught at the Champaign-Urbana campus of
the University of Illinois, and his retirement from the music
faculty is merely a technicality.
   ``I'll still teach but I'll be able to do more outside things,''
said Warfield, thumbing through a calendar in his small office in
Smith Hall. ``I'm booked up with performances through next May.''
   During his 54-year career, the versatile singer and pianist has
run the gamut of show business _ from stints in churchs and
nightclubs that merely paid the rent, to performances on stage and
screen.
   The son of a Baptist preacher, his goal as a student at the
Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester was not to
see his name in lights, but to teach.
   ``I didn't have stars in my eyes and I wasn't sure you could make
a living by singing,'' said Warfield in an interview. ``It never
occurred to me that I would be that lucky.''
   As luck would have it, Warfield joined the 1946 touring company
of ``Call Me Mister,'' a Broadway musical revue about soldiers
getting out of the Army after World War II and their adjustment to
civilian life. He was ``bitten by the performance bug.'' He appeared
on stage with other future stars: comedian Buddy Hackett,
comedian-writer-director Carl Reiner, and
choreographer-dancer-director Robert Fosse.
   ``I decided to stick around New York and try to make a career for
myself,'' said Warfield.
   His big break came in 1950. A Canadian stockbroker attended
nearly every one of Warfield's shows in a Toronto nightclub, and
offered $500 to finance his concert debut at New York's Town Hall.
The critics gave rave reviews to Warfield, whose one-man recital
ranged from Handel to experimental music, with hymns, spirtuals and
blues.
   ``My attitude was that I'd get a manager and make a living, not
that I'd become a star,'' he said. He did not realize the impact of
his performance until the the reviews hit the street.
   The Saturday Review said Warfield had ``remarkable presence and
range,'' and the Herald-Tribune said he had a ``wide-ranged,
flexible and sumptuous voice.'' Newsweek called him ``one of the
brightest stars to appear in music in years.''
   ``Whew!'' Warfield recalled. ``Everything broke loose.''
   While performing at the invitation of the Australian Broadcasting
Commission, Warfield's manager, Larney Goodkind, signed him to play
Joe the dockhand in the MGM version of ``Show Boat.'' It was a role
first created by Stepin Fetchit in 1929 and Paul Robeson in 1936.
   It was during the early days of production that Warfield
delivered his famous, one-take recording of ``Ol' Man River.''
Intended as a dry-run with the orchestra to give Warfield an idea of
timing and balance, it was flawless. It reportedly brought tears to
the eyes of the head of the studio, Louis Mayer.
   ``I had been singing `Ol' Man River' since high school,'' said
Warfield. ``It never occurred to me that I would be singing it in a
movie.''
   Warfield's career was in high gear, and in 1952 he performed in
``Porgy and Bess'' during a tour of Europe sponsored by the U.S.
State Department. He played opposite the opera star Leontyne Price.
They soon were married but the demands of two separate professional
careers left them little time together. They divorced in 1972.
   In 1975, Warfield gave a sold-out concert in Carnegie Hall
marking the 25th anniversary of his New York debut.
   But his gifted baritone was not limited to singing. He appeared
as De Lawd in ``The Green Pastures,'' a 1957 Hallmark Hall of Fame
television production. in 1984, he received a Grammy award for his
narration of Aaron Copland's ``A Lincoln Portrait.''
   Bob Bays, a retired music educator, said Warfield is superb as
both performer and teacher. ``He is one of our major artists. He has
a truly magnificant voice with that wonderful, warm quality that
communicates with people.''
   It was in 1974 that a friend at the University of Illinois
suggested Warfield for a faculty position. Though he never had been
to the campus, his friend's recommendation and the reputation of the
university's music school brought him to the university to teach.
   ``I kept my career active. I wasn't giving up performing, just
adding something,'' said Warfield, who scheduled classes midweek so
he could tour and perform. ``It's been a matter of organization.''
   One of his students was opera star Jerry Hadley, who studied
oratorio with Warfield in the 1970s.
   ``I got to know him very well,'' said Hadley. ``He told those of
us in his first class to call him `Uncle Bill,' and that's what we
always called him.''
   Bays said Warfield always was close to his students, and provided
a role model for young black musicians. ``More black students than
we'll ever know got through the university because of Bill's support
and concern,'' said Bays.
   Warfield was born in West Helena, Ark., the eldest of five sons.
His father moved the family to Rochester, N.Y., where Warfield grew
up loving music.
   He sang in the church choir as a boy soprano, then studied piano.
But it was his high school music teacher who recognized his
potential as he matured and his voice changed. She encouraged him to
enter a national music competition. He won a scholarship to Eastman,
where eventually he earned both a bachelor's and a master's degree.
   Little will change when Warfield officially retires from the
university in August. He will give up, without much regret,
administratives chores and chairmanship of the voice program. But he
still will perform and teach.
   And, students likely will continue to drop into his home for
advice and, sometimes, a slice of the sweet potato pie for which
``Uncle Bill'' is famous.
   ``I love to cook _ that's my relaxation when I'm home,'' Warfield
said. ``And, there are always a lot of students around to use as
guinea pigs.''

   American workers' productivity plunged at a 2.7
percent annual rate so far this year, the poorest showing since the
1981-82 recession, as labor costs continued to increase, the
government said.
   The drop was the worst performance since productivity fell at 5.5
percent rate in the fourth quarter of 1981, the Labor Department
said Monday. Unit labor costs, a key gauge of future price
inflation, shot up at an annual rate of 7 percent.

   Doubts about the stability of Donald Trump's

he is negotiating with major banks concerned about his ability to

   Prices for junk bonds used to finance Trump's Atlantic City
casino projects plunged as much as $10 on Monday as investors soured

   The selloff began after The Wall Street Journal reported Trump

a restructuring of the developer's holdings, including a possible

   Doubts about the financial stability of Donald
Trump's casino and real estate empire are growing, with major banks
seeking assurances about the developer's ability to handle his
billion-dollar debt load.
   Investors also are growing uneasy. Prices for junk bonds used to
finance Trump's Atlantic City casino projects plunged as much as $10
Monday.
   The selloff began after The Wall Street Journal reported Trump
has been meeting with major lenders who have grown increasingly
uneasy about his reported $2 billion in bank debt. They are seeking
a restructuring of the developer's holdings, including a possible
sale of some Trump assets.
   The Journal said Trump's lenders have grown concerned that his
holdings, including his three Atlantic City casinos, are not
producing enough cash to meet payments. The report said they had
begun meeting with Trump and his aides two weeks ago.
   Trump issued a terse but upbeat statement in response to the
Journal story, confirming the talks were under way but calling them
``cooperative and constructive.''
   Calls to Trump's office were referred to his spokesman, Howard J.
Rubenstein, who refused to give any information about the
negotiations beyond the statement.
   Monday's developments further eroded Trump's image as a self-made
American success story.
   In recent months the developer, while maintaining he wasn't
having cash flow problems, has said he was considering putting some
of his assets on the block, including the Northeast air shuttle he
bought from Eastern Airlines for $365 million last year. Trump said
he wanted the cash to buy new properties.
   Trump's assets include the Plaza Hotel, Trump Tower skyscraper
and several apartment buildings in Manhattan; the casinos, including
the recently opened $1 billion Taj Mahal, Trump Plaza and Trump
Castle; and the Trump Shuttle.
   The Journal said Monday that some of the planned sales had fallen
through or put on hold. For example, the developer's plan to sell
his Trump Princess yacht for $115 million to Japanese investors had
failed, the Journal said, quoting people familiar with the talks.
   Trump's lenders likely are concerned because of a downturn in the
real estate market. Furthermore, the Taj Mahal, which opened two
months ago, apparently has not flourished amid the plethora of
casinos in Atlantic City.
   Mike Mulvaney, who follows the Taj Mahal and Trump Plaza casinos
for Moody's Investors Service, said he had reports the Taj Mahal
``has not been operating to its fullest potential.'' The Trump Plaza
was faring somewhat better, he said.
   The Journal reported that the big banks also were concerned that
if Trump does sell assets, he might not be able to get the kind of
prices that he claims they are worth.
   In his statement Monday, Trump continued to talk up the worth of
his holdings. ``They are unique, well positioned and they have great
long-term value,'' he said.
   The junk bond market was not reassured by Trump's assertions.
   Trump Taj Mahal 14 percent bonds were down $10 and being quoted
at $56 to $58 per $100 in face value in late afternoon. Trump Plaza
12~ percent bonds, meanwhile, were down $4 and quoted at $82-$83,
while Trump Castle 13} percent issues were off $10 and quoted at
$59-$61.
   A high-yield bond market analyst, who asked not to be identified,
said the Journal article unsettled junk bond holders.
   ``It raises a lot of doubt on how liquid the guy is and if the
banks are going to call in their debt,'' the analyst said.
   The Journal story followed a string of negative reports about how
well Trump's empire is doing. Forbes magazine recently sliced its
estimate of the developer's net worth to $500 million from more than
$1.5 billion.
   Trump consistently has maintained he was having no liquidity
problems. After questions were first raised about his cash flow, the
developer was so enraged that he threatened to sue newspapers if
they reported he was strapped for cash.
   Rubenstein refused to discuss Trump's cash situation, how much
debt he is carrying, or whether he will be disposing of any assets.

   The United States must reduce its budget
deficit to free up funds needed to finance sweeping economic change
in Eastern Europe, several former high-ranking government officials
said.
   A looming shortage of capital is one of the biggest threats to
reform in the former Soviet bloc and efforts to revamp the worldwide
trading system, officials said Monday at an annual meeting of
leaders of private and public banks from 22 nations.
   Deficit reduction is the ``acid test'' for improving the U.S.
position in the world economy, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
A. Volcker told the bankers gathered for the International Monetary
Conference.
   ``I submit to you that no other single measure we could take
would be so important in supporting the potential for trade and
development in the 1990s,'' he said in a closed-door address to the
bankers, according to a text of his remarks.
   ``Frankly, what has concerned me the most has been the tendency
for the United States to retreat from economic leadership in recent
years,'' he said.
   Volcker, who now runs a New York investment house, told reporters
later that the United States should stop criticizing Japan for its
low consumer spending and high savings rate and instead get its own
fiscal house in order.
   Nigel Lawson, former chancellor of the Exchequer in Great
Britain, said there are signs that private savings worldwide are not
matching investment needs, ``a discrepancy that will be further
exacerbated by the new investment opportunities now beginning to
arise in Eastern Europe.''
   ``It is important that governments cease to make demands on
private savings, whether at home or overseas, by running budget
deficits,'' he said, according to a copy of his remarks. Lawson did
not specifically mention the United States.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told the bankers at an open
session that they must help meet the funding needs of Eastern Europe.
   ``As more countries embrace the principles of economic freedom,
creditors will need to stand ready to lend their support,'' he said.
``You in this room cannot simply be bystanders to this process.''
   But Lawson said in his remarks that commercial bank lending to
the governments of Eastern Europe is not the answer to those
nations' needs for capital. ``Governments, for their part, must
rigorously refrain from encouraging or urging banks to make such
loans'' due to their risky nature, he said.
   Brady outlined current U.S. efforts to help fund moves away from
government-owned industry both in Eastern Europe and South America.
He said the United States has committed nearly $1 billion over three
years for Poland and Hungary, and that it is the largest contributor
to the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Brady
did not call for any increases in spending to help these nations.
   ``Our challenge in the developed countries is to encourage and
nurture these impulses for economic freedom,'' he said. ``But let's
face it: The world is short of capital, and governments are shorter
still.''
   He said the developed world also must work to maintain steady
economic growth and open markets to make it easier for these nations
to succeed.
   Volcker expressed optimism about the potential for international
trade and development in the 1990s in light of the decline of
communism.
   ``After all, if things go reasonably well, 100 million people in
Eastern Europe, 300 million in Russia and over a billion in China
have the theoretical potential for growing 5 to 10 percent a year,
like the East Asians in the 1980s,'' he said.
   But Volcker cautioned that there are several potential pitfalls
for that optimistic scenario, including a shortage of capital and
the possibility for trade frictions that could lead to protectionist
policies.
   If current negotiations aimed at liberalizing the global trading
system end in disarray later this year, Congress may act to restrict
imports and foreign investment, he said.
   ``That would, in turn, certainly reinforce those in Europe who
would like to restrict access to their markets,'' he added.
   If such trade restrictions coincided with a recession and a
softening in the value of the dollar, serious damage to the world
economy could result, Volcker said.

   Here is a chronology of events leading up to Monday's filing for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy
Code by Greyhound Lines Inc.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   March 19, 1987 _ An investor group led by Fred G. Currey acquires
the bus operations of Greyhound Corp., since renamed Greyhound Dial
Corp., and takes them private in a $270 million leveraged buyout.
   July 14, 1987 _ The new Greyhound Lines Inc. pays $80 million for
Dallas-based Trailways Lines Inc., then the nation's largest
operator of Trailways buses.
   March 2, 1990 _ Most of the company's 6,300 bus drivers go on
strike over wages and job security. Two shots are fired into
Greyhound's main Chicago terminal but there are no injuries. It is
the first of scores of shootings, bomb threats and incidents
vandalism reported by the company.
   March 3 _ A picketing driver in Redding, Calif., is killed after
being crushed by a bus driven by a replacement driver.
   March 18 _ Greyhound walks out of contract negotiations in
Tucson, Ariz., to protest strike violence and says it won't resume
talks until a week passes without violence.
   March 31 _ The driver of an independent bus operating on a
Greyhound route from Nashville, Tenn., to Louisville, Ky., under a
pooling arrangement is shot and critically wounded by a man in a
passing pickup.
   April 12 _ Using new hires and drivers who cross picket lines,
Greyhound says it is serving 72 percent of pre-strike miles. The
union dismisses the claim.
   May 3 _ The company says it is serving 87 percent of pre-strike
locations and passenger loads are just over half of the previous
year's levels.
   May 4 _ Greyhound reports a $55.8 million first-quarter loss and
blames it partly on increased expenses to cope with strike violence.
   May 5 _ In the first talks in six weeks, Greyhound offers
contract that would cut 4,500 union jobs, change from per-mile wage
rates to hourly wage rates and freeze wages for four years. Union
calls offer an ``insult.'' No further talks are scheduled.
   May 7 _ Currey declares victory, saying strike has become
``irrevelant'' because company has hired enough drivers to replace
strikers.
   May 21 _ The company asks holders of $225 million of its junk
bonds to sell them back at steep discounts to help it avoid
bankruptcy. It also changes its pay scale for drivers and withdraws
proposed bonus and pension schemes to save money.
   May 23 _ Two striking employees are sentenced to jail in Boston
for damaging buses, the first jail terms handed down for
strike-related violence.
   May 29 _ A financial adviser hired by drivers requests a meeting
with Greyhound to discuss a possible employee buyout.
   June 4 _ Greyhound files for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

<HEAD>Corroon &amp; Black, Willis Faber Insurance Brokers Agree to Merge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The merger of British insurance broker Willis
Faber PLC and New York-based Corroon &amp; Black Corp. will help both
companies expand into new markets in continental Europe and the
Pacific Rim, officials said.
   The companies also said the deal would give each broker access to
the other's home market, where they currently have little presence.
   ``We have a perfect fit and the synergies will come immediately,
I believe,'' said Richard Miller, chairman and chief executive of
Corroon &amp; Black.
   Willis Faber and Corroon &amp; Black said Monday they had agreed on a
$778 million stock swap that would create the world's fourth-largest
insurance broker. The brokers link insurance underwriters with a
broad range of clients including airlines, shippers and
manufacturers.
   Top executives of the two companies already are planning to shop
for other firms in Europe and the Pacific to fulfill their expansion
aims.
   ``We'll be working Europe together very soon,'' Miller said.
``We're starting to make joint efforts to attract some new players
to this team.''
   ``It's definitely a drawback if you do not have the resources in
place where your customers have offices,'' Miller said. Spreading
out internationally ``makes you more competitive, definetely.''
   ``You have to be able to take care of your clients wherever they
are,'' said John V.H. Robins, executive director of Willis Faber,
Britain's second-largest insurance broker after Sedgwick Group PLC.
   The new firm, Willis Corroon PLC, would be based in Britain and
is expected to have 1990 revenue of about $1 billion. The merger
would create the world's fourth largest insurance brokerage in terms
of revenue. Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. Inc. of New York is the largest.
   News of the merger did not cheer investors, though. Willis Faber
shares dropped nearly 9 percent to 265 pence, the equivalent of
$4.43 a share, on the London Stock Exchange. Corroon &amp; Black fell
$2.25 to $34.25 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Corroon &amp; Black stockholders would get 7.8 Willis Faber shares
for every Corroon &amp; Black share they hold, the equivalent of $34.55
a share based on Monday's closing price. The deal values Corroon &amp;
Black at the equivalent of $778 million.
   Despite the lackluster market reaction, some analysts praised the
strategy behind the deal.
   ``I think that some of the best opportunities for 1992 are for
the brokers who can easily cross international lines,'' said Gloria
Vogel, a stock analyst at Bear Stearns, referring to the scheduled
dismantling of trade barriers within Europe's Common Market.
   The new company would be 60 percent-owned by shareholders of the
British group and 40 percent-owned by Corroon shareholders, the
companies said.
   Miller would be chief executive of the merged firm. Roger J.
Elliott, chairman of Willis Faber, would be executive chairman of
the new company.
   The board of Willis Corroon is to have equal representation from
the two companies.
   The merger is expected to be completed by the end of September.
The proposed transaction must be approved by stockholders of both
companies and by U.S. and British regulators.
   Neither company forsaw much employee overlap in the merged
business.
   Corroon &amp; Black is the world's sixth-largest insurance brokerage.
It also provides risk management advice, reinsurance brokerage and
other services such as health care and employee benefits.
   Willis Faber, the world's fifth-largest brokerage, handles
insurance and reinsurance brokerage as well as risk management
services. Its serves clients in the fields of aviation, marine and
energy.
   Corroon has nearly all its business in the United States, while
Willis Faber gets about 80 percent of its revenues from Britain.
Corroon sold its 29.9 percent interest in the British broker Minet
Holdings PLC in February 1988.
   Willis Faber's after-tax profit rose 19 percent to 37.6 million
pounds, or $63 million, in 1989 on a 4 percent revenue gain to 237.8
million pounds, or $397 million.
   New York-based Corroon &amp; Black, however, has suffered from its
exposure to the depressed U.S. insurance market. For the first
quarter, the company reported a 29 percent decline in net income to
$9.1 million as revenue fell 4 percent to $117 million.

   Seven of eight divisions in Federated
Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. showed operating
profits in April, encouraging officials who reported a $24.5 million
loss overall for the month.
   ``We continue to make progress across the business,'' said Allen
I. Questrom, chairman and chief executive officer of the retailers.
   Federated and Allied filed their monthly report Monday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, where they sought Chapter 11 protection in
January. The retailers said their performance was strong in April,
although the cost of servicing their big debt helped leave them with
the $24.5 million loss for the month.
   Federated and Allied are required to report monthly results to
the Bankruptcy Court.
   Spokeswoman Carol Sanger said lackluster sales were expected at
the stores immediately following the bankruptcy filing.
   ``But it has not turned out that way,'' she said. ``The
stabilization has come much farther than where we thought we would
be at this time.''
   The overall April loss in the Federated division was listed as
$12.7 million. Federated operates 132 Lazarus, Bloomingdale's,
Abraham and Strauss, Burdine's, Rich's and Goldsmith's stores in 19
states.
   Allied's loss was $11.8 million. Allied operates 128 Jordan
Marsh, Maas Brothers, The Bon Marche and Stern's stores in 17 states.
   The court filing said Federated had an operating profit of $11.2
million for the month, and Allied recorded operating profits of $7.9
million. Those figures don't take into account the retailers' debt
servicing costs.
   For April, Federated listed interest expense of $24.5 million,
and Allied listed $16.7 million.
   Federated and Allied executives have maintained that their
divisions and store chains are strong and could be profitable if
they were not saddled with so much debt _ most of it stemming from
the takeovers of the retailers by Canadian real estate tycoon Robert
Campeau.
   Ms. Sanger said management was encouraged by March-April sales
and earnings and that the period marked ``a continuing stabilization
of the business in the post-Chapter 11 filing period.''
   ``Sales and earnings in the combined March-April period were
consistent with management's expectations,'' she said. ``Moreover,
both Federated and Allied posted operating gains in April for the
second straight month.''
   Sales of soft goods increased in April, continuing March trends
in such merchandise as women's sportswear, coats, shoes and
cosmetics, Ms. Sanger said.
   ``Key performance indicators in the March-April period showed
encouraging trends, and I think any weakness in the business that we
currently are experiencing is related more to the general retail
climate than to Federated and Allied in particular,'' Questrom said.
   Also Monday, the retailers told the Bankruptcy Court that they've
received their first legal bill from the Chapter 11 filing. The
Cleveland legal firm of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue asked for
compensation for $2.43 million in legal fees and $437,125 in
expenses.

<HEAD>Make Computers Easier to Use, Industry Gathering Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Putting the sometimes mind-boggling technological
capabilities of computers into easy-to-use packages is the
industry's major challenge, executives said at a convention.
   ``Our successors ... in the year 2000 should judge us not only on
the technology we brought to the market, but on how we used that
technology to bring the world closer together,'' said Bob Kavner,
who manages data systems and federal systems for the AT&amp;T Group.
   Kavner sounded the call for simplification in his speech opening
Comdex@Spring '90 on Monday. The industry's biannual gathering is
expected to draw 60,000 through Wednesday.
   That sentiment was echoed on the exhibit floor.
   No matter how advanced the technology, ``If people don't turn it
on, it does no good,'' said William Roberts, a sales representative
for Caseworks Inc.
   Caseworks, an Atlanta-based software developer, is one of several
companies at the show that have enthusiastically endorsed Windows
3.0, a software product introduced last month by Microsoft Corp. to
make IBM personal computers easier to use.
   ``Either people will get on this bandwagon or get left behind
very quickly,'' Roberts said.
   Pat Kenealy, publisher of PC World magazine, said Windows was one
of the key software technologies getting a close look. The
convention marks the first time many in the industry have been able
to see the new version of Windows, he said.
   Windows was designed to make IBM personal computers and their
clones as easy to use as Apple Computer's Macintosh.
   ``Over the last three or four years IBM's standard computers have
been tons cheaper than Macintosh but much harder to use. Macintosh
is massively more user-friendly but massively more expensive,''
Kenealy said.
   Caseworks' latest product, the ``Case:W'' engineering tool, was
unveiled on the heels of the Windows introduction and prominently
features the new software.
   Roberts said Caseworks is pushing Windows technology as a way for
companies to get more production out of their workers by simplifying
computers. With Windows, a user with only limited computer knowledge
can perform up to four times as many functions as before, he said.
   ``It makes the computer less intimidating,'' he said.
   The emergence of computer networks, which link computer users and
allow increased sharing of information, was evident on the Comdex
floor as exhibitors jostled to get attention for hundreds of
products aimed at offering heightened compatibility.
   Drawing a sizeable crowd was a demonstration of Wang's ProFound
document manager, which the company says provides access to
documents anywhere on a large, busy network.
   The user in a big corporation, for example, can find a document
with a search based on the content of the paper rather than worrying
about where it was filed, said Christopher Junker, a regional
manager for Wang.

<HEAD>Chevron's Soviet Deal Looks Good, Analysts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet officials and securities analysts
said a Chevron Corp. agreement to study the feasibility of
developing the Soviet Union's vast Tengiz oil field holds great
potential.
   ``This is the kind of asset that if opened up to the West could
be very significant,'' Warren M. Shimmerlik, an oil analyst for
County NatWest USA, said Monday.
   Chevron signed an agreement over the weekend with the Soviet
Ministry of Oil and Gas Industry to study the field, with reserves
estimated at more than 25 billion barrels _ about 2{ times those of
Alaska's Prudhoe Bay.
   The ``protocol of intentions'' is just the first step toward a
joint venture to actually tap the oil. Long negotiations are
expected, and the tangled Soviet bureaucracy could complicate the
matter even if extraction is possible.
   Eugene Nowak, an oil analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said
developing the field near the Caspian Sea appears to be ``a tough
nut. I can imagine the Soviets are going to need some help on this.''
   But he said it appeared to be nothing that Chevron, perhaps
working with Parker Drilling of Tulsa, Okla., couldn't handle
technically.
   ``The uncertainty is that this is a new venture for the Soviets,
and it's the business side that's questionable rather than the
technical side,'' Nowak said.
   However, Soviet oil and gas minister Leonid Filimonov predicted
Monday that a deal to tap the oil field will be signed in the near
future.
   Speaking at a meeting of the American Association of Petroleum
Geologists, he said the proposed partnership will be ``a guarantee
of further development of Soviet-American business ties.''
   The Soviets appear highly motivated to ensure that this and
similar projects take place.
   The Soviet Union is the world's biggest oil producer, but
production has fallen off in recent years, and U.S. technology and
capital are gravely needed to reverse that trend, Shimmerlik said.
   However, he said extraction of the oil appears years away, and
while Chevron may expect a profit, it's unlikely to get a windfall.
   Nowak said there appears to be no way Chevron can lose on the
deal; the worst that could happen is that the venture falls through.

   The stock market continued its steady climb to
new record highs in early trading today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 4.86 to 2,940.05
in the first half hour of trading.
   Advances led declines by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 530 up, 362 down and 511
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 36.1 million shares as of 10 a.m.
on Wall Street.
   Money managers with large cash reserves when the stock market
began moving upward this spring have continued buying stock under
pressure to reap some of the recent reward, sending the market
higher.
   Stocks also appear to be gaining from a decline in interest rates
prompted by the government's report of weak employment figures for
May. Bond prices gained further ground today on news of lower oil
prices.
   Lower bond yields and a softer economy could spur the Federal
Reserve to ease its monetary policy in an effort to stimulate the
economy. That in turn could add impetus to stock market investment.
   Among actively traded blue-chip stocks, Philip Morris was up { to
45; BankAmerica was } higher at 33&rsqb;; American Express was unchanged
at 31|; and Citicorp was \ higher at 24~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was up
0.53 to 200.74. At the American Stock Exchange, the composite index
gained 0.65 to 365.05.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 34.22 to
2,935.19, on top of last week's 80.05-point gain.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 1,101 up, 463 down and 446 unchanged.
   Big Board volume Monday totaled 175.52 million shares, against
187.86 million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Kodak, Five Other Companies Sign Agreement With Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. hopes expanded business
relations with the Soviet Union will allow the photographic giant
eventually to open its familiar photo processing laboratories and
photo stores in five Soviet cities.
   The Rochester-based company is one of six companies in the
American Trade Consortium, which is seeking increased trade with the
Soviet Union.
   As part of the consortium, Kodak hopes to start joint ventures
with the Soviet government for making blood analyzers in Leningrad,
X-ray equipment in Kiev and ink-jet printers in Kursk, and for
distribution of consumer photo products in Leningrad, according to
David Harari, Kodak's general manager for eastern Europe.
   Kodak spokesman Paul C. Allen said Monday that Kodak still has no
go-ahead from the Soviet government on its proposed joint ventures
in the Soviet Union.
   But Allen said Kodak is encouraged by the signing of the new
agreement Saturday by the consortium and the Soviet Foreign Economic
Consortium.
   The new agreement calls for Chevron Corp., an ATC member, and
Tengizneftegaz, a Soviet oil company, to study the possibility of
jointly developing the massive Tengiz oil field in the Kazakh Soviet
Republic in central Asia.
   Because all the oil would be exported, it would generate earnings
in ``hard'' currencies _ U.S. dollars, Japanese yen and other
currencies accepted in international trade _ which Kodak and other
ATC members could swap for ``soft'' Soviet rubles earned in their
ventures.
   Other ATC members are Johnson &amp; Johnson, Archer Daniels Midland
Co., RJR Nabisco Inc. and Mercator Corp., an investment bank.
   In addition to the Chevron deal, the ATC-Soviet agreement defines
a new Accelerated Economic Development Program, which calls for
additional joint ventures to produce consumer goods, medical
equipment and other products.
   The ATC-Soviet agreement ``reprepesents a strong commitment of
American business to participate in the restructuring and
development of the Soviet economy,'' ATC president James Giffen said.

<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. announced Tuesday it
will purchase the Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Arkansas for a total of
about $250 million while selling off its interests in two other
bottlers.
   CCE, the largest bottler of Coca-Cola, said it has agreed in
principle to acquire the Arkansas bottler from the Coca-Cola Co. and
to sell Portsmouth Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Inc. and its majority
interest in Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Ohio.
   The Portsmouth and Ohio companies serve parts of Ohio and
Kentucky, including the cities of Columbus, Toledo and Akron. The
Arkansas bottler serves parts of Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas.
   CCE said the sale of the Portsmouth and Ohio companies to
Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group Inc. will bring a total of about
$120 million and will result in a one-time gain of about $55 million
before taxes.
   The sale of the Ohio bottler is contingent on the acquisition of
the Arkansas company, and all the transactions are contingent on
approval from the companies' boards of directors and various
regulators, the announcement said. The transactions are expected to
be closed before June 30.

   Tomkins PLC has agreed to acquire Philips
Industries Inc. in a stock conversion deal worth about $550 million,
both companies said today.
   Under the agreement in principle, each outstanding share of
Philips common stock would be converted into $18.50 per share in
cash. Philips would be merged with a Tomkins subsidiary.
   Dayton-based Philips makes components for residential, commercial
and industrial buildings; manufactured housing, recreational
vehicles and the transportation industry.
   Tomkins, based in London, is an industrial management company
that owns and operates manufacturing and distribution businesses
primarily in the United States and United Kingdom.
   Tomkins' principal businesses in the United States are The Murray
Ohio Manufacturing Co., which makes power mowers and bicycles, and
Smith &amp; Wesson Corp.
   The agreement is subject to approval by the boards and
shareholders of both companies.
   Spokesmen for Philips and Tomkins were not immediately available
for comment.
   Philips said a proposed reorganization between Philips and
Merrill Lynch Capital Partners from last November was terminated.
Philips said Merrill Lynch's financing sources indicated they would
not participate and that Merrill Lynch did not propose an acceptable
alternative.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Maxwell, the chairman of Maxwell
Communications Corp. PLC, says he is negotiating to buy an
unidentified American newspaper.
   Maxwell, whose interest in buying more papers is widely known,
declined to name the company but said the deal would be worth
``hundreds of millions'' of dollars.
   Maxwell made his comments to reporters Monday after the annual
meeting of one of his companies, Berlitz International Inc., in New
York. A Maxwell spokesman, David Adler, declined to comment further
Tuesday and said Maxwell was in Europe and unavailable for comment.
   ``Maxwell has many deals come across his desk and he's looking at
lots of them all the time. And of course, he has lots of interest in
newspapers,'' Adler said.
   Industry analysts named a few papers that Maxwell could be
targeting, including The Daily News of New York, owned by the
Tribune Co. of Chicago, and The Chicago Sun-Times, which the New
York-based investment firm Adler &amp; Shaykin bought from Rupert
Murdoch in 1986.
   Maxwell reportedly said Monday he would be interested in buying
The Daily News if current contract negotiations reach an impasse.
   Tribune Co. spokeswoman Martha Lindeman said her company does not
comment on rumors of negotiations, as did Leonard Shaykin, a
managing partner of Adler &amp; Shaykin.
   Maxwell owns the London Daily Mirror and recently launched The
European, an English-language newspaper distributed throughout
Europe.
   Two weeks ago, Maxwell announced he planned to buy three U.S.
supermarket tabloids, Globe, National Examiner and Sun, from
Montreal-based Globe International Publishing Inc.
   His biggest acquisition to date in the United States was his $2.6
billion purchase in 1988 of Macmillan Inc., the publishing and
information services company.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Mixed in Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures were mixed in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Corn futures were higher in the wake of corn planting figures
released Monday by the U.S. Agriculture Department. The figures
showed planting 88 percent complete as of Sunday. That was lower
than expected.
   Soybean futures staged a short-lived rebound as traders initially
bought after Monday's steep decline in prices. But prices pulled
back as trading progressed, with analysts citing forecasts of good
weather for planting over the next week for the renewed weakness.
   Weather forecasts for warm, dry conditions in winter wheat
regions, which will promote harvesting and crop development, is
expected to weigh on wheat futures. However, analysts said
followthrough buying from Monday's strong showing, and expectations
that China will tender soon for more export bonus wheat should
support prices.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.30 a bushel; corn was 1\ cents
to 2\ cents higher with July at $2.75 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to
1{ cents higher with July at $1.44 a bushel; soybeans were } cent to
2{ cents lower with July at $5.92 a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Commerical and professional selling tied to a decline in beef
product prices sent cattle futures lower.
   Hog futures were lower as a result of a weak opening of the cash
market. Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .08 cent higher with June
at 74.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .05
cent higher with August at 85 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent
lower to .15 cent higher with June at 66 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .25 cent lower to .13 cent higher with July at 65.15
cents a pound.
   Livestock and pork futures settled higher in Monday's trading.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials from the United States and 16 of its
allies will meet Wednesday to discuss the easing of controls on
high-technology exports to Eastern Bloc countries.
   Formed in 1949, at the start of the Cold War, the Coordinating
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls has served as a watchdog
agency limiting the shipment of strategic technology to Warsaw Pact
nations.
   Known as CoCom, the committee is made up of all NATO member
counties except Iceland, plus Japan and Australia.
   At the two-day meeting, officials of the 17 countries are
expected to approve a relaxation of controls on exports of
telecommunications equipment, computers and machine tools.
   In the past, the United States has been more reluctant than most
of the other members to ease controls. But at a CoCom executive
committee meeting in February _ following the developments in
Eastern Europe _ U.S. officials said they would support total or
partial relaxations of curbs on more than 40 of the 120 regulated
technology categories.
   One new issue facing CoCom is the likelihood of rapid German
unification. West Germany is expected to outline its plans for
dealing with the question of high-technology transfers between East
Germany and the Soviet Union, which are major trading partners.

<HEAD>Saatchi Posts Six-Month Loss, Announces Sale of Big Consulting Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. PLC on Tuesday posted a loss
of $7.7 million for the first six months of the year and announced
it had agreed to sell its largest consulting firm, the Hay Group,
for about $81 million.
   The troubled advertising and communications group blamed the
latest loss on disappointing consulting revenues. The company had
earned $1.68 million in the same period a year ago.
   Saatchi said it had agreed to sell Hay to 135 members of Hay's
management and institutional investors led by CIN Venture Managers
Ltd. of Britain.
   Hay, based in Philadelphia and acquired by the Saatchi for $100
million in 1984, specializes in employee compensation. It employs
more than 2,000 people in 81 offices in 29 countries and has 9,000
clients worldwide.
   Under terms of ths sale, Saatchi would receive $80 million in
cash and a $10 million, 10-year subordinated note paying 10 percent
interest. But Saatchi also has agreed to pay expenses incurred by
the buyers of up to $9 million.
   Saatchi has been seeking for months to sell off Hay and five
other major consulting businesses to focus on its advertising
operations, said a Saatchi spokesman.
   The Hay sale is the first major disposal since it put its
consulting businesses up for sale, and Saathci said the offer from
Hay management was the only firm bid the agency received.
   Saatchi's sales for the six months ended March 31 rose 18 percent
to $4.08 billion from $3.5 billion. Its pre-tax profit fell 29
percent to $24.2 million $33.9 million.
   Saatchi has been suffering from high costs, slower advertising
growth in general and its unsuccessful diversification into
consulting.
   In its latest announcement, the company said it would pay no
dividend for the period compared with a dividend of 12.4 cents a
share paid a year ago.
   It posted a net loss of $98 million for its fiscal year ended
Sept. 30.
   Revenue in the company's communications division, which include
its ad agencies, rose 17 percent in the first half to $655 million.
But the company noted that the figures were enhanced by favorable
currency movements and the transfer of market research activities to
the communications division. Excludig those factors, it said revenue
growth was about 7 percent.
   The division's profit before taxes and other items rose 40
percent to $52 million, buoyed by relatively solid performance in
the United States and Europe.
   However, the company said that the British performance in the
communications sector was disappointing. It said although its client
base continues to grow, some clients were reducing spending.
   ``Despite our strong new business performance, revenue growth
will be muted,'' the company warned. ``We expect the second-half
communications profit performance to be at least as good as the
first half.''
   Consulting revenues slid 3 percent to $193 million. The
operations had a loss before taxes and other items of $1.2 million
compared with a profit of $13.4 million a year earlier.
   The consulting profits were hurt by the company's decision last
year to sell its consulting businesses, the company said. It said
negotiations on the disposal of its remaining consulting operations
continue.
   The figures were converted at the current exchange rate of $1.68
to the pound.

<TEXT>
   Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
acting on a court order, moved striking British Columbia truckers
away from a U.S. border crossing south of Vancouver today.
   Truckers at the Pacific Highway crossing jeered police but there
was no violence, said Sgt. Peter Montague.
   Bob Jones, Western Owner Operators Association spokesman, said
the drivers were served with an injunction shortly before midnight
Monday night, and they felt they had complied with the order by
allowing all truck traffic to proceed, he said. But by daybreak,
officers ordered them to leave the crossing.
   ``They told them either to move or get arrested. If we don't
move, we would get hurt real bad,'' Jones said.
   By midmorning, none of the blockading rigs remained at White
Rock, British Columbia, the town opposite Blaine, Wash. Traffic was
flowing smoothly through the border crossing, though Canadian
customs was kept busy processing a backlog of more than 100 trucks
that had been stuck on the U.S. side.
   ``Everything's moving again,'' said G.R. Greig, a Canadian
customs official.
   Truckers remained at three other crossings.
   The proposed settlement covering 60 of 180 trucking companies
involved in the dispute was announced Monday by Bryan Williams, the
strike's chief mediator for the government of British Columbia.
   Some of the 3,000 independent truckers vowed to continue the
strike they began May 27 if their demands weren't met.
   The blockades since Friday have halted most commercial traffic
across the Canadian border between Washington and British Columbia.
Similar blockades last month caused millions of dollars in losses in
eastern Canada.
   Williams did not disclose terms of Monday's agreement. But Bruce
Butler, a member of the Western Owner Operators Association, which
represents the independent drivers, told the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer it would boost hauling rates to $35 an hour
(Canadian), or $5 less than the strikers sought.
   Butler predicted the offer would be rejected in a vote tonight by
the truckers.
   ``We've been instructed by our executive board to lift the
blockade, but our agreement at the time was supposed to be for $40
an hour. Now they want us to go for $35 and we're saying, `No,' ''
Butler said. ``We're tired of starving to death.''
   Other truckers also were upset by unofficial reports on the
agreement.
   ``I think we've got to stick to our guns here,'' said trucker
Jeffrey Snowden of Victoria.
   ``The $40 per hour rate was non-negotiable,'' said Doug Neal, a
spokesman for striking truckers north of this border town. ``If we
don't get it, we're going to stay here until we do.''
   Trucks carrying fruit, vegetables and other perishables had
temporarily been allowed through the blockades, but all produce
trucks were blocked Monday night, said Dan Murray, a Canada Customs
superintendent at one border stop.
   Passenger cars, buses and trucks carrying medical supplies and
mail have been allowed unrestricted passage throughout the dispute.
   Blockades at four border points and along two major Canadian
highways began in earnest Friday.
   The strike also has drawn support from the Teamsters Union.
   The blockades have resulted in food and fuel shortages in the
province and in Point Roberts, a small Washington state peninsula
that is accessible overland only through British Columbia. They also
forced a Burnaby, British Columbia, truck manufacturer to shut down
Monday for lack of parts from the United States.

<HEAD>Saunders Takes Witness Stand in Guinness Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ernest Saunders, the former chairman of Guinness
PLC, took the witness stand Tuesday as the defense began its case in
the first of two trials resulting from the giant brewer's 1986
takeover of Distillers Co.
   Saunders' lawyer, Richard Ferguson, described his client as the
victim in Britain's largest white-collar scandal. He said the
prosecution's case against Saunders was weak and attempted ``to
substitute quantity for quality.''
   The jury trial, which began Feb. 16, entered its 63rd day
Tuesday. Saunders and six other defendants, are accused of being
involved in a scheme to arrange for the purchase of Guinness stock
during the takeover fight for Distillers, a Scotch whisky and gin
maker.
   The aim of the alleged conspiracy was to boost the price of
Guinness' stock and thus make the company's $4.2 billion cash and
stock bid more attractive than a rival offer from supermarket
operator Argyll Group PLC.
   The takeover succeeded in April 1986, but in December of that
year the Department of Trade and Industry announced it was
investigating, and the alleged financial wrongdoings became public.
   ``The imperative, of course, is to find a scapegoat,'' Ferguson
told the court. ``Something has gone wrong with this great company
... Someone has to carry the can.''
   Ferguson said Saunders, who had to obtain legal aid to cover his
huge legal fees, was testifying voluntarily. Under British law, he
is not required to give evidence on his own behalf.
   ``I could say to you that whatever happens he is a ruined man.
Stripped of the means of earning his livelihood, his personal life
in ruins and himself undermined. Cast aside, we would say, by the
company he served loyally for five years,'' Ferguson said.
   ``But he still has something to fight for and that is his
credibility.''
   Saunders, wearing a navy-blue, double-breasted suit, began his
evidence by giving details of treatment he was having for two
medical complaints, a hernia and a thyroid gland problem. He said he
has separated from his wife and she has moved abroad.
   Standing trial with the 54-year-old Saunders are Gerald Ronson,
51, chairman of Heron International PLC; former stockbroker Anthony
Parnes, 44; and millionaire financier Sir Jack Lyons, 74.
   They face a total of 35 charges including stock manipulation,
theft, false accounting and destroying documents.
   Saunders faces two charges of conspiring to contravene the
Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act; two charges of authorizing or
permitting Guinness to contravene the Companies Act; eight charges
of false accounting; two charges of theft and one charge of
destroying company documents.
   In the second trial, scheduled to begin sometime after October,
the defendants will be Roger Seelig, 44, former Morgan Grenfell &amp;
Co. Ltd. corporate finance director; Lord Patrick Spens, 47, former
director of corporate finance at the merchant bank Henry Ansbacher &amp;
Co. Ltd.; and David Mayhew, 48, senior corporate finance partner of
the investment firm Cazenove &amp; Co.
   The seven men have pleaded innocent to the charges and each is
free on the equivalent of $835,000 in bail.
   U.S. lawyer Thomas Ward has been charged in connection with the
affair and British police are seeking his extradition. Ward has
denied wrongdoing.

<HEAD>Posts Decline in Net Income for 2nd Fiscal Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paramount Communications Inc. said Tuesday its
profit fell 67.7 percent in its second fiscal quarter from results a
year ago that included a big contribution from a financial services
company that has since been sold.
   Paramount said its results from publishing and entertainment were
within expectations, and said it was still on track to achieve its
previously announced forecast of earnings for the fiscal year of
$2.10 to $2.60 a share.
   The company said it earned $21.2 million, or 18 cents per share,
for the three months ended April 30 compared with earnings of $65.6
million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Last's year results included $70.9 million, or 60 cents per
share, in earnings from discontinued operations, mainly from The
Associates, the financial services subsidiary that Paramount sold to
Ford Motor Co. in October.
   Without that contribution, Paramount lost $5.3 million from
continuing operations a year ago.
   Revenue rose 16.2 percent to $812 million from $699 million a
year earlier.
   The latest results included $21.8 million in net interest income
resulting primarily from the investment of the proceeds from the
sale of The Associates. The sale price was $3.35 billion.
   The company said it had significant operating income from
entertainment operations although the results fell short of the
record performance a year earlier.
   Motion picture results were also below last year's results
despite a strong performance by ``The Hunt for Red October'' and the
foreign theatrical popularity of ``Black Rain,'' ``Pet Sematary``
and ``Shirley Valentine.''
   Operating income from television operations approximated the
results of a year ago, paced by the success of ``The Arsenio Hall
Show'' and ``Entertainment Tonight'' and higher syndication revenue
from ``Cheers.''
   Publishing operations results were in line with those of a year
ago. Publishing traditionally posts a loss in the quarter as a
result of the seasonality of educational publishing.
   For the first six months of the year, Paramount earned $42.4
million, or 35 cents a share, down 68.5 percent from $134.8 million,
or $1.13 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 12.9 percent to $1.66 billion from $1.47 billion.

   Fears that creditors would begin repossessing buses
and closing off terminals led strike-bound Greyhound Lines Inc. to
seek protection in federal bankruptcy court, the company says.
   The only nationwide bus system filed for Chapter 11 protection
from its creditors Monday. The move allows Greyhound to continue
operating under court supervision while it tries to reorganize its
finances.
   A hearing has been set for Thursday at 9 a.m. before U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Richard Schmidt in Brownsville.
   ``There will be no interruption of service,'' senior vice
president J. Michael Doyle said.
   The Dallas-based company has seen ridership and revenues plunge
after most of its 6,300 drivers walked out March 2 in a dispute over
wages and job security.
   Meanwhile, Arizona-based Greyhound Dial Corp., which leases some
buses and facilities to the bus company, said today it is charging
$100 million against after-tax earnings to establish a reserve for
possible losses related to Greyhound Lines.
   The company said the actual amount of the loss will be determined
by developments including the bankruptcy proceedings and results of
ongoing business operations.
   ``The bankruptcy (filing) action is a positive, stabilizing move
which should help solidify the troubled position of Greyhound Lines
and go a long way to ensuring the long-term survival of the bus
lines,'' John W. Teets, Greyhound Dial's president and chief
executive officer, said in a statement.
   Greyhound Dial sold the bus lines in 1987 for more than $350
million, but still holds preferred stock and notes from Greyhound
Lines.
   Striking drivers, who maintained that Greyhound Lines had tried
to bust the union at the expense of the company's economic health,
said picketing will continue into the Chapter 11 reorganization.
   ``We're not surprised about the filing because we've been
expecting it all along,'' said Gary H. Daughrity, executive board
member of Local 1313, Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions
in Dallas.
   ``A lot of us can't figure out why it took so long for Greyhound
to seek bankruptcy court protection.''
   One reason that Greyhound's financial woes worsened was that
fewer striking drivers crossed picket lines than company management
had anticipated, Daughrity said.
   The company has hired about 3,000 replacement drivers and claims
to have restored service to locations that provided 98 percent of
revenues last year.
   But the drop in ridership and the cost of fighting the sometimes
violent strike drained the company's cash, including a strike fund
estimated at more than $54 million.
   Greyhound blamed the strike for much of its $56 million
first-quarter loss. The company also has missed more than $17
million in interest, lease and principal payments, putting it in
default on many financial agreements.
   ``In the past few days, there has been a lot of pressure by
creditors'' who own buses and terminals and lease them to Greyhound,
said President Frank Schmieder.
   Under the lease agreements, those owners can repossess buses
immediately after a missed payment. Spokesman George Gravley said
the company was concerned about possible action by owners of leases
on 500 to 1,000 of the company's 3,800 buses.
   ``While most (creditors) have been cooperative, we were faced
with the threat of a `run on assets' that would have crippled our
ability to operate,'' Doyle said.
   Greyhound filed its petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Brownsville. The filing also includes five affiliated companies:
Eagle Bus Manufacturing Co., GLI Bus Operations Holding Co.,
BusLease Inc., Trailways Commuter Transit Inc. and GLI Food Services
Inc. Greyhound's parent, GLI Holding Co., was not included.
   Greyhound has reported scores of shootings, bomb threats and
incidents of vandalism since the strike began. A striking driver in
Redding, Calif., was killed on the second day of the walkout after
being crushed by a bus driven by a replacement.
   Talks stalled under the company's demand that a week pass without
violence first. The two sides did meet on May 5, but the union
balked at Greyhound's insistence on retaining its newly hired
drivers and changing from a mileage-based to an hourly wage scale.
   On May 7, Chairman Fred G. Currey said the strike had become
``irrelevant'' because the carrier had enough drivers to operate.
   Two weeks later, however, the company proposed repurchasing $225
million of its junk bonds at a steep discount to avert bankruptcy.
   Schmieder said negotiations are continuing on a debt buyback, but
``it will take longer now because the courts will have to approve
any financial restructuring.''
   The company's total debt stood at $384 million at the end of
March. The debt is the legacy of a $270 million leveraged buyout led
by Currey three years ago that took the company private. A few
months later, the group paid $80 million for Dallas-based Trailways
Lines Inc.

   The stock market was mixed today in heavy
trading, with the Dow Jones average slightly lower but overall
enthusiasm continuing.
   The Dow average of 30 industrials was down 4.12 to 2,931.07 at
noon on Wall Street. The average gained about 12 points after the
opening bell on carryover strength from Monday, when the Dow rose
34.22 to a new record high 2,935.19.
   But overall, advances led declines by about 10 to 9 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 781 up, 712
down and 502 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 145.98 million shares at 2 p.m.
on Wall Street.
   Analysts attributed the drop in the Dow to scattered selling to
take profits after a runup that has seen the market barometer soar
290.14 points, or 10.97 percent, from April 27 through Monday.
   ``Some of these stocks have just run a little too fast, but we're
really not getting much selling today,'' said Dudley Eppel, head of
equity trading at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   A flat bond market also contributed to the mixed atmosphere. Bond
prices rose sharply and interest rates declined _ good for stocks _
in a rally late last week.
   Analysts said despite today's fallback enthusiasm about the
market reaching further highs remains.
   ``Buyers are attempting to get on board a market that continues
to move ahead, but with some caution,'' said Alan Ackerman, market
strategist with Gruntal &amp; Co.
   Money managers with large cash reserves when the stock market
began moving upward this spring have bought stock in recent days,
helping send the market to new highs in recent days.
   Declines in several major oil stocks because of falling oil
prices offset continued gains in financial issues. Airlines,
benefitting from the potential for cheaper jet fuel, also fared well.

   The market opened strongly, recording a gain of 19.9 points at

   They also said a sharp drop in oil prices and a lower bond market
contributed to today's decline. Bond prices rose sharply and
interest rates declined _ good for stocks _ in a rally late last

   But some market players predicted the decline was merely a pause
before a further jump because of heavy volume and general enthusiasm.
   ``This market is very reluctant to come down,'' said Jack

   Qintex Entertainment Inc., a
television production and distribution firm, will sell its operating
assets for more than $65 million in two transactions, it was
announced today.
   Qintex Entertainment said in a statement its board of directors
had agreed to sell its entertainment assets to RHI Entertainment for
$42.4 million.
   RHI Entertainment will receive the Qintex library, accounts
receivable, development projects and other assets under the deal.
   Under another agreement, certain assets of HR Broadcasting will
be sold to ABRY Communications for $40 million in cash. The funds
will be available for distribution to HR Broadcasting creditors and
shareholders.
   Qintex said it expects to receive at least $23 million from the
distribution.
   HR Broadcasting will sell its primary operating assets, which
consist of television stations WTTO in Birmingham, Ala., and WCGV in
Milwaukee, Wis. The broadcasting company will retire its bank debt
and make distributions to its creditors and shareholders.
   Qintex Entertainment filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code last October. Both agreements are subject to
approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and various other regulatory
approvals.
   Qintex Australia Limited, which last year made an unsuccessful
attempt to take over MGM-UA Communications, owns a 43 percent stake
in Qintex Entertainment.
   In September, Qintex Australia Limited offered $1.5 billion for
MGM-UA. The deal fell through when Qintex failed to make a $50
million downpayment.
   MGM-UA announced in March it had accepted a $1.2 billion buyout
offer by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti's Pathe Communications
Corp.

<TEXT>
   Coors Brewing Co. has forged a deal with Stroh
Brewery Co. to purchase Stroh's Memphis, Tenn., facility _ an
aquisition marking the first time Coors will make beer outside of
Golden, Co., officials said Tuesday.
   The companies said they hoped to complete the transaction by July
3, but Stroh said it would operate the 500-employee breery until
Sept. 1. The brewery sale price was not disclosed.
   ``This purchase is part of our overall strategy to position Coors
Brewing Co. for future growth,'' said Peter Coors, president of
Golden-based Coors Brewing. ``It will provide the additional
capacity we need to respond to rising consumer demand for our
products.''
   Coors Brewing Co. earlier reported shipping a record 3.9 million
barrels of beer during the first quarter of this year, when it also
reported record net sales of $394 million. The Memphis brewery, with
an annual brewing capacity of 5.5 million barrels, will increase
Coors' annual production by nearly a third.
   Adolph Coors Co., the parent company of Coors Brewing founded in
1873 by German immigrant Adolph Coors, this year surpassed
Detroit-based Stroh as the nation's No. 3 brewer with a 9 percent
market share.
   Anheuser-Busch, with its 42 percent share, and Miller Brewing Co.
with its 22 percent share, were the top brewers.
   Coors last year produced 17.7 million barrels of beer. The
company ships some to its satellite packaging facility in Elkton,
Va., which has a packaging capacity of 2.5 million barrels.
   The announcement comes less than a week after Anheuser-Busch
accused Coors of engaging in ``false and deceptive'' advertising by
implying that its products contain only ``Rocky Mountain spring
water.'' Anheuser-Busch complained to the Federal Trade Commission
that Coors ships beer concentrates to its Elkton facility, where
local water is added.
   Coors replied that 14 percent of its beer was shipped last year
as concentrate to Elkton, where water and carbonation were added
before packaging. But the company said all its beer is brewed with
Rocky Mountain spring water.
   Coors will assume Stroh's collective bargaining agreement with
the Memphis brewery's hourly employees when it takes over. Salaried
employees will be notified later about employment opportunities with
Coors, Stroh said Tuesday.
   Coors Brewing spokeswoman Carey Baird said the company would not
discuss plans for the Memphis brewery until the transaction was
completed.
   The Memphis brewery is one of six owned and operated by Stroh.
The breweries employ about 4,500 workers and have a total capacity
of about 24 million barrels a year.
   Stroh began looking for partners in February 1989 amid financial
struggles that resulted in more than 300 layoffs and sales of some
properties and divisions, including an ice-cream business.
   Stroh agreed to sell most of its beer business to Coors for $425
million last fall, but the agreement fell apart in December.
   Officials of both companies have refused to discuss details of
the failed buyout such as whether the price or antitrust
considerations were stumbling blocks.
   Neither Baird nor Stroh spokeswoman Lacey Logan would comment on
whether the current deal indicated the companies were conducting
further negotiations. Stroh President Roger Fridholm indicated in
May that Stroh was attempting to position itself to continue
independent operation.
   Peter Stroh, Stroh chairman and chief executive officer, said
selling the Memphis brewery ``will permit us to effectively
consolidate our production into our remaining five breweries.''
   Peter Coors said the Memphis plant is ``strategically located,
and it has a solid infrastructure and work force in place. That
makes it an excellent fit for us.''

   Sikorsky Aircraft announced Tuesday that
it is developing a bicycle-sized, pilotless air vehicle for the
Defense Department.
   The six-foot wide, disk-shaped vehicle, dubbed the ``Cypher,''
will be used for ground and naval surveillance and for relaying
communications, Sikorsky said.
   The craft is designed to take off vertically in a small area and
to hover relatively motionless, even in windy conditions. It is
being tested at wind tunnels in the United Technologies Research
Center in East Hartford, Conn.
   Possible uses not related to defense missions include anti-drug
efforts, forestry, work needed by utility companies, and
search-and-rescue missions, Sikorsky said.
   A preliminary, slightly smaller version of the craft has been
tested at Sikorsky's West Palm Beach, Fla., facility. The company is
now testing the craft at two locations in Connecticut.
   Until about two months ago, the project was considered classified
by the Defense Department, and Sikorksy had not released any
information about it, said Sikorsky spokesman William Tuttle.
   Sikorsky, a division of UTC, is best known as the pioneer of the
helicopter industry.

<HEAD>Dallas and Stamford Stores Being Closed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bloomingdale's said Tuesday its poorly performing
branch stores in Dallas and Stamford, Conn. will close late this
summer.
   Marvin S. Traub, chairman of Bloomingdale's, said the decision to
close the two branches came after a regular chainwide review of
financial performance and future potential.
   ``As part of this review, we concluded that it is no longer
appropriate for Bloomingdale's to remain in these locations,'' he
said.
   The New York-based department store operator has been under
intense pressure to generate sales and income. Its parent company,
Campeau Corp.-owned Federated Department Stores Inc., is trying to
reorganize under bankruptcy court supervision.
   The older of the two Bloomingdale's, the one in Stamford, opened
for business in 1954 and will close on Aug. 18. The Dallas store has
been in operation since 1983 and will close on Sept. 8.
   Together in recent years, the Dallas and Stamford branches have
accounted for an almost insignificant 4.5 percent of the 17-store
chain's annual sales. By contrast, sales at the main store in New
York City represent one-third of the chain's annual volume.
   Traub said efforts will be made to make the transition easier for
employees and customers.
   Stamford personnel will be given the opportunity to transfer to
stores in New York and New Jersey. The Stamford store has 151
full-time, 200 part-time, and 43 management employees.
   Bloomingdale's owns the property where the Stamford store is
located. No decision has been made on whether the site will be sold
or rented.
   The Dallas employees will be offered counseling and job placement
services. Interviews with other area retailers will be held at the
Dallas Bloomingdale's, the chain's only branch in Texas. The store
in Valley View Mall has 229 full-time, 176 part-time and 27
management employees. Bloomingdale's rents the Valley View Mall site.
   The closing announcements were made to staff Tuesday morning.
   After briefing employees at the Dallas store, Richard Hauser,
Bloomingdale's regional vice president, said that lagging sales due
to difficult economic conditions led to the decision to shut the
store.
   ``The ... store opened at a high level of volume in 1983. Despite
a strong start, changes in local market conditions since we opened
have caused our volume to decline substantially,'' Hauser said in a
brief statement to reporters after the employee meeting.
   He did not elaborate.
   Ann Stock, spokeswoman at the Bloomingdale's headquarters in New
York, said the economies in both Dallas and Stamford have been
difficult for retailing.
   She said the decision to exit those markets was not precipitated
by any extra pressure from Bloomingdale's Cincinnati-based owner,
Federated.
   Federated, along with its sister company Allied Stores Corp.,
have been operating under bankruptcy court protection from creditors
since January. Heavy debts incurred when they were acquired by
Canada's Campeau caused them to seek refuge under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code.
   In the hope of raising cash, Federated had been looking for
buyers for the entire Bloomingdale's chain. Last month, the chain
was taken off the auction block. Retail analysts say they suspect
Federated grew frustrated when it didn't receive high enough offers.
   Despite the financial problems of Federated, Traub has said
Bloomingdale's remains committed to its expansion and renovation
plans. In Tuesday's announcement, he outlined a series of store
openings and refurbishments currently on the drawing board.
   A new branch is scheduled to open this autumn in Palm Beach
Gardens in West Palm Beach, Fla. Negotiations are underway on two
possible new stores, in suburban Chicago's Old Orchard and in the
Mall of America in Minneapolis. Renovations are planned at the
chain's flagship New York City store as well as at branches in Short
Hills, N.J. and Boston, Mass.
   Traub suggested Bloomingdale's could someday return to the Dallas
and Stamford markets. Bloomingdale's considers ``both markets to be
viable for future stores and we remain open to exploring other
options in these areas,'' he said.

   Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., the nation's
largest producer of corporate and business jets, is developing a
device to reduce jet engine noise on commercial airlines, the
company's chairman said Tuesday.
   Allen E. Paulson said he has filed for a patent on the device,
which he said will ``extend the life of planes, cut the operating
costs and help meet government regulations.''
   He said it could be in production within two years.
   Paulson made the announcement at the opening session of the
company's annual owners and operators workshop.
   He did not provide details on how the device will work, but said
he finalized its design earlier this year.
   ``I worked on it to be applied first to Gulfstream IIs and IIIs,
but it can be adapted to most all of the existing airliners in
operation,'' he said.
   The device would fill a need created by a growing federal push
for noise abatement around major airports, he said, and could ``open
up a whole new ballgame'' for Savannah-based Gulfstream.

   Stock prices fell today, countering a recent
rally that produced record highs.
   Analysts attributed the decline to scattered selling to take
profits after a runup in the Dow Jones industrial average of more
than 10 percent since late April.
   A sharp drop in crude oil prices and a weaker bond market
contributed to the selloff. Bond prices rose sharply and interest
rates declined _ good for stocks _ in a rally late last week.
   Declines in several major oil and oilfield industry stocks
because of lower oil prices offset gains in financial issues.
Airlines, benefitting from the potential for cheaper jet fuel, also
fared well.
   But some market players predicted that the decline was just a
pause before a further jump.
   Money managers with large cash reserves when the market began
moving upward have bought stock in recent days, boosting the market
to its new highs. That enthusiasm was not seen as waning today.

<HEAD>Search Begins for Noyce's Successor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sematech officials pledged to continue
efforts to make the United States preeminent in high-technology
despite the loss of Sematech leader Robert Noyce, but industry
analysts and politicians said the research group cannot get
complacent about its federal funding.
   Noyce, 62, known internationally as a founding father of the
Silicon Valley and co-inventor of the integrated circuit, died
Sunday morning of cardiac arrest.
   He was chairman of Sematech _ the Austin-based research group of
14 technology companies, which includes International Business
Machines Corp., American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., Texas
Instruments Inc. and Motorola Inc.
   He commanded respect in the high-tech industry and had the
political skills to win points in Washington. He became the major
national spokesman for government intervention in the semiconductor
war with Japan.
   Directors of the consortium are stepping up their effort to
replace Noyce.
   ``The board understands that it must resolve this issue
expeditiously,'' said Charles Sporck, Sematech's board chairman and
head of the search committee.
   In the interim, Sematech will be run by two men who Noyce
frequently left in charge of day-to-day operations: Chief Operating
Office Turner Hasty, 59, a veteran researcher and business executive
who came to Sematech from Texas Instruments; and Chief
Administrative Officer Peter Mills, 39, a former computer executive
and a former Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce executive.
   Sematech leaders and U.S. Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, spoke to
Sematech employees Monday.
   Pickle, a key backer of the research project, assured workers
that Sematech's requested $100 million in federal funds for 1991
remained strong. Sematech receives half its $200 million annual
budget from the government and the remaining funds from its member
companies.
   The unprecedented private-public venture has provoked some
criticism in Congress, but the Bush administration has proposed
continued funding for Sematech for the 1991 fiscal year, which
starts in October.
   But Pickle cautioned that Sematech cannot let its guard down and
must move quickly to fill the top job.
   ``They need to get the best person as quickly as they can, so
they can move forward with the program,'' the Austin
American-Statesman reported Tuesday.
   Finding someone of Noyce's caliber won't be easy, said Dan
Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research in San Jose, Calif. ``A man
like Noyce comes along maybe once every two centuries,'' Hutcheson
said.
   ``They are going to have to have to look long and hard to find
someone of his stature and background to take it over,'' he said.
   Robert Galvin, former chief executive of Motorola Inc., said
Sematech will thrive because of Noyce's legacy. ``Bob Noyce has
invested well and the fundamentals are all there,'' he said.

   The dollar ended mostly lower Tuesday in
worldwide foreign exchange trading, reflecting continued concern
about the direction of interest rates.
   Gold prices rose following a mixed performance overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $359.80 a troy ounce, up $1.20 from late Monday.
Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at
$359 an ounce, $1.60 higher.
   Currency dealers said worries about the effects of a reunified
Germany were lending some suppport to the dollar, but that was being
overidden by interest-rate fears.
   Recent reports showing sluggish economic growth have some dealers
worried that the Federal Reserve might be loosening its credit grip,
they said. Lower interest rates often depress a currency.
   Economic data due out next week could shed more light on the
economy's direction, including reports on consumer and producer
prices for May.
   In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar rose 0.01 yen
to close at 152.43 yen. It traded at 152.55 yen in London, and at
152.35 yen in New York, down from 152.65 yen Monday.
   The dollar weakened against the British pound. Sterling bought
$1.6820 in London, up from $1.6745 Monday, and $1.6880 in New York,
up from $1.6770 Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
quotes, included: 1.6840 West German marks, down from 1.6905; 1.4280
Swiss francs, down from 1.4340; 5.6785 French francs, down from
5.6960; 1,240.00 Italian lire, down from 1,243.00; and 1.17605
Canadian dollars, up from 1.17475.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Monday: 1.6910 West
German marks, down from 1.6940; 1.4340 Swiss francs, down from
1.4390; 5.7020 French francs, down from 5.7080; 1.9070 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.9068; 1,244.25 Italian lire, down from 1,245.50;
and 1.1752 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1763.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid price of $359.25 an ounce, up
from $356.05 Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $358.60 an ounce, down from $363
late Friday. Zurich markets were closed Monday for a religious
holiday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 81 cents to close at $359.87 an
ounce.
   Silver prices strengthened. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $5.065 a troy ounce, up 1.6 cents

<DATELINE>DANVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whirlpool Corp. and a leading Japanese
producer of consumer and electronic goods announced Tuesday they
have signed a joint venture to produce vacuum cleaners for the North
American market.
   The joint venture of Whirlpool, which is based in Benton Harbor,
Mich., and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. of Osaka, Japan,
will own and operate Whirlpool's vacuum manufacturing plant in
Danville.
   According to the announcement, Whirlpool will assist the joint
venture in maintaining and expanding its floor care product business
relationship with Sears, Roebuck and Co. The plant in Danville
produces a full line of canister, upright and central vacuum
cleaners for Sears under the Kenmore brand name.
   Whirlpool will have continued management involvement to assure
continuity in marketing and manufacturing, and the company also will
have representation on the board of directors. Whirlpool will report
an after-tax gain on the sale of an interest in the joint venture at
the time of closing.
   Matsushita currently imports Panasonic brand vacuum cleaners to
the United States and is expected to use the Kentucky facility to
expand its manufacturing and marketing base in North America.
   Matsushita is the world's leading manufacturer of consumer and
industrial electronics products, with annual sales of nearly $38
billion. It has production facilities and sales offices in 38
countries and 198,000 employees worldwide. The company markets
14,000 different electronics products under the Panasonic, Technics,
Quasar and National brand names.
   Whirlpool is the world's leading manufacturer and marketer of
major home appliances. The company manufactures in 10 countries and
markets products under nine major brand names in more than 45
countries.
   On Feb. 9, Whirlpool announced that it was planning to sell its
Danville plant and the floor-care operation there.
   Whirlpool said it decided to sell the floor-care operation
because it didn't have the resources other companies had for
continued growth and profitability in the long term. The company
said it had decided to concentrate on the manufacture of trash
compactors and ice makers.
   Whirlpool already has begun the phase-out of its two other major
operations _ trash compactors and ice makers _ at the Danville
plant. The operations are being moved to other Whirlpool plants.
   Some 250 of Whirlpool's 1,000 Danville employees are involved in
the manufacture of trash compactors and another 50 are involving in
making ice makers. The rest are assigned to the floor care division.

   Energy futures fell Tuesday amid concerns over
reports that Saudi Arabia planned to cut oil prices.
   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 46 cents to $16.68 a 42-gallon barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Other contract months also
dropped.
   John Hill, an energy broker at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said the fall
began Monday on news Saudi Arabia was lowering prices for July
contracts. He said ``people are a little concerned there could be
further cuts down the road.''
   Among refined products traded on the mercantile exchange,
wholesale gasoline for delivery in July tumbled 1.76 cents to 57.82
cents a gallon, with subsequent months also falling.
   The July contract for home heating oil fell .48 cents to 47.11
cents a gallon. Later months also declined.
   Natural gas prices dropped from $1.582 per 1,000 cubic feet to
$1.567 Tuesday.
   William Byers, an analyst with Bear Stearns &amp; Co., said the crude
market also was driven by supply numbers suggesting that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had not cut production
as much as they had intended.
   That would create oversupply in the market, depressing the price
of crude oil. Byers also said U.S. supplies are at capacity levels,
pressuring prices even further.

<HEAD>Reports of Saudi Discounting Send Crude Oil Futures Sharply Lower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices fell sharply Tuesday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange on reports that Saudi Arabia is selling crude
oil at discount prices to its major customers.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures were mostly higher,
precious metals climbed, copper rallied, and livestock and pork
futures rose sharply.
   Analysts said Saudi Arabia may be selling crude at a discount
because of its displeasure with OPEC's failure to be faithful to
production quotas.
   According to Randolph Donney, a research analyst with Merrill
Lynch in New York, the Saudis are discounting as much as 75 cents a
barrel. He says it appears they are willing to let the price to dip
below $15 a barrel.
   ``That will stun a number of countries who depend on oil to keep
their economies afloat,'' Donney said.
   Last month, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries agreed to reduce crude oil output to just over 22 million
barrels a day. Donney said the 13 OPEC countries are currently
producing 23.5 million barrels per day.
   Once again gasoline futures were battered, a bad sign for the
market because gasoline usually leads the market at this time of
year, Donney said, adding that the driving season got underway with
the Memorial Day weekend, which usually triggers higher gasoline
prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 14 cents to 49 cents lower
with July at $16.68 a barrel; heating oil was .48 cent to .76 cent
lower with July at 47.11 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .90
cent to 1.76 cents lower with July at 57.82 cents a gallon.
   Grain futures prices were higher and soybeans were mixed on the
Chicago Board of Trade, with corn futures sharply higher as planting
continues to lag.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a report at the close
of trading Monday that said planting of the corn crop was 88 percent
complete as of Sunday. That is less than expected, taking into
account that there were several days of clear weather last week,
said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in
Chicago.
   Soggy fields in recent weeks delayed the planting of corn in
several Midwestern states.
   Also helping corn prices was the USDA's export inspection report
which showed a pickup in demand for the grain.
   Wheat futures were higher on indications the People's Republic of
China will bid for 500,000 metic tons of wheat under the export
bonus program. The USDA on Tuesday accepted a bid for bonus wheat
from South Korea.
   Soybean prices were mixed as professional selling blunted a rally.
   Wheat was a { cent to 1{ cents higher with July at $3.32{ a
bushel; corn was 4{ cents to 5{ cents higher with July at $2.78\ a
bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 5\ cents higher with July at $1.46{ a
bushel; and soybeans were a { cents lower to 1{ cents higher with
July at $5.92} cents a bushel.
   Precious metals were higher in trading on the New York Commodity
Exchange.
   The rally in precious metals was paced by platinum, which rose on
reports of heavy buying by the Japanese, said Bette Raptopoulos, an
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Gold futures rose as the dollar weakened against major foreign
currencies, which also helped silver prices.
   Gold was $1.20 to $1.30 higher with June at $359.80 a troy ounce;
silver was 1.4 cents to 1.6 cents higher with June at $5.065 a troy
ounce; platinum was $5.50 to $5.80 higher with June at $491.80 a
troy ounce.
   Copper prices were higher on the Comex as demand for June copper
spurred a sharp rally.
   There was no news to account for the sharp rise in copper prices,
but there is the perception that near-term supplies are tight, Ms.
Raptopoulos said.
   Copper was 1.30 cents to 2.90 cents higher with June at $1.171 a
pound.
   Livestock and pork futures were higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, with pork belly futures up the daily trading limit on news
the Soviet Union is interested in using U.S. credit guarantees to
buy meat.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .30 cent higher with June at 74.97
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent lower to .05 cent higher
with August at 84.97 cents a pound; hogs were .52 cent to 1.37 cents
higher with June at 66.77 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.95 cent to 2 cents higher with July at 67.30 cents a pound.

   National Intergroup Inc. on Tuesday said it
will move its headquarters to Dallas and its chairman, Howard Love,
will resign.
   The holding company, formerly the majority owner of National
Steel Corp., said it will change its name to FoxMeyer Corp., the
name of its drug distribution company.
   Love, 59, will recommend to National Intergroup's board that he
be replaced by FoxMeyer head Robert L. King.
   National Intergroup also said it would sell its Ben Franklin
Stores Inc. subsidiary, and it would either sell, spin off or seek a
partner for a joint venture for its Permian Partners oil business.
   The company also sold aluminum assets and announced on Monday the
sale of its Genix Enterprises computer company in Robinson Township,
Allegheny County.
   The Genix sale, if approved, would leave FoxMeyer as National
Intergroup's sole remaining operating division.
   The company said it would buy back stock or pay a dividend with
cash from the sales.
   In March, National Intergroup sold 40 percent of its 50 percent
share in National Steel, the nation's sixth largest steel producer
last year.
   The company employs about 50 people in Pittsburgh.
   Centaur Partners, a New York investment group, earlier this year
tried unsuccessfully to gain control of National Intergroup's board.
The partnership, which owns one-sixth of NII, said it was
disappointed in National Intergroup's management and recent earnings.
   National Intergroup spokesman Edward Klein said Tuesday's moves
did not represent appeasement of Centaur Partners.

<HEAD>Feds Support Canadian Pacific Bid for D&amp;H Railway</HEAD>

   Federal Railroad Administrator Gilbert E.
Carmichael announced his support Tuesday for a $25 million bid by
Canadian Pacific Ltd. to buy the ailing Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway.
   ``Canadian Pacific Railroad and the D&amp;H is more than just saving
1,600 miles of track. It creates another major eastern U.S.A., North
American railroad for the Western railroads to do business with,''
Carmichael said at a news conference in the office of Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   D'Amato, who also endorsed Canadian Pacific's bid, said the
Justice Department would file a supporting brief at a D&amp;H hearing
Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.
   ``With the federal government asking the court to approve the
sale, we have cleared another major hurdle to save the D&amp;H,''
D'Amato said.
   The Federal Railroad Administrator is D&amp;H's largest creditor,
with more than $90 million in secured claims.
   Last month, the D&amp;H's bankruptcy trustee accepted Canadian
Pacific's bid, which also promises about $5 million for the trustee
if Canadian Pacific can sell rights to run fiber optic
communications cables along the D&amp;H right-of-way.
   The deal is contingent on agreements by the D&amp;H's 14 unions with
the Canadian Pacific before mid-July.
   D'Amato said Tuesday that tentative accords had been reached with
all the unions but Canadian Pacific spokesman John Cox said the
senator was mistaken. The only tentative agreement was with the
United Transportation Union, the largest of the group, Cox said.
   He declined to divulge details of the accord until the rank and
file vote on it later this week.
   Cox also hesitated when asked whether federal support for
Canadian Pacific's bid might sway Judge Balick.
   ``I would not like to be in a position of suggesting what will
make up the judge's mind for her,'' he said, adding that she ``must
be aware of the public support'' for Canadian Pacific's bid.
   Canadian Pacific's $25 million bid is $10 million less than it
had offered earlier this year. Canadian Pacific withdrew it in
February after the carrier was unable to secure trackage rights
between Hagerstown, Md., and Harrisburg, Pa. Those tracks belong to
Consolidated Rail Corp., which refused to negotiate.
   The new offer is for rolling stock, 600 miles of D&amp;H-owned track
and running rights over 900 miles of track of other lines. Canadian
Pacific owns about 14,000 miles of track in Canada and 5,000 in the
United States.
   The D&amp;H, the nation's oldest continually operated railroad, filed
in June 1988 for protection from its creditors. The railroad runs
from Montreal to Washington, D.C., and from Albany to Buffalo, N.Y.

   Bankers are paying more attention to the
impact of environmental concerns on their industry and on business
in general, participants in a worldwide banking convention said
Tuesday.
   When banks are asked to finance a factory or other industrial
operation, they increasingly explore the potential environmental
impact of the project before giving approval, said R. Donald
Fullerton, chairman and chief executive of Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce.
   ``We're in an early learning process,'' he told reporters at the
International Monetary Conference. ``We are paying more attention to
the kinds of projects we are financing'' for potential environmental
impact, he said. Fullerton called such concern ``a reasonably new
development.''
   Another concern for banks is the environmental impact of their
own operations, said Fullerton, who was chairman of a panel on the
environment at the annual banking convention.
   ``We have a massive paper-generating machine that we need to deal
with,'' he said, without offering a solution.
   Fullerton said the bankers at the closed-door meetings agreed
``that the environment was a major issue that the banking community
will have to pay attention to.''
   For industry in general, ``the environmental aspects have become
a new bottom line,'' said one of the panelists, Alex Krauer,
chairman and managing director of Ciba-Geigy Ltd. of Basel,
Switzerland.
   ``We are part of the problem, but also want to be part of the
solution,'' Krauer told reporters.
   At their private session, the bankers heard an address by Frank
Press, president of the National Academy of Sciences, who said he
believes business executives are genuinely concerned about the
impact of their operations on the environment, according to a text
of his speech.
   ``I don't think I am being unfair if I observe that 20 years ago
many companies treated environmental concerns as something to
ignore, deflect or fight,'' he said. ``Today, their perceptions and
actions have changed greatly.''

   Greyhound Lines officials said they did not
experience any major runs on requests for refunds on Tuesday, the
day after the nation's only intercity bus line filed for
reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws.
   Spokeswoman Liz Hale said customers who want refunds should go to
their local Greyhound ticket office.
   The tickets have to be forwarded to Greyhound headquarters, and a
refund will be mailed, Ms. Hale said.
   Some special Greyhound fares are non-refundable, she said.

<HEAD>Eastern Seeks Approval to Acquire Commuter Airline</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A commuter airline appeared to be saved from
shutdown under a proposed agreement Tuesday for Eastern Airlines to
acquire full control of the carrier's operations in Florida and the
Bahamas.
   The plan calls for Miami-based Eastern to purchase 59 percent of
Bar Harbor Airways from sister carrier Continental Airlines and
expand its commuter service.
   Eastern, which already owns 41 percent of Bar Harbor, operates
the Florida service as its Eastern Express subsidiary, said
spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.
   No price was announced for Eastern's acquisition of Continental's
share, said Ms. Ceremsak.
   Under the pact, Continental would take over Bar Harbor's
operations in the Northeast. The carrier presently has 148 daily
flights under the Continental Express logo from hubs in Newark,
N.J., New York's La Guardia Airport and Boston.
   Because Eastern will only receive Bar Harbor's smaller southern
operations, Continental will pay the carrier $3 million and also
forgive all debt owed by Bar Harbor, said Peggy Mahoney, a
spokeswoman at Houston-based Continental Express.
   The deal, if approved, would settle all claims by Eastern against
Bar Harbor or Continental in connection with Bar Harbor operations,
said Ms. Ceremsak.
   Bar Harbor, facing growing competition from American Airlines and
Pan Am World Airways commuter services, had planned to halt its
southern flights on Sunday.
   ``This plan averts the closing and we have plans to expand,''
said Ms. Ceremsak.
   Eastern plans to maintain Bar Harbor's present 47 daily flights
from Miami to 11 cities in Florida and the Bahamas. Also, Eastern
said it plans to increase Miami service and add flights from Key
West to Fort Myers and Naples.
   All 300 Bar Harbor employees in Florida and the Bahamas will keep
their jobs under Eastern Express, the carrier said.
   Eastern said it may increase its commuter operation to more than
70 daily departures to 16 cities by late summer.
   The plan must receive approval from the U.S. Department of
Transportation and U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. Eastern filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection shortly after a strike by
Machinists, pilots and flight attendants in March 1989.
   Martin Shugrue, the court-appointed trustee overseeing Eastern,
said the Bar Harbor deal is part of a strategy to ``preserve our
long-term Florida presence.''
   But Eastern will also face competition from other carriers
seeking to feed their Miami hubs with commuter flights.
   American operates 33 flights from Miami under American Eagle and
plans aggressive expansion in coming years. Pan Am Express began
service with 25 flights from Miami last month and hopes to add up to
five more destinations this fall.

   Stock prices declined Tuesday in heavy trading,
pulling back from a rally that pushed the Dow Jones industrial
average to new heights.
   The Dow average of 30 large corporate stocks fell 10.19 to
2,925.00, returning about one third of the Monday gains that left
the key market barometer at a record 2,935.19.
   Analysts attributed the drop to selling of some blue-chip stocks
to make profits, sharply lower oil prices and a weaker bond market.
But they said the decline did not appear to dampen the enthusiasm in
the market's spring surge.
   ``I think it's a natural consequence of a straight up move we've
had here for three weeks,'' said Dudley Eppel, head of equity
trading for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   Declining issues edged out advances in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 774 up, 813 down and 463
unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 199.72 million
shares, up from 175.52 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 241.4 million shares.
   Some market participants said the decline was a pause before a
further jump with no sign of a broadly based selloff. The rally has
been fed in part by stock-buying by money managers with large cash
reserves who want to join the upward trend.
   ``This market is very reluctant to come down,'' said Jack
Solomon, technical analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. ``There's a
certain buoyancy here. Even as we correct one area another area can
act well.''
   Oil and oilfield industry stocks were battered by a drop of 46
cents per 42-gallon barrel in the July contract of West Texas
Intermediate crude oil.
   Baker Hughes dropped 2 to 27|; Halliburton tumbled 2} to 46\; and
Schlumberger dropped 2} to 55}. Of blue-chip oil stocks, Exxon was
unchanged at 48\; Atlantic Richfield fell } to 118\; Texaco dropped
| to 59&rsqb;; and Amoco lost | to 52}.
   A drop in bond prices, which pushed interest rates higher, also
weighed on stocks. Bond prices rose sharply and interest rates
declined _ good for stocks _ in a rally late last week.
   The Big Three automakers lost ground after reporting a 6.7
percent sales decline in late May compared with the same year-ago
period. Chrysler fell } to 15~; Ford was off | to 47&rsqb; and General
Motors dropped { to 49~.
   Airline stocks got a boost on the perception that jet fuel prices
could decline. AMR, parent of American Airlines, gained 1&rsqb; to 68~,
and Delta rose | to 80.
   Financial stocks continued to perform well. BankAmerica rose { to
33&lsqb;; Citicorp gained &rsqb; to 25; and Beneficial rose 1{ to 54~.
   Greyhound Dial, which owns a large stake in Greyhound Lines, the
strike-bound bus company that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection late Monday, dropped | to 29.
   Philips Industries jumped 3\ to 17\. Tompkins PLC of Britain
agreed to acquire the company for $18.50 a share, or $550 million.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market declined $5.031 billion, or 0.14
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped 0.28 to 199.93.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index dropped 1.50 to 426.74, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index fell 0.76 to 366.64.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 1.00 to 464.61. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 363.83, down 0.57.

<TEXT>
   Six dissident members of the founding family of
Campbell Soup Co. disclosed that they have formed a voting trust to
further their aim of selling the food products company.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday,
the six revealed they controlled 17.4 percent of the Camden,
N.J.-based company's shares.
   The group _ composed of three nieces of Campbell's late chairman,
John T. Dorrance Jr., and their husbands _ said it continues ``to
believe that the best interests of the shareholders would be served
by sale of the company.''
   The dissident group added, however, that their position ``does
not reflect dissatisfaction with David Johnson,'' who became chief
executive officer of Campbell in January.
   In Camden, Johnson issued a statement saying: ``I'm gratified by
the expression of support from this group of shareholders for the
company's new strategic direction. We are confident that Campbell
Soup Co. will deliver the financial results needed to build maximum
long-term wealth for all of our shareholders.''
   Dorrance, whose great uncle founded the company, died last April.
   Three of Dorrance's children took control last year of his 31.3
percent stake in the company. They issued a statement last December
saying they intended to maintain their ownership in Campbell and
keep the company independent.

   Joblessness tripled in East Germany in just
six weeks and the government, worried about mass unrest, unveiled a
broad program Tuesday to blunt the shock of the shift to a free
market.
   East German factories will cut hours and reduce wages to try to
keep people on the payroll even though there is less work for them
to do, said Labor and Social Minister Regine Hildebrandt.
   A new employment administration has been created to oversee a
program for compensating workers for lost wages and retraining them
for new jobs, she said.
   East Germany is to officially shed four decades of socialism July
2 and merge its economy and social institutions with West Germany.
It will be the biggest and most difficult stage of full German
unification.
   The effects of unification already are being felt in the form of
rising prices and growing unemployment as East German enterprises,
many of them inefficient and overstaffed, face Western competition.
   About 100,000 people were officially unemployed at the end of
May, said Mrs. Hildebrandt. That represents only 1 percent of the
work force, but it is about three times the ated Mike Easley,
the Brunswick County district attorney in the runoff for the
Democratic nomination and will face GOP Sen. Jesse Helms.

   The Commerce Department has told U S West Inc. it
will oppose the company's proposal to supply high-speed
telecommunications transmission technology for a trans-Soviet fiber
optic project, U S West said Tuesday.
   Company spokesman Ed Mattix said the Commerce Department cited
national security reasons in opposing attempts by any country to
supply transmission technology with a capacity of 140 megabits a
second or greater to the Soviet Union.
   Mattix declined to say how much U S West stood to make on the
project other than to say ``it would be very profitable.'' He said
the company would appeal the decision.
   ``We're hopeful to address those security issues with Commerce
and hopefully change their mind about that'' in the next 30 to 45
days, he said.
   ``The technology we're talking about is not state of the art, it
is technology two to three generations behind what's used in the
United States today,'' he said.
   ``The standard today in the United States is 1.7 gigabits or 1.7
billion bits of information per second. We were proposing 565
megabits or 565 million bits of information per second,'' Mattix
said.
   A news release from U S West said the fiber-optic Line would meet
growing requirements for communications between the Asia-Pacific
region and Europe by providing international voice, facsimile and
data transmission. It also would provide long distance telephone
communications within the Soviet Union.
   Principals in the project include U S West, the Soviet Ministry
of Posts and Telecommunications, Kokusai Denshin Denway of Japan,
Societa Finanziaria Telefonica of Italy, British Telecom PLC, OTC of
Australia, Denmark's Great Nordic Telegraph Company and Telecom
Denmark, and the Deutsche Bundespost Telkom of West Germany.

<HEAD>Firm Reportedly To Propose Plan Calling for Full Repayment to
Creditors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. will present
creditors with a reorganization plan that will pay them 100 cents
for every dollar owed, a newspaper reported.
   The proposal is expected to be announced Wednesday afternoon at a
meeting between the creditors and Drexel's law firm, Weil, Gotshal &amp;
Manges, The New York Times said in an early edition of Wednesday's
paper.
   ``It will begin the process of formulating a reorganization plan
with all of Drexel's constituents,'' said Alan B. Miller, Drexel's
lead bankruptcy lawyer.
   The court-appointed creditors committee is expected to meet on
Thursday to respond to Drexel's plan, the newspaper said.
   Weil, Gotshal lawyers already have told some creditors that
Drexel would seek to repay them through a new company that would
hold Drexel's portfolio of junk bonds, bridge loans and other
securities, the paper said.
   A representative of one creditor said Drexel valued its holdings
at about $2 billion but can't sell most of the assets readily
because of their poor quality and the weak state of the junk bond
market, the Times said.
   As a result, the company will propose creating a new entity to
issue notes to creditors and pay down those notes as the bonds and
other investments are sold, the newspaper said.
   Creditors' representatives said a critical stumbling block to
Drexel's plans would be the guarantees the firm can make about the
value of its investments, the Times said.
   The reorganization proposal will cover all Drexel bankruptcy
filings, including last week's Chapter 11 filing of the company's
investment banking arm, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The holding company filed for Chapter 11 in February because of a
liquidity crisis brought on by its holdings of junk bonds and other
investments.
