   Less than a month away from elections, Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu finds himself with more critics than
supporters among the public and lukewarm backing in his own party.
   Kaifu, 59, took office in August after two predecessors had
resigned because of scandals and election losses by the previously
invincible Liberal Democratic Party. Opinion polls show disapproval
outweighing support, and anlysts say his situation is worse within
the party.
   The prime minister dissolved Parliament's powerful lower house
Wednesday to begin the campaign for the elections Feb. 18. With
Parliament disbanded, Kaifu will not be able to deliver a major
policy speech before the vote or make progress on the budget and
revising the unpopular sales tax.
   ``Inside the LDP, Kaifu is very, very weak,'' said Seizaburo
Sato, a professor at Tokyo University. ``He's not regarded by
fellow LDP members as the best candidate for prime minister.''
   His position gives Kaifu the final say on dissolving the lower
house and setting the election date, but other leaders in the party
apparently decided on Feb. 18.
   ``This demonstrates Kaifu is weak; he has weak initiative,''
Sato said.
   When Kaifu was chosen as party president and prime minister, he
was viewed as an eloquent, little-known reformer. Party veterans
saw the former education minister as an untarnished politician who
could help restore the image of the Liberal Democrats.
   So far, he has not been touched by problems that brought down
his predecessors, Sousuke Uno and Prime Ministers Noboru.
   Support ratings for Kaifu in public opinion polls have ranged
between 35 percent and 45 percent, well above the single-digit
ratings accorded Takeshita last spring.
   A poll released Tuesday by Asahi, a major national newspaper,
showed 37 percent of those surveyed supported Kaifu's government,
compared with 35 percent in December. Asahi said the slight
increase probably resulted from Kaifu's European tour Jan. 8-18.
   Disapproval of Kaifu also rose, however _ to 41 percent from 40
in December. The poll was a random survey of 3,000 people last
weekend, and Asahi did not give a margin of error.
   Poll results indicate the Liberal Democrats will have trouble
keeping a majority in the 512-seat lower house, where they have 295
seats. The Socialists, with 84 seats, hope to win at least 140 and
join with other opposition parties to deny a majority to the
Liberal Democrats, who have governed Japan since the party was
formed in 1955.
   The impression that Kaifu still is considered an interim leader
was bolstered by the reports that others chose the election date,
and the fact that former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe led a party
delegation to Moscow in mid-January, to some extent distracting
attention from Kaifu's European tour.
   Analyst Kenzo Uchida wrote in the Japan Times that efforts by
Kaifu and Abe improve the party image through diplomacy were
spoiled by the ``negative image of their personal ambitions and
rivalry.''
   Old-guard politicians, temporarily banished from the limelight
by the Recruit stock-dealing and bribery scandal, are expected to
make strong comebacks after the election.
   Abe, 65, and former Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, 69,
control major party factions and are strong contenders for party
leader whatever the election result.
   Although Kaifu could continue as prime minister if the Liberal
Democrats retain their majority in the lower house, analysts say
his mediocre poll ratings and weakness within the party make it
unlikely.
   He was a surprise choice as party leader after Uno resigned to
take responsibility for the July elections in which the Liberal
Democrats lost their majority in the upper house.
   Kaifu represents one of the weakest party factions and has
little political clout, but leaders of larger blocs were too
tainted by the scandal to seek the job.
   Five main factions vie for influence in the party and members
customarily vote along faction lines in elections for party
president. Kaifu's group was founded by the late Prime Minister
Takeo Miki, who was known as the ``Mr. Clean'' of Japanese politics
for his opposition to corruption.
   Keiichiro Nakamura, another analyst, said Kaifu was chosen,
``not because of his personal policies or qualifications, but
because of the power of factions.''

   The well-dressed dog needn't rely on
a bulky collar or unsightly tattoo anymore to identify his owner.
The chic pooch of today can wear a microchip, tucked neatly under
his fur.
   About 10,000 pets in the United States and Canada have been
injected with the Info-Pet identification system, said Dian Street,
the director of operations for the firm based in suburban Los
Angeles.
   The microchips carry an identification number readable by
hand-held scanners _ like the ones in supermarket checkout counters
_ provided free to animal shelters, Street said.
   The ID number is called in to Info-Pet, which then retrieves the
pet's ownership records. The process costs $40 for the chip
implantation and $11 a year to keep the records.
   In California, 23 animals with the chips have been reported
reunited with their owners.
   The tiny chips provide a more reliable means of helping find a
lost pet's home than collars, or tattoos that can fade, said one
veterinarian.
   ``This system is virtually foolproof,'' said Dr. Tom Carpenter
of the Newport Harbor Animal Hospital, which serves as the Newport
Beach Animal Shelter.

   Awaiting an abortion, Florica Poptean
sat calmly on a bed in Polizu hospital and recalled that five years
earlier she was brought bleeding and unconscious to the same
hospital after trying to end a pregnancy by herself.
   During Nicolae Ceausescu's rule, abortion was strictly limited
in Romania and illegal operations led to thousands of deaths and
injuries each year.
   Now at Polizu, the country's largest maternity hospital, doctors
are performing 80 to 100 abortions daily.
   Dr. Gabriel Bonceanu, who supervises the interns who do many of
the abortions, says 60 of the operations are carried out between 8
a.m. and noon.
   Mrs. Poptean was in a room with four other women who had just
had abortions, or were awaiting the surgery. All five women said
they simply asked to have an abortion and were given an appointment.
   ``We have the liberty now to make our own decisions on when we
have children,'' said Mrs. Poptean.
   The change came with the toppling of Ceausescu and the scrapping
of a law that prohibited abortion for women under 45 unless their
lives were in danger. The law was part of the dictator's effort to
increase Romania's population from 23 million to 30 million by the
end of the century.
   Mrs. Poptean said that at age 36, with a 13-year-old son, she
felt she was too old to cope with a newborn, especially with
conditions still uncertain in Romania.
   Five years before, she said, she was afraid to have another
child because of her family's disastrous economic state, and could
not afford an illegal abortion.
   ``I tried to induce it myself with a rubber tube,'' she said.
``I started hemorrhaging and wound up being taken here
unconscious.''
   Afterwards, she said, she was questioned by a panel that
demanded to know who had performed the abortion or if she had done
it herself. The panels decided whether women could have abortions
and were said to include police and prosecution officials.
   ``I told them I had an accident,'' she said. ``You had to have
the courage to resist them.''
   Dr. Bonceanu said that last year more than 4,000 women were
brought to Polizu hospital suffering from unsuccessful abortions,
either self-induced or performed by others. In his hospital alone,
he said, 17 women died and many others suffered permanent injuries.
   An unofficial figure puts the number of women who died from
failed abortions throughout the country at 800 to 1,000 annually,
Dr. Bonceanu said.
   One of Mrs. Poptean's roommates, 23-year-old Carmen Bragadiru,
said she would not have had the courage to have an illegal abortion.
   ``Without the change in the law, I would have had the baby,''
she said.
   Like most of the dozen women interviewed at Polizu, Mrs.
Bragadiru said she could not afford another child. She works at the
post office and lives with her car-painter husband and their
3-year-old son in two rooms.
   ``If they raise salaries, I'd have another child,'' said
Stefania Ratoiu, a 32-year-old mother of two who had just had an
abortion.
   Mrs. Ratoiu said she also had induced an abortion herself with
an earlier pregnancy: ``I did it because otherwise they would not
have let me in the hospital.''
   None of the women interviewed said they had been able to
practice birth control other than by the rhythm method. Part of
Ceausescu's policy to increase the population was to outlaw family
planning information and birth control pills and devices.
   Dr. Bonceanu said there was an urgent need for other countries
to provide birth control pills and devices and family planning
information.
   ``This is a big problem, because we in Romania do not have the
money for this,'' he said.
   Standing in a hallway as one woman after another was guided in
and out of two small operating rooms, Dr. Bonceanu said the
hospital was short of drugs and medical gear. It does not have the
modern equipment used to carry out suction abortions and depends on
the traditional curetage method.
   Nearby, a woman was washing rubber surgical gloves and drying
them on a radiator so they could be used again.

<HEAD>Military Budget To Increase This Year For First Time Since 1986</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China will spend more on defense this year, an
official newspaper said today, reversing a trend over recent years
to give the military low priority and allow its budget to lag
behind inflation.
   The China Daily, without giving figures, quoted State Planning
Commission officials as saying defense spending will rise from
1989, when the budget was officially $5.22 billion.
   It will be the first budget since the military crackdown on
pro-democracy protesters last June.
   The government has sought to reward the People's Liberation Army
for carrying out the widely unpopular move by giving it a more
visible government role and by launching a campaign to boost its
reputation.
   The China Daily said defense spending has stayed at about the
same level since 1986, while the national price index has gone up
by more than 40 percent.
   Defense spending last year was 11.9 percent of the national
budget, down from 1988 when the budget of $4.6 billion was 12.2
percent of the total.
   A Western military expert said China's military spending may be
far larger than reported because ``great chunks may be included in
other budgets.''
   The military was on the losing end of budgetary battles during
the 1980s as tensions with the Soviet Union eased and senior leader
Deng Xiaoping gave priority to spending for economic development.
   Deng reduced the size of the People's Liberation Army from 4
million to 3 million, and has ordered defense industries to switch
to producing civilian goods.
   The daily said 80 percent of defense industries are now turning
out civilian products _ worth almost $4.25 billion last year.
   China does not break down defense spending, and such items as
the major cost of settling and housing retired soldiers and
military procurement may be listed in other budgets.
   The Western military expert, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said a recent report that the government will cut arms production
by 45 percent this year, while possibly true, may not be that
significant.
   China still has many arms factories built in isolated mountain
regions of the Chinese interior during the 1960s when Mao Tse-tung
feared a Soviet invasion. They are producing little and could be
closed without serious effect on the industry, he said.
   ``There's an awful lot of fat to be cut,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The neo-Nazi movement is familiar fodder for
docudramas, so Lionel Chetwynd decided to try a different approach:
make a TV movie that explores the attraction of Nazism for ordinary
people.
   ``Why do good, ordinary people become Nazis? You won't find the
answer to that on the front page of newspapers,'' Chetwynd said.
``You can't make a docudrama about how decent people are seduced by
this dark shadow. This is a cautionary tale.''
   ``So Proudly We Hail,'' which CBS broadcasts tonight, tells
parallel stories of three young men and a college professor who
view the extremist group as the answer to their problems.
   ``In 1923, Adolf Hitler staged the beer hall putsch in Munich,''
Chetwynd said. ``He was sent to jail, where he wrote `Mein Kampf.'
He had only a few followers, yet within six years the Nazis were a
major force in Germany. If you can do that with just a broken-down
telephone system, what can be accomplished in this day of
computers, television and fax machines? Imagine what a
sophisticated, technically aware group could do in this country.''
   The two-hour movie stars David Soul as a charismatic white
supremacist who heads a group called the Aryan Resurgence Movement.
Edward Herrmann plays a professor who accepts Soul's offer to
publish his theory on cultural differences to avoid a threatened
loss of tenure if he doesn't publish a scholarly work.
   Chad Lowe, Billy Morrissette and Peter Dobson also star as three
young drifters recruited as skinheads by Raphael Sbarge.
   ``There aren't enough evil people to accomplish the purposes of
these leaders,'' said Chetwynd, who also served as the movie's
executive producer. ``They accomplish their goals by convincing
ordinary people that the cure for their problems is to get rid of
people who are not like them. They convince them that Jews,
`coloreds' and homosexuals are behind their troubles.
   ``This movie doesn't have a happy ending. It has what I think is
a realistic ending. The movement isn't destroyed. You can't kill a
dragon with one blow.
   ``This a story without the obvious victims. You tell it in a
context that separates them from their victims. The issues are not
clear cut. It may take viewers a while to see what these people are
up to. The neo-Nazis succeed by addressing issues that frighten
other politicians. Theirs is the only voice being heard.''
   Chetwynd said he's concerned that people accept the presentation
of issues on television as truth.
   ``We say up front that we made this story up,'' he said. ``It's
just one view of what extremism is in this country. We didn't
research it to death. It doesn't stand for all extremism in
America.''
   Chetwynd was born in England and raised in Canada. When just 16,
he lied about his age and joined the Black Watch, the Royal
Highland Regiment of Canada. He later studied at Sir George
Williams University and McGill University Law School in Canada.
   His skill as a champion debater took him to England, where he
was invited to complete law studies at Oxford's Trinity College. He
began writing stage plays while working for the distribution arm of
Columbia Pictures in London.
   Chetwynd usually is associated with movies that have a point of
view. In 1988, he wrote ``To Heal a Nation,'' the story behind the
Vietnam War Memorial in Washington. Other movies include ``Evil in
Clear River,'' ``Children in the Crossfire'' and ``Miracle on
Ice.'' His feature films are ``The Apprenticeship of Duddy
Kravitz'' and ``Hanoi Hilton.''
   He also is developing movies on what happens when cocaine and
crack infect a small, middle-class town and on the effect of
television on college sports, along with a theatrical film for
Whoopi Goldberg called ``Mommy Never Told Me.''
   Television gives him the latitude to deal with controversial
issues, Chetwynd said.
   ``It begins with the idea that television is an extraordinary
medium, and if by happenstance and good fortune I'm able to do
quality work, that's a great gift,'' he said. ``I can't say I
wouldn't want to do something profitable, like a hit series, but
I'm quite happy.''

<HEAD>Labor Minister Says Firings Could Result From Wave Of Strikes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The labor minister called this month's
unprecedented wave of strikes ``an expression of democracy'' but
condemned the use of violence by strikers and said some could be
fired.
   Strikes for higher wages have disrupted major hospitals, ports,
transport services and factories across the southern African
country. Authorities say six hospital patients in the port city of
Beira died as a result of a walkout by nurses seeking to double
their pay.
   Labor Minister Aguiar Mazula, at a news conference Monday, said
the government accepted the right of workers to strike but would
insist that proper procedures be followed.
   In terms of a decree issued Jan. 10, a strike is legal only if
approved by a trade union committee or a mass meeting of workers,
and if 72 hours advance notice is given to the employer and the
government.
   Many of the strikers have not taken these steps, and Mazula said
they could face dismissal.
   Mazula said there was no justification for strike-related
sabotage, ``much less the deaths of innocent people.''
   He said most of the strikers' demands were reasonable, but that
many employers _ including the government _ could not afford to
meet them.
   Referring to the nurses' demand for a 100 percent pay raise,
Mazula said: ``The state cannot grant such claims, and I think the
strike leaders know perfectly well the condition of the country.
   ``We are living on donated food and donated medicine. Our level
of productivity is extremely low,'' he said.
   Since 1977, two years after independence from Portugal,
Mozambique has been wracked by a hit-and-run insurgency waged by
rebels of the Mozambique National Resistance.
   The leftist government _ which last year dropped
Marxism-Leninism as its official ideology _ has tried to counter
the economic devastation through a major reform program that has
included several currency devaluations and a lessening of state
control over production.

<TEXT>
   The golden arches are up and a crew of 630 is
standing by, ready to begin serving the first Moscow Big Macs _
which must taste the same as those bought at any other McDonald's
in the world.
   Quality control is the responsibility of Craig Sopkowicz of
Milwaukee, who is putting the finishing touches on a training
program for the Soviets hired to man the grills, cola dispensers
and cash registers at the glistening new restaurant on Pushkin
Square just blocks from Red Square.
   Moscow-McDonald's, a joint venture set up by McDonald's
Restaurants of Canada, Ltd., and the Food Service Administration of
the Moscow City Council, began its search for staff in November.
   The response to an ad in Moscow's youth newspaper was
overwhelming, with 30,000 applications for the available jobs.
   ``We had some applications from people who lived two days travel
time away from Moscow,'' Sopkowicz said. ``They really wouldn't
have minded traveling two days to work here.''
   In the end, Sopkowicz and other McDonald's executives personally
interviewed 4,100 applicants before finally deciding on the final
630 for the restaurant.
   ``We looked for applicants who lived close to the restaurant
among other things,'' Sopkowicz said. ``Most of those we hired are
university students. Several of them speak English and about 30
percent have a second language other than Russian,'' he said.
   The next step for Sopkowicz and his crew was the task of
training the young Soviets to provide the kind of fast service
required of all McDonald's establishments.
   ``First, we used video training tapes, dubbed into Russian.
Then, all of our training manuals were translated into Russian,
which made it easy for us because we worked alongside of them with
the same manuals in English,'' he said.
   Language for the Soviet crew will not be a problem: This
restaurant is for the Soviet people, and not restricted to
foreigners and tourists with hard currency like most of the other
foreign-operated restaurants in Moscow.
   Rubles will be the currency for purchasing Big Macs, although
when 19 other planned McDonald's restaurants open over the next
five years, about half will be restricted to hard currency
customers.
   As the training neared its end, and uniforms were being issued
to the new employees, the work pace of Sopkowicz and other
executives was frantic.
   ``Look at my feet,'' he said in an interview on a snowy morning.
``I have to wear running shoes to keep up.''
   Sopkowicz has not had time to miss Milwaukee, not even the
weather. ``I don't really notice any difference. Milwaukee can be
20 degrees below, the same as it is here. There, it also can snow
every day for a month, a lot like here,'' he said.
   With the grand opening scheduled for Jan. 31, the restaurant is
getting the final distinctive McDonald's touches.
   Menus, printed in Russian, offer fewer items than the typical
U.S. McDonald's fare. The basic menu includes: Big Mac,
Filet-O-Fish, Double Cheeseburger, Double Hamburger, Cheeseburger,
Milk Cocktail (milkshake), soft drinks, french fries and ice cream
sundaes.
   Prices, which have not been officially posted, will be roughly
equivalent to those in Western McDonald's, which will make the the
Big Mac a reletively expensive meal for a Russian, who earns about
one fifth the average Western salary.
   But Sopkowicz and other McDonald's executives are expecting
hordes of customers and are geared up to serve 17,000 daily.
   In the final days of training, the new staff is being drilled on
the fact that a McDonald's is a McDonald's no matter where it is.
   ``We are explaining that they must be polite, friendly and say
things like `have a good day' and `come back soon,''' phrases
seldom heard in Soviet restaurants and shops.
   But, Sopkowicz is optimistic. ``All the people we hired, they
all had a sparkle in their eye. They still have it,`` he said. ``We
had 4,100 people to choose from. We had the pick of the crop, easy
to train and fully adaptable to our equipment, procedure and
policy.''

   The Vietnam drama ``Born on the Fourth of
July'' capped a triumphant weekend in which it collected four
Golden Globe awards by dominating national box office receipts.
   Starring Tom Cruise as a soldier whose patriotic attitudes are
shattered by his experience in Vietnam and afterward, ``Born on the
Fourth'' grossed $6.2 million at the nation's theaters,
Entertainment Data Inc. said Monday.
   The film won Golden Globe trophies on Saturday night for best
dramatic movie, best dramatic actor for Cruise, best director for
Oliver Stone and best screenplay for Stone and Ron Kovic, on whose
life the story is based.
   Next on the box office charts was the action-adventure ``Tango &amp;
Cash,'' with ticket sales of $4.3 million. The dark divorce comedy
``The War of the Roses'' came in third with $4.2 million.
   ``Internal Affairs,'' pairing Richard Gere and Andy Garcia as
police officers on opposite sides of the law, finished fourth with
a gate of $4 million. In fifth, opening to weak business with $3.7
million, was the fright film ``Tremors.''
   ``Always,'' the romantic remake from director Steven Spielberg,
grossed $3.5 million for sixth place. In seventh was the ensemble
drama ``Steel Magnolias'' with $2.9 million.
   The animated hit ``The Little Mermaid'' netted $2.8 million
while ``Driving Miss Daisy'' was ninth with $2.6 million. ``Driving
Miss Daisy,'' the story of a Southern widow and her chauffeur, won
Golden Globes for best comic or musical motion picture. Morgan
Freeman and Jessica Tandy won best comic or musical actor and
actress, respectively.
   Rounding out the top 10 was ``Back to the Future Part II'' with
a gate of $2.4 million.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Monday as
tallied by Entertainment Data, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts

   The antics of a lone moose who has
been trying to court the attentions of dairy cows may be amusing to
onlookers, but a farmer has had enough of the confused creature.
   During the weeks he has been circulating around the area of
western Massachusetts, the moose has become a minor celebrity,
drawing regular visitors to the farm that Frank Montague runs for
his son, Peter.
   ``They're all over the place,'' he said of the onlookers. ``The
first day _ by that afternoon _ there were a half dozen cars. And
they're not happy just to look from the road. There's a road
besides the barn on my property and they go all the way down.''
   Three years ago more than 75,000 people visited a Shrewsbury,
Vt., farm where a 700-pound moose spent 76 days wooing a Hereford
cow named Jessica. A song called ``Lovesick Moose'' was written
about the two.
   Steven Winkler, Frank Montague's nephew, said the family has
asked the state Department of Fisheries and Wildlife to move the
moose, which has been hanging around the farm since Jan. 10.
   ``He's gotten to be a pain in the neck. He hops over the fence
where the cows feed, but for some reason he just can't see the
fence down in the back near the swamp,'' Winkler said.
   State wildlife biologist James Cardoza said his office has
monitored the moose's whereabouts since it was first sighted in the
area in October.
   If the moose doesn't move on soon, ``what we'll try to do is
herd him to a larger area of forest where he is less likely to get
in trouble,'' Cardoza said.

<HEAD>Union Officials Say Port Strike Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A three-day-old strike at the Port of
Baltimore ended Monday night and dockworkers were expected back on
the job Tuesday, union officials said.
   ``We're definitely back to work,'' said Tim Nickel, vice
president of Local 953 of the International Longshoremen's
Association. ``I've been calling people and telling them to report
to work at 8 a.m. tomorrow.''
   The tentative proposal was reached Monday in New York between
the longshoremen and negotiators for the Steamship Trade
Association. Neither side would release details, but said the
agreement is similar to one that was to have been voted on last
Friday.
   The agreement still calls for reduction in the number of jobs
held by members of Local 953. But the new proposal allows the union
the jurisdiction to get the jobs back should the work return to the
port.
   ``I'm certainly disappointed in the fact that the cuts are still
there ... but nonetheless we have a foundation established over
what 953's jurisdiction is and we have to live with it,'' said
Richard Hughes, president of 953.
   Gov. William Donald Schaefer's press secretary Paul Schurick
said a vote on the proposal was scheduled for Wednesday.
   Schurick said the governor was optimisic and pleased with the
news and said the contract is a step in the right direction toward
restoring Baltimore's competitiveness in shipping.

   In a bid to attract more blacks and Asians to join the force and
better reflect the capital's population, the Metropolitan police
said Monday they have dropped their height requirements.
   Assistant Commissioner Wyn Jones, who announced the change, said
the minimum 5-foot-8 for men and 5-foot-4 for women represented
above-average heights for people from the Bangladeshi, Chinese and
Vietnamese communities.
   London has 440 minority police officers, or 1.5 percent of the

   About 60 percent of the city's 30,000-strong force lives outside

<HEAD>Cavazos' Performance Draws Mixed Reviews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos is still
drawing mixed reviews from the education establishment 16 months
into his job, but his critics are showing signs of softening.
   ``We grade him somewhere in the `C' range. We changed it from a
`C-minus' because of his announcement'' of a report on the reading
and writing performance of American schoolchildren, said Jeanne
Allen, education policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, one of
his harshest critics.
   Cavazos, the former president of Texas Tech University who
became the first Hispanic Cabinet official in the waning days of
President Reagan's administration, has drawn fire in President
Bush's administration.
   Opponents call Cavazos a government outsider whose low-key
management style doesn't provide the vocal advocacy needed for
education.
   ``I don't think he's hurt by it. It comes with the turf,'' said
Lon Anderson, a Cavazos aide. ``The secretary tells us, `I've had a
lot of praise too with my style. My style has been very successful
for me. It has carried me a long way. I'm a Cabinet member.'''
   ``He'll be around for a while,'' said Anderson.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater recently dismissed
reports that Cavazos might be on his way out, telling reporters,
``He has the job as long as he wants it. Secretary Cavazos has done
an outstanding job.''
   At the department, Cavazos has been credited with restoring a
civil tone after the confrontational tactics that marked the tenure
of his predecessor, William Bennett, now the national anti-drug
czar.
   From the first, Cavazos reached out to the education
establishment that Bennett repeatedly attacked. He says he wants to
work with teachers and others to solve the problems of the nation's
schools. Where Bennett called press conferences, Cavazos calls
private meetings, away from the cameras and eyes of reporters.
   Some Education Department officials say Cavazos' approach is
both a blessing and a curse. Although Bennett was publicly
badmouthed for his combative style, he grabbed attention and made
education a subject of national discussion.
   ``Bennett used the office as a bully pulpit,'' said Ms. Allen.
``Cavazos should use it in the same way.''
   She said Cavazos' National Assessment of Educational Progress
last year was an example of the effort that should be made more
often to ``make sure that the message is getting to the American
people.''
   In speeches to education groups all over the country, Cavazos
repeatedly has focused on his personal concerns: reducing high
school dropout rates, expanding and improving early childhood
education, and broadening opportunities for minorities, the
disabled and the disadvantaged.
   Cavazos dislikes comparisons to Bennett, said department
officials. Instead, he sees similarities with the low-key Terrel H.
Bell, President Reagan's education secretary.
   ``I appreciate that,'' Bell said in an interview. ``I just think
each of us has to stand on our own. I think he's doing a fine job
under the circumstances.''
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education
and Labor Committee, isn't happy with Cavazos and has suggested the
committee's ranking Republican, William Goodling of Pennsylvania,
is one of at least four others who could replace Cavazos.
   But Goodling believes that Cavazos has learned how to work
inside the government. ``I view his performance as someone who has
grown dramatically in the job. He had no political experience
before coming to Washington, and positively no experience within
the Beltway, which means you have about 100 strikes against you.''
   ``He's not flamboyant, doesn't seek publicity,'' said Goodling.
``The last guy (Bennett) did but didn't do anything for education.
I think it's time to just let (Cavazos) alone and see if he can do
the job. Give him the opportunity to do the job.''
   Outside Washington, Cavazos receives more positive assessments.
   ``One of the things (Cavazos) has been doing very quietly ... is
bringing on good people,'' said Leonard Britton, superintendent of
Los Angeles Public Schools. ``He definitely knows where he wants to
go in that regard.
   ``Cavazos is bringing back credibility, I think,'' he said.
   He also gets high marks from some educators for emphasizing
minority education.
   Rita Esquival, director of the Office of Bilingual Education and
Minority Languages Affairs, said, ``the secretary of education has
done more for language minority children than any other secretary.
He comes from a background where he knows firsthand that it's
important and he has allowed us to blossom and flourish.''
   Robert Bailey, superintendent of the Native American school
district of Busby in Montana, added, ``I feel positive about his
focus on Native Americans and bilingual education. Bennett had a
different philosophy. He felt that minority languages should not be
supported.''

<HEAD>Justices Say White's Rights Not Violated by All-White Jury</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court says the right to be tried
by an impartial jury does not entitle a white defendant to have
blacks serve as jurors deciding the accused's fate.
   But the justices, sharply divided over the issue, indicated that
in some future case they might rule that excluding blacks as jurors
does discriminate unlawfully against white defendants.
   Those seemingly contradictory conclusions were spelled out
Monday in the case of Daniel Holland, a Chicago-area white man
sentenced to 85 years in prison for rape, kidnapping and armed
robbery.
   He was convicted by an all-white jury after prosecutors barred
the only two blacks among more than 30 prospective jurors from
serving on the panel.
   In other action, the court:
   _Sent a new signal it will permit widespread, random drug
testing for government workers even when public safety is not at
stake. The justices, without comment, refused to interfere with
random drug tests for some Justice Department employees and
civilian Army drug and alcohol counselors.
   _Ruled, 6-3, that lawyers in the nation's capital violated
antitrust law when they went ``on strike'' to demand higher pay
from the city for representing penniless criminal defendants.
   _Agreed to use a North Carolina case to decide whether nuclear
industry ``whistleblowers'' who say they were disciplined for
complaining about lax safety may sue under state personal injury
laws.
   _Said it will decide in a decade-long Haitian refugee case when
the government must pay legal fees to people who sue it
successfully. The court will hear a Bush administration appeal
aimed at limiting the fees.
   _Voted to study a former high school wrestling coach's
15-year-old libel lawsuit against an Ohio newspaper. At issue is
how courts are to distinguish between ``fact'' and ``opinion'' in
libel cases.
   In the Holland case, the court voted, 5-4, that his Sixth
Amendment right to be tried by a jury representing a fair
cross-section of the community was not violated.
   Left unanswered is whether Holland's, or any other white
defendant's, 14th Amendment right is abridged when prospective
jurors are excluded because they are black. The 14th Amendment
guarantees equal protection under the law, broadly prohibiting
racial bias.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who voted with the majority Monday,
said he might switch his vote if the issue is 14th Amendment
protections.
   ``I find it essential to make clear that if (Holland's) claim
here were based on the 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause, it
would have merit,'' he said.
   Holland had not asked the high court to consider the 14th
Amendment issue in his case.
   The justices in 1986 ruled that when prosecutors disqualify
potential jurors based on their race it violates the 14th
Amendment's ban on discrimination. But that case, involving a black
defendant and black jurors, applied only to instances in which the
defendant and the jurors are the same race.
   The court never has said whether unlawful racial discrimination
in jury selection occurs when the accused is of a different race
than the excluded jurors.
   The 1986 ruling dramatically curtailed the traditionally broad
power of prosecutors to eliminate prospective jurors from trials by
using peremptory, or automatic, challenges.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court in Holland's
appeal, said, ``Race as such has nothing to do with the legal issue
in this case.''
   Holland's ``Sixth Amendment claim would be just as strong if the
object of the exclusion had been, not blacks, but postmen, or
lawyers, or clergymen, or any number of other identifiable
groups,'' he said.
   The Sixth Amendment ``no more forbids the prosecutor to strike
jurors on the basis of race than it forbids him to strike them on
the basis of innumerable other generalized characteristics,'' he
said.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, in a dissenting opinion, said, ``The
majority today insulates an especially invidious form of racial
discrimination in the selection of juries. The elimination of
racial discrimination in our system of criminal justice is not a
constitutional goal that should lightly be set aside.''
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and Harry A.
Blackmun.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in a separate dissent, said, ``A jury
that is the product of such a racially discriminatory selection
process cannot possibly be an impartial jury within the meaning of
the Sixth Amendment.``
   Joining Scalia were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Byron R. White and Kennedy.

<HEAD>Nicaraguan Rebels Promised More US Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are assuring the Nicaraguan
Contras they can count on additional U.S. humanitarian assistance
regardless of the outcome of next month's national elections in
that country.
   A $50 million aid program is due to expire just days after the
Feb. 25 elections, but legislative ground rules allow aid
deliveries to continue through March. The upcoming expiration of
the program has produced speculation that aid to the Contras may
finally end after almost 10 years.
   If the opposition coalition led by presidential candidate
Violeta Chamorro wins the election, it is widely expected the
rebels will return peacefully to Nicaragua from their base camps in
Honduras.
   In that event, renewed U.S. aid would be designed to help the
reintegration process, said the U.S. officials, asking not to be
identified.
   But, according to the officials, if President Daniel Ortega and
his Sandinista Front win _ either through a fair process or through
fraud _ the Contras are expected to continue on as a fighting
force. Many are said to be committed to resuming the armed struggle
against the Sandinista Army in the event Chamorro loses, even if
the process is honest.
   Whether the Contras are able to pose a credible military threat
is another question. They have received no U.S. military aid for
almost two years and none from any other source, so far as is known.
   At present, the U.S. program of providing food, clothing,
shelter and medical services is reaching just less than 10,000
Contras based at camps in southern Honduras and about 50,000 family
members living there.
   The Contra leaders have been told there is a ``political
consensus'' in the United States within the administration and the
Congress that the basic needs of Contras must continue to be met
even after the current aid allocation runs out, an official said.
   The form of any future aid package would be the subject of
discussions between the administration and the Congress over the
next two months.
   Members of Congress have had little to say on the issue lately
because they have been in recess for more than a month. But it is
expected Democrats will generally insist any new aid program be
linked to a process of reintegrating the rebels back into
Nicaraguan society. The administration, on the other hand, likely
will favor providing aid with few strings.
   The administration has expressed strong doubts about Sandinista
intentions regarding free and fair elections, citing what it claims
have been repeated instances of violence and intimidation against
opposition candidates.
   The Sandinistas argue the incidents have been isolated and
exaggerated by the administration.
   The nature of the Contra presence in Honduras has changed
considerably in recent months. As many as 3,000 Contras have
abandoned the main Honduran base location at Yamales and headed
eastward through extraordinarily dense foliage to an area less
exposed to potential Sandinista attacks.
   The forces deployed in that forbidding region are being
sustained by U.S.-sponsored airdrops of food and other supplies.
   These rebels are worried not only about the Sandinista military
but also about United Nations and Organization of American States
officials participating in a commission set up to demobilize the
Contras.
   The five Central American presidents created the commission in
August. Within weeks many rebels began fleeing eastward while
others _ up to 2,500 _ redeployed inside Nicaragua.
   As officials described it, these Contras want to give up the
struggle according to their own timetable and not that of an
international commission. They are not convinced it is safe as yet
to return to Nicaragua despite Sandinista assurances that the
current electoral process is genuinely democratic.

   Senate leaders predict a lengthy and ``at
times contentious'' floor battle as Congress works on opposing
plans to clean up the nation's dirty and unhealthy air.
   A bill to tighten air pollution controls was being sent this
afternoon to the Senate floor, where critics are expected to offer
amendments aimed at lowering the cost to industry and easing the
impact on automakers.
   ``This debate has been a long time in coming,'' Senate Majority
Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, told reporters Monday,
predicting ``long, formidable ... at times contentious debate.''
   A similar, although less stringent, clean air bill has yet to
clear a House committee as congressmen watch the issue's progress
in the Senate.
   With more than 100 million people breathing air the government
considers unhealthy and growing concern over the destruction of
streams and lakes by acid rain, there is little disagreement over
the need for tougher federal air pollution controls.
   But there is sharp dissent between Senate Democrats and
President Bush on how much of a burden industry should be asked to
assume.
   Last week Bush called the Senate bill too expensive, saying it
would cost twice as much as the administration's clean air proposal
_ which is similar to the House bill _ but would not provide
significantly cleaner air. Bush said he would only sign a bill that
``balances environmental and economic'' considerations.
   Mitchell and key sponsors of the Senate bill on Monday disputed
Bush's cost figures and maintained the administration plan does not
provide enough protection from urban air pollution and the health
effects of toxic industrial releases.
   The Bush proposal is ``much weaker and doesn't do the job,''
declared Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the Environment and
Public Works subcommittee that crafted the Senate legislation.
   Bush estimated the cost of his plan at $19 billion a year and
said the Senate bill would cost $40 billion a year. Most of the
increased cost is attributed to tighter standards after the turn of
the century for automobile emissions and toxic industrial releases.
   Mitchell said although the Senate plan might be ``slightly more
expensive,'' he disputed the White House's estimate. ``A cheaper
solution is often not the best solution,'' he told reporters.
   Supporters of the Senate bill called it ``a health bill'' and
suggested its costs are dwarfed by the additional health costs the
nation will face if automobile and industrial pollution is not
reduced over the next decade.
   Fran DuMelle of the American Lung Association said the annual
health costs associated with air pollution five years ago were
estimated at $15 billion to $40 billion. Today, the $40 billion
figure ``has become a middle range'' and the health toll continues
to rise, she said.
   All three proposals call for a 10 million ton reduction of acid
rain pollutants, primarily by utilities in the Midwest where plants
rely heavily on high-sulfur coal.
   A major battle is expected to involve who will pay for expensive
pollution controls on the dirtiest plants. Senators from many
Midwest states, where the plants are located, have argued in favor
of a nationwide ``cost sharing'' plan. But the White House and
senators from other states oppose any such distribution of costs.
   The Senate bill also would impose stringent automobile tailpipe
emission controls beginning in the year 2003. The administration
says that plan would only marginally improve air quality but be
costly to the auto industry.
   Supporters say the administration cost estimates are exaggerated
and that tougher standards are needed to push manufacturers into
developing new pollution control technology.

   Here are the major provisions of clean air
legislation being considered by Congress to significantly curb air
pollution by the turn of the century.
   ACID RAIN&equals;
   The legislation would significantly reduce sulfur dioxide
emissions from coal-burning electric power plants, at an estimated
cost of $10 million, by the year 2000, when emissions would be
capped. Some 107 plants, mostly in the Midwest, would face the most
severe controls. The legislation would also require plants to
reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. Utilities would be allowed to
trade and sell pollution credits to reduce costs incurred at the
worst-polluting plants.
   SMOG&equals;
   The legislation provides for tighter automobile tailpipe
emission controls similar to California standards. The Senate bill
also proposes a second phase of emission curbs aiming at a further
50 percent reduction in such pollution by the year 2003. The
legislation also provides for controls on pollution from a variety
of commercial sources, including gas stations, painting facilities
and dry cleaners. Urban areas would have to meet federal air
quality and health standards in 5 to 15 years depending on the
severity of the problem. Los Angeles would have 20 years.
   TOXIC CHEMICALS&equals;
   The legislation would require that industry install ``maximum
achievable control technology'' to reduce the release of more than
200 toxic chemicals from industrial sources. The Environmental
Protection Agency would be allowed to impose additional measures if
it determines a continual health risk existed from toxic releases.
The Senate version would also require Stage II ``health-based''
standards that direct industry to take additional steps to limit
``residual'' cancer risks to make them no greater than the risk of
one cancer for 10,000 exposures.
   OTHER MEASURES&equals;
   The legislation would require for the first time that industry
obtain federal pollution permits; would toughen enforcement and
penalties for pollution violators; would require businesses and
local governments to promote mass transit, car pools and other
measures to reduce automobile travel in the worst pollution areas,
and would, in the Senate version, call for fleet-wide automobile
mileage of 40 miles-per-gallon by the year 2000 by requiring cars
to meet new carbon dioxide standards.

<HEAD>Milk Prices Slow Down as Production Increases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Department dairy analysts say milk
production is headed up again after stalling in 1989 and that
prices are going to cool down.
   One effect will be felt at supermarkets where consumer prices of
milk and other dairy products will rise again this year but not at
the hectic pace of 1989, says Ralph Parlett of the department's
Economic Research Service.
   Overall, he said, retail prices of dairy products could rise by
as much as 3 percent, compared with an average gain of 6.6 percent
in 1989.
   A few weeks ago, Parlett figured dairy product prices might go
increase 1 percent to 2 percent this year. But now, he said Monday
in an interview, the increase could be more volatile, ranging from
zero to 3 percent.
   Consumer food prices generally are expected to rise 3 percent to
5 percent in 1990, a forecast announced by USDA last fall. The 1989
average was up almost 6 percent, the sharpest gain since 1981.
   Parlett said he is sticking by the 3 percent to 5 percent
forecast, at least for now.
   In a report by the USDA agency, economists say dairy markets
``are adjusting after the record prices and chaotic conditions of
last autumn.''
   The report said dairy prices at the farm and wholesale will drop
in the first half of 1990 because of cutbacks in non-fat dry milk
exports, likely increases in milk production, and consumer reaction
to higher prices.
   Another factor will be seasonal increases in milk output, the
``flush'' season of spring when production is at a peak. By then,
the report said, most wholesale prices are likely to be below a
year earlier.
   For all of 1990, the report said milk production will probably
rise 1 percent to 3 percent from last year's 145.3 billion pounds,
which was down fractionally from 1988.
   The analysis said government purchases of butter, cheese and
non-fat dry milk under the federal price support program ``will be
sizable in 1990, although the milk-equivalent total may not reach''
last year's nine billion pounds.
   Although dairy producers could be encouraged by recent high
prices and the improvement in the feed situation, expanded milk
output ``may be slowed by continued caution about new investment,''
the report said.

   Critics of an Agriculture Department plan to
streamline cattle slaughter inspection systems say the program is
faulty and put contaminated meat into the consumer market.
   In remarks prepared for a hearing today by the National Academy
of Sciences, former USDA official Carol Tucker Foreman,
representing a group of consumer and labor organizations, said the
department's ``streamlined inspection system,'' or SIS, is ``rife
with problems'' and should be reconsidered.
   Foreman was assistant secretary for food and consumer services
from 1977 to 1981 and supported the modernization of federal meat
and poultry inspection.
   But the SIS program, which is being tested in some pilot meat
plants, ``would add to the already serious problems affecting the
system and will reduce public health and safety protection,'' she
said.
   The streamlining, which was announced on Nov. 30, 1988, would
enable some selected cattle slaughter plants assume some of the
duties now performed by federal inspectors. One effect of the plan
would be a speedup in the line speed, thus boosting productivity.
   Foreman and others contend the SIS plan eliminates current
safeguards without installing a more effective science-based
program to detect diseased and other contaminated beef carcasses.
   ``Instead, it would create a system that relies on the good
faith of corporate records to protect public health,'' she said.
``This is highly questionable when these same companies have
received proposed fines from the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration in the range of $1 million each for falsifying their
records on occupational safety.''
   Tom Devine of the Government Accountability Project, a private
non-profit organization in support of government and corporate
whistle blowers, said in prepared remarks that the SIS, which he
noted has been in operation for poultry since 1983, would
``facilitate unrestricted production line speeds'' by substituting
systematic federal inspection with a company's own quality control.
   ``The plan's major goal is higher industry profits'' Devine
said. ``USDA predicts cattle slaughter productivity will increase
40 percent through faster line speeds and fewer condemned
carcasses.''
   Susan Turner-Lewis of the academy's staff said the hearing was
the opening round of a major study of the USDA plan and that it
might require most of this year to complete. The USDA awarded a
$164,000 contract to the academy last October for the export study.

   A report by Japan's International Agricultural
Council says foreigners think Japanese food is healthful, light and
esthetically pleasing.
   The agency said a survey of 121 foreigners living in Japan
showed Japanese food is ``steadily making inroads into the cuisines
of other nations.''
   ``One possible reason for this is that because of its low fat
content, Japanese cuisine is sean as healthy,'' the report said.
``Foreigners in their 20s and 30s from 18 countries were
interviewed for the survey.''
   Sushi was rated as the favorite Japanese food by the foreigners,
followed by tempura, or deep-fried fish and vegetables, and
sashimi, or thinly sliced raw fish served with soy sauce and
horseradish.

   Federal agents searched a man's
warehouse, salvage business and home Monday in the investigation of
mail bomb slayings of a judge in Birmingham and a civil rights
lawyer in Georgia.
   FBI Special Agent Chuck Archer of Mobile said the owner of the
property, Wayne O'Ferrell of nearby New Brockton, was questioned
and released.
   ``At no time today was anybody taken into custody,'' said Archer.
   The FBI agent, speaking at a brief evening news conference, said
agents were looking for evidence in the pre-Christmas package bomb
killings that put civil rights groups and the federal judiciary on
alert.
   O'Ferrell was involved in a case heard by federal appeals Judge
Robert Vance, who was killed when a package bomb sent through the
mail exploded at his Mountain Brook home near Birmingham last month.
   O'Ferrell had sued his former employer, Gulf Life Insurance Co.
of Jacksonville, Fla., over his firing, the appeals decision said.
   He disputed Gulf Life's claim that he was fired because he held
licenses with other insurance companies and he charged that Gulf
Life had failed to pay him renewal commissions due to him after he
was fired.
   But a federal judge in Alabama dismissed his lawsuit on June 17,
1988, and on April 17, Vance and two other 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals judges upheld the lower court ruling in a one-page
unsigned decision.
   Archer said agents probably would spend most of the night
searching the salvage store. But the search was called off about 10
p.m. and three police officers sealed off the area.
   ``To the best of my knowledge, these are the first searches in
the investigation,'' he said.
   He would not say what brought the investigation to the salvage
shop of O'Ferrell, a man in his 50s described by a neighbor as a
Bible-reading former Baptist preacher who once sold insurance and
took up the junk business about three years ago.
   Package bombs sent through the mail exploded and killed Vance at
his Mountain Brook home near Birmingham on Dec. 16 and a black
lawyer, Robert Robinson of Savannah, on Dec. 18. Other mailed bombs
were found and defused at the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta, the court Vance served, and the NAACP office in
Jacksonville, Fla.
   The FBI has said one or more white racists appear behind the
mail bomb attacks.
   O'Ferrell's suit originally was filed in state court.
   ``The man sued Gulf Life for benefits he thought he was due
under his employment contract and he wasn't entitled to any
benefits. It's that simple,'' Charles D. Stewart, an attorney for
the insurance company, told The New York Times.
   Marvin Hanigan, vice president of administration for Gulf Life,
was contacted at his Jacksonville, Fla., home late Monday and
refused to comment on whether the FBI had contacted the company or
whether O'Ferrell had been employed by the firm.
   FBI agents with bomb-sniffing dogs, along with police and a bomb
squad from Fort Rucker Army base, searched O'Ferrell's old salvage
business and new warehouse in Enterprise along with his New
Brockton home.
   Tina Sommerville, who lives across the street from the
warehouse, said the FBI questioned her about O'Ferrell, who has a
wife and two daughters.
   ``They are just average people,'' Mrs. Sommerville said of the
O'Ferrells. ``That's what makes this so strange.''
   ``He was always reading the Bible,'' she said.
   Another neighbor, Jackie Loley, who runs a carpet business, said
O'Ferrell has had a varied career including a time as a Baptist
preacher. ``He talked quite a bit about Christianity,'' said Loley.
   John Cauley, O'Ferrell's son-in-law, said late Monday family
members had not seen or heard from him since Monday morning.
   ``My wife is worried sick. She is very upset,'' Cauley told
reporters from the porch of the family's small, wood-frame house.
   Cauley said he, his wife, Tammy, and O'Ferrell's other daughter,
Danielle, were questioned by FBI agents. The agents asked them
about an old typewriter, but did not indicate why they were
interested in it, Cauley said.
   ``They asked a lot of questions. They didn't give a lot of
information,'' he said.
   Cauley lives with his wife at O'Ferrell's home. Cauley's wife
would not speak to reporters.
   Law officers kept the warehouse under guard Monday night. Mrs.
Sommerville said O'Ferrell earlier accompanied officers to the
warehouse, a one-story, shiny tin structure about 100 feet lon and
50 feet wide in a string of several warehouses. The business name
is spelled out on a flashing portable sign: ``New And Old Surplus
Salvage Store.''
   Mrs. Sommerville said O'Ferrell moved his junk store business to
the warehouse from a salvage shop downtown about a year ago.
   Mrs. Sommerville said the FBI ``asked me had I ever noticed any
strange activity (at the warehouse), or if I had ever noticed any
unusual number of cars over there, or unusual number of people over
there, or if he had ever shown a violent temper. I said, No, I had
never seen any of that.''

<HEAD>Hawkins: Equalize Education Spending Between States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most states spend widely different sums to
educate children in different areas within their borders, with
Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Texas and Vermont showing
especially sharp disparities, a congressional study shows.
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education
and Labor Committee, released the Congressional Research Study on
Monday to support legislation he planned to introduce today that he
says would give more children a better chance at a quality
education.
   One bill, called ``The Fair Chance Act,'' would require states
to spend an equal amount of education dollars for each student in
all areas of a state, or face the loss of federal funds.
   The other bill, ``The Regulatory Impact on Student Excellence
Act,'' would require the Education Department to determine if the
``non-teaching'' burdens on teachers and administrators are caused
by state or federal regulations.
   ``Our search for the twin goals of equity and excellence has
become stalled as a nation, as a people,'' Hawkins told reporters.
``By comparison, we are falling behind other major industrialized
nations.''
   But Education Department officials question the
constitutionality of the ``Fair Chance'' bill and the need for the
regulatory measure, arguing many states already are looking at
their own regulatory structures for change.
   ``I think there are grave constitutional questions,'' said Lon
Anderson, an aide to Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos. ``This is
having the federal government, which provides 5 percent to 6
percent funding to essentially control organizations contributing
94 percent to 96 percent.
   ``This really is a case of trying to make the tail wag the
dog,'' he said.
   Hawkins insisted his bills are needed, pointing to the CRS study
that found more than half the states spend double in some of their
school districts what they do in others. About one-third of the
states spend three times more in some districts as others.
   For example, the study said that in Illinois, the Germantown
elementary school district spends $1,162 per student, while Salt
Creek spends $7,040. In New Jersey, Laurel Springs Borough spends
$2,081, while Demarest Borough spends $12,556.
   The New York unified district of Corning City spends $3,091,
compared with Rotterdam-Draper Union's $15,159; Texas' unified
district of Jasper Independent spends $1,207, while Sundown
Independent spends $7,109; and Vermont's unified district of
Hardwick Town spends $1,664, while Essex Junction spends $8,315.
   Hawkins added large disparities also exist between states in
their spending for education.
   Although the Supreme Court has held there was no right to
contest state systems of finance under the Constitution, Hawkins
said courts in 11 states have ruled as unconstitutional disparate
system of financing education in violation of state constitutions.
   ``These lawsuits take many years to litigate, are very costly,
and are especially burdensome for poorer districts challenging such
unfair schemes of financing,'' said Hawkins. ``Therefore, federal
action is necessary to address this inequality.''
   The ``Fair Chance'' bill would require the education secretary
to review the way each state finances its school systems to make
sure state and local funding is fairly distributed. States would be
allowed to submit five-year plans to achieve equalization but would
be barred from receiving any funds from the Education Department
after Jan. 1, 1996, if found to be uncertified and without a plan.
   The legislation also would create a new federal program to
provide financial equalization between states to improve their
public schools.
   Charles Kolb, who oversees the Education Department's budget,
stressed, ``It may be an equity issue. It's simply not a federal
issue. I would think lawyers need to look at that.''

<TEXT>
   The Soviets may be prepared to offer
concessions to end the war in Afghanistan when Secretary of State
James A. Baker III visits Moscow next month, say administration
officials and a U.S. lawmaker.
   The key is ending Soviet support for the Afghan leader
Najibullah, and Kremlin officials hinted at such a shift during the
Malta summit last month and the October meeting between Baker and
his Soviet counterpart in Wyoming, said a State Department source.
   ``The Soviets at Wyoming and to a certain degree at Malta talked
about a transitional period. That to us implies moving away from a
Najib regime to whatever comes next,'' said the source, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The No. 3 man in the State Department, Robert M. Kimmitt,
returned Saturday from a trip to Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and India,
three nations that have played a role in the conflict. He found
wide support in those countries for such a political solution, said
the source.
   The trip by Kimmitt, who as undersecretary of state for
political affairs is a key administration player on Afghanistan,
did not produce any breakthroughs or shifts in the U.S. position,
said the source.
   Afghanistan is expected to be high on the agenda when Baker
meets again with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on
Feb. 6-7 in Moscow, other officials said.
   The Americans say the key to ending the Afghan civil war is
curbing Soviet support for Najib, as well as free elections in
Afghanistan, steps that a congressman just back from Moscow says
the Soviets are ready to take.
   ``Their position was that their world is on the edge of the
abyss, that this is a powerful irritant in relations with the
United States,'' said Rep. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, who recently
returned from a week of talks in Moscow.
   Senior Soviet officials said they were willing to stop shipping
weapons to Najibullah if the United States would cease arming the
mujahedeen guerrillas, a formula the Soviets rejected a year ago
when they began to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan, said
Wilson.
   Wilson met with Valentin Falin, a chief of the international
department of the Soviet Communist Party, and with the chief Soviet
envoy for Afghan affairs, Nikolai I. Kozrev.
   ``Their position was ... in one hour you stop supplying the
Mujahedeen and we will stop supplying Najibullah,'' Wilson said.
   ``In two hours, a cease-fire would enter effect. In a month, the
United Nations could organize and supervise elections, and let the
chips fall where they may,'' said Wilson, who has used his post on
the House Intelligence Committee to arrange shipments of advanced
arms to the mujahedeen.
   A State Department official said the formula presented to Wilson
might not be acceptable because Moscow has been shipping an
estimated $250 million to $300 million in weapons monthly to the
Najibullah government, leaving the regime much better armed than
the guerrillas.
   The level of U.S. aid to the mujahedeen is classified, but is
believed to run at about $600 million per year. Saudi Arabia also
contributes to the effort, and Pakistan distributes the arms to the
guerrillas through the Afghan Interim Government, based in
Peshawar, Pakistan.
   Wilson, a hardliner on the Soviet Union and the Afghan conflict,
said he left Moscow more sympathetic to the Kremlin position.
   ``The Russians had me there to talk about ways to negotiate an
end to the war in Afghanistan, presumably on the theory that if
they could persuade me, they could persuade anybody,'' he said.
   ``The talks always froze on one point, and that was whether the
mujahedeen were going to be compelled to negotiate with Najibullah.
My position was that Najibullah was covered with blood, that he was
the devil, that he was Hitler, that you couldn't ask people who had
sacrificed everything, including most of their relatives for the
past 10 years, to negotiate with the perpetrator of the crime,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Democratic Chairmen Tilt Toward Bill Bradley</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If Democratic Party leaders outside Washington
had to choose now, more would be inclined to nominate Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey for president than any other potential
contender, a survey suggests.
   Promising anonymity and seeking the opinions of hinterland
leaders _ those living beyond the outskirts of the nation's capital
_ Washingtonian magazine asked the Democratic chairmen in 50 states
and the District of Columbia to name the candidates they would most
like to see the party nominate in 1992 to run against George Bush
and Dan Quayle.
   Forty-five chairmen responded; Bradley got the most votes with
13.
   Bradley, a Rhodes scholar who was a Princeton University
basketball star and later played professionally for the New York
Knicks, is one Northeasterner considered acceptable in more
conservative regions.
   In fact, Bradley drew most of his support away from home.
   The magazine said five votes came from the West and three from
the South. One supporter penciled in the observation that Bradley
best could avoid the taint of ``the party's lunatic left fringe.''
   Two Southern chairmen were among those who liked Bradley for the
vice presidential slot.
   Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a Vietnam war hero, was the leading
choice for the vice presidential nomination, with the support of
eight chairmen.
   Presidential choices after Bradley were: New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo with eight votes; Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, seven; Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore, five; and Sens. Charles Robb of Virginia and Sam
Nunn of Georgia, three each.
   Trailing Kerrey for the No. 2 spot on the ticket were: Gore with
six votes; Bradley and Nunn with four apiece; and two each for Rep.
Bill Gray of Pennsylvania, the No. 3 Democratic leader in the
House, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, Sen. Bob Graham of Florida and
Bentsen, the vice presidential candidate on Michael Dukakis' 1988
ticket.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a contender for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988, had no votes.
   Most of the potential candidates dismiss questions with a
variation of the it's-too-early theme.
   ``I'm focusing on re-election,'' Gore said in December.
   ``I'm not running and I'm not making any plans to run,'' Bentsen
said.

   Census takers will visit shelters, flophouses
and missions in an effort to gauge the number of people who live on
the streets in the United States, but an advocate for the homeless
says street people should not cooperate.
   ``You can't count all the people in the streets,'' said Mitch
Snyder of the Center for Creative Non-Violence. ``Experience
quickly teaches the homeless that to be identified as such is to
risk harassment ... and abuse.''
   Snyder charged at a news conference Monday that both the Reagan
and Bush administrations have sought to minimize the problem of
homelessness in America, saying that because many homeless would be
missed the census results will lead to less money and less
attention for the needy.
   ``If we were dealing with an honest government and an honest
administration, we would cooperate,'' Snyder said.
   To demonstrate his refusal, Snyder burned census envelopes that
had been used to send him materials about the effort.
   ``I'm very sorry they feel this way, I really am. I hope we can
work with them and get them to feel differently by the date of the
census,'' said Peter A. Bounpane, assistant census director.
   The Census Bureau will make every effort to count the homeless
and if people obstruct that, everybody loses, Bounpane said.
Federal money is distributed on the basis of population.
   The special effort to count the homeless nationwide is scheduled
for March 20, when census takers will visit shelters for the
homeless, flophouses, hospitals, missions and count people on the
streets. The regular census will begin April 1.
   The bureau is recruiting advocates for the homeless, and
homeless themselves, to participate. Snyder said that by refusing
to participate, he hopes to bring public attention the problems of
the homeless and make people understand why it's impossible to
count them.
   There are no accurate figures available of the number of people
affected by homelessness..
   The National Alliance to End Homelessness, a private research
and assistance group, estimates that as many as 2 million people
are homeless for at least a portion of the year and that the number
has been growing.
   The Partnership for the Homeless in New York issued a similar
estimate after a national survey of 46 cities.
   A 1984 study by the Department of Housing and Urban Development
estimated the number of homeless at 250,000 to 350,000; a Harvard
study put the total at 350,000 in 1986; an Urban Institute report
in 1988 estimated the total at about 600,000.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has estimated the total homeless
at 3 million.
   Counting the homeless correctly is impossible because people
move around and fear government officials, Snyder said.
   ``The key to survival for homeless people is invisibility. If
you are a homeless woman with children, you deny being homeless
because you don't want to lose the children,'' said David Hayden of
the Justice House Community, a shelter in Roanoke, Va.
   Hayden said he, too, would refuse to cooperate.
   Snyder said that other groups will cooperate with the national
count and that opinion about participation is divided in the
National Coalition for the Homeless.

<TEXT>
   A former state lottery director and his
mistress are picking up the pieces of their ruined lives following
a scandal that has led the state to investigate the private affairs
of candidates for top state jobs.
   Jack F. Crawford, once a rising star in the state Democratic
Party, said he was seeking help for psychological problems after
being forced to resign as director of the Hoosier Lottery last
month. His former girlfriend, who was on the lottery payroll as
human resources director, alleged he sexually harassed her.
   ``I just want to be left alone,'' said the 41-year-old Crawford,
who has a wife and two sons.
   His former girlfriend, Mary L. Cartwright, 49, was fired from
her job and has faced the difficulty of explaining the affair to
her family, including a father and brother who are Baptist
ministers and were unaware of it until it broke in the media.
   ``I knew a lot of bad things could happen and I was emotionally
prepared for some of it _ not for all this, but for some of it,''
she said. ``My family couldn't be prepared for it.''
   Meanwhile, in the wake of the scandal, the state plans to
include questions about extramarital sexual activity in its
interviews with candidates for top government jobs, according to an
aide to Gov. Evan Bayh.
   ``The intent is not to eliminate from state government persons
that have had affairs. That is not a disqualifier for service in
state government,'' Bayh's press secretary, Fred Nation, said
Monday. ``Certainly, having an affair with a subordinate on the
state payroll would be a disqualifier.''
   Cartwright had worked for Crawford in northern Indiana 13 years
as a secretary and office manager, first when he was a Hammond city
judge and later when he was Lake County prosecutor. Their sexual
relationship began in 1980, Cartwright said in her formal complaint
filed with the governor's office. By some years later, however,
Cartwright wished to end it.
   After Bayh named Crawford as lottery director last June,
Crawford offered Cartwright a $48,000 job as human resources
director, although she had no college degree.
   In a handwritten contract, Crawford promised her weekly $125
payments, half of Crawford's $10,000 bonus for launching the
lottery ticket sales a full month before the Nov. 15 deadline, and
a promotion to lottery director should Crawford become governor.
   Cartwright claimed Crawford also promised to treat her more
professionally if she took the job, and said in the contract that
he would not ``harass, intimidate or annoy Mary L. Cartwright
concerning her social activities.''
   That promise was his undoing, proving that sexual harassment
existed, according to state officials.
   ``You don't promise not to do something you haven't done,'' said
D. William Moreau, Bayh's chief of staff.
   Cartwright told of being forced to endure Crawford's advances,
having sex in the lottery offices and being threatened with the
loss of her job if she failed to comply.
   On Dec. 10, about a week after Cartwright lodged her complaint,
Crawford was confronted with Cartwright's allegations. Aides to
Gov. Bayh showed him copies of the handwritten contract between the
two, plus a will he had signed bequeathing Cartwright half of his
estate, with the other half to be divided between his wife and two
sons.
   He quietly agreed to resign _ on the condition, he said, that
the documents that detailed his relationship with Cartwright would
not be made public.
   For nearly a month, the documents were held in confidence.
   But two weeks ago, Cartwright told her side of the story to the
media, adding allegations that Indiana State Police illegally
entered her apartment to search for documents, and that a state
government official and a state police officer had plotted to kill
her.
   On Jan. 10, Cartwright was fired for making ``false and
outrageous statements'' to the media.
   Now, both she and Crawford are trying to recover from the
scandal.
   Crawford said he planned to seek medical attention for ``some
serious psychological problems.''
   He planned to move back to Lake County, in northwestern Indiana,
where his wife and sons have retreated.
   Cartwright said she plans to move back to her family in Hammond
later this month instead of waiting until her teen-age daughter
gets out of school in June.
   ``It's just an unbelievable situation for my family,'' she said.
``But they are warm, they are caring, they are there for me. And I
need them now.''

   The head of a House subcommittee says
allegations a generic drug company bought bulk supplies of a drug
from an unauthorized distributor are ``very disturbing.''
   The allegations involve Quantum Pharmics Inc. of Amityville,
N.Y., and its antifungal drug nystatin. The company recalled 29
lots of the product in November because of subpotentcy problems.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce investigations subcommittee, said if the allegations are
true, ``certain firms and individuals may be engaged in the sale
and purchase of misbranded and, perhaps, adulterated raw
materials.''
   Dingell's subcommittee has been investigating the FDA's handling
of generic drugs for more than a year.
   Carol Emerling, a spokeswoman for American Home Products, which
owns Quantum, said the company was unaware of the allegations until
informed by the subcommittee last week.
   ``We have no idea whether the allegations are accurate,'' she
said, adding the company will cooperate with any investigation.
   Jeff Nesbit, a spokesman for the FDA, said the agency began
investigating the allegations after getting a letter earlier this
month from Agvar Chemicals Inc., the only U.S. agent licensed to
sell nystatin, made by Chinoin Pharmaceuticals of Budapest, Hungary.
   In the letter, Agvar attorney Frank Sasinowski said Quantum
asked Agvar to accept return of the subpotent nystatin, apparently
believing the nystatin had originated with Chinoin. But Agvar said
it has never sold its Chinoin nystatin to Quantum.
   The letter also said Quantum told Agvar representatives it had
bought nystatin it believed to be from Chinoin from other
distributors, including one who delivered the nystatin from the
trunk of his car in exchange for cash.
   Because nystatin must be kept at under 5 degrees Celsius,
improper handling can affect the potency of the product, the letter
said.

<HEAD>US Weighs Diplomatic Relations With Marxist Yemen</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is considering renewing
diplomatic links with strategically-located South Yemen despite the
Middle Eastern nation's Marxist ideology and past support of
terrorist groups.
   The issue will be discussed Wednesday when President Bush meets
at the White House with the President of North Yemen, Ali Abdullah
Saleh, said a senior administration official.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Monday
that U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering met with the representative
of South Yemen at the United Nations three or four times last fall.
   ``Well, we've had the discussions. We're thinking it over. We're
talking _ we're going to be discussing the subject with the
President of North Yemen while he's here,'' the official said.
   The United States is also discussing the matter with Oman and
Saudi Arabia, two U.S. allies who have clashed repeatedly with
neighboring South Yemen over its support for insurgents in Oman and
other countries in the volatile region, said the official.
   Pickering also discussed with South Yemen's representative his
government's support for terrorism, the official said.
   South Yemen is one of six countries under U.S. economic boycott
for their support of international terrorism. The others are Libya,
Cuba, North Korea, Syria and Iran.
   North Yemen, which enjoys good relations with both superpowers,
has had diplomatic ties with the United States since 1946. The
south, which was a British protectorate until it gained
independence in 1967, broke off ties with the United States after
aligning itself with Moscow and adopting a Marxist ideology. The
country, at the tip of the Red Sea, became a major facility for
Soviet naval units in the Indian Ocean.
   The talks with the United States were prompted by moves toward
reform in South Yemen, following upheaval in the governments of
other Soviet allies. The reforms have also lent impetus to a
decade-old effort to unify north and south, with the two countries
agreeing this week to prepare a joint constitution for a referendum
by Nov. 30.
   But U.S. officials believe the unification process will take
time and say this does not influence considerations about possible
diplomatic ties with South Yemen.
   An eventual union between the two countries would not ``do any
damage to U.S. interests,'' the official said.

<HEAD>Nancy Reagan's Oval Office Rug Sent to Storeroom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An expensive rug that Nancy Reagan helped
design and left behind in the Oval Office as ``an attractive
asset'' is now relegated to a government storeroom, supposedly
because President Bush doesn't like it.
   ``It was not terribly attractive. The president (Bush) did not
like it,'' said Larry Hokanson, president of a Houston company that
made a $28,550 rug as a replacement.
   The new rug was installed on Friday as part of a $62,470
refurbishing of the Oval Office, which also included new draperies,
a Chinese-style mahogany coffee table, reupholstered high-back
armchairs and a pair of new, three-cushion sofas.
   The Reagan rug, two years in the design and making, had been
purchased at a cost of $49,625 by an anonymous donor at Mrs.
Reagan's request. The first lady had worked with the White House
curator and White House Historical Association to design the rug
and get a donor.
   The rug, decorated with 40 custom-dyed colors with a predominant
theme of peach, or coral, was installed in June 1988 while the
Reagans were in Moscow. It replaced a 12-year-old rug.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, the press
secretary for both Reagan and Bush, had said 18 months ago that the
Reagans ``wanted to leave an asset to the White House and they felt
this would be an attractive asset.''
   On Monday, Fitzwater said that Bush ``is pleased with his new
decorations ... I think they are beautiful.''
   ``Most presidents put their own imprimatur on their office,''
said Alixe Glen, White House deputy press secretary.
   Mark Weinberg, a spokesman for the Reagans, declined comment
about the replacement.
   The new rug, made with the assistance of New York interior
decorator Mark Hampton, measures 30 feet, 10 inches long by 23
feet, 5 inches wide. Like the old one, the new rug is oval.
   ``Normally, the designing process takes a couple months and the
normal manufacturing time is about 16 to 18 weeks, but because of
the prestige of this, we cut all that back to two weeks on
designing and 2{ months on production,'' Hokanson said.
   He said every stitch of the all-wool rug was done with a
hand-guided, electric-powered needle and that 20 to 30 people were
involved in the production and design.
   The new rug has a gray-blue field that centers the coat-of-arms
from the presidential seal, delineated in shades of gold on an
ivory ground. There is a border of gold rods tied with blue
ribbons, also on an ivory ground.
   The White House statement said the border's design was ``derived
from the fasces, a classical Roman symbol of the governing
authority which appears as the carved moldings above the Oval
Office doorways.''

   A man who was returning from the movies with his
son beat to death a homeless man after an altercation on a subway
platform, police said.
   Transit Police say the unidentified homeless man started the
fight Sunday night by harassing, spitting at and hitting Rodney
Sumter, 39, who was returning from the movies with his 3-year-old
son.
   After the homeless man fell, Sumter banged the man's head on the
concrete platform and kicked him in the head, causing his death,
witnesses said.
   Sumter, who police said had no criminal record, was charged with
first-degree manslaughter. That means he intended to cause physical
injury, said Colleen Roche, spokeswoman for the district attorney's
office.
   The criminal complaint did not say what provoked the fight, she
said.
   The fight occurred in the large underground 59th Street station,
one of several in the city that have attracted large numbers of the
homeless, who panhandle passengers and sleep on benches.
   Witnesses said the homeless man _ estimated to be in his 60s _
was a regular at the station.
   Sumter remained on the platform after the fight and was there
when police arrived, police spokesman Al O'Leary said. His wife
picked up the child later.

<HEAD>Watkins Seeks Greater Federal Control of Weapons Plant Audits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, moving to
restore public confidence in nuclear weapons plants, plans to put
federal workers in place of some private contractors who perform
environmental investigations of the facilities.
   Watkins, in an internal memorandum made available to The
Associated Press on Monday, wrote that although he was pleased with
weapons plants investigations completed last fall, he wanted more
federal employees doing the audits from now on.
   ``These assessments form the cornerstone of my overall plan to
create a new culture of self-assessment and accountability within
the department and are essential to bringing all of the
department's facilities into full compliance'' with regulations,
Watkins wrote in the memo to senior aides dated Dec. 22.
   Watkins started the audits, which he terms ``independent tiger
team'' evaluations, last June to gain a fresh view of
environmental, safety and health problems at the plants. Eight
weapons plants were audited last year, five others will be examined
this month and seven more will be done later this year.
   In his memo, Watkins asked field offices across the country to
submit federal candidates for slots on coming ``tiger team''
audits. He did not say how many contractor positions the federal
workers would replace.
   Peter Brush, acting assistant secretary for environment, safety
and health, said in an interview Monday that Watkins wants to use
more federal workers and fewer contractors partly out of concern
about possible conflicts of interest among the contractors.
   ``We would like ... less of a perception of contractors
overseeing contractors,'' Brush said. ``One contractor overseeing
another contractor of necessity is going to have, in the public's
mind, somewhat less credibility.''
   All 17 major nuclear weapons plants and laboratories are owned
by the Energy Department but run by private contractors.
   Brush was responding to an Associated Press report that at least
two contractors used on investigations last fall are on the payroll
at the facilities they investigated.
   The AP also reported others participating in the audits were
bidding at that time on Energy Department contracts for related
work at sites they investigated.
   Brush said Watkins had no alternative to relying heavily on
contractors for this work.
   ``There is a real shortage of the kind of senior, qualified
environment and safety people we need to do this job right, and we
don't have them on the federal payroll,'' Brush said, adding
Watkins would ask for more money to hire such experts.
   The ``tiger teams'' are supervised by federal employees, but
most of the technical work is done by contractors.
   Department records show one contractor, NUS Corp., a consulting
firm based at Gaithersburg, Md., took part in evaluating the Oak
Ridge nuclear weapons complex in Tennessee last fall. At the time,
NUS was being paid by the department to help plan a nuclear waste
management strategy for Oak Ridge.
   Brush said he was not familiar with the NUS Oak Ridge contract,
but department spokeswoman Catherine Kaliniak said later the
department determined that NUS' Oak Ridge work would not bias its
judgment in the ``tiger team'' work.
   She said ``it was determined that a conflict did not exist.''
   Written department guidelines for carrying out the ``tiger
team'' evaluations include a provision aimed at avoiding
organizational conflicts of interest. It defines such a conflict as
a situation in which a contractor ``has past, present or currently
planned interests that either directly or indirectly ... may relate
to the work to be performed'' and which may bias its judgment.
   Another contractor, ICF Kaiser Engineers of Oakland, Calif.,
which was on a ``tiger team'' that evaluated the Fernald uranium
processing plant in Ohio last fall, also was bidding then for an
11-year contract to design an environmental cleanup plan for
Fernald, according to Oak Ridge and ICF Kaiser officials.
   Brush said he was not familiar with this case.

<HEAD>HUD Finds Housing Officials Multiplying Salaries With Numerous
Titles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp is cracking down
on federally funded housing authorities in New Jersey, suspending
top housing officials in Passaic because they accepted ``grossly
excessive'' salaries.
   Kemp is also serving notice to housing authorities nationwide
that he will not tolerate the misuse of public housing funds, in
the paying of salaries or in other areas.
   ``The actions of these individuals are a clear violation of the
public trust and a betrayal of the low-income families in Passaic
who need housing assistance,'' Kemp said in a statement Monday.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development also set up a
New Jersey strike force to examine the financial management of
local housing authorities throughout the state.
   HUD directed the remaining members of the Passaic authority to
prepare to sue for the recovery of excessive compensation paid out
over several years.
   The tough steps are part of Kemp's attempt to demonstrate he is
serious in his vows to end to the financial scandals that have
plagued the department.
   HUD's inspector general's office said in a report that
investigators found $1.68 million in ineligible and unsupported
costs at the Passaic Housing Authority, which administers 891
rented or leased low income units.
   The authority is under the control of a local board of
commissioners but receives millions of dollars in federal
low-income housing subsidies from HUD each year.
   The report said Paul Marguglio, the executive director of the
Passaic authority, was paid $245,956 in 1988, more than double
Kemp's salary as housing secretary. The deputy director, Donald V.
Pieri, was paid $106,868 in 1988. The authority's attorney, August
Michaelis, was paid $486,327 over three years.
   All three were suspended Monday morning along with Peter
Marrocco, chairman of the board of commissioners, and William P.
Scruggs, the board's vice chairman.
   The HUD inspector general also found alleged abuse of
government-funded travel, abuse of credit cards, abuse of vacation
policy and failure to follow federal property management standards.
   The report said the authorized salary for Marguglio was $84,185
and Pieri was authorized a $57,970 annual salary.
   But the Passaic Housing Authority allowed employees to be
compensated for multiple job titles, gave salary increases, paid
bonuses, paid compensatory time, paid into the executive director's
retirement annuity and authorized travel allowances the HUD
inspector general considered compensation.
   ``This occurred because the board of commissioners approved
resolutions authorizing these payments,'' the inspector general's
report said. ``By approving the resolutions and allowing
compensation to exceed the HUD approved budget, the board did not
exercise proper oversight.''
   Joseph Schiff, acting assistant secretary for public housing,
said a bulletin is being sent to housing authorities throughout the
country serving notice that HUD has a clear policy of one person,
one job, one salary, no matter how many titles a job may carry.
   In a formal response, signed by Marguglio, the Passaic Housing
Authority declared it did nothing wrong and asserted that because
HUD had never objected to the resolutions increasing compensation
for the officials, ``acceptance of the resolutions by HUD
constituted official and unofficial approval.''
   ``Our primary mission of providing adequate low-cost housing has
been performed admirably,'' Marguglio declared.
   ``The continuation of this high level of performance should not
be impaired by findings and recommendations which, however well
intentioned, may be inappropriate or improper,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush Fills Legal Services Board With Recess Appointments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, seeking to avoid the wrangling
with conservatives that last year cost him a nomination to the
Legal Services Corp., is using a procedural move to fill all 11
seats on the embattled organization's board.
   The White House announced late Monday that Bush gave nine more
individuals so-called recess appointments to the board that
oversees the independent agency's legal aid to the nation's poor.
They join two similar appointments he made in December.
   Under the Constitution, people appointed by the president while
the House and Senate are in a prolonged recess _ as they have been
_ can serve without Senate confirmation until the end of the next
session of the Senate, in this case the end of this year.
   Bush made the appointments at the last possible minute. Congress
returns today from a two-month winter recess.
   The move was immediately derided by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources.
   ``President Bush has had a year to choose these nominees,''
Kennedy said in a statement late Monday. ``He should have waited
another 18 hours and sent them to the Senate for confirmation, as
the Constitution provides. I hope that the Senate will make its
opposition clear to any of these appointees who are not committed
in good faith to providing legal services to the poor.''
   A White House spokeswoman, Alixe Glen, said Bush took the step
to avoid protracted confirmation battles in the Senate over the
board members, as has happened several times in the past. Last
year, conservatives forced the president to withdraw a nominee they
deemed as too moderate.
   Five of the appointments made Monday will serve only through
July 13, thus they can serve out the terms without requiring any
Senate action.
   They are: Howard H. Dana Jr., a Portland, Maine, attorney; Luis
Guinot Jr., of Puerto Rico, currently a Washington attorney; Penny
L. Pullen, House Republican leader in the Illinois legislature;
Xavier L. Suarz, the mayor of Miami; and George W. Wittgraf, an
attorney in Cherokee, Iowa.
   Four other appointments were made to terms expiring July 13,
1992. They will be subject to Senate confirmation if Bush resubmits
their names once their recess appointments expire.
   They are: John F. Collins of Massachusetts, listed only as
``self employed;'' Jo Bets Love of Mississippi, no occupation
listed; former Rep. Guy Molinari, R-N.Y., the Staten Island, N.Y.,
borough chairman; and Jeannie E. Wolbeck of Minnesota, no
occupation listed.
   Last month, Bush gave recess appointments to former Rep. John
Erlenborn, R-Ill., and Texas attorney J. Blakely Hall to the board.
   Conservatives have targeted the agency for abolishment since
1981.
   More recently conservatives have sought to limit legal services,
particularly class-action lawsuits against the government over
welfare and other social programs.
   In 1989, conservatives successfully lobbied the White House to
stop the appointment of former Republican Rep. Caldwell Butler of
Virginia to the board. Butler had angered conservatives by saying
he opposed restrictions on the activities of legal aid attorneys.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry, facing a cocaine
possession charge, flew to Florida for treatment Monday while
political speculation intensified back home concerning a possible
City Hall campaign by Jesse Jackson.
   Barry's spokeswoman, Lurma Rackley, said the mayor had checked
into a center in West Palm Beach, Fla., to be treated for
alcoholism. She had said the day before that details about his
health would be kept private but ``the most serious problem is
alcoholism.''
   With Barry gone from City Hall for at least 30 days, talk and
maneuvering in connection with the November election picked up
speed.
   A Jackson associate said of the civil rights leader who moved to
Washington last year, ``I know he's getting a lot of pressure to
run. I don't know if he's going to.''
   Speaking only on condition of anonymity, the source said ``a lot
of the pressure is coming from Marion's people.''
   Barry left Washington without speaking to reporters, but several
hours later, Ms. Rackley said the mayor had entered the
Hanley-Hazelden Treatment Center in Florida.
   The mayor was arrested Thursday night and charged with
possession of crack cocaine. He said on Sunday he would take steps
to ``heal my body, mind and soul.'' Barry, who did not specifically
refer to a drug or alcohol problem in his Sunday remarks, left his
home at dawn Monday accompanied by his wife Effi.
   Later, Mrs. Barry and one of the mayor's bodyguards returned to
Washington.
   The 60-bed Florida clinic is an affiliate of a Minnesota clinic
that has treated more than 70,000 people since 1949, including
Washington Redskins football star Dexter Manley and Kitty Dukakis,
wife of Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts. Its techniques were
adopted by the better-known Betty Ford clinic in Rancho Mirage,
Calif.
   Barry's plans to announce his candidacy Sunday for a fourth term
as mayor of the nation's capital were abruptly canceled after his
arrest on the misdemeanor cocaine charge.
   Meanwhile, at the White House Monday, NAACP Executive Director
Benjamin L. Hooks met with President Bush and then told reporters
he was concerned about ``selective enforcement of the law.''
   Hooks said newspaper accounts of Barry's arrest in an FBI sting
operation made it sound like ``the search had finally paid off. `We
spent all of these years trying to find him with a grain of
cocaine, and by God we did it, didn't we?'
   ``We haven't found all the people who've stolen all the money
from the savings and loan associations and are driving Rolls Royces
and Jaguars, so obviously many of us in the black community will
have some peculiar feelings as we go further,'' said Hooks.
   As Barry mulled his future over the weekend, some of his closest
political advisers and former assistants were meeting at the home
of ex-city administrator Elijah Rogers to organize plans to get
Jackson in the mayor's race.
   Jackson's move to Washington last April fueled rumors that he
would make a bid for the mayor's chair. But the two-time
presidential candidate has repeatedly said he would never run
against Barry, a friend and former civil rights colleague.
   Early surveys of public sentiment in the mayor's race gave
Jackson a wide lead over all other potential contenders, including
Barry.
   Ron Richardson, president of the local chapter of the Hotel and
Restaurant Workers AFL-CIO, said he has had discussions with a
variety of community activists and organizers about mounting a
draft-Jackson campaign.
   ``We are going to plead with him to submerge his personal
interests and help heal this city, which is what we need right
now,'' Richardson said. ``My indications are that people that I've
been talking to _ labor leaders, ministers, others _ are
overwhelmingly in favor of trying to get Jackson in the race.''
   At Saturday's strategy session were Rogers, former Deputy Mayors
Ivanhoe Donaldson and Alphonse Hill, former city official Courtland
Cox and several others, said a source familiar with the meeting.
   Donaldson and Hill have served jail time for felony convictions
in connection with their city government jobs. Donaldson, once
Barry's top assistant in the government, has known the mayor since
their days in the civil rights movement and is widely credited with
shaping Barry's rise to power.
   Donaldson spent part of the weekend telephoning other Barry
supporters to ask them to get behind a Jackson candidacy, said one
Barry aide who received such a call.
   Eric Easter, Jackson's press secretary, said the former
Democratic presidential hopeful has been sick in bed since
returning to the nation's capital on Saturday and has met with no
one regarding a mayoral draft campaign.
   Meanwhile, City Administrator Carol B. Thompson, who is running
the government in the mayor's absence, said at a press conference
Monday that while Barry ``is still mayor of this city,'' she will
not hesitate to make tough decisions associated with the job.
   Thompson is prohibited from signing legislation or authorizing
most city contracts or spending packages. She said that she will be
in daily telephone contact with Barry, and that the mayor will
regularly be sent documents and legislation requiring his signature.
   ``We've acted in the mayor's absence before, we've managed the
government in the past, and we're up to that today,'' Thompson
said. ``There will be continued stability and continuity and there
will be progress.''
   Thompson also was meeting with congressional leaders. Congress
has substantial control over policy in the federal district.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez has proposed
investing $3.2 billion during the next decade to save threatened
beaches, mangrove islands, Everglades patches and other wilderness
areas from rampant development.
   An environmentalist said the plan would ``change the face of
Florida.''
   ``It's time we move forward to safeguard our heritage, before
these special lands are developed or priced beyond grasp,''
Martinez said Monday.
   ``We can greatly increase our land-acquisition capabilities, or
we can continue to fall further behind every year.''
   Without the plan, only $650 million would be available for land
acquisition during the next decade, Martinez said.
   He said it was too early to project how much land the $3.2
billion might buy.
   The plan must be approved by the Legislature, where the
Republican governor said it has bipartisan support. It is being
sponsored by Democratic Sen. George Kirkpatrick and Republican Rep.
Tom Drage.
   Charles Lee of the Florida Audubon Society called the plan ``the
single most significant proposal yet made to reach to the problems
that are destroying the environment.''
   ``After the next decade, when much of Florida is paved over in
subdivisions, parking lots and shopping centers, there will be less
and less opportunity to have an initiative such as this,'' Lee said.
   Examples of land environmentalists want saved are the sandy
beaches and forested tracts in the Florida Panhandle, freshwater
springs in northern Florida, river wetlands in central Florida and
mangrove islands in southern Florida.
   The Everglades, a subtropical marsh covering much of southern
Florida, also is a focus of ecological concern. It is bordered by
an area of unprecedented development in recent decades, with the
coast from Miami to West Palm Beach now estimated to have a
population of 4 million.
   Last month, President Bush signed into law a measure expanding
Everglades National Park by 110,000 acres, bringing it to more than
1.5 million acres _ but about six-sevenths of the Everglades
remains unprotected.
   The proposal arose out of recommendations from the 29-member
Commission on the Future of Florida's Environment, chaired by
Nathaniel Reed, an environmentalist and former assistant U.S.
Secretary of the Interior.
   ``This, I think, is going to change the face of Florida more
than any single thing that I can think of,'' Reed said. ``I think
there's an enormous amount of broad public support for this
initiative.''
   The proposal calls for selling $300 million in bonds each year
starting with the 1991-92 budget, using expected growth in a tax on
real-estate transfers to repay the debt. That growth is expected to
reach $30 million per year.
   No new or increased taxes would be imposed, Martinez said, and
the bulk of the money would go for land that either would be left
in its natural state or used for recreation.
   The bonds would be paid back over 30 years, but Martinez said
the debt was worth it.
   ``This property is for the future. Land is forever,'' Martinez
said.

   President Bush assured 75,000 abortion opponents marching in the
nation's capital he was their ally, and demonstrators on both sides
held rallies around the country on the 17th anniversary of Roe vs.
Wade.
   In a telephone hookup to demonstrators across from the White
House, Bush spoke Monday ``of the self-evident moral superiority of
adoption over abortion,'' and said he opposed the 1973 Supreme
Court ruling that legalized abortion.
   ``Let me assure that this president stands with you on this
issue of life,'' he said.
   In Sacramento, Calif., a state senator prohibited by her bishop
from receiving Communion for her stand in favor of abortion rights
told a flag-waving rally of 1,000 not to be discouraged by the
president's stand.
   ``We'll get our message all the way to the White House, where
Barbara Bush sits in quiet support,'' said California Sen. Lucy
Killea. ``Mr. President, please, read your wife's lips.''
   Mrs. Bush has refused to answer interviewers' questions about
her views on the abortion issue, but a report in this week's
Newsweek magazine said she disagreed with her husband.
   This year's commemoration of Roe vs. Wade carried special
meaning because of a Supreme Court ruling last summer in a Missouri
case that gave states greater latitude to impose restrictions on
abortion.
   The decision in Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services upheld
Missouri's law banning abortions in public hospitals and stopped
government employees from counseling women about abortions. It also
required doctors performing abortions to first test any fetus over
20 weeks old to determine if it could live outside the womb.
   It also led to speculation the high court would overturn Roe vs.
Wade.
   In rallies Monday from Spokane, Wash., to Boston, foes and
supporters of abortion rights threatened political retribution
against politicians who disagree with them.
   ``It will be a cutting edge issue in this year's elections,''
Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore., told abortion-rights supporters in
Washington.
   Sarah Weddington, the Texas lawyer who argued for overturning
abortion laws in the Roe case, told a breakfast in Dallas: ``We are
here to say we won 17 years ago today, and we will win again.''
   In Atlanta, the Rev. Pat Robertson, the evangelical broadcaster
who sought the 1988 Republican presidential nomination, shared the
podium with Roman Catholic Archbishop Eugene Marino at a rally
attended by 10,000 people to urge new state restrictions.
   ``This nation is on trial for its soul, and men and women and
children who believe in life had better be concerned and had better
let their voices be heard,'' Marino said.
   But Rep. Charles Thomas, the chairman of the Georgia House
Judiciary Committee, said the prevailing sentiment of most
legislators is that they do not want to handle the topic during
this election-year session.
   In Nebraska, the Legislature chose Monday's anniversary to begin
its debate on a bill that would require minors seeking abortion to
notify their parents. Lawmakers adjourned for the day without
voting.
   In Dallas, Texans United for Life urged abortion foes to send
thousands of baby rattles to lawmakers to ``rattle the conscience
of Texas.''
   In Charlotte, N.C., a Planned Parenthood chapter set up three
mobile telephones for abortion rights advocates to pay $3 to call
Gov. Jim Martin and Bush.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, at a conference of family planning
advocates in Albany, said both sides could find common ground in
promoting sexual abstinence among teen-agers.
   ``At the very least, young men and women should hear from us, it
seems to me, that they are not abnormal because they choose to
abstain until another and better time,'' Cuomo said. ``I think,
frankly, that it is a mistake that history has left the alternative
of restraint behind as a sociological anachronism.''

   A minor earthquake rattled the residents
of this town west of Boston, but police reported no damage or
injuries.
   The tremor measured about 2.5 on the Richter scale, said Dr.
John Ebel, assistant director of Boston College's Weston
Observatory. It occurred at 7:41 p.m. Monday with an epicenter
about two miles south of Littleton.
   Ebel said there were several geological fault lines that run
through the Littleton-Boxboro area, about 20 miles northwest of
Boston.
   ``It shook the building and felt like it was coming off the
foundation,'' Boxboro policeman Richard Priest said. ``It was
really loud .. We thought it was an explosion.''
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause
slight damage in the local area.

<HEAD>Red Tape Stops Thousands Of Toys Destined For Panama</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of toys gathered as Christmas gifts for
Panamanian children are wrapped up instead in government red tape,
but the frustrated organizer of the gift drive is determined to cut
through it.
   In her quest to deliver the toys, Patricia Gehri has even asked
the military to fly the toys to Panama under a law which permits
airlifting for humanitarian efforts.
   ``They don't take it seriously because it's toys and not food or
medicine,'' she said. ``But a teddy bear is medicine to me.''
   Gehri, 45, has amassed almost 8,000 teddy bears, games, dolls,
tea sets and toy trucks to distribute to Panamanian children who
spent Christmas in the middle of a military invasion.
   ``We have enough toys for the kids in refugee camps, hospitals
and orphanages,'' said Gehri, who collected about half the items
from the public and the other half through the U.S. Marine Corps'
Toys for Tots program. ``The toys are just waiting for
transportation.''
   Military rules prevent certain planes from landing in Panama,
where the military has remained since the Dec. 20 invasion to oust
former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, Gehri said.
   Capt. Katie Haddock, deputy director of Joint Public Affairs for
the Marines, said ``interservice negotiations'' have held up the
toy delivery because the Marines are not the branch of service in
charge of the military presence in Panama.
   Gehri, a former flight attendant who lives in Orlando, was
disabled in September 1988 by a severe head injury. After
recovering her speech and other lost functions, her therapist
suggested she take on a project so ``I could feel good about
myself,'' she said.
   ``The only gift I want is one picture of one child holding one
of these teddy bears with a big smile,'' she said. ``If something
doesn't happen soon, we'll have to start collecting Easter
bunnies.''
   The Marines have stored some 6,000 toys in Tampa, Miami and in
Orlando. There are also 1,500 waiting in Atlanta, she said.
   On Monday, a Marine truck pulled up to Gehri's house and dumped
1,500 teddy bears in her garage because they had no more room for
the stuffed animals at Marine headquarters.
   ``We are working now to coordinate efforts to get the toys to
Panama,'' said Maj. John Flanagan of the Miami Marine Corp Reserve,
where about 2,000 toys are stored.
   Gehri has enlisted the help of U.S. Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., to
speed the process up because ``the government is just rumbling
along,'' she said.
   Brian Riley, spokesman for Mack's Washington office, said the
senator is trying ``to do everything he can on the federal and
military level.''

<TEXT>
   The World Bank will lend Mexico $7.5 billion
as a result of Mexico's success in reshaping its economy, the
bank's president said.
   Barber Conable, the World Bank president, told the government
news agency Notimex on Monday that Mexico will get an immediate
loan of $900 million and the rest will come over the next three
years.
   With this loan, the World Bank is becoming the principal source
of new funds coming into Mexico, Conable said. He said the purpose
of his visit is to show the organization's support for Mexico's
economic reforms.
   Conable, who is staying in Mexico until Friday, is scheduled to
meet with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Treasury Secretary
Pedro Aspe and Mexico City Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis.
   On Feb. 4, the Mexican government and its creditor banks are to
sign an agreement they recently reached on restructuring Mexico's
$48.5 billion commercial bank debt. It will knock $2 billion off
the $9 billion Mexico has been paying in interest every year and
provide Mexico with $1.5 billion in new loans annually.
   Salinas' government has brought annual inflation down to under
20 percent, opened Mexico's markets to foreign competition, and
sought foreign investment by liberalizing regulations.
   Mexico's total foreign debt is $107 billion, second only in the
developing world to the $120 billion Brazil owes foreign creditors.

<HEAD>Photographer Who Documented Pre-Holocaust Jewish Life Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Vishniac, a biologist and photographer
renowned for his recording of Jewish life in Eastern Europe on the
eve of the Holocaust, has died at age 92.
   ``He used to say he took Hitler seriously and therefore he took
the pictures,'' said a relative, Jesse Cherry. ``Everything he
photographed was subsequently destroyed.''
   Vishniac died Monday of colon cancer at his Manhattan apartment.
   He was born in Russia and studied zoology and biology in Moscow.
In 1918, he immigrated to Latvia and soon thereafter traveled to
Berlin as a medical science photographer.
   Vishniac soon turned his camera on his surroundings and the Nazi
demonstrations he saw. Because any Jew with a camera was suspect,
he often posed as a Nazi to take the pictures.
   Just before World War II he fled to France and came with his
family to the United States in 1940.
   In 1971, the International Fund for Concerned Photography
mounted an exhibition of Vishniac's photographs that included his
scientific work, such as polarized light shots of microscopic
creatures.
   In an introduction to the exhibition, the photographer Edward
Steichen wrote: ``Roman Vishniac came back from his trips to
Eastern Europe in the 1930s with a collection of photographs that
has become an important historical document, for it gives a
last-minute look at the human beings he photographed just before
the fury of Nazi brutality exterminated them. The resulting
photographs are among photography's finest documents of a time and
place.''
   Vishniac's works are included in the permanent collections of
the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Smithsonian Institute and
Library of Congress in Washington and the Jewish Museum in New York.
   His works also were published in books, including ``A Vanished
World,'' which he authored in 1983.
   He is survived by his wife, Edith, a daughter and numerous
grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   A judge has barred the press and public from
juvenile court proceedings stemming from an investigation into a
reported rape at the South Dakota governor's mansion.
   Circuit Judge Marshall Young decided Monday to close next week's
hearings after news organizations covering the case said they could
not guarantee the names of the three juveniles who have been
charged would not be published.
   ``I can't let the media in and then have them turn around and
violate the law'' by publishing names, Young said. ``Apparently
there's no middle ground.''
   Officials have said they cannot disclose the names of the
juveniles or the the charges against them because state law makes
juvenile matters confidential.
   But lawyers for news organizations said a state law barring the
media from publishing the names, addresses and other identifying
information about juveniles is unconstitutional prior restraint
that has been prohibited by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``I would imagine somebody is going to appeal this case,'' said
lawyer Jon Arneson, representing the Argus Leader and KSFY-TV, both
of Sioux Falls. Others involved are The Rapid City Journal,
Aberdeen American News and The Associated Press.
   On Nov. 30, police received a report that four boys had raped a
girl at the mansion on the evening of Nov. 28.
   Gov. George Mickelson and his wife, Linda, were out of town Nov.
28. Their 17-year-old-son, David, is the only other permanent
resident of the mansion. His whereabouts that evening have not been
disclosed.
   Lawyers for the juveniles said court hearings should be closed
because the matter has received undue news coverage.
   An 18-year-old also was charged in connection with the case.
High school student David Ebach was fined $65 last week after
pleading guilty to underage consumption of alcohol on Nov. 28 at
the governor's mansion.

   The Justice Department has decided not to
prosecute Felix Bloch, the American diplomat suspected of spying
for the Soviet Union, according to a broadcast report.
   The department declined to confirm the report Monday night by
ABC News.
   Bloch was the subject of intense FBI surveillance last year
after it was learned he had been videotaped passing a suitcase to a
Soviet agent in Paris.
   Bloch had been the No. 2 official of the U.S. Embassy in Vienna
for much of the Reagan administration before taking up an
assignment in Washington.
   Though he was placed on administrative leave in June, he
continued to draw his $80,000 annual salary.
   The visible agents were withdrawn in December and there were
reports at the time that the Department had all but given up hope
of prosecuting Bloch on an espionage charge.
   What has not been reported is what if any secrets Bloch is
supposed to have given to the Soviet union _ the necessary
ingredient for an espionage prosecution.
   Bloch is said to have been wiretapped telling his wife that he
accepted payments from the Soviets. But such a wiretap might not be
admissible in an American court, analysts have noted.
   David Runkel, spokesman for the Justice Department, said Monday
night he understood that the investigation of Bloch was still
continuing. He also said, ``It is my understanding'' that no
decision had been made one way or another on whether to prosecute
Bloch.

   Approximately 174,000 toy whistles that could
cause children to choke to death are being recalled by their
manufacturer, says the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   The ``Siren Whistle'' toys, manufactured by the Kansas-based
Mitchell Import Co., Inc. were recalled because they easily break
apart into small pieces that can be swallowed by a child, the
agency said Monday.
   The toys consist of a set of six solid-color, 1}-inch whistles.
   Consumers who have the toys, which were sold nationwide from
1988 to 1989, should take them away from children and return them
to the store where they were purchased for a full refund, the
agency said.
   The CPSC said there have been no reports of injuries involving
the toy but the voluntary recall was done as a preventive action.

   Haiti's ambassador to the United States has
resigned to protest what he calls ``repeated violations of human
rights'' by his country's military government.
   Ambassador Pierre Francois Benoit said Monday that the Haitian
government has described itself as provisional but ``in my view is
becoming permanent.''
   In a letter to the nation's military leader, Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril, Benoit said, ``In view of repeated violations of human
rights in our country, which culminated in the events which
transpired this weekend, I cannot continue to serve as your
administration's ambassador to the United States and to the
Organization of American States.''
   He said his decision was triggered primarily by the government's
decision to send several political leaders into exile. He plans to
return to his former employer, General Motors, where he worked
before assuming his duties as ambassador a year ago.

<HEAD>Time Bombs Explode on Eight Trains in Tokyo Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time bombs believed set by leftist radicals
exploded almost simultaneously on eight trains in the Tokyo area
early today, but no injuries were reported, police said.
   A metropolitan police official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the explosions, all small, damaged seats on the
trains.
   He declined to discuss further details, but Kyodo News Service
reported that Japan's best-known radical group, the Chukaku-ha
(Middle Core Faction), claimed responsibility for the explosions.
   Kyodo said that in a statement sent to news media, the group
declared ``unlimited war'' against plans for the formal coronation
of Emperor Akihito in November and for expansion of Tokyo's
international airport.
   The statement called today's bombings ``retaliation against the
reckless act of closing'' one of the huts used as a base by
protesters opposing plans to expand the airport by expropriating
nearby farmland. Police closed the hut one week ago.
   Japan Railway officials said bombings on seven of their trains
affected at least 21,000 people as the company canceled 16 trains
as a precaution. All other trains were delayed by up to 44 minutes,
the officials said.
   In Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo, a small explosion occurred
on a train on the Keisei Electric Railway line, a Keisei official
said.
   On Jan. 8, a projectile landed on the home of the emperor's
younger brother, Prince Hitachi, causing minor damage, and two days
later the Chukaku-ha radical group claimed responsibility for the
attack.
   The radicals oppose Japan's monarchy, while public opinion polls
show a large majority of Japanese supporting it. There is greater
controversy, however, over government plans to spend $56 million on
Akihito's formal coronation.
   Akihito actually became emperor on the death of his father,
Emperor Hirohito, on Jan. 7, 1989.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle, visiting Boston amid
heightened racial tensions, said Republicans can make inroads into
Democratic domination of state politics by being advocates for
civil rights.
   ``We must acknowledge our party failed to provide the leadership
it should have in the civil rights movement of the '60s,'' Quayle
said.
   Quayle started his visit Monday by touring a Catholic school in
the Mission Hill neighborhood where Charles and Carol Stuart, a
white, suburban couple, were shot Oct. 23. He later attended a GOP
fund-raiser where he noted how recent events in Boston have brought
racial issues to the forefront.
   Charles Stuart led police and the public to believe the couple's
assailant was a black mugger. But when Stuart committed suicide
this month, knowing he had been implicated in his wife's murder,
black leaders criticized the city and police for the way the black
community was treated.
   Quayle declined to comment on the specific aspects of the case,
but he told fellow Republicans that the GOP must commit itself to
fighting racial injustice.
   ``We are the party of Lincoln,'' he said. ``We are the party of
equality.''
   Quayle also delved into Massachusetts politics, saying
Republicans have a chance to win this fall's gubernatorial race.
   Gov. Michael Dukakis, a Democrat, is not seeking re-election
this year, and his party has held the office since 1974.
   Among Republicans, former U.S. Attorney William Weld, state
House Minority Leader Steven Pierce and former Rep. Paul Cronin are
vying for the governor's seat. Boston University President John
Silber, Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy and former state Attorney General
Francis Bellotti are seeking the Democratic nomination.

   Above-normal temperatures lingered in most of the nation today.
Light snow fell from the upper Ohio Valley to central New England.

   The Tokyo stock market's leading indicator bobbed
up and down but closed moderately higher today, despite a nosedive
on Wall Street.
   The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected shares closed at
37,378.02, up 121.01 points, or 0.3 percent.
   The Nikkei gyrated wildly through much of the day. After losing
more than 230 points in the first 15 minutes of trading, it ended
the morning session 85 points above Monday's close of 37,257.01. In
afternoon trading, it went above and below Monday's finish
virtually every half-hour.
   In New York on Monday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
fell 77.45 to 2,600.45. It was the New York Stock Exchange's
largest one-day loss since Oct. 13, when the bellwether gauge
plunged 190 points.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 148.38 million
shares, down from 172.26 million in the previous session.
   Today's 121-point rise on the Tokyo stock exchange marked its
third consecutive day of gains, but dealers said trading was thin
and featureless.
   ``The market just continued yesterday's trend,'' said Keiichi
Kamita of Daiwa Securities. ``There was no particular strong
factor.''
   Kamita said buyers sought moderately priced, high-growth issues
in areas such as telecommunications and liquid-crystal technology.
   Until interest rates here and in the United States settle down,
``Japanese investors will go to any vehicle (that offers no)
interest-rate worries,'' he said.
   In general, Kamita said, pending the outcome of parliamentary
elections, expected on Feb. 18, blue-chip stocks will be largely
ignored.
   The dollar closed at 146.33 yen, down 0.09 yen from Monday's
close of 146.42 yen. It opened at 146.66 yen and ranged between
146.20 yen and 146.68 yen. Spot trading volume was $6.91 billion.
   The dollar was simply ``hovering,'' said Masafumi Koyama, chief
dealer in the Bank of Tokyo's foreign exchange division. In the
end, it slipped chiefly because of an unexpected strengthening of
the West German mark, he said.
   Trading will remain calm over the next few days, he predicted,
although if the mark continues to appreciate beyond 1.73 to the
dollar, ``the dollar could stage a comeback ... and break the
147-yen line.''

<TEXT>
   Striking musicians have agreed to a new
contract that virtually eliminates live music in three major
production shows and limits local musicians' work in celebrity
shows.
   The agreement, if ratified by union members, would end a
7{-month strike that disrupted the appearances of big-name
entertainers along the city's glittering Strip while the two sides
were polarized over issues of taped music and guaranteed work.
   The pact allows the resorts to replace 46 live musicians with
taped music in production rooms and eliminates guarantees of work
in celebrity showrooms where local musicians are increasingly being
squeezed out by the use of self-contained bands by many
entertainers.
   ``We've suffered, the hotels have suffered and the town has
suffered,'' Musicians Local 369 president Mark Tully Massagli said.
``There's nothing I know of that would make an eight-month strike
worthwhile.''
   Musicians were expected to approve the pact in a ratification
vote on Wednesday, with some back to work as early as this weekend.
   Hotel officials, who won most of their key initial demands, were
conciliatory in a joint Wednesday night press conference where the
new contract was announced.
   ``These were not just ordinary cost-of-living negotiations,''
said John Giovenco, president of Hilton Nevada Corp. ``We were
dealing with dignified artists being overwhelmed by technological
changes.''
   The four-year contract calls for the 46 musicians who lost their
jobs in production shows at Bally's, the Tropicana and Flamingo
Hilton, to get severance pay of $28,000.
   It also provides for a 5 percent annual wage increase in the
$654 weekly scale paid musicians in addition to health insurance
and pension plan boosts.
   The resorts agreed to hire three musicians and a band leader on
a full-time basis, but are obligated to hire other orchestra
members only on an as-needed basis.
   Hotel negotiator Larry Levien said the hotels still favor
employing local musicians.
   ``We do not and cannot control the acts themselves,'' he said.
``All that we bargained for was our ability to be flexible when we
can't control what the entertainer places upon us.''
   Many entertainers refused to cross picket lines when the strike
began, but some began to trickle back as the strike wore on.
   Wayne Newton, who canceled his first $250,000-a-week engagement
at the Las Vegas Hilton, returned to the stage after unsuccessfully
trying to negotiate an end to the dispute.
   Others, most prominently Frank Sinatra, flatly refused to cross
the lines.

<TEXT>
   Longshoremen at the Port of Baltimore agreed to
return to work today, ending a three-day strike that had led state
officials to consider taking over the facility.
   The 2,000 dockworkers will vote on a contract proposal
Wednesday, said John Bowers, national president of the
International Longshoremen's Association.
   The tentative proposal was reached Monday in New York at a
meeting of ILA officials and negotiators for the Steamship Trade
Association of Baltimore Inc., which represents management at the
port.
   ``Nobody gets everything they want, but we're glad we have an
agreement. We think we can live with it,'' said William J.
Detweiler, president of the Steamship Trade Association.
   The two sides refused to release details of the agreement, but
Local 953 leader Robert P. Hughes said only 65 jobs would be lost
at the port. The local struck at midnight Friday over management
plans that might have cost 150 jobs, Hughes said.
   Dockworkers in Portsmouth and Norfolk, Va., Baltimore's rival
ports, refused Monday to handle cargo diverted from Baltimore's
strike-bound piers, port officials said.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Minister Istvan Horvath
resigned today less than a week after a secret police major accused
the former Communists who are still running the country of spying
on their political opponents.
   The ``Danubegate'' scandal and its political fallout are
jeopardizing the survival of the ruling Socialist Party, which was
formed last year from the ashes of the dissolved Communist Party.
   The party's leaders, who have promised to turn Hungary into a
parliamentary democracy with free multiparty elections set for
March 25, still control the government and with it the national
security apparatus.
   Horvath told Parliament in a speech broadcast live on Hungarian
television that ``dismantling of the old structure is very
complicated.''
   He said that while his ministry was busy reforming the police
force and the border guards, ``reforming the state security
apparatus was left for last.''
   ``If I am guilty,'' Horvath said, ``I am so of not having been
consistent enough in seeing that the changes are implemented.''
   Horvath served as interior minister since 1980 with only one
interruption in 1987.
   The head of the State Security Service's internal department,
Jozsef Horvath, and Ferenc Pallagi, the deputy interior minister
and state security chief, both resigned recently.
   But opposition groups were not satisfied and also called for the
interior minister's resignation.
   On Friday, Maj. Jozsef Vegvari, an officer in the State Security
Service, revealed that he told members of the political opposition
that his agency had been spying on them on orders of the ruling
Socialists.
   The divided opposition groups contend the information obtained
by the spying could give the Socialists a decisive advantage in the
elections.
   The chief prosecutor's office has ordered an inquiry into
political espionage.
   The government disbanded part of the Security Service on Sunday.
It has also sealed all state security documents. Vegvari had
charged that documents had been sent to the shredder.
   Draft legislation is expected next month in Parliament to
curtail Security Service operations.

   Vera English lost her job, car and home
after complaining about safety violations at a nuclear fuel plant,
but the 64-year-old woman said she would do it again.
   ``I feel what is good for our community, for the people, for our
country should come first,'' Mrs. English said. ``I was in a
responsible position, and I took it very seriously.''
   On Monday, Mrs. English got a break when the U.S. Supreme Court
agreed to review her case and decide whether nuclear industry
``whistleblowers'' who say they were disciplined for complaining
about lax safety may sue under state personal injury laws.
   Spokesmen for General Electric, Mrs. English's former employer,
did not immediately return phone calls.
   Mrs. English worked for almost 12 years as a laboratory
technician for GE at its nuclear fuels manufacturing plant in
Wilmington, in southern North Carolina, where she pointed out
violations to management officials and to the federal Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.
   Receiving no response, she deliberately failed to clean up
radiation contamination at her work station to prove the
contamination was not being detected by safety inspectors.
   Although her efforts led to corrective action, she was
disciplined and eventually fired in July 1984.
   Ms. English sued GE in 1987 under North Carolina law, seeking
reinstatement with back pay and damages for wrongful discharge and
infliction of emotional distress.
   But a federal judge, and an appeals court, ruled that she could
file only under the federal Energy Reorganization Act, which does
not provide punitive damages awards.
   Another appeals court has ruled in a separate case that such
state lawsuits can proceed. The Supreme Court decision, to be
announced by July, should clarify the issue.
   It will carry a significant practical effect, since damages
often are the most lucrative part of a successful suit under the
corresponding state laws.
   A medical technologist, Mrs. English was earning between $30,000
and $35,000 a year at the time of her firing. She said she has been
unable to find comparable work because GE publicized her failure to
clean up the contamination.
   ``It destroyed my credibility, my integrity,'' she said.
   A widow with two grown children, Mrs. English has held numerous
low-paying jobs and is now living in someone else's home, caring
for foster children in exchange for room and board.
   ``I had to sell my home to finance my losses,'' she said. ``I
knew the company had more power, money money, more witnesses. I had
to penny pinch.''

   The dollar fell in early European trading today
following a sell-off in earlier trading in the Far East. Gold
prices rose.
   Foreign currency dealers said the dollar was again propelled by
news and rumors out of the Soviet Bloc and by market reactions that
led to breaches of technical support points.
   But they said the dollar's rise Monday was overdone, and that a
strong round of profit-taking was sparked in Tokyo when rumors of
calming tensions in the Soviet Union were received.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar eased 0.09 yen to a closing 146.33 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 146.00 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.7065 West German marks, down from 1.7230
   _1.5195 Swiss francs, down from 1.5325
   _5.8023 French francs, down from 5.8550

   _1,270.25 Italian lire, down from 1,281.50
   _1.1785 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1826
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6440 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6385 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $408.50 a troy ounce, up
from $405.25 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $408.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $409.20, up from $405.75 bid late
Monday.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell 54 cents to close at a bid $407.31.
   Silver rose 6 cents in London to a bid price of $5.26 a troy
ounce.

   Police Chief Donald Grady II dresses
sharply in tailored suits in a farming town where blue jeans and
boots fit the fashion scene. He drives a Porsche on streets where
pickups frequently cruise.
   The 6-foot-5 chief is a staunch law-and-order advocate who
angered residents when he had officers write 285 tickets to
property owners who failed to clear sidewalks of ice after a storm.
He even gave himself a ticket.
   The 36-year-old Grady became Wisconsin's first black police
chief last year, breaking the color barrier in a white,
middle-class town of 3,500 in northwest Wisconsin.
   Now, some of those residents aren't happy, and although they
claim it has nothing to do with race, they are miffed at Grady's
``attitude,'' as car repair show owner Tom Kludt said.
   Folks are used to a more low-key police department in this town
95 miles east of St. Paul, Minn.
   The city council recently disbanded the police commission that
hired Grady, though his critics deny any movement is afoot to get
rid of him.
   Interviewed in his office, Grady said, ``There is no question
about it, there are a few people in this community who would like
to see me disappear.'' ``If they are looking for someone to play
the good ol' boy network, that's not me,'' he said. ``I have chosen
to do good law enforcement, and I am making people unhappy.''
   Grady, who was a sergeant at the Rock County Sheriff's
Department before moving to the eight-person force in Bloomer,
refuses to brand his critics as racists, although he believes race
is an issue.
   ``Unfortunately, you are going to get some ridicule: `He is just
an uppity nigger and just wants to control everything.' I might be
an uppity nigger, but I don't want to control everything, just the
police department,'' he said.
   Mayor Art Stuck said Grady, the town's fourth police chief in 10
years, has done a good job, but residents aren't accustomed to his
style.
   ``There is no doubt he is enforcing the law the way the book
reads,'' the mayor said. ``I think if his own wife made a mistake,
she would get a ticket like anybody else. That is the way it should
be.''
   Grady, who has a masters degree in management and is working
toward a doctorate, hasn't been afraid to pursue criminal offenses,
even ones long accepted as general town practices. For instance:
   _He ordered a gambling raid. Up to that point, gambling at some
businesses was ``just looked at as augmenting one's salary,'' Grady
said. ``Well, the law says you can't gamble.''
   _He exposed an illegal beer cooler in the Fire Department.
``Fireman could go in and pop a quarter or 40 cents, I forget what
it was, into the soda machine and instead of getting a soda he
would get a Miller's,'' Grady said. ``You can't dispense alcohol
without a license. They didn't have one.''
   _He cracked down on speeders. The number of traffic tickets
issued since he took over has tripled, while the number of
accidents has dropped 43 percent, he said. ``That means my wife is
43 percent safer when she goes to the grocery store.''
   The citations in November for slippery sidewalks are already
legend, though none was prosecuted.
   ``The first citation was issued to me. The next group of
citations (13) were issued to the mayor,'' the chief recalled,
shaking his head at the furor that erupted.
   One businessman stormed into the department holding his ticket.
``He said, `What the hell is this?' I showed him my citation,''
Grady said.

   A prominent Panamanian jeweler accused of
conspiring wth Manuel Noriega to smuggle 1.4 million pounds of
marijuana and launder the profits will remain in federal custody
until his trial in April.
   A federal magistrate refused bond Monday for Enrique A. Pretelt,
who is charged with plotting with Noriega to smuggle Colombian
marijuana into the United States during 1983-84.
   ``The defendant has no ties to the United States. He's a pilot,
which is always a concern. And he has apparently substantial
wealth,'' U.S. Magistrate Thomas G. Wilson said at the end of a
40-minute bond hearing. ``All of those factors point to detention.''
   Pretelt pleaded innocent in federal court Thursday to charges
carrying a maximum sentence of 35 years in prison and fines
totaling $265,000.
   He voluntarily surrendered last Wednesday in Panama to face
allegations in a three-count indictment returned Feb. 4, 1988.
   FBI Agent Stan Jacobsen told the court Pretelt was a fugitive
for nearly two years, helped launder drug money through Panamanian
banks, helped disguise a 400,000-pound load of Colombian marijuana
that was to be shipped through Panama and pocketed several thousand
dollars in drug profits.
   Defense attorney George Tragos said the 47-year-old Panamanian
had enough money to afford an apartment and security guards, and
would even agree to be monitored electronically if allowed to
remain free until trial.
   Pretelt is accused of taking bribes from Tampa-based smugglers
to help ferry millions of dollars worth of the illicit drug safely
through Panama.
   While federal officials hope Pretelt will cooperate and
strengthen the case against Noriega, Tragos said his client will go
to trial and fight the charges.
   Meanwhile, in another federal courtroom in Tampa, jury selection
continued in a $32 million money laundering case with links to
Noriega. A 12-member panel was picked Monday. Now opposing
attorneys must decide on six alternates.
   Five former officials with the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International are on trial, including Amjad Awan, who once claimed
to be Noriega's personal banker.
   Two divisions of Luxembourg-based BCCI pleaded guilty last week
to money laundering charges, forfeited a record $14 million and
agreed to cooperate with prosecutors and turn over bank records.

   A federal appeals court upheld the mail-and
tax-fraud conspiracy convictions of fringe presidential candidate
Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., but LaRouche promised to continue his legal
battle.
   A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on
Monday also upheld the convictions of six LaRouche associates in a
case that stemmed from more than $30 million in loans raised by
LaRouche's political supporters.
   ``This is a pure and simple travesty of justice,'' LaRouche,
imprisoned in Rochester, Minn., said through spokeswoman Dana
Scanlon. ``This travesty will be overturned some way eventually.''
   LaRouche was convicted in December 1988 on 11 counts of mail
fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and one count
of conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. He was
sentenced to 15 years in prison.
   Convicted with LaRouche were William Wertz, Edward Spannaus,
Michael Billington, Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg and Joyce
Rubinstein. Wertz and Spannaus were sentenced to five years in
prison and fined $1,000 each. The other four defendants were
sentenced to three years and ordered to pay various fines.
   In arguments last October, former Attorney General Ramsey Clark,
the chief attorney for LaRouche's appeal, said U.S. District Judge
Albert V. Bryan Jr. of Alexandria allowed only 34 days from
arraignment to trial and failed to adequately question jurors on
how much they knew about the defendant.
   But in a unanimous ruling, the appeals judges who heard the case
_ Kenneth K. Hall, Francis D. Murnaghan Jr. and John D. Butzner Jr.
_ rejected claims that the trial was procedurally flawed.
   ``When Judge Bryan denied the defendants' motion for a
continuance, he possessed a highly relevant piece of information:
The defense waited 18 days to move for a continuance,'' the panel
said. ``Defense counsel's prolonged silence leads to the reasonable
inference that 34 days was not a clearly insufficient period of
time between arraignment and trial.''
   The panel also said LaRouche's lawyers made no attempt to press
potential jurors to determine if they had heard of LaRouche, who
ran for president several times and espouses theories of world
conspiracies, including allegations of drug dealing and other
crimes by world leaders.
   According to court records from the trial, the LaRouche
organization used heavyhanded tactics to raise money. LaRouche and
Wertz, who was in charge of fund-raising, set high goals for
individual fund-raisers.
   Fund-raisers began to take loans from potential contributors, as
opposed to donations, the records showed.
   Lenders later were asked to convert their funds into donations,
and one former LaRouche fund-raiser testified that Wertz
characterized lenders who asked for their money back as immoral.
   The government said LaRouche had no intention of repaying the
loans and that he avoided taxes by reporting no income and having
his personal expenses paid through corporations he controlled.

   The government said today that it is
easing its total suspension of visits by Cabinet ministers to China
and will approve them on a case-by-case basis.
   Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans said after a Cabinet
meeting that the policy shift does not signal a return to
``business as usual'' after the bloody Chinese crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement in June.
   Evans said that despite Beijing's lifting of martial law in
Beijing earlier this month, the atmosphere in China had not altered
substantially.
   People arrested for demonstrating are still in jail, reports of
human rights abuses continue and the prevailing conservative
political mood has stalled political and economic reform, he said.
   On the other hand, it is not in the interests of Australia, the
region, or the international community to have an isolated and
inward-looking China, Evans said.
   Regional stability is influenced by China's role in issues such
as ending the war in Cambodia, he said, while the extent of China's
openness to outside economic forces will have crucial influence on
the future of the Asia-Pacific regional economic growth and
integration.
   China also is an important player on issues such as disarmament
and the environment, Evans said, noting that the government has
balanced these various considerations in making its decision on a
resumption of ministerial visits.

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Seeks New Elections To Counter Political Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By C. W. LIM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung today
announced a petition campaign for new elections in an effort to
overcome a setback from the governing party's plans to merge with
centrist opposition groups.
   ``We can see a harsh suppression prepared against democratic
forces, but we are ready to crush any dictatorial regime,'' Kim's
party said in a resolution.
   President Roh Tae-woo said Monday that his conservative
Democratic Justice Party would form an alliance with the two
moderate opposition groups, the Reunification Democratic Party and
New Democratic Republican Party.
   Such a merger will isolate Kim's Party for Peace and Democracy,
the largest opposition group, and limit its chances of gaining
power. Kim describes himself as a liberal centrist, but others say
he is more radical.
   Roh also announced plans to change the government from a
presidential system to a parliamentary one with a prime minister.
   ``We will have to begin a pan-national campaign to make Roh's
government give in,'' Kim told a party caucus today as he announced
the petition drive.
   Governing party officials said a sweeping Cabinet reshuffle was
expected in February to introduce figures from the absorbed
opposition parties and test a fresh political structure before
inaugurating a new party.
   Leaders plan to form the party within six months. It will be the
first time in Korea's history that a new political party is formed
by governing and opposition parties.
   On major campuses in Seoul, students put up wall posters calling
for a civil uprising to overthrow Roh's government and block its
alliance with opposition groups.
   In Kwangju, Kim Dae-jung's hometown, hundreds of students
shouting ``Overthrow Roh Tae-woo!'' fought riot police with
firebombs and rocks on two university campuses. No injuries were
reported.
   At today's party caucus, Kim Dae-jung vowed to collect
signatures of 10 million supporters to push for new elections and
block what his party called a one-party dictatorship.
   The party resolution denounced as a coup the plans for a new
governing party with opposition leaders Kim Young-sam of the
Reunification Party and Kim Jong-pil of the New Democrats.
   It demanded Roh step down if he wants to change the country's
current government system to a parliamentary structure.
   ``We would not reject constitutional changes for a Cabinet
structure if a majority of voters endorsed it,'' the party said.
But it said Roh's government will be responsible for any political
unrest afterward.
   Government party chairman Park Tae-jun told a news conference
today that the issue of adopting a parliamentary system would be
discussed by a 15-member working committee to be formed Wednesday.
   The new party will be assured of a two-thirds majority of the
National Assembly seats, which is needed to revise the constitution.
   The new political alignment boosted the chances of Kim Young-sam
coming to power after Roh steps down in Feburary 1993 after a
single five-year term. Roh defeated him, Kim Dae-jung, and Kim
Jong-pil in the 1987 presidential election. Many Koreans blamed Kim
Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung for splitting the opposition vote at
that time.

<HEAD>City Seeks Record Bond Issue for Quake Repairs</HEAD>

   Officials will ask voters to approve the
biggest bond issue in city history, $332.4 million, for repairing
buildings and pipelines damaged by the Oct. 17 earthquake.
   The bond measure will go to voters in June, Rudy Nothenberg, the
city's chief administrative officer, said Monday.
   He said $102.9 million would be used to restore City Hall and
scores of other buildings to their pre-earthquake conditions, and
another $106.4 million for structural reinforcement of City Hall
and the building that houses the Health Department.
   An additional $97 million would go for seismic safety
improvements to 18 other buildings _ the Opera House, Veterans
Building, Civic Auditorium, Exploratorium, two police stations, two
city jails and 10 branch libraries.
   The remaining $26 million would be used to repair sewage, water
and electric lines, Nothenberg said.
   The repairs would force the Opera House to close during the 1995
season, but City Hall could remain open, he said.
   Mayor Art Agnos, meanwhile, announced Monday that the Federal
Emergency Management Agency has agreed to reimburse the city $3.2
million for emergency-response costs for the 10 days after the
quake, including overtime and regular salaries for police officers,
firefighters and health and social workers.
   The reimbursement ``appears to be an expression of confidence in
our arithmetic,'' Agnos said.
   The 7.1-magnitude quake killed 67 people and caused an estimated
$7 billion damage in Northern California.

   A judge sentenced a man who sexually
abused a girl to a 30- to 60-year jail term and recommended he not
be granted early release unless he is castrated or medically
treated to eliminate his sex drive.
   Common Pleas President Judge Gilfert M. Mihalich acknowledged
Monday that his sentence for Samuel Elbert Powell, 42, might not be
binding.
   But Mihalich said he was trying to encourage legislators to
consider making castration a legal punishment in some cases.
   ``I'm trying to tell the Legislature to eliminate the menace,''
the judge said. ``Incarceration alone is not the remedy for the
menace caused by sexual urges. If you eliminate that sexual urge, I
think it eliminates the menace.''
   Powell was charged with committing 25 criminal acts against the
girl, now 9 years old, from 1986 to 1988. He pleaded guilty to 23
counts.
   He has been charged with sexual crimes in several states in the
past, starting when he was 16, and has served more than five years
in prison for sex crimes and burglary.
   Assistant District Attorney Rita Hathaway said she did not
anticipate the recommendation regarding castration.
   But, she added, ``I'm all for it.''

<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry's arrest last week on a
cocaine charge has dealt a setback to the uphill fight to win
statehood for the District of Columbia, says a congressman.
   But the non-voting delegate to Congress for the past 19 years
said he believes ``every cloud has a silver lining'' and Barry's
arrest may work in the district's favor.
   Rep. Stan Parris of Virginia, a Republican on the House
Appropriations subcommittee on the District of Columbia and a
longtime critic of the district government, said the mayor's arrest
``cannot be beneficial to the statehood advocates. ... clearly this
sets that back.''
   ``Members of Congress who would use a man who admittedly has a
problem (as a reason for opposing D.C. statehood) no longer have
that excuse,'' Delegate Walter Fauntroy said in a telephone
interview Monday.
   The delegate said lawmakers will return to Washington today
praising emerging democracies in Poland, Romania and Panama, and be
hard-pressed to explain why 650,000 citizens in the district are
without representation.
   Congress granted home rule for the district in 1974. Under that
system, the city's 670,000 residents have the right to elect a
mayor and city council, but do not have a vote in Congress.
   The city budget is approved by Congress and lawmakers can veto
laws enacted by the city council.
   But after granting home rule, Congress took some of it back in
1988. Overriding the city council, Congress voted to require the
city to stop using Medicaid money to pay for abortions, to allow
Georgetown University to deny facilities to homosexual campus
groups and to compel the city to repeal a law barring mandatory
AIDS tests by applicants for life insurance.
   ``There is not an organized crescendo'' (against home rule),
said Parris. ``There is an increased discussion about whether this
thing is really working. There's a growing perception among the
members of Congress who live here.''
   Fauntroy and city administrator Carol Thompson, who has assumed
most of the governmental powers of mayor since Barry's arrest, met
with the House and Senate leadership Monday.
   ``We wanted to assure leaders of the House and Senate just as
members of the council and others in the city have been assured
that the government is in good hands, that indeed the ability now
is to focus attention exclusively and primarily on delivery of
services,'' Fauntroy told reporters.

   Former Mayor Frank Rizzo wanted Sylvester
Stallone on his radio show, so an on-air phone call seemed the next
best thing to interviewing the ``Rocky'' star in person.
   It also turned out to be the next best thing to actually talking
with Stallone, because the caller was an impostor.
   ``He really sounded like Stallone,'' Rizzo said of Dennis
Malloy, WSNI-FM disc jockey.
   Rizzo, whose program is on WCAU-AM, had reason to expect a call
from Stallone because the mayor had seen the actor at dinner and
asked him to go on the program.
   On Friday, two days later, the mayor got the call, but from
Malloy. Rizzo spent six minutes asking him about ``Rocky V,'' which
is being filmed in Philadelphia.
   Asked about the call later, Malloy said, ``It was a quiet
afternoon. ... I'd lost my street hockey ball. ... It was too cold
to play golf. ... Nobody was using the phone.''
   Rizzo wasn't bothered by the hoax. ``I enjoyed it,'' he said.

   A group of relieved Polish sailors came
home today, 19 days after they were captured by Ethiopian
guerrillas and led on a harrowing trek through caves, desert
hideouts and mountain ravines.
   The sailors were reportedly captured because the rebels believed
their vessel was carrying arms to Ethiopia's Marxist government.
   Polish news accounts indicated today that the ship at one point
carried weapons for South Yemen, and acknowledged that Poland has
indeed shipped arms to Ethiopia.
   The sailors said that after their vessel was riddled by gunfire
on the Red Sea, they were captured and led on a 600-mile journey.
   ``Afterwards, the guerrillas admitted that it was a mistake.
They apologized to us,'' Capt. Andrzej Sikorski told the official
Polish news agency PAP.
   His freighter, the 8,137-ton Boleslaw Krzywousty, was attacked
Jan. 3 as it steamed from Port Sudan to Massawa, a Red Sea port in
Eritrea.
   The director of the Polish Ocean Lines told the sailors'
families the ship carried no arms when it was attacked but had
unloaded Polish ``hunting weapons and ammunition'' in South Yemen
after legally registering the cargo at each port, according to a
Jan. 15 report in the Sztandar Mlodych newspaper.
   However, the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper reported today that arms
shipments for Ethiopia had been loaded as recently as Jan. 12 onto
an Ethiopian plane at the Warsaw airport.
   Poland has sold Ethiopia arms worth $8.3 million during the last
two years, according to an official from the Foreign Trade
Ministry's Central Board of Engineers quoted by the newspaper.
   Representatives of the Polish government and U.S. diplomats
arranged the Monday release of the 28 crewmen, the ship's doctor
and the captain's wife.
   ``I'm still alive'' shouted Dr. Krystyna Dabrowska as the crew
emerged from a chartered plane that landed early today at the
Baltic port of Gdansk.
   According to accounts published by PAP and Polish newspapers,
the freighter was attacked by rebels firing machine guns from three
motorboats.
   The assault ``turned the right side of the ship into a sieve,''
Sikorski said.
   The rebels, who have been fighting almost three decades to free
their northern Eritrea province from Ethiopia, acknowledged the
attack through a spokesman speaking anonymously from Bahrain Jan. 7.
   As the crew took cover on deck, a fire broke out below, Sikorski
said. There were no injuries, however.
   The assault continued for two hours, despite a white flag raised
by the crew and appeals for the attackers to cease fire made
through a loud speaker, the captain said.
   ``We could not make any contact with them during the attack.
They simply showed no reaction to our signals,'' he said.
   When the firing did cease, the crew was ordered onto the
motorboats. As they reached shore, they heard explosions aboard the
ship.
   The first two weeks the crew was held captive were spent in very
difficult conditions, the reports said.
   The rebels, fearing an Ethiopian government attack, moved the
prisoners only at night, sometimes by car and at other times on
foot.
   ``During 19 days, we changed our position five times. We stayed
in ravines, caverns, in the desert,'' said Sikorski.
   The last week was spent at a medical base, where the sailors
said they were given beds and larger portions of food than the
guerrillas received.
   The Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper said it withheld information about
the arms shipments while the sailors were in captivity, and
reported that government officials had suspended two additional
shipments for the Ethiopian order totaling $2.3 million.
   ``It is true that we should have turned the (Ethiopian) plane
back but we can't afford that and we can't stop the business,''
said the engineering board official identified by the newspaper as
Director Pawluczuk.
   An unidenfied Foreign Ministry official was quoted in the
newspaper saying trade in arms, no longer needed by Poland's army
as weapons levels are reduced, is a lucrative source of income for
the beleagured Polish economy.
   ``We are disarming ourselves,'' the official said. ``The arms we
sell cannot be taken advantage of in the civil economy and
therefore we have the problem off our hands and proper payment.''
   According to the newspaper, Polish ships carry not only
Polish-made arms but shipments from other nations loaded at Western
European ports in sealed containers without labels identifying the
cargo.

   Iranian lawmakers today warned Moscow not
to be influenced by ``American conspiracies'' as the Soviets seek
to stop ethnic violence in the republic of Azerbaijan, Tehran radio
said.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said the warning was
contained in a letter to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
signed by 160 deputies in the 270-seat parliament.
   More than 170 people have died since last week in ethnic
violence between the republic's Azerbaijani majority and Armenians,
according to official Soviet reports.
   Gorbachev declared a state of emergency in Azerbaijan and Red
Army troops stormed the Azerbaijani capital of Baku on Saturday to
quell the fighting.
   Thousands of Soviet Azerbaijanis, who are bound by a common
language, culture and religion with their Iranian kin across the
border, poured into Iran during last week's violence.
   Tehran television reported Monday that Soviet troops had sealed
the border to prevent further crossings.
   The letter by the Iranian lawmakers urged Gorbachev ``not to be
influenced by the conspiracies of global arrogance and the criminal
America, and to deal with the Moslems of the Soviet Union with
compassion.''
   ``Global arrogance'' is a term used to refer to the West.
   The Iranian Foreign Ministry issued a statement Sunday that
warned Moscow that ``imperialist governments and the
Zionist-controlled media'' were distorting what was happening in
Azerbaijan, portraying the Moslem Azerbaijanis as belligerents
attacking helpless Armenians.
   The parliament's letter said: ``The Moslems of Soviet
Azerbaijan, by protesting in their cities and gathering on the
Iranian border ... are demonstrating their desire to return to the
fold of Islam, and regain their lost identitity.''
   The letter called on Gorbachev to defuse the situation
peacefully.
   Moscow has long feared that Iran's revolutionary zealots, who
came to power in 1979, would seek to export their brand of Islam to
the 70 million Moslems who live in the Soviet Union's southern
republics.
   Soviet media have accused Iran of supplying arms to the Moslems
in Azerbaijan, a claim denied by Iran.
   The mass border crossings have heightened fears in Tehran that
nationalistic passions among its own 15 million Azerbaijanis could
be aroused.
   Soviet nationalists want to establish an independent homeland
for the 20 million Azerbaijanis on both sides of the border.
   The Azerbaijanis lived together under Persian rule until 1828,
when part of their homeland was ceded to Czarist Russia.
   The violence between the Soviet republic's mostly Moslem
Azerbaijanis and Christian Armenians erupted Jan. 13 when a
historical feud flared over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
The predominantly Armenian enclave has been part of Azerbaijan
since 1923.

   When Richard A. Stahl's wife of 46 years
died, his buddy for more than a half century, Warren Goodnow, was
there to help him through the grief.
   Stahl, 71, was so grateful he told Goodnow that he arranged to
leave him everything he owned when he died _ including $70,000 from
the sale of his house.
   But now he says Goodnow took the money too soon, and stole his
car as well.
   Goodnow, 70, was arraigned Monday in Warwick on charges of
larceny and auto theft and was jailed on $50,000 bail.
   Stahl says Goodnow suggested that rather than go to a lawyer to
draw up a will, Stahl deposit the $70,000 in a joint account. Stahl
says Goodnow then ran off to Florida in September with the money
and the Cadillac he bought after his wife's death last year.
   Goodnow, who had been friends with Stahl since they met in high
school in 1935, contends he took the $70,000 from the joint account
to prevent Stahl from spending it.
   Coventry police Capt. Walter P. Hennessy, who flew to Florida
two weeks ago to drive the Cadillac back, said $50,000 was returned
to Stahl.
   Stahl, who lives in a trailer, said he was so broke volunteers
had to bring him meals to get him through Thanksgiving and
Christmas.
   His trust in others has been ``shattered,'' Stahl said. ``I feel
hurt.''
   ``I think I could forgive him if he asked for it,'' he said,
``but I don't think he will.''

<TEXT>
   Only 18 seconds before liftoff, space
officials today postponed a rocket launch that would have made
Japan only the third country to send a spacecraft around the moon.
   Officials said the flight was canceled after a problem arose in
the hydraulic control system used to move the nozzle of a booster
rocket.
   ``I don't think it is a serious problem,'' mission chief Hiroki
Matsuo said. ``If things go well, there is still a chance of a
launch tomorrow.''
   The mission received little advance publicity in Japan and
today's countdown was not shown live on television.
   Dozens of reporters had gathered on a dark hillside several
miles from the oceanside launch site to watch the liftoff. But
officials stopped the countdown with only 18 seconds to go.
   If the mission goes as planned, the ``Muses-A'' would be the
first spacecraft to orbit the moon since the Soviet Union landed
the unmanned vehicle Luna 24 on its surface in 1976. On July 20,
1969, Americans Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin became the first
astronauts to set foot on the moon.
   The Japanese hope to use the mission to develop techniques for
an eventual manned lunar flight and exploration of other planets,
said Kuninori Uesugi, an official with the Institute of Space and
Astronautical Science.
   Japan's emergence as a possible lunar power comes after a late
start in space, but a series of launch successes has led to worry
overseas that Japan could develop an aerospace industry rivaling
other nations in the lucrative commercial business of
communications satellites.
   The institute plans to send the Muses-A into a highly oval Earth
orbit that will bring it about 10,000 miles from the moon on March
18.
   Japanese space centers cannot trace the flight all the way, so
centers in Canberra, Australia, and at the California Institute of
Technology will help, said center spokesman Tadashige Takiya.
   Just before crossing the moon's orbit, the craft is to release a
smaller satellite equipped with a ``kick motor'' that will propel
it into its own lunar orbit.
   The smaller craft will send data to the mother satellite on
space temperatures and electric fields. The larger craft,
meanwhile, will continue circling Earth, swinging by the moon, and
collecting data on space dust and other phenomena.
   The government-funded flight will be the 13th satellite launched
by Japan and the fifth use of Nissan Motor Co.'s M3S-2 rocket, a
three-stage, solid-fuel rocket that weighs 62 tons. Japan launched
its first experimental satellite in 1970.
   Nissan, Japan's second-largest automobile maker, opened its
aerospace division in 1953 and has since played a key role in
developing and manufacturing Japan's solid-fuel rocket engines.
   Rocket launches in Japan have a high success rate, but the
National Space Development Agency had its first failure in 20
launchings in August when the first stage of an H-1 rocket failed
to ignite.
   Launches are limited to a 90-day period each year _ 45 days in
August and 45 in January and February _ because tuna fishermen near
the space center, off the southern main island of Kyushu, complain
the liftoffs are dangerous.
   The Space Development Agency and the space institute, which is
affiliated with the Education Ministry, share control of Japan's
space program.

<HEAD>Premier Calls For ``Earliest Possible'' Withdrawal of Soviet
Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Miklos Nemeth called today for
the ``earliest possible'' withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary.
   ``I have spoken with Premier (Nikolai) Ryzhkov twice in recent
weeks and we agreed that the (existing) basis for the stationing of
Soviet troops on Hungarian soil has outlived itself,'' Nemeth told
Parliament.
   ``There are neither military nor political reason for their
being here,'' Nemeth said.
   He said Hungarian armed forces are ``fully capable of defending
the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country.''
   At an East-West military forum in Vienna, Ferenc Somogyi, state
secretary of the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, said on Jan. 18 that
Hungary demands a quick withdrawal of the Red Army contingent,
explaining Hungary wants the troops out this year or next year at
the latest.
   Nemeth told the House that Hungarian and Soviet experts would
meet in Budapest ``in the next few days'' and the ``withdrawal
schedule will be determined by the technically necessary time for
the withdrawal and for the Hungarian armed forces's capacity to
meet the new situation.''
   ``The international situation is favorable and our image of the
enemy has changed,'' Nemeth said.
   Concerning the Vienna talks between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, he
said that Hungary ``intends to play a positive role and contribute
to its success.''
   There are still some 52,000 Soviet troops in Hungary. Troop
withdrawals began in April l989 and 10,000 left in the course of
that year.
   Hungary and other Soviet bloc nations shed their orthodox
Communist governments this year and are seeking closer economic and
political ties to the West. Hungary has promised free elections
this year.

   Cartoonist Charles Schulz drew lofty praise from
the keepers of French culture today as they lavishly celebrated the
40th birthday of America's favorite floppy-eared dog, the
irrepressible Snoopy.
   The beagle was glorified with a giant retrospective at the
Decorative Arts Museum. French Culture Minister Jack Lang named
Schulz a ``commander of arts and letters,'' one of France's highest
awards for excellence in the arts.
   ``Thank you for being the creator of Snoopy, full of humor and
with a zest for life,'' Lang told Schulz. ``Your character is both
mythical and hedonistic and he has taken over our collective
consciousness and become a part of our everyday lives.''
   Schulz, 67, beaming but appearing slightly embarrassed by all
the fuss, said when Snoopy was a World War I flying ace, he asked
him how he learned to speak French.
   ``He said he had a small tourist phrase book but he told me you
only really need to know one word, and that is, Merci,'' Schulz
said in English.
   Eve Dutton, director of special events at Determined
Productions, a sponsor of the exhibit, said Schulz was ``shocked''
when asked to participate in the show.
   ``He considers himself a simple cartoonist, not a great artist
worthy of a show at the Louvre. He just couldn't believe it,'' she
said.
   The Decorative Arts Museum is in the northern wing of the Louvre
palace, but it is not actually part of the main museum.
   The show opens to the public Wednesday and runs through April
22, and it is sure to please Snoopy lovers of all ages.
   Created in 1950, the dog combines fun and fantasy, wit and even
sarcasm when dealing with Charlie Brown, Lucy and the other
characters in the Peanuts comic strip.
   The highlight of the exhibit, the first of its kind anywhere in
the world, are the 300 stuffed Snoopies and Belles _ his sister _
dressed by the world's leading fashion designers, including Chanel,
Christian Lacroix, Hermes and Georgio Armani.
   Youngsters are invited to design their own outfit for Snoopy,
and the winner will receive a giant stuffed beagle.
   Original Peanuts drawings in the show came from Shultz's vault
in Santa Rosa, Calif.
   The space capsule was named Charlie Brown and the lunar module _
which did not land on the moon on that mission _ was called Snoopy.
   After Paris, the show will travel to Japan's Mitsukoshi
department store in Toyko and the Los Angeles Country Museum of
Natural History.

<HEAD>Report: Astronomer Fabricated Data</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scholar says Johannes Kepler, the father of
modern astronomy, fabricated data to support his theory of how the
planets move around the sun.
   The New York Times reported today that Kepler apparently
resorted to scientific fakery to bolster acceptance of his theory,
which turned out to be valid.
   William H. Donahue, a science historian who lives in Santa Fe,
N.M., said in an article in the Journal of the History of Astronomy
that the evidence of Kepler's deceit is contained in an elaborate
chart Kepler created in 1609.
   Kepler showed that planets move in elliptical orbits, rather
than circles. In his book on the subject, he wrote that his
conclusion was confirmed by independent calculations of the
planets' positions.
   In fact, Donahue said, Kepler derived the data based by
calculations based on the theory itself.
   Donahue said he made the discovery while translating Kepler's
master work, ``Astronomia Nova,'' into English.
   Several experts have defended Kepler, arguing that standards of
scientific research and reporting have changed over the past 400
years.
   ``Kepler was one of the people who invented modern science,''
said Walter W. Stewart, a researcher with the National Institutes
of Health. ``It's not clear his standards were the same as ours.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The military government tightened
restrictions on the media today by barring radio stations from
carrying foreign news about Haiti or broadcasting reports ``likely
to incite agitation.''
   The announcement came two days after Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril's
government announced a state of siege. It followed reported raids
on three independent radio stations and a weekend of arrests,
beatings, and deportations of leaders of the democratic opposition.
   An Information Ministry communique ordered radio and TV stations
to ``refrain from relaying or broadcasting any information on Haiti
from stations broadcasting outside of the national territory.'' It
also said the stations should refrain from broadcasting anything
``likely to incite agitation.''
   In recent days, local stations have relayed statements by exiled
opposition leaders broadcast by Radio France Internationale and the
Voice of America. Radio is the main source of news in Haiti.
   The military government has insisted restrictions on civil
liberties were needed to maintain order, but opponents say the
moves are intended to silence critics and prolong its rule.
   The Information Ministry also told radio stations to check with
it to confirm the ``exactness'' of any local news reports before
broadcasting them. The communique also requires provincial news
reports be pre-recorded rather than live.
   Raymond Exume, news director of the Protestant church-run Radio
Lumiere, said he was ``astonished'' by the communique. He said the
station would stop giving local news. Radio Soleil, run by the
Roman Catholic church, also said it would cease broadcasting local
news.
   In Washington, Haiti's ambassador to the United States, Pierre
Francois Benoit, resigned Monday to protest the ``repeated
violations of human rights'' by Haiti's government.
   Benoit, a proponent of democratic reform, told a news conference
that the 16-month-old regime in Haiti, which has described itself
as provisional, ``in my view is becoming permanent.''
   Avril's government declared a 30-day state of siege and began
expelling prominent political leaders on Saturday, one day after
unidentified attackers killed an army colonel.
   Dozens of government critics also were reported arrested, but
most were thought to have been released.
   It is the government's toughest crackdown on its critics since
coming to power in a September 1988 soldier's revolt. Critics
accuse Avril of using the colonel's killing as a pretext to assume
dictatorial powers and renege on his pledge to cede power to a
civilian government after free elections in October.
   Avril claimed the curbs on civil liberties were necessary ``to
protect democratic accomplishments against terrorism.''
   State-run television and radio reported international
condemnation of the government's action, but said the state of
siege and expulsions were justified by ``destabilizing activities''
by the political opposition.
   The Bush administration said it ``deplores the actions taken by
the government of Haiti.'' France and Canada issued similar
protests.
   This impoverished Caribbean nation of 5 million people has been
ruled almost exclusively by dictators since winning independence
from France in 1804.
   After Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier was forced into exile in
France in February 1986 by a popular uprising, ending a
three-decade family reign, there was hope among Haitians that
democracy might actually be on the horizon.
   Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who then took over, presided over
November 1987 elections that were canceled after thugs in collusion
with the army massacred at least 34 people at polling stations.
   Namphy was overthrown in the revolt Avril rode into power.
Noncommissioned officers who led the coup claimed they ousted
Namphy because they were outraged by state-sponsored murder and
political repression.
   Under its state of siege, the government also suspended a law
forbidding forced exile and renewed an entry visa requirement for
Haitians returning from abroad.
   The government has acknowledged the expulsions of three
prominent activists _ Dr. Louis Roy, principal author of the 1987
constitution; conservative leader Hubert de Ronceray; and Max
Bourjolly, deputy leader of the Communist Party.

   Communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas are
preventing Cambodian refugees from going to a U.N. camp and instead
are moving them toward an area that has been a combat zone, U.N.
officials said today.
   Also today, a Thai military spokesman said Cambodian guerrillas
have cut parts of important government supply lines from the
Cambodian interior to battlefields in the west.
   The sound of gunfire crackled in the isolated Borai camp shortly
after U.N. trucks arrived there Monday to take refugees to the Site
K camp, said Patrick Van de Velde, deputy director of the U.N.
Border Relief Operation.
   The 10 trucks remained outside Borai today, and repeated
shooting appeared designed to stop the refugees from leaving, said
another relief official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Borai, run by the Khmer Rouge, is near Thailand's eastern
province of Trat and a few miles from Site K.
   None of the Borai refugees had boarded the trucks by today,
although some refugees in the past have pressed relief officials to
be transferred to Site K.
   ``They are too scared to leave,'' said another aid official,
also speaking anonymously.
   There was no statement from the Khmer Rouge.
   He said camp authorities had ordered the refugees to head toward
areas along the Cambodian frontier recently secured by the
guerrillas. Since Jan. 15, the Khmer Rouge have moved about
three-fourths of 4,000 to 4,500 people at Borai to the border area,
the aid official said.
   Urs Boegli, head of the Thailand office of the International
Committee of the Red Cross, said: ``The danger is they are being
moved toward a combat zone.''
   The Khmer Rouge is the largest guerrilla group fighting the
Vietnamese-installed government in Cambodia.
   During a 3{-year rule that was ended by Vietnam's invasion in
late 1978, the Communist fanatics slaughtered hundreds of thousands
of people in an attempt to radically restructure Cambodian society.
   The guerrillas took tens of thousands of civilians along as they
retreated to the Thai border in 1979, and widespread human rights
violations have been reported in its civilian camps.
   The Khmer Rouge have resisted moving refugees to U.N.-aided
camps for fear of losing control over them. But amid mounting
international pressure, the guerrillas in the past year have let
nearly 30,000 refugees from secretive military-run camps resettle
in two U.N. camps, O'trao and Site K.
   This had raised hopes for transferring the people from Borai,
the most hard-line of four Khmer Rouge camps where the United
Nations has had access.
   Just last week, after months of negotiations, Borai
administrator Lok Tia assured a U.N. official the refugees could
freely decided whether to go to Site K.
   A coalition of three guerrilla factions is fighting Cambodia's
Vietnamese-installed government.
   The coalition _ including the Khmer Rouge and the non-communist
forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front _ has made major gains since late September, when
Vietnam withdrew what it said were its last troops in Cambodia.
   At a press briefing in Bangkok today, Thai military spokesman
Rear Adm. Kraichit Sirisombat confirmed guerrilla claims they cut
parts of Route 5 and Route 6, which run the length of Cambodia to
the western border with Thailand.
   Government forces now were concentrating on securing the most
important cities, he said.

   CIA Director William Webster said today that
the Soviet threat to the United States and its NATO allies has
diminished as a result of the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe.
   In an unusual public appearance before Congress, Webster said
the Soviet Union continues to modernize its strategic forces with
deployment last year of land-based, nuclear missiles and the
launching of ballistic missile submarines.
   However, he told the Senate Armed Services Committee, ``the
conventional threat to the United States and our alliance partners
in Europe has decreased as a result of changes in Eastern Europe
and Soviet force reductions.''
   The result of these reductions is that the length of time it
would take the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact nations to mobilize
any large-scale attack in Europe has increased, Webster said.
   ``Moscow is not likely to be confident, therefore, of Eastern
European readiness to respond to Soviet requirements,'' he said.
   In addition, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, faced with
economic pressures at home and the growing demands of
nationalities, will be forced to reduce defense spending, he added.
   ``We can probably expect a continued diminution _ but not
elimination _ of Soviet threats to U.S. interests,'' Webster said
in his opening statement. A question-and-answer period with members
of the Armed Services Committee was closed to the public and news
media.
   The hearing marked the first in a series of sessions the
committee has scheduled to assess the Soviet threat and use the
information as a basis for crafting a defense budget for the fiscal
year that begins Oct. 1.
   President Bush will send his budget proposal to Congress next
Monday.
   ``We've seen the threat change on TV every night,'' Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the committee, said in beginning the
hearing. ``We'll be looking at this changed threat as the
foundation on which we build the budget which we will be asking the
American people to pay for.''
   Sen. James Exon of Nebraska, the second-ranking Democrat on the
panel, stressed the importance of the threat assessment hearings,
and said the worst thing the panel could do would be to approach
the budget with ``a machete type of approach.''
   One budget issue sure to attract controversy is the B-2 stealth
bomber, the Air Force's costly plane designed to evade Soviet radar
detection. In the opening shots over the B-2, Republican Sen.
William Cohen of Maine expressed his opposition to the aircraft if
it means crippling the Air Force budget.
   But another Republican, Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington, said
there may be an even greater need for the B-2, which has come under
attack for its price of about $530 million a copy.
   ``Already we've identified one debate,'' Nunn said. ``They'll be
many more to follow.''

   Civic duty called early in the morning for

duty.
   County police set out at 4:30 a.m. Monday to round up some of 34
reluctant jurors facing bench warrants, said Undersheriff Armando
Fontoura.
   ``We brought them down and they all went before the judge.
They've all been fined $50,'' Fontoura said.
   Some were arrested because they failed to pay previous fines for
ignoring summonses to jury duty, said Cathy Panico, the county's
assistant jury manager.
   This time they must pay by Friday or face contempt of court
charges, she said.
   The reluctant jurors' names have been put back into the pool for
the next court session, in July.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Promised a share of power by the ruling
Communists, East Germany's inexperienced opposition groups failed
to agree today on whether to join the government they eventually
hope to replace.
   A leader of the opposition Social Democrats conceded that
informal discussions among the numerous pro-democracy groups has
yet to yield a common strategy on how closely the opposition should
work with the rival Communists.
   Meanwhile, East German border guards worked through the night
dismantling a 325-yard stretch of the Berlin Wall. They planned to
replace the section with a simple metal fence.
   Communist Premier Hans Modrow offered Monday to rebuild his
Cabinet to include opposition forces such as the Social Democrats
and New Forum, the largest of the reform movements challenging the
Communists.
   Modrow called for talks Wednesday to determine which ministerial
posts could be filled by reform activists, and Social Democrat
leader Ibrahim Boehme agreed that swift and united action was
needed to avert collapse of the East German economy.
   But Ingrid Koeppe, a prominent New Forum activist, said the
opposition needed time to consult with grass-roots activists and to
coordinate positions of the different groups. She told The
Associated Press she did not know when negotiations on an
opposition role in the leadership could begin.
   Ulrich Kasparech, business manager of the Social Democrats, also
said further talks among the fractious new political groups are
needed.
   ``There is no consensus yet,'' Kasparech told The AP. ``This
will depend on the groups being able to come to agreement, and they
have no further meetings set at this time.''
   Pro-democracy protests late last year toppled the old Stalinist
regime, which was replaced by reform-oriented Communists. The new
regime has promised free and open elections on May 6.
   But the opposition, which hopes to handily defeat the Communists
in the balloting, has been split sharply over strategy and
direction.
   Kasparech said other reform advocates met with Boehme earlier
but that the groups currently disagree about the share of Cabinet
seats they should seek.
   Boehme, in an interview today with the Communist Party daily
Neues Deutschland, appealed to West German Social Democrats to
provide immediate aid to East Germany to halt the exodus of workers
fearing no change in their spartan lifestyles can be expected soon.
   Nearly 2,000 East Germans per day have been fleeing to West
Germany, a sign of dwindling hope for an East German recovery.
   Communists currently hold 16 ministerial posts in Modrow's
27-member Cabinet, with Liberal Democrats in four, Christian
Democrats with three, and two each for the National Democrats and
the farmers' party.
   The non-Communist Cabinet members are from officially recognized
parties once aligned with the Communists.
   Since the Communists were stripped in December of their
constitutional guarantee of a leading role, reform groups have
argued that Modrow's government lacks a political mandate and
therefore is a transitional force with limited powers.
   Until Monday, the groups had resisted formally joining Modrow's
government, partly from fear they would share the blame for the
economic mess left by 40 years of monopoly communism.
   Since setting the election date in December, the regular talks
between the Communists and the opposition have been mired in
procedural squabbles and infighting.
   In West Berlin, several hundred gathered along crowd control
barriers lined up along the graffiti-splattered Berlin Wall to
watch East German border guards begin dismantling the hated
barrier. It is to be replaced this week by a fence.
   West Berlin government spokesman Werner Kolhoff said he was
informed by East Berlin officials that other segments of the wall
would be removed later.
   The wall was symbolically breached on Nov. 9, when East Germany
scrapped travel restrictions on its citizens and began opening new
border crossings to West Germany.

   Moslem militants in Kashmir today ordered
people to stop paying taxes to India, and police said at least two
more people were killed in clashes between the Moslems and
government forces.
   The new casualties brought the total to at least 50 killed and
about 400 wounded since troops opened fire Saturday on protesters
violating a round-the-clock curfew in this northern city.
Authorities relaxed the curfew today.
   India repeated its charges that neighboring Pakistan was
involved in the agitation. Pakistan denied the accusation.
   Loudspeakers at mosques blared ``Victory is ours!'' and urged
people to stop paying taxes. The Kashmiri-language broadcasts were
audible over much of the city and were repeated regularly.
   Police said at least two people were killed when security
guards, traveling in a vehicle that was following a U.N. car,
opened fire at a crowd of about 300 people in a Srinagar suburb.
   Capt. Idesbald Van Diesebroeck of the U.N. Military Observers
Group in India and Pakistan said the mob stopped the two cars and
someone in the crowd threw a clay pot containing hot coals at the
guards' vehicle.
   Many Kashmiris tie the pots to their bodies to keep warm during
winter.
   ``The pot hit the eye of one of the guards and the others
apparently thought it was an attack so they fired back,'' Van
Diesebroeck said.
   Witnesses speaking on condition of anonymity said they counted
at least four bodies after the shooting.
   U.N. observers are posted in the state to monitor a cease-fire
line that divides Kashmir into Indian and Pakistani sectors.
   The incident came after authorities relaxed the curfew for four
hours today, permitting people to venture from their homes.
   In New Delhi, the government expressed concern at what it called
evidence of Pakistan's involvement in the agitation.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Aftab Seth said the concern was
conveyed to Pakistan Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan during
his three-day visit to New Delhi.
   The Pakistani Embassy issued a statement saying Khan ``rejected
the allegation of interference on the part of Pakistan, pointing
out that the current turmoil in the Kashmir valley was purely
indigenous and resulted from the denial of self-determination to
the people of Kashmir.''
   The protesters want their region to secede from predominantly
Hindu India and declare its independence or join Moslem-dominated
Pakistan.
   Moslem militants, led by the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front,
have been attacking government buildings and patrols to press their
demands.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Indian state with a Moslem majority.
About 64 percent of the state's 5 million people are Moslems, but
nationwide Moslems comprise only 12 percent of India's 880 million
people.
   The old princely state of Kashmir was divided between India and
Pakistan when the two countries were partitioned and became
independent from Britain in 1947. The two nations have fought three
wars since then, two of them over Kashmir.

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. James Florio immediately set to work
on a campaign promise and unveiled a plan to bring down auto
insurance rates, which are among the nation's highest at an average
of $1,000 a year per car.
   ``Our car insurance system is a disgrace,'' Florio said Monday.
``It costs drivers too much. It's too generous to insurance
companies. It's unfair. As we describe a car wrecked beyond repair,
our system of insurance is totaled. And we might as well scrap it.''
   Florio, a Democrat who took office last week, said his reforms
that would save motorists an average of $225, the average per-car
surcharge motorists pay to support the Joint Underwriting
Association, in which insurance companies pool the cost of insuring
high-risk drivers.
   Florio's plan would disband the association and require the
insurance industry to pay off $1.4 billion of the pool's $3 billion
debt over seven years without passing the cost on to customers.
   A replacement bad-driver plan would have tighter state controls
to make sure it includes no more than 10 percent of New Jersey
motorists, compared with the more than 50 percent once covered.
   Critics of the current arrangement say it does not encourage
insurers to save the pool money in the payment of claims and
settlements. After a lack of state oversight allowed the pool and
its debt to grow far beyond anyone's expectations, a state audit
accused insurers of systematically overcharging the pool.
   Florio would have the state limit how much doctors can charge
for treating accident victims and how much may be charged for
towing and storing vehicles.
   The plan would eliminate what Florio says is price-fixing by the
auto insurance companies by taking away their antitrust exemption.
   Motorists would also have to pay higher auto registration fees.
   The plan was was praised by Democrats and lawyers but received a
cool reaction from Republicans and the insurance industry. Leaders
of the Democrat-controlled Legislature said the proposal will get a
swift hearing.
   Robert Gaines, vice president of the American Insurance
Association, said it would be illegal to require the industry to
pay off the Joint Underwriting Association debt without passing the
cost on to drivers.
   Florio insisted the state is on firm legal ground.

   FBI agents investigating the
mail-bombings that killed a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer
searched the salvage business and home of a man who lost an appeal
before a panel that included the judge.
   A published report today indicated the agents may have been
looking for a typewriter used in letters from the bomber. A
relative of the man whose property was searched said FBI agents
asked family members about an old typewriter, but the agents did
not say why.
   Robert Wayne O'Ferrell was questioned most of the day Monday,
and agents with bomb-sniffing dogs searched his sprawling
Enterprise junk warehouse, a smaller junk shop, and his home in
nearby New Brockton, about 75 miles from Montgomery. Police and a
bomb squad from a nearby Army base joined the search.
   No charges were filed against O'Ferrell or anyone else, agent
Chuck Archer of Mobile said. Agents suspended their search at about
10 p.m., and police sealed O'Ferrell's property.
   The farms of O'Ferrell's father, Jay, and brother Buddy also
were searched, according to a cousin, Jerry O'Ferrell of Mobile. He
said he spoke with O'Ferrell's sister Monday night and ``they're
all shocked. He's not the type person who would do this.''
   O'Ferrell, 46, described by a neighbor as a former Baptist
preacher who once sold insurance and took up the junk business
about three years ago, was released after questioning and was back
at his home this morning.
   He told reporters he was cooperating in the investigation and
may have a statement at an appropriate time. He then asked the
reporters to leave his property.
   Court records show O'Ferrell was involved in a case heard by
U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Vance, killed last month when a package
bomb sent through the mail exploded at his home near Birmingham.
   O'Ferrell had sued Gulf Life Insurance Co. of Jacksonville,
Fla., for firing him, disputing the company's claim that he held
licenses with other insurance companies. O'Ferrell also claimed
Gulf Life owed him commissions.
   A federal judge in Montgomery dismissed the lawsuit in June
1988. Last April, Vance and two other judges on the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court ruling in a
one-page unsigned decision.
   The Atlanta Constitution, quoting unidentified federal sources,
reported today that an agent reviewing files at the appeals court
discovered correspondence from O'Ferrell that apparently matched
typewritten letters from the bomber.
   O'Ferrell's son-i-law, John Cauley, who lives with his wife on
O'Ferrell's property, said agents asked family members about an old
typewriter, but did not indicate why they were interested in it.
   Cauley said he told them his father-in-law had several old
typewriters at his business but none at home.
   ``They asked me all kinds of stuff, like if he knew about the
letter bombs and if he was violent,'' Cauley said. ``I told them he
wasn't violent and that he couldn't hurt anybody.'' Cauley said
O'Ferrell never mentioned the mail-bombings when they happened.
   Package bombs sent through the mail exploded and killed Vance on
Dec. 16 and a black lawyer, Robert Robinson of Savannah, Ga., two
days later. Other mailed bombs were defused at the 11th Circuit
courthouse in Atlanta and the NAACP office in Jacksonville, Fla.
   The FBI has said one or more white racists appeared to be behind
the attacks. One agent said a possible profile of the bomber was a
man in his 50s not connected with any white supremacist group.
Wayne O'Ferrell's name is not in a file of white hate group members
kept by the Klanwatch program of the Southern Poverty Law Center in
Montgomery, director Morris Dees said today.
   Archer declined to say what evidence brought the investigation
to O'Ferrell's property. Archer also would not say specifically
what the agents were looking for in the search or what, if
anything, was found.
   FBI agents also questioned O'Ferrell's neighbors.
   Tina Sommerville, who lives across the street from the
warehouse, said the FBI ``asked me had I ever noticed any strange
activity, or if I had ever noticed any unusual number of cars over
there, or unusual number of people over there, or if he had ever
shown a violent temper.
   ``I said, `No, I had never seen any of that.'''
   ``They are just average people,'' she said of O'Ferrell, his
wife and two daughters. ``He was always reading the Bible.''
   Neighbors Jim and Joan Ziglar said O'Ferrell had always referred
to himself as a minister on his mailbox, but they had never known
him to preach regularly at any church during his 13 years at the
small, wood-frame home.
   Another neighbor, Robert Thomas, said O'Ferrell didn't have the
expertise to pull off the bombings. ``He couldn't even do the
wiring in his house. How's he going to build a bomb?''

   The new government today postponed the
first democratic elections in more than four decades until May 20
because fledgling opposition parties asked for more time to
organize, a senior official said.
   Dimitru Mazilu, a senior member of the governing National
Salvation Front, also said members of the front would run for
Parliament. He said U.N. observers would be asked to monitor the
balloting, which had been planned for April.
   Earlier today, Justice Minister Teodor Vasiliu said four close
associates of toppled dictator Nicolae Ceausescu will stand trial
Saturday on charges that include aiding in mass killings.
   A historian, meanwhile, said Ceasuescu and his wife bolted in
panic and tried to flee the firing squad that lined up to execute
them. The dictator was finally cornered and shot, while his wife
was initially shot in the back, said historian Cristian Popisteanu,
quoting a witness he did not identify.
   The governing council recently agreed in principle that a delay
in the elections was necessary. Mazilu said the postponement was
decided on following requests from the more than one dozen new and
revived opposition parties seeking more time to prepare for
balloting.
   ``The council, to demonstrate good will, and the desire to
ensure objectivity in the elections, has declared its readiness to
receive a group of observers from the United Nations,'' he added.
   Communists took power in Romania after World War II, and no
democratic elections have been held. The National Salvation Front
promised free elections after taking power in the popular
revolution that toppled Ceausescu Dec. 22.
   The front also said it had no political aspirations and would
only be a transition government. Its announcement that the front
also would field candidates is a reversal from that earlier stand.
   Justice Minister Teodor Vasiliu told state radio that the four
Ceausescu aides to be tried Saturday are former Communist Party
Secretary Emil Bobu, No. 3 in the party hierarchy behind Ceausescu
and his wife, Elena; former Interior Minister Tudor Postelnicu, who
was in charge of the secret police; and ex-Politburo members Manea
Manesacu and Ion Dinca.
   Romania's prosecutor-general said last week that virtually the
entire leadership of the Romanian Communist Party is under arrest,
including Ceausescu's son, Nicu, the former local party boss in
Sibiu, 180 miles northwest of Bucharest.
   Gheorghe Robu, the prosecutor-general, told the newspaper
Adevarul that the four will be tried by a military tribunal at the
Ministry of Defense. The trial will be telecast live.
   The new government said more than 60,000 people were killed
during Ceausescu's 24-year rule, and it characterizes the deaths as
genocide.
   A military court sentenced Ceausescu and his wife to death Dec.
25 after their conviction on charges of genocide and other crimes.
   Adevarul said the four to be tried are charged with abetting
genocide, which is punishable by a maximum 20 years in prison.
   Relating the Ceausescus' last moments, Popisteanu said the
Ceausescus bolted from soldiers in a courtyard of the garrison
where they were held and were chased through the courtyard for ``10
minutes or more'' before being gunned down.
   ``He (Ceausescu) was forced into a corner and shot,''
Popisteanu, editor of the Magazin Istoric, said in an interview.
   ``She was shot in the back but only to stop her. Then all the
soldiers shot at her from the front,'' the historian said.
   Popisteanu said he did not know how many soldiers were involved,
but a leader of the National Salvation Front, Silviu Brucan, told
the French daily Le Figaro on Monday that the entire 80-man squad
fired at Ceausescu and Elena. They reportedly found a total of 120
bullet holes in their bodies.
   Also today, the government ordered the dismantling of the Stefan
Gheorghiu Social and Political Academy, which had been used to
train government and secret police officials.
   The shutdown of the academy _ a seat of Marxist-Leninist
indoctrination _ was one of the demands of the 2,000 university
students who demonstrated in downtown Bucharest Sunday.

   Extremists ambushed a military convoy carrying
women and children in Azerbaijan, and two soldiers and a bystander
were killed, official media said today. The KGB said the republic
was on the brink of chaos.
   Hopes for an end to 10 days of ethnic strife between Armenia and
Azerbaijan surfaced Monday when Communist Party and government
officials from the republics agreed to try to end the fighting.
   But Radio Moscow reported today the situation in Baku remained
``very, very tense.'' It said the military commander of
Azerbaijan's capital vowed his troops were ready to stop further
attacks.
   Anti-Armenian riots and killings in Baku on Jan. 13 ignited
ethnic warfare between Azerbaijanis and Armenians. Azerbaijanis
have since threatened to secede from the Soviet Union.
   Soviet troops smashed their way into Baku on Saturday to quell
the nationalist uprising, and Soviet officials said the assault
left 83 dead, including 14 soldiers and members of their families.
   On Monday, Azerbaijanis marched through the Caspian Sea port
city of 1.8 million to mourn those killed when the Soviet troops
moved in. Radio Moscow said anti-army and anti-Russian sentiments
were being whipped up by ``irresponsible people'' sending
threatening unsigned letters and making anonymous phone calls.
   Suspicious Baku residents also prevented two ships carrying the
families of soldiers stationed in the area from leaving the port,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said in Moscow
today.
   He said Azerbaijanis suspected bodies of people killed in the
assault on Baku were being smuggled out. They apparently thought
authorities wanted to claim casualties were lower than in reality.
   ``Nothing was found in the holds,'' Gerasimov told a news
briefing.
   Radio Moscow, in a broadcast monitored in London by the British
Broadcasting Corp., said troops sent to Azerbaijan came under fire
four times Monday and overnight, including an attack on a convoy of
recently demobilized servicemen also carrying women.
   Baku Radio, also monitored by the BBC, said two soldiers and a
woman bystander were killed in that attack.
   ``The extremists are thus continuing their criminal
activities,'' Baku's military commander, Lt. Gen. Vladimir
Dubinyak, was quoted by the Azerbaijani radio as saying.
   The deaths brought the overall toll in the unrest to 170 killed
since the Baku riots, with more than 600 wounded.
   Azerbaijan's KGB expressed alarm in its appeal to residents of
the republic for calm, Radio Moscow said.
   ``Azerbaijan is on the edge of the abyss, beyond which lie chaos
and anarchy,'' the KGB warned.
   Arif Yunusov, a spokesman for the independent Social Democratic
Group political organization, said Baku was paralyzed today by a
general strike.
   All shops in the major oil refining center were closed, no
morning newspapers were published and Azerbaijan's state-run
television was off the air, said Sivinch Abdullayeva, an editor at
Azerinform, the republic's official news agency.
   Yunusov said fighting continued near Salyanskiye Barracks in
Baku, with 263 Azerbaijani military cadets and more than 130
classmates of other Soviet ethnic groups opposing Soviet troops who
have cordoned off the area.
   Dubinyak told the Krasnaya Zvezda military daily there was still
intermittent gunfire in the city but gave no details. In a
statement broadcast on Radio Moscow, the general said ``there are
forces here with an interest in maintaining tension at the highest
level.''
   His wording indicated disagreement over how to deal with groups
such as the Azerbaijan People's Front. The political group
organized anti-Armenian rallies and led a drive to retain
sovereignty over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian enclave in
Azerbaijan whose demand to become part of Armenia in February 1988
ignited the nearly 2-year-old ethnic feud.
   A reporter for Soviet TV news on Monday spoke more favorably of
the People's Front, saying its members had ensured order that day
at funeral services in Baku attended by hundreds of thousands of
Azerbaijanis and were in control of some regions of Azerbaijan.
   ``Perhaps it is high time to sit down with them at the
negotiating table. Perhaps this could in some way prevent further
bloodshed,'' the correspondent said on the evening television news
program ``Vremya.''
   It was not known whether the front participated in the
negotiations in the Armenian town of Yeraskh that led to the peace
accord between officials of Azerbaijan and Armenia.
   In Yerevan, Armenia's capital, activist Samvel Gevorkyan said
the negotiations were supposed to resume today but it was not yet
clear whether they had.
   He accused Azerbaijanis of dragging out the talks because of
reluctance to admit a young Armenian taken hostage in the fighting
was dead. As soon as all hostages are released, Gevorkyan said,
negotiators will discuss more crucial issues such as a formal
cease-fire and an end to Azerbaijan's rail blockade of Armenia.
   The explosion into violence of the longstanding hostility
between mostly Christian Armenia and predominantly Moslem
Azerbaijan is one of the worst crises Gorbachev has faced in his
nearly five-year tenure as Soviet leader.
   His fostering of greater freedoms has fueled ethnic unrest
throughout the culturally diverse nation.
   Boris Yeltsin, an outspoken maverick in the Soviet Communist
Party and a Central Committee member, predicted during a visit to
Tokyo today that Gorbachev's rule ``would not last long'' unless he
carried out radical reforms that included autonomy for ethnic
groups and their republics.
   He accused Gorbachev of becoming more conservative. ``Gorbachev
is in very difficult position, and the blame should be put mainly
on himself,'' Yeltsin said.
   At Monday's mass rally in Baku, demonstrators carried posters
reading, ``Gorbachev is the butcher of the Azerbaijani people,''
said Shain Gajiyev, a local journalist.
   In Moscow, Azerbaijani activists claimed 3,700 people were
killed when Soviet troops stormed Baku, the official Tass news
agency said, emphasizing that the figure was unconfirmed.
   Foreign reporters were barred from the region, so it was
difficult to determine the exact death toll or reconcile
conflicting information.
   Armenia's popular movements also condemned Moscow for the Baku
deaths.
   When Armenians demanded protection for themselves and punishment
for Azerbaijani extremists who victimized them, they ``did not mean
a deployment of the Soviet army in a large-scale, bloody action,
but the use of civilized methods proper to a law-based state,'' the
Armenian Board of National Movements said in a statement, read over
the phone by Yerevan activist Rafael Popayan.
   The total number of Soviet forces now combating the violence in
Armenia and Azerbaijan is reported to be 29,000. The number of
militants is reported in the thousands.

   The country's Communist leaders
failed today to reunite their fractured party after delegates from
liberal-minded Slovenia stormed out of a party congress and said
they would form a new party.
   Delegates from Croatia, the second largest of Yugoslavia's six
republics, today appeared to back the Slovenian move, which
threatened the unity of the ethnically diverse and economically
troubled Yugoslav federation.
   Slovenian party spokeman Peter Bekes said his republic's
delegation would establish an ``independent party on the basis of
democratic socialism'' at a regional party conference on Feb. 2.
   The republic's party leader, Ciril Ribicic, said the Slovenian
party could ``never again be a part of the Communist Party of
Yugoslavia in the manner that it has been up to now _ an
institutionalized permanent minority.'' His comments were carried
by Tanjug, the state news agency.
   The Croatian delegates, in a statement, said voting would be
invalid without the participation of delegations from all of the
country's six republics and two provinces.
   The statement made clear the Croatian Communists would not
return to the congress if Slovenia doesn't also.
   The dramatic walkout came as delegates were preparing for a
final vote on a reform document that would relinquish the party's
45-year monopoly on power.
   But the vote never came and the congress was forced to adjourn
late Monday _ a day ahead of schedule _ with no date set for a new
session.
   Leading Slovenian Communist Milan Kucan told journalists that
the breakup of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the official
name of the ruling party, ``is the only possible consequence of
this action.''
   In announcing the Slovenian decision, Ribicic said the congress
had failed to accept any of his delegation's proposals.
   The delegates from the relatively prosperous northern republic
wanted a declaration of greater autonomy for the country's six
republics, a promise to end persecution of political opponents and
greater cooperation with the West.
   ``We are not going to take part in the agony of the Communist
Party in Yugoslavia,'' he said, and the entire Slovenian delegation
grimly left the hall.
   Slovenia is to hold the country's first multiparty elections in
March and its moves toward democracy and tolerance of dissent are
opposed by hard-liners such as the leaders of the Serbian republic,
the country's most populous.
   Serbia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, took the podium after
the walkout and said the suspension of the congress would mean that
``the party would be practically disbanded and decapitated.''
   He said this could have ``grave consequences for the Communist
Party and future of the country.''
   The Serbian leadership opposes doing away with central economic
planning and Milosevic seeks to impose stronger central control on
the republics. Some critics say he deliberately sought a showdown
with the Slovenians to deflect attention from his economic and
political failures.
   The Serbians comprise 9 million of the country's 23 million
people and many consider themselves Yugoslavia's ethnic core.
Slovenia has a population of 2 million.
   Party President Milan Pancevski, speaking to tired delegates
early today after the party's leadership failed in a four-hour
emergency session to end the crisis, called on regional party
bodies to work for a solution.
   The congress broke down after it cast a preliminary vote early
Monday in favor of relinquishing the party's monopoly on power.
   The Slovenians complained that hard-liners had watered down key
reform points in the document. They criticized those who voted
against abolishing all laws allowing the persecution of political
opponents.
   They also complained about delegates' scrapping of a statement
that backed seeking membership in European organizations such as
the European Community.
   Until last year's upheaval in Eastern Europe, the Communist
regime in non-aligned Yugoslavia had been considered progressive
when compared to those in the Soviet bloc.
   But the country has long struggled with ethnic tensions and
rivalries among its republics. It also faces mounting labor unrest
stemming largely from inefficient centralized economic planning.
   Its decentralized and often inefficient system of government,
which includes a collective federal presidency, was devised in the
1974 constitution of the late President Josip Broz Tito to prevent
one republic from dominating the others.
   The federal government has pledged to introduce a multiparty
system before the country's first free elections, which are set for
April
   Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Poland and Hungary have
abolished the leading role of the Communist Party in recent months.

<HEAD>School Smoking Ban Snuffed Out in Kentucky</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill banning smoking in school by
youngsters was rejected by lawmakers today in this tobacco country
state.
   The traditionally pro-tobacco House Agriculture and Small
Business Committee voted 10-3 against the measure, which would bar
students from smoking in elementary and high schools.
   Kentucky was the nation's No. 1 producer of burley, or
air-cured, tobacco, with sales of $471.7 million in 1988, the
latest year for which figures are available.
   Tobacco is Kentucky's No. 1 cash crop, and the state has no age
restrictions for buying cigarettes. Kentucky also had the highest
percentage of smokers, 37.9 percent, according to a 1988 survey by
the federal Centers for Disease Control.
   In 1988, the Legislature gave local school administrators the
option of establishing smoking areas for students.
   ``Cigarettes kill you,'' said Rep. Tom Burch, a co-sponsor of
the measure banning smoking in schools. ``Do we just feed poison to
our kids from now on? If you're for the health of our children in
the commonwealth, you will support this bill.''
   Opponents of the bill said the decision on whether to ban
smoking should be made by school superintendents. ``Why are they
asking us to tell their kids not to smoke when they have that
authority themselves?'' said Rep. Ray Altman.
   Committee members attached an amendment to expand the smoking
ban to everyone at school, including administrators and teachers.
Rep. Mark Farrow, who offered the amendment, said it would allow
adults to set an example for youngsters.

<TEXT>
   Mariano Rumor, a former five-time
Christian Democrat premier who led coalition governments in the
tumultuous 1960s and 1970s, has died of a heart attack at age 74.
   Rumor, who died Monday night, was premier at a time when Italy
was wracked by student protests, labor unrest, and terrorism from
the right and left.
   A senator at the time of his death, his political career began
when he joined a Catholic organization critical of fascist dictator
Benito Mussolini.
   During World War II, Rumor served in the Italian army from 1940
to 1943, and then joined the underground resistance movement to
fight the German occupiers.
   After the war, Rumor joined the ranks of the Christian
Democrats. He was first elected to Parliament in 1948, and
appointed to his first Cabinet post _ agriculture _ in 1959.
   In 1963, he succeeded Aldo Moro as secretary of the Christian
Democrats, traditionally a stepping stone to the premiership.
   During his tenure as premier, he was criticized for
indecisiveness, particularly in facing the challenge of labor
unions in 1970.
   In 1976, a year after his last premiership ended, he was
investigated for suspected involvement in the 1969 Lockheed payoff
scandal involving the U.S. aircraft company. Parliament cleared him
of any wrongdoing.
   He also was exonerated of any participation in a coverup linked
to the 1969 bombing of a Milan bank in which 16 people were killed.
The bombing was blamed on neo-fascists.

   A man who went to prison for strangling a
child was indicted today on charges of murdering 10 women in the
two years since his parole.
   Police had charged Arthur J. Shawcross with eight of the
slayings after his arrest on Jan. 3, although they said they
suspected him in all 10.
   He also has been charged with the choking death of a woman in a
neighboring county.
   Police said most of the victims, whose bodies were found between
March 1988 and Jan. 4, were prostitutes or heavy drug users. Most
were strangled or suffocated.
   Shawcross, 44, was arrested after state troopers found him
sitting in a car near the frozen body of one of his victims.
   Shawcross was paroled in 1987 after 15 years in prison for the
strangling of an 8-year-old girl in Watertown. At the time of his
arrest in 1972, he also confessed to killing a 10-year-old boy but
was never charged in that death.
   Shawcross was working as a food-service worker in Rochester at
the time of his arrest. State officials said he had been considered
a model parolee.

   Police said Tuesday they believed a leak of
pressurized air from a tunnel under construction caused a street to
``erupt,'' showering pedestrians with water, stones and mud.
   Ten people were injured, including three who were hurt as a
crowd jostled for a better view.
   Officials pulled out two cars and a motor scooter that had been
swallowed up in the hole that was 42 feet long, 32 feet wide and 17
feet deep. No one fell in.
   A police official emphasized that investigators had not
determined the exact cause of Monday's eruption but believed the
pressurized air was to blame.
   Air pressure in the tunnel is being kept high to prevent
underground water from entering, and there is a strong possibility
that pressurized air escaped to the surface, 46 feet above the
tunnel, said Tadao Hasegawa, an engineer of the construction
company Kumagaigumi Ltd.
   Under a contract with Japan Railways, Kumagaigumi is digging a
tunnel for express trains.

   This summer's Festival of Two Worlds at Spoleto will
feature productions of classical and modern music ranging from
Mozart's opera, ``Le Nozze di Figaro'' to ``Hydrogen Jukebox'' by
Philip Glass, organizers said Tuesday.
   The international menu of culture will take place June 27-July
15 in the medieval town about 65 miles north of Rome.
   Opening night will see Paris' Orchestre de l'Opera Bastille on
its first international tour performing Hector Berlioz' ``Symphonie
Fantastique'' led by director Myung Whun Chung.
   Lyrical productions will include Richard Strauss' ``Elektra.''
Giuseppe Verdi's ``Requiem Mass,'' performed in the square in front
of Spoleto's cathedral, will close the festival.
   The festival was founded in 1957 by composer Gian Carlo Menotti
with the aim of merging the cultural worlds of Europe and America.
In 1977, Menotti took the festival to Charleston, S.C., and in
1986, he expanded the project to Melbourne, Australia.
   The festival also will feature other art and science exhibits,
ballets, concerts and films.

   President Vaclav Havel today
announced he will invite President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to hold a future summit in Prague.
   Havel made the disclosure in a speech to Parliament that was
carried live on state television.
   ``I personally would like to present to Mr. Gorbachev various
important and mutually interrelated proposals, including the offer
to hold his future (summit) meeting with Mr. Bush in Prague,'' said
Havel, who plans to visit the Soviet leader in Moscow in early
February.
   He added, ``Naturally, I will present the same proposal shortly
afterward to Mr. Bush during the big state visit to the United
States.''
   No precise dates of Havel's visits to Moscow and Washington have
been announced so far.
   Gorbachev and Bush already have scheduled their next summit for
June somewhere in the United States. No exact location has been
disclosed. The two leaders last met on ships off the coast of Malta
in December.
   At the White House, spokesman Roman Popadiuk said U.S. officials
received no official word on the invitation and that officials only
had seen news accounts. ``There are no plans for anything beyond
the June summit at this time,'' he said.
   Havel, a playwright who served five years in prison under
Czechoslovakia's hard-line Communist rule, led a grass-roots
movement that staged a peaceful revolution for democratic reform in
November and December. Parliament elected him president of the new
non-Communist government on Dec. 29.
   On his first presidential trip aboard, he visited the German
states in early January. He will visit Poland and Hungary in late
January.
   ``Their journey to democracy is also our journey, and with them,
(Poland, Hungary and Romania) we want to coordinate our journey as
much as possible,'' he told the Parliament.

   A military transport plane crashed
today in heavy fog west of Caracas, killing all 24 people on board,
according to rescue workers.
   The the aircraft went down this morning near El Junquito,a
hamlet about 15 miles west of Caracas.
   ``We brought three ambulances up here immediately, but all we've
found are corpses,'' said Mercedes Vivas, a doctor with Caracas
firefighters. ``We don't expect to find any survivors.''
   According to rescue workers, the Spanish-built, twin-engine
military transport went down at approximately 7:45 a.m., (6:45 a.m.
EST) in heavy fog.
   ``It was flying low. It didn't sound like motor trouble,'' said
a man living nearby who said he witnessed the crash.
   National guard troops, firefighters and police rescue workers
were searching the rubble at the site of the crash, but so far
there were no survivors found, according to rescue workers.
   Forensic experts had yet to arrive on the scene.
   Most of the corpses were scarred beyond recognition, according
to rescue workers.
   The transport carried three crew members and 21 enlisted men and
officers who were the passengers, according to state news agency
Venpress.
   The Defense Ministry had no information other than confirmation
of the airplane's crash.
   The plane had left Caracas's Maiquetia airport and was headed
fpr Puerto Ayacucho, about 400 miles south of Caracas, according to
airport officials.
   Initial speculation was that the plane had crashed due to bad
weather and poor visibility over the valley of Caracas, according
to state news agency Venpress.

   A senior administration arms control adviser
raised concerns Tuesday about unilateral Soviet troop withdrawals
from Eastern and Central Europe, saying they could increase
political pressure for ``tit-for-tat'' cutbacks in the West.
   Edward L. Rowny, a former negotiator who counsels President Bush
and Secretary of State James A. Baker III on arms control issues,
said it would be far better to carry out troop withdrawals under a
treaty now being negotiated between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   Despite ``unprecedented progress,'' Rowny said several vital
issues remained unresolved in the Vienna talks. He said they
include Soviet insistence on excluding large numbers of combat
aircraft from treaty controls and not accepting Western demands
that withdrawn troops be demobolized.
   Also, he said, the Soviets so far have agreed only to remove
military equipment that would be barred under the treaty _ not to
destroy it, as negotiators for the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization insist.
   And yet, Rowny said, the end of the Communist Party's monopoly
on power in the Soviet bloc ``makes prospects for completing a
sound conventional forces reduction treaty more promising.''
   The senior U.S. official spoke at Yale University in New Haven,
Conn. His prepared remarks were distributed in Washington.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev have
set completion of the treaty as one of their arms control goals for
1990. And Rowny, in a detailed review, listed many more issues as
being resolved than still unsettled.
   He also raised several questions about the withdrawals of troops
and tanks that the Soviets have begun from Central and Eastern
Europe outside the treaty. Pressure is building from the new
leaders of Czechoslovakia and Hungary for further reductions.
   Rowny said pullouts could be verified only under a treaty.
   He noted that Congressional observers last summer determined
that while the Soviets had withdrawn some tanks from Eastern Europe
they had left other weapons, including artillery, behind.
   ``It is also significant that unilateral cuts can be reversed
unilaterally,'' he said.
   And, in another ``cautionary note,'' the former lieutenant
general said Soviet reductions announced ``with the full fanfare of
the Soviet public relations apparatus'' tends to increase political
pressure for equal unilateral cuts in the West.
   Rowny referred to Bush's proposal for deeper Soviet troops cuts
than the United States would make under the treaty. His call for a
ceiling of 275,000 for each side in Europe would mean a pullback of
nearly 300,000 Soviet soldiers and 38,000 American troops.
   ``Tit-for-tat reductions not only would blur the asymmetry
problem but also would blur the distinction between the nature of
the U.S. military presence in Europe versus the Soviets' armed
presence there,'' Rowny said.
   There are an estimated 52,000 Soviet troops in Hungary, 40,000
in Poland and 75,000 in Czechoslovakia. Most of the U.S. troops are
in West Germany.

<HEAD>Congress Back; Veto Override Effort on Chinese Students Bill Seen</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts graf 3, We're working, with Fitzwater comment.
Editing throughout.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress came together today for an
election-year session, with leaders predicting a quick override of
President Bush's veto of legislation protecting Chinese students in
the United States from being forced to return to their homeland.
   Republicans predicted Bush would get no more than a handful of
votes in the House, where the veto override was expected to come up
on Wednesday.
   ``We're working to sustain the veto,'' presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater told reporters aboard Air Force One as Bush flew
to Kansas City to deliver an anti-drug message. He said the
president has talked to some members of Congress on the matter and
plans to continue that lobbying.
   The House had approved the legislation, 403-0, last Nov. 19, and
it was virtually certain that backers could obtain the two-thirds
majority needed to put the bill into law over the president's
objections.
   Senate Minority Whip Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., who was supporting
the White House, predicted the override would nevertheless pass in
the Senate ``like a dose of salts.''
   The issue is the first major fight of what promises to be a busy
and potentially contentious year on Capitol Hill, further
complicated by the partisanship that will arise as November
elections draw near for all 435 House seats and 34 of the 100
Senate seats.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., predicted the
Democratic-controlled Congress will turn attention from the
military and international problems he said have been government's
focus for the past decade to ``the domestic problems we face as a
society _ competitiveness, education, health, the strength of our
economy and society.''
   Topping the agenda are initiatives on clean air, child care and
campaign finance reform, as well as the intractable budget deficit
and decisions on how much to cut from defense spending and how much
to give to emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and Panama.
   Fights also loom on Bush's proposal to cut the capital gains tax
and on competing Democratic proposals to cut Social Security taxes
or revive tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts.
   The veto override was the only substantive business before the
House in its first week back after a two-month holiday recess. The
bill Bush vetoed Nov. 30 would let some 32,000 Chinese students
extend their stays and avoid political persecution stemming from
last June's brutally repressed pro-democracy movement. A Senate
vote is expected as early as Thursday.
   ``How can we, the United States of America, lead people on to
talk about democracy and human rights and then when they speak out
for it, say `Don't look to us to protect you?''' said Rep. Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif., the bill's sponsor.
   Backers of the Chinese students bill say the lifting of martial
law in Beijing on Jan. 10 was little more than a cosmetic gesture.
Students testifying at a Senate hearing today said they had been
harassed by Chinese consular officials in this country, including
veiled threats against family members still in China.
   Republicans have joined in publicly criticizing Bush's veto.
   ``There's been no letup in the beatings and trials'' of
dissidents, said Rep. William Broomfield of Michigan, the senior
Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. To let the veto
stand ``would be obviously sending the wrong signal to the rest of
the world about what took place just a few months ago,'' he said.
   Members of Congress in both parties were angered by Bush's
efforts to warm relations with Beijing in the absence of human
rights concessions. They were particularly incensed by the
president's secret dispatching of high-level emissaries to Beijing
on at least two occasions since the crackdown, a move Bush said he
made to prevent isolating China.
   The administration is fighting the veto override in the Senate,
where it needs to enlist 34 senators to block the attempt.
   Before Bush's Nov. 30 veto, 74 senators, including 26
Republicans, signed a letter urging him not to kill the measure.
   But the White House argues that since then, Bush has provided at
least as much protection to the students through administrative
steps as the bill would have afforded. The veto preserves Bush's
foreign policy prerogatives but does not affect the students, the
administration contends. A vote to override will be simply
``gratuitously bashing the president,'' said Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   Pelosi contended, however, Bush doesn't have authority to give
airtight protection to the students through administrative actions
and noted the Bush gesture could be revoked at any time.
   The vetoed bill would affect 32,000 of the estimated 40,000
Chinese students in the United States, those who hold ``exchange
visitor'' visas. Such visas require students to return to China for
at least two years following their time in the United States before
being able to return or go elsewhere. The bill would waive that
requirement.
   Even if the override attempt succeeds, the Bush administration
still could raise constitutional objections and force Congress to
go to court to enforce its action. The White House regards its
action as a pocket veto and not subject to an override because it
came eight days after Congress had adjourned for the year.

   The French celebrated Snoopy on Tuesday, saying
that happiness is a warm puppy _ even one that's 40 years old.
   The beguiling beagle who appears in Charles Schulz's comic strip
``Peanuts'' was honored with a blockbuster retrospective worthy of
the World War I flying ace, bird-lover and faithful friend to that
round-headed kid.
   Schulz, by the way, also was honored. He was named Commander of
Arts and Letters, one of France's highest awards for excellence in
the arts.
   ``Thank you for being the creator of Snoopy, full of humor and
with a zest for life,'' Culture Minister Jack Lang told Schulz.
``Your character is both mythical and hedonistic and he has taken
over our collective consciousness and become a part of our everyday
lives.''
   Schulz, beaming but appearing slightly embarrassed by the
attention, said that during Snoopy's war years when he battled the
Red Baron, he once explained how he learned to speak French.
   ``He said he had a small tourist phrase book, but he told me you
only really need to know one word, and that is, `Merci,''' Schulz
said in English.
   Ceremonies took place at the Decorative Arts Museum, which is
honoring the whimsical dog with a retrospective featuring Snoopy
memorabilia.
   Eve Dutton, director of special events at Determined
Productions, which co-sponsored the show with the Paris museum,
said Schulz was ``shocked'' when asked to participate in the show,
which opens to the public Wednesday and runs through April 22.
   ``He considers himself a simple cartoonist, not a great artist
worthy of a show at the Louvre. He just couldn't believe it,'' she
said.
   As an art collector himself _ Snoopy once had a van Gogh but
lost it when his dog house caught fire in 1966 _ the beagle knew he
was in good company, Schulz said.
   He said Snoopy felt ``quite humble'' about being hung not far
from the Mona Lisa.
   Schulz, 67, recounted that on his first day of school, his
teacher had predicted he would be an artist.
   ``I'm glad she didn't say someday you'll be in the Louvre,
because I would have been nervous for 60 years waiting for it,'' he
said. The Decorative Arts Museum is in the northern wing of the
Louvre palace, not actually part of the main museum.
   The show is sure to please Snoopy lovers. Born in 1950, he is a
dreamer and a gourmet, a heartwarming mix of fun, deadpan wit and
even sarcasm when dealing with his master Charlie Brown, Lucy and
the other ``Peanuts'' characters, who are much less familiar to
French audiences than Snoopy himself.
   At the show, children can catch up on old strips in a special
reading corner, watch Snoopy videos or listen to Snoopy's music,
recorded by several leading American jazz musicians.
   The highlight of the exhibit is Snoopy as a ``chic chien'' _ 300
stuffed versions of the beagle and his sister, Belle, dressed by
the world's leading fashion designers including Chanel, Christian
Lacroix, Hermes and Georgio Armani.
   Youngsters are invited to design their own outfit for Snoopy,
and the winner will receive a giant stuffed beagle.
   Original ``Peanuts'' drawings in the show came from Schulz's
vault in Santa Rosa, Calif. Other items are from Schulz's private
collection, including commemorative plates and souvenirs from the
Apollo 10 mission in 1969 when the command module was named Charlie
Brown and the lunar module was named Snoopy.
   After Paris, the show will travel to Japan's Mitsukoshi
department store in Toyko and the Los Angeles Country Museum of
Natural History.
   Asked how Snoopy is facing up to 40, Schulz said: ``He stays in
good shape and he'll be better than ever.''

<TEXT>
   The one-time model who cooperated with federal
authorities in the arrest of Mayor Marion Barry on a cocaine
possession charge appeared today before a federal grand jury
investigating Barry's activities.
   Rasheeda Moore made her appearance as Barry aides, local union
leaders and business officials sought to persuade Jesse Jackson to
join the mayor's race in the aftermath of Barry's arrest.
   Ms. Moore, who sources said called Barry to the hotel room where
he was arrested Thursday night, spent about 2{ hours in the grand
jury room after entering the courthouse under tight security. The
38-year-old former model said nothing as she entered or left the
building through the back door.
   Amid the political maneuvering, Barry flew south on Monday and
checked into a substance abuse treatment center in West Palm Beach,
Fla., to be treated for alcoholism, according to his spokeswoman,
Lurma Rackley.
   Jackson is ``getting a lot of pressure to run. I don't know if
he's going to,'' said an associate of the two-time Democratic
presidential contender.
   ``A lot of the pressure is coming from Marion's people,'' added
the associate, who insisted on anonymity.
   Ron Richardson, president of the local chapter of the Hotel and
Restaurant Workers AFL-CIO, said he met with a variety of community
activists and organizers about mounting a draft-Jackson campaign.
   ``We are going to plead with him to submerge his personal
interests and help heal this city, which is what we need right
now,'' Richardson said. ``My indications are that people that I've
been talking to _ labor leaders, ministers, others _ are
overwhelmingly in favor of trying to get Jackson in the race.''
   Eric Easter, Jackson's press secretary, said the former
Democratic presidential hopeful has been ill in bed since returning
to Washington on Saturday and has met with no one regarding a
mayoral draft campaign.
   Jackson's move to Washington in April 1989 fueled rumors that he
would run for mayor. But Jackson has repeatedly said he would never
oppose Barry, a friend and former civil rights colleague.
   Early surveys of public sentiment gave Jackson a wide lead over
all other potential contenders, including Barry.
   A local political organizer said 20 labor leaders, business
officials and political activists from this heavily Democratic town
met for more than four hours on Sunday to discuss a Jackson
candidacy.
   When the meeting was over 14 of those present said their
companies or groups would be willing to woo Jackson, while three
others said they would support his candidacy if he enters the race,
said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   And as Barry mulled his treatment options on Saturday, some of
his closest political advisers and former assistants were meeting
at the home of ex-city administrator Elijah Rogers to organize
plans to get Jackson in the mayor's race.
   Ms. Rackley said the mayor checked into the Hanley-Hazelden
Treatment Center in West Palm Beach. She had said the day before
that details about his health would be kept private but ``the most
serious problem is alcoholism.''
   The 60-bed Florida clinic is an affiliate of a Minnesota clinic
that has treated more than 70,000 people since 1949, including
Kitty Dukakis, wife of Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts. Its
techniques were adopted by the better-known Betty Ford Clinic in
Rancho Mirage, Calif.
   The mayor was arrested Thursday and charged with misdemeanor
possession of crack cocaine. He said Sunday he would take steps to
``heal my body, mind and soul.'' Barry, who did not specifically
refer to a drug or alcohol problem in his remarks, did not speak to
reporters as he left home Monday accompanied by his wife Effi. She
later left Florida.
   Barry's plans to announce his candidacy Sunday for a fourth term
as mayor of the nation's capital were abruptly canceled. He tested
positive for cocaine in blood and urine tests administered after
his arrest, officials said.
   NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks said Monday after
meeting with President Bush that it appears to many blacks the
Barry arrest was part of a pattern of singling out elected black
officials for ``selective enforcement of the law.''

<HEAD>Sixteen Members of Chamber Symphony Quit in Contract Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixteen of the 24 tenured musicians of the
Minneapolis Chamber Symphony have quit after abstaining from voting
on a contract proposal.
   The musicians issued a statement Monday saying the orchestra's
board had threatened to disband the orchestra if the musicians
didn't ratify the contract. They said the board also threatened to
sue the union if they pursued in further negotiations their wish
for significant input in artistic decisions.
   Brad Eggen, union president, said the 18-month contract was
ratified by a majority of the eight remaining tenured musicians who
voted on it Sunday. ``We were committed to accepting the best
possible offer from the management,'' he said.
   Orchestra manager John Coughlin said he has no plans to cancel
any concerts. The orchestra usually plays with 26 musicians.
   ``We've got a Rolodex full of people who want to audition for
this orchestra,'' he said. ``We anticipate we'll have musicians of
as good _ or better _ caliber.''
   Concerning the board's threat to shut down the orchestra,
Coughlin said, ``It wasn't a threat against any specific musicians
but a statement that we had to get moving on this thing. We have a
concert in two weeks.''
   The board's threat to sue the union ``concerned whether the
artistic committee would have hiring and firing power of the music
director,'' he said.
   The musicians who quit said the contract violates union bylaws,
including provisions for donated services and broadcast recordings.
They also objected to being barred from board meetings and the
refusal of the board to divulge financial information.
   Coughlin said the symphony agreed in the contract to pay union
scale wages of $60.50 per two-hour concert. In addition, it will
pay musicians $16 apiece more for out-of-town performances, up from
$90 per two-hour concert.

<TEXT>
   Three American college teachers mark
their third year as hostages of Shiite Moslem kidnappers Wednesday
and there is little hope they or 15 other Westerners missing in
Lebanon will be freed soon.
   Lebanese police and intelligence officials said they had no new
information about Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse Turner.
They were abducted Jan. 24, 1987, from the campus of the
U.S.-affiliated Beirut University College in Moslem west Beirut by
gunmen dressed as policemen.
   The hostage held longest also is an American: Terry A. Anderson,
42, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who
was seized by Shiite gunmen March 16, 1985.
   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, a group believed
loyal to Iran, claimed responsibility for abducting the teachers.
   A fourth teacher kidnapped from the campus _ Mithileshwar Singh,
an Indian national with resident alien status in the United States,
was released Oct. 3, 1988.
   Steen, 50, taught journalism at the college. Polhill, 55, was
assistant professor of business and a lecturer in accounting, and
Turner, 42, was a visiting professor of mathematics and computer
science.
   ``We all feel humiliated ... that our uniforms were used in such
a crime,'' a police officer said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   He said police were ``not in a position to make any move'' with
regard to the hostages, most of whom are believed held gangs
affiliated with Hezbollah, a fundamentalist Shiite group loyal to
Iran.
   ``The hostages are not just a security case; they're a political
case,'' the officer said. ``Foreign nations are involved.''
   His apparent reference was to Iran and the home countries of the
hostages. The 18 include eight Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans, two Swiss citizens, an Irishman and an Italian.
   A Shiite source familiar with efforts to free the hostages, said
``any settlement ... must await the outcome of the power struggle
in Iran'' between hard-liners and the faction led by President
Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   Rafsanjai is believed to favor releasing the hostages as part of
his attempt to improve relations with the West and secure foreign
funds to help rebuild after eight years of war with Iraq.
   On the other side are radicals led by former Interior Minister
Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, who is fervently anti-Western and helped
establish Hezbollah in the early 1980s.
   Hezbollah has split into pro-Rafsanjani and pro-Mohtashemi
factions, but the Shiite source said the groups holding hostages
``obey Mohtashemi.''
   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine has accused the
three teachers of spying for the United States and Israel, and
offered to exchange them for 400 Arab prisoners held in Israel.
   Israel refused to negotiate and the United States has said it
will not insist the Israelis do so.
   A year after the kidnapping, the captors appeared to ease their
conditions, offering in a statement to free the three hostages if
the United States declared support for the Palestinian uprising in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   When Singh was released, the kidnappers provided a photograph
that showed Steen, Polhill and Turner saying goodbye to him.

<HEAD>Study Finds Tourists Scared to Vacation in Mississippi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUPELO, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many people are scared to vacation in
Mississippi because they belive the Magnolia State has long
stretches of unpaved highways and a ``Boss Hog'' legal system, a
study found.
   ``I was shocked that people actually feared for their safety,''
said J. Mac Holladay, executive director of the Mississippi
Department of Economic and Community Development.
   ``They think that Boss Hogg is around every corner,'' Holladay
said Monday referring to a corrupt character in the television
series ``Dukes of Hazzard'' set in the rural South. ``There is a
pervasive fear of Southern justice,'' he said at the Governor's
Conference on Tourism here.
   The results of the study, commissioned by the development agency
to guide tourism planning, didn't surprise Ann Woods, owner of the
Mount Holly Bed and Breakfast on Lake Washington near Greenville.
   She told of a New York lawyer and his wife who visited the
Delta. ``She was frightened the whole time, and she was from New
York City,'' Woods said.
   Holladay said while he expected the study to reveal negatives,
``the problems are certainly different than what I thought.'' Other
problems included fear of widespread poverty and of unfriendly
people and no knowledge of the state's tourism resources.
   A common attitude toward traveling in Mississippi is ``get
through that state as fast as you can,'' Holladay told about 200
representatives of the state's tourism industry. All state roads
and highways in the state are paved.
   Northerners feel especially unwelcome, the study showed. ``Some
visitors will not give where they're from out of fear,'' Holladay
said.
   The project was the second part of a $78,500 study of the
state's tourism industry conducted by Davidson-Peterson Associates.
The company conducted in-depth discussions with groups of people in
Memphis and Chicago who ``had no intention of traveling to
Mississippi,'' company president Tom Davidson said.
   Armed with the study and a $1 million advertising budget, the
development agency plans a series of regional print ads to emphasis
outdoor recreation facilities and the state's historical
attractions.

<HEAD>Mandela May Be Asked to be Mediator</HEAD>

   Black leader Nelson Mandela
may be asked to mediate between the government and the outlawed
African National Congress after his release from prison, the
justice minister said Tuesday.
   In an interview with the governing National Party's newspaper,
Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee the question no longer was whether
the 71-year-old ANC leader would be freed, ``but when and under
what circumstances.''
   Coetsee was reacting to intense speculation that Mandela will be
freed within weeks, but he gave no hints about a date. President
F.W. de Klerk is expected to elaborate in a speech opening
Parliament on Feb. 2.
   The Cabinet holds its first meeting of the year Wednesday in
Cape Town and likely will discuss Mandela's release as well as the
possible lifting of the 30-year ban on the ANC.
   In downtown Cape Town, scores of black and mixed-race youths
went on a rampage Tuesday after police used rubber bullets, tear
gas and a water cannon to disperse more than 5,000 students
protesting government education policies. Police had placed rolls
of barbed wire along the intended protest route and rejected
organizers' requests to allow the march to proceed.
   Youths threw stones through windows and overturned trash cans as
they fled from police. Some protesters were hurt when the water
cannon's spray knocked them into barbed wire, and at least one
youth was arrested.
   Another demonstration occurred inside a luxury hotel in
Johannesburg's northern suburbs, when more than 200 black employees
of the Sandton Sun paraded through the lobby and on escalators,
protesting the presence of an English cricket team on a
boycott-breaking tour of South Africa.
   Coetsee, in his interview with the Nationalist, said the
government had decided to free Mandela in accordance with its
policy of ``South Africa first'' and not because of international
pressure.
   He said Mandela was willing to serve as mediator between the
government and the ANC, which has waged a bombing and sabotage
campaign since 1961 aimed at undermining white domination.
   ``It could be be expected that the government is considering Mr.
Mandela for this role (of mediator),'' Coetsee said.
   Mandela, the most popular leader among South Africa's blacks, is
serving a life term for planning the start of the ANC sabotage
campaign. He has met regularly in recent months with government and
opposition leaders.
   The ANC's exiled leaders, at a conference last week, expressed
interest in negotiations but said the government must meet its
pre-conditions. These include Mandela's release, lifting of bans on
the ANC and other opposition groups, lifting of the state of
emergency imposed in 1986, and a halt to political trials.
   Beeld, a pro-government Johannesburg newspaper, said Tuesday
that Mandela's release would be accompanied by legalization of the
ANC. However, Beeld said the government would not release jailed
ANC members convicted of violent crimes.
   De Klerk received a report this week on the security situation
from top security officials to help him consider the timing of
reforms. Police commanders said the ANC's guerrilla campaign is
subsiding, an indication the government might lift or ease the
state of emergency.
   De Klerk has said he wants to remove obstacles in the way of
talks with the ANC, which has the largest following of any black
political organization. He is expected to outline plans for reform
when Parliament convenes next month.
   De Klerk has invited black leaders to negotiate a new
constitution that would extend political rights to the 28 million
blacks. But the president envisions a system in which the 5 million
whites would maintain some form of veto over major decisions.
   The Times of London, in a dispatch from Johannesburg, reported
Tuesday it was possible Mandela would propose an interim period of
black and white power sharing before a final shift to the
one-person, one-vote system that the ANC long has advocated.

   Firdous Ahmed pulled a Kalashnikov rifle
from under his long woolen caftan. Abdul Hamid, standing next to
him, flashed a Colt .45 revolver.
   ``We are the warriors of Islam,'' Ahmed said as residents of the
narrow lanes kept watch Tuesday for Indian troops in this Kashmir
city. At least 56 people, mostly Moslem militants, have been killed
since the army launched a crackdown Saturday.
   War cries reverberated through the neighborhood as unseen people
chanted from inside their homes: ``We are independent! God is
great! Kill Indian dogs!''
   Srinagar is the heart of the separatist movement in this
northern region, where militants like Ahmed and Hamid want to cast
off rule by predominantly Hindu India in favor of independence or
union with their Islamic neighbor, Pakistan.
   The city of 1 million people has been under an around-the-clock
curfew since Saturday, except for a few hours Tuesday, to try to
halt escalating attacks by the militants. Government troops have
been authorized to shoot curfew violators on sight.
   ``This is our holy war,'' said Ahmed, 23, who gave up his
college studies to join the guerrilla struggle. ``There is no
question of a truce. The battle has begun and will end with our
victory.''
   Kashmir, once a princely state, was divided between India and
Pakistan in 1947 when the two countries were partitioned upon
becoming independent from Britain. Srinagar and the surrounding
region became part of India's Jammu-Kashmir state, the only state
in India with a Moslem majority.
   Nationwide, Moslems are only 12 percent of India's 880 million
people. But they are 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's population of 5
million.
   ``The movement for autonomy is nothing new in Kashmir, but we
have to admit that today it appears it has come to a point of no
return,'' said Sabir Hussain, a state information officer.
   Ignoring the presence of an estimated 10,000 federal troops,
Moslem snipers moved across rooftops. On Monday, a paramilitary
policeman, wounded by sniper fire, was stoned to death by a mob.
   Before the latest flare-up, the militants had already imposed
their strict interpretations of the Koran, the holy book of the
Islamic faith.
   Restaurants and hotels stopped serving liquor in the Kashmir
valley, which attracted 500,000 Indian and foreign tourists in
1988. Women were ordered to wear burkhas, the all-enveloping
head-to-toe veils. Discotheques and beauty parlors closed.
   ``We have been told that all these things are against Islam and
ordered to stop,'' said Yogi Raina, a hotel manager.
   ``The entire valley is under the process of observing strict
Islamic codes,'' said a carpet dealer, one of the few Hindus left
in the business in Srinagar, on condition of anonymity. ``There is
nothing we can do about it.''
   A new organization called the Tigers of God issued threats last
month to anyone who failed to follow Islamic codes.
   Tiger leader Noor Khan led his guerrillas on a raid of hotel and
restaurant bars, smashing liquor bottles, according to people who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Srinagar's 10 cinemas and hundreds of video rental stores closed
after receiving bomb threats. So did beauty parlors.
   Frightened storekeepers dumped loads of playing cards in garbage
heaps next to their shops to show the militants they are no longer
selling items that can be used for gambling.
   ``It will be wrong to say the situation is out of control,''
said Jagmohan, who was appointed governor of Jammu-Kashmir state
last week by the federal government.
   ``You ask if things may have gone beyond repair _ maybe correct,
maybe not correct _ but try to understand that it is handful of
people. The rest do not want violence,'' said Jagmohan, a Hindu who
uses only one name and has a reputation as a no-nonsense
administrator.
   But if the mood and scenes in the city are any indication, many
people believe independence is possible.
   ``Like me, every day new holy warriors are born in Kashmir,''
said Firdous Ahmed, the guerrilla. He said ``excesses'' by Indian
troops, such as firing on curfew-breaking crowds, were spawning new
converts to the militants' cause.
   Jagmohan, the state governor, denied the charge of excesses.
``It is propaganda, just to raise the passion of the people,'' he
said.
   Abdul Hamid, who left his carpet business to join the
guerrillas, said the militants had enough arms, ammunition and
fighters to carry on their ``jihad,'' or Islamic holy war.
   ``When people are with you, you just need 100 guns to silence
even a mighty army,'' he said.

   Three newspapers and The Associated
Press filed papers opposing Exxon Corp. attempts to keep secret
most evidence gathered in more than 150 lawsuits arising from the
nation's worst oil spill.
   Exxon and other defendants, arguing that vital trade secrets
could be revealed in cases that might never go to trial, asked a
state court in December for an order barring pretrial disclosure of
virtually anything learned during discovery, the evidence-gathering
phase of a lawsuit.
   In a response Monday, a lawyer for The Wall Street Journal, Los
Angeles Times, Anchorage Daily News and the AP countered that Exxon
and the other defendants merely want to hide ``a variety of
embarrassing details'' about the March 24 wreck of the Exxon Valdez.
   A secrecy order could prevent the public from learning exactly
what caused the disaster, or why efforts to contain and clean up
more than 10 million gallons of crude oil from Prince William Sound
failed.
   ``The public spectacle of what happened in Prince William Sound
last spring and the defendants' ensuing conduct raises serious
questions about the credibility of the defendants,'' said Anchorage
lawyer D. John MacKay.
   ``There is every reason to worry that defendants are inclined to
excessive secrecy and lack of candor,'' MacKay wrote in a 48-page
brief filed in Anchorage Superior Court, where more than 150
lawsuits have been consolidated for pretrial motions and discovery.
   An attorney for Exxon disputed those arguments today. ``That
contradicts the fundamental issues of privacy, issues the papers
are insistent upon when it comes to their own files,'' Pat Lynch
said in Los Angeles.
   ``The orders proposed will expedite resolution of these cases
and ultimately give the public full and complete access to the
grounding and to all issues relevant to this case with the
protections everyone is entitled to have,'' Lynch said.
   MacKay said he filed a similar brief today in federal court,
where a parallel case is progressing.
   MacKay argued that a protective order would infringe upon the
First Amendment in a case with national implications. It ``would
preclude a fisherman or processor from talking with the press or
with his or her congressman, or an environmental organization from
talking to its members or a research scientist, about information
learned through the formal or informal discovery process.''
   Acknowledging that true trade secrets need to be protected,
MacKay said requests for protective orders should be evaluated on a
``document-by-document'' basis.
   In requesting the blanket protective order, Exxon asserted that
while individual documents might not contain any trade secrets,
taken in the aggregate they could give competitors an inside look
at the company's operations.
   Marnie Isaacs, a spokeswoman for the other main defendant,
Alyeska Pipeline Co., said the materials reviewed during discovery
should be protected until the court decides they can be entered as
evidence.
   ``We rely on the court's judgment to balance the interest of the
litigants with those of the public,'' Isaacs said.
   Alyeska is owned by seven oil companies, including Exxon, that
own the trans-Alaska oil pipeline and pump about 2 million barrels
of oil a day to the Valdez tanker terminals and into tankers. The
Exxon Valdez was loaded there.
   Plaintiffs include fishermen, tourism companies, environmental
groups and the state of Alaska, which wants to prove Exxon and
Alyeska were negligent in preparing for and responding to the spill.

<HEAD>Pope's Sixth Trip to Africa Taking Him to Impoverished Sub-Sahara</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CIDADE DA PRAIA, Cape Verde (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II travels to
Africa for the sixth time to focus attention on one of the world's
poorest regions, a decade after his first visit to sub-Saharan
Africa.
   When the pontiff arrives in Cape Verde on Thursday to begin his
eight-day, five-nation trip, he will be welcomed by a country of
Roman Catholics living in peace and relative prosperity.
   But this 10-island nation is not typical of the region, John
Paul will face the more familiar African problems of poverty,
hunger, disease, war and political instability in his visits to
Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Burkina Faso and Chad.
   The visit comes 10 years after the pope, during a stop in
Burkina Faso, made an impassioned appeal for saving the region from
hunger, drought and encroaching deserts.
   His plea led to the creation of the John Paul II Foundation for
the Sahel, which sponsors health and agricultural projects in the
region.
   It is the 45th foreign tour of John Paul's 11-year-old papacy.
He made his fifth trip to Africa last spring, visiting four
southern African countries, and plans another African swing later
this year.
   Cape Verde, a former Portuguese colony lying in the Atlantic
Ocean about 300 miles west of Senegal, has the highest percentage
of Catholics of any African country, about 90 percent of the
population of 350,000.
   Ferry boats will transport the faithful from outlying islands
and officials expect at least 50,000 to attend the papal Mass on
Praia's Quebra Canela Beach.
   The government of President Aristides Pereira has spent $600,000
to widen roads for the procession leading to an hillside platform
above Quebra Canela and the harbor, which is already being decked
with posters and banners.
   The country is very poor, but there is no famine and the people
are relatively well fed. The country has flourished thanks to open
economic policies, massive foreign aid, remittances from emigrants,
tourism and isolation from regional conflicts.
   But when the pope arrives Saturday in Guinea-Bissau, another
former Portuguese colony, he enters one of Africa's problem zones.
   Guinea-Bissau, sandwiched between Senegal and Guinea-Conakry on
the Atlantic coast, is one of the world's 15 poorest countries.
Many of its 940,000 people are reliant on international aid to keep
them above subsistence level.
   Bissau's dusty unpaved streets are home to skinny children,
chickens, goats and pigs. Health facilities are poor and dependent
on foreign assistance. The pontiff on Sunday is to visit Cumura
Hospital for leprosy. The disease is one of the nation's main
scourges.
   Only 7 percent of Guineans profess Catholicism. Moslems make up
about a third of the population and more than 50 percent are
animists.
   According to Joao Quintino, director of the state newspaper No
Pintcha, a recent border dispute with Senegal will not stop
thousands of Senegalese Catholics from crossing into Bissau for the
papal Mass.
   On Saturday, the ruling Council of State announced it freed 16
people convicted of plotting a 1985 coup to overthrow President
Joao Bernardo Vieira. Six others convicted in the same conspiracy
were executed by firing squad in July 1986, despite pleas for
clemency from the pope and other international figures.
   Political observers in Guinea-Bissau said the amnesty was
decreed so the west African nation would have no political
prisoners when John Paul arrives.
   The church in Mali, established only 102 years ago, counts about
75,000 Catholics in the predominantly Moslem nation of 8 million
people.
   Mali ranks as one of the five poorest nations in the world, with
an average life expectancy of 45 years.
   The pope is expected to call for reconciliation in Chad, whose
30 years of independence from France have been marred by civil war
and fighting with neighboring Libya. The N'Djamena Cathedral was
bombed during fighting in 1979-80 and has been restored.
   On Aug. 31, President Hissene Habre's government signed an
accord with Libya aimed at ending 16 years of hostilities.

<HEAD>Sculpture Depicting Corporate Ladder Ruffles Feathers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sculpture intended to challenge
perceptions of the corporate ladder has offended office building
tenants who want the artwork dismantled and removed from their
lobby.
   The ``Corporate Ladder'' features a mailman at the foot of the
ladder, a young black man in a business suit near the bottom, and a
woman holding the papers of a middle-aged white man grasping a
briefcase on a middle rung. On the top rung is an older, grinning,
balding white man.
   Sculptor Ed Massey, 26, who spent 3{ months building the 18-foot
sculpture with the help of seven assistants, said it is a social
commentary on corporate life.
   Many of the 35 corporate tenants of Lakeview Office Building
disagree, saying they find the depiction of the woman and black man
insulting.
   Mark Feinberg, president of Consumer First Mortgage, whose
first-floor office looks out at the sculpture, complained in
writing to the building manager that the sculpture shows the
business world as ``mean, cruel, thoughtless and selfish.'' He said
he found it ``distasteful and personally offensive.''
   Some tenants have put up posters suggesting that the sculpture
is in the lobby because the building owners ``couldn't find pink
flamingoes for the lawn,'' said Nanette Wright, who manages the
building.
   Other tenants, such as Padraic Kennedy, president of the
Columbia Association, say the work is ``a fascinating piece that is
bold and dramatic and meant to be satirical.''
   The uproar has led to the cancellation of a reception planned
next month for Massey, of New York City. Building officials now
plan to survey the tenants on whether to keep the artwork.
   ``Ed Massey's intention was to challenge the thinking of
people's perception of the corporate ladder,'' said Ronald C.
Hanser, spokesman for Principal Financial Group of Des Moines,
Iowa, which owns the building and commissioned the sculpture.
   ``It's our policy to decorate our buildings in an attractive way
with pieces of art.''
   Massey said he was disappointed that the sculpture might be
removed, but noted it might be better suited to another location.
   ``Maybe the sculpture will serve the purpose of educating people
in Columbia about art,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Feathery-light fabrics and skin-baring styles
pepped up the runways Tuesday as designers revealed their happy
holiday haute couture clothes for summer.
   The day was a triumph for Emanuel Ungaro, who has been totally
seduced by a light new look. He's simplified his feminine styles to
essentials, using gossamer fabrics and stunning colors to display
his talents.
   This is great news for his fans who found some of his recent
shows overloaded with show-off trimmings and superfluous details.
   ``C'est la vie,'' Ungaro smiled after the show when asked if his
recent marriage had been an influence on his fashion. The
Italian-born couturier, long a Paris fixture, married Laura Fanfani
in November. They are expecting a baby.
   Ungaro's new looks started off with neatly fitted raw silk suits
in shades of bordeaux and chrome yellow followed by bi- and
tricolored light gabardine suits with swirling details in shades
from violet, pink and orange to khaki and some peacock blues.
   ``I was aiming for the elegance of my old master, Balenciaga,''
said Ungaro.
   His remarkable daytime looks included satin-lined short cashmere
coats in sizzling colors topping some beautifully cut and draped
short crepe dresses.
   When it came to dressier clothes, Ungaro followed through
beautifully. His slinky short silk shifts in all colors topped by
floaty mousseline squares were perfect in their understatement.
   Of course, Ungaro had to have some fun with rich fabrics. He
used plenty of heavy guipure lace, draped lame floral fabrics, and
sequined, brocaded jackets or blouses to haute couture advantage.
   Karl Lagerfeld also had a light touch in his show for Chanel,
which won warm praise from the fashion crowd.
   The abbreviated styles were resolutely younger than ever. They
were so short and sweet they looked apt for the junior miss set.
   Lagerfeld continued some of his past Chanel ideas. For instance
the shortie jacket over legs alone became a sort of pretty
coat-dress this time and in fact was cut sexily like a tulip. It
could be worn with a half-skirt or a puff of chiffon.
   These Lolitas often paraded down the runway in long ``Amazon''
or fitted riding jackets with deep decolletes. There were all kinds
of couture details: black velvet cuffs and lapels on the softest of
pinks, black and white raffia piping on many jackets and skirts,
graphic geometric patterns embroidered on a white mini-coat.
   To end it all in grand style, Lagerfeld brought out an array of
short-long evening gowns bathed in clouds of chiffon, sometimes
combined with elaborate guipure lace.
   Louis Feraud turned out a smashing collection of bright,
beautiful clothes showing the creator from the south of France in
top form. He led off with a garden party of emerald and violet
leaf-embroidered short suits with scoop necks, setting a sunny tone.
   Everything was bright and wearable, even the full, iridescent
taffeta garden-party gowns in shades of gold-red with tucks at
bustier and hemline.
   Feraud had lots to put anybody in a good mood. Sportive women
might like the emerald and black gros-grain blazer over a pleated
light satin emerald short skirt.
   A woman dressing for Paris would like the ivory white suits with
a black sunray yoke effect at the neck of a boxy jacket. The
broad-striped pastel linens would be winners for all kinds of
summer moments.
   An ebullient Feraud turned out a rainbow of pastels in crepe
dresses cut in arabesques or swirls topped by huge chiffon shawls.
   It was down to the sea for the end of the show with a gorgeous
line of sequined mermaid flapper dresses and prints in funny fish
motifs.
   All was light and lovely at Philippe Venet, who turned out his
usual superb couture looks _ this time sexier and more colorful
than ever.
   Not known to the masses, Venet is one of the rare couturiers who
owns his own business and makes a living by serving up custom-made
couture to a faithful clientele.
   He led off with lean raw silk outfits piped in satin, perhaps a
strapless dress and fitted jacket in bordeaux and coral setting the
tone for the clothes that followed. He featured some particularly
marvelous suits, scooping out many necklines to daring decolletes.
   The palette was lovely, and full of warm tones like tangerine,
peach, almond green, lilac and tender pink. But one shouldn't
forget the incomparably lovely iridescent satin and taffeta short
evening dresses with their huge bows and jeweled touches.
   Angelo Tarlazzi, the Italian-born couturier at Guy Laroche since
the designer died last year, went south of the border for his
inspiration. Some suggest he should have stayed there, since the
blouson toppers over narrow minis or ample peasant dresses with
stitched details looked more like ready-to-wear than couture.
   Not even the transparent chiffon-topped evening wear had enough
distinction to give the show cachet.

   Gunmen killed a police officer
as he was making a cup of coffee in his kitchen Monday night, the
Royal Ulster Constabulary said Tuesday.
   Inspector Derek Monteith was hit in the head and died instantly
at his home in Armagh, 35 miles southwest of Belfast, police said.
   No group claimed responsibility.
   The gunmen fired at least five shots from the back yard of the
house through a glass door, police said. The officer's wife and

   Monteith, 35, was the first police officer to be killed in
Northern Ireland this year, and the second member of the security
services. His death brings the overall toll since sectarian and

Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province

   An Air Force maintenance worker
pleaded guilty at court martial today to stealing pilot helmets,
life preservers and other equipment and selling it to a phony
surplus store set up by FBI agents.
   Staff Sgt. Chris L. London, who was arrested in the sting last
year, could receive 171 years in military prison, dishonorable
discharge and loss of benefits. The court martial was recessed
until later in the day.
   The arrest was one of many stemming from the FBI probe, dubbed
Operation Punchout, which uncovered the theft of two F-16 jet
engines from the base. The investigation targeted military thefts
from bases in the West and Southwest.
   London was charged with stealing $67,432 worth of military gear
from 1986 to 1989 and selling it to undercover agents who set up
shop in nearby Roy.
   The stolen items included 42 automatic life preserver units,
pilot helmets, gloves, chin straps and camouflage clothing.
   Nearly three dozen military and civilian personnel have been
charged as a result of the investigation, some in sealed
indictments.
   When the sting was announced last summer, U.S. Attorney Dee
Benson said the operation could eventually result in indictments
against more than 100 people.
   Two Air Force security guards admitted stealing the engines and
will be sentenced Friday in federal court.

   A student truck driver cramming for his
final driving exam discovered he needed to review the chapter on
how to stop without hitting things.
   A semitrailer truck operated by Robert Kernes, 59, of Des
Moines, sheared off a utility pole and wiped out a traffic light
Monday. Kernes said he drove off the road to avoid hitting two cars.
   ``I don't think I got a very good grade on that one,'' said
Kernes, who has been attending the Iowa Truck Driving School of
West Des Moines for three weeks. His final exam, scheduled for
Tuesday, was postponed.
   Kernes and his instructor, John Hutchinson, received minor
injuries and Kernes was ticketed for failure to control a motor
vehicle. Damage was estimated at $10,000.
   Richard Rost said it was the school's first mishap since 1986.
The school boasts more than 100 graduates a year.
   ``We haven't made a decision but I would not say he's completely
flunked out,'' said Rost, a school official.

   Mistletoe may make a good excuse for kissing
at Christmas, but the parasite isn't good for much else and
certainly shouldn't be Oklahoma's state flower, says an arborist.
   Mistletoe robs trees of nourishment, reduces growth and damages
foilage, said Don Massey, owner of CRD Tree Services Inc.
   ``Having mistletoe as the state flower is like having a chainsaw
as the state flower,'' Massey said Tuesday. ``It's good for kissing
under and that's about it.''
   Massey said he wants to drum up support for a change. He said he
doesn't have a replacement in mind, but his efforts will focus on
getting people to realize how mistletoe damages trees.
   ``We have a history of changing names of things to incorporate
new ideas, a new sense of priority,'' he said, listing highways,
stadiums and shopping centers as examples. ``Mistletoe has become
an outdated state flower.''
   Mistletoe has hung in there. It's had official recognition
longer than the state. It was named the territory flower in 1893.
Oklahoma didn't enter the union until 1907.

   His mom says he's a ham who doesn't
understand what's happened, but 16-month-old Andrew Payton Nestler
is a looker.
   The blue-eyed blond with a great smile has won a national
``Cutest Baby Contest'' sponsored by Life magazine.
   Andrew, son of Andrew and Robin Nestler of Pleasanton, was the
readers' choice among 12 finalists picked from more than 20,000
photographs submitted by proud parents and grandparents all over
the country.
   Robin Nestler, 32, said she submitted a snapshot of her youngest
son swinging in a hammock after her neighbor urged her to enter the
contest.
   ``I thought I would never do it,'' she said. ``It seemed
ridiculous. There are thousands and thousands of babies.''
   ``It was close, the final tally was real close,'' said Robert
Pondiscio, a spokesman for the magazine in New York.
   Now she's juggling telephone calls from television talk show
producers.
   A Life reporter and photographer spent two days with the family
and the result is a big photo spread in this week's Life. Andrew,
who was awarded $25,000 in savings bonds, is taking it all in
stride.
   ``He's kind of a ham and likes to climb on things,'' said Robin
Nestler. ``He's just so normal. He doesn't understand what's
happened,''
   But his older sister, 5-year-old Ryan Elizabeth, does. She likes
to follow Andrew around the house calling him ``cutest baby.''
Their brother, 4-year-old T.J., is unimpressed, preferring to ``run
around in a Batman cape and mask fighting crime,'' Robin Nestler
said.

   Twenty days ago Mary Sike was the town's
first woman council president, but after two meetings she has been
eased out of office because of her gender, she says.
   The borough council of this Pittsburgh suburb Monday night
re-appointed Dominic DeRusso president after it voted 6-2 to
re-organize for the second time this month.
   ``They don't want to take orders from a woman,'' Ms. Sike said
Tuesday.
   ``I heard last week that they had made their deals,'' she said.
``They want me out of there because I'm a woman, and they don't
want a woman in charge.''
   Councilman Donald DiVito, who made the motions to reorganize and
to name DeRusso president, declined to explain his reasons.
   DeRusso said it was Ms. Sike's personality, not her gender, that
prompted her ouster.
   He said some council members complained Sike ``wanted to control
everything'' when she assigned committee responsibilities, an
accusation she denied.
   Residents complained of too much fighting and too little
business at meetings. ``There's too much back-biting,'' said Ed
Freeman. ``There's too much name-calling.''
   Mayor Gerald Orsini broke a 4-4 vote Jan. 2 by voting for Ms.
Sike.
   DiVito and two other council members did not attend the
council's meeting Jan. 9. The same three walked out of a special
meeting Jan. 16 following a procedural disagreement with Ms. Sike.

<TEXT>
   Many blacks want William Lozano to spend a long
time behind bars for the deaths of two unarmed young black men that
sparked riots a year ago, but the policeman's backers hope to
persuade a judge to let him stay free.
   Dade Circuit Judge Joseph Farina was scheduled to sentence
Lozano, 31, on two counts of manslaughter Wednesday.
   The suspended officer, free on $10,000 bond, faces from 12 to 17
years in prison under state sentencing guidelines, but could serve
anything from probation to the maximum penalty of 45 years in
prison.
   Defense attorneys say they plan to file an appeal immediately
upon sentencing.
   ``The only just sentence is one that does not cause him to be
placed into prison, and allows him to remain free on bond pending
the resolution of his appeal,'' said lawyer Mark Seiden, who
represents Lozano. ``To imprison him would be a total travesty and
miscarriage of justice.''
   Lozano, having no criminal background before the on-duty
killings, almost certainly would stay free during the appeal, lead
prosecutor John Hogan said.
   Hogan said his sentencing recommendation would be influenced by
potential aggravating factors, including the amount of remorse and
the officer's candor on the stand.
   ``Although Lozano was a highly commended officer,'' Hogan said,
``we have to do a balancing somewhere, and obviously two young
people are dead.''
   Motorcyclist Clement Lloyd, 23, was shot and killed while being
chased by police Jan. 16, 1989. His passenger, 24-year-old Allan
Blanchard, died later from injuries sustained when the motorcycle
crashed.
   The deaths led to Miami's fourth major outbreak of racial strife
in the 1980s, all linked to police incidents involving blacks.
Acquittals of white policemen accused of killing blacks twice
sparked violence.
   Miami had no problems when Lozano was convicted Dec. 7. Police
did not anticipate any trouble after the sentencing and made no
plans to mobilize the entire force, as was done prior to the
verdict.
   ``We're not doing anything differently,'' said Miami police
spokesman Angelo Bitsis. ``It's going to be a normal operation.''
   The streets of Overtown, a mostly black area where the shooting
occurred, were filled with dancing and celebration after the
verdict. The judicial system had finally worked for them, many
blacks said. But the high-profile case didn't end there.
   Many blacks have called for Colombian-born Lozano to receive the
stiffest penalty possible.
   ``I don't know if he should get life,'' said Clemon Gardner,
``but I think he should pay for the crime.''
   There also has been a groundswell of support for Lozano,
especially from the Hispanic community and fellow officers, some of
whom wore black wristbands in solidarity with the convicted officer.
   Carlos Lopez, station manager for Colombian-oriented WOCN-AM,
said that thousands of letters had been received urging the judge
not to send Lozano to jail. The station also collected some $40,000
for Lozano's defense, Lopez said.
   And Lozano's defense attorneys say they've collected more than
10,000 signatures from people urging the judge to free the officer
while he waits out his appeal.
   The sentencing in the emotionally charged case has brought the
court ``numerous pieces of mail,'' but not thousands, said Betty
Pottenger, secretary for Farina.
   ``I've never seen anything like this,'' she said. ``But it's a
high-interest case and there's been that kind of outpouring from
the community.''
   The Miami Times, a weekly aimed at black readers, said in a
recent editorial that the high-profile support of Lozano by some
police officers was ``keeping the racial flames burning and stoking
the fires of revenge while throwing a damper on the possibilities
for reconciliation.''
   It added: ``Remorse seems the furthest thing from (Lozano's)
mind and theirs. And when remorse is absent from a criminal's
behavior, the full force of the law is expected.''
   Willie Sims, crisis coordinator for the Dade County community
relations board, said feelings about the sentencing are more mixed
than they appear.
   ``I've had numerous Colombians tell me this guy should never be
on the police force again, but they can't come out publicly and say
it,'' said Sims. ``You have a segment of the black community
calling for the maximum. Others are willing to take into
consideration he was a city of Miami officer and perhaps he made an
error, and they're willing to go along with whatever the judge
gives out.''

<HEAD>Substance Seized at Noreiga Spot Turns Out Not to be Cocaine</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: New throughout with Pentagon saying substance neither cocaine
nor tamales.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pentagon officials conceded today the military
was wrong in claiming 50 pounds of powdery material found at a
house used by deposed Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega was
cocaine.
   They were unable to say what the substance was, but said it was
not the makings of tamales, as reported in today's editions of The
Washington Post.
   ``What was initially suspected to be cocaine was not,'' said Lt.
Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman. ``It was some other
type of powdery material.'' He later described it as ``some kind of
bonding material'' such as glue.
   Asked about the report that the substance was tamales, Schneider
said, ``I see absolutely no such connection or relationship.''
   Another Pentagon spokesman, Bob Hall, said, ``Clearly the guys
who first saw this stuff did not know what cocaine was. When the
experts checked, they said it wasn't.''
   In retrospect, he added, ``probably you shouldn't be announcing
something. I don't know how this was announced. ...You need to be
very careful, obviously.''
   Hall said he could not identify what the substance actually was,
that he had been supplied with ``less than satisfactory''
information by U.S. military officials in Panama.
   The day after the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion, reporters were shown a
so-called ``witch house'' that was said to have been frequented by
Noriega. Col. Mike Snell, the officer in charge of the area, said
some 50 pounds of cocaine had been found there, along with voodoo
paraphernalia.
   ``People are making a very thorough investigation of all the
evidence that they've discovered,'' Hall said.
   In a dispatch from Panama City, Panama, the Post quoted military
and civilian officials as saying that although 450 kilos of cocaine
and assorted other drugs have been seized since U.S. troops invaded
Panama on Dec. 20, none could be directly linked to Noriega.
   ``It was just a mistake in the confusion of the moment,'' the
Post quoted a U.S. officer in Panama as saying of the earlier
report. The officer was not identified.
   Noriega is awaiting trial in Miami on federal drug-trafficking
and racketeering charges.

   A judge said Tuesday The Washington Post had
fabricated a report that 800 people have been imprisoned for taking
part in the June pro-democracy protests.
   The unidentified Supreme Court judge, quoted by the official
Xinhua News Agency, also said Post's Beijing-based correspondent,
Daniel Southerland, had fabricated information that 10,000 people
had been arrested and that new suspects were being picked up for
joining the pro-democracy movement.
   The Post said it stood by the reports.
   The story involving the arrests was published in July. Another,
published last week, quoted Communist Party sources as saying that
many of the 800 people sentenced had received prison terms of 10
years on charges such as revealing state secrets, disseminating
counterrevolutionary propaganda or destroying state property.
   The story came as the government announced it had released 573
people detained during the bloody crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement in June.
   An official report called their release proof of the
government's lenient treatment toward those who repented their
crimes.
   The judge's criticism came three days after the government
announced new regulations restricting the activities of foreign
journalists and banning them from making reports it believes
distort the facts. Violators face warnings or the loss of
accreditation.
   The judge also said the Post had ``deliberately twisted Chinese
law'' in saying that counterrevolutionary crimes in China are so
broadly defined that the state can imprison anyone who criticizes
the Communist Party or party leaders.
   Mike Getler, the Post's assistant managing editor for foreign
news, dismissed the criticism.
   ``Southerland is the senior U.S. newspaper correspondent in
China. He's been there five years, and we have great confidence in
his reporting and his authoritativeness and no reason to back away
from these stories,'' Getler said. ``The attack on Southerland's
reporting by Chinese authorities contains no actual evidence to
discredit his reports. The initial story on roughly 10,000 people
detained or arrested appeared last July, quite some time ago, and
was attributed to Chinese sources with access to Communist Party
documents.''
   The judge said ``hostile forces abroad'' are not pleased with
China's current political and social stability and the improvement
in Chinese-American relations, ``so they distort reality in China
in an attempt to mislead the public.''
   Chinese sources and foreign observers agree that thousands of
people were arrested throughout the country following the June 3-4
military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing.
   The sources say large numbers of the detained remain in prison
without access to legal advice, cut off from their families and not
knowing if or when formal charges will be filed against them.
   The judge quoted by Xinhua denied widely circulated claims of
secret trials and executions, saying cases from the anti-government
riots did not involve national secrecy and thus were tried openly.

   It was not a case of man bites dog,
but rather a case of dog catcher's dog bites man.
   After the Civil Service Board heard more than four hours of
testimony Monday, it decided to reinstate the city dog catcher who
refused to have her dog quarantined after it allegedly bit a man.
   City officials say animal control warden Diane Weaver's German
shepherd Baby Girl bit a man twice on Nov. 8 on orders from Ms.
Weaver.
   Twelve days after refusing to quarantine her dog, Ms. Weaver was
suspended without pay and put on notice that her superiors would
seek to have her fired from her job of picking up stray dogs.
   The city board Monday reinstated Ms. Weaver, but decided to let
30 days of her 46-day suspension stand because she disobeyed her
supervisor.
   Ms. Weaver, 30, testified that Baby Girl was leashed to a
mailbox when the alleged attack occurred.
   David Colwell, an animal warden that investigates dog bites,
said two witnesses told him that Ms. Weaver had ordered Baby Girl
to attack Carter, who was on a bicycle. He was bit once on the
thigh and once on the calf, Colwell said.
   Ms. Weaver said Carter merely passed off scratches as bite
marks, but Colwell said he was certain the bites were real.

<HEAD>U.S., North Yemen Presidents to Meet in Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NAJI AL-HARAZI</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN'A, North Yemen (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ali Abdullah Saleh left for
Washington on Tuesday for the first U.S. visit by a North Yemeni
leader and is expected to bring up allegations that Israel has a
new military base in the Red Sea.
   Saleh will meet with President Bush later this week.
   Saleh also is to brief Bush about efforts to unify capitalist
North Yemen with South Yemen, the only Marxist nation in the Arab
world.
   Israel and Ethiopia, the only non-Arab nations on the Red Sea,
restored diplomatic ties last year, and Arab diplomats who spoke on
condition of anonymity said there is concern about growing
cooperation between the countries.
   Arab newspapers and some Arab politicians have said that
Ethiopia is leasing Israel an island in the strategic Bab al-Mandab
Strait for a military base. The reports have not been independently
confirmed and Israel does not comment on such military matters.
   North Yemen and South Yemen are hosts to units of Palestinian
fighters who pulled out of Lebanon during Israel's invasion in 1982.
   North Yemen and other Arab powers on the Red Sea, led by Saudi
Arabia, have voiced concern over an Israeli military presence on
their southern flanks.
   The diplomats said Saleh also is expected to press Bush to
restore diplomatic relations with Soviet-backed South Yemen.
   Washington broke off ties in 1969 and the diplomats said the
United States is expected to refuse the request until it is
convinced that South Yemen does not support terrorism.
   South Yemen is one of six countries the United States has
accused of international terrorism and placed under an economic
boycott. The others are Libya, Cuba, North Korea, Syria and Iran.
   South Yemen, strategically placed at the tip of the Arabian
peninsula, provides a major naval base for the Soviets in the
Indian Ocean.
   U.S. officials have been in contact with South Yemen since it
took the lead of other Soviet-backed countries and began leaning
toward reform.
   The reform efforts also have given momentum to unification of
North Yemen and South Yemen.
   The countries have been working for unity for more than a decade
despite differences in ideology.
   In their latest step, they began allowing citizens to move
freely between the nations on Monday.
   The North Yemeni capital of San`a has been designated as the
capital for the united country, and both nations have agreed to
prepare a joint constitution for a referendum by Nov. 30.
   The U.S. Agency for International Development has pumped about
$400 million into North Yemen in the past two decades for
agriculture, education, health and other programs.
   The United States also has given North Yemen $539 million to
help re-equip several infantry battalions, including $400 million
in weapons rushed in to help the nation in border clashes with
South Yemen in the mid-1970s.

<HEAD>Bush Attack Rival Drug Bill</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Combines pvs; trims to shorten</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush today attacked the
anti-crime bill sponsored by the Democratic chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, calling it ``a sheep in wolf's clothing'' that
would make life harder for crime-fighters.
   Bush criticized the rival anti-crime bill of Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., after touring an inner-city Kansas City neighborhood and
meeting with residents who have banded together to drive out drug
dealers.
   Afterward, in a speech prepared for an audience of law
enforcement officials, Bush urged Congress to pass the rest of his
own anti-crime strategy.
   Congress, which returned today from a two-month recess, did
enact much of the president's anti-crime initiative last November,
voting to spend $4.2 billion to expand federal prison capacity,
hire more prosecutors and federal agents and take other measures in
the war on crime. That was $500 million more than Bush had asked
for, according to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Bush is still pressing for passage of the rest of his anti-crime
package, including tougher sentencing for hardened criminals,
restrictions on plea bargaining and the death penalty for drug
dealers who kill police.
   Bush said he wants ``to back up our new lawmen with new laws _
laws that are fair, fast and final,'' including ``an exclusionary
rule designed to protect the truth and punish the guilty and not
good cops who have acted in good faith.''
   Bush's bill would allow good-faith exceptions even if no warrant
were issued for a search later deemed illegal. Under the current
exclusionary rule, prosecutors may not use evidence gathered in an
illegal search.
   The president said he also wants ``habeas corpus reforms to stop
the frivolous appeals that are choking the courts,'' and
``constitutionally sound death penalty provisions.''
   ``But today there's another bill, a Trojan horse, standing at
the gates of Congress,'' Bush said of Biden's bill. ``It looks like
a real crime bill. But in actuality it will be tougher on law
enforcement than on criminals.''
   ``America needs a crime bill with teeth, but this is a sheep in
wolf's clothing,'' the president said.
   Biden was in Chicago and not immediately available for comment.
   A Judiciary Committee aide, who asked not to be identified, said
Biden's legislation mirrors Bush's in many respects, but would ban
``racially discriminatory executions'' and allow good-faith
exceptions to the exclusionary rule only if the illegal search was
conducted with a warrant.
   Biden's bill would also ban the assembly, sale or transfer of
assault weapons. Bush has banned the import of assault weapons.
   In addition, Biden's measure would beef up the federal effort to
stop international money laundering and block a proposed
reorganization at the Justice Department.
   Elsewhere in his speech, the president touted his anti-drug
program, saying, ``Our national drug strategy calls for record
levels of new funding for both education and treatment.'' He did
not offer a dollar amount.
   Earlier, asked on Air Force One if he intended to ``bash''
Congress, Bush replied, ``I'm continuing to extend he hand (to
Congress). ... We're just beginning this session. We're renewing
the spirit of cooperation.''
   The president called House leaders from Kansas City to
congratulate them on the opening of the second session of the 101st
Congress. ``I intend to operate in a cooperative spirit. There is a
lot we can do together this year. I wish you the very best,'' he
said.
   Before the speech, Bush visited a onetime crack house here and
met at the Metropolitan Missionary Baptist Church with members of
the Ad Hoc Group Against Crime, a grassroots group formed in 1977
by citizens alarmed by a series of unsolved drug-related murders.
   The president was accompanied by national drug policy
coordinator William Bennett and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
as well as members of the Missouri congressional delegation. He
left the church for a walk through a drug-prone neighborhood.
   Bush has said nothing other than ``very sad'' about the arrest
last week of District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry on a
misdemeanor cocaine possession charge by FBI undercover agents.
   But NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks said Monday after
meeting with Bush that to many blacks it appears the Barry arrest
was part of a pattern of singling out elected black officials for
``harassment.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh emphatically denied that
government prosecutors have targeted black officials, and said it
would be ``intolerable'' if they did.
   Hooks, interviewed on ``CBS This Morning,'' said, ``I did not
say and am not saying it is a Justice Department plot'' to single
out black office holders for prosecution. But he said there is a
``widespread perception'' that ``may be difficult to prove'' that
blacks are being harassed.
   Hooks said the perception had been fueled by inquiries into the
affairs of black Mayors David Dinkins of New York, Thomas Bradley
of Los Angeles, Coleman Young of Detroit and Richard Arrington of
Birmingham, Ala.
   Bush, Thornburgh and FBI Director William Sessions met with
Hooks and 16 other NAACP officials to hear firsthand their account
of mail bombs and threats directed against the civil rights
organization.
   The NAACP leaders said Thornburgh indicated there were ``some
movements'' toward tracking the bombs that claimed the life of an
Alabama federal judge and a Savannah, Ga., civil rights lawyer.

   The American Red Cross on Tuesday honored a
man who has been sending weekly donations of $1 or less from his
Social Security benefits to the Hurricane Hugo relief effort in
South Carolina.
   Dalbey Marsh, 51, was given a certificate of appreciation and a
South Carolina-shaped Hugo pin, gifts from the Red Cross chapter in
Charleston, S.C.
   The gifts were presented by David Bidwell, disaster chairman of
the Red Cross' Indiana County chapter, at the personal care home
where Marsh lives in western Pennsylvania. Marsh, who is mentally
handicapped, moved to the home 3{ years ago after 20 years at a
state hospital.
   Marsh asked that no reporters be present, said Sally Zellem, a
spokeswoman for the Indiana County Red Cross.
   ``He's a very modest man, and he's been a bit overwhelmed by all
the attention he's received from the media,'' Ms. Zellem said.
   Red Cross officials believe Marsh has donated at least $17 for
Hugo victims, said Lee Ann Barrett, a spokeswoman for the
organization's Charleston chapter.
   ``Mr. Marsh is a symbol of all the millions of people who have
sent in anonymous donations,'' Ms. Zellem said. ``The large gifts
are really impressive. But it's really touching when we received
unmarked envelopes with five dollar bills in them with notes
saying, `I hope this helps.' They're sometimes more touching that
the large donations.''
   Red Cross officials in Charleston had been baffled by the
anonymous contributions until earlier this month, when they
discovered they had been sent by Marsh. His identity was learned
with the help of Dolores Comstock, postmaster of the rural
community.
   Hurricane Hugo ripped coastal South Carolina in September,
claiming 29 lives and causing nearly $6 billion in damage.

<HEAD>Japan Postpones Mission, Hopes to Try Again Wednesday</HEAD>

   Space officials postponed Japan's first
unmanned mission to the moon just 18 seconds before liftoff
Tuesday, but said they will try again Wednesday if they can fix a
technical problem.
   ``This time we are going to the moon. But our objective is not
the moon itself,'' said mission chief Hiroki Matsuo. ``Our
institute is getting into interplanetary missions in the 1990s and
for that we need to refine our technology.''
   Officials said they plan to try again Wednesday after they
correct the problem that forced the delay: a failure in the
hydraulic control system used to move the nozzle of a booster
rocket.
   ``I don't think it is a serious problem,'' Matsuo said at the
oceanside launch site in southern Japan.
   If the hydraulic system is repaired, the launch is expected at
8:46 p.m. Wednesday (6:46 a.m. EST Wednesday).
   A successful flight would make Japan the third country, after
the Soviet Union and the United States, to orbit the moon.
   Though the spacecraft failed to blast off on schedule, its
mission and Japan's broad goals in space make clear that this
country is trying to be a strong competitor in space technology.
   The United States has complained in trade disputes that Japan is
discriminating against U.S. commercial satellites to help build its
own space industry. Japan's government space budget in 1989 was
$1.06 billion.
   The mission received little advance publicity in Japan and
Tuesday's countdown was not shown live on television.
   Dozens of reporters had gathered on a dark hillside several
miles from the oceanside launch site to watch the liftoff.
   If the mission goes as planned, the ``Muses-A'' would be the
first satellite to orbit the moon since the Soviet Union landed the
unmanned vehicle Luna 24 on its surface in 1976. On July 20, 1969,
Americans Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin became the first
astronauts to land on the moon.
   Matsuo said his agency's primary objective is not for missions
to land on the moon. ``We may go to the moon in the mid-1990s. We
have various candidate missions to the moon or to Venus, and we
haven't decided yet.''
   The Japanese hope to use the mission to develop techniques for
an eventual manned lunar flight and exploration of other planets,
said Kuninori Uesugi, an official with the Institute of Space and
Astronautical Science.
   The institute plans to send the Muses-A into a highly oval Earth
orbit that will bring it about 10,000 miles from the moon in eight
weeks.
   It then will release a smaller satellite to go into orbit around
the moon and send data to the larger satellite on temperatures and
electrical fields.
   The red and silver rocket cannot lift much more than the
400-pound Muses-A satellite, but Japan is developing the H-2 rocket
to lift two-ton payloads into orbit, equaling U.S. and Soviet
capabilities.
   The Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest automobile maker,
built the three-stage, 62-ton M3S-2 engine used in the lunar
mission.
   Japan's first satellite was launched in 1970. Muses-A would be
the 13th Japanese satellite in operation.
   Launches are limited to a 90-day period each year because tuna
fishermen near the space center, off the southern main island of
Kyushu, complain the liftoffs are dangerous.

   The medical examiner is trying to determine
whose bones were left on the doorstep of a museum over the weekend.
   A guide at the Henry Shelton Sanford Memorial Library and Museum
discovered the skull and other human bones in two cardboard boxes
as he opened the museum.
   ``It's not certainly something you'd like to find on a Sunday

   Police investigator Mike Horan said the bones were human and
appeared old, with no tissue or blood on them.
   ``There's nothing suspicious about them as far as being involved
in any cult activity,'' Horan said.
   The investigator turned them over to the Seminole County medical
examianer's office for possible identification and disposition.
   ``Many people think museums collect everything,'' Ms. Clarke
said. ``We're always happy to welcome donations of historic finds.
But that I'd rather not find anymore.''

   Sylvester Stallone brings boxer Rocky Balboa
home from the Soviet Union on a real Soviet airliner in ``Rocky
V,'' taking advantage of ``glasnost'' to film the latest chapter of
his pugilistic saga.
   Stallone, whose character battled a Soviet boxer in ``Rocky
IV,'' filmed Monday at the Philadelphia International Airport with
the captain and crew of an Aeroflot jet.
   ``It's amazing because six months ago this was totally
impossible. It's truly astounding,'' Stallone said.
   The Ilyushin 86, which arrived from Moscow on Sunday, was the
first Soviet aircraft used in the production of an American film,
movie publicists said.
   Stallone said some moviegoers misunderstood the message of
``Rocky IV,'' in which Rocky defeated a Soviet boxer. ``The real
story at the end of `Rocky IV' was we can all get along,'' he said.
   ``Rocky V'' is scheduled to be released in November by United

   Former state Sen. Julian Bond must pay his
ex-wife $4,200 per month in alimony for five years under the terms
of their divorce.
   After five years, the amount drops to $3,300, Mrs. Bond's
attorney, Louis K. Polonsky, said Tuesday.
   Bond, 49, filed for divorce from his wife Alice in 1988, a year
after she rocked Atlanta by alleging that her husband and other
prominent blacks in the city used cocaine regularly. The
allegations led to police and grand jury investigations, but no
charges were filed.
   In addition to alimony, Mrs. Bond received a $41,500 lump-sum
payment and assistance in buying a house, Polonsky said.
   Bond, who lost a bitter congressional race to former civil
rights colleague John Lewis in 1986, now is host of a television
talk show in Washington, D.C., and teaches a civil rights course at
Harvard.

   An international conference on Vietnam refugees
opened Tuesday amid signs of a growing agreement that most people
who flee the Southeast Asian nation should be forced to return home.
   But sources at the U.N.-sponsored meeting said there was
disagreement about how and when the controversial forced
repatriations should take place. Thousands of Vietnamese are in
refugee centers in other Asian nations.
   Most refugees contend they are fleeing political repression by
the Communist regime, but nations that have been swamped with
asylum seekers say the vast majority are only trying to escape
Vietnam's poor economy.
   In Hong Kong on Tuesday, about 1,000 Vietnamese boat people
living in tents chanted and marched in the Shek Kong Detention
Center to protest forced repatriations, police said.
   The United States also has opposed the mandatory returns. A
source at Tuesday's gathering, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Britain gave a lukewarm reception to a U.S. offer to drop its
opposition in exchange for a 12-month moratorium on compulsory
repatriations.
   British delegates argued that such a plan would not deter a new
influx of Vietnamese into the British colony of Hong Kong, which
already is crowded with would-be refugees, the source said.
   The source said Canada offered a compromise proposal for a
year-long delay in mandatory repatriation of Vietnamese already in
camps in Southeast Asia, but a prompt return for any new arrivals.
   The source said both plans were being discussed privately by 10
countries, including Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia,
Vietnam and Thailand, and chaired by the Office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
   Government officials at the closed-door meeting declined comment
on the proposals and refused to speculate on the likelihood of
agreement between the 25 participating countries at the end of the
two-day session.
   ``I simply do not know what the outcome will be,'' said Robin
McClaren, head of the British delegation.
   U.N. Refugees Office spokesman Raymond Hall said there were
signs of ``greater flexibility'' than at a meeting in October that
ended in stalemate between Britain and the United States.
   Britain forcibly sent back 51 boat people from Hong Kong in
December. Despite an ensuing international outcry, diplomats
reported growing sympathy for British arguments that, given the
cramped conditions in its camps, compulsory repatriation was the
only option.
   There are an estimated 109,000 boat people in camps in Southeast
Asia, including 56,000 in Hong Kong, according to U.N. figures. The
44,000 boat people who arrived in the British colony after June
1988 are subject to screening procedures to determine they fled
political persecution rather than economic want. The arrivals
before June 1988 were granted refugee status without screening.
   Hall said about 7,000 people have so far been screened in Hong
Kong and only 15 percent of these were accepted as genuine refugees
rather than economic migrants.
   The Bush administration during the weekend dropped its
opposition to mandatory repatriation said returns should be delayed
until Jan. 1, 1991, to allow the United Nations refugees agency to
persuade Vietnamese to go back of their own accord.
   The agency also has softened its position on the boat people.
The new high Ccmmissioner, former Norwegian Foreign Minister
Thorwald Stoltenberg, indicated Friday that his agency would help
monitor mandatory resettlements subject to a ``satisfactory
consensus'' being reached at the meeting in Geneva.
   Since March, 1,100 people have returned voluntarily and another
1,400 are registered to go back, Hall said. All voluntary returnees
receive $50 from the refugee agency and qualify for a year's food
aid from Hanoi.
   Hall said United Nations was ``very satisfied'' with the
treatment given to voluntary returnees by Vietnamese authorities.

<HEAD>Rocky Mountain Region Tops National Average for Personal Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Personal income growth in the Rocky Mountain
region topped the national average for the first time in six years
in the third quarter of 1989, while it slowed in New England, the
government reported Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department also said the Plains states registered
the fastest growth rate, folowed by a 9.1 percent advance in the
Far West.
   The department said Rocky Mountain income in the July-September
quarter grew 8.7 percent over the same period of 1988, compared to
a national growth rate of 8.5 percent.
   It was the first time the Rockies registered above the national
average since 1983 and reflected increasing strength in
manufacturing and mining, the department's Bureau of Economic
Analysis said.
   At the same time, the department said income growth in New
England declined during the third quarter to an 8.2 percent rate
from 8.6 percent rate during the second quarter and 9.6 percent in
the first.
   The deceleration was blamed on slowdowns in the growth of
construction and service payrolls.
   Joining New England with growth rates below the national average
were the Mid-Atlantic region, up 8.4 percent; the Southeast, up 8.3
percent; the Southwest, up 8.2 percent, and the Great Lakes, up 8.1
percent.
   And, because of the effects of Hurricane Hugo last September,
South Carolina posted the first decline in any state's non-farm
personal income growth since Nebraska and North and South Dakota
recorded negatives in the fourth quarter of 1988 at the end of that
year's drought.
   Hurricane Hugo, which hit South Carolina the hardest, also
affected income growth in neighboring states because of extensive
damage to rental properties. Excluding the effects of the storm's
damage, personal income would have increased 9.4 percent in South
Carolina and 8.9 percent in the Southeast region.
   Rudolph E. DePass, an economist for the Bureau of Economic
Analysis, said that automation has replaced much of the antiquated
durable manufacturing and mining infrastructure in the Rocky
Mountain region, making those industries more efficient and
competitive.
   But, he said, New England, which in recent years had built up
defense-related high-tech industries, has been hit by the slowdown
in defense spending. In addition, he said, there is a shortage of
skilled workers in the region because of high-priced housing.
   Nevertheless, DePass said New England still has a relatively
high growth rate compared to other regions.
   The Plains income growth was attributed to rebounding farm
income after the drought and to strong durable and non-durable
manufacturing. In the Far West, the report said, growth reflected
strength in manufacturing, service industries and construction.
   On the other hand, in both the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic
regions, weakness in durable and non-durable manufacturing dampened
growth. Weakness in motor vehicle production in Michigan
particularly affected the Great Lakes region, the report said.
   The Southwest suffered slow growth in payrolls of most major
industries, with advances in service industries slower than in any
other region.
   States with the fastest growth in personal income were: North
Dakota, 16.9 percent; Alaska, 15.3 percent; South Dakota, 13.4
percent; Nevada, 13.3 percent; Washington State and Hawaii, 11.1
percent each; Utah, 10.6 percent; and Minnesota, Florida and Iowa,
10.3 percent each.
   States with the slowest growth, in addition to South Carolina,
were: Wyoming, 5.4 percent; West Virginia, 6 percent; Oklahoma, 6.8
percent; Akransas, 6.9 percent; Michigan, 7.2 percent; Louisiana,
7.3 percent; Nebraska, 7.4 percent; Kansas, 7.5 percent, and Ohio,
7.6 percent.

   Widespread snow in the nation's breadbasket
has raised prospects for the 1990 winter wheat crop, the
government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility reported Tuesday.
   The facility is operated by the Commerce and Agriculture
Departments and reported on crop and weather conditions for the
week of Jan. 14-20.
   ``Precipitation fell in the Great Plains from Texas to central
Nebraska, providing much-needed snow cover and moisture to the
winter wheat crop,'' the report said. ``The moderate temperatures
and moisture were beneficial to livestock producers as they helped
pastures.''
   However, the report added that wheat farmers and fruit growers
were ``concerned that the warm weather will start growth too soon,
leaving these crops more vulnerable to a hard freeze later on.''
   The report said the heavy, wet snow in the plains was the first
moisture of the season for many stressed dryland fields of wheat.

   The federal budget deficit increased $14.64
billion in December, meaning the deficit so far this fiscal year
already has reached more than two-thirds permitted for the entire
year, the Treasury Department said Tuesday.
   Combined with the $55.05 billion October-November deficit, the
imbalance at the end of December totaled $69.69 billion, compared
to a $67.58 billion deficit for the same period of fiscal 1989.
   This means that although the government has a lower deficit
ceiling this year, it has spent 3.1 percent more than it did during
the first three months of fiscal 1989.
   The Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law sets a $100 billion
ceiling for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The 1989 deficit
totaled $152.1 billion.
   However, the December imbalance was 49.4 perecent lower than
November's $28.96 billion and 43.9 percent smaller than October's
$26.09 billion.
   President Bush is scheduled to send to Congress on Monday his
budget for fiscal 1991 that starts next Oct. 1. Sources said he
will propose spending $1.23 trillion that will meet the
Gramm-Rudman goal of a $64 billion deficit that year.
   Revenue last month totaled $89.13 billion, 4.9 percent less than
received in the same month of fiscal 1989. Spending fell 1.3
percent to $103.77 billion. The deficit is the difference between
revenue and spending.
   As usual, the biggest spending categories were for the military,
Social Security and other programs in the Department of Health and
Human services, and interest on the national debt.
   Military spending totaled $27.76 billion in December and $71.50
billion so far this year. It is projected to total $286.89 billion
for the entire fiscal year.
   Social Security payments amounted to $19.91 billion last month
and $59.52 billion for the year. It is projected to total $242.95
billion for the year.
   Other HHS programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, totaled
$15.93 billion in December and $43.56 billion for the year. They
are projected to cost $190.17 billion for the year.
   Interest on the national debt totaled $41 billion in December
and $77.66 billion for the year and is projected to total $254.36
billion for the year.

   ``When I get home with my family, I'll kiss the ground. But it's
a great feeling just walking outside the gate ... feel the ground
and not have any handcuffs,'' he said.
   ``I'm very happy,'' Brandley added. Asked if he was bitter, he
responded, ``I think anyone would be bitter. But after a period of
time, that passes.''
   Earlier today, a judge set bail of $75,000 for Brandley, a month
after an appeals court overturned the black high school janitor's
conviction in the 1980 rape and murder of the white teen-ager.
   Brandley, 38, was a janitor at Conroe High School, where Cheryl
Dee Fergeson was raped and strangled during a volleyball tournament.
   Brandley had contended his prosecution was racially motivated.
His first trial ended in a hung jury. He was convicted in a second
trial by an all-white jury.
   A state appeals court overturned Brandley's conviction Dec. 13,
ruling that the prosecution was marked by ``blatant unfairness.''
It said investigators failed to follow leads, threatened witnesses
and lost evidence.
   State District Judge Lee Alworth today set bail without
opposition from District Attorney Peter Speers.
   Speers said he would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate the
conviction.

<HEAD>Governor Calls On China To Listen To Hong Kong's Views</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hong Kong's governor on Tuesday urged China to
take into account the mounting criticism of Beijing's plan to limit
democracy when it takes control of the colony in 1997.
   ``There's no doubt that ... the drafting on the political
structure has been a disappointment to many people in Hong Kong,''
Gov. Sir David Wilson said after addressing the Executive Council,
part of the territory's executive branch.
   Wilson's statement came a day after Hong Kong's legislature and
executive branch rejected China's plan, saying it had been put
forth with ``total disregard for the wishes of the Hong Kong
people.''
   Many political and business leaders in the territory of 5.7
million also denounced it.
   A committee meeting in the southern Chinese city of Canton
decided Saturday to limit the number of directly elected seats in
Hong Kong's legislature, divide the body into two houses and
further restrict who could hold high office after Beijing takes
over.
   The Chinese-appointed committee is writing what is known as the
Basic Law, the blueprint for Hong Kong's government after 1997.
   None of the six committee delegates from Hong Kong voted for
Beijing's plan, which passed on the support of all 10 of China's
delegates.
   On Tuesday, Sanford Yung, a Hong Kong delegate, called for all
his colleagues to resign in opposition.
   Some senior Hong Kong officials took their concerns to Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher on Tuesday and said after meeting with
her in London that she was seriously considering their proposals to
make the colony more democratic before it reverts to Chinese
sovereignty.
   ``She was very, very interested in our views ... We had a very,
very good exchange,'' said Dame Lydia Dunn of Hong Kong's
policy-making Executive Council.
   A spokesman for Mrs. Thatcher's office, speaking anonymously in
keeping with British custom, said she would ``consider very
carefully'' what they had said.
   Beijing has promised to maintain Hong Kong's capitalist economy
for 50 years after it resumes control.
   But faith has evaporated since Beijing's bloody crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement in June and China's increasingly hard-line
stance following democratic reforms in Eastern Europe.
   Members of Hong Kong's legislative and executive councils are
particularly unhappy with the slow pace of democratization and
restrictions that China will place on officeholders.
   Under Beijing's plan, 18 of Hong Kong's 60 legislators will be
elected in 1997, with the rest being chosen by special interest
groups. By 2003, half of the legislators will be elected by the
people.
   Hong Kong politicians have called for at least 20 seats to be
directly elected in 1991 with substantial increases after that.
   The Beijing plan also says only 15 percent of the legislature
can possess a foreign passport. China earlier had planned to
prohibit top officials, such as the chief executive, from holding a
foreign passport.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Alexander Calder mobile with a $1.4 million
pricetag has been stolen from a gallery, authorities said Tuesday.
   The 30-pound mobile, ``White Flag,'' was stolen at 6 p.m. Sunday
from Perls Galleries on Manhattan's Upper East Side, said police
Lt. Joseph Pollini.
   The gallery owner, Klaus Perls, discovered the burglary Monday
morning.
   Perls, 78, was Calder's exclusive agent for 22 years, until the
artist died in 1976.
   Pollini said the burglars entered the six-story building through
a skylight. ``White Flag'' was hanging by a cable just beneath the
skylight, over a stairwell.
   Pollini said it wasn't clear whether the burglars were just
stealing random objects. There have been about 30 burglaries in the
neighborhood in 18 months.
   The burglars tripped the gallery's alarm. Perls said someone
from the alarm company went to investigate, but failed to notice
that the skylight was open and the mobile missing.
   Pollini said there are 40 to 50 gallery burglaries a year in the
city, averaging $500,000 to $1.5 million per theft.
   Usually, stolen artwork is sold for about 10 percent of its real
value. In comparison, most stolen goods are fenced for one-third of
their value, said Pollini.
   Pollini believes ``White Flag'' is still in the New York area.
U.S. Customs agents are watching for it.
   The aluminum mobile, created in 1962, suspends triangular flags
_ one white, the rest black _ on graceful stems. It is 4 feet high
and more than 8 feet wide, but comes apart for shipping.
   Perls said he has little hope of getting it back.
   Two years ago, burglars stole about 60 objects, including two
Picassos, valued at several hundred thousand dollars, from the
Perls Galleries. About one-third of the items have been recovered,
not the Picassos.

   The number of passengers flying on scheduled
American airlines decreased last year while the number of miles
increased by 2.3 percent, the Air Transport Associations says.
   The trade association said U.S. airlines flew 421 billion
passenger miles during 1989, both in the United States and
overseas. But the total number of passengers decreased slightly to
430 million.
   The number of domestic air passengers were down 1.1 percent to a
total 393 million.
   But international passnger traffic increased by 9.5 percent to
101 billion passenger miles, the association said. Passengers on
international flights increased by 5.2 percent to 36.8 million.

   In 15 minutes of public testimony Tuesday, CIA
Director William Webster gave an intelligence chief's assessment of
troublespots and troublesome issues in the 1990s.
   Highlights of his report to the Senate Armed Forces Committee:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE SOVIET UNION: Domestic troubles will preoccupy leaders for
years. ``Poor economic performance, the Communist Party's
diminishing power and the escalating demands of non-Russian
nationalities will remain serious issues.'' The outcome of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic and political reforms is
still in doubt. A major reversal of his policies ``could only come
with his removal. While this does not seem likely now,'' Soviet
``hardliners'' are worried about ``mounting turmoil and economic
distress.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EASTERN EUROPE: ``By July, free local or national elections are
scheduled to be held by all six of the Soviet Union's Warsaw Pact
allies. ... All face great challenges ... but a return to Stalinist
dictatorships is unlikely.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CHINA: The Tiananmen crackdown has affected the tone, but not
the direction, of Chinese policy. ``More popular discontent and
protest or an open split in Beijing's leadership remain profound
sources of potential future instablility.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NORTH KOREA: ``Our concerns about the military strength and
intentions of North Korea's dictators remain high. The regime there
is isolated, undermined by a weak economy and committed to
reinforce its already formidable armed forces.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PHILIPPINES: The attempted December coup against President
Corazon Aquino is a symptom of ``a continuing threat to her
government.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CAMBODIA: ``Without a diplomatic settlement that constrains the
Khmer Rouge and strengthens the non-communists,'' prospects for a
democratic government are weakened.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MIDDLE EAST: With leaders less able to pit the superpowers
against each other, ``local disputes are now less likely to trigger
East-West confrontation but may be more likely to occur.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ARAB-ISRAEL: ``If the peace process does not advance over the
next several years,'' the Palestinian uprising ``is likely to
become more violent, terrorism will probably rise and Arab pressure
on the United States to impose a settlement will increase.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   IRAN AND LIBYA: They are unlikely soon to abandon their
anti-American stance.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EGYPT AND SAUDI ARABIA: Gorbachev's approaches to these two
countries have given Moscow more access.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   IRAN: Soviet hopes for greater influence could be constrained by
the situation is Moslem Soviet Azerbaijan and other factors.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CUBA: As Fidel Castro becomes more susceptible to the ``vagaries
of world change,'' he is likely ``to respond harshly at home and
internationally and possibly take actions that could confront U.S.
interests.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EL SALVADOR: Marxist insurgents remain a threat.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NICARAGUA: As February elections approach, the Sandinistas have
used their control of government machinery to hamper the
opposition. They have tied up in red tape U.S. aid to the
opposition and independent groups.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PANAMA: The U.S.-installed Endara government enjoys broad
support among the public and in the legislature. The opposition is
fractured. The government's prospects hinge on its handling of a
troubled economy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   OTHER ISSUES:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ OIL: ``Western dependence on Persian Gulf oil will rise
dramatically'' in the next few years. ``U.S. dependence is expected
to rise from about 10 percent (of the U.S. supply) to roughly 25
percent'' in that period.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _WEAPONS PROLIFERATION: Increasing numbers of countries, some
that support terrorism, are building or acquiring missiles. That's
an ``alarming'' prospect; many of the same countries are close to
developing the nuclear, chemical or biological warheads ``that
could turn ballistic missiles into weapons of mass destruction.''
By the end of the decade, four more countries, which he did not
identify, may join the nuclear club.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _TERRORISM: Iraq, Libya and Syria have been less active lately
in promoting terrorism. ``Iranian-supported terrorists are the most
dangerous'' now.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _DRUGS: President Virgilio Barco of Colombia has put 80,000 men
into the fight against ``an increasingly vicious drug industry''
and extradited 13 traffickers since August. In the remote valley in
Peru that produces 60 percent of the world's cocaine, military
action has had little effect. Violence and the need for aid are
likely to grow.

<HEAD>Man Convicted of Rapes He Disclosed in Sex Offender Treatment
Program</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who told counselors at a sex offender
program about his involvement in 12 unsolved rapes has been
convicted in four of those cases despite arguing the statements
were confidential.
   Robert E. McEiver, 37, a former draftsman at Honeywell Inc., was
found guilty Monday of criminal sexual conduct and kidnapping in
four rapes in Minneapolis and suburban Richfield in 1987.
   The Minneapolis man's written confession described three years
of stalking and raping women in St. Paul, Minneapolis, Richfield
and suburban Edina. He wrote it while he was in treatment in a
program which encourages offenders to admit past sex crimes. The
treatment had been ordered for a conviction for a 1986 rape.
   Sentencing is set for Feb. 14. Prosecutor William Richardson
said the county might consider trying to have him committed to the
Minnesota Security Hospital at St. Peter as mentally ill and
dangerous.
   Defense attorney Jerry Strauss said McEiver is considering suing
Hennepin County for violation of his civil rights. Strauss also
said he may appeal the judge's ruling that allowed the confession
to be used as evidence.
   District Judge Robert Lynn ruled that the information would be
admissible at trial because there was no other way to identify the
assailant in the crimes.
   Strauss had argued that admitting it would discourage others
from being honest during treatment.
   But Lynn ruled that the series of rapes committed at knifepoint
carried greater weight than any possible harm to the treatment
program.
   When a probation officer learned of McEiver's admissions at the
program Alpha House in Minneapolis, officials removed him from the
program and turned over the document to police.
   ``I had thought about raping a woman for a long time,'' McEiver
said in the confession. ``I decided I would take a knife with me so
I could do this. One day I did that _ I took a knife and started
cruising.''
   He was convicted of raping a 14-year-old girl while she
delivered newspapers Aug. 2, 1987; kidnapping and raping a
28-year-old woman June 30, 1987; raping a 25-year-old woman on June
28, 1987; and raping a 24-year-old woman on Nov. 8, 1987.
   Richardson said no other charges will be filed against McEiver
for rapes identified in the confession. In some cases, the
three-year statute of limitations has passed, he said.
   In most of the cases, McEiver told of approaching the women from
behind and warning them not to look at him. The confession told of
two rapes in one night during 1987.

   A quarter of the states' Democratic Party
chairmen, asked for their early, early choice for the party's 1992
presidentical nomination, pick Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
   Forty-five of the 51 chairmen in the states and the District of
Columbia participated in a survey by the Washingtonian magazine and
13 of them said they would be inclined to nominate Bradley. The
participants were promised anonymity.
   Bradley, a Rhodes scholar who played basketball for Princeton
and the New York Knicks, won the nickname ``Dollar Bill'' for his
parsimonious ways and wrote an introspective book about his career
as an athlete, is seen as one Northeasterner who is acceptable in
more conservative regions.
   One chairman penciled in the observation that Bradley best could
avoid the taint of ``the party's lunatic left fringe.''
   In fact Bradley drew most of his support away from home.
   The magazine said five of his votes came from the West and three
from the South. And two Southern chairmen named him as their choice
for the vice presidential nomination.
   In the Senate, Bradley is regarded as a serious student of
weighty issues such as tax reform and Third World debt _ and as a
ponderous public speaker.
   Bradley has professed no interest in running. He tells
questioners he is focusing on re-election to a third Senate term in
1990.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo was Bradley's runner up, with the
votes of eight chairmen. Others who drew more than one vote were
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, seven; Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, five;
and Sens. Charles Robb of Virginia and Sam Nunn of Georgia, three
year.
   Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a Vietnam war hero, was the leading
choice for the vice presidential nomination, with the support of
eight chairmen.
   Trailing Kerrey for the No. 2 spot were Gore with six votes;
Bradley and Nunn with four apiece and Bentsen, the Democrats' 1988
vice presidential nominee; Pennsylvania Rep. Bill Gray, Arkansas
Gov. Bill Clinton and Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, each with two
votes.

   A paroled child killer arrested earlier
this month as he sat in a car near the frozen body of one of his
alleged victims was indicted Tuesday in the murders of 10 women.
   A Monroe County grand jury handed up an indictment charging
Arthur J. Shawcross, 44, with 10 counts of second-degree murder.
Shawcross also has been charged with the murder in November of a
woman in neighboring Wayne County.
   Shawcross is to be arraigned Wednesday.
   The food-service worker was arrested Jan. 4 after state troopers
questioned him the day before near the body of 34-year-old June
Cicero, who had been choked to death.
   Monroe County District Attorney Howard R. Relin said a statement
made to officials by Shawcross would be used as evidence in the
trial, but he would not say what the statement was.
   Shawcross moved to Rochester in 1987 after serving a 15-year
sentence for the strangling death of an 8-year-old girl in
Watertown.
   Dorothy Blackburn, the first victim Shawcross is accused of
killing in Rochester, was slain in March 1988. The bodies of the
last three victims were found Jan. 4.
   Most of the 11 victims were prostitutes or heavy drug users.
Many of them were strangled or suffocated and their bodies dumped
near water.
   He faces a maximum of 25 years to life in prison on each count.

   Bruno Karl Blach, a retired grocery clerk
charged with Nazi war crimes, on Tuesday waived his right to an
extradition hearing and agreed to return to West Germany for trial.
   Blach, 70, who has been imprisoned since October, made a brief
appearance before U.S. Magistrate Ralph Geffen.
   ``Mr. Blach, are you making your decision to waive a formal
extradition hearing voluntarily?'' Geffen asked.
   ``Yes, I am,'' Blach said in a calm voice. ``Nobody put any
pressure on me.''
   The magistrate then said he had examined the entire file of
Blach's case, and had concluded that the charges provide the basis
for extradition under a treaty between the United States and West
Germany.
   Geffen ordered the prisoner to be exchanged directly with West
German law enforcement authorities.
   Blach was expected to be taken to Los Angeles International
Airport, where he would be turned over to West German officials for
an overseas flight.
   Blach, a Czechoslovakian native who is a permanent resident of
the United States, lived in the suburb of La Habra until his arrest
in October. He was charged with killing three concentration camp
prisoners during a forced march in April 1945.

   Extremists ambushed a military convoy in
Azerbaijan, killing two reserve soldiers and a woman bystander,
Soviet media said Tuesday. The KGB said the republic was on the
brink of anarchy, and local politicians pushed for secession.
   Radio Moscow said the situation in the Soviet Caucasus, where
Armenians and Azerbaijanis have been battling for 11 days, remained
``very, very tense'' Tuesday.
   It said leaders of Soviet Azerbaijan and Armenia continued
negotiations to end the ethnic violence, but little progress was
reported.
   The death toll rose to 170, including those killed in
anti-Armenian riots in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku and the
clashes that ensued among Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Soviet troops.
   The soldiers, who smashed into Baku to quell the ethnic uprising
Saturday, are ``more and more often being chosen as targets'' by
local fighters, Tass quoted Interior Ministry Maj. Gen. Yevgeny
Nechayev as saying.
   Radio Moscow said ``irresponsible people'' were spreading
anti-army and anti-Russian sentiments through unsigned letters and
anonymous phone calls.
   Soviet TV reported Tuesday night that gunfire continued in some
areas of Baku, and warships remained blocked by militants from
leaving the Caspian Sea city's port.
   Baku Radio, monitored by the BBC in London, said two soldiers
and a woman bystander were killed in an attack on a military convoy.
   Azerbaijan's KGB expressed alarm in its appeal to residents of
the republic for calm, Radio Moscow said.
   ``Azerbaijan is on the edge of the abyss, beyond which lie chaos
and anarchy,'' the KGB warned. The public appeal was virtually
unprecedented for the usually secretive state security agency.
   Azerbaijani activists said sentiment to break away from Moscow
was rising. Jeikhun Mula-Zade, a political scientist, said the
Azerbaijani Communist Party leadership was meeting Tuesday and
Wednesday and would consider a break from the national party, as
Lithuanian Communists did last month.
   In Gyanje, Azerbaijan's second-biggest city, the City Council
demanded the Azerbaijani parliament call a referendum on the
republic's secession from the Soviet Union, according to Lutviyar
Nusibov, a Baku attorney. Azerbaijani lawmakers have already
threatened to do just that if Soviet troops are not pulled out soon.
   In Washington, the Bush administration voiced support Tuesday
for the territorial integrity of the Soviet Union, but it called
for dialogue between Moscow and Azerbaijan, saying peaceful changes
``are a matter for the parties affected to resolve.''
   Baku residents prevented two ships carrying the families of
soldiers stationed in the area from leaving the port because they
thought the Soviets were trying to smuggle out bodies of those
killed in the Soviet assault on Baku, a Soviet spokesman said
Tuesday.
   They apparently thought authorities wanted to claim casualties
were lower than in reality, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov.
   ``Nothing was found in the holds,'' Gerasimov told a Moscow
briefing.
   Soviet troops managed to gain control of most of the
Iranian-Soviet border, stemming the mass crossings by thousands of
Azerbaijanis in and out of Iran, Tass reported Tuesday.
   Radio Moscow accused the Iranian press and the speaker of the
Iranian parliament, Mehdi Karrubi, of ``political blindness'' for
their claims that the Azerbaijani unrest meant a step forward for
Islam, according to BBC monitors.
   Soviet troops also began to unblock roads in the disputed
territory of Nagorno-Karabakh on Tuesday, Tass said.
Nagorno-Karabakh, which is controlled by Azerbaijan but is
populated mainly by Armenians and claimed by both groups, is at the
crux of the region's conflict.
   The explosion into violence of the longstanding hostility
between mostly Christian Armenia and predominantly Moslem
Azerbaijan is considered the worst ethnic crisis President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev has faced in his nearly five-year tenure as Soviet
leader.
   He also faces nationalist unrest in the Baltics, Georgia,
Moldavia and parts of Soviet Central Asia.
   Arif Yunusov, a spokesman for the independent Social Democratic
Group political organization, said Baku, a major oil-refining
center, was paralyzed Tuesday by a general strike.
   The strike and unrest has created ``certain difficulties'' with
extraction and transport of petroleum in the area, said Lev
Churilov, a senior official in the Moscow ministry that handles oil
production. He said he had no figures on the economic damage, but
``so far all extraction is continuing and only one drill team has
stopped working.''
   In Yerevan, Armenia's capital, the Azerbaijani blockade of most
rail traffic into Armenia has left many residents without
electricity, heat and water, Soviet TV said. The republic's TV
station reduced its broadcast hours to save energy.
   Foreign reporters remained barred from the region.
   The total number of Soviet troops fighting in Armenia and
Azerbaijan is reported to be 29,000, including troops, police,
cadets and Interior Ministry forces. The number of militants is
reported in the thousands.

   Profanities uttered by the heavy metal band
Guns N' Roses were heard by millions of TV viewers tuned in to the
American Music Awards and brought a barrage of complaints and an
apology from ABC.
   ``As a policy we can't discuss specific numbers, but I can
acknowledge that we have received many calls during the telecast
and this morning protesting the fact that the program contained
offensive language,'' network spokeswoman Janice Gretemeyer said
this morning from New York.
   Guns N' Roses, with a reputation for raunchy behavior, won two
awards during the Monday night ceremony at the Shrine Auditorium,
one as favorite heavy metal group and the other for best heavy
metal album, ``Appetite for Destruction.''
   The band was cut off in mid-sentence while accepting its first
award when guitarist Slash used a profanity.
   Slash and fellow band member Duff ``Rose'' McKagan stumbled to
stage and draped themselves over the speaker's stand to accept the
second award. They were quickly cut off when they began using
profanities again.
   The three-hour telecast was shown live in the East. The
offensive language was edited out of the tape-delayed West Coast
version.
   ``We regret that last night's telecast of American Music Awards
contained some offensive language,'' Gretemeyer said. ``This has
not happened before in the 17 years that the awards show has been
on the air and we will take precautionary measures to see that it
will not happen in future telecasts.''
   ABC may use a seven-second delay in the future, she said.
   A receptionist at Geffen Records, the band's label, said
telephone lines were jammed at the company's Sunset Boulevard
offices and no one was available for comment.
   ``Live programming leads to spontaneous occurrences and
unfortunately last night's was regrettable,'' Dick Clark, producer
of the show, said in a statement. ``We will take all steps possible
toward preventing a recurrence.''
   Paul Shefrin, a publicist for Clark, said Clark's office had
received numerous calls complaining about the language, but he
couldn't determine how many.
   Five months ago, dick clark productions was victimized by
comedian Andrw Dice Clay when he used a profanity on the MTV Video
Music Awards. The Sept. 6 show was also televised live nationwide
on cable's music channel.
   MTV officials announced afterward that the comic was banned for
life from the cable channel.
   Guns N' Roses has offended before.
   Last year, the sponsors of an AIDS benefit concert in New York
dropped the band from the lineup because of anti-homosexual lyrics
on some of their songs. Among the songs deemed objectionable was
``One in a Million,'' which uses a degrading term for homosexuals
and implies they spread the disease.
   In October, lead singer Axl Rose told a Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum audience he was quitting the band because of excessive
drug use in the group. ``I just didn't want to see my friends slip
away,'' said Rose.
   He later apologized and said he wasn't leaving the group.

   President Samuel Doe warned his troops
they will face firing squads if they harass civilians in their hunt
for rebels along the eastern border.
   Soldiers reportedly have killed scores of people since a coup
attempt Dec. 24 by a former civil servant, Charles Taylor.
   Doe, in an address on state television Monday night, said:
``They (civilians), too, are part of the struggle against these
evil forces.''
   Doe's comments were the first official acknowledgment that
soldiers had harmed civilians, although he did not specifically say
troops had killed people.
   International human rights organizations and Ivorian officials
say at least 200 civilians have been killed.
   Justice Minister Jenkins Scott has said soldiers killed only
armed civilians who attacked them.
   Thousands of Liberians have fled across the eastern frontier to
Ivory Coast to escape the bloodshed, and some refugees say soldiers
indiscriminately gunned down civilians.
   Liberia accuses Ivory Coast of supporting the rebels, a charge
the Ivorians deny.
   Doe said he has sent National Defense Minister Boima Barclay to
Nimba County, where soldiers are searching for the rebels, to warn
troops who harass civilians that they face ``the maximum penalty
according to the uniform code of military justice.'' The penalty is
death by firing squad.
   He also said he has ordered Nimba commander Gen. Edwin Smith to
ensure that troops protect peaceful citizens against rebel attacks.
   Doe appealed to Nimba residents to hunt down rebels and turn
them over to security forces, whom he ordered to pursue the
dissidents ``at all costs.'' The rebels are hiding in thick forests
in the district, Doe said.
   Many wounded Liberian refugees are being treated at two Ivorian
hospitals close to the border, and medical officials warned of
possible outbreaks of disease in crowded villages.
   Ivorian officials Tuesday estimated the number of refugees at
57,000.
   Officials at a hospital in Man town said the staff had been
asked to be on call around the clock.
   Dr. Ipou Kouane, chief medical officer at Danane village, said
several organizations have sent food and medicine, but the hospital
needed more. He said they have only 11 days' supply of rice, a
staple in the region.
   Dr. Seya Mathurin, head of Danane rural health center, warned
there could be outbreaks of communicable diseases even though his
staff has started vaccinating refugees against yellow fever,
measles and other diseases prevalent at this time of year.
   Doe seized power in a bloody 1980 coup from the descendants of
former U.S. slaves who founded Liberia in the 19th century. He
subsequently won election as president in voting widely believed to
have been rigged.

   The Soviet Union warned Iran on Tuesday
about taking action ``behind Moscow's back'' in Azerbaijan, where
the Red Army is trying to stop an ethnic war between Azerbaijanis
and Armenians.
   Radio Moscow said any such actions by neighboring Iran would
have ``irrevocable consequences.'' The official radio broadcast the
message after after 160 members of Iran's 270-seat Parliament urged
the Kremlin to find a peaceful solution.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, said hundreds of people organized by the Association of
Militant Clergymen held a demonstration of mourning in Tehran for
Moslems killed in Azerbaijan.
   Legislator Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, a former interior minister,
accused President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of ordering ``the massacre''
of Azerbaijani nationalists and said the world's 1 billion Moslems
``cannot be indifferent'' to the killings, IRNA reported.
   Most Azerbaijanis, whose historic homeland extends into Iran,
are Shiite Moslems, the predominant religion in Iran.
   ``Any unconsidered nationalistic or religious appeals would be
dangerous,'' Radio Moscow said. ``Brutal and illusory nationalistic
flights of fancy have dragged the people to the brink of the
precipice.''
   Iran has become increasingly concerned about the crisis in
Soviet Azerbaijan. The leadership is torn between protecting the
Soviet Moslems and risking vital economic agreements with Moscow.
   Tehran radio said the legislators wrote a letter to Gorbachev,
read aloud in the parliament, expressing concern about the military
crackdown on Azerbaijani nationalists.
   They urged Gorbachev ``not to be influenced by the conspiracies
of Global Arrogance (a synonym for the West) and the criminal
America, and to deal with the Moslems of the Soviet Union with
compassion.''
   Official Soviet reports have reported more than 170 people
killed in violence that began Nov. 13 with battles between
Azerbaijanis and ethnic Armenians, most of whom are Christians.
   Gorbachev declared a state of emergency and sent troops and
tanks into the Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, on Saturday.
   A statement Sunday by Iran's Foreign Ministry said ``imperialist
governments and the Zionist-controlled media'' were distorting
events in Azerbaijan, portraying Moslem Azerbaijanis as
belligerents attacking helpless Armenians.
   The letter from legislators said, ``The Moslems of Soviet
Azerbaijan, by protesting in their cities and gathering on the
Iranian border ... are demonstrating their desire to return to the
fold of Islam, and regain their lost identity.''
   It said Moslems in Iran were ``extremely worried about these
events,'' and, ``together with the rest of the world's Moslems, we
... express our deep regret about the grief and hardship inflicted
on the Moslems of Soviet Azerbaijan.''
   Parliament speaker Mahdi Karrubi, who advocates Iran's
revolutionary brand of Islam, condemned the military action in
remarks Sunday and said it could ``create more problems for the
Soviet Union.''
   He clearly was referring to the potential for unrest in other
southern Moslem republics of the Soviet Union.
   On Tuesday, Radio Moscow called for restraint by Iran and
accused Karrubi of ``political blindness.''
   The broadcast by its Farsi language service said: ``Most Iranian
newspapers have interpreted the actions of the extremists as a step
forward for Islam.
   ``What is the reason for this political blindness? Why do
selfish interests blur the vision of individuals so they fail to
see the truth?
   ``Every step taken in Soviet Azerbaijan behind Moscow's back can
have unforseeable and irrevocable consequences. Constructive
efforts make it possible to resolve the crisis through compromise.''
   Gorbachev blames the violence on Moslem fanatics. The Kremlin
has worried for years that the revolutionary zealots who seized
control of Iran in 1979 would try to stir up the Soviet Union's 70
million Moslems.
   Soviet media have accused Iran of supplying arms to Moslems in
Azerbaijan, but Iranian media deny it.
   Thousands of Soviet Azerbaijanis, bound by language, culture and
religion to their Iranian kin, have crossed the border since the
violence began.
   The flood of refugees and strong nationalistic attachments have
caused fears in Iran that passions could be aroused among its own
15 million Azerbaijanis.
   Nationalists in Soviet Azerbaijan agitate for ``Greater
Azerbaijan'' _ an independent, oil-rich homeland for 20 million
Azerbaijanis on both sides of the border. Azerbaijanis lived
together under Persian rule until 1828, when part of their homeland
was ceded to Russia.

   The upstart dance music duo Milli Vanilli and
country crooner Randy Travis topped the 17th annual American Music
Awards with three trophies each.
   Janet Jackson, Bobby Brown, Paula Abdul, M.C. Hammer, New Kids
On The Block and Guns N' Roses won two awards each.
   During the awards show, police said, thieves entered Miss
Abdul's Studio City apartment and stole jewelry estimated to be
worth more than $3,400.
   Nominees were compiled from year-end charts in the music
industry trade publication Cash Box. Winners were selected by
20,000 members of the public chosen on the basis of age, sex,
geographic location and ethnicity.
   Two members of Guns N' Roses, a Los Angeles-based heavy metal
group, used obscenities while accepting their awards. The
three-hour show was broadcast live Monday night on ABC-TV, and
viewers on the East Coast and Midwest heard the vulgarities, which
were edited out of the tape-delayed West Coast broadcast.
   The band was cut off mid-sentence while accepting its first
award when guitarist Slash used an obscenity. Slash and band member
Duff ``Rose'' McKagan stumbled to the stage to accept the second
award and were quickly cut off when they began using obscenities
again.
   ABC apologized to viewers today, and said it was reviewing how
the show would be broadcast in the future.
   The network claimed a 34 share or percentage of the audience for
the evening, but the Nielsen rating points were not yet available
to determine how many households were tuned in to the show.
   Milli Vanilli, an international duo with a lively pop sound
capitalizing on dance trends crossing different music styles, beat
stiff competition during the show at the Shrine Auditorium.
   The duo won favorite new pop-rock artist over critically
acclaimed rockers Living Colour and the all-star collaboration of
The Traveling Wilburys.
   They also upstaged Bon Jovi's ``I'll Be There For You'' and
Gloria Estefan's ``Don't Wanna Lose You'' to win the pop-rock
single trophy with ``Girl You Know It's True.''
   Milli Vanilli, also the favorite new soul-rhythm &amp; blues artist,
dedicated their crystal obelisk trophies to the stirrings of
freedom in Eastern Europe.
   ``We want to say that this is a symbol of freedom and peace in
the world and for East and West Germany,'' Rob Pilatus, a member of
the duo and a native West German, said backstage.
   Travis claimed all three awards in the country category,
defeating George Strait and Hank Williams Jr. for favorite male
vocalist and besting Alabama's ``If I Had You'' and Strait's
``Baby's Gotten Good at Goodbye'' for favorite single with his
``Deeper Than The Holler.''
   Travis' ``Old 8 X 10'' LP was the favorite country album.
   Backstage he attributed success to ``trying our best to find
good quality songs.''
   Miss Jackson, sister of pop superstar Michael Jackson, won for
her ``Miss You Much'' single in both the dance and soul-rhythm and
blues categories.
   Miss Abdul, the vivacious ex-cheerleader for the Los Angeles
Lakers, won two of four nominations, female pop-rock vocalist and
favorite dance artist.
   Teeny bop sensation New Kids On The Block won the pop-rock album
trophy for the ``Hangin' Tough'' LP and also were named favorite
pop-rock group.
   ``Not bad for five boys from Dorchester,'' said member Donny
Wahlberg as the Boston-based New Kids stood on stage for their
album award.
   ``Appetite for Destruction'' gave Guns N' Roses the heavy metal
album award. The group also was the favorite heavy metal artist.
Favorite rap artist M.C. Hammer's ``Let's Get It Started'' was the
top rap album.
   Up against the fancy footwork of De La Soul and equally mobile
Soul II Soul, the less flashy Tone Loc claimed favorite new dance
artist.
   Brown, whose slick and sexy vocals earned him five nominations,
won two: male pop-rock vocalist and favorite soul-R&amp;B album for
``Don't Be Cruel.''
   Young M.C. claimed the favorite new rap artist award.
   In other country music awards, Alabama was the favorite group,
Clint Black won the new artist trophy and Reba McEntire won female
vocalist.
   Luther Vandross beat Brown and rock superstar Prince for
soul-R&amp;B male vocalist, and Anita Baker won female vocalist in that
category.
   Skid Row captured the award for new heavy metal band.
   Prince won a special achievement award for influencing ``the
look and sounds of the 1980s'' through writing, performing,
recording and movies.
   Singer and songwriter Neil Diamond received a special merit
award recognizing ``outstanding contributions over a long period of
time, to the musical entertainment of the American public.''

<HEAD>Two Senators Claim Plane Is Worth Weight in Gold</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Claiming the B-2 stealth bomber will cost its
weight in gold, two Democratic senators introduced legislation
Tuesday that would end production of the radar-evading aircraft.
   Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Alan Cranston of California said
their bill, which mirrors legislation they introduced last
November, would prohibit all spending on the aircraft beyond the 15
now in production by Northrop Corp. in Cranston's home state.
   The introduction of the bill marks ``the beginning of a
sustained national campaign to give history's first $1 billion
bomber a speedy _ and as far as the taxpayers are concerned _ a
merciful death,'' Cranston told reporters at a news conference.
   The lawmakers acknowledged, however, that the measure faces an
uphill fight. The bill introduced in November during a late-night
session on the defense spending measure won just 29 votes in the
Senate, and Cranston and Leahy estimate that they have about 32
supporters this year.
   Air Force plans for 132 of the bat-winged aircraft came under
attack last year as lawmakers expressed sticker shock over the
single-plane cost of about $530 million.
   Cranston and Leahy complained that this estimate was too small _
that the Defense Department omitted operation and maintenance
expense over the life of the plane and failed to recognize that
cost increases that plagued the B-1B likely will befall the B-2.
   ``It now is a billion-dollar-plus bomber,'' Cranston said. ``It
does cost its weight in gold now and a bit more. Nobody, not even
the Pentagon, would claim it's worth its weight in gold. Certainly
no plane is worth its weight in gold.''
   Cranston based his statement on a gold price of $406.10 per troy
ounce and the B-2's weight of 174,000 pounds avoirdupois. ``Simple
math but crazy logic,'' he said.
   There are 14.58 troy ounces in one pound avoirdupois. Cranston's
gold price price would imply a plane costing $1.030 billion. Gold
prices have been rising lately; at the Tuesday afternoon London
fixing the price was $408.25. That would imply a B-2 worth $1.036
billion.
   The California Democratic proposed using the money earmarked for
the B-2 for housing, drug interdiction, education and the
environment.
   ``Continued excessive military spending heads us toward fiscal
disaster,'' he said.
   Leahy argued that last year Defense Secretary Dick Cheney urged
Congress not to ``nickel and dime'' the B-2 program because that
would only increase the aircraft's cost.
   ``We should kill it outright,'' Leahy said, ``to do otherwise
would be to add to the cost. I come today to bury the B-2, not to
praise it.''

<HEAD>Random Drug-Testing Program Launched at High School</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen high school athletes donned hospital
gowns Tuesday and provided urine samples for the launch of a random
drug-testing program that drew little opposition from most students
and parents.
   ``It wasn't that bad,'' said Megan Mulcahey, an 18-year-old
member of the girls' basketball team who was among the first tested.
   Only 305 students involved in winter sports at suburban
Homewood-Flossmoor High School initially will undergo urine tests,
but officials hope to expand the program to all 1,500 athletes at
the 2,000-student school in the upper middle-class, mostly white
suburb southwest of Chicago.
   ``I don't think it's fair that just us are being tested,'' Miss
Mulcahey said. ``If they're going to go ahead and have that, it
should be everyone.''
   Miss Mulcahey, a senior, said she's sure she'll pass, but she
and several other students said they consider the tests a violation
of privacy that unfairly single out athletes.
   Nevertheless, students involved in such winter sports as
swimming, basketball, wrestling and gymnastics, and their parents,
signed consent forms allowing for the tests.
   ``We really don't feel that we have as much of a (drug) problem
as most schools, but we feel that even if we have one or two it's a
problem we will address,'' Athletic Director Ken Schultz said.
   The Homewood-Flossmoor Board of Education approved the testing
program in September at the suggestion of the high school's
football coach, John Wrenn, who suspected drug use by a couple of
students, Schultz said.
   A few members of the football team voluntarily sought treatment
for substance abuse after the program was announced but before the
testing began, he said.
   Some parents expressed concerns about privacy to the school
board, but the program has generated no campus protests or
organized opposition from parents, Schultz said.
   Amanda Levenberg, a 17-year-old senior and president of the
school's student government, said the tests may help students
resist peer pressure.
   But she opposes them on constitutional grounds.
   ``I was expecting a lot more friction from the student body.
People are complying and they're not complaining,'' Miss Levenberg
said. ``I think it won't hit kids until they have to go pee in a
cup for someone to test them.''
   The winter athletes were assigned numbers earlier this year, and
Schultz picked the first 15 to be tested in a random drawing. All
but one student, who was absent Tuesday, were tested in a school
athletic building, Schultz said.
   Under the program, each student is asked to disrobe in the
presence of a staff member from the hospital that is administering
the tests. They are then handed a hospital gown and provide the
urine specimen in a stall separated by a partition from the
hospital workerr, Schultz said.
   The tests detect the presence of alcohol, steroids and several
other drugs, including marijuana and cocaine. They will be given
once a week, but students won't know when until the day of the
tests.
   Students and their parents will be notified of the results
within 48 hours of the tests, said Principal Charles Smith. Those
who test positive must see a drug counselor within 48 hours.
   Students determined by the counselor to be drug abusers or
chemically dependant will be suspended from sports and required to
undergo treatment. They will be tested again after 30 days and may
return to athletics if they pass, Smith said. More treatment is
ordered for those who don't pass.

<HEAD>Gov't Delays Elections, President Reportedly Rejects Multiparty
System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new government on Tuesday delayed
elections as requested by the opposition and accept U.N. observers
to ensure the balloting is fair, a senior official said.
   The National Salvation Front, which has run the country since
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was toppled, set the
parliamentary elections for May 20 and also said it would run
candidates on the ballot, reversing its previous stand that it
would serve only as a caretaker government.
   There has been opposition from some members of the governing
council and from rival parties to such a move because the grouping
was not formally elected to office and it includes former
Communists, who are equated with Ceausescu's brutal 24-year rule.
   In separate comments bound to raise fears that Romania's
government is not committed to democracy, the Soviet news agency
Tass quoted President Ion Iliescu as saying the idea of a
multiparty system was ``a historically outdated model of
democracy.''
   ``We do not want to follow any model, including the model of
bourgeois democracy in Romania in the '30s,'' Tass quoted Iliescu,
a former senior Communist official, as saying.
   Of political processes in other Warsaw Pact countries leading to
Western-style democracy, Iliescu reportedly said: ``The experience
of our neighbors, countries in which the renewing processes are
also being launched, but in totally different conditions, does not
suit us either.''
   Silviu Brucan, another prominent ex-Communist and senior
government official, told a news conference that Romania would
accept U.N. observers for the balloting to ensure it is fair.
   The council reversed its initial stance that it would play no
role in elections ``in response to the many demands from the mining
workers ... from various (other) workers, students from the
polytechnic insitute, others and intellectuals,'' he asserted.
   Brucan said the delay from April was in response to requests
from new political parties for more time to campaign and was
reached at a meeting of the front Tuesday.
   He was asked if the government had first consulted with the 15
opposition parties, which had suggested dates from June to
September.
   ``It is the right in every country for the government in power
to set the date of the election,'' he replied, citing the example
of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher deciding the date of
balloting in her country.
   ``You can't expect the Romanians to be more democratic than the
British,'' he said.
   When it was pointed out that Mrs. Thatcher headed an elected
government, Brucan argued that the provisional government gained
its legitimacy from the role it played in the popular uprising that
toppled Ceausescu on Dec. 22.
   ``The leadership of the front guided the army in the hot days of
days of Dec. 22, 23, 24, 25,'' he said. ``The legitimacy of the
front derives from its historical role ... This is a very sound
kind of legitimacy.''
   He insisted the front was not a political party, despite its
intention to run candidates.
   Parties are ``organizations with firm discipline to which
everybody adheres,'' he argued, adding: ``The front is not such a
rigid, fixed structure.''
   The decision to have candidates contest the elections was made
despite criticism that the council's high profile and domination of
news media, was a threat to the concept of multiparty democracy.
   It continued a pattern of the front reversing its own announced
decisions.
   During massive anti-Communist demonstrations Jan. 12, the front
outlawed the Communist Party and set a referendum on renewing the
death penalty, only to withdraw the decree banning the Communists
and cancel the plebiscite.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were convicted of ``grave
crimes'' and executed Dec. 25.
   Immediately after Ceausescu's ouster, front leaders declared
they would not play a role in elections, but Brucan effectively
reversed that stance Tuesday.
   ``If the front did not participate in the elections, a political
vacuum would be created,'' he said.
   Asked how the opposition parties would obtain campaign funds and
whether they would be assured time on state radio and TV, Brucan
said this would be discussed at a meeting with the parties on
Saturday.
   Brucan became irritated when a questioner juxtaposed front
participation in the elections _ meant to be the first democratic
voting since the Communists assumed control in 1947 _ with
perpetuation of the Communist Party.
   ``First of all the Communist Party no longer exists,'' he said.
   Brucan said members of the military command would not be front
candidates.

<HEAD>Some Lawmakers Gagging Over Study of What Owls Spit Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers are combing the fields and
forests of Illinois in search of what owls spit up, but some state
lawmakers are gagging over the projected $180,000 cost of studying
the birds' diets.
   ``Apparently the owl was wiser than we were,'' said Rep. Ted
Leverenz, who wants to end funding for the project.
   The researchers involved say their work could provide valuable
information on how changes in the environment affect animals.
   ``They will be the most vulnerable of any of the animals if
there are significant changes in their prey as a result of man's
activities _ habitat destruction, politics, or even natural
changes, climatic changes,'' said Russell Graham, an Illinois State
Museum geologist and bone expert overseeing the study.
   Owls spit up pellets of hair, bone and teeth _ indigestible
leftovers from what they've eaten _ at least once or twice a day.
Since the study began in July 1988, about 3,000 pellets have been
collected.
   The pellets have revealed that owls eat rabbits, opossums,
ducks, pheasants, cardinals, shrews, fish and mice and other
rodents.
   Pam Fortado Gibson, field coordinator for the study, said the
information could eventually be used to help farmers reduce their
dependence on pesticides.
   ``We have no knowledge of our natural pest control,'' she said.
``It would help farmers move away from using carcinogenic chemicals
that pollute our streams.''
   Leverenz believes money for the study should be shifted to the
Department of Conservation's efforts to prevent poaching, according
to legislative aide Mary Riseling.
   ``Maybe it's legitimate, but should it be us paying for it?''
said Rep. Woods Bowman. ``Can't we get the information elsewhere?''
   Carol Knowles, a spokeswoman for the Department of Conservation,
said the department backs the study, on which it has already spent
almost $94,000.
   ``The study is one of the important studies that we carry out to
see if wildlife will be around in future years,'' she said. ``It
has implications for humans, too.''

   Crops produced last year were worth an
estimated $77 billion, up 10 percent from 1988, an Agriculture
Department report said Tuesday.
   Corn topped all crops in value with a total of more than $17
billion, up from $12.7 billion in 1988, said the report by the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board.
   The annual crop values are based on estimated production and
prices during a crop's marketing year. The corn marketing year, for
example, runs from Sept. 1 through the following August.
   Also, the preliminary dollar estimates represent the value of a
crop, whether all is sold or partly used by producers. The figures
are used mainly as comparisons from year to year and do not
represent cash sales by farmers.
   Other leading crop values for 1989 included:
   Hay, baled, $11.8 billion; soybeans, $10.6 billion; wheat, $7.7
billion; cotton, $4 billion; tobacco, $2.4 billion; oranges, $1.8
billion; grapes, $1.7 billion; sorghum, $1.3 billion; and apples,
$1 billion.

   With Azerbaijan on the brink of chaos, the
Bush administration voiced support Tuesday for the ``territorial
integrity'' of the Soviet Union but left the door open for changes
carried out peacefully.
   The parliament of Azerbaijan has demanded the withdrawal of
Soviet troops from Baku, the capital of the republic, and
threatened secession if the demand was not met.
   Soviet troops smashed their way into Baku on Saturday to try to
quell a nationist uprising. The troops have come under fire, at
least 170 people have been killed and the Azerbaijani KGB said
Tuesday the region was ``on the edge of the abyss.''
   The State Department, in a carefully worded statement, did not
refer directly to the threat of secession. It said that ``since
1933 we have recognized the territorial integrity of the USSR,''
referring to U.S. recognition of the Communist state 16 years after
its establishment.
   The statement then went on to say: ``Any changes in the status
of that nation, provided they occur peacefully and
constitutionally, are a matter for the parties affected to
resolve.''
   In an initial statement last week the Bush administration
supported the use of troops to restore order. Since then, the
emphasis has shifted to U.S. support for political expression by
the local people.
   ``We hope to see the early creation of conditions in which a
political dialogue can be undertaken,'' Tuesday's statement said.
``Such a dialogue must accommodate the aspirations of all the
peoples in the republics.''
   It also informed Moscow the administration hoped for a beginning
of talks, as soon as possible, ``that will take into account the
national views and political will of the Azerbaijani people.''
   The statement noted that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
had proposed opening the Soviet political system to greater popular
participation and said repeatedly that the relationship between
Moscow and the republics needed to be reconstructed.

   Conductor Mstislav Rostropovich said Tuesday
he is returning to the Soviet Union for a concert tour next month
with feelings of ``enormous emotion,'' but rejected any notion that
he might end 16 years of exile in the West.
   Rostropovich, music director of the National Symphony Orchestra,
said he and his wife, soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, were happy that
Soviet authorities had ``admitted their mistake'' and decided to
restore the citizenship stripped from them in 1978.
   But Rostropovich made clear during a session with reporters at
the Kennedy Center that the couple had no intention of abandoning
their life in the West and returning permanently to their homeland.
   Rostropovich repeated his assertion last week that ``the almost
16 years spent in the West since our exile do not yet allow us to
change our lives again.''
   Rostropovich is reported to have told friends privately there
cannot be a reconciliation until the Soviets also restore the
citizenship of his close friend, Nobel Prize-winning novelist
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who now lives in Vermont.
   Rostropovich and the National Symphony are scheduled to leave
Jan. 29 for a tour of Japan and the orchestra's first visit to the
Soviet Union, where they will give four days of concerts in Moscow
and Leningrad.
   On the program for the first concert, in the Bolshoi Hall of the
Moscow Conservatory, will be Tchaikovsky's 6th (``Pathetique'')
Symphony, the last work he conducted _ and on the same stage _
before he fled to the West in 1974.
   The Feb. 13-17 concerts will be Rostropovich's first appearance
in the Soviet Union since he went into exile after complaints of
Soviet government harassment and restrictions on his artistic
freedom, including travel curbs and canceled concert engagements.
   Rostropovich says he and his wife were punished for sheltering
Solzhenitsyn in their home for several years in the early 1970s,
after the author had been censured, ousted from the Soviet writers'
union and had his books withdrawn from circulation.
   He said Tuesday he was feeling ``enormous emotion'' at the
prospect of conducting before a Soviet audience again, visiting his
old Moscow apartment, renewing old friendships and mourning fellow
musicians, including composer Aram Katchaturian and violinist David
Oistrakh, who died since he left the Soviet Union.
   ``I never think that in my lifetime I'd be coming back to
Russia,'' Rostropovich said.
   Asked about his feelings, the conductor replied with a question:
``How would you feel about going to the planet Mars?''

   NBC's new comedy ``Grand'' premiered in fifth
place and ``Dear John,'' the show it displaced on Thursday night,
plummeted in the Nielsen television ratings for the week ended Jan.
21.
   ``Dear John,'' in ninth place the week before, was in a
three-way tie for 33rd place in its new Wednesday night time slot.
Its rating fell from 19.8 to 14.1.
   ``Grand'' got a 21.4 rating for its debut. And even with its
rating dip, ``Dear John'' improved NBC's Wednesday night slot,
finishing two ratings points ahead of the show it replaced, `My Two
Dads,'' which moved to Sunday.
   Fox Broadcasting's ``The Simpsons'' and ``Married ... With
Children'' came in ahead of ``Dear John,'' which had been regularly
in the Top 10.
   ``Cheers'' from NBC was first and NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and
ABC's ``Roseanne'' tied for second.
   NBC was first in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey with an average of
14.6 ratings points, while ABC reclaimed second place with 13.5 and
CBS dropped to third with 12.8. A ratings point represents the
percentage of the nation's 92.1 million television homes tuned to a
show.
   NBC leads for the season to date with 14.8, ABC is second with
13.0 and CBS third with 12.3.
   ``Grand,'' from Carsey-Werner Productions, was given the favored
Thursday night position because Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC
Entertainment, said the show needed to be protected and nurtured.
   Tartikoff had said he expected ``Grand'' to get higher ratings
than ``Dear John,'' which had been getting a lower rating than
``Cheers'' in its time slot immediately afterward. He said
``Grand'' would close the gap. He also had wanted to close the
ratings gap after ``Night Court'' on Wednesday by placing ``Dear
John'' there.
   Here are the Top 10: NBC's ``Cheers,'' NBC's ``The Cosby Show''
and ABC's ``Roseanne'' tied, CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' NBC's ``Grand,''
NBC's ``A Different World,'' CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS Sunday
Movie ``The Operation,'' ABC's ``The Wonder Years'' and NBC's
``Unsolved Mysteries.''
   ABC's new series ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' was 11th.
When another new ABC show, ``Elvis,'' about the early life of Elvis
Presley, joins it on Sunday night it could mean trouble for its CBS
competition, ``Murder, She Wrote.'' NBC's entries, ``Sister Kate''
and the newly placed ``My Two Dads,'' were at the bottom of the
network show ratings.
   Fox's new animated series ``The Simpsons'' tied for 28th place
while ``Married ... With Children'' was 31st. It's the first time
in many months that another Fox show has been ahead of ``Married
... With Children.'' Fox also got its highest Saturday ratings ever
with ``Cops'' and ``Totally Hidden Video.''
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was first among the evening news
shows and NBC and CBS tied for second. The ratings: ABC 11.8, NBC
and CBS 10.8.
   The lowest-rated network show of the week was NBC's ``Sister
Kate.'' Here are the five bottom network shows: CBS' ``Saturday
Night With Connie Chung,'' ABC's ``Mission: Impossible,'' CBS'
``Tour of Duty,'' NBC's ``My Two Dads'' and NBC's ``Sister Kate.''

   Attorneys for a New York generic drug company
said the company appears to have used false documents to challenge
government action against one of its products, according to letters
released Tuesday.
   The leaders of a House investigations subcommittee, which
released the letters, said it appears the company, Bolar
Pharmaceutical Co. Inc., was involved in a ``criminal cover-up.''
They called for Bolar to remove its generic version of the
brand-name drug Dyazide from the market.
   Dyazide is a widely prescribed high blood pressure medication
made by SmithKline Beecham. Two generic versions of the drug, which
is a combination of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide, were
approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
   Vitarine Pharmaceuticals of Springfield Gardens, N.Y., took its
version off the market last year after it admitted substituting the
brand-name drug for its product in tests required to win FDA
approval.
   Bolar, based in Copiague, N.Y., makes the only other generic
Dyazide. It is the company's largest-selling product.
   The FDA announced last August it was beginning proceedings to
remove Bolar's Dyazide from the market, saying it questioned
whether the product was therapeutically equivalent to the
brand-name drug. The FDA said Bolar appeared to have misrepresented
documentation and data.
   Bolar resisted the FDA action, maintaining that it had not
misrepresented data to the agency and that the Bolar drug approved
by the FDA was the same product found to be bioequivalent to
Dyazide by a testing laboratory.
   Eugene Pfeifer, a Washington-based attorney representing the
Copiague, N.Y., company, said in a letter to the FDA dated last
Friday that ``there is reason to believe that a number of the
documents used to support our Sept. 11, 1989 submission (defending
Bolar's drug) are false.''
   The letter said Pfeifer's law firm, King &amp; Spalding, became
aware of the ``apparent falsity'' during an internal investigation
Bolar authorized the firm to conduct on several drugs.
   Pfeifer was reported out of his office Tuesday, and calls to
Bolar were not returned.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce investigations subcommittee, and Rep. Thomas Bliley Jr. of
Virginia, ranking Republican on the panel, said ``there can be no
defense of Bolar's conduct.''
   They said they will ask the Justice Department and the
Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the allegations.
   Trading of Bolar stock on the American Stock Exchange never
opened Tuesday.
   Dingell and Bliley also asked the SEC to investigate the sale of
150,000 shares of Bolar stock by the company's three top
stockholders around Dec. 18, about a week before the subcommittee
sent a letter to the company.
   The letter, according to a subcommittee source, put the company
on notice that allegations that a Bolar document had been altered
were being sent to the Justice Department.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said ``the agency is still proceeding
with its intention to withdraw Bolar's'' approval to market its
generic Dyazide and the allegations of fraud will be considered
during the proceedings.

   Thirty-seven protesters against U.S. military
aid to El Salvador, including actor Martin Sheen, were arrested
Tuesday as they demonstrated in the Capitol rotunda on the opening
day of the new session of Congress.
   Dan Nichols, information officer for the Capitol Police, said
the protesters were charged with demonstrating within a Capitol
building and unlawful entry. He said the offenses carry a maximum
penalty of a $500 fine and six months imprisonment.
   The arrests climaxed a day that began with an ecumenical prayer
service at a nearby church and included a march to the Capitol by
demonstrators carrying cardboard caskets in protest of killings in
El Salvador.
   The demonstrators in the rotunda knelt, lay down, chanted
slogans and lifted banners protesting aid to the Salvadoran
government and calling for negotiations to end the prolonged civil
war in that country.
   Sheen, who knelt rather than lay, was silent as he was led
handcuffed from the rotunda.
   Others sang, ``We Shall Overcome'' or called out such phrases as
``Stop U.S. aid to El Salvador'' or ``In the name of God, stop the
repression.''
   Some of the demonstrators would not stand and were dragged out
by officers.
   At the prayer service at St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church,
Brother Sean Sammon, president of the Conference of Major Superiors
of Men, said the group's message to Congress ``must be clear and
unequivocal: End all military aid to that country and instead make
all efforts to bring together the different factions.''
   The Conference of Major Superiors of Men is an organization of
leaders of orders of brothers and priests in the Roman Catholic
Church.
   At a nearby subway station, people coming to work on Capitol
Hill were greeted by demonstrators bearing a sign saying, ``U.S.
Tax Dollars Kill Priests in El Salvador.''
   A Salvadoran Army colonel, three lieutenants and four soldiers
have been implicated in a massacre of six Jesuit priests on Nov.
16. Their cook and her 15-year-old daughter was also murdered.
   The killings prompted calls in Congress for a reappraisal of the
more than $1 million Washington supplies daily in aid to the
Central American nation.
   A statement printed with the program for the ecumenical service,
bearing the name of the ``Interfaith Office on Accompaniment,''
said, ``We find our nation's policy in El Salvador politically
manipulative, humanly destructive, economically counterproductive
and morally bankrupt.''
   ``We therefore call upon Congress and the Bush administration to
end the persecution of the churches and civilian communities of El
Salvador by cutting off all military aid to El Salvador, and by
supporting genuine negotiations for peace,'' the statement said.

<TEXT>
   First Lady Barbara Bush paid tribute Tuesday
to Head Start and assured a crowd of program officials and
volunteers ``George Bush knows our children need more.''
   Mrs. Bush, accompanied by Health Secretary Louis Sullivan and
Mary Sheila Gall, assistant secretary for Human Development
Services, briefly addressed a luncheon celebrating the 25th
anniversary of Head Start and then helped cut a three-tier birthday
cake while the audience sang, ``Happy Birthday.''
   ``I've come to talk to you about education, volunteerism,
family, drug abuse prevention, community activism, health care and
competitiveness. Now before you all settle down for a long winter's
nap. I can say it all in just two words `Head Start,' '' Mrs. Bush
told about 500 people attending the Head Start Volunteer and
Community Partnerships Institute Conference.
   Mrs. Bush, presented with a poster and certificate, acknowledged
that ``most think of Head Start as simply an effective nursery
school'' but said the comprehensive program provides the ``main
meal'' of the day for some of the low-income 3- and 5-year-old
participants and the first dental check-up for others.
   Currently, some 1,300 local Head Start programs are serving
453,000 youngsters nationwide. The program provides education,
social, medical and nutritional services and has been widely touted
as one of the most successful educational programs offered.
   The first lady singled out Head Start programs in Hartford,
Conn., rural Pennsylvania, Dayton, Ohio and Kansas City, Mo.
   ``To know Head Start is to love Head Start and we need to know
more. George Bush knows our children need more,'' said Mrs. Bush.
``He has pledged that every eligible 4-year-old should have a head
start in life.''
   President Bush next week will propose a spending increase of at
least $49 million, about 3.5 percent, for Head Start for the 1991
fiscal year, which begins in October, a source told The Associated
Press last month. He then will follow up in his State of the Union
address with a call for ``School Readiness'' of children as one key
national education goal.
   According to documents obtained by the AP, one education goal
will be that ``by the year 2000, every child in America will start
school ready to learn.''
   In a breakdown, the goal specifies that ``all disadvantaged
4-year-olds will have access to preschool programs that help
prepare children for school, every parent in America will be a
child's first teacher and devote time each day helping his or her
preschool child learn and children will receive the nutrition and
health care needed to arrive at school with a healthy mind and
body.''
   ``The administration will show its commitment to the program in
the 1991 budget,'' said Wade Horn, a Health and Human Services
Department official who oversees the Head Start program.
   Horn said Bush last year offered ``the largest single increase''
in the program's history when he recommended an additional $250
million. Budget-cutting efforts reduced the amount to $170 million.
   Bush has been harshly criticized for failing to fully fund the
program. The Committee for Education Funding said the current
appropriation of $1.4 billion will fund less than 20 percent of the
eligible children.
   The committee is seeking $5 billion to fully fund the program
and provide Head Start services for all eligible preschool children.

   A mysterious oil spill that stretched for five
miles along the Mississippi River dissipated before anyone could
identify its source, amount or content, authorities said.
   The bank-to-bank sheen was first reported last week and drifted
about 100 miles south from St. Louis to Cape Girardeau before it
disappeared after three days.
   The spill caused no apparent environmental damage.
   The sheen was first reported Wednesday by a Coast Guard cutter,
said a Coast Guard spokesman, Ensign Brian Ellis.
   The Coast Guard notified the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. Illinois is on the other
side of the river from the spill.
   Ellis said the sheen also was noticed by two other vessels.
Judging from the description of the sheen, the substance might have
been diesel fuel, Ellis said. Even small amounts of oil can produce
a large area of sheen, he said.
   Because of fog, emergency response officials from the state
Department of Natureal Resources waited until the next day to
investigate. While flying over the Mississippi on Thursday,
inspectors saw only occasional patches of a light oil sheen on the
river.
   By Friday, the sheen had been dispersed by wind and water
currents and was no longer visible.
   The oil could have come from a barge, a tow boat, or an
industrial plant, said Scott Holste, a spokesman for the Department
of Natural Resources.
   ``There is a definite possibility that we may never know what it
was,'' he said.

   Billionaire financier Michael Milken was
subpoenaed Tuesday by a congressional committee investigating the
role of junk bonds in thrift institution losses.
   The House Banking Committee voted 31-1 to summon Milken and two
men involved in land deals with Charles H. Keating Jr.'s Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.
   Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said the
appearance of Ernest Garcia and Fernando Acosta would complete
phase one of the panel's probe of Lincoln, expected to be the
nation's costliest S&amp;L failure.
   Milken's testimony would begin phase two, which ``will
concentrate on the extent to which trading in junk bonds and
subordinated debt contributed to the collapse of Lincoln and other
savings institutions.''
   The panel will examine junk bond trading at Lincoln, Silverado
Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver and CenTrust
Savings Bank of Miami.
   President Bush's son, Neil, served on the board of Silverado
from 1985 until August 1988 and regulators are considering action
against him.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision on Tuesday ordered a suspension
of CenTrust stock trading because of what it called misleading and
inaccurate financial reports. The institution also has been under
fire for investing deposits in an expensive collection of oil
paintings.
   When Milken was last subpoenaed by Congress, for an April 1988
appearance before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, he
refused to answer questions, asserting his constitutional right
against self-incrimination.
   He since has been indicted on 98 counts of securities fraud
related to deals he put together while head of the junk bond unit
of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. His trial is expected to begin later
this year.
   A spokesman for Milken declined to comment on the subpoena vote.
   Delegate Walter Fauntroy, D-D.C., was the only committee member
to vote against the Milken subpoena. He did not explain his vote.
   Earlier this month, Garcia refused to testify in U.S. District
Court when called as a witness in Keating's attempt to overturn the
federal seizure of Lincoln.
   According to regulators, Acosta acted as a ``straw buyer'' for
Garcia, who bought a 1,000-acre parcel near Phoenix in ``sham
transaction'' that permitted Lincoln to book false profits.

<TEXT>
   The national Communist Party
congress was suspended Tuesday, after the liberal Slovenians walked
out, and it appeared unlikely to reconvene. A prominent newspaper
said the party was dead.
   Slovenia's delegation left the meeting Monday night and the
party Politburo announced early Tuesday the congress had been
adjourned indefinitely. Slovenian officials said they would not
return to the meeting and the delegation of Croatia, Yugoslavia's
second-largest province, supported them.
   Official media said that meant the party had split, as the
Slovenians had said it would, and the congress could not continue.
A headline in the daily Borba declared: ``The Communist Party of
Yugoslavia no longer exists.''
   The irreconcilable rift occurred between liberals frustrated in
their efforts to achieve reform and conservatives resistant to
change.
   If advance plans had been followed, the congress would have
ended Tuesday with adoption of a document calling for reforms,
including renunciation of the party's 45-year-old power monopoly,
and election of a new leadership.
   Before leading his delegation out, Slovenian party leader Ciril
Ribicic said the congress had rejected the republic's proposals for
significant reforms.
   Tanjug, the official news agency, quoted him as saying Tuesday
it was ``obvious'' the Slovenian party could ``never again be a
part of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in the manner that it has
been up to now _ an institutionalized permanent minority.''
   Deep divisions became increasingly evident after the congress
began Saturday, and bitter debates developed between liberals and
conservatives.
   Most representative of the opposites were Slovenia, the second
smallest republic, and conservative Serbia, the largest.
   As reported by Tanjug, Ribicic said a meeting Tuesday of the
Slovenian party Central Committe in Ljubljana, capital of the
republic, decided ``to temporarily freeze formal relations with the
rest of the Communist Party'' until Feb. 2.
   On that day, the Slovenian party will hold its own conference to
determine a future platform and define relations with the national
party.
   The official radio in Zagreb, capital of Croatia, accused
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia of trying ``to stage a
coup'' in the party leadership. It said delegates loyal to him had
prevented passage of any liberal proposals put forward by Slovenia.
   Earlier this month, Slovenian Communists said the national
organization should become a loose coalition of independent
regional parties. Serbians want a strong central party and rejected
the idea.
   Serbia equates the party with the nation, a diverse federation
of six republics and two provinces in which longtime leader
President Tito was the main unifying force until his death in 1980.
   Slovenian Communists have expressed increasing frustration over
resistance to reform as they prepare for multi-party elections the
republic has scheduled for April.
   Ribicic said his delegation's walkout was tantamount to
establishing an autonomous Slovenian party, Tanjug reported. He
said most delegates from the other five republics felt there could
``not be a Yugoslav Communist Party without one of its national
organizations.''
   After the Slovenians left, Croatian party leader Ivica Racan
asked that the congress be suspended and said his delegation would
refuse to vote if it continued.
   Milan Kucan, a leading Slovenian Communist said Tuesday the
Yugoslav Communist Party could ``no longer be constituted on the
same basis as was valid until now.''
   Premier Ante Markovic, who advocates reform, said he would
propose legislation laying the groundwork for a multi-party system,
Tanjug reported.
   It quoted Markovic as saying the government would pursue reform,
and ``it doesn't matter whether the party reunifies or splits into
different organizations. The state must function and it will do
so.''

<HEAD>Exxon Valdez Skipper Says Feels Terrible About Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT MILTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The skipper of the tanker Exxon Valdez says the
most worrisome thing about his upcoming oil spill trial is that he
is ``sailing into unknown territory'' which must be navigated
without charts or compass.
   But Joseph Hazelwood says he is confident that once the people
of Alaska hear the case against him stemming from the nation's
worst oil spill ``they will agree that this was a tragic accident,
nothing more.''
   ``I feel terrible about the tragedy that occurred up there,''
Hazelwood said in an interview. ``I'd like to get rid of the
misconception that I got drunk, ran the ship aground, and just
shrugged my shoulders and walked away _ because that's just not
what happened.''
   ``It's been a gut-wrenching experience for the people of Alaska,
and for me too,'' he said, chain-smoking Lucky Strikes.
   Hazelwood's trial on charges of reckless endangerment is to
begin Monday in Anchorage, Alaska _ 10 months and five days after
his tanker struck a reef in Prince William Sound, ripped its hull
open and leaked nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil in an area
rich with wildlife.
   It has been alleged that Hazelwood was drunk before the accident
and had left an uncertified third mate in control of the ship.
   Hazelwood, 43, has a history of alcohol abuse and lost his
driver's license in two states because of intoxication.
   He faces up to seven years in prison and $65,000 in fines if
convicted.
   He refused to discuss details of his defense, except to protest
his innocence, and answered questions almost grudgingly.
   ``I've accepted the cards that I've been dealt,'' Hazelwood said
at his attorneys' office in Manhattan. ``I can't wish it away or
think it away.''
   He has received many letters from the public, ``some pretty
nasty,'' he said. ``I think it was more convenient for people to
vent their frustration at a person rather than a corporation or
government entity,'' he said.
   But others have been supportive. Twelve-year-old Jennifer W. of
Hudson, Ohio, wrote that she once thought Hazelwood was ``scum.''
   But after reading a magazine article about the accident, she
believed that Hazelwood probably wasn't drunk; that the third mate
was qualified; that the Coast Guard wasn't monitoring; and that
``you saved many lives and made the spill smaller by keeping the
boat on the reef.''
   His fellow shipmates and other mariners have written to say that
they ``agree that maritime casualties occur throughout the world,''
said Hazelwood. ``The only obvious solution not to have any more
groundings is don't have any more ships.''
   But to Hazelwood, a world without ships is unimaginable. While
awaiting trial, living with his wife and teen-age daughter in
Huntington, on Long Island, he has earned his living lobstering.
   He said he is mindful of the harmful effects of the Valdez spill
almost daily as he works Long Island Sound in a friend's fishing
boat.
   ``I see the pollution on the Sound, the industrial waste, and
its effects on fishing,'' he said. ``I can relate to the Alaskans
and their anguish.''
   Before his tanker ran aground, the longest he had been ashore
since he was an adolescent was two or three months.
   ``I get stark crazy when I am too far from the salt water,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Three American Engineers Remain Under House Arrest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GOLDSMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three U.S. engineers remained under house
arrest Tuesday following a dispute over a destroyed technical
manual, and an official from their company said they had no word
about when the men would be released.
   ``We know nothing about their departure,'' said Len R. Webb,
Lockheed's regional manager for Africa and the Middle East.
   The three, Irving Thrash, Marvin Gambill and Ernest Ruse, were
arrested Jan. 5 and taken to N'Djamena police barracks after they
burned a technical instruction manual on maintenance procedures for
the two new C-130 transport aircraft purchased by Chad.
   They were held in the barracks for 10 days, then transferred to
the Hotel La Tchadienne in N'Djamena, where they had lived for a
year fulfilling the maintenance contract on the C-130s.
   The three have been confined to the hotel grounds while waiting
for their passports and Chadian permission to leave.
   Webb said no charges were ever filed against the men nor were
they ill-treated. Their arrest was due to a ``misunderstanding,''
he said, and their continued detention was due to an
``administrative procedure.''
   No Chadian officials seemed able to give any information Tuesday
night on how long it would be before they could leave.
   ``You must remember they burned their maintenance document,''
said Information Minister Adoum Moussa-Seif. ``That is not in
dispute. But it is very serious. The French colonial power did that
sort of thing when they left Chad 30 years ago.
   ``We did not charge them, but they really should not have burned
the instruction manual to prevent it falling into our hands. It
reminded us too much of the colonial days.''
   The men's argument was that they had no State Department export
license for the disputed manual and there was no Chadian who could
understand it.
   Webb's assistant, Paul A. Lanegger, arranged for an export
license to be issued when he arrived in N'Djamena, and a full copy
of the document has been handed to the Chadians long ago.
   But the three men _ two of them accompanied by their wives _
remained under house arrest in the hotel and armed soldiers and
police patrolled the perimeter.
   However, there were reasons to hope the remaining difficulties
would be resolved to allow them to leave the country before next
Tuesday, the scheduled date of arrival of Pope John Paul II on his
first visit to Chad.
   One official said privately he was sure the government of
President Hissene Habre would not want the Americans still held
when the pope arrived.

   Bills that would fatten most Americans'
paychecks and free billions of dollars in highway funds were among
legislation introduced Tuesday as Congress returned to work.
   Other bills introduced when the second session of the 101st
Congress convened would raise the Environmental Protection Agency
to Cabinet status and ban all spending for further production of
the B-2 stealth bomber.
   Aside from the EPA legislation, most of the bills would likely
have a direct impact on the budget deficit and how the government
raises money.
   The B-2 legislation aims to cash in on the easing of East-West
tensions while giving ``history's first $1 billion bomber a speedy
and _ as far as the taxpayers are concerned _ merciful death,''
said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., a co-sponsor with Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., formally introduced a bill
to reduce Social Security taxes, which are withheld from every
paycheck. Moynihan says Social Security taxes are being used to
make the federal deficit appear far smaller as it it.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas and chairman of the Finance
Committee, has already scheduled hearings for Feb. 5 and Feb. 8 on
the proposal, which has put the Bush administration in the position
of opposing a tax cut.
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., rolled Democratic and
administration tax proposals in one big ball he is calling the Tax
Reform and Competitiveness Act.
   That legislation offers some concessions to the Bush proposal to
lower the capital gains tax, which spurred a host of
counterproposals from the Democrats, including Hollings' own
suggestion of creating a national sales tax.
   The bill also embraces Moynihan's Social Security proposal and
one by Bentsen to restore the tax deduction for Individual
Retirement Accounts.
   The bill additionally earmarks $4.5 billion in state revenue
sharing and calls for $5 billion in tax credits for research and
investment.
   ``On budget and fiscal issues, the political jousting and
one-upmanship, not to mention outright fraud and deceit, threaten
to spin out of control,'' Hollings said.
   This is the fifth straight year that Hollings has introduced
legislation for a value-added tax, as the sales tax is technically
known.
   On another budgetary front, Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev.,
introduced legislation that he said would free over $10.5 billion
in highway money he says is being wrongly held in the federal
Highway Trust Fund.
   The unspent balance represents the accumulated difference
between revenues _ largely from the 9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax _
and federal highway authorizations. Critics say the money is
deliberately underspent to keep the deficit low and provide a
source of cheap money for government borrowing.
   ``Over the last decade, the federal government has used the
money collected by the federal gas tax as a deficit-reduction
gimmick,'' Bryan said.
   Legislation that would elevate the Environmental Protection
Agency to Cabinet status was introduced in both the House and
Senate, with supporters saying they hoped a bill could clear
Congress within several months.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio and chairman of the Senate Government
Operations Committee, said that the EPA needs more clout and higher
visibility in the adminstration because of the importance of
environmental issues in the 1990s.
   As for defense spending, Leahy said in a reference to the
East-West thaw that ``recent events have made the argument against
the B-2 even stronger.''
   His and Cranston's bill would cancel the program except for the
15 planes now in production. Leahy said taxpayers would save $40
billion as a result.
   Cranston, one of the so-called ``Keating Five,'' introduced
legislation that would allow the 23,000 holders of worthless junk
bonds sold through the Lincoln Savings and Loan to sue federal
regulators for approving the sale.
   Cranston is one of five senators undergoing an ethics inquiry
for receiving contributions from Lincoln owner Charles Keating Jr.
and intervening with federal regulators on his behalf.
   Ethics legislation was introduced by Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn.,
whose proposal would prohibit senators from taking honoraria _
basically speaking fees _ and limiting outside earned income to 15
percent of congressional salary. He said the measure would bring
Senate rules in line with those approved by the House last year.
   Other bills:
   _Reps. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., and Joseph Brennan, D-Maine,
introduced bills to increase low-income energy assistance subsidies
after December's unseasonable cold and low inventories sent heating
oil costs skyrocketing 50 percent.
   _Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., introduced a bill she has
been touting since the U.S. invasion of Panama last month that
would remove existing congressinal prohibitions on women serving in
combat.
   _Banks and thrifts that launder drug money would lose their
charters under a bill introduced by Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill. and
chairman of the House Banking financial institutions subcommittee.
   _And Rep. James Trafficant, D-Ohio, contributed to the budget
fray by introducing a bill to repeal the 1985 Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law, which he referred to as ``that turkey that
should be shot down.''

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Outlines Path Bulgaria Should Take</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major opposition leader said Tuesday
that Bulgaria must follow the democratization model of East Germany
and Czechoslovakia rather than Soviet perestroika, because the
Soviet Union faces chaos.
   Zhelyu Zhelev, leader of the Union of Democratic Forces, was
addressing talks attended by Communists, the opposition and other
political and social groups aimed at achieving a national consensus
on the pace and extent of democratization here. The UDF is made up
of 12 independent parties.
   The BTA news agency quoted Zhelev as saying the Soviet Union was
faced with the danger of plunging into a civil war and military
dictatorship.
   ``The Bulgarian restructuring should be modeled after the East
European one, based on the models of ... (East Germany) and
Czechoslovakia _ a model of rapid changes, unlike the Soviet one,''
Zhelev was quoted as saying.
   ``The faster Bulgaria switches to the East European models of
restructuring, the more it will help the Soviet Union make the
reforms irreversible, which will result in the complete
disintegration of the bastion of totalitarian regimes in Europe and
in the world.''
   Zvetla Daskalova, justice minister and leader of the Agrarian
Union, told the meeting her party was opposed to retaining in the
constitution Bulgaria's definition as a ``socialist state.''
   Until recently, the Agrarians were completely dominated by the
ruling Communist Party, but now are showing increasing independence.
   The opposition said the first free legislative elections should
take place in November, not in May as proposed by the Communists
and the Agrarians, to give the newly formed parties time to prepare
and canvass for votes.
   Ms. Daskalova also said the the country's name should be changed
from the People's Republic of Bulgaria to the Republic of Bulgaria,
or simply Bulgaria.
   She said her party does not agree with the Communists that
Bulgaria ``must remain a socialist state'' and said this should be
deleted from the constitution if there is to be a multiparty system.
   The opposition earlier called for removing the constitutional
clause defining Bulgaria as ``a socialist state of the working
class.''
   It also proposed partial elections to Parliament in May but
insisted the main parliamentary elections be held in November.
   Politburo member Andrei Lukanov protested Tuesday the Communist
Party wants May elections and ``any delay would slow down the
entire process of democratization.''
   Lukanov, the chief Communist delegate, raised the possibility of
a broad coalition government after the first multiparty elections,
saying, ``We do not want to cling to power at any price.''
   But Lukanov, as quoted by BTA, suggested the Communists were
opposed to removing Communist political control of the armed forces.
   He said he agreed with Defense Minister Dobri Dzhurov, who
pleaded for a cautious approach to removing politics from the armed
forces because of national security considerations.
   Bulgaria, known for years as one of the Kremlin's most loyal
allies, was swept by reform demands last fall, as was most of
Eastern Europe. Communist leader Todor Zhivkov was replaced on Nov.
10, after 35 years in power.

<HEAD>Court Dismisses Hunger Striker's Drug Conviction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An inmate who has refused to eat since
March to protest his conviction on drug charges praised God Tuesday
after the Michigan Court of Appeals threw out the convictions and
life sentences.
   ``One time more I say, God gives me His blessings. Now, I can
show the people the power of our God is uneualed. He is powerful,''
said Rene Acuna, 37, of Detroit.
   Acuna, who claimed he has lived on spiritual nutrition from God,
said he still will not eat until he is released from prison and can
return home to his long-time companion, Anna Sossa, and his two
daughters.
   ``I keep my hunger strike. That is my decision. I will eat in
the table of my house,'' said Acuna, who now weighs 112 pounds,
down from 180, in a telephone interview.
   The Cuban immigrant insisted he was innocent of charges of
delivery and conspiracy to deliver more than two pounds of cocaine.
The appeals court dismissed the prosecution's contention he was a
lookout for drug dealers and said there was too little evidence to
support his convictions, noting others convicted with Acuna said
they had never heard of him.
   The court declined to order a new trial for Acuna, who is
serving a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole at
the State Prison of Southern Michigan at Jackson.
   ``This has been probably the most gut-wrenching case I ever
handled as a lawyer and the system has worked,'' said Paul
Denenfeld, legal director for the Michigan chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union, which defended Acuna's right to hunger
strike.
   ``We all believed this was simply a person who was in the wrong
place at the wrong time and I think Rene's courageous hunger strike
has vindicated him and we are thrilled. We are just really
pleased,'' he said.
   Acuna's appeal attorney, Michael Schuck, said the ruling does
not mean immediate freedom for Acuna, a self-employed handyman.
   Preparation for Acuna's appeal was shortened, said assistant
Macomb County Prosecutor Michael Suhy, ``because this comedian was
on a hunger strike'' and the appeals court speeded up the case.
   He said he will appeal the decision and oppose efforts to have
Acuna released on bond pending the new appeal because of the
possibility that he would flee, but Acuna's lawyer said he should
reconsider.
   ``We're in a situation where someone's life is on the line. He
has been on a hunger strike about 10 months now and his life is in
danger every day,'' said Schuck.
   ``The man has suffered enough,'' said Denenfeld.
   Acuna has lived on a diet of water and sugar-laden coffee since
March 3 after a Macomb County Circuit Court jury convicted him on
the drug charges.
   His weight had plunged to 106 pounds by Sept. 13, when doctors
began force-feeding him until he reached 125 pounds and Acuna
returned to his hunger strike.
   Sossa, who was appointed his guardian, said she won't sign
papers permitting force-feeding to resume.
   Acuna contended he was convicted solely because he was an
Hispanic who happened to be in an all-white neighborhood when
undercover agents bought drugs from other Hispanics in a hotel
parking lot in August 1988.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Snuff Out Effort to Ban School Smoking by Youngsters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An effort to stop youngsters from smoking
at school was effectively snuffed out Tuesday by cigarette-puffing
lawmakers who said they wouldn't tamper with local school control
over policies.
   Supporters of a bill to prohibit on-campus smoking by elementary
and high school students accused the House Agriculture Committee of
giving more weight to local-control concerns than to the health of
youngsters.
   On a vote of 10-3, the committee rejected sending the measure to
the House floor and took no further action, meaning the bill will
languish in the committee probably for the remainder of the session.
   Some of the lawmakers lit cigarettes moments before the meeting
began, sending up a light haze that covered part of the room. The
committee has been a traditional ally of the tobacco industry,
which produces Kentucky's leading cash crop.
   Kentucky is the nation's No. 2 tobacco producer and the top
producer of air-cured burley variety of tobacco. In 1988, the
latest year for which figures are available, the state reported
tobacco sales totaling $471.7 million.
   While saying they do not condone student smoking at school, some
committee members complained that the measure would reverse state
policy by replacing local option with a state mandate banning
student smoking.
   ``I think it should be a superintendent's decision and not the
state Legislature's,'' said Rep. Ray Altman. ``Why are they asking
us to tell their kids not to smoke when they have that authority
themselves?''
   In 1988, the General Assembly passed a law giving local school
administrators the option of establishing smoking areas for
students.
   Supporters of the bill said anti-smoking policy should become a
state policy, just like curriculum and attendance standards.
   Rep. Tom Burch, a co-sponsor of the measure, said the overriding
issue is protecting the health of children.
   ``Cigarettes kill you,'' he said. ``Do we just feed poison to
our kids from now on? If you're for the health of our children in
the commonwealth, you will support this bill.''
   ``There's a lot of support in the state to make it less possible
and less acceptible for children to smoke,'' said Rep. Anne Meagher
Northup, the measure's other co-sponsor.
   The concern about preserving local control ``seems a little
frivolous,'' when compared with protecting the health of
youngsters, Northup said.
   She said she would introduce legislation that would prohibit
youngsters under the age of 16 from purchasing cigarettes. State
law currently has no minimum age for buying cigarettes.
   In an attempt to do better with the next bill, she said she
hoped that measure would be assigned to the House Health and
Welfare Committee, which might be more amenable to anti-smoking
legislation.
   Wayne Young, executive director of the Kentucky Association of
School Administrators, testified Tuesday the bill's enactment would
free teachers from monitoring designated student smoking areas in
schools.
   ``That's a burden on the school staff that could be eliminated
with passage of this bill,'' he told the committee.
   Various other school and public health groups also supported the
bill.

   Members of Congress returned Tuesday after a
two-month break, and none seemed happier about it than Rep. Jack
Brooks, D-Texas. He was glad to be anywhere.
   ``I'm lucky to be here,'' Brooks told colleagues, describing his
battle with a serious pancreas illness that he said left him close
to death.
   Doctors told him he'd had no better than one chance in five of
surviving it, he said. He accepted the applause of fellow House
members and a warm bear-hug from a Republican, Rep. Silvio Conte of
Massachusetts.
   ``I hope nobody gets it _ not even the Republicans,'' Brooks
said.

   Also glad to be in town was the newest member. Rep. Craig
Washington's friends filled the House gallery to see him take the
oath of office to succeed the late Texas Rep. Mickey Leland, who
died in a plane crash in Ethiopia last all.
   Washington wiped a tear from his eyes and shrugged off questions
about some unpleasantness he'd left behind. One day earlier a Texas
judge had sentenced him to 30 days in jail for contempt of court,
saying the new congressman had left clients ``in the lurch'' while
he headed off to Congress.
   ``It has nothing to do with my service in Congress,'' Washington
said later.
   He did acknowledge he was a bit bothered, however, by the
confusing maze of subways and underground passageways beneath the
Capitol and congressional office buildings.
   ``I'm kind of slow, because I am from East Texas, but I'll
figure it out,'' he said.

   At times it seemed Congress was not just back, but back with a
vengeance. Members competed for the attention of television cameras
with a series of news conferences that kept the House and Senate's
TV studios booked nearly all day.
   At the hour the House and Senate were convening, a half-dozen
House members arrived at the Capitol on bicycle.
   Their environmentally sound trek had run just two blocks _ from
the nearby Rayburn House Office Building _ and was staged for the
television cameras.
   Their point? To call attention to the 90-day countdown to the
20th anniversary of Earth Day, April 22.

   Congressmen weren't the only ones using the occasion to seek
attention.
   Actor Martin Sheen, no stranger to Washington protests, was
among 37 people arrested by Capitol Police for defying orders to
stop a demonstration in the Rotunda.
   They were protesting U.S. military aid to El Salavador. Sheen
and others knelt on the Rotunda floor while six others lay down
covered with sheets _ representing the six people, including four
priests, slain late last year.
   Sheen and the others were charged with demonstrating in the
Capitol and unlawful entry, two charges that each carry a maximum
penalty of $500 fine and six months in jail.

   Some real business was conducted, but only a little. The Senate
immediately recessed for lunch, then met again in the afternoon
while senator after senator stood to talk about whatever was on his
mind.
   The House had planned to take up a resolution honoring the U.S.
soldiers who were involved in the invasion of Panama last month _
but even that seemingly uncontroversial notion ran into difficulty
and was postponed.
   Republicans said they wanted to add an amendment honoring
President Bush, the guy who sent them there. Democrats balked.
   ``Petty, partisan politics,'' charged Rep. Thomas J. Bliley,
R-Va. ``The people expect us to get along and engage in the
nation's business, not engage in petty, partisan politics.''

   House members were eager to vote to override President Bush's
veto of a bill allowing Chinese students in the United States to
remain here _ with Republicans as well as Democrats predicting the
president will lose.
   The vote was put off for a day, but House members gathered
outside the Capitol for the television cameras, in front of a
replica of the Statue of Liberty, dubbed Goddess of Democracy. It
was like the one the Chinese students erected in Beijing before the
tanks rolled in last year.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., solemnly invoked the memory of
Jesus Christ, Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. _ all in his first
sentence.
   Before proceeding, however, the congressmen had to wait while
Capitol Police used bomb-sniffing dogs to inspect the statue from
all angles.
   It seemed a bit undignified for a goddess.
   ``The triumph of bureaucracy over democracy,'' said one observer.

   Congress will override President Bush's veto
of a bill protecting visiting Chinese students in ``a dazzler'' of
one-sided sentiment, the chief Republican Senate vote-counter
predicted Tuesday.
   The first showdown of the newly convened 1990 Congress will come
Wednesday in the House, where Republicans already had conceded they
would not muster more than a handful of votes to support Bush's
position.
   The administration has concentrated its lobbying efforts on the
Senate, hoping to get the 34 votes there that would be needed to
stave off a two-thirds majority vote to override. But Alan Simpson,
R-Wyo., who is supporting Bush, said the president wouldn't get
five votes.
   ``This thing is gonna be overridden, and it will be a dazzler,''
he said.
   However, a GOP source, speaking only on condition of anonymity,
said Simpson was reporting a far closer tally privately and
suggested his rhetoric may be designed to hold wavering Republicans
in line.
   Bush invited Senate Republicans to the White House for breakfast
Thursday to lobby them personally on the bill.
   Bush on Nov. 30 vetoed the bill, which would allow as many as
32,000 eligible Chinese students to extend their stays in the
United States and avoid persecution in their homeland stemming from
last June's government crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.
   The president says he has effectively taken the same action as
the bill _ by executive order _ and that the legislation amounts to
unwarranted congressional meddling.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, dispatched to meet with
Senate Republicans over lunch, said afterward that it was too early
to say how the vote would go, and added: ``We found some support in
there this afternoon.''
   Simpson, while conceding defeat, criticized Democrats for using
the issue as ``a blunt cudgel'' to inflict unfair political damage
on Bush.
   ``Does anyone in the Congress really, truly believe ... that the
president will require students to return home to face persecution?
Come on. For heaven's sakes.'' The veto override is being led by
those ``who would like to scrape a little luster'' off Bush's high
approval ratings in the polls, he said.
   Simpson's prediction came as supporters of the bill sought to
build momentum, putting Chinese students before television cameras
to allege harassment by their country's consular officials in the
United States and to denounce administration policy toward China.
   ``Mr. President, America is on the side of the students who
stood in the square and called for freedom, not the dictators who
called out the tanks,'' said House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo.
   Haiching Zhao, a Harvard biology scholar and an official of the
Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars, said at a
Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing that the bill is necessary to
protect students and help shield them from harassment.
   But in addition, it would help persuade the Beijing government
``that the only way to ensure our return is not through
negotiations with the White House, but through genuine improvement
of human rights in China,'' Zhao said.
   While Bush has taken administrative steps to shield students
from being forced back to China and into unsafe conditions, he
said, those steps offer only tenuous protection and send no signal
at all to the Chinese government.
   As an example of harassment, Zhao said Chinese consular
officials a week ago visited an unidentified California school and
warned students that the pro-democracy movement was ``an outlaw
organization'' and that participation ``will trigger severe
reprisals against the students and their relatives back in China.''
   ``The president has simply made a mistake,'' said Rep. Mickey
Edwards, R-Okla., a member of the House GOP leadership. ``But the
American Congress and the American people stand very strongly with
those people in China.''
   The vetoed bill would affect 32,000 of the estimated 40,000
Chinese students in the United States, those who hold ``exchange
visitor'' visas. Such visas require students to return to China for
at least two years following their time in the United States before
being able to return or go elsewhere. The bill would waive that
requirement.
   If the override attempt succeeds, the Bush administration still
could raise constitutional objections and force Congress to go to
court to enforce its action. The White House regards its action as
a pocket veto and not subject to an override because it came eight
days after Congress had adjourned for the year.

   An autopsy on a homeless man allegedly beaten to
death by a subway passenger showed he suffered fatal injuries to
his head and neck, the city medical examiner's office said Tuesday.
   The victim, still identified only as John Doe, was killed by a
dislocation of his neck and blunt impact injuries to his head, said
medical examiner's spokeswoman Ellen Borakove.
   ``The first injury had the same effect as a broken neck. It's
classified as a homicide, definitely,'' she said.
   Rodney Sumter, 39, remained in custody Tuesday on a first-degree
manslaughter charge while awaiting arraignment, said Colleen Roche,
spokeswoman for Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau.
   According to police, Sumter fatally injured the homeless man by
smashing his head onto the concrete subway platform Sunday night.
Before the attack, Sumter _ who was standing in a Manhattan subway
station with his 3-year-old son _ was verbally abused, spit on and
punched by John Doe, police said.

   A new financial evaluation of the thrift
industry may show that a second installment is needed on President
Bush's $50 billion savings and loan bailout, a senior Treasury
Department official said Tuesday.
   ``It is possible that the $50 billion will prove inadequate,''
Deputy Secretary John E. Robson, the department's No. 2 official,
told the House Banking Committee.
   His testimony marks a subtle shift in the administration
position. Although officials had previously acknowledged they could
not guarantee $50 billion was enough to shut down failed thrifts
through August 1992, they had always maintained they knew of no
reason why their estimate would prove wrong.
   On Tuesday, Robson said Treasury's Office of Thrift Supervision
is compiling a new ``watch list'' of weak S&amp;Ls that ``may indicate
resolution costs beyond the original estimates.''
   At the end of last week, the Resolution Trust Corp., created by
legislation in August to handle failed thrifts, had taken over 342
institutions, disposing of 40 of them.
   It had been expecting to take over an additional 200 thrifts
from regulators over the next 2{ years and Robson acknowledged that
the new watch list, due to be completed early next month, will
likely be bigger.
   ``If we come to a point where we don't have enough funds to
continue, we'll come up and ask for more,'' he said.
   Private analysts and some members of Congress have been saying
for months that the $50 billion will amount to little more than a
down payment on the cost of resolving the nation's worse financial
problem since the Depression.
   Committee members warned Robson that Congress had little stomach
for earmarking additional taxpayer money for S&amp;Ls.
   ``It's quite clear, at least at this point in time, that there's
not a great steamroller moving to appropriate additional funds,''
said Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa.
   Robson indicated that by late February or March the RTC would
need to begin borrowing the first installments of $40 billion to
$100 billion in ``working capital.'' This would be repaid by
selling assets from failed S&amp;Ls and would not add to the $50
billion cost of covering thrift losses, he said.
   Panel members were skeptical, however, saying that the
administration could use the additional borrowing to disguise
whether the S&amp;L problem had grown.
   ``Frankly, working capital is a euphemism for an increased cost
of the problem,'' said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn.
   Robson, however, promised that the administration would
separately account for the working capital.
   Tuesday's hearing was the first of three by the House panel into
the administration's conduct of the cleanup since enactment of the
Bush plan Aug. 9. The Senate Banking Committee is following with a
fourth session next week.
   Robson was representing an administration oversight board that
controls the pursestrings and policy of the bailout. Also appearing
were oversight board members Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board, and Jack Kemp, secretary of housing.
   Resolution Trust Corp. officials, including Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman, are scheduled to
testify Wednesday.

<HEAD>Military Transport Plane Crashes Shortly After Takeoff, 24 Dead</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military transport plane crashed and
exploded in the hills west of the capital shortly after takeoff
Tuesday morning, killing all 24 people aboard, officials said.
   Investigators said fog and rain was probably to blame for the
crash of the Spanish-built twin-engine Aviocar, which was carrying
13 Venezuelan navy men, eight civilians and three crew.
   Rescue officials said the craft, en route to a port on the
Orinoco River, crashed just outside the hamlet of La Sabaneta
(Little Blanket) 15 miles west of Caracas.
   The pilot apparently was able to maneuver the plane at the last
moment to crash in a deserted area rather than strike houses in the
poor neighborhood, according to preliminary reports by Civil
Defense officials.
   The airplane had just taken off from Caracas's Simon Bolivar
International Airport on a flight to Puerto Ayacucho, on the
Orinoco 400 miles south of Caracas. The military personnel were to
serve at an outpost near the Brazilian border.
   ``With the fog in those hills, it must have been hard for them,
even with radar,'' said Antonio Vargas, an official with civil
defense crews working in the clean-up operation.
   A man living nearby said the plane was ``flying low. ... It
didn't sound like motor trouble.''
   Residents rushed to the scene but the flames and repeated
explosions kept them from approaching the plane. Firefighters
quickly extinguished the blaze.
   So far, 19 bodies have been recovered by rescue workers, most of
them burned beyond recognition, officials said. Among the bodies
were two women and a child, presumably military dependents.
   ``We brought three ambulances up here immediately, but all we've
found are corpses,'' said Mercedes Vivas, a doctor with Caracas
firefighters.
   National guard troops, firefighters and police rescue workers
combed the rubble.
   Military and civilian officials are not expected to determine
the official cause of the accident for several days, said Vargas,
but nearly all speculation points to bad weather as the culprit, he
added.
   The Caracas area has been shrouded in heavy fog and rain the
last three days due to an unusual low pressure system over the
area, according to the Observatorio Cajigal, a local meteorological
station.

<HEAD>Premier Says Soviets Agree No Reason for Troops in Hungary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviets agree they have no reason
to keep soldiers in Hungary and negotiations will begin within days
on withdrawing all 52,000, Premier Miklos Nemeth said Tuesday.
   ``I have spoken with Premier Ryzhkov twice in recent weeks and
we agreed that the ... basis for stationing Soviet troops on
Hungarian soil has outlived itself,'' Nemeth told Parliament,
referring to Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov of the Soviet Union.
   ``There are neither military nor political reasons for their
being here.''
   Much of the Parliament session was dominated by the resignation
of Interior Minister Istvan Horvath because of a scandal about
government spying on the political opposition.
   MTI, the official news agency, said the first session of 1990 is
to consider an array of bills and amendments on religious freedom,
the media and selling state assets to private owners.
   In a live telecast, Horvath said the ``dismantling of the old
(Communist) structure is very complicated. ... Reforming the state
security apparatus was left for last. If I am guilty, I am so of
not having been consistent enough in seeing that the changes are
implemented.''
   Jozsef Horvath, head of the State Security Service's internal
department, and Ferenc Pallagi, deputy interior minister and state
security chief, both resigned recently. The Horvaths are not
related.
   Last week, a security service officer said he fed information to
the political opposition about surveillance by his service as the
country prepares for its first free elections in 40 years.
   After the minister stepped down Tuesday, Miklos Haraszti, a
leading member of the League of Free Democrats, said in a telephone
interview: ``Horvath's resignation was inevitable, but we are not
in the least satisfied.''
   He said the security force must be disbanded by an impartial
commissioner, or ``it will be business as usual without the public
knowing who these people are.''
   Nemeth suggested creation of a Parliament committee to supervise
security organizations.
   About the withdrawal of Soviet troops, Nemeth said the Hungarian
armed forces ``are fully capable of defending the territorial
integrity and sovereignty of the country. Hungary's strategic and
geopolitical position makes it possible for the U.S.S.R. to
withdraw its troops at the earliest possible time.''
   He said Hungarian and Soviet experts would meet in Budapest ``in
the next few days.'' The ``withdrawal schedule will be determined''
by technical factors and the Hungarian military's ``capacity to
meet the new situation,'' he told Parliament.
   ``The international situation is favorable and our image of the
enemy has changed,'' Nemeth declared.
   Limited troop withdrawals began last April and 10,000 soldiers
left in 1989. Czechoslovakia and Poland also seek total withdrawal
of Soviet forces from their territory, but there has been no word
on whether Moscow has agreed.

   The director of the Central Intelligence
Agency told Congress Tuesday that Eastern Europe's tumultuous push
for democracy has cut the Soviet threat to the West and that ``we
can probably expect a continued diminution.''
   William Webster, in an unusual public appearance before the
Senate Armed Services Committee, said that as unchallenged
communist control comes to an end in the Eastern bloc, those
nations' links to Moscow have been radically changed.
   The result, he said, is a severe blow to the Soviet Union's
certainty that Eastern Europe will respond to Moscow's military
directives.
   The armed services committee is beginning work on writing a
defense budget for fiscal 1991 with an assessment of the Soviet
threat to the West.
   ``Overall, the conventional threat to the United States and our
alliance partners in Europe has decreased as a result of changes in
Eastern Europe and Soviet force reductions,'' Webster told the
panel.
   The CIA director cautioned, however, that the Soviet Union is
vigorously upgrading its strategic forces.
   Webster cited the Soviets' deployment last year of two new,
silo-based, nuclear missiles; the continued deployment of SS-25 and
SS-24 rail-mobile missiles, and the launching of new Typhoon and
Delta-IV ballistic missile submarines.
   The Soviets also have made considerable gains in the
anti-submarine effort, but they still ``will be unable at least in
this decade to threaten U.S. subs in the open ocean,'' Webster said.
   In what appeared to be a plea to head off budget cuts for the
CIA and other intelligence agencies, Webster said the United States
must maintain its intelligence capability. He pointed to the
continued Soviet strategic modernization and to terrorism; illegal
drugs; uncertainty in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East, and
weapons proliferation.
   Intelligence operations are hidden in the Defense Department
budget, which faces significant cuts on Capitol Hill this year.
Although the exact figures are secret, U.S. intelligence reportedly
spends $25 billion to $30 billion a year, just under 10 percent of
the defense budget.
   In his public statement, Webster emphasized that the situation
in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is in constant flux with
widespread economic problems, turmoil in regional areas and the
Communist Party's reduced power.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is committed to reforms,
but they have been slow in coming, the CIA director said. The
chance of Gorbachev's removal as Kremlin leader is unlikely, and a
major reversal of his policies would come only if he is removed
from power, Webster said.
   Nevertheless, ``we can probably expect a continued diminution _
but not elimination _ of Soviet threats to U.S. interests,'' the
CIA director said.
   A question-and-answer session with members of the committee was
held in closed session.
   The director of the Defense Intelligence Agency agreed with
Webster, telling the committee that the threat of ``deliberate
aggression directed against Europe and its extension to global
conflict is much reduced.''
   Lt. Gen. Harry Soyster said he based his assessment on
developments in Eastern Europe and on Soviet armed forces
reductions in keeping with Gorbachev's December 1988 proposal to
cut troop strength.
   Soyster said that by the middle of the decade, ``independently
developed political and economic relationships will likely lead to
the phase out of the (Warsaw) pact's collective military security
role. A new series of security agreements between the Soviet Union
and East European nations could emerge.''
   The Defense Intelligence director said the fast-moving events
may speed up the removal of Soviet forces and the ``the evolution
toward such a new security order.''
   He also told the panel he believes ``that the Soviets would
consider large-scale theater operations against NATO with only
their own forces as highly risky, if not impractical,'' Soyster
said.
   The hearing marked the first in a series of committee sessions
to assess the Soviet threat. The panel will use that data when it
writes a defense budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
President Bush plans to submit his budget proposal next week.
   ``We've seen the threat change on TV every night,'' Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga. and the committee's chairman, said as the hearing
began.``We'll be looking at this changed threat as the foundation
on which we build the budget which we will be asking the American
people to pay for.''

<HEAD>Poindexter Ordered to Produce Reagan Questions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Poindexter must produce a list of
specific questions he intends to ask former President Reagan at
Poindexter's Iran-Contra trial, a federal judge ordered Tuesday.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene said Poindexter's
request for Reagan's testimony was too broad, encompassing
``wide-ranging subjects'' such as U.S. use of foreign airfields and
meetings between Reagan and the Tower Commission.
   Greene said that ``until such focused questions are submitted''
he will be unable to decide whether to approve Poindexter's request
to subpoena Reagan at the former national security adviser's trial,
scheduled to begin Feb. 20.
   The questions, to be submitted by Monday, will be given to
Reagan and the Justice Department but not to Iran-Contra
prosecutors.
   Poindexter's lawyers argued before the ruling that Reagan is
erecting a smokescreen of legal objections and is engaging in
``graymail'' to avoid testifying in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   Attorneys for the former president say Poindexter must show a
specific need for Reagan's testimony and raised the possibility
that he might inadvertently divulge national secrets while
testifying.
   ``That is basically graymail, your honor,'' said Poindexter
lawyer Frederick Robinson. ``It's a tactic to avoid having to
testify in this case. We think the whole issue of constitutionality
is a smokescreen'' to avoid coming to court.
   Reagan ``has time to go to Japan and write a book; he certainly
has time to come to court,'' Robinson said.
   Graymail is the tactic of trying to inject as much classified
information into a criminal case as possible. The term usually is
used in the context of defense lawyers who are trying to force the
government to seek dismissal of charges on national security
grounds.
   Reagan lawyer Theodore Olson said Poindexter must show the
former president's testimony would be favorable to the defendant
and would be information not available from other witnesses.
   Poindexter has submitted a secret document to the judge saying
he frequently met alone with Reagan.
   Olson questioned that assertion, saying White House chief of
staff Donald Regan and a Poindexter aide, as well as then-Vice
President Bush, were present at daily morning meetings in 1986.
   On another matter, Iran-Contra prosecutors said Richard Secord
is refusing to recant or modify his testimony in the scandal.
   The government and Secord ``continue to be at odds'' over the
truth of the testimony about his profits, the office of independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh said in a court filing.
   The government alleged in an indictment that Secord made more
than $1 million by assisting North's resupply network to the
Contras and the administration's secret arms sales to Iran.
   Secord, who faces sentencing Wednesday, pleaded guilty to making
a false statement when he said he was unaware that any proceeds
from the Iran-Contra scandal benefitted former White House aide
Oliver North. Secord paid for a $13,800 security system at North's
home.
   Secord faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

   ``I won't be doing them ever again,'' Bowie said at a news

   The 42-year-old musician will appear in Canada, Britain and

<HEAD>Medellin Cartel Leader Says He's Still in Control and Wants Peace</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Medellin cartel leader Pablo Escobar
said Tuesday he still was in control of Colombia's most powerful
cocaine trafficking outfit and that it was united in its decision
to seek peace with the government.
   Escobar, No. 1 on the most wanted list, also swore his cartel
would continue a war with a rival organization based in the
southern city of Cali.
   He accused the Cali cartel of providing authorities with
information that led to the death of his close associate, Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha, in a shootout with police last month.
   Escobar wrote to El Tiempo publisher Hernando Santos Castillo
denying a report Monday in the Bogota newspaper that the Medellin
cartel was split. The article quoted security force officials as
saying Escobar's main allies were abandoning him as police and the
military closed in.
   ``My freedom is the best proof I have to show the country that
the people are not selling me out and that my friends are neither
abandoning nor betraying me,'' said the letter, also sent to other
news media.
   It bore Escobar's signature and what was apparently the imprint
of his index finger, intended to prove its authenticity.
   Authorities have failed to apprehend Escobar despite a
government offer of $500,000 for information leading to his capture
_ dead or alive.
   Escobar said the entire cartel was behind a peace offer made by
its leaders last week to the government of President Virgilio Barco.
   Military forces said meanwhile on Tuesday that they were taking
the necessary measures to protect President Bush from Escobar and
other traffickers when Bush attends an antidrug summit in the
coastal city of Cartagena on Feb. 15.
   U.S. authorities have reportedly said traffickers are preparing
an attempt on Bush's life during the five hours he is to spend in
Cartagena.
   The Barco administration has extradited 13 trafficking suspects
to the United States as part of an antidrug campaign that was
intensified last August.
   The drug lords responded with a terror campaign that killed 209
people, including bombing a Colombian airliner.
   The peace offer by the Medellin cartel last week, unlike
previous proposals, did not specifically demand an end to
extradition of suspects to the United States, the measure
traffickers fear most.
   It asked only for ``constitutional and legal guarantees'' in
exchange for the cartel's agreeing to abandon the cocaine trade,
lay down its arms and release its hostages.
   Since last week, the cartel has released five hostages,
including the son of Barco's closest aide, but still holds 16
people.
   El Tiempo reported Monday the peace offer was made by the
cartel's leaders, Escobar and Jorge Luis Ochoa, and that other
traffickers in the organization opposed any accommodation with the
government.
   Escobar's message Tuesday seemed to confirm the belief that
traffickers still demand an end to extradition. He underscored his
desire for a peace with the government that would stress Colombian
sovereignty.
   He also indicated no disagreement existed in the cartel over the
peace offer.
   ``If the Colombian government someday decides to fight for the
peace of our nation in a sovereign and courageous way, it will find
an interminable list of extradition candidates, drug traffickers,
hired assassins and paramilitary forces that want to join it in the
process,'' the letter read.
   The letter said Cali cartel member Jorge Valasquez gave police
information that led them to Rodriguez Gacha, who was considered
the most violent of the Medellin drug bosses.
   The government scored its most notable success in the antidrug
war on Dec. 15, when police killed Rodriguez Gacha in a gunbattle
in northern Colombia near Cartagena.
   ``There is a problem between us and the men of Cali,'' Escobar
confirmed in his letter.
   He said the Cali group sent him repeated offers to negotiate an
end to the cartel war, which has killed more than 200 people here
since January 1988, but he determined the proposals were
``disadvantageous.''
   Vice Adm. Gustavo Angel Mejia, in charge of security for the
antidrug summit, told a news conference Tuesday, ``We have been
assigned the responsibility of the presidential meeting in
Cartagena, and we are taking and will take the security measures
that are necessary.''
   Bush will meet Barco and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia
to discuss cooperation in the antinarcotics fight.
   The participation of Peru's president, Alan Garcia, remains in
doubt. Garcia said he would not attend unless U.S. invasion troops
left Panama.

   The Senate began consideration of a sweeping

   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called the
legislation essential to ``protect the health of Americans'' but
said he does not intend to ``force the pace'' of the legislation.
He said none of the bill's controversial provisions would be
considered before next week.
   In opening remarks, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., one of the bill's
floor managers, predicted some of the strongest provisons would be
fought by industry, especially automakers.
   ``We can appease the special interests ... or we can meet them
head on,'' he declared.
   The Senate bill calls for cutting acid-rain pollutants from
electric power plants in half, tightening auto emission controls
and requiring industries to install new technology to curb toxic
chemical releases. It's tougher than a clean-air bill before the
House and the proposal sent to Congress by President Bush last year.
   Senate leaders said there was bipartisan support for toughening
the 1970 Clean Air Act, but they acknowledged that regional
opposition to portions of the bill, especially the acid-rain
provisions, is likely to prompt heated debate in the coming weeks.
   Midwestern senators, whose state have many of the utility plants
that would have to install expensive pollution-control equipment,
argue the costs should be shared by other parts of the country.
Other senators and the White House strongly oppose such cost
sharing, arguing it amounts to a national electricity tax.
   Baucus in opening the floor debate noted that it has been 20
years since the first federal clean air law was enacted and 13
years since it was last amended. ``Our action we take ... will
affect public health well into the 21st Century,'' he said. He
noted at another point that 150 million Americans now live in areas
where the air at times does not meet federal health standards.
   But as the 101st Congress convened its second session Tuesday,
some senators grumbled about the sweeping provisions in the bill.
Mitchell agreed that many of the senators had not yet had an
opportunity to examine the 500-page bill, which cleared the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee in November and was not in
print until late December.
   Earlier, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said ``there's
division among Republicans, not based on partisanship so much as on
geography,'' to the legislation. ``The bill will take some time,''
he added.
   Earlier in the week, Bush raised objections to the Senate
legislation, which is more stringent than the House bill or the
administration's proposal. Bush maintained the Senate bill will
cost double the estimated $19 billion annual cost of the
administration proposal. Senate Democrats called the president's
estimates inflated.
   Both the Senate and House bills, as well as the Bush proposal,
call for a 10 million ton reduction in acid-rain pollutants,
require automakers to tighten tailpipe emission controls to meet
California standards nationwide and require industry to install the
best available technology to control toxic-air releases.

<HEAD>Soviets Reportedly Say They Would Not Stop German Unification</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-East Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German newspaper on Tuesday
quoted an adviser to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as
saying the Soviets would not stop German unification if the East
Germans want it.
   But Nikolai Portugalov, Gorbachev's adviser on German affairs,
was also quoted by the Hamburg-based Bild newspaper as cautioning
against forced acceleration of unification because it could
undermine Europe.
   Germany was divided into communist East and capitalist West
after Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime was defeated in World War II.
   Asked about his feelings on the Berlin Wall being opened and on
German unification, Portugalov was quoted as saying: ``It's
refreshing. It's in the atmosphere (in Berlin) and at the borders,
which have finally fallen.
   ``If the people of the German Democratic Republic want
reunification it will come. We will in no case be against this
decision and interfere. But a chaotic reunification serves no one.''
   Portugalov said he sees some danger of chaos resulting ``from
exalted emotions of certain circles in the Federal Republic (West
Germany), which are a mistake,'' Bild reported.
   ``We must be careful that the national order doesn't break down
(in East Germany).''
   The interview is to appear in Bild's Wednesday editions. It was
provided in advance to other news media.
   Portugalov reportedly said that reality and stability in Europe
cannot be fully ignored, and the process of unifying should only be
within the ``entire European concept.''
   ``Why should this process be artifically speeded up?
   ``Sometimes you (Germans) remind me of someone who has won a
lotto jackpot, and have nothing more in your heads than to rush to
Monte Carlo to gamble away your winnings,'' Bild quoted him as
saying.
   Asked what benefits he could see for the Soviets if the Germans
united economically, Portugalov was quoted as saying he saw it as a
positive move.
   ``If everything goes well it would help us enormously. It
concerns making our economy compatible to the market economy of the
West.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has rejected an Air
Force proposal to scrap 450 aging Minuteman missiles because it is
reluctant to reduce U.S. strategic forces in advance of
negotiations with the Soviet Union, according to a published report.
   The Pentagon declined comment Tuesday on the report appearing in
this week's edition of The Air Force Times, an independent
defense-oriented newspaper, that the missile retirement proposal
was ``turned off by the White House.''
   Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Oborn, a Pentagon spokesman, said: ``Mr.
Cheney offers advice to the president, and we don't talk about it.
Any advice that he has give will be evident when the budget is
released.''
   The single-warhead Minuteman 2 missiles, one of the oldest U.S.
strategic weapons systems, were deployed beginning in 1965 at three
bases spread across thousands of miles _ Ellsworth Air Force Base,
S.D.; Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo. and Malmstrom Air Force Base,
Mont.
   Retirement of the three missile wings was proposed to save about
$400 million a year in response to a White House directive for deep
cuts in the Air Force and other service budgets.
   The missiles are less accurate than others in the U.S. arsenal,
take 36 hours to switch targets and, according to published
reports, have shown signs of deterioration.

<HEAD>Report Says Minorities Under-Represented in British Military</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks and other ethnic minorities are
under-represented in the British military because they fear racial
discrimination, according to a government-commissioned report
released Tuesday.
   The researchers also said they encountered racially offensive
language from armed forces personnel at all levels during the
investigation.
   Management consultants Peat, Marwick McLintock, who conducted
the study for the Defense Ministry, said minorities comprised only
1.1 percent of the military, compared with about four percent of
the population.
   ``During interviews with all levels, views were expressed to us
and phrases used which would be considered racially offensive,''
the report said.
   ``We cannot be certain the use of racist language or
stereotyping betrays underlying racist attitudes,'' the report
added. ``We do believe, however, that such views have no place in
an organization committed to providing equal opportunities.''
   Armed Forces Minister Archie Hamilton said minority recruitment
will be stepped up following the report.
   In a written statement to Parliament, he said the results of the
report suggested many attitudes of young whites and blacks were
similar.
   ``However, they (blacks) are less likely to consider a career in
the Armed Forces for a number of reasons, including in many cases
they fear that they will encounter racial discrimination,''
Hamilton said.
   In a test case, a government-funded labor tribunal said Monday
it will hear allegations of racial discrimination against the
Defense Ministry by a black former member of the elite Grenadier
Guards.
   Winston Lindsay, 25, one of only two black guardsmen, went
absent without leave in October 1988 after allegedly being
ridiculed, bullied and assaulted by white guardsmen.
   He was later discharged from the army for failing to disclose a
previous assault conviction and turned down when he tried to
re-enlist.
   Most blacks in Britain are immigrants from former colonies in
Africa, Asia and the Caribbean and their descendants.
   London Metropolitan police have eliminated minimum height
restrictions in a bid to attract more minorities to the force.
   Assistant Commissioner Wyn Jones said Monday that the minimum
5-foot-8 for men and 5-foot-4 for women represented above-average
heights for people from the Bangladeshi, Chinese and Vietnamese
communities.
   London has 440 minority police officers, or 1.5 percent of the
force in a city where non-whites constitute 10 percent of the 6.7
million residents.
   About 60 percent of the city's 30,000-strong force lives outside
the city.
   The Metropolitan police will spend $2.4 million on an
advertising campaign to attract minority recruits.

<TEXT>
   The White House expressed confidence Tuesday
that President Bush can be adequately protected during a visit to
Colombia despite reports that drug lords may try to shoot down Air
Force One with a shoulder-fired missile.
   Bush, on a trip to Kansas City, Mo., merely smiled when
reporters asked him about the reported threat.
   ``The Secret Service says it can provide the president security
and the president intends to go'' to a drug summit in Cartagena,
Colombia, on Feb. 15, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said.
   Likewise, the Colombian ambassador to the United States, Victor
Mosquera Chaux, dismissed the report.
   ``I believe Colombian terrorists don't yet have missiles,'' he
said. ``I believe that it's a simple rumor. If they had them, they
would have used them already'' against government helicopters and
aircraft.
   Mosquera said his government is ``confident that we can and will
provide the necessary security required for this meeting.''
   CBS News reported Monday the Secret Service was checking the
reports that Colombian drug lords were smuggling SA-7
shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles into Colombia for an attempt
to shoot down Bush's plane.
   But Fitzwater said that his own inquiries on the matter had
drawn a blank and that the Secret Service apparently also is
unaware of such specific threats.
   ``Nobody here seems to have heard of missiles,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said the Secret Service ``has made several survey tours'' to
the summit site and is convinced it can protect the president.
   The report was the latest in a string of purported threats on
the president or members of his family by Colombian drug cartels.

<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel said
Tuesday he would invite Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
hold a summit meeting in Prague.
   Havel told Parliament he would propose his capital for the
U.S.-Soviet meeting during visits this year to Moscow and
Washington.
   He also proposed the word ``socialist'' be dropped from the
official name of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.
   Part of the session was taken up by legislators' demands for
withdrawal of Soviet soldiers stationed in Czechoslovakia since
1968, when a Warsaw Pact invasion ended the ``Prague Spring''
reforms.
   Legislator Michael Kocab said the agreement on ``temporary
deployment of Soviet troops on Czechoslovak territory ... is an
obvious violation of international law, especially the U.N. Charter
and the Warsaw Treaty. The agreement should be declared null and
void from the beginning.''
   A joint commission discussed the matter Jan. 10 in Prague and
indicated it would be settled next month.
   Since Czechoslovakia's whirlwind revolution, which took less
than a month and led to a non-Communist government in December,
officials have demanded the estimated 75,000 Soviet troops leave
leave by the end of 1990.
   Havel, a dissident playwright often jailed before the
revolution, told legislators Tuesday that he ``would like to
present to Mr. Gorbachev various important and mutually
interconnected proposals, including the offer to hold his future
meeting with Mr. Bush in Prague.''
   ``Naturally, I will present the same proposal shortly afterward
to Mr. Bush during the big state visit to the United States,''
Havel said in his first major speech to Parliament since it elected
him president Dec. 29.
   Dates of the visit to Moscow have not been announced, but
presidential spokesman Michael Zantovsky said it was scheduled for
``beginning of February.'' He did not say when Havel would visit
the United States.
   Bush and Gorbachev are tentatively scheduled to meet in June, in
the United States. It was not clear whether Havel was suggesting
that summit be moved to Prague.
   In Washington, Bush spokesman Roman Popadiuk said no official
word of the invitation had arrived and ``there are no plans for
anything beyond the June summit at this time.''
   There was no immediate reaction from Moscow.
   In suggesting the change in Czechoslovakia's official name,
Havel said: ``The word socialism lost meaning in our linguistic
context. The moral, political and economic crisis in our country is
linguistically inseparable from this word.''
   He said the national coat of arms that combined traditional and
Communist symbols was ``heraldic nonsense.'' Parliament has adopted
a new coat of arms that includes the historic Christian symbols of
the Czechs and Slovaks.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lebanese press went on strike Tuesday
to protest restrictions imposed a week ago by maverick Gen. Michel
Aoun on the media in the Christian enclave.
   The Press Association, which called the one-day strike, said
newspapers will not publish Wednesday to show solidarity with three
``sister publications that were forced shut by the de facto forces
in east Beirut.''
   The work stoppage did not cover the foreign press and broadcast
media.
   The association, an umbrella group for the publishers syndicate
and the reporters' syndicate, also called for a sit-in at its
headquarters in Moslem west Beirut's Raouche neighborhood Wednesday.
   Some Christian radio and television stations have maintained a
newscast strike since Aoun issued a directive last Tuesday banning
the media from referring to Elias Hrawi as president or Salim Hoss
as prime minister, a Sunni Moslem.
   Hrawi appointed Hoss and fired Aoun as prime minister and army
commander.
   Internationally recognized, Hrawi was elected Nov. 24 under an
Arab League-sponsored peace plan worked out by Lebanese legislators
in Saudi Arabia to end 14 years of civil strife that has killed
more than 150,000 people.
   An editor at the conservative Al-Anwar daily, the only paper
publishing in the Christian enclave, said no decision has been made
whether to abide by the strike.
   Al-Anwar has been publishing two editions since Friday _ one for
the Christian enclave that follows Aoun's censorship rules and the
other for the rest of the nation.
   Aoun has shut down Ad-Diyar and Al-Bayrak, the enclave's two
other functioning dailies, along with the Akhbar Al-Yom newsletter
for a week each for defying his censorship. Newspapers in west
Beirut that defied the measure were not allowed into the enclave.
   The nation's leading newspaper, An-Nahar, resumed publication
Monday after a six-day stoppage. The paper, which did not abide by
Aoun's restrictions, gave no reasons for reversing its decision.
   The paper was barred from the Christian sector by the army.
   The Christian radio stations _ Voice of Lebanon of the Phalange
party and Voice of Free Lebanon of the Lebanese Forces militia,
maintained a newscast strike for the eighth-day to protest Aoun's
measures.
   The Lebanese Broadcasting Corp., the Lebanese Forces' television
station, also has refrained from broadcasting news since Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators on Tuesday penalized a
fifth officer of the failed Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association and said they had again postponed a decision on whether
to act against Neil Bush, the president's son.
   Russell M. Murray, former executive vice president of the Denver
thrift, consented, without admitting guilt, to an order banning him
from working for a federally insured financial institution without
permission from regulators.
   The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision said it
expected within 10 days to announce a decision on Bush, who served
as a Silverado director from 1985 until August 1988 when his father
received the Republican presidential nomination.
   Last Thursday, the thrift office's Enforcement Review Committee
looked at new evidence on Bush's role in the thrift failure and had
said it would reconvene Tuesday.
   Over the past two weeks, the thrift office announced sanctions
against four other Silverado executives: the former chairman, chief
financial officer, chief operating officer and majority stockholder.
   Regulators have blamed Silverado's failure, expected to cost
taxpayers up to $1 billion, on management's decision to invest
heavily in ailing Colorado commercial real estate. They've also
cited an unusually large number of problem transactions between
Silverado officials and the thrift's borrowers.
   Bush, a partner in an oil exploration firm, had business deals
with two of Silverado's major borrowers, developers Bill L. Walters
and Ken Good. He has denied wrongdoing and said he is cooperating
fully with regulators.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has decided to endorse a
proposal that would elevate the Environmental Protection Agency to
Cabinet status and give it greater clout within the government,
administration and congressional sources said Tuesday.
   The president was expected to meet Wednesday with key sponsors
of legislation that would create a Department of the Environment
and afterward announce his support for the move, the sources said.
   Earlier this week, administration officials confirmed that key
presidential advisers in recent months have expressed support for
elevating the EPA, a regulatory agency created in 1970, to a higher
status, but that the president had not made a final decision.
   Bush during his first year in office had not looked favorably at
expanding the Cabinet, maintaining that such a move would interfere
with efficient management of the government. The EPA would become
the 15th Cabinet agency.
   But as the environment has become an increasingly high-profile
issue, there has been growing momentum in Congress to put the EPA
on par with other agencies of the government. Supporters argued
that in an era in which environmental issues are often global, the
United States is one of only a few industrial nations that does not
have an environmental advocate on the ministerial, or Cabinet,
level.
   Bipartisan bills were introduced in the House and Senate on
Tuesday calling for the creation of a Department of the Environment
and elevating the EPA administrator to a Cabinet secretary.
   The bills also call for creation of a presidential commission
that would examine the effectiveness of current environmental laws
and recommend ways to streamline the government's effeciveness in
implementing environmental regulations.
   Administration sources said that while Bush continues to have
concerns about some aspects of the bills, he plans to express his
support for adding the EPA to the Cabinet.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio and a co-sponsor of the Senate
legislation, said the Senate Government Operations Committee, which
he chairs, will give the measure an early hearing.
   Glenn said he expected the bill to have widespread support.
   In the House, similar legislation was introduced with two dozen
co-sponsors.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of the House Governor
Operations Committee, said he hoped the bill could be approved
before the Earth Day celebrations in late April.

<TEXT>
   Alcohol consumption is at its lowest level in
two decades, but it still is more widely used than any other drug
or cigarettes, a government report said Tuesday.
   The report said a steady decline in alcohol consumption since
1981 may be the result of increased public awareness about the
risks of alcohol use, as well as the aging of the population.
Consumption is lower among people over 60.
   Another reason, the report suggested, is increasing concern
about health and fitness, which also has contributed to the
decrease in smoking, said the report by the Department of Health
and Human Services.
   The 400-page document, the Seventh Special Report to the U.S.
Congress on Alcohol and Health, compiles the latest scientific
advances in understanding the health consequences of alcohol abuse.
The report is issued every three years.
   The report calculates that per capita consumption was 2.54
gallons of pure alcohol in 1987, the lowest level since 1970. The
formula used for the calculation takes into account the relative
differences in alcohol content of beer, wine and spirits.
   Consumption of spirits dropped to its lowest level since 1958,
estimated at 0.83 gallons of pure alcohol per capita in 1987, the
report said. Beer and wine consumption remained about the same in
1987 as in the previous year.
   The report also cites a U.S. household survey of people over age
12 in 1988 by the National Institute on Drug Abuse showing that
73.4 percent reported drinking alcohol in the past year, while 36.2
percent reported smoking cigarettes.
   The report also found:
   _About 10.5 million U.S. adults show signs of alcoholism and 7.2
million suffer from alcohol abuse although they do now show signs
of dependence.
   _High school seniors showed a decline in alcohol use during the
1980s, but in 1988, one study showed, 92 percent had tried alcohol,
nearly two-thirds were current drinkers and more than a third were
occasional heavy drinkers.
   _Nearly half of all motor vehicle accidents are alcohol-related.
   _About 25 percent of hospital patients have alcohol-related
problems.
   _The cost of alcohol abuse and dependence is estimated at $136.3
billion.
   The report can be obtained from the National Clearinghouse for
Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, Md. 20852.
It will be available in about six weeks, the department said.

   Former Mayor John V. Lindsay, who has had a
recent history of heart problems, collapsed Tuesday afternoon in an
office building and was admitted to New York Hospital, police said.
   The Emergency Medical Service, which sent an ambulance to the
scene, described Lindsay as conscious but feeling dizzy and weak
when he was picked up on the second floor of the midtown hospital,
police said.
   Lindsay, 68, was brought to the hospital's emergency room, where
shortly before 4 p.m. he was being evaluated, undergoing tests and
``doing well,'' said New York Hospital spokeswoman Kathy Robinson.
   Lindsay was admitted for observation in stable condition, she
said.
   Mayor David Dinkins' office announced that Dinkins went to the
hospital after hearing of Lindsay's illness.
   In January 1988, Lindsay underwent a 4{-hour operation to repair
a leaky heart valve at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Last
March, he was hospitalized again and underwent tests in the
coronary intensive care unit of New York Hospital.
   Lindsay was a three-term congressman when he was elected mayor
in 1965 as a Republican. He was re-elected as an independent,
switched to the Democratic Party and made a bid for the
presidential nomination before leaving City Hall in 1973.
   He since has practiced law in Manhattan with the firm of Webster
and Sheffield.

<HEAD>Tass Says Moslem Central Asian Convicted of Spying for Afghan
Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Moslem from Soviet Central Asia has been
sentenced to eight years in prison on charges of spying for Afghan
rebels, the Tass news agency reported Tuesday.
   Tass said Abdulkhamid Davlatov tried to set up an underground
group of Soviet Moslems in the southern republic of Tadzhikistan
``to struggle for the overthrow of the existing system.''
   Davlatov admitted his guilt, Tass said. He was charged with high
treason, anti-Soviet activity and illegally crossing the border.
Some previous high treason convictions have been punished with
death.
   The report came at a time when predominantly Moslem Azerbaijanis
have torn down large sections of the border with Iran, entered open
battles with their mainly Christian Armenian neighbors and begun
calling for secession.
   The unrest, which has evoked approving reaction in
fundamentalist Iran, has raised the prospect long predicted by
Western scholars of an Islamic awakening among the Soviet Union's
tens of millions of Moslems.
   Davlatov, 34, crossed the border into Afghanistan in mid-1988
and was sent by Afghan rebels he tied up with to an intelligence
center in Pakistan, Tass said. Recruited by a spy chief Tass
identified as ``a certain Bashir,'' he agreed to return to the
Soviet Union and foment subversion.
   But, Tadzhikistan's KGB chief Vladimir Petkel told Tass,
Davlatov was under surveillance as soon as he crossed back into the
Soviet Union, and his network of contacts has been uncovered.
   Petkel said the KGB had foiled several attempts by Pakistani
intelligence and Afghan rebels ``to involve Soviet citizens in
hostile actions on Soviet territory.'' He gave no details.
   Tass said Bashir had been active in trying to foster subversion
in Central Asia. There have been few previous reports of Afghan
rebels actively trying to recruit their fellow Moslems across the
border.
   The rebels fought Soviet troops during their nine-year
involvement in Afghanistan, which ended last February, and are
continuing to oppose the country's Soviet-backed government.

   A former police officer who burglarized
computer stores while in uniform, then investigated his own
break-ins was sentenced to three years and eight months in state
prison Tuesday.
   Newman Ng ``took advantage of his position of public trust,''
said Alameda County Superior Court Judge Henry Ramsey Jr., who
denied a defense request for probation.
   However, Ramsey set bail of $250,000 pending appeal for Ng, who
has been in custody since his conviction in November.
   A co-defendant, another officer already serving a jail term,
faces additional charges for burglaries allegedly committed while
free on bond awaiting trial.
   Ng, 33, who was with the Oakland Police Department for 7{ years,
was found guilty of four counts of burglary and two counts of
receiving stolen property in connection with three separate
break-ins of computer stores in March 1987.
   The break-ins occurred while Ng was in uniform at the end of his
shift, said Deputy District Attorney Matthew Golde.
   Ng, an evidence specialist, investigated his own crimes and
never found any substantial evidence, Golde said. Investigators,
however, found a computer in his police locker and computer
equipment in his Castro Valley home.
   Ng's co-defendant, former Oakland police officer Kailey Wong,
pleaded guilty last year to two counts of burglary and was
sentenced to one year in the county jail and five years of
probation.
   Golde said Wong faces three additional burglary charges stemming
from computer store burglaries that occurred while Wong was out on
bail awaiting trial on the original charges.

   The Interior Department is preparing to
announce a new computer system aimed at blocking violators of the
nation's strip mining laws from receiving new coal mining permits,
sources said Tuesday.
   The agreement, said to have been approved by Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan, is aimed at settling the latest skirmish in a 10-year
legal battle to compel the department to rigidly enforce
strip-mining laws.
   Sources close to the negotiations, who spoke on condition that
they not be identified, said Lujan was ready to announce the terms
of the agreement at a news conference on Wednesday.
   Filed in 1980 by an environmental group named Save Our
Cumberland Mountains, the suit arose out of the conviction of many
residents of the coal mining regions of Appalachia that strip
mining laws were going unenforced under Interior Secretary James
Watt.
   An initial settlement was reached in 1981 with the filing of a
court order directing the department to install a computer system
to match up past violators of the law with new applicants for coal
mining permits.
   Critics of the previous enforcement system complained that in
many cases stip mine operators found to have violated the law
simply changed the name of their companies and applied for a new
permit at another location.
   Many such operators were failing to comply with the provisions
of the law that the land be restored after the mining was completed.
   But the computer did not end complaints and environmentalists
contended it had been wholly ineffective.
   Early last year, the Save Our Cumberland Mountains organization
sought a court order to hold the Interior Department in contempt of
court for alleged non-compliance with the earlier court order that
it strictly enforce the strip-mining law.
   The group's action resulted in intense negotiations with the
department and leading to the reported agreement.
   Details of how the new system would improve on the old system
were not immediately available.

   Congressional budget experts believe it will
take $74 billion in spending cuts or revenue increases to meet next
year's federal deficit target, about twice as much as the Bush
administration believes, a congressional source said Tuesday.
   The Congressional Budget Office is projecting that the budget
deficit for the 1991 fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, short of any
action by lawmakers, would be $138 billion, the official said. That
would mean that $74 billion in higher revenues or spending cuts
would be needed to meet the $64 billion target set for next year by
the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
   The budget office is scheduled to release its official
projection of the 1991 budget shortfall on Wednesday to the Senate
Budget Committee.
   When President Bush unveils his proposed 1991 budget on Monday,
he is expected to say that $30 billion to $35 billion in budget
savings are needed to meet Gramm-Rudman's $64 billion deficit
target. Bush is expected to propose spending $1.23 trillion next
year.
   The estimates are different because the administration is using
more optimistic forecasts for economic growth than the budget
office is using.
   By law, the administration's shortfall forecast is binding,
leaving the budget office figures little more than advisory. But
the projections by the non-partisan office are considered by many
lawmakers and budget observers to be more reliable than those from
the White House.
   Under Gramm-Rudman, automatic spending cuts are triggered in
most federal programs should Congress and the president fail to
agree to savings that meet the deficit target. That happened last
fall, but a compromise between President Bush and Congress was
enacted that will lift the cuts early next month.
   The deficit targets set by Gramm-Rudman, however, apply only to
the coming fiscal year. The law sets no penalties if the actual
deficit ends up exceeding the legal target, which has happened
every year since Gramm-Rudman was enacted in 1985.
   The White House's Office of Management and Budget is expected to
forecast that the economy will expand this year by about 2.6
percent, measured from the fourth quarter of last year through the
third quarter of 1990. CBO's projection will be 1.8 percent, the
source said.
   As a rule of thumb, every 1 percentage point in economic growth
adds $25 billion to federal revenue collections, since a healthier
economy means more robust tax collections.
   Fifty-one private economists surveyed by Blue Chip Economic
Indicators, a private publication, have projected that the economy
will expand by an average of 1.7 percent this year. That would be
the slowest U.S. economic growth since 1982.

   Flor Morales ``Ramito'' Ramos, one
of Puerto Rico's most famous folkloric singers, fatally shot
himself in the head early Tuesday, police said. He was 74.
   ``He committed suicide with a shot in the right ear at 12:50
a.m. while in the home of his in-laws'' in this southern coastal
town, said police Lt. Saulo Flores. Officials did not immediately
report a motive.
   During his 40-year career Ramos, who had 18 children from six
successive marriages, performed in dozens of countries and recorded
more than 50 records.
   Among songs that made him famous with the islanders and Puerto
Ricans in New York, where he performed frequently, was ``El Apagon
de Nueva York'' (New York Blackout).
   Other popular songs included ``Estrella de Oriente'' (East Star)
and ``No Cambio A Puerto Rico'' (I Won't Change Puerto Rico).
   Nestor Figueroa Lugo, an expert in Puerto Rican folkloric music,
said Ramos was ``the best singer of back-country music, of music
from the countryside.''
   Born Sept. 5, 1915, in the central town of Caguas, Ramos
performed for Puerto Rican soldiers serving in the U.S. Army during
World War II in the Pacific and during the Korean and Vietnam wars.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<HEAD>Judge Orders New Trial in Newspaper Reporter Bombing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former plumber convicted, then cleared, in the
murder of a newspaper reporter was ordered Tuesday to stand trial
again, more than 13 years after the fatal car bombing.
   Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Thomas O'Toole's order came
during a preliminary hearing for James Robison, who was convicted
with two other men in the slaying of investigative reporter Don
Bolles of The Arizona Republic.
   Robison's 1977 conviction and that of Max Dunlap were overturned
in 1980 by the Arizona Supreme Court, but state Attorney General
Bob Corbin reopened the case several months ago and filed a new
murder charge against Robison last November.
   Dunlap and the third man, who remains in prison pending appeal,
were not charged again.
   Bolles, 47, died 11 days after a remote-controlled bomb attached
to his car exploded June 2, 1976, at a Phoenix hotel. The motive
has remained murky, with a tangle of theories about who ordered the
death.
   No mastermind has ever been charged.
   Robison's chief attorney, Tom Henze, did not immediately return
a reporter's telephone call after the preliminary hearing, but
contends that Corbin lacked authority to file the new charge.
   Henze said state prosecutors lacked jurisdiction because only
county attorneys and county grand juries can initiate murder cases.
   O'Toole ruled state prosecutors filed the charge against Robison
pursuant to a grant of authority by Maricopa County Attorney
Richard Romley.
   Henze challenged that ruling and went to the state Court of
Appeals, which scheduled arguments for Feb. 14 but refused to delay
Robison's preliminary hearing.
   O'Toole heard four days of testimony at the preliminary hearing
before ruling in a three-paragraph decision there was probable
cause to hold a new trial for Robison based on the evidence that
had been presented.
   Prosecutors presented little new evidence during the preliminary
hearing, though they have hinted they are holding back until the
new trial.
   Robison did not testify at the hearing, but prosecutors
introduced a transcript of an unpublished interview he gave
magazine writers in 1979 in which he denied killing Bolles but
acknowledged having seen the bomb's remote control and withholding
evidence from police.
   The judge scheduled Robison's arraignment for Feb. 4. Any trial
date would be scheduled at that time.
   Bolles left notes saying he had gone to the Clarendon Hotel to
meet John Harvey Adamson, a racing-dog breeder who remains in
prison for the killing pending appeal.
   A state grand jury in October began investigating conspiracy and
obstruction of justice allegations in the Bolles' case.

   Europeans and even poor countries have
sent aid since Romania's revolution, but not the United States, the
government said Tuesday. The U.S. Embassy said American help had
arrived, but quietly.
   ``The Americans said they would give us some help, but nothing
has come; we are still waiting,'' said Ion Radulescu, who organizes
distribution of foreign aid for the interim National Salvation
Front government.
   Embassy spokeswoman Agota Kuperman said in response: ``The
problem is that we didn't put red, white and blue flags on it. We
didn't come in with a fanfare. We did it very quietly and that
might have been a mistake.
   ``We gave $500,000 worth of aid to the International Committee
of the Red Cross, $250,000 in medicine and $25,000 from the
ambassador's discretionary fund.''
   A tour of Bucharest's main exhibition center, which has become a
depot for supplies donated from abroad, revealed little from the
United States.
   Daniela Calota, who works for the government pharmaceutical
office and was helping sort medical aid, said only three large
trucks of U.S. supplies had arrived in the month since dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu was overthrown.
   The only U.S. goods in the hall set aside for medicine were
cartons of saline solution from the Feed The Children charity based
in Oklahoma and some U.S.-made disposable syringes from an unknown
donor.
   Cartons of drugs and medical supplies from China, Thailand,
Mongolia, Zimbabwe, Egypt, the U.N. Children's Fund and virtually
all East and West European countries were in separate piles on the
floor of the cavernous, freezing building.
   Mrs. Calota picked up two packs of German bandages in old brown
wrappers with the expiration dates June 29, 1938, and Nov. 25,
1942, which had arrived in one shipment. ``Bandages from the Third
Reich,'' she said. ``It's amazing.''
   She displayed boxes of antibiotics from Iran dated 1970 to 1973
and picked up one of a dozen canvas stretchers. ``This kind of
stretcher is from the Second World War,'' she said.
   An X-ray machine from the Hospital Broussais in Paris stood in
the hall. ``It's very old and it's a problem,'' she said.
   Asked what the government would do with the old drugs and
bandages, she said: ``We'll put it on the fire. It's dangerous. We
made a revolution ... and we are poor, but don't give us what you
are throwing away.
   ``With the exception of the shipment from Iran, all the medicine
is very good, and we need it because we have problems to eliminate
from 10 to 15 years ago, not just from now,'' she said.
   Radulescu said ``we don't want to make a fuss'' about the
out-of-date material. ``There have been some problems,'' he said,
``but in general the medicine we received is good, new, and it's
helping a lot.''
   France was the first and largest donor, he said, followed by
Belgium; the Netherlands; West Germany; Italy; the Moldavian region
of the Soviet Union, which has a large Romanian population;
Hungary; Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.
   West Germany is providing 350 megawatts of electricity daily for
two months without charge and the 12-nation European Economic
Community is giving 250,000 tons of animal fodder, 10,000 tons of
butter, 20,000 tons of beef and 5,000 tons of cooking oil, he said.
   Romania still urgently needs food and fodder, along with
medicine and medical equipment ``to maintain minimum standards of
the hospitals and clinics.'' Radulescu said.
   Mrs. Calota said the greatest need in medical supplies was for
disinfectant, surgical instruments and drugs for heart and liver
ailments.
   Nicolae Constantinescu of the Ministry of Commerce was
overseeing soldiers and workers who separated news shipments in the
main exhibition hall.
   He said part was going to poor people, part to those who
suffered from the revolution and part to families with more than
five children. New clothing was being given to stores for public
sale, he said.
   ``Maybe you can help us with soap, toothpaste, razor blades and
all cosmetics for men and women, because we have none,''
Constantinescu said. ``We need cooking oil and flour. All people
want to make bread in the houses, but we haven't flour.''
   Basketball is the third most popular sport in Romania, ``but we
have no shoes,'' he said. ``The balls we imported from China, but
now we have no money.''
   A truck drove in to pick up salami casings from Czechoslovakia.
   ``The Romanians love salami and we don't make these,'' said
Adrian Sucigan, an economist at the Popesti Leordeni sausage
factory. ``We can use as much as we can get.''

<HEAD>Peres Says Agreement Near on Holding Peace Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shimon Peres, Israel's finance minister and
deputy prime minister, said Tuesday that agreement toward holding
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks is near, but he still ruled out a
role for the PLO.
   Speaking to reporters at Cairo International Airport upon
arrival for talks with Egyptian officials, Peres said a few
problems remained in plans for a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue to be
held in this capital.
   ``Today, we are so near to start meaningful negotations with
Palestinians. It would be a fatal mistake to give it up,'' said
Peres, who is scheduled to meet Wednesday with President Hosni
Mubarak and Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
   Earlier Tuesday, Abdel-Meguid expressed ``cautious optimism ''
about the peace efforts, while admitting there were still some
points of difference.
   Peres, referring to recent Washington talks that involved
officials from Egypt, Israel and the United States, said he
believes the parties ``have agreed on practically most of the
issues.''
   He defined one of the remaining problems as being the inclusion
of Palestinians deported from Israeli-occupied territories in the
the delegation that would meet with Israelis in Cairo.
   ``I for one, say yes. ... I know there is very strong support
(in Israel) for the view that I have just expressed,'' he said.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has rejected that
possibility on the grounds deported Palestinians are active PLO
members.
   When asked about participation by the Palestine Liberation
Organization, Peres said: ``I don't think there is a need.''
   Israel's refusal to deal with the PLO, which it describes as a
terrorist organization bent on destroying Israel, is one of the
sticking points in discussions to arrange for a dialogue in Cairo.
Egypt and the Palestinians insist on a role for the PLO.
   Another problem in the proposed Cairo dialogue is the Arab
demand for an open agenda, while Israel wants to focus only on its
proposal for elections in the West Bank and Gaza to choose
Palestinian representatives for negotiations on limited interim
autonomy.
   Washington has backed Egyptian and Palestinian demands that
issues other than the elections can be raised.

   The Soviet Union and Israel signed a trade
agreement Tuesday to end a 23-year break in economic relations, the
Tass news agency reported.
   The agreement creates a legal basis for business contacts
between the two countries. A Soviet chamber of commerce will open
in Tel Aviv and its Israeli counterpart in Moscow this year.
   Projects are under way to use the Israeli method of drip
irrigation in the Soviet Union and Israel is also expected to
supply agricultural produce, Tass said. Joint ventures include a
medical equipment company in the Ukraine.
   Moscow broke off diplomatic ties after the 1967 Middle East War,
saying it was protesting Israeli aggression, but relations have
warmed steadily in recent years and the two countries have
exchanged consular delegations.

   A junk dealer offered prayers and
cooperation as FBI agents searched his warehouse Tuesday looking
for an old typewriter that could help solve the mail bomb killings
of a judge and a civil rights lawyer.
   Wayne O'Ferrell ate lunch with FBI agents and accompanied them
to his warehouse Tuesday afternoon, one day after about 100 agents
scoured O'Ferrell's home, warehouse and abandoned store, about 75
miles from Montgomery in southeastern Alabama.
   O'Ferrell, 46, a one-time rural preacher, said he asked several
members of his church ``to pray for my family that we can get
through this thing and I've asked them to pray for the FBI to find
whatever they are looking for.''
   FBI agent Chuck Archer said there have been no arrests and that
three search warrants have been approved for property other than
O'Ferrell's. He did not identify the property.
   Agents unearthed the top of O'Ferrell's home septic tank Tuesday
afternoon and began pumping out its contents. Authorities also plan
to dig up a septic tank at the warehouse. Archer refused to say
what investigators were looking for in the septic tanks.
   Archer declined to describe O'Ferrell as a suspect. ``He is one
of many people we have interviewed,'' said the FBI agent.
   Court records show O'Ferrell lost a lawsuit heard on appeal by
U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Vance. The judge was killed Dec. 16 when
a package bomb sent through the mail exploded at his home in
suburban Birmingham.
   Robert Robinson, a black civil rights lawyer in Savannah, Ga.,
was killed two days later by another exploding package, and similar
mail bombs were defused at the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta, where Vance served, and at National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People headquarters in Jacksonville, Fla.
   FBI sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed
published reports that typewritten correspondence in O'Ferrell's
court case appears to match typewritten correspondence allegedly
sent by the mail bomber.
   Archer, asked about the typewriter, said only that a news report
this month mentioned that agents are looking for a typewriter used
by the mail bomber.
   ``They were looking for a typewriter that we may have sold,''
O'Ferrell said Tuesday as FBI agents weighed the results of their
search of the junk dealer's warehouse and other family property.
   ``It's possible we could have had the typewriter in the last two
years,'' he told radio station WKMX in Enterprise. ``But we don't
know what typewriter they're talking about. You don't keep a record
of everything you sell.''
   ``I don't know anything about any of it,'' he said. ``I don't
have anything to hide. When it's all over with, I'll be glad to get
with the media and go into details.''
   He said the FBI asked him not to talk to the media ``until they
get what they want done.''
   O'Ferrell had sued Gulf Life Insurance Co. of Jacksonville, for
firing him, challenging the company's claim that he held licenses
with other insurance companies. O'Ferrell also claimed Gulf Life
owed him commissions.
   The lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge in Montgomery in
June 1988. Last April, Vance and two other judges on the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court ruling in a
one-page unsigned decision.
   O'Ferrell, described by a neighbor as a former Baptist preacher
who took up the junk business about three years ago, was questioned
by investigators Monday, and joined them in a brief trip to the
warehouse Tuesday. The mail bomb investigation team has been
interviewing people and searching various locales in the Enterprise
vicinity since Saturday.
   U.S. Magistrate John Carroll of Montgomery has not released
affidavits filed by fedeal investigators to get search warrants for
O'Ferrell's property. The case file of O'Ferrell's lawsuit against
Gulf Life also has been sealed by court order and apparently has
been taken by the FBI as potential evidence in the mail bomb case.
   Morris Dees, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said
Tuesday that O'Ferrell's name is not in the files of white hate
groups that the center's Klanwatch project maintains. The FBI has
said it does not appear from a possible profile that the mail
bomber would belong to any white supremacist organization.
   A letter claiming responsibility for the mail bombs was received
by WAGA-TV in Atlanta from an indvidual or group calling itself
Americans for a Competent Federal Judicial System and expressing
anger over racial desegregation cases and a homicide in which
blacks are accused of raping and murdering a white woman.

<HEAD>Brazil's Striking Oil Workers End 8-Day Walkout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of oil workers voted
Tuesday night to accept a court-proposed raise of 31 percent and
end their eight-day nationwide walkout, labor officials said.
   Luis Fernando Maia of the National Strike Command said workers
at 10 refineries of the state oil monopoly Petrobras accepted the
pay hike and would return to work immediately.
   ``The crisis is over, all refineries have suspended the
strike,'' Maia said in a telephone interview. ``Workers nationwide
are heading back to their shifts.''
   Maia said oil production in the northeastern states of Alagoas,
Sergipe, and offshore platforms in Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro and
Sao Paulo would resume operations Wednesday morning.
   ``Production and refining operations should be normalized within
two days,'' said Maia. He said Brazil's supply of gasoline would
return to normal within a week.
   Maia said the strikers from 19 unions accepted a Monday ruling
by the Superior Labor Court that oil workers were entitled to a
raise of 31.2 percent to compensate for losses due to inflation.
   The increase was less than half what strikers were demanding but
more than Petrobras' offer.
   ``It was a Solomonic decision. It should satisfy everyone and
put an end to a strike that has anguished the nation,'' Labor Court
Judge Marco Aurelio Prates de Macedo said after the eight-hour
session.
   Still, Maia warned of possible problems with the agreement down
the road.
   ``The agreement says nothing about retroactivity to the date of
our salary readjustment, which is Sept. 1,'' said Maia. ``This
could be a future problem.''
   The strike began Jan. 16, when most of Petrobras' 60,151
employees walked off their jobs.
   The strikers demanded a raise of 65 percent, retroactive to
Sept. 1. Union leaders said the increase was to offset losses from
two government anti-inflation plans in 1987 and 1989, when wages
and prices were frozen in an unsuccessful attempt to control
inflation.
   Inflation was a record 1,765 percent last year and has averaged
about 50 percent a month since fall.
   Petrobras offered 21.5 percent. The company claimed it had a
deficit of more than $1 billion in 1989 and didn't have the money
to pay more.
   Salaries for Petrobras workers range from 3,000 new cruzados a
month, or $220, to about 50,000 cruzados, or $3,700, for top
executives.
   The strike shut down eight of Brazil's 11 refineries and reduced
output at two others, according to strike leaders. However,
so-called ``essential areas'' such as production of cooking gas
were kept operating were skeleton crews.
   Crude oil production of about 650,000 barrels of oil a day was
unaffected. Exports of petroleum products were maintained,
including shipments of about 80,000 barrels of gasoline a day to
the United States, Petrobras said.

   President Bush on Tuesday said a
Democratic anti-crime bill is ``a sheep in wolf's clothing'' and
promised he will recommend record spending on drug education and
treatment.
   After a tour of a once drug infested street, Bush said that an
anti-crime bill pending in the Senate under the sponsorship of Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Del., is merely a ``Trojan Horse.''
   ``It looks like a real crime bill. Sounds like a real crime
bill. But in actuality it will be tougher on law enforcement than
on criminals,'' he told a gathering of Kansas City law enforecment
officials. ``America needs a crime bill with teeth, but this is a
sheep in wolf's clothing.''
   Biden said in Washington that the primary difference between the
versions of the bill is over how much resources should be committed.
   ``The president called my proposal `a Trojan horse standing at
the gates of Congress,''' Biden said in a release. ``Well, the
Trojan horse was filled with soldiers who won their war, and my
crime bill is loaded with money for more police and drug agents _
soldiers we need to fight the war on crime today.''
   The White House contends Biden's bill falls short as it pertains
to exclusionary rules of evidence, habeas corpus and the death
penalty.
   Biden's provisions in those areas, Bush said, ``will only
entrench and extend the legal loopholes and red tape that disrupt
law enforcement and have angered the American people for far too
long.''
   Bush toured a street where three so-called crack houses were
boarded up, and visited with residents who had helpled organize the
neighborhood against crime.
   Several members from a committee called Black Men Together
demonstrated for the president how they discourage drug users by
chanting: ``Hey Pusher, hey you. Black men out here are watching
you,'' and ``You better run dope pusher, better run.''
   Bush will announce the second phase of his national anti-drug
strategy Thursday in a speech to newspaper publishers, said White
House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``Our national drug strategy calls for record levels of new
funding for both education and treatment,'' Bush said, referring to
the plan his drug policy coordinator William Bennett put forward
Sept. 5.
   The administration has not given any specific figures for the
second phase.
   Fitzwater also said Bush still intends to go to the Feb. 15 drug
summit in Cartagena, Colombia, despite a news report tht druglords
are procuring anti-aircraft missiles in a plan to shoot down Air
Force One.
   ``The Secret Service assures us they can provide security,''
Fitzwater told reporters flying with the president Tuesday.
   Bush professed as he flew to Kanas City to be holding out a hand
of cooperation to Congress on its return Tuesday from a two-month
recess.
   ``We're renewing the spirit of cooperation,'' he said.
   But he later noted one of points festering between the White
House and Capitol Hill.
   He said Congress ``deserves our thanks for providing the new
federal troops we asked for _ new agents, new prosecutors, and new
prisons to catch, convict and contain those who prey on our
cities.''
   ``But it's time for Congress to finish the job. Because it does
no good to send the troops into battle wearing handcuffs,'' he told
the law enforcement audience.
   Bennett is developing the second stage of an anti-drug plan,
which features money for eradication and interdiction in the South
American drug production countries, as well as more money for
prisons, education and treatment programs and federal assistance
for state and community crime-fighting efforts.
   Bush has repeatedly criticized Congress for enacting only part
of his anti-crime plan. In November, lawmakers voted $4.2 billion
to expand federal prison capacity, hire more prosecutors and
federal agents and take other measures in the war on crime.
   That was $500 million more than Bush had asked for, according to
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   But Bush also is urging passage of tougher sentencing for
hardened criminals, restrictions on plea bargaining and the death
penalty for drug dealers who kill police.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said the administration
considers Biden's bill too weak because it:
   _Contains ``too many exceptions'' on the death penalty.
   _Does not incorporate Bush's request for exclusionary laws to
permit officers a ``good faith'' exception in evidence gathering if
it is later found the search violated constitutional protections.
   _Does not follow Bush's proposal for ``habeas corpus reforms to
stop the frivolous appeals that are choking the courts.''
   _Lacks the elements for coordination and cooperation between law
enforcement agencies that Bush is pushing.
   A Judiciary Committee aide, who asked not to be identified, said
Biden's legislation is similar to Bush's but bans ``racially
discriminatory executions'' and allows good-faith exceptions to the
exclusionary rule only if the illegal search was conducted with a
warrant.
   Biden's bill would also ban the assembly, sale or transfer of
assault weapons. Bush has banned import of semiautomatic assault
weapons.
   Biden's bill would nearly double the amount of federal aid for
local law enforcement recommended by Bush, from $350 million to
$600 million, and add 1,000 FBI agents, 350 drug enforcement agents
and 300 prosecutors.

   The state Board of Education approved rules
Tuesday that will do away with undergraduate education majors and
instead require prospective teachers to focus on subjects such as
history, English and chemistry.
   The action, which also will require a master's degree for
teacher certification, reflects a national trend in which school
systems are looking for instructors who know more about the subject
they are teaching.
   ``I think it will enhance the teachers enormously,'' said Susan
Tave Zelman, state assistant commissioner for education personnel.
``It will better prepare them for their subject and give them
better depth and breadth.''
   Currently in Massachusetts, teachers can receive a permanent
certificate by completing undergraduate studies in education.
   But starting next fall, students in both public and private
colleges who plan to pursue a teaching career will be required to
choose a major from the liberal arts and sciences.
   ``You have to major in subjects like history, chemistry or
physics _ these sort of real subjects rather than education,'' said
Terry Zoulas, spokesman for the state Board of Regents of Higher
Education.
   ``I think there's a consensus that the first prerequisite is to
know your subject matter,'' he said. ``There's something to be said
about knowing how to teach, but it shouldn't be the only thing.''
   While students are majoring in these other subjects, they also
will take education courses to learn skills such as evaluating and
communicating with students.
   When they graduate, they will receive a provisional teaching
certificate that will be valid for five years. During that time,
the prospective teachers will work toward a master's degree that
also will combine education courses with their chosen field of
expertise.
   In addition, they will get classroom experience under the
guidance of ``mentor'' teachers.
   Education officials describe this element as the clinical
component of the plan, similar to medical students who work in
hospitals, receiving advice from practicing doctors. If the
candidates successfully complete their graduate work and
provisional teaching experience, they receive full certificates.
   ``To make teaching a major profession is the goal of this,''
Zoulas said.
   Ernest Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching, called the plan ``a really creative and
responsible move.''
   ``I have never felt it was adequate for education to be the
major field for teachers,'' he said. ``The first test of a teacher
is what they teach.''
   Teachers groups around the country have stressed a need to
elevate the image of their profession, which they say faces a
shortage of quality instructors.
   Jamie Horwitz, spokesman for the American Federation of Teachers
in Washington, D.C., said his group supports looking for new
certification methods to draw more people into teaching.
   This not only means drawing teachers from a pool of liberal arts
and science majors, but also includes offering the option of
teaching to other professionals, such as engineers, who might want
to leave their jobs.
   ``We can get good people in the classroom,'' he said. ``We can
upgrade the quality of professionals in the profession.''
   Six other states _ Connecticut, Illinois, Nevada, North
Carolina, Texas and Virginia _ have eliminated the undergraduate
education major as a requirement for prospective teachers.
   But Steve Wollmer, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Teachers
Association, said while his group supports the new program in
general, ``we are not convinced that it will work.''
   For example, he said, special education instructors who teach
children with learning disabilities require very specific training.
   ``It's hard to expect someone who majors in liberal arts to walk
into a special needs class and do a good job,'' he said.
   Also, a key element of the program is using mentor teachers, but
Wollmer said with Massachusetts already under budget strains, the
state might find it difficult to provide the teachers to serve in
this program.
   Zelman said the mentor teachers will not be needed until 1995,
and ``we're hoping by then the state will have its act together.''
   Also, regarding special education training, the prospective
teachers will complete the necessary classes. ``It's almost like a
double major,'' she said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Retracts Claim of Noriega Cocaine</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS grafs 4-5: ``One pentagon,'' to change ``peels'' to
``leaves'' and add comments of spokesman in Panama</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon on Tuesday retracted claims made
during the Panama invasion that U.S. soldiers had found a large
cache of cocaine in a guest house used by Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   ``It was not cocaine,'' said Pentagon spokesman Bob Hall.
   However, Hall told reporters that he could not identify with any
certainty what the substance was, saying he'd been supplied with
``less than satisfactory'' information by U.S. military officials
in Panama.
   One Pentagon official, who spoke on condition he not be
identified by name, said the substance had been found wrapped in
banana leaves and ``has something to do with voodoo.''
   Hall said U.S. officials were seeking further clarification on
the matter. The Washington Post reported in Tuesday editions that
the find amounted to tamales used in voodoo ceremonies. Southern
Command spokesman Capt. Art Haubold in Panama said experts had told
the command the substance was used in voodoo ceremonies _ and he
denied that the command had identified the find as tamales.
   Shortly after the invasion, Gen. Maxwell Thurman, commander of
the Panama-based Southern Command, said the cocaine amounted to 50
kilos, or more than 100 pounds. Thurman was quoted in a Dec. 23 New
York Times article as saying the presence of the cocaine was an
indication that Noriega ``condones or uses the stuff himself.''
   Hall, pressed about why such unchecked claims were allowed to be
made, said that ``clearly the guys who first saw this stuff did not
know what cocaine was. When the experts checked, they said it
wasn't.''
   Hall said he didn't know when that discovery had been made by
U.S. officials, nor could he explain how the claim came to be made.
   ``In retrospect, probably you shouldn't be announcing something.
... You need to do lab tests on things to be 100 percent sure,'' he
said.
   Hall said he could not provide any details about any other drugs
that might have been found during Operation Just Cause because of
``legal implications.''
   The day after the invasion, reporters were shown a so-called
``witch house'' that supposedly had been frequented by Noriega.
Col. Mike Snell, the officer in charge of the area, said some 50
pounds of cocaine had been found there, along with voodoo
paraphernalia.
   The Washington Post reported that although 450 kilos of cocaine
and assorted other drugs have been seized since U.S. troops invaded
Dec. 20, none could be directly linked to Noriega or used in the
drug-trafficking trial against him.
   Noriega is awaiting trial in Miami on federal drug-trafficking
and racketeering charges.
   Tamales are made from ground cornmeal, which is usually pale
beige or white, and filled with sweets, meat or cheese. They often
are wrapped in banana leaves and boiled. Cocaine, a white powder,
sometimes is packaged in plastic bags.
   On other matters related to Panama:
   _Hall, when asked about a report that two female soldiers had
refused to drive troops into an area where shooting was going on
during the invasion, said, ``The initial reading is, there is
nothing there.''
   Pentagon officials had said Friday that they were looking into
whether charges should be filed.
   ``They've been making an inquiry into this, whenever there is an
accusation of someone not performing their duties. .... The Army
will be making the facts known when they complete the inquiry,''
Hall said.
   _The DOD, Hall said, has approved a return to the standard tour
length for service members stationed in Panama, which is 36 months
for those with dependents and 24 for those without, effective June
1.
   The step reverses a policy that had been implemented to change
the tour lengths to reduce the number of dependents because of
political unrest.

   Hundreds of protesters in the Seattle area, San
Francisco and Washington, D.C., demonstrated Tuesday against U.S.
policy in El Salvador, hoping to make the issue a national priority
as Congress returns to work.
   ``We're just trying to send a very strong message to Congress
that El Salvador is still on the agenda,'' Daniel Eiben, a
spokesman for the No Mas! coalition, said in Seattle. ``No mas'' is
Spanish for ``no more.''
   More than 260 arrests were reported nationwide Tuesday. More
demonstrations are planned Wednesday and Thursday in other cities,
Eiben said.
   In Seattle, demonstrators surrounded the Jackson Federal
Building and blocked downtown traffic during the morning rush hour.
   The crowd of 200 people beat drums and chanted, ``Not a penny,
not a dime, funding death squads is a crime.'' One sign held up
read ``No U.S. $$ for death squad government in El Salvador.''
   Eighty-five people were arrested for blocking traffic or
entrance to the building. Police spokesman Mark Amundson said 69
would be cited for pedestrian interference and failure to disperse.
   Another 16 were arrested at the doors by the Federal Protective
Service and cited for failure to obey an officer and disturbing the
peace, said Bob Eberle, regional administrator for the General
Services Administration.
   There were no injuries or property damage.
   In Bellingham, about 100 miles north of Seattle, nine
demonstrators were arrested after protesters washed an American
flag and delayed people reporting for jury duty.
   In San Francisco, 136 people were arrested and traffic was
snarled for hours as more than 500 El Salvador demonstrators
blocked the entrances to the Federal Building.
   ``We're here because we want the U.S. to stop giving
one-and-a-half million dollars a day to kill people in El
Salvador,'' said protester Steve Harrison as he watched the
arrests. ``We're here to say we're not going to sit by and let it
happen.''
   Most of those arrested in San Francisco were cited for unlawful
assembly, said Police Chief Frank Jordan.
   In Washington, D.C., 37 people were arrested in the Capitol
Rotunda, including actor Martin Sheen. They kneeled, prayed,
chanted and refused to leave. They were arrested for demonstrating
within a capital building and unlawful entry.

<TEXT>
   More than 10,000 skilled workers held a rally
Tuesday to denounce communism for killing East German craftsmanship
and demand free-market reforms to revive it.
   ``We absolutely and unconditionally need conversion to a full
market economy,'' Burkhard Schmidt, spokesman for the Craftmen's
Union, told The Associated Press before the rally. Many of those
attending also favored reunification with West Germany.
   ``Better to close for four hours than forever,'' said Lutz
Scheibner, an electronics repairman. ``We need to show the
government we know what needs to be done.''
   The rally was called on short notice, over the opposition of top
union leaders still loyal to the Communist system that rewarded
them with comfortable bureaucratic positions.
   While Hans Modrow, the Communist premier, and opposition leaders
dicker over how to share power before free elections May 6, the
general attitude toward compromise has soured.
   Pro-democracy advocates from the Social Democratic Party and New
Forum declared Tuesday they were not prepared to negotiate a role
in the interim government and said coalition talks have been
postponed.
   Opposition reluctance to prop up the government reflects the
atmosphere of uncertainty in East Germany, which does not have a
unifying pro-democracy figure like Czechoslovakia's Vaclav Havel or
Lech Walesa of Poland.
   Since they have no obvious alternative to the distrusted
Communists, East Germans increasingly look to the West and call for
unification with prosperous West Germany.
   Up to 2,000 East Germans flee to the West every day, bleeding
the country of skilled workers and undermining chances for economic
recovery.
   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann was in East
Berlin for the first session of a joint economic council searching
for cooperative measures to bail East Germany out of its crisis.
   Haussmann told reporters that Modrow has agreed to accept West
German aid of 6 billion marks, or $3.5 billion, in the recovery
effort, which Bonn has tied to reforms that would allow more free
enterprise and foreign investment.
   Weekly rallies by hundreds of thousands of people have moved
from demanding reform to outright rejection of the Communist system
that has guided the nation through its entire four decades.
   ADN, the official news agency, said a clash between ``young
leftists'' and supporters of German unity was narrowly averted at
the rally of more than 100,000 people Monday in Leipzig, where zeal
for reform is strong.
   About 100 youths demonstrating against the rally's overwhelming
support for unification chanted slogans for continued East German
sovereignty and were chased by irate members of the crowd.
   Witnesses said only a priest's intervention ensured ``the
explosive situation did not escalate and end in violence,'' ADN
reported.
   Tuesday's rally in East Berlin and other demonstrations for
free-market reforms or reunification are quietly supported by West
German industry.
   Businesses in West Germany that seek access to cheaper labor and
a ready market have supported the effort to establish an
entrepreneurs' association in the East.
   Leaflets printed by the West German Council for Trade and
Industry were distributed at the rally held to announce a free
seminar on starting new businesses in East Germany.
   As at recent Monday night rallies in Leipzig, workers at the
Tuesday demonstration chanted demands for German unity and
denounced the interim government's search for compromise between a
planned economy and capitalism.
   ``There is no `third way,''' said Schmidt, the Craftsmen's Union
spokesman. ``Forty years of socialism has proved itself a failure
and there is no time for further experiments.''
   His comments were greeted by nods and denunciations of communism
from the crowd around him on the Alexanderplatz, in the heart of
East Berlin.
   Despite the short notice, thousands of independent shop managers
and skilled workers shut down their businesses to march. In the
crowd were artisans in leather aprons and beauticians in
aqua-colored uniforms.
   ``Taxes of 75 percent are death to our crafts,'' a placard
declared. Others read, ``Planned economy, no thanks'' and ``Down
with the Communists.''
   Under the old system, ``it was impossible for fathers to teach
their sons the crafts they had practiced for life,'' said Andreas
Wiench, a TV repairman. ``We need to cure this illness in our
economy.''
   Public demand for dissolution of the Communist Party has
increased in recent weeks and threatens the leadership of Modrow,
who has enjoyed relative public trust.
   The resignation of his finance minister after allegations of
irregularities added another stain to the party's image and one of
the most popular Communists, Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer of Dresden,
has left the party.
   Proposed regulations governing foreign investment have
disappointed both Westerners seeking joint projects and East German
businessmen who need cash and a freer hand to boost production.
   Continuing lack of incentive to turn out more for the state has
resulted in growing shortages.
   The State Office for Statistics said Tuesday the 1989 economic
performance was far short of targets, and some observers doubt the
credibility even of the 2 percent growth claimed in the report.

<HEAD>British School's Reversal Ends Religious Scarf Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALTRINCHAM, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Manchester area school on Tuesday
bowed to local Moslem criticism and partially lifted its ban on
Moslem head scarves after two sisters wearing them were kept out of
class for more than a month.
   They can wear blue ones, in keeping with the school's uniforms,
said officials at Altrincham Grammar School for Girls.
   ``We felt we had to take account of changes in our society,''
said Gil Thompson, chairman of the school governors. ``From time to
time it is necessary to change them (school rules) and we have
modified them.''
   Fatima Alvi, 16, and sister Aisha, 14, had been sent home every
school day since Dec. 14 when they began wearing their scarves to
the school in Altrincham, near Manchester about 160 miles northwest
of London.
   The public school initially argued that the scarves were a
safety danger to the girls in school laboratories and the
gymnasium. The new regulations still do not allow the scarves to be
worn in science and physical education classes, the governors said,
because of safety concerns.
   Islamic law requires girls past puberty to cover their heads in
the presence of men who are not close relatives. Three men teach at
the school of 727 students and there is a male caretaker.
   The Manchester Council of Mosques ruled in December that the
girls should conform to Islamic law.
   ``It was a very courageous decision to reverse the policy and
means the idea of British justice and fairness has been upheld,''
said council spokesman Ahmad Bashir.
   Abdur-rab Alvi, the girls' father, said he was pleased they
would be allowed to return to school Wednesday wearing scarves.
   ``It started as something in the family because the girls felt
strongly about it and it became something of countrywide
significance,'' Alvi said.
   The school has said there are 18 other Moslem pupils who have
not requested to wear scarves.
   Largely as a result of Asian immigration, Britain has 1.5
million Moslems.
   In France last October, three Moslem girls in Creil, north of
Paris, were banned from school because they refused to remove their
scarves. France's public school system bans all outward signs of
religion.
   The dispute sparked public demonstrations and became a national
political issue. France's highest administrative authority, the
Council of State, ruled in November that Moslem girls may wear
scarves to school as long as it causes no disruption.
   There are no laws forbidding religion in Britain's public
schools, and the Department of Education said uniform regulations
are decided by local school boards and teachers.

<HEAD>Moslem Fundamentalists Clash with Egyptian Police, One Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASSIUT, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Moslem fundamentalist, one of about 350
militants demonstrating outside a mosque, was shot to death during
a clash in which police used tear gas and demonstrators hurled
stones, officials said Tuesday.
   Attorney General Abdel-Aziz Mokhtar said 11 people were
arrested, most of them students at Assiut University, before the
crowd dispersed late Monday.
   Police initially blamed stray shots fired from within the crowd
for killing Abdel-Sabbour Hassanein and seriously wounding another
man.
   However, the Middle East News Agency later said police gunfire
killed Hassanein. ``The security forces were forced to open fire
after one of the demonstrators shot at them, and this led to the
death,'' MENA said.
   The university center of Assiut, about 240 miles south of Cairo,
has been a focal point of Moslem fundamentalist and extremist
activity since 1981, when militants attempted a coup in its streets
right after the assassination of President Anwar Sadat. More than
80 people died, mostly police.
   About 200 security troops accompanied Hassanein's body to his
hometown near Assiut for burial, apparently to prevent unrest
during the funeral.
   Police said they found iron rods, chains and knives inside the
mosque.
   The demonstration was to demand that former Interior Minister
Zaki Badr be put on trial. Some participants called for his
execution.
   Badr was fired on Jan. 12 after insulting Cabinet colleagues. A
public outcry rose for him to be tried on charges of violating
human rights and for other crimes.
   Badr led a harsh crackdown on religious fundamentalists after
becoming minister in 1986.
   Mokhtar said Tuesday that 20 Moslem activists detained for more
than five months were released. He gave no details.

   The 101st Congress convened its second session
Tuesday, facing an agenda suddenly expanded by the emergence of
democracy in Eastern Europe and a plan to cut Social Security taxes
at home.
   Lingering issues also abound, including child care,
capital-gains taxes and deficit reduction.
   Not waiting for President Bush to send up his own budget and
legislative proposals, the Senate almost immediately began debating
a far-reaching plan for cleaning up the air _ a bill that is more
costly and more sweeping than the president wants. Opposition is
based more on geography and competing regional interests than on
party lines.
   The House made plans for another confrontation on Wednesday, an
attempt to override Bush's veto of legislation aimed at preventing
the deportation of Chinese students who have sought refuge in the
United States. The House originally passed the bill on a 403-0 vote.
   ``There really is no good reason to override the president's
veto unless it is just straight-out politics,'' said Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. He said Bush has done as much
for the students through administrative actions as the bill would
do. But Republicans were generally conceding Bush faces a one-sided
defeat.
   The president, traveling in the Midwest, said he is hoping to
renew a spirit of cooperation with Congress. But he attacked as ``a
sheep in wolf's clothing'' an anti-crime bill sponsored by Sen.
Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
   ``It will be tougher on law enforcement than on criminals,''
Bush said of the bill. The measure generally would prohibit use of
tainted evidence, bar racially discriminatory executions and ban
sale of assault weapons.
   The first day of the session was marked by friendly reunions.
Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, told colleagues he'd nearly died of a
pancreas ailment during the long break, and he accepted hugs and
applause on the House floor.
   Outside, a half-dozen House members arrived on bicycles after a
two-block trip from a congressional office building to call
attention to plans for Earth Day in the spring.
   Democrat Craig Washington was sworn in to fill the term of the
late Rep. Mickey Leland, one day after a judge back in Texas
sentenced Washington to 30 days in jail, accusing him of leaving
legal clients ``in the lurch.'' Hearings have been scheduled for
Washington to show cause why he should not be sent to jail.
   On the other side of the Capitol, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., formally introduced a bill to reduce Social Security taxes
_ an idea that had prompted a full-scale White House attack when he
proposed it last month. Moynihan says workers are being deceived
because their Social Security taxes are being used to make the
federal deficit appear far smaller than it is.
   ``These are insurance contributions, they are premiums paid,''
Moynihan told a news conference. ``They do not belong to the
government. If we are not going to save them we should return
them.''
   His bill, which has drawn widespread interest but few sponsors,
would roll back the tax increase that took effect Jan. 1 and reduce
another scheduled for next ear. That would save a worker with
income over $51,300 about $600, and leave the Social Security
system with just enough money to pay retirees' checks, Moynihan
said.
   The Bush administration says such cuts would lead to reductions
in benefits or to efforts to raise other taxes.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, told
reporters Moynihan's proposal is ``developing what I think is
growing support.''
   But House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois said in a
letter to Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, that the proposed tax cut ``could inspire even
more drastic threats to the system and ultimately bring it down.''
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., a member of the Budget
Committee, did what is seldom done in Congress these days: He
introduced a bill proposing a tax increase. He recommended a 5
percent national sales tax that would exempt food, health care and
housing.
   Hollings said that would raise enough money to roll back Social
Security taxes, cut taxes on capital gains from stocks and bonds,
expand tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts and create a
revenue-sharing program for state and local education.
   In advance of Bush's budget, which will be submitted on Monday,
and his State of the Union message, which will follow on Jan. 31,
three of the president's top aides met with Republican senators to
discuss the wealth of issues facing Congress in this election year.
   Dole ticked off seven of those issues: the Chinese-student bill,
clean air, expanding child-care assistance, campaign financing
reform, Bush's proposed capital-gains tax reduction, tougher crime
legislation and the Social Security tax cut.
   Neither Dole's list nor one drawn by Mitchell mentioned what
likely will be attempts to send U.S. financial aid to the emerging
democracies of Eastern Europe. Most of the dramatic changes in
governments in that region took place after the 101st Congress
wrapped up its first session on Nov. 23.
   Dole has proposed that the U.S. foreign aid program be
overhauled to help those countries, even if that means cutting aid
to some long-time allies.
   The proposal encountered opposition from a group of Republican
senators who attended a luncheon meeting with Secretary of State
James A. Baker III.
   Sens. Robert W. Kasten Jr. of Wisconsin, Rudy Boschwitz of
Minnesota, Don Nickles of Oklahoma and Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania all told Baker they were opposed to the idea, a Senate
Republican source said.
   ``The meeting was not unfriendly,'' said the source, who
demanded anonymity. ``But not one person got up in support of
Dole's proposal.''

   The government's first conviction of a
hacker under a 1986 computer tampering law may bolster the
often-criticized statute, but experts said Tuesday it still needs
changes to improve computer security.
   Computer experts who testified during the trial of Robert T.
Morris and members of Congress said the 1986 law will most likely
be revised because it is vague and outdated.
   ``We still need to amend the act to resolve the ambiguities,''
said Theodore Hagelin, director of Syracuse University's Law
Technology and Management program.
   ``The fact that government has gotten a conviction takes some of
the pressure off Congress to do something immediately, but the law
as is remains insufficient,'' he said.
   Morris, 24, a suspended Cornell University graduate student from
Arnold, Md., was found guilty Monday of intentionally breaking into
a federal computer network without permission in November 1988 and
preventing use of the system.
   Morris admitted designing a ``worm'' to invade Internet, a
research network of about 6,000 computers nationwide that links
government, military and major universities. However, he said a
programming error caused his program to replicate wildly and
paralyze the system.
   He was the first person brought to trial under a section of the
1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act dealing with illegal access to
federal computer networks.
   The law makes it a felony to ``intentionally access a federal
interest computer without authorization and alter, destroy or
damage information,'' or prevent authorized use of the computer if
such conduct causes the loss of $1,000 or more during any one-year
period.
   The law applies only to U.S. government computers, computers of
financial institutions and networks involving computers in more
than one state.
   Joseph B. Tompkins Jr., chairman of the American Bar
Association's Task Force on Computer Crime, said the law fails to
cover viruses that authorized users may release, either mistakenly
or deliberately, but without malice.
   Another unresolved question is whether a hacker can be
prosecuted if he sends a program with a hidden virus to an
electronic bulletin board and other users transfer the
virus-infected software into their own systems.
   In his instructions to the jury, U.S. District Judge Howard
Munson said the government did not have to prove intent to convict
Morris.
   But Tompkins said, ``Because (the judge) ruled that way doesn't
mean another judge in another court won't rule differently. Or,
that the same battles over intent won't go back and forth.
   ``The ambiguities and gaps are still there. Congress has some
work to do,'' said Tompkins.
   Eugene Spafford, a computer science professor at Purdue
University, one of several major universities that suffered the
worm's attack, said security systems on computers have to be
improved.
   ``But until that's accomplished we have to depend on legal means
to serve as a deterrent,'' said Spafford, a government witness at
the trial.
   Spafford also said there are problems the law does not currently
cover.
   ``High-tech crimes. How do you investigate and prosecute crimes
where immediacy is so important or where it's difficult to trace it
back to the perpetrator? Viruses don't leave fingerprints,'' said
Spafford.
   Also, there is no specific mention of viruses or worms in the
law, said Tompkins.
   Dean Krafft, in charge of security at Cornell's computer science
department, said any new law should specify what constitutes a
crime. He suggested Congress may want to provide several levels of
criminal action.
   ``A student trying to access a computer game at another
university who somehow causes that system to crash shouldn't have
to face a felony'' charge, said Krafft, who also was a government
witness.
   Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J., the main sponsor of the 1986
legislation, said there was no question the issue needed to be
reconsidered and that his proposal was never intended to be the
last word on computer trespassing.
   But Hughes said was he pleased to see the law work, despite the
complaints.
   Congress is likely to return to the question of computer
security this session.
   The House Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice heard
testimony on three anti-virus bills last session, but postponed
work until the conclusion of the Morris trial, said Eric Hauser, an
aide to Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., the subcommittee chairman.

   Thousands of coupons for everything from soap to
soup have turned a federal courtroom into a coupon clipper's dream
during the trial of a woman accused of mail fraud and conspiracy to
distribute fake coupons.
   Coupons are stacked in boxes between the judge's bench and
lawyers' tables in the trial of Connie Arvidson, who faces up to 30
years in prison and fines up to $1.5 million if convicted of all
charges against her.
   Final arguments were scheduled for Wednesday in the U.S.
District Court jury trial that began Jan. 8.
   Mrs. Arvidson, 34, of Boca Raton, Fla., is a self-described
trash scavenger whose obsession for coupons grew into a profitable
business, prosecutors said.
   She and nine others were indicted in June 1989 in an alleged $2
million counterfeit scam. According to the indictment, coupons for
food and other products were printed and distributed nationwide
from Texas.
   Mrs. Arvidson, known as ``Coupon Connie'' and the ``Dumpster
Lady,'' is accused of knowingly buying and distributing fake
coupons. She maintains she is innocent.
   Boxes of coupons stacked 4 feet high in the courtroom are the
nightmare of 47 companies whose coupons allegedly were
counterfeited and distributed illegally through the mail.
   Mrs. Arvidson is on trial with David Rees and James Floyd
Richards, both of San Antonio. The seven others indicted in the
case have agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for
leniency. Several of them have testified against Mrs. Arvidson.
   Charges against Rees and Richards relate to the alleged printing
and distribution of coupons, prosecutors said
   Mrs. Arvidson has turned down two plea bargains that would have
sent her to jail for up to 18 months.
   ``We are counting down to the end, so I am getting stronger,''
Mrs. Arvidson said. ``I know the jury's going to let me go home and
be with my little girl.''
   Mrs. Arvidson, who has estimated she pulled in $200 a week at
her rebating peak, said the expense of the trial combined with a
recent bank foreclosure on her property have forced her to file for
bankruptcy.
   ``I just want the trial to end,'' she said. ``I can't borrow
anymore money from relatives to stay in a cockroach motel here. I
have no money for anything.''
   Mrs. Arvidson said she plans never to clip another
coupon.``There's more to life than just coupons,'' she said Monday
night.

   Death row inmate Clarence Brandley was
freed on bond Tuesday, one month after an appeals court threw out
his conviction on charges of raping and killing a teen-ager in a
case tainted by racism.
   ``I was doubtful this day would ever come,'' Brandley said as he
left the Ellis 1 Unit prison, which houses Texas' death row. ``I'm
very thankful. I'm going to take it one day at a time.''
   Brandley's release came just hours after a state judge in Conroe
set his bond at $75,000 and one month after the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals threw out Brandley's capital murder conviction,
saying he didn't receive a fair trial.
   Brandley's attorneys have offered evidence that police and
Montgomery County prosecutors had set out to prove that Brandley,
the only black janitor at Conroe High School, where the victim was
killed, was guilty rather than seeking the young white woman's real
killer. Montgomery County officials have denied the allegations.
   Brandley's release had been delayed while Peter Speers, the
district attorney in Montgomery County, filed motions asking the
appeals court to reconsider. The appeals court rejected those pleas
last week.
   ``I wouldn't say this is a vindication of the system,'' said
Brandley, who has been on death row since March 1981.
   Speers said he would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but won't
seek a new trial for Brandley if the nation's highest court refuses
to consider the case.
   The appeals court decision in December came more than two years
after a special judge concluded that Brandley's conviction was
tainted by racism.
   The victim, 16-year-old Cheryl Dee Fergeson, a Bellville High
School volleyball team manager, was slain while attending a
tournament at Conroe High School in August 1980.
   Brandley's first trial ended in a hung jury, and an all-white
jury convicted him of capital murder in his second trial.
   Speers has repeatedly indicated a third trial would be virtually
impossible because of the time that has elapsed, lost evidence and
what he terms corrupted witnesses.
   In another development, the former janitor who found Miss
Fergeson's body, has been charged with sexually assaulting two
girls last year, authorities said.
   Henry Peace, who was a co-worker of Brandley's at Conroe High
School, was arrested Friday and charged with five counts of sexual
assault, said O.J. Stewart, sheriff in Liberty County, which is
near Montgomery County.
   Prosecutors said there is no evidence linking Peace to Miss
Fergeson's slaying.
   Peace testified in the Brandley case, but gave conflicting
testimony during several court hearings.
   Brandley, 38, said he wanted to see his mother. His attorneys
refused to disclose the location of the reunion.
   ``When I get home with my family, I'll kiss the ground,'' said
Brandley. ``But it's a great feeling just walking outside the gate,
knowing I'm standing on some grass, not concrete. And no nonstop
handcuffs.''
   He said he hopes to get involved in helping people in
circumstances similar to his _ ``people who have been hurt, people
who have felt injustice may have been made.''
   Asked if he was bitter, he responded: ``I think anyone would be
bitter. But after a period of time, that passes.''
   Brandley said he did not sleep Monday night after learning he
likely would be released.
   ``I've been just up and anxious for this big moment to come.
I've been just anxious for this moment,'' he said.
   When he walked out the door, inmates in the prison recreation
area waved and hollered ``Way to go Clarence!''
   ``The hardest part was getting someone to listen in the
beginning,'' said his attorney, Mike DeGeurin.

   Jewish refugees from strife-torn Soviet
Azerbaijan arrived Tuesday, and officials said they are speeding
efforts to rescue others caught up in a revolt by the predominantly
Moslem population.
   The refugees from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, who arrived
early Tuesday, said the whole Jewish community of about 20,000
seemed eager to emigrate, but most denied any pattern of
anti-Semitism in the violence.
   At least 170 people were killed and more than 600 were wounded
in the southern Soviet republic since ethnic riots by Moslem
Azerbaijanis against Christian Armenians exploded in Baku Jan. 13.
Open warfare broke out between them along the Armenian-Azerbaijani
border.
   Soviet officials said Jews and Russians were among the victims
of riots and demostrations in Baku, and Israeli reports said three
Jews were killed.
   Matatia Elizarov, a 39-year-old grocer who arrived from Baku on
a flight via Hungary, said he did not feel the Azerbaijani
population was hostile toward Jews.
   ``They were telling us: you, Jews, are like brothers to us. You
just live quietly, and when you emigrate you leave your apartments
and other possessions behind. You don't want to take our land like
the Armenians,'' Elizarov said.
   Still, Jews felt they were caught in the middle of the conflict
and wanted to leave in increasing numbers, he said in a telephone
interview from the northern port of Haifa.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said his government has taken
measures ``to get Jews out of there sooner.
   ``Last week we transferred a large number of emigration
invitations, so they won't have formal problems,'' he said on a
tour of immigrant resettlement sites in Jerusalem.
   Gad Ben-Ari, spokesman for the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency
that helps handle immigration, said any emigration invitation from
Israel to a Jew in Azerbaijan is getting top priority processing.
Such invitations from abroad are necessary to start emigration
procedures.
   ``There are no signs of active anti-Semitism at the moment, but
we are worried Jews would be hurt because of the overall
situation,'' he said.
   Elizarov said he has requests for emigration invitations from
his three brothers, a sister and 50 other Jewish families.
   Other Baku Jews who arrived with Elizarov early Tuesday on the
flight from Budapest told reporters aboard the plane that they
believe all the Jews of Azerbaijan would eventually emigrate.
   Some reported incidents of hostility by Azerbaijani nationalists.
   Nathan Sherinoff, a trumpet player, said slogans painted on the
walls in Baku read: ``We give the Armenians one year, the Russians
three years, the Jews five years.''
   But the approach appeared ambivalent, with Moslem nationalists
also pressing the Jews to join them in fighting against Armenians
and the Soviets, he said.
   Elizarov, who left Baku shortly before the riots broke out with
his wife Marbari, 34, and four children, said the exodus was also
motivated by the lack of basic products and total disbelief in the
capacity of the Soviet government to restore order.
   ``There is even no canned meat in the city ... and people don't
believe in anything any more; they don't trust all this talk,'' he
said.

   The junk dealer thrust into the middle
of a mail bombing investigation is a part-time preacher whose
former job as an insurance agent indirectly led authorities to him.
   Federal agents have searched Robert Wayne O'Ferrell's warehouse,
salvage business and home, looking for evidence in the deaths of a
federal judge in suburban Birmingham and a civil rights lawyer in
Savannah, Ga., who were killed when they opened package bombs
mailed to them.
   No one has been arrested in the bombings and FBI agent Chuck
Archer on Tuesday declined to describe O'Ferrell as a suspect. ``He
is one of many people we have interviewed,'' Archer said.
   A person or group claimed responsibility for the bombings _
thought to be racially motivated _ in a letter to an Atlanta
television station.
   O'Ferrell, 46, spoke to reporters briefly Tuesday, and said the
FBI had asked him not to talk to the media until they are finished
with their search.
   ``I don't know anything about any of it,'' O'Ferrell said. ``I
don't have anything to hide.''
   O'Ferrell, a tall, silver-haired man, lives in a small wooden
house about six miles west of Enterprise with his wife, Mary. The
couple has two daughters, Tammy, 20, and Danielle, 13. They keep a
few horses in a makeshift barn and a dozen Collie dogs play in
their fenced backyard.
   Archer said O'Ferrell was questioned Monday and again Tuesday,
while agents dug up septic tansks at his home and warehouse and
continued executing search warrants. Search warrants have been
approved for property other than O'Ferrell's but Archer did not
identify the property.
   O'Ferrell said agents were looking for a typewriter he may have
sold. Sources close to the investigation, who asked not to be
named, confirmed published reports that said the typewriter used to
prepare some of his legal documents matched the type found in mail
bomb correspondence.
   O'Ferrell sued his former employer, Gulf Life Insurance Co. of
Jacksonville, Fla., seeking insurance benefits. The case was heard
on appeal by Vance, who was on the three-judge panel that upheld a
lower court's ruling against O'Ferrell.
   County Commissioner Sid Avery said O'Ferrell was his insurance
agent and served him well.
   ``If he is guilty of this, it would be a surprise to me. I never
had a reason to build him up or put him down,'' Avery said.
   ``There's always going to be somebody who doesn't like you or me
or whoever, and you're going to find it in this case,'' said Lem
Pope, owner of a dry-goods store along nearby New Brockton's main
street. ``But by and large, I think most people think he was a nice
guy.''
   O'Ferrell's pastor, Arthur Emfinger of the Bethel Baptist
Church, said the junk dealer is a church leader who preaches before
other congregations.
   ``He could be as crooked as everything, but they'd have to prove
it to me,'' Emfinger said.
   Shirley Eads of New Brockton was among a group of spectators
outside the Enterprise warehouse being searched by FBI agents. She
described O'Ferrell as being moody.
   ``He didn't have any friends, none that I know of,'' she said.
``Sometimes he would talk to you and sometimes he wouldn't say a
word.''

   Tough anti-drug talk from President Bush
won praise from community activists and police in the Mississippi
River city Bush said ``refused to surrender to the drug plague.''
   Bush visited two blocks of some of Kansas City's roughest
streets, where dealers peddled crack cocaine under a basketball
hoop before neighbors took down the basket and chased out much of
their business.
   Later, he spoke to about 1,300 law enforcement officials in a
downtown auditorium, saying cooperation between police and the
community could win major battles against drugs.
   ``People in this town refused to surrender to the drug plague.
You took back what's yours. Took back your kids. Took back your
streets,'' Bush said.
   Bush _ along with U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh,
federal drug czar William Bennett and other dignitaries _ came to
Kansas City to meet members of the Ad Hoc Group Against Crime, a
community organization that works with authorities to close drug
houses.
   ``What (Bush) really did was give us a pep talk and congratulate
us for what we have done _ and acknowledge that there's a long way
to go,'' Ad Hoc member P. Albert Williams said after the
president's speech.
   The federal government estimates that Kansas City ranks sixth in
the nation in availability of crack. Ranked 29th in metropolitan
population, the city had the ninth-highest murder rate in the
country last year, according to FBI figures.
   ``To me, it's a genocide,'' Williams said. ``If we keep up the
drugs, we're going to kill ourselves.''
   At the speech to police, Bush stressed tough penalties for
dealers.
   Police officers said the president's visit meant a little
recognition for their work and showed a commitment to fight drugs.
   ``I think we've had some success here in Kansas City and for the
president to show his commitment to our work I think is going to be
important,'' said police Sgt. Rick McLaughlin. ``It's nice to feel
that you're appreciated.''
   Ad Hoc formed about 12 years ago to ease tensions between blacks
and police. Today, the group founded by city human relations
Director Alvin Brooks marches around suspected drug houses and
shouts down dealers with bullhorns. The group set up a hotline for
citizens to report when new drug houses spring up.
   ``Our emphasis has been to try to raise the level of awareness
and consciousness about what drugs and related crimes and violence
are doing to our community, and we attack those crack houses,''
Brooks told the president.
   Guided by Brooks in an inner-city area, Bush visited a tree with
a basketball backboard attached to it. The hoop has been stripped
away by neighbors because it attracted drug dealers.
   Nearby, members of Black Men Together, an anti-crime group
affliated with Ad Hoc, demonstrated their chant to harass dealers:
``Change! Change! Change! You better run, dope pusher, you better
run!''

   Libya said Tuesday that authorities at
Frankfurt Airport have detained a Libyan airliner, arrested and
searched its crew, and that police beat some passengers, the Middle
East News Agency reported.
   In West Germany, officials with the Foreign Ministry, border
authorities and Frankfurt airport police declined to comment on the
report.
   In a dispatch from Tripoli, Libya's capital, MENA quoted a
Libyan government official as saying German police kept the
Frankfurt local manager of the Libyan Airline from approaching the
plane, identified as a Boeing 737.
   The official also alleged that German policemen insulted and
beat some of the passengers, MENA reported.
   ``The Libyan plane and its crew are still under detention up
until now and authorities at Frankfurt Airport have refused to give
a reason for the measure,'' the official was quoted as saying,
without himself volunteering an explanation.
   He said Libyan authorities presented a ``strongly worded''
protest to the West German envoy in Tripoli, calling the move
``unjustified,'' MENA reported.
   The unidentified Libyan official did not say when the plane was
detained but observers presumed he meant Tuesday.
   He also did not report on how many passengers were aboard, their
present situation or their nationalities.
   Wilhelm Dreyer, a duty officer at the Interior Ministry in Bonn,
told The Associated Press that portions of the Libyan report were
true, but said the Frankfurt prosecutor's office ordered officials
to disclose no immediate details of the incident to the press or
public.
   ``I know that a plane landed as scheduled and there was a
delay,'' Dreyer said.
   The ministry is responsible for police and border authorities.
   ``I do not know if the aircraft is still there or if the report
that it was detained is true,'' Dreyer said when called shortly
before 3 a.m.
   He referred all further inquiries to the Frankfurt prosecutor's
after the start of normal business hours on Wednesday.
   A duty officer at the Foreign Ministry in Bonn, who refused to
give his name, said he knew nothing more of the incident that he
learned from press inquiries.
   Asked about Libyan allegations that passengers were beaten and
humiliated, he said: ``I am not authorized to disclose any
information. But I would treat such a report with great caution.''
   West Germany has maintained strong trade relations with Libya,
despite the radical North African nation's volatile ties to the
United States and its Western allies.
   U.S. officials last year accused West German businesses of
having provided the technical know-how and equipment for what
Washington believed to be a poison gas plant near Tripoli, Libya.
Libya said the facility was a pharmaceutical plant.

awards announced Tuesday by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences.
   The Wescam Camera System, invented by John Leavitt and developed
by Istec Inc., allows cameras to operate on moving vehicles without
the shaking or jitter being transmitted from the vehicle to the
camera.
   The camera system earned an Academy plaque, as did the makers of
a new sound-dubbing machine, a high-speed camera, a programmable
camera support system and a mobile camera platform.
   The technical achievement certificate went to Leo Catozzo for
designing a film-saving splicing tool. A special commendation was
given to the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers for
establishing industry standards.
   The awards are for devices, methods, formulas, discoveries or
inventions of special value which also have a proven history of use
in the industry.
   The technical and scientific awards will be presented March 3.
Nominations for the main Oscars are to be revealed Feb. 14, and the
winners are to be honored March 26.

   A Massachusetts company and three of its top
executives were indicted Tuesday on federal charges of illegally
exporting missile guidance parts to Taiwan.
   The indictment accuses TRT International Co., of Ashland, Mass.,
and its vice president, Rudy Yujen Tsai, also of Ashland, with one
count of conspiracy and three counts of illegal exports in
violation of the Arms Export Control Act.
   In addition, the grand jury charged David Rosen, also of
Ashland, a former TRT officer, and Tommy Tsai, of Framingham,
Mass., each with conspiracy and two counts of illegal exports.
   The indictment alleges the defendants bought parts used in the
guidance systems of Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and Maverick
air-to-surface missiles from the Pennsylvania Optical Co., of
Reading, and exported them to Taiwan without State Department
approval from March 1987 to July 1989.
   The parts were sent to Chung-Shan Institute of Science and
Technology in Taiwan, the indictment said.
   Telephone calls to TRT International and Rudy Tsai's home for
comment were not answered Tuesday afternoon.
   If convicted, the company faces a maximum $3.5 million fine.
Rudy Tsai could be sentenced to 35 years in jail and fined $3.25
million. Tommy Tsai and Rosen each face 25 years in jail and a
$2.25 million fine if conficted.

   About 2,000 ethnic Albanians
demonstrated in the capital of Kosovo province Tuesday and demanded
an end to alleged human rights abuses in the region, the state
Tanjug news agency reported.
   The demonstrators, most of them students from Pristina
University, marched in silence from their dormitories to the
downtown government building, said a local journalist, who declined
to be identified.
   They asked to meet with high-ranking party and government
officials to hand them an eight-point list of demands, including an
immediate stop to ``political trials, police brutality and the
release of political prisoners.''
   They also called for a change in what they described as
``anti-Albanian discrimination'' and for free elections in Kosovo,
the source said.
   The demonstrators dispersed peacefully two hours after a
government official promised them that Rahman Morina, Kosovo's
communist party chief, would met with a delegation of the students
Wednesday morning.
   At least 28 people have died in violence that erupted in the
province last year following constitutional changes that limited
the region's autonomy and gave Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest
republic, near-total control over its administration.
   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians _ about 90 percent of Kosovo's 1.9
million people _ were jailed in the police crackdown that followed.
   A partial state of emergency, which authoritiies assert is
necessary to protect the Serbian minority, remains in force in the
region.
   Azem Vlasy, the province's former political leader, and 14 other
ethnic Albanians are currently standing trial for allegedly
engaging in ``counterrevolutionary activities'' and inciting
violence.
   International rights organizations and the media in Yugoslavia's
liberal northern states of Croatia and Slovenia have repeatedly
claimed major violations of rights are common in the region, and
blamed Serbians for them.
   Slovenian Communists, backed by their Croatian counterparts, on
Monday split from the Federal Communist Party dominated by Serbia,
citing irreconcilable ideological differences.

   A former model who cooperated with the FBI in
the arrest of Mayor Marion Barry on a cocaine possession charge
testified Tuesday before a federal grand jury considering further
criminal charges.
   Rasheeda Moore, 38, who law enforcement sources have said called
Barry to the hotel room where he was arrested, appeared before the
closed grand jury session for 2{ hours. She entered and left the
U.S. Courthouse under tight security.
   While her testimony was secret, Ms. Moore has previously told
investigators that she and Barry had used cocaine on numerous
occasions during a lengthy relationship, including a 1988 trip to
the Virgin Islands, according to law enforcement sources.
   The mayor, in sworn grand jury testimony last year, denied
allegations of drug use, said the sources, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   They said that her story corroborates statements by convicted
drug dealer Charles Lewis.
   Lewis, who was sentenced to 15 months in prison last Friday on
drug charges, is also cooperating with the continuing federal
investigation of Barry, which sources say involves allegations of
perjury by the mayor.
   Under federal law, the testimony of at least two witnesses is
necessary in a perjury case involving a defendant's sworn
statements.
   Barry left the nation's capital on Monday for a Florida
rehabilitation center after turning over his day-to-day municipal
duties to the city administrator.
   The probe of allegations of drug use by Barry began more than a
year ago when the U.S. attorney's office received allegations that
Barry and Lewis had smoked crack cocaine in a downtown hotel.
   Police who went to a hotel on Dec. 22, 1988, to investigate
reports that Lewis was selling drugs from his room left when they
discovered Barry was there.
   That hotel is located just blocks away from the one where the
mayor was arrested last Thursday night on a misdemeanor charge of
possessing crack cocaine.
   The yearlong investigation was stymied by the inability of
prosecutors to obtain evidence to corroborate Lewis' testimony that
he had sold Barry cocaine and had smoked it with the mayor on
numerous occasions, including a 1988 trip the mayor took to the
Virgin Islands.
   Following Barry's court appearance last Friday, U.S. Attorney
Jay B. Stephens signaled that his office would consider bringing
other charges.
   The arrest was ``part of an ongoing public corruption probe,''
Stephens told reporters. ``I view this not as the end of an event
but as part of an ongoing investigation.''
   The FBI's investigation is also focusing on allegations of
contract fraud within City Hall, where several top aides to the
mayor have been convicted and gone to prison in the past decade on
corruption charges.
   The sting operation that led to Barry's arrest was approved at
the highest levels of the FBI and was planned to counter any
defense claims that the mayor was the victim of entrapment, sources
said.
   Ms. Moore was instructed not to suggest drug use when the mayor
arrived at the hotel room rented by the FBI, sources said. She was
also advised not to use cocaine herself during the mayor's visit.
   According to an FBI affidavit filed in support of the charge,
Barry inquired about the availability of cocaine. He then purchased
the cocaine from an undercover agent who had obtained it from the
Drug Enforcement Administration, the affidavit said.
   Meanwhile, Stephens filed court papers Tuesday opposing a
request by Barry's lawyers to suspend court-ordered weekly drug
testing while the mayor is in a Florida treatment center.
   As an alternative, a document filed with the court by Stephens
said the mayor could undergo the tests through a federal pre-trial
services agency in West Palm Beach, where the rehabilitation center
is located.
   U.S. Magistrate Deborah Robinson has not ruled on the issue.
   Barry, in a statement issued Tuesday by his Washington office,
asked the media to ``back away'' from the Hanley-Hazelden treatment
center.
   He said that he and his family were undergoing a ``demanding and
painful ordeal,'' and asked that reporters not make it any worse.
He asked the media to stay away ``for the sake of my privacy and
that of others.''

   EL CENTRO, Calif. (AP) _ Two Navy Blue Angels jets collided over
the Superstition Mountains during a training exercise Tuesday,
causing one of the planes to crash, authorities said.
   Elsewhere, an Air Force jet crashed near a busy highway
cloverleaf in Austin, Texas, and a pilot in an Air National Guard
jet clipped radio guy wires during a training flight in Hutchinson,
Kan.
   The pilot of the Blue Angels' F-A18 ejected safely before the
aircraft went into the mountains about 12:30 p.m. about 20 miles
northwest of this Southern California city, said El Centro Naval
Air Facility spokesman Mike Ray.
   The Navy precision flying team uses the desert base as a winter
training center to practice the daredevil routines it performs at
air shows throughout the country.
   The planes involved in the collision were part of a
four-aircraft diamond formation at the time of the accident, Ray
said. Three of the aircraft, including the other one involved in
the collision, returned safely to the base.
   The downed plane's pilot, Marine Capt. Chase Moseley, was flown
by helicopter to the El Centro Regional Medical Center, Ray said.
   Moseley was reported in good shape.
   In Austin, a two-man crew of an RF-4C reconnaisance jet ejected
safely before the aircraft slammed into a grassy area near two busy
highways during the afternoon rush hour, snarling traffic and
producing a mushroom cloud of smoke and grass fires.
   ``It's a godsend that nothing on the ground was hit and no one
was hurt,'' said Jerry Reed, a police communications supervisor.
   The pilot, Capt. Hal S. Goldsmith, 32, and his weapons officer,
1st Lt. Robert B. Brumley, 25, suffered minor injuries and were
taken to a hospital at Bergstrom Air Force Base where they are
based, said a base spokesman, Capt. Guy Thompson.
   The two were on a routine training mission, the Air Force said.
The cause of the crash was under investigation.
   In Kansas, the pilot of a Kansas Air National Guard F-16 jet
fighter landed safely after striking two steel cables hanging from
the tower of radio station KHUT-FM in Hutchinson, about 40 miles
northwest of Wichita, authorities said.
   ``The Guard safety officer told me the wires first hit the
canopy. That's only six inches above the guy's head. That's how
close he came to being decapitated,'' said KHUT chief engineer
Randy Mettlen.
   The Air National Guard refused to release the name of the pilot,
who was not injured.
   The pilot was returning to McConnell Air Force Base, where the
plane is based, from a training mission nearby, said a base
spokesman, Lt. Col. Paul Muehring.
   ``The pilot apparently saw the tower in time to avoid it, but he
was unable to avoid the guy wires,'' Muehring said.
   Navy Lt. Greg Stroh, a Blue Angels supply officer who was at the
hospital, said Moseley suffered only facial brusies and cuts in the
ejection and would be released later in the day.
   The F-A18 that crashed was destroyed.
   The accident is the first involving the Blue Angels since
February 1987, when a single FA-18 jet crashed during practice
maneuvers. Ray said the pilot in that accident bailed out safely.

<TEXT>
   A state appeals court Tuesday cleared
the way for results of a sobriety test failed by former Exxon
Valdez skipper Joseph Hazelwood to be admitted as evidence in his
trial.
   The Alaska Court of Appeals denied without explanation
Hazelwood's request for review of a lower court decision that
results of the blood-alcohol test are admissible.
   Hazelwood's trial is scheduled to start Monday in Anchorage
Superior Court.
   His attorneys argued that results of the test were inadmissible
as evidence because it was given illegally and the amount of time
elapsed between the Exxon Valdez crash and the testing made the
results of questionable worth.
   The Exxon Valdez struck a reef March 24 and spilled nearly 11
million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound.
   Hazelwood, who was not on the bridge at the time, underwent the
Coast Guard-administered sobriety test aboard the ship about 10
hours later. The test revealed a blood-alcohol level of .061. The
legal limit for operators of vessels such as tankers is .04, the
Coast Guard said.
   Hazelwood's attorneys challenged the sobriety test on grounds it
was administered according to federal rather than state law. They
also said Hazelwood did not consent to the test.
   One of Hazelwood's attorneys, Dick Madson, said use of the test
results will be appealed if Hazelwood is convicted.
   ``If he's convicted, we will appeal everything,'' Madson said.
   Hazelwood faces a felony charge of criminal mischief and
misdemeanor charges of negligent discharge of oil, reckless
endangerment and operating a vessel while intoxicated.
   The felony charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in
prison and a $5,000 fine. The misdemeanor charges' combined maximum
penalties total 2{ years in prison and $11,000 in fines.

   Authorities persuaded dissident workers
occupying a Ford assembly plant outside the capital to leave
Monday, and officials said two union leaders were charged in an
attack that killed one worker and halted production.
   Workers at the Ford Motor Co. plant at Cuautitlan, 15 miles to
the north, blame the attack two weeks ago on union leader Hector
Uriarte. They accuse him of being pro-management and allege the
Mexican Labor Federation put him in office after a fraudulent
election.
   The state of Mexico's attorney general, Humberto Benitez, said
Monday a warrant has been issued for Uriarte's arrest charging him
with masterminding the violence. The state of Mexico abuts the
federal district that incorporates much of metropolitan Mexico City.
   Workers left peacefully when ordered out by the assistant
attorney general of the state of Mexico, Roberto Pineda Gomez, the
Excelsior news service said.
   It was not clear when employees will return to work, and there
was no immediate comment from Ford. A complaint filed by Ford
prompted the eviction, state of Mexico spokesman Cesar Silva said.
   The plant, which makes 450 cars and trucks a day for the Mexican
market, closed Jan. 8 when from 150 to 250 thugs entered the plant
and shot and beat workers as they arrived for the morning shift.
   Ten workers were injured; one died two days later.
   Ford shut down production, saying there was no security for
workers.
   About 1,500 workers occupied the plant, 15 miles north of Mexico
City, saying they were protecting installations and the plant's
3,800 jobs, and demanding Uriarte's ouster.
   When police arrived at 5 a.m. Monday, about 300 workers were at
the plant, Excelsior said.
   ``I come in the name of the law and accompanied by the public
force! Workers, I ask you to voluntarily turn over the
installations you have illegally occupied!'' Pineda yelled to
workers over a bullhorn.
   He told them Jose Guadalupe Uribe Guevara, union leader of a
minibus line that brought thugs in for the attack, and nine others
had been arrested and charged in the attack, Excelsior said. The
charges include homicide, assault and weapons violations.
   Workers applauded but urged that Uriarte also be arrested.
   Uriarte was working at Mexican Labor Confederation headquarters
in Mexico City on Monday morning, said Fidel Velazquez, head of the
organization to which the Ford union belongs. Velazquez said he had
not heard about the warrant.
   A complaint filed by Ford over workers' occupation of the plant
prompted the eviction, state of Mexico spokesman Cesar Silva said.
   Workers at Ford plants in the northern cities of Hermosillo and
Chihuahua, who belong to the same union, have not been involved in
the dispute.

   About 50 Sea World workers were suspended after
an internal investigation into allegations of thefts and drug
abuse, officials said.
   ``Like any company, we're concerned about things like theft and
drugs and don't look at that kindly,'' Sea World spokesman Dan
LeBlanc said Sunday. ``We feel that we owe our employees, as would
any company, a safe and drug-free environment in which to work.
That was our true motivation for doing this.''
   The 50 employees were suspended with pay last week, but said
that not all of them are suspected of wrongdoing. Some are
witnesses, he said.
   The investigation was conducted by Narcorp, a private undercover
firm.
   He said neither the park's guests nor animals were affected by
the suspensions.
   He said the suspended employees were ``mostly kids'' working in
low-level positions. The majority of the park's year-round staff of
about 2,000 workers is made up of young people, he said.
   LeBlanc said park management is contemplating whether to contact
police.
   ``Some of them, what they did was just too much. They'll
probably be let go. Others, I hope, like in the case of drugs,
we'll offer to pay for rehab and that sort of thing,'' he said.
   He declined to describe how widespread the problems of theft and
drugs are.
   ``We were relieved to find the problem was not as extensive as
it might have been, given today's climate, particularly in the area
of drugs,'' he said.

   President Bush assured 75,000 abortion opponents marching in the
nation's capital he was their ally, and demonstrators on both sides
held rallies around the country on the 17th anniversary of Roe vs.
Wade.
   In a telephone hookup to demonstrators across from the White
House, Bush spoke Monday ``of the self-evident moral superiority of
adoption over abortion,'' and said he opposed the 1973 Supreme
Court ruling that legalized abortion.
   In Sacramento, Calif., a state senator prohibited by her bishop
from receiving Communion for her stand in favor of abortion rights
told a flag-waving rally of 1,000 not to be discouraged by the
president's stand.
   ``We'll get our message all the way to the White House, where
Barbara Bush sits in quiet support,'' said California Sen. Lucy
Killea. ``Mr. President, please, read your wife's lips.'' Mrs. Bush
has refused to answer interviewers' questions about her views on

   U.S. officials are assuring the Nicaraguan
Contras they can count on additional U.S. humanitarian assistance
regardless of the outcome of next month's national elections in
that country.
   A $50 million aid program is due to expire just days after the
Feb. 25 elections, but legislative ground rules allow aid
deliveries to continue through March. The upcoming expiration of
the program has produced speculation that aid to the Contras may
finally end after almost 10 years.
   If the opposition coalition led by presidential candidate
Violeta Chamorro wins the election, it is widely expected the
rebels will return peacefully to Nicaragua from their base camps in
Honduras.
   In that event, renewed U.S. aid would be designed to help the
reintegration process, said the U.S. officials, asking not to be
identified.

   A jury convicted a one-time graduate
student of computer tampering for unleashing a rogue ``worm'' that
wiggled into a federal computer network and caused millions of
dollars in down-time and damage.
   Robert T. Morris, 24, of Arnold, Md., on Monday became the first
person convicted under the 1986 federal Computer Fraud and Abuse
Act. He could be sentenced to a maximum five years in prison and
$250,000 fine.
   Prosecutors declined to say what they would recommend. They also
wouldn't say what effect the verdict might have on computer
security or whether it would fuel a push for stronger laws against
hackers.
   Morris broke into the Internet computer system on Nov. 2, 1988.
The worm did not destroy any data, but the one-day paralysis it
caused cost as much as $15 million in lost time and protective
work, according to prosecutors.

   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos is still
drawing mixed reviews from the education establishment 16 months
into his job, but his critics are showing signs of softening.
   ``We grade him somewhere in the `C' range. We changed it from a
`C-minus' because of his announcement'' of a report on the reading
and writing performance of American schoolchildren, said Jeanne
Allen, education policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, one of
his harshest critics.
   Cavazos, the former president of Texas Tech University who
became the first Hispanic Cabinet official in the waning days of
President Reagan's administration, has drawn fire in President
Bush's administration.
   Opponents call Cavazos a government outsider whose low-key
management style doesn't provide the vocal advocacy needed for
education. But White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
recently dismissed reports that Cavazos might be on his way out,
telling reporters, ``He has the job as long as he wants it.
Secretary Cavazos has done an outstanding job.''

for short-term interpreters of stock market action, the folks who
explain to you at the switch of a microphone why the market rose or
fell.
   There is plenty of resource material this week, as there always
is, and it will not matter that yesterday's reason for the market
falling might be put into service again to explain a subsequent
improvement.
   Negatively, losses at the Bank of New England are making that
industry look bad, the bankruptcy of Campeau Corp. might depress
retailing, the uprising in Baku might fuel speculation about
Mikhail Gorbachev's future.
   As usual, the negatives make up an endless list. Relatively new
to the list this week are renewed fears of rising interest rates, a
spread of pessimism from Tokyo stocks to New York, and maybe a
worsening of the budget deficit.
   Of use in explaining strength in the market would be any sign
whatever that the Federal Reserve might consider the White House
plea for lower borrowing rates, peace in the Soviet Union, or
evidence of a pickup in corporate profits.
   All these are underlying possibilities, but they are not really
immediate causes. Triggering them will be the usual statistical
confetti from government and industry.
   This week's list includes an announcement about the federal
deficit for December, the weekly money supply figures, and a really
big one, an estimate of fourth-quarter gross national product.
   In addition, there will be the mid-January report of automotive
sales, reports on new jobless claims and employment costs, and the
level of durable goods orders during December.
   In action, these triggers can be wonderfully imprecise. Some
lend themselves to ambiguity, and that makes them ideal for
ambidextrous analysts, the kind with a predisposition to the phrase
``on the other hand.''
   The same statistics can, and often have been, utilized by
different interpreters to support opposite conclusions. It is
entirely legal to use the same set of statistics negatively one day
and positively the next.
   Moreover, government statistics often can be employed more than
once, because the initial announcement often is revised. While
revisions seldom are of major consequence, they are there to serve
the interpreters, if necessary.
   Daily, in fact hourly, explanations are unusually complicated in
recent weeks by a dichotomy in the ranks of economists and
securities analysts. It is this: Is a strong economy good and a
weak one bad, or is it the reverse?
   Specifically, a gross national product gain of 3 percent to 6
percent on an annual basis usually would be welcomed, because it
would suggest economic strength and good corporate profits. But
this week it might be bad news for stocks.
   The explanation lies in the attitude of the Federal Reserve
Board, whose primary goal in the past year has been to restrain
inflation.
   Therefore, an unexpectedly large gain might suggest an economy
rising too fast, and provide sufficient reason to abandon any
immediate plans to let interest rates find a lower level.
   The fourth-quarter report to be announced this Friday isn't
likely to show any such gains; the consensus seems to suggest a
gain of less than 1 percent.
   It could be good for the securities markets _ or it could be
bad.

<HEAD>Quayle to Campaign for GOP Candidates in `Crucial Year for Me'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In off-year election campaigns, vice
presidents usually get a chance at leading roles. So Dan Quayle
expects to spend a good deal of his time on the road for
Republicans in ``a crucial year for me, a crucial year for the
party.''
   The vice president said he doesn't intend to be a GOP hatchet
man, ``but we will be prepared to launch an offensive strike if we
have to'' in the campaign for elections to choose a new House, 34
senators and 36 governors.
   Presidents tend to ration their own campaigning and turn to
their No. 2 men to carry the administration message and take on
party fundraising missions in congressional election years.
   ``I'll spend a good chunk of my time on the chicken and barbecue
circuit,'' Quayle said in an interview in his White House office.
   While Quayle said he expects to take on the traditional vice
presidential role, ``carrying a lot of the political
responsibilities,'' he added that President Bush may do more
off-year campaigning than some of his predecessors. ``This
president is very active, very politically astute, a former
national chairman,'' Quayle said.
   Bush also is very popular, riding higher in the public opinion
polls a year into his term than any president in nearly 30 years.
Quayle has had an image problem since he was nominated, and it
doesn't seem to be improving.
   But he already has Bush's public assurance of renomination for a
second term in 1992. ``Nobody took more heat and did a better job
for our ticket and our election,'' Bush said of Quayle at a
campaign reunion the other night.
   Off-year campaign duties can provide a vice president a platform
and an opportunity to boost his standing and his visibility. That
often is easier on the political circuit, away from Washington,
than in the strictly supporting role vice presidents have at home.
   ``It's a crucial year for me, a crucial year for the party, but
I've come to the conclusion that even though this will be a more
visible year for me in a political sense, I'm not so sure it's
going to be that much more of a visible year on a substantive
basis,'' said Quayle, who has blamed his continuing image problems
in large part on the critical drubbing he took during the 1988
campaign.
   ``The American people don't spend a lot of time thinking about
vice presidents,'' he said. ``They think about their president.
   ``And therefore, as far as the poll numbers and everything, you
inherit where you end up after a campaign and you can't do a whole
lot about it,'' he said. ``So you go about doing the job, and one
of the jobs I will have is political and raising money.''
   Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater credits Quayle with
raising more than $7 million for the party during his first year in
office. ``He's traveled to 38 states ... played a major role in
candidate recruitment,'' Atwater said. ``He understands the nuts
and bolts of politics.''
   Spencer Abraham, chairman of the Michigan Republican Party,
became Quayle's deputy chief of staff this month, with duties
including political liaison with party leaders.
   Quayle said one of his priorities will be the election of
Republican state legislators. He said that's vital if not as
visible as the statewide and House elections. The state governments
chosen this year will have control of the process of congressional
redistricting. ``The political jackpot is going to be who gets to
draw the lines come 1991,'' the vice president said.
   He said his message and tone as a campaigner will depend on the
political environment and the level of contention between the
Democratic Congress and the Republican White House. ``We will
certainly be prepared to launch an offensive strike against any
misguided or unfair criticism that happens to come the president's
way,'' he said. ``I have no role assigned to me to go out and be
the hatchet man or raise the partisan rhetoric to high decibels.''
But he said he will be ready to toughen the line if necessary.
   Bush was heavily engaged in the two off-year elections of his
vice presidency. The 1986 campaign provided a high-profile
assignment and an opportunity to collect some political IOUs for
use when he sought the Republican presidential nomination two years
later. In 1982, while the Republicans were on the way to losing 26
House seats in a recession year, Bush resisted White House pressure
to sharpen his attack. He said the ``colorful, hatchet man kind of
approach'' wasn't his style.
   ``I'm not Spiro Agnew,'' Bush said then.
   Agnew's 1970 campaign was the extravaganza of vice presidential
political missions: 51 days, 32,000 miles in a chartered jet,
denunciations of candidates he called ``radical liberals,''
alliterative attacks on ``nattering nabobs of negativism'' and
``pusillanimous pussyfooters.''
   One of his target states was Texas, to campaign for a Republican
Senate candidate who lost.
   George Bush.

<HEAD>Asian Communists Hold Rigidly on as European Europe Falls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HANOI, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As they watch East European communism
tumble out of orbit, leaders in Vietnam, North Korea and China are
defiantly holding to their old-line course toward the 21st century.
   They don't outwardly show concern that what is happening in
Eastern Europe will happen to them; for one thing, Asian communism
is rooted in still-revered nationalist heroes, such as China's Mao
Tse-tung and Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam.
   Nor do they agree that the upheaval in Eastern Europe resulted
from a failure of the communist system itself.
   ``It's not that the tree is no good, but the ones who planted
the tree are no good,'' as Maj. Gen. Trang Cong Man, permanent vice
secretary-general of the Vietnam Journalists Association, explained
it.
   Unlike Eastern Europe's version, Asian communism finds strength
in traditional Confucianism, which emphasizes respect for authority.
   At the same time, Asian communists face no organized opposition
comparable to Poland's Solidarity labor movement that could form a
rallying point for dissent.
   Thus, even in the face of Eastern Europe's sweeping changes,
Asia's communist nations are vigorously defending their one-party
rule.
   China's Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, said at year end the
leadership of the party is a ``historical necessity. ... Without
centralism we will have extreme democracy and anarchy, and nothing
can be accomplished.''
   Highly regimented North Korea, which is largely closed off to
the non-communist world, is reported to have recalled some of its
students from Eastern Europe, presumably so they would not witness
the changes that Pyongyang considers political heresy.
   Kim Jong Il, son of long-time leader Kim Il Sung and heir
apparent, said the North Korean Communist Party ``must on no
account admit hetergeneous ideas into it. In party activity, the
unity of action based on a single ideology can be realized through
monolithic leadership.''
   Even tiny Laos, which has been led by communists since the
Indochina War, had something to say. Its official radio opened the
new year with a broadcast acknowledging that 1989 was ``a
nightmare'' for communism and calling on the people to rally around
the party.
   No Asian country has been more vocal than Vietnam in defense of
communism.
   Nguyen Van Linh, the Vietnamese party chief, said in his New
Year's message that building socialism would be a goal for Vietnam
in 1990. Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said the communism system
would emerge reinvigorated after overcoming the crisis it faces in
Eastern Europe.
   Still, the Asian nations clearly are troubled by the
implications of the European revolution and are drawing lessons.
   ``We follow these events in Europe so we can distinguish what is
good and what is bad,'' said Trang Cong Man of the journalists
association. The sweeping changes show, for example, that Eastern
Europeans wanted more democracy and higher production levels, he
said.
   Hanoi already realizes that if communism is to survive it needs
a dose of market-oriented reform to stimulate the economy.
   After a decade of disastrous economic policies, Vietnam in 1986
introduced reforms such as deregulating prices, permitting private
enterprise and vastly curtailing subsidies to state enterprises.
   Although Vietnam remains one of the world's poorest nations,
substantial gains in food production and in fighting inflation were
made last year and consumerism is on the rise.
   Many Hanoi stores already are stocked with the foreign color
televisions and video cassette recorders favored by Vietnamese.
   In many ways, the economic program is similar to that instituted
in China in the early 1980s by Deng Xiaoping, the senior leader.
   Deng refused to open up the political system, however, leading
to widespread protests for democracy that eventually led to the
bloody crackdown on dissent and the resurgence of aging,
conservative leaders who are turning back on economic reform.
   Hanoi also has opted to proceed with political change at a much
slower pace than economic reform.
   The Vietnamese Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan said in
November the party ``does not accept opposition political parties
in a socialist society _ the main feature of political pluralism
has been rejected by our party.''
   Exhausted from decades of fighting foreign armies, the
Vietnamese don't seem to hold a multiparty system as one of their
immediate aims.
   ``What the people like most is peace and security, and doing
business and developing the economy, that is the first and foremost
demand of the Vietnamese people,'' said Nguyen Dinh Thi, a writer
and a party member for 40 years.
   However, he indicated that while people are not necessarily
interested now in a multiparty system they do want more openness
from the leadership.
   ``This party must accept pluralism of opinions,'' he said in an
interview. ``I think we should have many social organizations, but
it is not necessary to have many parties.''
   In private conversations, however, Vietnamese encountered by a
visiting reporter indicated approval of what has happened in
Eastern Europe.
   ``Yes, I know what has happened in Eastern Europe,'' said a
store clerk, in a typical reaction. ``It is good, and it will be
good for Vietnam, too.''

<BYLINE>ABC Airs a Guns Special, CBS a Paul McCartney Tour
^By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With no major ratings wars afoot in January, ABC
and CBS each have news specials this week. ABC's ``Guns'' tonight
is a serious venture, while Thursday's ``48 Hours'' on CBS takes a
look at Paul McCartney on tour.
   Neither is all that special. ABC's effort is a moderate,
even-handed report from Stockton, Calif., where a suicidal madman
with an AK-47 killed five schoolchildren and wounded 30 others just
over a year ago.
   But in its broad look at the gun issue, it doesn't delve very
deeply into the matter of such military weapons as the AK-47 or
M-16, or that their bullet magazines can hold 20 or more rounds, or
who would want to own one and why.
   Still, ``Guns,'' is unique in two respects. It's the first of a
series of prime time specials that ABC will air under the title
``Peter Jennings Reporting.'' In the age of the vanishing
single-subject documentary, it's good to see someone _ ABC News
President Roone Arledge in this case _ attempting a modest comeback
in the arena.
   Secondly, ``Guns,'' followed tonight by a 90-minute
``Nightline'' forum on the subject, is a collaboration of sorts by
ABC with Time magazine, which features the National Rifle
Association on this week's cover.
   Such a print-network link isn't new. CBS and Newsweek magazine
had a similar effort in 1981. Newsweek ran a cover story on the
surviving members of an Army rifle company who had fought in
Vietnam, and CBS reunited 31 of them for a Bill Moyers special,
``Bittersweet Memories: A Vietnam Reunion.''
   The ABC-Time venture differs in that each organization, while
simultaneously reporting on the gun controversy, takes a different
approach on the subject, covering it ``in our own way,'' a Time
executive says.
   Richard Duncan, Time's assistant managing editor, says he thinks
the word ``synergy'' is terrible, but that it describes the idea
here.
   With both news organizations simultaneously reporting on guns,
he says, ``maybe you get a little more attention for the subject.
Certain people are likely to read the magazine, or see it on ABC,
or both.''
   Time and ABC, he says, have discussed trying the approach
perhaps three or four times a year, but doing ``no more than that.
And it would be remarkable, given the way (breaking) news goes, if
we actually ended up doing that.''
   It's not a long-term arrangement, he adds. ``This is all very
informal. This is testing, see how it feels, how it looks, how it
works.''
   It can be debated whether CBS News _ which earlier did separate
specials on guns and assault rifles _ need have devoted 90 minutes
to Thursday's special, ``48 Hours On Tour With Paul McCartney.''
   Surveying McCartney on the Chicago stop of his first North
American tour in 13 years, it has interviews with the former
Beatle, his production troops, a McCartney-crazed fan and
plainclothes cops seeking ticket scalpers.
   Some of it is interesting, and in one case hilarious _ the
arrest of a professional ticket scalper who grouses that the
McCartney crowd ``is just too damn old'' and makes it hard for him
to detect plainclothes cops.
   It does amply re-establish that rock is very big business as
well as a form of music. And that such British lords of rock as
McCartney are durable indeed, even though they and their fans are
now fortysomething.
   But the special, in which McCartney comes across as a
good-natured gent with a sense of proportion about fame and life
its ownself, adds little to what has been written about him and the
Beatles over the years.
   It might have been more interesting had it explored his musical
tastes, keeping in mind that McCartney _ who has written some fine,
lovely songs _ and many older British pop stars know far more of
music than rock. Some even speak jazz or classical, and know of the
older pop standards.
   After seeing CBS' special, you tend to wish it had skipped the
McCartney-mad fan, who rapidly proves a pain, and instead followed
up on the star's remark about the early days.
   Back then, he says, ``we were really keen to emulate the
songwriters that we loved. I mean, I was out to become like another
Cole Porter. Still am, babe.''

   Elsewhere in television...
   MORNING SHOWS SEEK WARMTH: Both ABC's ``Good Morning America''
and ``CBS This Morning'' are escaping the chill of New York next
month for the warmth of Florida. CBS' program will be there the
week of Feb. 12, followed the next week by ABC's reveille patrol.
NBC says its ``Today'' show will probably will brave it out here.

   ``See You in the Morning'' (Warner Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95.
PG-13)
   
   ``See You in the Morning'' takes a generally cheerful _ and
occasionally sappy _ look at the confusion and pain, as well as the
joy, of love and marriage the second time around.
   Divorced New York psychiatrist Larry Livingstone (Jeff Bridges)
falls in love with and marries Beth (Alice Krige), a widow having a
hard time letting go of her husband, a suicide victim.
   While Beth tries to take blame for every foible of family life,
Larry can be a pain in the neck in his own style, annoyingly
insecure and self-deprecating. As even he says, he's nice only
during office hours.
   But both are essentially good and do their best to negotiate the
problems that ``musical families'' create for her two children and
his two, who live with their television model mom (Farrah Fawcett).
   Director Alan J. Pakula falls far short of his best efforts
(``All the President's Men,'' ``Klute'' and ``Sophie's Choice''),
but presents a pleasant film with some funny and touching moments.
The latter include a lovely wedding reception scene in which their
somewhat tipsy friend (Linda Lavin) gets the assembled to sing
``Auld Lang Syne.''
   The characters of this film have no financial problems, they are
intelligent and talented, and they have friends. So it's sometimes
easy to lose patience with their problems, which can seem a little
precious.
   Bridges and Krige are very good, as are all four children.
Frances Sternhagen is memorable as Larry's wise and loving first
mother-in-law.

   ``March'' (RCA) _ Michael Penn
   
   Yes, Michael Penn is you-know-who's younger brother, and critics
looking for an easy hook are quick to note his music is as sweet as
Sean's temper is frequently sour.
   Despite the connection, there's no evidence of nepotism here.
Penn's debut album is a pleasing slice of pure pop and if he errs,
it's only on the side of boyish enthusiasm.
   ``No Myth,'' the first single and the album's lead cut, sets an
immediate light-hearted tone. Penn sings Beatlesque melodies in a
slightly ragged tenor, centering most songs around his acoustic
guitar and building from there.
   What takes the songs out of the ``Rubber Soul'' era are pounding
drums emphasized in the mix, a reflection of the current scene's
preoccupation with the beat. Drum machines handle part of the load,
but Jim Keltner's outstanding performance on ``Brave New World''
shows how the real thing can never be completely duplicated.
   Penn collaborates with keyboardist Patrick Warren on most of the
music. Although there's an occasional dud, Penn hits more often
than he misses. ``This and That'' and ``Bedlam Boys'' are the
strongest after ``No Myth,'' and ``Evenfall'' brings the album to a
rollicking close.
   Penn tries hard lyrically, and his Dylan-like wordplay on
``Brave New World'' works well. Sometimes he tries too hard, as
this couplet from the turgid ``Cupid's Got a Brand New Gun''
attests: ``It glitters like a viper, readies its attack, tears your
flesh and soul apart, then clings to your back.''
   ``March'' also sounds a tad overproduced. Bragging you've got
studio pros like Keltner and Kenny Aronoff dueting on drums may pad
an industry reputation, but their work doesn't mean anything if the
song isn't there. The songs are there, but sometimes too much
window-dressing is added.
   If he can retain his ability to write catchy melodies and hack
some of the unnecessary verbiage from his writing, Penn has a
promising future.

   ``All the Way'' (Solar-Epic) _ Calloway
   
   The proper way to listen to Calloway's first album is with your
feet.
   Dance floor stompers and toe-to-toe swayers mix together on
``All the Way.''
   This record is funky and soulful, but it's Funky Soulful Lite.
Nothing hits too hard. There's a bit of rapping, but Public Enemy
it ain't. It's thrown in as a little sample of contemporary sound.
   ``Sir Lancelot,'' the album's opener, is the groove-i-est cut.
It and ``All the Way,'' the hardest-hitting track, are dance
rave-ups. They won't burn down the house like a Bobby Brown or
Janet Jackson cut, but they're warm enough.
   The duo's ballads slide along cozily, without getting too deep
or urgent.
   On the first single, Calloway sings ``I Wanna Be Rich,'' but
unlike the 9-million-pounds-of-gold-necklaces bad attitude of some
rappers, Calloway sings to be rich in ``love, peace and happiness.''
   The energy level on ``All the Way'' jumps up and down like a
confused thermometer.
   Both sides start with pumped-up tunes, but then flatten out into
ballads.
   Another dance track, ``Freaks Compete,'' pops up between ballads
on the first side.
   ``All the Way'' is brothers Reggie and Cino-vincent Calloway's
debut effort as Calloway. Their recording history includes seven
years, one platinum album and two gold albums with the dance-soul
group Midnight Star, and writing and production credits for several
other artists, including Levert (the dance floor smash
``Casanova''), Gladys Knight and the Pips (the Grammy-winning
``Love Overboard''), Natalie Cole (``Jump Start My Heart'') and
Teddy Pendergrass (``Joy'').

<HEAD>Music Makers: Denny Laine Hopes to Earn His Wings in America</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GERMAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOCKPORT, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Denny Laine has traveled a long and
stymied road from Scotland's Mull of Kintyre to Lock No. 11 on the
Erie Canal.
   His nine-year odyssey into obscurity since leaving Paul
McCartney's post-Beatles band, Wings, reached a new low when his
boat ran out of gas on the canal last November, and fuel was
nowhere to be found.
   After an aborted boat trip to Florida, Laine and a friend found
themselves stranded in Amsterdam, 30 miles west of Albany. They
eventually found fuel, but the experience gave Laine a few moments
to wonder if the New World offered anything better than the old to
revive his career.
   ``I've always wanted to come here to work,'' said Laine, who
left England last fall to live in another friend's canal-side
mansion in Lockport, 25 miles north of Buffalo. ``I felt this was
where I needed to be to get started. I'm in a begin-again
situation. ... Over here I've got a nostalgia name and people will
probably turn out to see what I can do.''
   After Wings scored with Britain's biggest selling single ever,
``Mull of Kintyre,'' Laine's downward spiral began when he and
McCartney parted company. Critics characterized their split as a
minor version of the McCartney-John Lennon rift that broke up the
Beatles.
   ``There's no real animosity, anymore. ... Me and Paul had a good
team and we still are a good team,'' said Laine, founder of the
Moody Blues and the only member of the original Wings trio whose
last name wasn't McCartney. ``When Lennon died, Paul said he was
never going to let that happen again, he was never going to fall
out with anyone again.''
   In England, Laine left behind a messy divorce, an ugly tax
record and the remnants of a career that always kept him on the
fringes of superstardom.
   At 45, he is struggling to escape the shadow of the aging rock
star with little left to say. He's thought of doing an
autobiography, but he's not sure it would be popular. ``Who am I,
really?'' Laine said.
   With the Moody Blues in the 1960s, Laine was as much a star as
Eric Clapton with Cream or Steve Winwood with Traffic. But his solo
efforts in the '70s and '80s never lifted him above his early work
with the Moodys or his backseat efforts for Wings.
   Such Laine tunes as ``Time to Hide'' did offer a harder-rocking
edge to McCartney's pure pop formula, which produced an assembly
line of hits that included ``My Love'' and ``Let 'Em In.''
   Since leaving Wings in 1981, Laine has put out four obscure solo
albums. As a wandering ex-minstrel, he spent much of his time in
Spain. He learned to travel light, partly by choice and partly
because divorce and taxes claimed so many of his possessions.
   ``I don't really own anything,'' Laine said. ``It makes me more
fluent _ er, fluid. More fluent, too, because I've learned a lot of
languages by traveling around.''
   Laine plans to travel the United States, playing small clubs and
writing material for a new album.
   His first project will be a song called ``Food for All,'' a ``We
Are the World''-style collaboration to raise money for the
homeless. He said he wants to get all his friends from the early
days involved, including McCartney, Clapton and Ron Wood of the
Rolling Stones.
   Laine wrote the music, while his friend Geoffrey Giuliano of
Lockport _ who has written three books on the Beatles _ wrote the
lyrics. Laine, who is now staying with friends in Boston, lived
with Giuliano for about two months last fall.
   Giuliano said Laine's one real talent is ``to make good music.''
But wrong choices have marked his career, and Laine tended to get
suckered into bad business schemes, Giuliano said. Laine admits he
put money where he shouldn't have _ backing a race car driver and a
record shop when he should have been concentrating on his music.
   He has been on his own since breaking with McCartney, although
he did play on McCartney's 1982 album, ``Tug of War.'' After 10
years with Wings, he was tired of being the band's lead guitar but
second fiddle _ or perhaps third fiddle, behind McCartney and his
wife, Linda.
   ``I know people who were a hell of a lot more bitter than I
was,'' Laine said. ``I wasn't bitter so much as sick of it all.
I've retreated to what I was originally, which is an individual
songwriter.''
   The driving force on the Moody Blues' first two albums, Laine
had trouble being the nameless face alongside the McCartneys on
Wings album covers.
   He insists he and McCartney had a true partnership. Yet others
associated with Wings made him feel like McCartney's flunky, a
junior partner on the order of George Harrison, whom McCartney and
Lennon granted a token pair of songs on most Beatles albums, Laine
said.
   ``Other people made me feel like I was working for him instead
of working with him,'' Laine said. ``That was one of the reasons I
did walk away from it.''
   Another reason was McCartney's 1980 marijuana arrest in Japan.
That and death threats McCartney received after Lennon was killed
kept the band from touring.
   ``We would have been going back into the studio for two more
years,'' Laine said. ``I was bored with it.''
   Laine also said he had wanted Wings to turn ``toward more funky,
dancey stuff.'' Since Laine left, McCartney has done just that,
recording with Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Elvis Costello.
   Similarly, Laine said he left the Moody Blues in 1967 because
the other band members seemed unwilling to hit the studio and
record the splashy concept album he wanted to do.
   A few months later, Laine was with Lennon when the Moodys
brought over a tape of their new album. ``Days of Future Passed''
was the band's biggest success, a rock-classical fusion that
yielded ``Nights in White Satin'' and ``Tuesday Afternoon.''
   ``As a result of my leaving, they did exactly what I wanted to
do,'' Laine said. ``But they wouldn't have done it if I had stayed.
I contributed my part and moved on.''
   His anthem could be the early hit he sang for the Moody Blues,
``Go Now.'' When real stardom neared, Laine went.
   ``Maybe I was scared of it or something,'' he said. ``If it
doesn't feel right, I don't stay around very long.''
   Laine plans to marry his long-time girlfriend Helen Grant,
daughter of Led Zeppelin manager Peter Grant. They'll stay in the
United States for a year or two so Laine can tour and record,
eventually dividing their time between the United States and
England, he said.
   ``It's my turn to put something together. I can't wait around
any longer for someone to approach me,'' Laine said. ``I feel like
I've been saving myself up for the last few years.''

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Methodist minister who was
forced to leave the pulpit after a celebrated church trial arising
from her practice of homosexuality has written an autobiography
that concludes with an appeal for tolerance and acceptance.
   ``Let My People In'' (William Morrow and Co., $18.95) traces
Rose Mary Denman's journey from her strict Roman Catholic childhood
in a blue-collar Rhode Island family to her discovery of her
lesbian identity that culminated in her relationship with the woman
with whom she lives in Portland.
   Along the way, there was service in the Air Force, marriage,
motherhood, divorce seminary studies and yet another change in
religious allegiance _ to the Unitarian Universalist Association.
   If nothing else, Denman, 42, said she hopes the book will
encourage readers to be more understanding and less judgmental of
people whose sexual preferences differ from their own.
   ``Before anyone begins to judge, they should think how many
people out there are gay,'' she said in an interview. ``You could
be judging your own child, your minister, or any number of other
people.''
   Estranged from her father and an outcast in her family after she
defied her bishop and refused to keep her lesbianism a secret,
Denman counsels family members to try to avoid laying blame or
guilt.
   ``If we could only begin to see that homosexuality is simply
another alternative to loving, perhaps we can stop trying to find a
person or an event to blame,'' she wrote. ``Homosexuality is not a
disease to be cured or a sin to be healed. It is a life to be lived
and celebrated, no less than heterosexuality.''
   The book is dedicated to Winnie Weir, the ex-wife of a Methodist
minister who Denman met while she served as pastor of a small
church in North Anson. Their friendship evolved into love, leading
to the break between Denman and the United Methodist Church.
   Prior to that time, Denman said, she was unaware of her sexual
orientation, although in retrospect there were indications she was
gay: her crush on a kindergarten teacher or her sorrow at being
separated from her Air Force training instructor.
   ``Looking back, it was like it was all there but I was too blind
to see it. I had a bad case of denial,'' she said.
   The book also details Denman's 1987 church trial in Dover, N.H.,
where a jury of Methodist ministers found her guilty of violating a
3-year-old church rule banning homosexual clergy. She could have
been expelled from the church or removed from the clergy, but was
given the lesser penalty of suspension, which allowed her time to
transfer to another denomination.
   Four months later, she was accepted into the Unitarian ministry,
where she fills in for other pastors and takes on various speaking
engagements. While she initially hoped to obtain her own parish,
she said she no longer aspires to the full-time ministry.
   ``Parish ministry means living in a fish bowl, and I don't like
living a fish-bowl life style,'' she said. ``Somebody started the
rumor that ministers are supposed to be perfect, and 99 percent of
us are not.''
   The public demands that a minister be always patient, never
tired, ever the perfect listener, she added. ``I have to be more
human than that.''
   Instead, she has found a fulfilling new career in teaching and
now works as a part-time instructor in English and psychology at
Southern Maine Technical College in South Portland.
   Denman says her book has a potentially broad audience.
   ``The United Methodists are going to buy the book because
they're nosy; other gays and lesbians will buy it because it's our
story, our struggle; and others will buy it because they want to
find out more about the issue of homosexuality and how the church
relates to it.''
   Denman says that while she had initially felt pain, then anger
and finally disillusionment after her split with the Methodist
church, she harbors no grudges or feelings of bitterness.
   ``They unwittingly gave me more opportunity for growth than I've
ever had before,'' she said.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Amy Grant Sings From Convictions</HEAD>

   Amy Grant makes no apologies for her
brand of pop-gospel music. And in turn she doesn't criticize other,
more controversial singers.
   ``As musicians, we at the end of the day have to answer for what
we've done. That's true of everybody in life. Some handle that
responsibility very poorly. At times I do, too,'' says Grant,
winner of four Grammy awards.
   She hopes her songs about the joy of living, spiritual responses
and her own failures and weaknesses are a positive alternative to
other forms of music and entertainers who often greatly influence
youngsters.
   ``Some kids try on different personalities and different
expressions of behavior in life and the pendulum swings too far and
they never come back,'' she said. ``It's horrible and tragic.''
   Uncontroversial and unfailingly pleasant, the 29-year-old singer
has emerged from the gospel music field as a force in pop music
with her million-selling albums ``Unguarded,'' ``Age to Age'' and,
most recently, ``A Christmas Album.''
   She joined Peter Cetera, former lead singer for Chicago, on a
No. 1 pop record in 1986, ``Next Time I Fall.''
   They have not recorded together since, Grant said, because she
started a family. She and her husband, singer-songwriter Gary
Chapman, have a son, Matthew, 2, and a daughter, Gloria, born in
December.
   ``And the right song hasn't come along,'' she said.
   The No. 1 record, she said, raised her already blossoming career
another peg or two. ``Everybody dreams of that kind of visibility.''
   Grant describes ``Next Time I Fall'' as ``a sweet song and
beautifully produced. Peter's voice is legendary. People hear it
and think of everything from `Saturday in the Park' to `You're My
Inspiration.' It's hard to lose when you're doing a song with
someone who's that much of a heavyweight.''
   She's also featured in a duet with Art Garfunkel on his ``The
Animals' Christmas,'' a delightful album of Jimmy Webb songs that
came out in 1986.
   Grant's career aim is to inspire and not to preach, and the
messages in her music are sometimes veiled. But she says the
reaction from the public has been a meaningful part of her life.
   ``Over the last 10 years, I have received more letters ... and
just one in a lifetime would make a life worthwhile,'' she said in
an interview at her secluded farm 30 minutes south of downtown
Nashville.
   ``One response was from a kid saying, `You helped me survive a
night that I didn't think I would live through.' That's enough
appreciation to make you believe your whole career has been
worthwhile.''
   Grant was born in Augusta, Ga., and raised in Nashville, where
her father, a doctor, moved to set up practice. The youngest of
four daughters, she grew up listening to Carole King and James
Taylor as her interest in Bible studies and a love of singing drew
her toward gospel music.
   She was working in a recording studio sweeping floors at age 15
when a record producer heard a tape of her singing and signed her
to a contract. She felt the demands of the business at a young age,
having to give up her English studies at Vanderbilt University
after three years because of the need to travel and record.
   In the years since, Grant has become one of Nashville's biggest
singing stars in a city dominated by more earthy country music.
   She has released 11 albums and had hit single records such as
``Angels,'' ``Find a Way'' and ``El Shaddai.''
   She has appeared on such diverse TV shows as ``The Tonight Show
Starring Johnny Carson,'' ``Hee Haw'' and ``700 Club.''
   As a humanitarian, she has been active in Habitat for Humanity,
an organization that helps build homes for low-income families. In
Rochester, N.Y., and Birmingham, Ala., she pitched in at
construction sites by grabbing hammers and saws. She spoke in
support of the group during a 58-city concert tour in 1988.
   Grant points to her songs, her voice and stage manner as keys to
her popularity. ``I think my songs are easy to relate to. I think
my voice is easy to relate to. I think there's something familiar
about what I do because I sing from life experiences.
   ``I've been told that in concert I have a gift of putting people
at ease, making an audience feel included in the experience and not
watching from afar,'' she said.
   ``I think it's because I like to be included in things. It's
sort of a natural progression for me to put on a concert like
that.''

finger-popping hits.
   Everywhere except Japan.
   The Stones will take their ``Steel Wheels'' tour to Japan for
nine SRO performances at the 45,000-seat Tokyo Dome in
mid-February. The 405,000 tickets sold out the second day of
purchase, becoming the largest sell-out ever of consecutive shows
there.
   The Stones are expected to perform a 2{-hour set of their

<HEAD>Age-Group Competition Soars Among Older Athletes</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to CORRECT that Nicklaus' birthday Sunday sted
Monday</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SHEILA NORMAN-CULP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jack Nicklaus can scorch the fairways like
practically no one else, but this month he became just another
statistic in a growing trend.
   Nicklaus, who turned 50 on Sunday, is now eligible to join the
PGA Seniors tour. He's also joining _ albeit with not quite as much
fanfare _ the exploding number of older Americans who compete in
age-group sports.
   The attraction is simple: try your hardest, be your best, and in
five to 10 years be reborn into an older group. Masters swimmers,
for example, compete in five-year intervals up to 90-94. The United
States Tennis Federation sanctions matches for men 85 and older and
women 75 and older. Age-group competitions also are organized in
bicycling, track and field, marathons and triathlons.
   The system encourages older Americans to keep competing, because
at least once every few years they get to be the youngest kid on
the block.
   ``You like to come in at the bottom of your age group and blow
them away,'' said Dr. George McVey, 62, of Rochester, N.Y., who has
competed for 17 years in masters swimming and has been
internationally ranked in the breaststroke.
   ``It's amazing _ the condition of these people,'' he said of
those attending national masters swim meets.
``Seventy-five-year-olds can go up and down the pool like you
wouldn't believe.''
   ``A couple of years ago, our oldest category was 50-plus,'' said
Gary Scott of Triathlon Federation@USA. ``Now it's 70-plus.''
   These older triathletes aren't running mini-events, either. They
are in the same grueling races attempted by athletes 50 years their
junior.
   ``We had one 64-year-old woman who finished in a decent time at
the Ironman,'' Scott said. ``She beat a lot of men in their
thirties.''
   The Ironman is one of the world's most prestigious triathlons,
held in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, each year. The woman, Joanita Reed of
San Antonio, swam a 2.4-mile ocean race, cycled 112 miles over
hills and ran a 26.2-mile marathon, all in the same day. She
finished in 14 hours, 31 minutes and 55 seconds.
   ``We have experienced a dramatic increase in masters riders in
the last five years,'' agreed Kyle Woodlief, spokesman for the
United States Cycling Federation in Colorado Springs, Colo. ``Our
oldest licensed racer is 93.''
   That rider, Fred Knoller of Lauderdale-By-The-Sea, Fla.,
competed in the U.S. Nationals from 1976 to 1985, when he was 89.
Knoller has stopped competing but is still a big fan of the move
toward smaller age-group categories.
   ``When I was in my 50's, I was still racing against
40-year-olds,'' he said. He keeps his membership to get the
newsletter and find out how friends are doing. ``Some of these boys
60, 65, are really good. Real pros.''
   Last June, the cream of American senior athletes gathered to go
for the gold in St. Louis, at the U.S. National Senior Olympics.
The 3,452 athletes, ranging from 55 to 91, earned the chance to
compete through strong performances at qualifying meets, where more
than 100,000 seniors tested their mettle.
   ``You know the saying, `If you don't use it, you lose it,'' said
Sylvia Auerbach Swartz, 77, who with her sisters Rose, 74, and
Pearl, 68, earned 12 medals at the Senior Olympics. ``It's
important not to let the joints get stiff. You've got to keep them
going.''
   Swartz, of New York, said a youthful diet of volleyball,
softball, basketball, lacrosse and speedball, along with some
middle-aged tennis and ping-pong laid the base for her success.
Medals in field events came from weekly training, pointers from
local coaches, and encouragement from her sisters.
   ``We don't compete against each other, though,'' she said.
``That's why we are still talking.''
   At the VIII World Veterans Championships last summer in Eugene,
Ore. _ billed as the largest track meet in history, former Olympic
athletes faced top-flight but unknown competitors from around the
world. Many of the 4,950 athletes produced times and distances that
were the talk of the meet.
   Paula Schneiderhan of West Germany produced a world record in
the womens' 65-69 200-meter sprint with a time of 31.65 seconds.
   Although seniors are still a rather small segment of the sports
population, one industry expert says when they do enjoy a sport,
they go at it with gusto.
   ``The mature market incidence in most sports is pretty low,''
said Harvey Lauer, president of American Sports Data Inc., a
research firm in Hartsdale.
   ``But if you look at the people who do run, for example, and are
over 55, they do it with a vengeance,'' he said. ``Tennis players
over 55 play tennis more than tennis players in general. It's a
time factor.''
   Although some age-group seniors were top athletes in their prime
_ like Rose Auerbach, national AAU javelin champ in 1937 and 1938 _
many more found the joy of competition much later in life. The
80-to-84 category, for example, is the fastest-growing age group at
U.S. Masters Swimming meets.
   Dan Gruender, the president of U.S. Masters Swimming, began
competing only after following his wife, Edie, to Masters swim
meets. At 61, Mrs. Gruender is internationally ranked in the
butterfly, freestyle and individual medley.
   ``As the greying of America takes place, people realize that
staying active is the one way to improve the quality of your life.
It's also very satisfying. And that's what it's all about,'' he
said. ``Self-improvement is the touchstone we push. We don't care
if it takes you 3 minutes to swim a lap. Next time make it 2:59.''

   Asked at her retirement luncheon what she
was going to do with all the time she'd have, Pearl Peters said she
and her husband planned to visit their grown children. And she'd
paint, visit friends, maybe volunteer at the local hospital. She'd
also spend more time with her parents.
   But when planning her retirement, Mrs. Peters underestimated the
amount of time and energy it would take to care for her parents.
How could she help them remain healthy, active and independent for
as long as possible?
   Mrs. Peters and others like her can succeed by starting to think
about the special needs of aging parents long before a crisis so
parents are included in the process. Every situation is different,
but most families should consider health care, social support,
housing, and legal and financial issues.
   Health strongly influences a person's sense of well-being. While
most older people are basically healthy and consider themselves to
be, many tend to under-report specific problems and mistakenly
think they are caused by age. Research has shown that physical and
mental decline are not inevitable, and that aches and pains may be
warnings of disease. They should be discussed with a doctor,
preferably a specialist in the health problems of aging.
   Those who don't have a family doctor can contact a county
medical society or state or local agency on aging. Other sources of
information include local referral services, health departments,
medical schools and medical centers.
   Caregiving adult children can help their parents stay healthy
and active by encouraging them to have regular checkups, exercise
and eat properly.
   Most older people _ even those with an illness or disability _
can take part in moderate exercise programs. Before starting a
fitness program, however, older adults should see their doctor.
   The basic guidelines for a nutritious diet are the same for most
healthy adults. Older people, however, need to pay special
attention to the quality of foods; a balanced diet provides
vitamins, minerals and calories from proteins, carbohydrates and
some fats and includes foods from each major group.
   Now that more women (the traditional caregivers) are working, a
greater need for a wide network of supportive services is emerging.
If additional help is needed, a physician, nurse and social worker
trained in geriatrics can be asked for a comprehensive geriatric
assessment, thorough diagnosis, appropriate treatment options and
help in identifying supportive services. An assessment will also
identify medical and rehabilitation possibilities that may minimize
the need for supportive services.
   In assessing housing needs, families should look at the safety
and convenience of appliances, furnishings and the layout of the
house. Improved lighting and adjustments such as widening doors to
accommodate wheelchairs or installing handrails on steps and in
bathrooms are relatively simple and will permit older people to
remain in their own homes longer.
   A growing number of housing alternatives are available when an
older person can no longer live alone. Choices depend on factors
including health, financial resources and family situation. Options
include retirement communities, senior citizen housing, accessory
apartments and shared housing. Adult children and their parents can
consider sharing the same house, but this often is not whaat either
generation really prefers. Nursing homes are, and should be, only
for those who really need them. The decision to enter a nursing
home should be made by both the person entering the home and the
family.
   The question of finances cannot be avoided. Medical and
long-term care are expensive and can quickly deplete a family's
savings. One thing everyone can do to prepare for the future is to
get records in order. A financial records file should include such
things as a person's social security number, date and place of
birth, location of a will or trust, sources of income and bank
accounts.
   Caregiving for an older parent often involves a partnership of
family, friends, support services, and medical and legal
professionals. While devoting time and energy, caregivers also must
be sure to attend to their own interests and health. It is
important to recognize limitations, to think creatively, to ask for
help if needed, and to maintain a sense of humor.

   Chrysler Corp. plans to form a joint venture with
an Austrian company to make a European version of the automakers'
popular minivans beginning next year.
   The move, announced Monday, is further recognition by Chrysler
of the growing importance of the European market. Trade barriers
among the 12 nations belonging to the European Economic Community
fall in 1992, and will create a vehicle market larger than North
America.
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have had European
manufacturing plants for years. Chrysler sold its European
operations to Peugeot of France in 1978 as its financial crisis
worsened, but in recent years it has been exporting some cars and
minivans to Europe under the Chrysler nameplate, along with its
Jeep brand sport-utility vehicles.

   General Motors Corp. intends to recall 244,000
four-cylinder Pontiac Fieros _ every one ever made _ because of a
nagging engine-fire problem that contributed to the company's
decision to scuttle the two-seater.
   The plastic-body, mid-engine Fiero was introduced as a 1984
model in September 1983 and was an immediate sales success. But its
demise at the end of the 1988 model year came nearly as quickly,
after consumer advocate Ralph Nader alleged engine problems led to
fires.
   GM said Monday it hasn't determined when the recall will take
effect or what kind of repair work will be performed.

<HEAD>U.S. Camera Maker Sues Mitsubishi over Export, Parts Allegations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. camera company has answered a lawsuit
by the trading arm of Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi with legal
papers of its own in a dispute over parts supply and overseas
marketing agreements.
   Keystone Camera of Clifton said Monday it sued Mitsubishi
International Corp. in federal court here seeking more than $30
million.
   Keystone accused Mitsubishi of acting in bad faith, with plans
to either take over Keystone or ``drive it out of business'' by
wrongly charging it $1.9 million for parts and refusing to market
Keystone cameras overseas.
   The suit, filed Friday, seeks what it said were $21.75 million
in lost profits and $10 million in punitive damages.
   Mitsubishi sued Keystone in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
last December, accusing it of failing to pay the $1.9 million and
of violating an agreement under which Mitsubishi would be its
exclusive importer.
   Keystone's suit ``has a very strong element of fantasy,'' said
Mitsubishi's attorney, Marshall Beil.
   The Japanese company has ``bent over backwards to help Keystone
work out payment terms,'' he said. It is in Mitsubishi's interest
that Keystone remain healthy, he added.
   Keystone said Mitsubishi failed to live up to arrangements
reached in Sept. 1988, under which the Japanese concern would
supply it with electronic parts in exchange for $3 million in
completed cameras.
   The agreements also called for Mitsubishi to sell Keystone
cameras in all foreign markets except for England, said Keystone
Chairman Mike Berman.
   ``It was an extremely unusual agreement,'' Berman acknowledged,
and was made by previous management.
   The lawsuit said Mitsubishi continued to send Keystone parts
beyond the $3 million, which weren't needed because Mitsubishi had
failed to generate enough business overseas for the finished
cameras.
   When Keystone balked at paying the $1.9 million for the extra
parts, Mitsubishi allegedly cut off parts shipments and told its
offices to stop selling Keystone cameras.
   Mitsubishi was motivated in part because the parent company has
a financial interest in Nikon Corp., a major manufacturer and
distributor of camera equipment, said the lawsuit.
   ``All the parts that Mitsubishi shipped were specifically
ordered and specifically requested by Keystone,'' said Beil,
denying that the Nikon interest influenced its actions. Nor did
Mitsubishi ever refuse to market Keystone cameras, he said.
   Keystone, which predicts $42 million in 1989 sales, said it and
Polaroid are the only U.S. manufacturers of cameras. After a $1.9
million loss in the first quarter, Keystone reported earnings of
$521,000 for the third quarter.
   It has 800 employees at its headquarters and plant in Clifton.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Will Help Customers Access Other Carriers If Outage Hits
Again</HEAD>

   Access codes for rival telephone companies
will be provided by AT&amp;T operators if another serious outage
cripples its own long-distance service, the company announced.
   After a Jan. 15 breakdown that affected American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. customers nationwide, the country's largest
long-distance carrier was criticized because its operators did not
give out access codes for other carriers.
   Residential and most business customers are able to use any
long-distance company, but they need to dial a five-digit access
code to use a carrier other than the one assigned to a particular
telephone.
   ``We regret that at the start of last week's service disruption
AT&amp;T operators were unable to help customers because we did not
have adequate procedures in place for such an unprecedented
situation,'' AT&amp;T chairman Robert Allen said Monday.
   AT&amp;T operators will now provide another carrier's access code if
they have the information, the company said in a news release. If
they do not have the codes, they will refer customers to local
telephone directories.
   AT&amp;T has about 70 percent of the long distance market in the
United States. MCI Communications Corp. is No. 2, with about 12
percent. US Sprint is third with about 8 percent, and about 700
other long distance carriers control the rest of the market.
   Each company has its own access code.
   The access code for MCI is 10222; US Sprint is 10333; and AT&amp;T
is 10288.
   Last week's outage was the most widespread ever at AT&amp;T and
effectively blocked about half the long-distance calls attempted,
company officials said.
   The Associated Press, quoting AT&amp;T spokesman Harry Baumgartner,
reported over the weekend that the company was considering a
mutual-aid agreement with its two top rivals.
   But another AT&amp;T spokesman, Walter Murphy, said Monday that the
AP report was ``unrealistic'' and that Baumgartner had either been
quoted out of context or misunderstood.
   Baumgartner was interviewed last week by an AP reporter and said
AT&amp;T was discussing the feasibility of asking MCI and US Sprint to
join it in agreement to help one another should one of their
systems shutdown.
   Walter Murphy, another AT&amp;T spokesman, said Monday the company
had not discussed such a plan and that there are no plans to do so.
He said the company would consider a number of options, but he
refused to say whether or not it included a so-called mutual-aid
agreement.
   ``I'm never going to say something's going to be ruled out
forever,'' Murphy said. But, he added, ``from our point of view
there are some obvious technical and legal problems in reaching
this kind of agreement.''
   Spokesmen for MCI and US Sprint told the AP last week that they
would welcome discussing a mutual aid agreement.

<HEAD>World's Worst Industrial Accident Drags on for Union Carbide</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   India's new government may only be
playing politics by trying to get $2.5 billion more from Union
Carbide Corp. for the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster, but the move could
keep the company under a legal cloud for years to come, some
analysts and lawyers said.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh traveled to an Indian shantytown on
Sunday and announced the government would scrap a $470 million
settlement to pursue criminal charges and the original $3 billion
in damages sought from Union Carbide.
   The news drove Union Carbide's stock down sharply Monday. But
some attorneys and the company say the settlement is perfectly
legal, and the government may only be trying to appeal to its new
constituents.
   ``I'm guessing, but I think in an attempt to appear populist the
new government might be doing a little bit of saber rattling,''
said Juan Noble, a chemical industry analyst for Argus Research
Corp. in New York. ``Nobody wants to give the impression they're
caving in and throwing in the towel.''
   About 3,500 were killed and 20,000 injured when a gas used in
making pesticides seeped from a storage tank at a Union Carbide
plant in Bhopal on Dec. 3, 1984.
   The government of Rajiv Gandhi originally sought $3 billion in
damages, but later settled for $470 million and agreed to absolve
the company of further criminal or civil liability. India's Supreme
Court accepted the deal last February.
   Danbury-based Union Carbide stands by the settlement as fair and
binding.
   ``The new administration may not dissolve the settlement because
it disagrees with it,'' said Joseph E. Geoghan, the company's
general counsel, in a statement issued last week. He was
unavailable for comment Monday.
   ``The case was settled and the government of India accepted the
settlement,'' said Fred H. Siemer, an analyst with Chemical
Research in New Yor. ``So if I was Carbide, I would just consider
the case closed.''
   Andreas Lowenfeld, a law professor at New York University, said
he believed the settlement would stand unless bribery or other
fraud were found to have influenced the agreement.
   ``It was not just a settlement,'' he said. ``Settlements are
hard to overturn but this was a settlement affirmed by the ...
Supreme Court. The chances of overturning seem quite slight to me.''
   Rob Hagen, a Washington attorney following the litigation, said
the new government could argue that fraud and collusion were
involved, or attack the settlement as unfair. He believes there is
some legal basis to reopen the issue in the 37 petitions filed
before a Supreme Court panel.
   ``Clearly it's a new ball game,'' Hagen said. ``It's going to be
an interesting story that's not going to go away.''
   But Singh's challenge may only be an effort to appear
sympathetic to his new constituents, some observers said.
   ``This could be just a political ploy,'' said Harvey Wachsman,
president of the American Board of Professional Liability
Attorneys. ``The other side of it is maybe he can get something
done. Then he looks like a prince. He's done all of this, and
Gandhi looks bad. It depends on the laws of India, and who knows
what's what.''
   Analysts were split on how the government's intervention could
affect Union Carbide financially.
   ``I would say as a practical matter this thing is probably going
to drag on for 10 or 15 years at least, and it's going to result in
extra legal expenses,'' said Donald A. Pattison, an analyst with
C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York. ``In the meantime
it's certainly not going to help the stock.''
   Union Carbide's stock fell $1.625 Monday to $20.875 a share.
   But Noble said he believed economic factors would continue to
drive the price of the stock.
   ``The Bhopal thing hasn't really been factored into my thinking
for quite a long time now,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A blue-ribbon advisory panel has panned a
congressional study critical of the specialist trading system at
stock exchanges and sent it back for a major reworking.
   The panel, consisting of market professionals, regulators,
academics and trade group representatives, sharply criticized the
draft report: ``Securities Markets and Information Technology,'' by
the Office of Technology Assessment, a congressional think tank.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, in a memo submitted to the OTA,
complained that ``important fundamental concepts are incorrecly
stated'' and ``basic facts are plainly wrong.''
   Among the points the CME disputed at a meeting of the advisory
panel Monday was the contention that intervention in securities
markets by Congress would make markets less efficient or drive them
out of the country to lands with fewer restrictions.
   ``In all categories were were unhappy with the way this was put
together,'' CME President William Brodsky said after Monday's
session.
   ``I think it was flawed and potentially disruptive,'' said
another panel member Eric K. Clemons, a professor of computer and
information science at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton
School. ``They were persuaded not to go forward yet'' with the
report, which has been in the works for 18 months.
   ``That's the way the panel procedure works,'' said Jean
McDonald, a spokeswoman for OTA, an arm of Congress that analyzes
science and technology and its potential impact.
   ``The idea is to get as accurate a report as you can,'' she
said, adding, ``They'll go back to the draft and look at it based
on the comments.
   Although the draft report has not been released, numerous press
accounts and some of the comment memos released by panel members
indicated it called for a centralized, computerized national market
system.
   The study also reportedly described the specialist system at the
New York and American stock excahnges as ``faltering'' and possibly
``irredeemably obsolete.''
   Under the specialist system of trading, stock can be traded only
through certain designated exchange members who are charged with
maintaining an orderly market in that security _ even if it means
buying or selling the stock because no other takers can be found.
   Critics have claimed the specialists are unable to keep up with
the massive volume that occurs in a market crisis like the 1987
crash, but supporters have said specialists stayed by their posts,
taking orders, when other traders weren't answering their phones
during the crash.
   The New York Stock Exchange, in a comment memo, said the draft
report ``in its present form, does not meet its stated goal of
`balance: fairly representing the views of major stakeholders.'''
   Among the other panelists was Alan Bretzer, vice president for
market regulation for the Midwest Stock Exchange in Chicago, Gene
L. Finn, chief economist for the National Association of Securities
Dealers and John C. Baldwin, director of the Utah Securities
Division.
   The final report will be submitted to a 12-member congressional
board _ equally divided between Democrats and Republicans, House
and Senate members _ which oversees the OTA.
   If approved by the board, the study will be released to the
public, said Ms. McDonald, adding that OTA does not make any
recommendations _ it only lays out policy options.
   The study was begun as an outgrowth of the 1987 stock market
crash, which critics claimed was worsened by computer-driven
program trading.

<HEAD>Chrysler, Austrian Co. to Make Minivans in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. and an Austrian automaker are
teaming up to begin European production of minivans, hoping
continental drivers will take a liking to the popular vehicle that
has propped up Chrysler's U.S. market share.
   Chrysler said Monday it would form a joint venture with
Steyr-Daimler-Puch Fahrzeugtechnik of Graz, Austria, to make the
vehicles beginning in the spring of 1991.
   The move indicates the growing importance of the European market
for American automakers. General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
have had assembly plants on the continent for decades, and strong
profits there in recent years have helped offset weakness at home.
   Chrysler had European manufacturing interests in the past, but
because of worsening finances the company in 1978 sold its holdings
in France, Britain and Spain to Peugeot for a 14 percent share in
the French company and $230 million.
   Chrysler two years ago began exporting some cars and minivans to
Europe under the Chrysler nameplate, along with its Jeep brand
sport-utility vehicles. Last year, Chrysler exported about 50,000
vehicles to Europe.
   It would be Chrysler's second joint venture with a European
automaker. Nearly a year ago, Chrysler and the French automaker
Renault announced a plan to build small sport-utility vehicles at
sites yet to be identified in North America and either Spain or
Portugal.
   That vehicle, code-named the ``JJ,'' is go into production in
1992 for the 1993 model year.
   Details of the Chrysler-Austrian project weren't available
Monday, Chrysler spokeswoman Karen Stewart said from company
headquarters in Highland Park, Mich. Production targets and
marketing plans won't be announced for about two months, she said.
   The minivan and sport-utility segments are relatively small in
the European market, but hold good potential for growth, analysts
say.
   For years, Volkswagen of West Germany has produced and marketed
a passenger van there, but its design differs from U.S. minivans.
The French vehicle maker Renault sells the Espace minivan but in
relatively low volumes.
   The U.S. market is different. Chrysler controls more than half
of the U.S. minivan market with its Plymouth Voyager, Dodge Caravan
and Chrysler Town &amp; Country vehicles, selling more than 500,000 of
the vehicles last year in North America. It exported about 8,800
minivans to Europe in 1989 from assembly plants in St. Louis, Mo.,
and Windsor, Ontario.
   U.S. sales of minivans and Jeeps, which carry some of the
largest profit margins in Chrysler's product line, have helped the
company's profits. But as the entire auto market sags, so do
minivan and Jeep sales.
   Analysts have predicted that Chrysler will report little, if
any, profit during the fourth-quarter of 1989. Meantime, they have
forecast that GM and Ford will report sharply lower profits but
that European operations will keep the Nos. 1 and 2 automakers in
the black.
   ``They had to so something a little different,'' auto analyst
Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. said of
Chrysler's European ambitions. ``If you wanted to start from
scratch, you would go to Spain or Portugal for the labor costs.
   ``This is an existing facility,'' she said of the Austrian
plant, ``so they save a lot of money and it's faster to get it into
production.''
   In 1983, American Motors Corp. established in China the Beijing
Jeep Corp., which Chrysler inherited when it bought AMC from
Renault in 1987. Chrysler owns about a third of Beijing Jeep, which
produces mostly commercial vehicles for the Chinese market.

<HEAD>More Wall Sreet Cuts Expected After $470 Million Merrill Lynch
Charge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dramatic $470 million charge by Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co. to cut businesses and personnel because of tough times on
Wall Street could speed bloodletting at other securities firms,
analysts say.
   The nation's biggest brokerage on Monday reported a $362 million
fourth-quarter loss, including the one-time charge for an
across-the-board restructuring expected to result in more than
4,000 staff cuts.
   The pretax charge, which analysts called the largest by a
securities firm for a restructuring, comes during wide retrenchment
on Wall Street because of slow business since the October 1987
stock market crash.
   For all of 1989, Merrill Lynch reported a loss of $213 million,
compared to profits of $463 million the previous year.
   Lawrence Eckenfelder, a securities industry analyst with
Prudential Bache Securities Corp. in San Francisco, said the size
of the charge may lead other firms that have not pruned as
drastically to step up cost-cutting.
   ``Merrill was clearly the biggest and certainly one of the most
inefficient firms out there,'' he said. ``What it suggests is
there's an awful lot more to come, I'm sure at other firms as
well.''
   Wall Street has lost more than 23,000 jobs since the crash,
which followed broad expansion during the heady bull market.
Merrill's cuts have been the most stunning because of the firm's
pre-eminence.
   Only Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which has cut its work force
by more than 50 percent since resolving government securities fraud
charges, has engineered a more severe reduction.
   ``The restructuring charge that we took was planned and
deliberate in response to the difficult market we face in our
industry,'' Merrill Lynch President Daniel P. Tully said in an
interview.
   ``It's a recognition that there's been a sea change in the
industry...,'' he said.
   Tully said the charge included $120 million for severance
payments, $125 million to write down the value of existing assets
and $220 million to cover office sales and lease payments.
   Merrill officials said they expected the restructuring
eventually would save $100 million to $200 million a year.
   Merrill blamed the overall 1989 decline on hard times
characterized by an exodus of small investors, slumping investment
banking profits that reflect a decline in merger activity, a severe
drop in the junk bond market and increased competition.
   The firm, touted as ``A Breed Apart'' in newspaper and
television advertisements, expanded aggressively during the
mid-1980s, diversifying its businesses and reaching a peak
employment of 47,000 shortly before the crash.
   By the end of the year, Merrill is expected to have a total work
force of around 36,800, compared with 40,500 at the end of 1989.
   ``This is a definite indication that no securities firm can be
all things to all people,'' said industry analyst Perrin Long of
Lipper Analytical Services.
   Merrill's quarterly loss, which amounted to $3.56 a share,
compared with earnings of $276 million, or $2.69 a share, for the
same 1988 period. Revenue for the quarter ending Dec. 29 was $2.8
billion, up from $2.67 billion in the 1988 quarter.
   For the full year, Merrill reported a per-share loss of $2.31.
In 1988, Merrill reported a profit of $463 million, or $4.29 a
share. Revenue for 1989 was $11.3 billion, up 16 percent from $9.75
billion in 1988.
   The revenue increase was due mainly to a 35 percent rise in
interest and dividends. Revenue sank 18.6 percent for principal
transactions and 6.3 percent from investment banking, while
commission revenue gained 12.3 percent.
   Merrill said the two areas of decline reflected markdowns in the
firm's inventory of high-yield bonds. The junk bond market was
battered in 1989 because of a series of huge defaults and declines
in the use of the securities to finance mergers and takeovers.
   The firm's 1988 full-year and fourth-quarter results included a
$255 million after-tax gain from the termination of a Merrill
pension plan.
   Merrill plans to eliminate about 3,000 jobs by the end of 1990
through layoffs, attrition and selling off businesses. In addition,
Merrill recently cut 700 positions by selling its Canadian retail
brokerage operation and eliminated 300 more jobs through cuts in
its Broadcort Capital Corp. account-clearing business.
   Since November, Merrill also has abandoned the European
commercial paper business, eliminated one equity division at its
New York headquarters and reduced trading of British stocks.

<HEAD>Intel In Joint Chip Venture with Japanese Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intel Corp. has entered into a joint
venture with a Japanese company to make and sell dynamic random
access memory chips, the most commonly used chip for storing
information in computers, the companies announced.
   The Japanese company, NMB Semiconductor, has two factories in
Japan making 256K and 1-megabit D-RAMS, and it plans a third plant
to build 4-megabit chips.
   The announcement said a fourth plant will be built in the United
States but added that details regarding the U.S. plant won't be
disclosed until later.
   Under the agreement, Intel, as majority partner in the joint
venture, will take over distribution of all of NMB's output by the
third quarter of this year, the companies said.
   NMB currently sells its chips through Minebea, a major
ball-bearing maker that is a big shareholder in NMB, the statement
said.
   American companies invented the D-RAM, but Japanese companies in
the past decade have taken over 75 percent of the market by
underpricing U.S. rivals.
   ``This arrangement will provide our customers with another U.S.
source of DRAMs, which is critical to the U.S. computer industry,''
said Intel Chairman Gordon Moore.
   Concern about the dependability of foreign supplies led Intel
and six other high-technology companies to band together in an
effort to resume large-scale domestic D-RAM production, but the
planned venture, U.S. Memories, collapsed last week because of
insufficient backing.

<HEAD>Corporate R&amp;D Spending Reportedly Fell in Real Terms; First Time
in 14 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporate spending on research and development
did not keep pace with inflation last year, the first time American
R&amp;D outlays have declined in real terms in 14 years, a newspaper
reported Monday.
   Figures due to be released within a week by the National Science
Foundation shows that U.S. corporations spent $68.8 billion on
research and development in 1989, compared to $66.5 billion in
1988, The New York Times reported in Tuesday's editions.
   When adjusted for inflation, however, the 1989 spending total
represented a decline of 0.9 percent from the previous year, the
newspaper said.
   Economists and corporate research executives say the decline is
particularly worrying because R&amp;D spending increasingly is being
shifted from basic research to the development of specific
products, reducing the chances of fundamental breakthroughs, the
Times said.
   In addition, a smaller portion of research is being done in
large laboratories where resources can be pooled, limiting the
opportunity for significant advances, the newspaper said.
   The decline in corporate research spending has been attributed
to a number of factors including high interest rates, an increasing
focus by company managers on short-term performance and
cost-cutting that accompanies corporate restructurings, mergers and
leveraged buyouts, the Times said.

<HEAD>Engine Fires Again Prompt Fiero Recall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. will recall all 244,000
four-cylinder Pontiac Fieros because of a persistent engine fire
threat, but it won't say when.
   ``We've notified NHTSA (the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration) of our intent to conduct a recall,'' GM spokesman
Tom Pyden said Monday. ``We are still determining the fix
(procedure) and until that point it is premature to come out and
notify owners and dealers.
   ``NHTSA was fully aware of our actions and as soon as we were
ready to go, we were going to issue dealer and customer
notification and a news release.''
   On Friday, the National Transportation Safety Board caught GM by
surprise when it included in its monthly safety investigation
report that GM had notified it of plans to recall every
four-cylinder Fiero built.
   Engine fires contributed to the demise of the two-seat,
plastic-body sports car that Pontiac dealers sold for five years.
   The mid-engine car was introduced in September 1983 as a 1984
model and got off to a quick sales start. GM announced cancellation
of the Fiero in March 1988 after 1984 models were recalled once
amid reports of engine malfunctions causing engine fires.
   NHTSA spokesman Tim Hurd said Monday the agency received a
letter dated Dec. 28, 1989, from GM saying the company would recall
the cars. Hurd declined to say if it was unusual for a month to
pass between the time the agency was notified and a recall actually
being issued.
   ``It is my understanding that the previous fix has not solved
the problem of fires in Fieros,'' Hurd said from Washington. ``I'm
sure that GM is working as hard as it can in good faith to get this
problem solved.''
   It is the second time the four-cylinder Fiero has been recalled
because of possible engine fires. Pontiac made about 100,000
six-cylinder Fieros, which will not be subject to the recall.
   In 1987, GM recalled 125,000 Fieros after engine fires had
occurred in one of every 400 cars. The company said engine
connecting rods, which link pistons to the crankshaft, could blast
through the side of the engine, causing an oil leak that could lead
to fire.
   During that recall, GM made some alterations, including boosting
oil capacity to four quarts from three and urging motorists to
check the engine oil every time they got gas.
   GM spokesman Reggie Harris said the automaker was caught unaware
by the NHTSA's announcement of the recall.
   ``We were working with NHTSA on the orderly process for
preparing for the parts validation,'' Harris said of repair work
tests. ``This is unusual. Normally, we would make our own
announcement when we have a program in place.''
   GM began making the Fiero at a plant in Pontiac in January 1983
for the 1984 model year, when it sold 101,720 Fieros. The first car
rolled off the assembly line in July 1983, with a base price of
$7,999.
   In the 1985 model-year, sales slipped to 90,691, falling to
71,283 in 1986, 47,156 in 1987 and 24,621 in 1988.

<HEAD>Government Filed Objection With U.S. Regulators Over Hoylake Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's Department of Trade and Industry
confirmed Tuesday it filed objections with nine U.S. state
insurance regulators over Hoylake Investment Ltd.'s $22 billion bid
for BAT Industries PLC.
   The objections focused largely on concern over the potential
negative impact of an ownership change on insurance policyholders
serviced by BAT's Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles.
   Hoylake, a bidding group led by the Anglo-French financier Sir
James Goldsmith, has said it intends to dispose of Farmers and
BAT's British insurance business Allied Dunbar to pay off debt
incurred through the highly leverage hostile takeover of BAT.
   BAT also has interests in tobacco, retailing, paper and other
financial services.
   U.S. regulators are reviewing the plan for its impact on Farmer
policyholders.
   The initial bid by Hoylake was allowed to lapse by the trade
department last year pending the U.S. regulatory reviews.
   A trade department official, who wasn't identified in accordance
with British custom, said the letter of objection, dated Sept. 11,
was filed prior to the actual lapsing of the initial bid on Sept.
29.
   The department's letter was made public Monday by Illinois
insurance regulators.
   The department official said the letter was part of the
department's normal regulatory activity. He noted that further
British regulatory review would still be required if Hoylake
launches a new bid for BAT.
   A Hoylake spokesman, also speaking anonymously, played down the
significance of the department's letter. He said it was ``purely
procedural'' and had to be filed to meet British statutory
deadlines of government comment.
   The U.S. regulatory review of Hoylake's offer isn't expected to
be completed until sometime in the second quarter. A new bid from
Hoylake for BAT might not come until midyear.
   BAT, meanwhile, is in the process of disposing of an estimated
$6.6 billion in assets in an effort to fight off the Hoylake bid.

<HEAD>Hooker Gets OK for Real Estate Firm to Handle Property Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Bankruptcy Court has given LJ Hooker
Corp. permission to hire a real estate firm to help it sell five
major commercial properties in four states.
   The holdings to be sold are the Forest Fair Mall near
Cincinnati, Richland Fashion Mall near Columbia, S.C., Thornton
Town Center Mall near Denver, Colo., the Gateway Mall site in
Atlanta and the almost-completed Ten Peachtree Office Center in
Atlanta.
   The Atlanta-based Hooker, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection last August, said Monday the bankruptcy court has given
it permission to hire Jones Lang Wootton U.S.A. of New York to
market the properties.
   ``We believe that the sale of these properties to companies that
can invest in and otherwise maximize their value will be in the
best interest of the malls, as well as our creditors and other
business entities,'' said Sanford C. Sigoloff, whose firm was hired
to manage Hooker during its Chapter 11 reorganization.
   Sigoloff said he and Jones Lang Wootton already have met with
prospective buyers and have had a ``substantial number'' of
discussions about the sales.
   LJ Hooker, the U.S. subsidiary of Australia's Hooker Corp., said
last year, prior to the bankruptcy court filing, it planned to sell
about $760 million in assets to deal with debts stemming from its
expansion in this country.
   A $409 million bid by an Atlanta-based investment group for
Hooker's American real estate holdings was dropped earlier this
month when an agreement could not be reached on the terms.
   Hooker also is withdrawing from retailing in the United States.
It is liquidating its B. Altman &amp; Co. department store chain and
the Bonwit Teller chain is for sale.

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. Ltd. workers on Tuesday voted
whether to accept an improved pay offer from the automaker or go on
strike.
   The results were not expected to be released until Thursday.
   The 32,000 workers at Ford's 22 plants in Britain were voting on
a pay rise offer of 10.2 percent in the first year, and 8 percent,
or a choice of the inflation rate plus 2.5 percent, in the second
year.
   The majority of Ford's workers earn an average $369 a week.
   Union leaders rejected the offer last week. If the workers also
reject it, they plan to go on strike starting with the last shift
on Friday.
   Ford said 550 workers were staging an indefinite, unofficial
strike at its Halewood plant in northwest England, prompting Ford
to lay off another 8,000 workers there and shut the plant.
   The other plants were operating normally, Ford said.
   The sporadic wildcat strikes and layoffs began last week.

   A bond trader became the first to plead guilty to
racketeering in a federal probe of suspected fraud at the nation's
largest futures exchanges.
   Meanwhile, a prosecutor revealed that more indictments will be
sought.
   Howard J. Goberstein, 33, entered an agreement Monday in which
the government promised to drop several pending mail fraud counts
against him in exchange for a guilty plea.
   Goberstein also agreed to cooperate fully with the ongoing
investigation of trading practices at the Chicago Board of Trade
and Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Goberstein was the last of three traders indicted on charges of
cheating customers while executing trades in the U.S. Treasury Bond
pit at the Board of Trade. The other two pleaded guilty to lesser
charges.
   A total of 47 traders and one clerk have been indicted so far in
the government probe. Assistant U.S. Attorney James M. Conway said
Monday prosecutors intend to return soon to the grand jury ``to
seek additional indictments.''
   U.S. District Judge James B. Zagel set Goberstein's sentencing
for March 26. Goberstein could be sentenced to a maximum 20 years
in prison and fined as much as $250,000 under the racketeering
statute.
   He is the first person in the probe to plead guilty to violating
the statute, a controversial law that some defense attorneys
contend was misused by federal prosecutors to force cooperation
from defendants early in the investigation.
   Under questioning from Zagel, Goberstein said he engaged in
prearranged trades and other illegal acts three times between
August and November 1988 while acting as a floor broker for
Lind-Waldock Inc.

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators today ordered a suspension of
CenTrust Savings Bank stock trading because of what they called
misleading and inaccurate financial reports from the troubled
thrift.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision halted trading on CenTrust
stock on the American and Midwest stock exchanges at 9 a.m. EST,
said thrift office spokesman William Fulwider in Washington.
   Fulwider said the action stems from the Miami-based thrift's
Jan. 16 filing of its financial report for the fiscal year ending
Sept. 30, 1989.
   The thrift office alleges CenTrust misrepresented various
aspects of its portfolio, including characterizing securities as
commericial loans and failing to acknowledge certain securities
were used for investment purposes.
   Fulwider also noted that CenTrust failed to provide the thrift
office with three full years of audited financial statements
despite repeated requests, and the thrift did not accurately report
losses that would have wiped out shareholder equity.
   Fulwider would not say if federal regulators would take control
of CenTrust, which reported a $119 million loss for the fiscal year.
   ``CenTrust ... fails to appraise the impact of these issues and
the impact on shareholders and disclose the magnitute of the
dispute between the OTS and CenTrust.''
   CenTrust stock closed Monday at 75 cents on the American Stock
Exchange.
   The charges made today by the thrift office against CenTrust are
similar to the claims made last month in a cease-and-desist order
filed with the U.S. District Court in Washington.
   CenTrust, one of the most visible thrifts in the crisis-ridden
thrift industry, has been criticized for lavish and unorthodox
spending, including a $30 million art collection, a company yacht
and high executive salaries.
   The state Office of Comptroller filed an order Dec. 20 seeking
to oust CenTrust Chairman David Paul, who took a $4.8 million
salary from January 1988 to September 1989.
   Paul is challenging the removal order, but a hearing has not
been set.
   A proposed merger between CenTrust and New York-based Ensign
Bank was called off last week.
   CenTrust spokesman Roy Winnick in New York said the company was
preparing a statement on the thrift office action.

<TEXT>
   Billionaire financier Michael Milken was
subpoenaed today by the House Banking Committee as part of a new
investigation of the role of junk bonds in savings and loan
failures.
   The committee, which conducted hearings last fall on the failure
of Charles H. Keating Jr.'s Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of
Irvine, Calif., voted 31-1 to subpoena Milken and two men involved
in land deals with Lincoln, Ernest Garcia and Fernando Acosta.
   Meanwhile, Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson said a fresh
look by thrift regulators at the financial condition of the S&amp;L
industry may determine that President Bush's bailout plan, which
provides $50 billion over three years, is inadequate.
   ``We do not yet know whether (the $50 billion estimate) will
prove accurate because of many variables that continue to exist.
These include the pattern of interest rates, the performance of
local real estate markets, and the general condition of regional
economies,'' Robson said, adding, ``It is possible that the $50
billion will prove inadequate.''
   He said the Office of Thrift Supervision is updating its list of
institutions likely to fail in the next 2{ years, ``which may
indicate resolution costs beyond the original estimates.''
   The committee is calling Milken as part of an examination of the
junk bond trading of several institutions, including Lincoln;
Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver, and
CenTrust Savings of Miami. President Bush's son, Neil, served on
the board of Silverado and regulators are considering action
against him.
   Federal regulators today ordered a suspension of CenTrust stock
trading because of what they called misleading and inaccurate
financial reports. The Office of Thrift Supervision alleges
CenTrust misrepresented various aspects of its portfolio, including
characterizing securities as commericial loans and failing to
acknowledge certain securities were used for investment purposes.
   The appearance of Garcia and Acosta ``would complete phase one
of the committee's investigation of ... Lincoln'' while Milken's
testimony would ``signal phase two ... (and) will concentrate on
the extent to which trading in junk bonds and subordinated debt
contributed to the collapse of Lincoln and other savings
institutions,'' said Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of
the panel.
   Milken asserted his constitutional right against
self-incrimination when he appeared in 1988 before a subcommittee
of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   He since has been indicted on 98 counts of securities fraud
related to deals he put together while head of the junk bond unit
of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. His trial is expected to start later
this year.
   Earlier this month, Garcia refused to testify in U.S. District
Court when summoned as a witness in Keating's attempt to overturn
the federal seizure of his thrift.
   Today's hearing was the first of three by the House panel into
the administration's conduct of the cleanup since enactment of the
Bush plan Aug. 9. The Senate Banking Committee is following with a
fourth session next week.
   Democrats on the House panel were pressing for faster action on
what amounts to the largest thrift institution and real estate sale
in history.
   ``The nature of the problem would have justified hitting the
ground running in August, but they didn't do that,'' said Rep.
Bruce Vento, D-Minn., who chairs a House task force overseeing the
bailout. ``We have to get them moving.''
   The Resolution Trust Corp., after an initial flurry of activity,
has dramatically slowed the pace of S&amp;L sales. In its first two
months, it disposed of 33 failed S&amp;Ls out of the 262 it had
inherited.
   But in the three months since then, it has disposed of only
seven institutions and its portfolio of failed S&amp;Ls is growing
faster than its list of resolutions.
   This month, the RTC put 51 of its institutions on the auction
block, bringing the total offered for sale up to 70. It also
released an inventory of 30,000 pieces of real estate available in
45 states.
   At the end of last week, the RTC had 302 institutions with $113
billion in assets left and expected to take control of another 200
bankrupt thrifts in coming months.
   The S&amp;L bill provided $50 billion to cover the losses in failed
thrifts and RTC officials say they need an additional $40 billion
to $100 billion in working capital. The working capital would be
repaid as the government sells assets from the failed S&amp;Ls and
would not increase the ultimate cost of the bailout.

<HEAD>Earnings Slip in 4th Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southwestern Bell Corp., one of the seven
regional telephone companies, reported today a slight decline in
profit for the fourth quarter, primarily because of some
end-of-the-year accounting adjustments.
   The company, which serves about 9.5 million homes and businesses
in five states, had net income in the quarter of $297.2 million, or
99 cents a share, compared with $305.2 million or $1.02 a share for
the same period a year ago.
   Southwestern Bell spokesman Gary Ford said the 2.6 percent
decline in earnings was caused by several one-time bookkeeping
changes including how the company accounts for its life insurance
premiums.
   Sales for the quarter, which ended Dec. 31, were $2.3 billion,
up 6.3 percent from last year's $2.1 billion.
   Besides providing phone service in Missouri, Oklahoma, Kansas,
Arkansas and Texas, Southwestern Bell is one of the nation's
largest makers of pagers and is a major supplier of cellular
telephone service.
   For the year, the company's profit and sales each increased just
over 3 percent. Net income for 1989 was $1.09 billion, or $3.64 a
share, compared to $1.06 billion, or $3.53 a share, in 1988. Sales
were $8.72 billion in 1989, compared to $8.45 billion in 1988.
   ``Last year was one of excellent growth for our business,'' said
Edward Whitacre, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer for
Southwestern.
   Ford said the company's telephone operations grew faster in 1989
than in any year since 1978. The phone company added 419,000 access
lines for the year, compared with 235,000 lines in 1988.
   Improved economies in Texas and Oklahoma prompted the growth
spurt, Ford said. But about a third of the increase came from the
company's effort to persuade homeowners to put in a second phone
line, he said.
   Another strong area for the company in 1989 was its mobile
cellular phone systems division which set its third quarterly
record for customer growth in the fourth quarter.
   Overall, the Mobile Systems division grew 57 percent in 1989.

   Prices were mixed on Wall Street today as
worries about interest rates and corporate earnings continued to
weigh on the stock market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 1.13 to 2,601.58
as of noon EST. The widely-followed blue chip indicator changed
directions several times during the morning and at one point was up
more than 20 points.
   Broader market indicators were down. Declining issues were ahead
of advancers by a margin of nearly 9 to 5, with 485 stocks rising,
882 falling and 485 unchanged on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 93.98 million shares at midday.
   The market surged higher in the opening minutes of trading today
but quickly fell back. Analysts said there was not enough buying
momentum for Wall Street to recover from Monday's sharp drop, in
which the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 77 points,
its largest one-day point loss since a 190-point plunge Oct. 13.
   Monday's decline was attributed to concerns about interest rates
and lower corporate profits, and analysts said those fears lingered
on Wall Street today.
   ``It's an ongoing negative scenario,'' said Jack Baker, head of
block trading, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Baker said the selling wave seemed to be running out of steam,
but ``I don't think without some good news that the market's going
to be able to do much today.''
   The most actively-traded issue on the NYSE was Bank of New

down 0.69 at 182.51. On the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index fell 2.44 to 358.44.

   Florida's revenue director was
suspended today on suspicion of having a businessman's taxes
investigated for political reasons.
   Gov. Bob Martinez and the Cabinet suspended Katie Tucker for 10
days with pay to allow her to explain her role in the Revenue
Department probe of businesses owned by Donald G. Resha, a
political opponent of her husband's.
   ``I think any time there is either the perception or in fact the
reality that it is using power granted to it ... in a wrongful way,
it certainly gives me a great deal of concern,'' Gov. Bob Martinez
said before the Cabinet meeting.
   Ms. Tucker was traveling to Tallahassee this morning and was not
available for comment.
   The Florida Department of Law Enforcement released a report
Monday suggesting Resha was investigated for political reasons.
   Resha unsuccessfully ran against Ms. Tucker's husband, Daniel
Miller, for president of the state AFL-CIO in 1985.
   The report said Ms. Tucker did not break any laws.
   Resha's bookstore and two video stores were subjected to a
five-month investigation into allegations of pornography and sales
tax violations.
   The probe found no wrongdoing, but the businesses were then
audited. The audit found that Resha owed $588.18 in taxes,
penalties and interest, which he paid.
   Last week, Ms. Tucker denied that she targeted Resha's
businesses and said she intended the first investigation to include
all Tallahassee book and video stores.
   She told FDLE investigators that a state legislator was
concerned the stores were used as fronts for illegal activity,
including pornography.
   But FDLE investigators concluded, ``The only intelligence
information concerning Resha's alleged involvement originated from
Ms. Tucker.''
   Martinez said Ms. Tucker should have taken any concerns she had
about criminal wrongdoing in Tallahassee bookstores to law
enforcement authorities.

<HEAD>Reach Accord In Computer Chips Dumping Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community Commission and
Japan have settled a three-year inquiry into the dumping of
Japanese computer chips at unusually low prices in the European
market, the commission said Tuesday.
   In a statement, the commission said that 11 Japanese companies
agreed to set a minimum price for their chips, amounting to the
average production cost plus a 9.5 percent profit margin.
   The agreement was a ``sufficient guarantee against price
competition from Japan,'' the commission said.
   The companies involved were Fujitsu, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, NEC,
NMB, Oki, Texas Instruments Japan, Toshiba, Matsushita, Sanyo and
Sharp.
   The agreement also applies to new generation computer chips,
which is unprecedented in an antidumping accord, although these
chips could be sold beneath the minimum price for a ``certain
period'' in the interests of users, the commission said.
   In addition, minimum prices will not be imposed on samples, it
said.
   The accord ends a three-year inquiry into extensive dumping of
Dynamic Random Access Memory Chips, known as DRAMS, in the
12-nation EC.
   DRAMS are highly standardized microcircuits used in great
quantities in computers, telecommunications products and other
high-tech applications.
   Japan's share of the DRAMS' market rose to 81 percent in 1986
from 24.6 percent in 1983. Before and during this three-year
period, DRAM prices fell considerably on the EC and world markets.
   The sharp fall in prices was ``clearly the consequence of a
deliberate pricing policy'' of the Japanese producers, the
commission said.
   Evidence also was found of serious damage to European chip
producers who either did not use their full production capacity or
had to curtail plans to increase capacity because of the low
prices. Companies had ``significant'' losses as a result, the
commission said.
   The dumping allegations were made by the European Electronic
Manufacturers' Association, which includes SGS, Siemens AG and
Thomson SA.
   The commission said the accord should not only stop massive
dumping of chips, but also should enable users to buy DRAMS at
competitive prices.
   An EC Commission spokesman said the commission had consulted
users before setting the final terms of the agreement. The
agreement will be reviewed in September 1991 when a similar price
accord between the United States and Japan expires.

   Merck &amp; Co. Inc. said Tuesday its net income
for the fourth quarter of 1989 rose 20 percent on a 10 percent
revenue increase.
   The health products maker said it earned $367.9 million, or 93
cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31 compared with
$307.3 million, or 77 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose to $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion in
1988.
   ``Strong unit volume gains were registered by both our domestic
and international operations,'' Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, Merck's
chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. ``The
effect of a stronger U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies
reduced sales growth by 3 percentage points in the fourth quarter
and for the year.''
   He said the sale of the company's interest in its former
Japanese affiliate, Torii &amp; Co. Ltd., reduced the sales figure
another 2 percentage points.
   For the 12 months ending Dec. 31, the company registered net
income of $1.5 billion, or $3.78 a share, up 24 percent from $1.21
billion, or $3.05 a share, in 1988. Sales for the year increased to
$6.55 billion from $5.94 billion in 1988.

<TEXT>
   Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co.
said Tuesday its earnings increased 7.4 percent in the fourth
quarter and 7.8 percent for the year.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, the company which is also
known as 3M earned $292 million, or $1.31 a share, compared with
$272 million, or $1.21 a share, in the same period a year ago.
   Fourth-quarter sales rose to $2.95 billion from $2.75 billion in
1988.
   For the year, the company earned $1.24 billion, or $5.60 a
share, compared with $1.15 billion, or $5.09 a share, in 1988.
Annual earnings per share increased 10 percent, partly because of a
reduction in the number of outstanding shares.
   Annual sales grew to $11.99 billion, up 5.9 percent from $11.32
billion in 1988.
   Allen F. Jacobson, chairman and chief executive, said 1989's
earnings growth was led by the division that makes videotape, X-ray
film and other imaging systems. In addition, the company's
international business posted its eighth consecutive quarter of
double-digit unit-volume gains and 3M exported $1 billion of goods
during 1989 for the first time.
   Jacobson said 3M expects higher sales and earnings again in 1990
despite some forecasts of overall economic sluggishness.

<HEAD>Mobil Corp. Reports Lower 4Q Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mobil Corp.'s profits fell 3 percent in the
fourth quarter as marketing, refining and chemicals earnings
declined, the company said Tuesday.
   For the three-month period ended Dec. 31, Mobil's after-tax
profit was $447 million, or $1.08 a share, down from $462 million,
or $1.12 a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 13 percent to $15
billion from $13.4 billion.
   Mobil, the second largest U.S. oil company behind Exxon Corp.,
said higher crude oil prices helped boost earnings in its
exploration and business sector and largely offset lower marketing
and refining margins.
   Chemicals earnings fell sharply consistent with an industry-wide
slump due to lower world prices for petrochemicals, Mobil said.
Nevertheless, chemicals earnings for the year of $573 million were
second only to $613 million in 1988, a record year, the company
said.
   Mobil said an income tax change and Montgomery Ward-related
income benefited fourth-quarter 1988 earnings by a total of $58
million. Excluding those effects, Mobil's earnings would have
improved 11 percent, the company said.
   For the year, New York-based Mobil earned $1.8 billion, or $4.40
a share, down 13 percent from $2.1 billion, or $5.07 a share, in
1988. Sales edged up 4 percent to $56.7 billion from $54.4 billion.

   London shares finished lower Tuesday after a
choppy session.
   At the close of trading, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was down 6.0 points, or 0.3 percent, at 2,291.1. It
was up from a session low of 2,282.9 points, but down from a high
of 2,305.9.
   Volume was a moderate 539.3 million shares, up sharply from
365.0 million on Monday.
   Trading got off to a rocky start following Monday's 77-point
fall in the Dow Jones average on Wall Street.
   London shares later were lifted by an encouraging start Tuesday
on Wall Street, but late in the session they began to retreat as
the Dow Jones average dipped into negative territory. At the end of
the London day, the U.S. blue-chip average had dipped to 2,595.27
after rising as high as 2,615.14.
   ``We're slaves to Wall Street,'' said one London firm's managing
director. ``One thing is for certain, our fixation with overseas
markets is killing any trade here.''
   Another market watcher described London trading as ``thin and
tricky.''
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 0.5 point at 1,839.6
points at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 4.41
points to close at 1,253.69.

<HEAD>Shearson Posts Modest Quarterly Profit; Morgan Stanley's Income Up
Strongly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. on Tuesday
posted fourth-quarter earnings of $3.8 million, a slender profit
but a big improvement from the $13 million loss a year earlier.
   Parent companies of two smaller brokerages, Morgan Stanley Group
Inc. and Piper Jaffray Inc., reported substantial income growth.
Morgan Stanley's earnings rose 37 percent in the three months ended
Dec. 31 while Piper Jaffray said its quarterly income almost
doubled from the year before.
   Shearson, which is partially owned by American Express Co., said
on a per-share basis it had a loss of 3 cents, which was far
narrower than the 22 cent loss in 1988's fourth quarter.
   More shares of common stock and equivalents were outstanding in
last year's fourth quarter than in 1988, Shearson said. The
per-share figures were computed after taking into account preferred
stock dividend requirements.
   Revenue edged up less than 1 percent to $2.93 billion from $2.91
billion in the closing three months of 1988.
   Higher commissions, net interest income and revenue from
market-making and principal transactions contributed to Shearson's
overall income growth.
   These positive factors helped reduce the drag on earnings from
the slowdown in investor activity after the Oct. 13 market slump
and uncertainty in high-yield bond markets, Shearson said.
   But the gains were partially offset by a decline in investment
banking revenue and by previously disclosed relocation and
severance expenses.
   Shearson and American Express announced on Dec. 14 a plan to
raise about $900 million in new capital for Shearson. The plan
included a reduction in American Express's stake in the brokerage
to less than 50 percent from 61 percent.
   American Express, which bought into Shearson in 1981, had wanted
to cut back its holding for some time to remove the brokerage's
erratic performance from its earnings report.
   Shearson's recapitalization is intended to shore up the
investment company's balance sheet but it isn't expected to
guarantee a turnaround during a time of sagging profits on Wall
Street.
   For all of 1989, Shearson said its after-tax income rose 14.6
percent to $110 million, or 95 cents a share, from $96 million, or
81 cents a share, in 1988. Revenue rose 19 percent to $12.5 billion
from $10.5 billion in 1988.
   Morgan Stanley, based in New York as is Shearson, said it earned
$148.6 million, or $3.80 a share, in the fourth quarter, up from
$108.3 million, or $2.84 a share, in 1988.
   Revenue, boosted by $137.7 million of investment gains from
Morgan's restructuring of its stake in Container Corp. of America,
rose 37 percent to $1.59 billion from $1.16 billion.
   Last year's net income came to $443 million, or $11.21 a share,
up 12 percent from $394.6 million, or $10.26 a share, in 1988.
Revenue rose 42 percent to $5.8 billion from $4.11 billion.
   The company said it benefited from the diversification of its
businesses, many of which turned in strong performances. Its
financial advisory business maintained an active pace and was
reinforced by the growth of cross-border mergers and acquisitions
as well as real estate advisory revenue.
   In underwriting, Morgan Stanley was among the industry leaders
in raising capital and, in merchant banking, the company realized
significant revenue from the restructuring of several of its
leveraged equity investments.
   In sales and trading, international equities, foreign exchange
and commodities contributed to Morgan Stanley's overall revenue
growth while fixed income did well considering the difficult market
conditions.
   Piper Jaffray, parent of the Minneapolis-based investment firm
Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc., reported earnings of $3.2 million,
or 79 cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, the first
quarter in the company's fiscal year. That was up from $1.6
million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 20 percent to $48.8 million from $40.6 million.
   Charles N. Hayssen, Piper Jaffray's chief financial officer,
said the total revenue growth reflected an almost 50 percent surge
in commission revenue. Mutual fund commissions were up more than 80
percent.
   He said institutional equity commissions also grew.
   ``Institutions are increasing their business with firms that
offer value-added research, timely investment advice and strong
trading capability,'' he said. ``This has allowed top non-New
York-based firms like Piper Jaffray to capture more market share.''

<HEAD>Soybeans End Higher; Grain Futures Close Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed modestly higher
Tuesday in quiet trading on the Chicago Board of Trade, boosted by
signs of stronger export sales and notions that the market was
oversold and due for a rally.
   Wheat futures ended mostly lower while corn futures were
narrowly mixed.
   ``All in all, it was a pretty subdued session,'' said analyst
Joel Karlin of Research Department Inc., a brokers' advisory
service based in Chicago.
   The Agriculture Department said late Monday in a weekly report
that it inspected 20.7 million bushels of soybeans for export last
week, a number higher than traders had expected.
   Wheat inspections of 21 million bushels also were above trade
estimates while corn inspections of 53.9 million bushels were about
as expected.
   Forecasts for above-normal precipitation early next week in the
winter wheat belt pressured wheat prices. But selling enthusiasm
was tempered by rumors that the USDA is preparing to target China
and the Soviet Union for more sales of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices, Karlin said.
   Wheat futures closed unchanged to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.92{ a bushel; corn futures
were { cent lower to 1 cent higher with March at $2.40\ a bushel;
oats were 1{ cents to 2 cents higher with March at $1.38\ a bushel;
soybeans were unchanged to 2 cents higher with March at $5.67 a
bushel.

<HEAD>Two Regional Phone Companies Post Weaker Profits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bell Atlantic Corp. said Tuesday its profit tumbled 81 percent
in the fourth quarter due largely to restructuring costs and
Southwestern Bell Corp. blamed bookkeeping changes for a slight 2.6
percent quarterly income decline.
   Bell Atlantic's after-tax earnings dropped to $57.9 million, or
29 cents a share, in 1989's fourth quarter from $302.6 million, or
$1.53 per share, in the final three months of 1988. Restructuring
costs cut its profit by about $263 million.
   The one-time charges covered the costs of inducing 1,700
managers to retire early or leave the company, revaluing spare
parts inventories and establishing a health and dental benefit
trust as agreed to in the latest labor contract, the company said.
A small amount of the restructuring charge included debt
refinancing.
   Between 1,000 and 1,200 mangers were to be offered the early
leave incentives, but Bell spokeswoman Cynthia M. Ciangio said more
managers than expected had asked to leave.
   ``Since more wanted to do it and we could do it as a corporation
we thought we would,'' she said.
   When the company announced the restructuring in September,
officials predicted the company would break even or post a small
profit in the fourth quarter.
   In the fourth quarter of 1989, Bell Atlantic saw a 4.2 percent
increase in operating revenue, to $2.89 billion from $2.77 billion.
   ``Our operating performance was very strong,'' said Raymond W.
Smith, Bell Atlantic chairman and chief executive officer, ``and we
have full confidence that in the 1990s we'll achieve our
earnings-growth target, which continues to be 6 to 9 percent per
year.''
   For all of 1989, net income dropped 18.4 percent to $1.08
billion, or $5.43 per share, from $1.32 billion, or $6.65 per
share. Annual revenue increased 5.2 percent to $11.45 billion from
1988's $10.88 billion. The impact of the restructuring on the
annual profit was $320.
   Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic is the parent company of New
Jersey Bell, Bell of Pennsylvania, Diamond State Telephone in
Delaware, and the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Companies in
Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington, D.C. Subsidiaries
also provide mobile telephone service and computer repair services.
   Southwestern Bell said the dip in fourth-quarter net income to
$297.2 million, or 99 cents a share, from $305.2 million, or $1.02
a share, a year before mainly occurred because of some year-end
accounting adjustments.
   Company spokesman Gary Ford said the one-time adjustments
included how the company accounts for its life insurance premiums.
   Sales for the quarter ended Dec. 31 were $2.3 billion, up 6.3
percent from the prior year's $2.1 billion.
   Southwestern Bell, based in St. Louis, serves about 9.5 million
homes and businesses in five states. Besides providing phone
service in Missouri, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas and Texas,
Southwestern Bell is one of the nation's largest makers of pagers
and is a major supplier of cellular telephone service.
   For the year, the company's profit and sales each increased just
over 3 percent. Net income for 1989 was $1.09 billion, or $3.64 a
share, compared to $1.06 billion, or $3.53 a share, in 1988. Sales
were $8.72 billion in 1989, compared to $8.45 billion in 1988.
   ``Last year was one of excellent growth for our business,'' said
Edward Whitacre, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of
Southwestern.
   Ford said the company's telephone operations grew faster in 1989
than in any year since 1978. The phone company added 419,000 access
lines for the year, compared with 235,000 lines in 1988.
   Improved economies in Texas and Oklahoma prompted the growth
spurt, Ford said. But about a third of the increase came from the
company's effort to persuade homeowners to put in a second phone
line, he said.
   Another strong area for the company in 1989 was its mobile
cellular phone systems division which set its third quarterly
record for customer growth in the fourth quarter.

   Stock prices closed widely mixed today as
traders, still pessimistic about interest rates and corporate
earnings, picked up blue chip issues but shied away from secondary
stocks.
   The blue chips posted moderate gains after bouncing up and down
throughout the day. However, the broader market was lower for much
of the session.
   Analysts said there was not enough buying momentum for the
market to recover from Monday's sharp drop, in which the Dow Jones
industrial average fell more than 77 points.
   ``Investors and speculators don't have the courage to buy
secondary stocks,'' said Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer
&amp; Co.
   Monday's decline was attributed to concerns about interest rates
and lower corporate profits, and analysts said those fears lingered
on Wall Street today.
   Jack Baker, head of block trading with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., said the selling wave seemed to be running out of steam, but
that the market had no reason to start a rally.

<HEAD>Disney Earnings Up 17.6 Percent In Latest Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Walt Disney Co. reported a 17.6
percent rise in its first-quarter profit Tuesday and credited
strong contributions from all its business segments for the results.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, Disney earned $174.4
million, or $1.26 per share, on revenue of $1.29 billion. That
compared with $148.3 million, or $1.08 per share, on revenue of
$1.04 billion in the same period a year earlier.
   Operating income increased 24 percent to $309.2 million.
   Disney said quarterly revenue for its theme parks and resorts
segment rose 21 percent over the prior year to $619.4 million, with
operating income up 35 percent to $164 million. The Disney-MGM
Studios park in Florida, opened in May 1989, contributed heavily to
the results, Disney said.
   Consumer products revenue rose 35 percent to $165.3 million,
with operating income in that segment up 26 percent to $67.9
million.
   Filmed entertainment revenue rose 23 percent over the prior year
to $503.4 million, with operating income up 3 percent to $77.2
million.
   Those results were the second highest ever for the film segment.
Theatrical, home video and television markets grew, due to
performances by ``The Little Mermaid'' animated film, the home
video ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' and booming international markets
for U.S. entertainment, Disney said.
   However, some recent Disney releases have fared poorly at the
box office, with ``Blaze'' among the more disappointing films.

<HEAD>Reports Operating Profits Up 29 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fiat Group, Italy's largest industrial
concern, reported Tuesday that its operating profit jumped 29
percent in 1989 as its revenue rose 17.8 percent.
   The Turin-based automaker said it earned 4.95 trillion lire, or
$3.96 billion, in 1989 compared with 3.83 trillion lire a year
earlier.
   Its revenue climbed to 52.2 trillion lire, or $41.8 billion,
from 44.31 trillion lire a year earlier.
   The announcements came in an annual letter from Fiat SPA
Chairman Giovanni Agnelli to shareholders.
   Although Fiat didn't disclose net results, it said net earnings
of parent company Fiat SPA ``should have reached around'' 1.2
trillion lire, or $960 million, up 20 percent from 1988.
   The increase in operating results topped analysts' expectations,
while the sales figures were roughly in line with industry
estimates. The operating margin _ operating income as a percentage
of sales _ rose to 9.5 percent from 8.6 percent in 1988.
   In his letter to shareholders, Agnelli noted that at the end of
1989, Fiat ``closed a ten-year cycle in which it reestablished its
economic and financial equilibrium and subsequently advanced goals
of expansion and economic and financial stability.''
   Agnelli emphasized the need to respond to the integration of the
Western European marketplace scheduled for 1992 and new economic
growth in Eastern Europe.
   ``The globalization of our competition requires that we develop
internationally through our internal capacity and the
multiplication of our external ties,'' Agnelli said in the letter.
   Agnelli attributed the 1989 revenue growth to a strong
performance by the company's auto division, although he noted all
divisions posted gains against those registered in 1988.
   The Fiat group, which produces Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Lancia
models, sold 2.3 million cars last year, up 4.7 percent from the
year before.
   Fiat has a 58 percent share of the domestic market. It ranks
second in terms of sales on the European car market, after
Volkswagen AG of West Germany.
   The car sector recorded sales of 28.240 trillion lire, or $22.59
billion, up 10.9 percent from 1988. The industrial vehicles sector
registered sales of 8.15 trillion lire, or $6.52 billion, up 8.9
percent.

<TEXT>
   With stock prices falling, interest rates rising
and warnings increasing of a worldwide business slump, the 1990s
are off to a scary start on Wall Street.
   Optimists still insist it is all nothing more than one of the
passing spells of anxiety that afflict the financial world even in
the best of times.
   But many other analysts wonder whether the bills incurred in the
ebullient `80s might at last be coming due, in the form of debt
defaults, bear markets and worsening woes for those who make their
living in the investment trade.
   Those fears, in turn, have stirred anxious visions of a
sustained market decline unlike anything this country has seen for
nearly a decade.
   ``There were all sorts of euphoric pronouncements of what the
new decade would bring,'' said William LeFevre at the firm Advest
Inc. ``Now that we're well into January, we may be experiencing a
sort of hangover from all that yearend euphoria.''
   In the stock market, the widely recognized Dow Jones average of
30 industrial stocks began 1990 by jumping to a record high of
2,810.15 on Jan. 2.
   Three weeks later, at Tuesday's close, it had fallen to
2,615.32, for a drop of 194.83 points, or nearly 7 percent, from
that peak.
   In the bond markets, meanwhile, interest rates have confounded
many of the experts by reversing their decline of late 1989, pushed
up by sharp rate increases in Japan, West Germany and other foreign
lands.
   That gave rise to fears of a global interest-rate war that could
significantly increase the chances of a recession.
   ``The recent decline in stock prices is in keeping with
fundamental changes in the economy and the financial markets,''
said Abby Joseph Cohen, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   ``The pace of economic activity has slowed and profits have
declined. Stock prices could decline further if other investors
come to share our conclusions.''
   Worries about the stock market of late have focused not so much
on another crash like the one that occurred in October 1987, or the
smaller shock that drove the Dow Jones industrial average down 190
points last Oct. 13.
   Though those experiences have shown that such calamities can hit
with little or no warning, what many observers fear most is these
days is a more prolonged period of financial malaise like the bear
markets of the 1970s and early 1980s.
   Such declines can devastate business and investment plans
through steady erosion rather than sudden collapse.
   So much time has passed since the last bear market, and so much
about the markets themselves has changed, that no one is sure what
a 1990s-style bear market might look like.
   ``A normal bear would last six to nine months,'' speculates the
Hirsch Organization, an Old Tappan, N.J. investment advisory firm,
in the current edition of its newsletter Ground Floor.
   On the other hand, the organization says, given the modern
influences of computer-program trading and nearly-instant
international flows of money, ``it could be quicker and sicker.''
   Should an extended decline in stock prices occur, it would stand
to deepen many economic worries now facing the country. But a good
many analysts hold out hope that it also would set the stage for
renewed growth and optimism a few months or years in the future.
   While stocks slumped in 1981-82, Wall Street veterans recall,
government policy measures and other events were working to curb
inflation in a campaign that eventually paid big bull-market
dividends.
   Said Rosanne Cahn, economist at First Boston Corp.: ``Like the
1980s, the economic environment of the 1990s is starting with the
job of correcting the prior decade's excesses.''

   Bankers Trust New York Corp. said Tuesday that
its profit for the final quarter of 1989 plunged 55 percent from a
year earlier, and it reported a loss of nearly $1 billion for the
entire year.
   The poor results reflected the bank's decision to increase its
loan-loss provision to cover shaky Third World debt. Several other
major commercial banks took similar action and also reported
depressed earnings.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, Bankers Trust netted $84.3
million, or $1.17 a share, down from earnings of $185.5 milion, or
$2.29 a share, in 1988.
   The company lost $979.9 million, or $12.10 a share, for all of
1989, compared with record net income of $647.7 million, or $8.09 a
share, in the previous year.
   During the third quarter of last year Bankers Trust added $1.6
billion to its loan-loss reserves. Excluding that provision, the
bank said it would have earned $620.1 million, or $7.51 a share.
   Bankers Trust said it had a higher provision for credit losses
in the fourth quarter, $147 million vs. $30 million in the 1988
period. That was partially offset by a drop in income taxes and
non-interest expenses, as well as higher non-interest revenue.
   Net charge-offs of Third World loans were $172 million in the
fourth quarter, including $114.3 million in non-performing
medium-and long-term loans to Brazil and $41 million to Argentina.

   The dollar lost value against all major foreign
currencies Tuesday and finished near its lowest levels of the day
in U.S. trading.
   Reports that the unrest was subsiding in Soviet Azerbaijan
halted the dollar's recent advance and renewed buying of West
German marks. Investor confidence in the dollar also was shaky in
the aftermath of Monday's sharp selloff on Wall Street.
   Gold prices rose strongly. In New York, gold for current
delivery gained $5.80 to close at $413 a troy ounce on the
Commodity Exchange. Republic National Bank of New York later quoted
an ounce of gold bullion at $412.50, up $4.30 from late Monday's
bid.
   Robert Morrissey, a currency trader at Bank of Boston, said the
recent political turmoil in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union had
spurred dollar demand and caused dealers to lighten their holdings
of marks.
   But sentiment turned against the dollar again Tuesday and
interest resurfaced in marks. Sales of dollars pushed the U.S.
currency past technical support levels and caused additional sales
amid trading maneuvers intended to prevent further losses.
   ``Right now the market is fairly bearish on the dollar and we
could see it trade lower,'' Morrissey said.
   Testimony by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
before a congressional committee had minimal impact on the
foreign-exchange markets, Morrissey said. Traders said Greenspan
left only a vague impression that interest rates might move lower
sometime in the future.
   The dollar's trading day began in Tokyo with a drop to 146.33
Japanese yen from 146.42 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London,
it fell to 146.03 yen and in New York, the dollar was quoted at
145.94 yen, down from 146.50 yen late Monday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6480 from $1.6385 late
Monday. In later New York trading, sterling strengthened further to
$1.6535 from $1.6370 late Monday.
   Selected dollar rates late Tuesday, compared with Monday's late
levels, included: 1.6960 West German marks, down from 1.7242;
1.5085 Swiss francs, down from 1.5350; 5.7655 French francs, down
from 5.859; 1.1785 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1801; and 1,262.25
Italian lire, down from 1,283.00 Italian lire.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late rates on
Monday, were: 1.6965 West German marks, down from 1.7230; 1.5070
Swiss francs, down from 1.5325; 5.7625 French francs, down from
5.8550; 1.9225 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9370; 1,262.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,281.50; and 1.1780 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1826.
   Gold prices posted sizable increases in trading around the world
while silver rose modestly.
   In London, gold rose to a late bid price of $413 a troy ounce,
up from $405.25 bid late Monday. In Zurich, Switzerland, the metal
rose to a closing bid of $408.50, up from $405.75 bid late Monday.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 54 cents to close at a bid of
$407.31.
   Silver for January delivery rose to $5.294 a troy ounce on New
York's Comex from Monday's settlement price of $5.268. Silver
bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $5.32 a troy ounce
from $5.20 bid late Monday.

<HEAD>Judge Enjoins Antar from Securities Violations; Orders Funds Back
to U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eddie Antar, founder of collapsed
electronics retailer Crazy Eddie Inc., reaped more than $60 million
by selling company stock based on figures in falsified financial
records, a federal judge said Tuesday.
   U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan found that Antar ``was
at the head of a scheme'' to overstate the company's income from
1985 to 1987 and benefited from the resulting higher stock price
when he sold his own Crazy Eddie shares.
   The judge also ordered Antar to repatriate $52 million that he
allegedly had transferred in 1987 to bank accounts in Israel.
   Politan made his findings in granting a motion by the Securities
and Exchange Commission to bar Antar from violating securities
laws, which was part of the SEC's civil insider trading suit
against Antar.
   The judge's decision did not represent a criminal finding.
Politan said he was relying on ``strong prima facie showings'' of
securities fraud based on the record before him, including included
legal briefs and testimony by company officials.
   Antar did not submit a statement. His attorneys opposed the
repartriation order, saying that even to admit the funds existed
might compromise their client's constitutional right against
self-incrimination.
   The government, which claims Antar transferred up to $68 million
out of the United States, had asked for repatriation of the funds
so that the money is available if it wins the insider trading case
and a restitution order against Antar.
   Any repatriated funds would be placed under supervision of a
trustee.
   ``It would be a compounding of a fraud to permit Mr. Antar free
reign over $60 million,'' Politan said.
   Antar built a single store in Brooklyn, N.Y., into a 43-outlet
regional chain known for advertisements featuring a loudmouthed
pitchman touting its ``insane'' prices.
   The SEC accused Antar and other former top management of insider
trading and altering the company's financial books. The executives
allegedly bought and sold Crazy Eddie stock based on inflated
financial figures regarding the company's performance and prospects.
   The company allegedly used a variety of methods to inflate
earnings, such as recording higher prices than actually were
charged customers and fabricating the quantities of items returned
to manufacturers.
   Crazy Eddie went into involuntary bankruptcy in October. Antar
and former officials also face a shareholder lawsuit in U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn, and a criminal investigation by the
U.S. attorney in Newark.
   SEC attorney Richard Simpson said a criminal indictment, if
returned, would not come for another three months.
   Politan also accepted the request by Antar's attorneys to put
the SEC civil case on hold for the next four months.
   The attorneys asked for the stay because they were unsure if the
U.S. attorney would seek forfeiture of Antar's legal fees under
federal racketeering law.
   Antar's lawyers argued that it was unfair for the Justice
Department to seek attorney fees in a criminal case, possibly
depriving Antar of legal defense against the SEC lawsuit.

   Prices were widely mixed in a choppy session on
Wall Street Tuesday as pessismim about interest rates and corporate
profits lingered in the stock market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.87 to 2,615.32
following a 77-point drop on Monday. The widely followed barometer
fluctuated in a 55-point range Tuesday, and gave up ground in the
last few minutes of trading.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of about 5 to
4 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 666 stocks rising, 864 down and 468 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 179.30 million
shares, up from 148.38 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 216.73 million shares.
   Prices surged higher at the opening _ with the Dow Jones
industrial average moving up more than 20 points _ but then
retreated within the first half-hour. Blue chip issues seesawed
throughout the day but secondary stocks were down for almost the
entire session.
   Market watchers said the pessimism about interest rates and
corporate profits that dragged stocks lower on Monday persisted
Tuesday, although the blue chip issues managed to attract some
buyers.
   ``Investors and speculators don't have the courage to buy
secondary stocks,'' said Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer
&amp; Co., who described the market as ``a combination of those looking
for an exit and those looking for bargains.''
   Another analyst, Alfred E. Goldman of A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.
in St. Louis, predicted the growing uncertainty about the economy
and first-half profits would lead to more declines.
   The last few minutes of Tuesday's session saw a renewed burst of
selling as both the stock and bond markets reacted to a
disappointing sale of government bonds intended to bail out the
savings and loan industry.
   Goldman said the late downturn did not bode well for Wednesday's
session.
   The most active issue on the NYSE Tuesday was Bank of New
England, which fell { to 3\.
   Merck rose 1 to 71~ and General Electric was down &lsqb; to 62} after
the companies announced fourth-quarter earnings that were in line
with Wall Street expectations.
   Hilton Hotels plunged 8} to 65{ after the company said it was
considering alternatives to a sale of the firm. Hilton had been
thinking of a sale since last summer.
   Among blue chip issues, AT&amp;T was up \ to 40} and IBM was up &lsqb; to
96}.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $3.373 billion, or 0.11
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.40 to 183.60.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index picked up 1.58 to close at
381.26, and S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.23 to 331.61.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 1.52 to 430.42. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 359.73, down 1.15.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Rally On Weak Dollar, Stock Market Jitters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices climbed sharply Tuesday on New York's
Commodity Exchange, erasing substantial losses posted in the three
previous sessions as investors spooked by the stock market sought
safer havens for their money.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures finished mostly lower;
grains and soybeans were mixed; and livestock and meat futures were
mixed.
   Gold futures settled $5.70 to $6.60 higher with the contract for
delivery in February up $5.70 at $413.70 a troy ounce. Silver
futures finished 2.5 cents to 2.9 cents higher with March at $5.34
a troy ounce.
   February gold had fallen a total of $5.70 since last Wednesday.
The tumble appeared to have halted on Monday when the contract fell
during the session to $404.70, representing a loss of $6.30, then
bounced back to finish only $2.90 lower.
   Monday's late rebound and Tuesday's rally appeared to stem from
buying linked to Monday's dive of more than 77 points in the Dow
Jones industrial average, said John Jonat, a trader with Deak
International Inc., a New York- based dealer of foreign currencies
and precious metals.
   The Dow finished with a gain of nearly 15 points Tuesday but
roller-coaster movement in blue-chip stocks kept investors on edge
and sent some running to the perceived safety of precious metals,
Jonat said.
   ``Frankly, I was a little worried when the stock market started
to move on the downside and that's what got things going'' in gold,
he said.
   The dollar's pronounced weakness Tuesday against other major
currencies also prompted some buying of gold futures, analysts said.
   Analysts said technical ``buy'' signals are surfacing in the
gold, silver and platinum markets, and the continued unrest in
Soviet Azerbaijan is also supportive.
   Most petroleum futures declined, reflecting weaker demand for
heating oil and the end to an eight-day strike by Brazilian
oilworkers.
   The American Petroleum Institute's weekly inventory data,
released after the close of trading, showed a continued expansion
in U.S. supplies of gasoline and petroleum distillates but a drop
in crude oil stocks.
   Crude oil supplies declined about 1 million barrels, the API
reported. Supplies of distillates, including heating oil, rose 3.4
million barrels while gasoline supplies rose by a surprisingly
large 4.6 million barrels.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 9 cents to 17 cents lower
with the contract for delivery in February at $18.93 a barrel;
wholesale home heating oil was 1.71 cents lower to .04 cent higher
with February at 59.28 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.02
cents lower to .55 cent higher with February at 59.62 cents a
gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange amid positioning ahead of Wednesday's quarterly
Agriculture Department cattle-on-feed report, which is expected to
show active placements of cattle onto and marketings off of feed
lots in the last quarter of 1989. Traders expect the report to show
a slight increase in the feedlot herd as of Jan. 1 compared with
the same date a year earlier.
   Live cattle futures settled .60 cent lower to .08 cent higher
with February at 78.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent
lower to .22 cent higher with January at 84.42 cents a pound; live
hogs were .35 cent lower to .38 cent higher with February at 49.77
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .03 cent to .47 cent lower
with February at 56.70 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures rose modestly in quiet trading on the Chicago
Board of Trade, boosted by signs of stronger export sales and
notions that the market was oversold and due for a rally. Corn and
wheat futures were mixed.
   Wheat futures prices settled 2 cents lower to } cent higher with
March at $3.92} a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1{ cents higher
with March at $2.40\ a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2\ cents
higher with March at $1.38{ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 2{

<HEAD>With AM-S&amp;L Bailout, AM-Bonds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government sold $5 billion of 40-year
bonds Tuesday to finance its bailout of the savings and loan
industry, the first time in 35 years it has offered debt of more
than 30 years' maturity.
   The bonds were sold at an average yield of 8.60 percent and will
carry a coupon interest rate of 8| percent with a $10,000 bond
selling for $10,026.70.
   The Resolution Funding Corp., or Refcorp, received bids totaling
$8.17 billion.
   It was the second time the Refcorp has auctioned bonds to help
finance the thrift bailout. It sold $4.5 billion in 30-year bonds
last October with an average yield of 8.15 percent, 27 basis points
above the 30-year Treasury bond yield of 7.88 percent. A basis
point is one-hundreth of a percentage point.
   Michael Basham, deputy assistant Treasury secretary for federal
finance, said, ``We feel we have saved 10 to 12 basis points in
borrwing costs by issuing a 40-year bond instead of more 30-year
bonds.''
   The Treasury earlier said it had expected to save between eight
and 12 basis points over the comparable rate for 30-year bonds.
   Tuesday's bond sale brought to $29.5 billion the amount the
government has borrowed for S&amp;L rescues, with $20.5 billion left to
borrow through Sept. 30, 1991 to bring to $50 billion the total
contemplated in last year's bailout legislation.
   The government had not sold a 40-year bond since 1955.

   Expectations of a buildup in petroleum supplies
in the nation's storage tanks sent oil futures prices tumbling
Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Analysts said investors sold energy contracts ahead of the
American Petroleum Institute's weekly inventory report, which was
released after the close of trading.
   The report showed, as investors expected, increases in heating
oil and gasoline stocks. Crude oil supplies declined.
   In trading on the New York Merc, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the main grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 17 cents
to $21.60 per 42-gallon barrel. The April crude oil contract
declined 13 cents to $21.02 and May lost 12 cents to $20.63.
   Among refined products, heating oil for February delivery fell
1.71 cents to 59.28 cents a gallon, March declined 0.93 cent to
57.07 cents and April ended 0.32 cent lower at 55.18 cents a gallon.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for February delivery dropped 1.02
cents to 59.62 cents a gallon, while March lost 0.74 cent to 60.58
cents and April slipped 0.43 cent to 61.51 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said imports and continued strong refinery output in
the face of weakening demand contributed to the buildup in energy
inventories.
   ``Looks like a lack of demand for heating oil because of the
warmer weather,'' said Tom Bentz, director of futures trading for
United Energy Inc. ``On crude, it's imports and refinery runs.''
   According to the API, a trade association representing mainly
large oil refiners, gasoline stocks rose 4.6 million barrels in the
week ended Jan. 19 to 219.5 million barrels; heating oil stocks
rose 3.4 million barrels to 111.8 million; and crude oil declined 1
million barrels to 344 million.
   Most of the decrease in crude oil was from one geographic area,
while inventories in other regions rose, analysts said.

<HEAD>GE Fourth-Quarter Earnings Up 16 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co., bolstered by
strong sales in each of the company's key businesses, Tuesday
reported a 16 percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings.
   Net income for the quarter ended Dec. 31 was $1.17 billion, or
$1.30 per share, compared with $1.01 billion, or $1.12 per share,
for the same period a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter rose 5
percent to $16.2 billion from $15.5 billion a year earlier.
   Net earnings for the year were $3.94 billion, or $4.36 per
share, up 16 percent from $3.39 billion, or $3.75 per share, in
1988. Revenues were $54.6 billion, up from $50.1 billion in 1988.
   ``GE begins 1990 in excellent financial condition,'' said
Chairman John F. Welch Jr. ``Despite an unsettled global economic
outlook, we believe the company's good performance will continue
into 1990 and beyond.''
   GE has several core businesses, including plastics, aircraft
engines, home appliances and financial services. It also owns the
NBC television network and Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. Inc.
   GE said its broadcasting businesses had an unspecified increase
in profit, although NBC network suffered from lower comparative
revenue because it lacked a strong competitive counterpart to its
1988 Olympics broadcast.
   Net income in financial services, which includes Kidder, was up
18 percent from 1988 due to results from GE Capital Corp., the
company's financing business.
   Welch said aircraft engine orders totaled nearly $8 billion last
year, while firm orders in the aerospace division rose 8 percent to
$6 billion. Aerospace revenue was even with last year, while
aircraft revenue was up from 1988.
   New orders in the power generation unit rose more than 40
percent to $4 billion, while orders for medical systems rose more
than 20 percent. Industrial revenue were flat, but appliance
revenue and profit were up.

<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perkin-Elmer Corp., which has been trying
to sell its semiconductor equipment division for nine months, has
announced plans to cut 250 jobs within two weeks, most of them in
the semiconductor division.
   Perkin-Elmer spokesman Edward Bloch said Monday sagging sales
forced the layoffs, most of which will be at the company's optical
lithography unit in Wilton. He said the cuts will involve both
skilled and unskilled jobs.
   An industry analyst said the layoffs could indicate that
Perkin-Elmer is close to completing a deal to sell the
semiconductor unit.
   ``I suspect the company is starting to clear out the
infrastructure as part of a semiconductor sale,'' said L. Howard
Nichol, vice president of research at Hartford-based Advest Inc.
``This is not surprising, since the company announced it would
reduce employment last April.''
   Perkin-Elmer, based in Norwalk, makes measuring and analyzing
equipment for high-technology laboratories. The company cut about
300 jobs at its headquarters last April through attrition and
contract buyouts.
   Last fall, reports that Perkin-Elmer was considering selling the
semiconductor division to a Japanese firm sparked a debate over
U.S.-Japanese business relations and highlighted concerns that the
United States was falling behind Japan in computer technology.
International Business Machines Corp. publicly opposed such a sale.
   Nichols, however, said Advest now believes that Perkin-Elmer
will sell the semiconductor division to a coalition of domestic
computer-related firms.
   Bloch, the Perkin-Elmer spokesman, declined to comment on such
speculation.
   Bloch said all of the job cuts will be in Connecticut. After the
cuts, Perkin-Elmer will employ 2,200 people in Connecticut and
6,500 worldwide.
   The company has plants in New York, Minnesota and California,
and has plants and sales and service centers in England and West
Germany.

<HEAD>First Interstate Posts Big Loss Due to Southwest Real Estate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Interstate Bancorp said Monday that it
lost $344.3 million in the fourth quarter due to the previously
announced addition of $400 million in reserves against losses at
its Texas subsidiary.
   The loss for the October-December quarter, which works out to
$7.56 per share, left First Interstate with a yearly loss of $124.5
million, or $3.30 per share. It is due almost entirely to the
collapse of real estate prices in Texas and Arizona.
   First Interstate, the nation's 10th-largest banking concern with
$58 billion in assets, is struggling to put its losses behind. It
also took a $300 million charge this year because of problems with
loans in Arizona.
   In the fourth quarter of 1988, First Interstate earned $144
million, or $3.10 per share. Its profit for all of 1988 was $129
million, or $2.63 per share.
   Wall Street reacted favorably to the report, bidding up First
Interstate by 62{ cents per share to $44.62{ in trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   ``Theoretically, they are clearing the decks so they can make
some progress in 1990,'' said Dan Williams, a banking analyst with
Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco.
   First Interstate's losses contrast sharply with record profits
reported last week at big competitors like Los Angeles-based
Security Pacific and San Francisco-based Bank of America.
   By Williams' calculations, First Interstate owned $907 million
in real estate starting this year, compared to $498 million at the
beginning of 1989. The big increase shows just how much property
has been foreclosed.
   It also should provide First Interstate significant amounts of
new funds, Williams said, because with the big loss reserves, First
Interstate can afford to sell off the property more aggressively.
   ``They can move it out,'' he said. ``If they can liquidate a
significant part of that they can redeploy the funds.''
   First Interstate said last week that its longtime Chairman and
Chief Executive Joseph J. Pinola would be succeeded as operating
head of the company by President Edward Carson on June 1, after
Pinola's 65th birthday.
   In his 12 years as First Interstate's chief, Pinola aggressively
pursued interstate expansion _ a strategy that backfired in Texas
and Arizona.

   Hilton Hotels Corp. stock plunged
Tuesday on fears the company will be unable to find a buyer, and
Hilton said it would consider other alternatives to a sale at next
week's board meeting.
   The hotel-casino concern put itself on the auction block last
summer after settlement of a dispute over the estate of founder
Conrad Hilton. Hilton said it would entertain offers for all or
part of the company.
   Trading in Hilton stock was halted on the New York Stock
Exchange Tuesday after the share price fell $8 to $66.25. After
trading reopened, the stock sold at $64 per share, down $10.25 from
Monday's close. The stock closed at $65.50, down $8.75.
   The share price soared from $63 last May to $112 in August as
some analysts estimated shareholders might get between $120 and
$140 a share if Hilton was sold.
   Responding to queries from the stock exchange, Hilton issued a
statement Tuesday saying its board of directors would consider
several alternatives for the company at a regular board meeting
next week.
   Those include proposals to buy the company, as well as
restructurings that would not involve selling the company, Hilton
said.
   ``There can be no assurance that the company will elect to
pursue any of those alternatives,'' the statement added.
   JMB Realty Corp. of Chicago and Miller-Klutznick-Davis-Gray Co.,
billionaire investor Marvin Davis' Denver-based real estate
vehicle, had been among those interested in Hilton. The Wall Street
Journal reported Dec. 27 that they had made bids of about $90 a
share.
   Spokesmen for Davis and JMB declined to comment Tuesday on
Hilton.

<HEAD>Cray Profits Drop for Fourth Quarter, Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supercomputer maker Cray Research Inc. said
Tuesday its profits dropped 41 percent in the fourth quarter and 43
percent in 1989 because of the costs of product transitions and
development of its new Cray-3 computer.
   The results were roughtly in line with the company's earlier
projections.
   Cray's fourth-quarter profits fell to $52.5 million or $1.78 a
share from $88.53 million or $2.80 a share a year earlier. Revenues
for the quarter ended Dec. 31 were virtually unchanged at $330.1
million compared to $330.9 million.
   For the full year, Cray reported profits of $89 million or $3.02
a share, down from $156.6 million or $4.99 a share in 1988.
Revenues rose slightly to $784.7 million from $756.3 million.
   Customers accepted 35 computer systems with a contract value of
$300 million in the fourth quarter, bringing totals for the year to
73 systems worth $638 million, Cray said. That compares with 65
systems accepted in 1988 valued at $567 million.
   President Marcelo A. Gumucio, who initially predicted 10 percent
growth in revenue in 1989, said in July that revenue would likely
remain unchanged. He said contract signings had been delayed
because of competitive and economic conditions.
   ``Cray Research had a very strong fourth quarter in terms of
systems accepted, which helped us to meet the 1989 revenue and
earnings guidance we gave in October,'' said John Rollwagen, Cray's
chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``As expected, revenue was approximately the same as 1988
revenue and the decline in earnings from 1988 levels is due, in
large part, to product transition costs and CRAY-3 development
expense incurred during 1989.''
   Cray founder Seymour Cray left the company in May, spinning off
his development of the Cray-3, the first supercomputer to use
gallium arsenide semiconductors, into a separate company based in
Colorado Springs, Colo. The company was to start as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Cray Research and evolve within a year into a company
owned by existing Cray shareholders.
   Plans called for the new company to receive $100 million in
operating funds and $50 million in assets in the next two years
from Cray Research.
   Rollwagen predicted that revenue would remain essentially
unchanged in 1990 but added, ``we are confident that we can improve
profitability over 1989.''

<TEXT>
   The Federated and Allied department store
groups may get quick approval when they ask a U.S. Bankruptcy Court
judge Thursday for permission to continue paying employee benefits,
the U.S. trustee handling the case said Tuesday.
   The companies also hope for quick approval to use $700 million
in interim financing from New York banks.
   U.S. Trustee Conrad J. Morgenstern said in his view the requests
by Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. are
necessary in order to assure continued funding of benefits that the
companies' 100,000 employees nationwide are expecting.
   The benefits include health and education plans, disability
insurance, workers' compensation, bonus plans, assistance for
employees troubled by drug and alcohol abuse, and 401K retirement
plans funded by payroll deductions which serve a total of 44,461
Allied and Federated employees.
   Also among the benefits to be paid are merchandise discount
plans for 8,650 retirees who terminated employment with Allied or
Federated before the Chapter 11 filings. Those plans generate
additional sales for the companies, Morgenstern said.
   Morgenstern said he and his staff have been examining the
proposals to ensure they are appropriate and adequate.
   ``I think all of these requests are entirely appropriate and
necessary in order to have a company such as this, which is so
people-oriented, keep functioning at the high level of morale they
strive to achieve,'' Morgenstern said in a telephone interview from
his Cleveland office. ``Our office will not be in opposition to
those requests.''
   Federated and Allied, the American retailing divisions of the
Canadian company Campeau Corp., filed Chapter 11 reorganization
petitions Jan. 15 in Cincinnati to obtain court protection from
creditors. The Cincinnati-based retail companies listed $7.7
billion in debts.
   Under the Chapter 11 filing, the companies must obtain the
approval of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. for paying
operating expenses and other bills.
   Morgenstern's office is assigned to assist federal bankrupcy
courts in Ohio and Michigan. His staff is to attend Thursday
morning's hearing in Cincinnati before Aug, along with lawyers for
Federated, Allied and creditors.
   Federated and Allied also filed a motion Tuesday seeking Aug's
approval to use interim financing money from banks. New York's
Citibank is the chief source of Federated's $400 million in loans,
while Chemical Bank of New York is the major lender providing $300
million for Allied.
   Carol Sanger, a spokeswoman for Allied and Federated, said the
companies hope for quick approval. ``Most of this is housekeeping
stuff,'' Ms. Sanger said.
   ``It's customary for debtors, soon after they file under Chapter
11, to ask the court for authority to pay certain prepayment
claims,'' Morgenstern said.
   Morgenstern said he thinks Aug may give swift approval for the
employee benefits, but may take longer to approve the financing
requests.
   Aug has declined to be interviewed about the case, which
represents the largest Chapter 11 filing in American retailing
history. The parent Campeau Corp. and the retailers have been
struggling with debt accumulated when Campeau bought Allied in 1986
and Federated in 1988.

   Four Playmates and a bronze bunny greeted
visitors Tuesday to Playboy Enterprises Inc.'s new headquarters, a
gleaming corporate hutch that reflects the company's hopes for
rebounding profits.
   The new digs mark a slight departure in image for the publishing
and video company built on flesh and fantasy. Going into storage
with other icons of Playboy's racier past will be the Playboy sign
atop its former skyscraper headquarters on Michigan Avenue.
   In another sign of Playboy's times, founder Hugh Hefner skipped
the invitation-only headquarters housewarming party Tuesday night.
At 63, the onetime king of the swinging singles is working on his
autobiography and settled in his Los Angeles mansion with his
pregnant wife, former Playboy centerfold Kimberley Conrad.
   Hefner still owns about 70 percent of the company's stock but
daughter Christie Hefner, Playboy's chairman since November 1988,
runs the Chicago-based publishing and video company. She has run
Playboy's day-to-day operations since 1982, when she became
president.
   Playboy's new headquarters atop a 16-story downtown building
fronting Lake Michigan are smaller _ 100,000 square feet compared
with 125,000 in its old building _ but feature a two-story, skylit
atrium displaying valuable company-owned artworks and airier office
space.
   The new headquarters are less than three blocks from the
36-story tower that housed Playboy's corporate offices for 22
years. Playboy says the move will save the company $11 million over
the 15-year term of the lease.
   The smaller but airier new headquarters, Ms. Hefner said in a
telephone interview, ``make a symbolic statement about this company
being renewed, re-energized and entering another era of
creativity.''
   Playboy is indeed showing renewed vigor, 37 years after Hugh
Hefner launched the company's flesh-and-fashion flagship magazine
from his kitchen table in Chicago with a $600 investment.
   Although Playboy magazine's circulation is nowhere near its 1972
peak of 7.2 million, it has held at roughly 3.5 million for almost
five years while sales of harder-core men's magazines such as
Penthouse and Hustler have fallen.
   Under the direction of Ms. Hefner, 37, Playboy has made a
successful push into home video, retooled its broadcast television
operations, increased product licensing and expanded its publishing
business into art prints and catalogs.
   Ever watchful for new markets, the company moved quickly to
exploit the liberalization in Eastern Europe with a Hungarian
edition of Playboy magazine that sold out its 95,000-copy printing.
A second Hungarian issue is on the stands.
   The company blamed restructuring costs for a $3.8 million net
loss in the fiscal year ended June 30, which followed two
profitable years.
   Playboy reported a $5 million profit on revenue of $39.3 million
in the first quarter of its current fiscal year and some analysts
see growth in Playboy's future.
   ``They have an awful lot on their plate and the potential here
is quite significant,'' said analyst David Leibowitz of American
Securities Corp.
   Playboy is making the most of its 4,000-piece modern art
collection, selling some works and offering reprints of others,
including paintings that originally hung in its now-defunct U.S.
key clubs and Chicago mansion.
   Among the art on display in the new headquarters is a bronze
sculpture by Chicagoan Richard Hunt of Playboy's rabbit-head
trademark, a more discreet corporate welcome mat than the
nine-foot-high red neon letters spelling Playboy that still stand
atop the old headquarters building.
   Company spokeswoman Terri Tomcisin said the sign will come down
next month and go into storage along with other memorabilia from
Playboy's hedonistic past, including Hefner's round bed from the
Chicago Playboy mansion and a 10-foot replica of the Big Bunny, a
private DC-10 jetliner that once ferried his moving party between
Chicago and the West Coast.

<HEAD>Troubled Ferranti Sells Its Defense Arm To Britain's GEC
^Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with Customs probing rumors of
export violations; picks up 3rd graf, `Ferranti secured ...'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Ferranti International, the British defense
company hit by alleged fraud at a U.S. subsidiary, announced
Tuesday it is selling its main defense arm and its Italian
operations to Britain's General Electric Co. for $511.5 million.
   Shortly after the announcement, Britain's Customs and Excise
Department said it is probing rumors involving Ferranti that
controls on the export of military equipment had been infringed.
   A Customs, who declined to be named, gave no details of the kind
of equipment or the foreign countries rumored to be involved.
   Britain's Export of Goods (Control) Order requiring export
licences for goods with military uses is designed to prevent the
export of sensitive equipment to countries including the Soviet
Union, China and South Africa.
   The Financial Times, Britain's leading business newspaper,
quoted unidentified Ferranti officials as denying that any of the
company's exports had breached government rules.
   The paper said the investigation focused on whether goods
approved for export to friendly countries had been passed on to
users in another country, and whether descriptions of exports had
been accurate.
   Earlier Ferranti, which has urgently sought new cash after the
U.S. debacle, said GEC will buy the whole of the Scottish-based
Ferranti Defense Systems Group and part of the Italian subsidiary,
Ferranti Italia. GEC is not related to General Electric Co. of the
United States.
   Ferranti secured the deal two weeks before an emergency meeting
of shareholders was scheduled to vote on a rights issue _ a special
sale of shares to existing shareholders _ to try to raise $187.1
million to help cover the U.S. loss.
   The company said it now will postpone the Feb. 5 shareholders
meeting.
   Ferranti announced last September it discovered bogus contracts
following its acquisition of International Signal and Control Ltd.,
a U.S. defense company based in Lancaster, Pa. Ferranti is suing
James Guerin, former chairman of the U.S. company, and others for
$209.5 million in damages.
   Ferranti chairman Sir Derek Alun-Jones said the deal ``will
greatly strengthen the financial position of the group.'' Ferranti
is retaining three businesses _ computer software, a missile
operation and electronic products.
   ``The price we have agreed properly reflects the premium values
of Ferranti International's excellent operations in Scotland and
Italy,'' Alun-Jones added.
   The deal means that Ferranti's defense operations, which is a
major radar supplier for Britain's military, will remain under
British control. A possible bidder for the company was France's
Thomson CSF.
   However, the opposition Labor Party immediately demanded an
investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The party,
which has opposed the growing concentration of the country's
defense industry, noted that last year GEC and West Germany's
Seimens AG took over another former defense rival in Britain,
Plessey.
   The deal was announced after markets closed. Earlier, Ferranti
shares rose 8.25 cents to 56 cents on leaked news that Ferranti had
won a $3.3-billion order to supply the radar system for the
four-nation European Fighter Aircraft.
   ``The deal was not conditional on the order, but it obviously
made Ferranti more attractive to GEC,'' a Ferranti spokesman said.
   Ferranti Defense Systems, based in Edinburgh with 6,000
employees, accounts for about one-fourth of Ferranti's capital, but
nearly half its profits.
   The Edinburgh operation supplies navigation systems to the Royal
Air Force and has also become a major exporter of defense equipment.
   Ferranti Italia makes civil and military communications
equipment and electronics systems.
   Ferranti International announced this month it lost $24.75
million in the six months ended last September, compared with a
nearly $20 million profit in the same period in 1988.

   Alaska Airlines said Tuesday it will buy or lease
up to 64 McDonnell Douglas and Boeing jetliners worth $2.5 billion,
and that as part of the deal, a California leasing company will buy
into the carrier's holding company.
   International Lease Finance Corp. of Beverly Hills, which will
lease 24 Boeing 737-400s to the airline, will buy nearly all of a
$62.5 million new issue of Alaska Air Group Inc. convertible
preferred stock, said Bruce Kennedy, Alaska Air's chairman and
chief executive.
   Kennedy also announced a share repurchase program and formation
of an employee stock ownership plan.
   Industry analysts regarded the moves as insurance against a
takeover.
   ``We are pleased to have ILFC, a company whose principals we
have known and worked with for some nine years, as a major
shareholder,'' Kennedy said.
   The plan to purchase 20 MD90-30s from McDonnell Douglas with
options for another 20, and the lease of 24 Boeing jets ``means
that we have put together a plan to meet our aircraft requirements
for the next 10 years,'' Kennedy said.
   During the 1980s, Alaska Airlines grew from a tiny carrier that
served two states into an airline that now services Washington,
Alaska, California, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Arizona and
Mexico. Alaska Air Group also owns Horizon Air Industries, a
Pacific Northwest commuter airline.
   ILFC will buy the preferred stock issue for $59.4 million, while
about 1,200 Alaska Air Group management employees will be given the
opportunity to pay $3.1 million for the rights to convert the
preferred issue to common stock.
   ILFC will receive all the dividends payable on the preferred and
the shares' voting rights, equal to about 15 percent of the
company's total voting power.
   Kennedy said ILFC will be a passive investor and will not sit on
Alaska Air's board of directors.
   Alaska Air also will lend $20 million to set up the employee
stock ownership plan and its board has authorized the repurchase of
up to 3.5 million shares of common stock.
   William Whitlow Jr., an analyst with Dain Bosworth Inc. in
Seattle, said the arrangement appears to benefit all concerned.
   Alaska gets the aircraft and financing it needs and ``shark
repellent'' against a hostile takeover by putting a large portion
of its voting rights into friendly hands, Whitlow said. ILFC, in
turn, gets a large chunk of business with some protection on their
investment, he said.
   Kennedy said Alaska Airlines, which has grown fivefold in the
past decade, expects 1989 to be its 17th consecutive profitable
year.
   ``We're one of the few remaining specimens of an airline that
was born before deregulation which managed to tough it out against
the giants,'' he said.
   The twin-engine MD90-30s will carry 145 passengers each, with
the first plane to be delivered in 1994. The 737-400s, also
twin-engined planes, will carry 139 passengers in two classes.
   Both models are medium-range jets and will be outfitted with the
most quiet and fuel-efficient engines available, Kennedy said.
   ``The biggest factor probably driving us right now as we look
ahead through the 1990s is the noise issue, not only in Seattle but
the state of California,'' Kennedy said.
   In East Hartford, Conn., International Aero Engines said Alaska
Airlines had ordered $225 million worth of its new V2500 jet
engines to power the 20 MD90-30s, and had taken options on engines
for another 20 aircraft.
   IAE shareholders include United Techologies Corp., the parent of
East Hartford-based Pratt &amp; Whitney; Rolls-Royce of Great Britain;
Japanese Aero Engines Corp.; MTU of West Germany; and Fiat
Aviazione of Italy.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Introduces New Phone Message Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new telephone service allowing callers to leave
a recorded message and have it delivered automatically to any
number anytime within a week was introduced Monday by AT&amp;T.
   Under the service, callers dial a toll-free number, record a
message of up to one minute and code in when the message should be
delivered. The message is forwarded either through a regular phone
call or in an operator-assisted call, AT&amp;T said.
   The service, called VoiceMark Messaging Service, is available
across the country but is being marketed initially in the Atlanta
area, said AT&amp;T spokesman Bill Blair.
   Blair said VoiceMark was intended to make it easier for people
get through with messages even in the face of busy signals or empty
homes.
   ``You no longer have to endure the frustration and time delays
associated with a telephone that's busy, friends and associates who
aren't at home, or time zone differences,'' he said.
   The charge for a VoiceMark call is $1.75 for automated delivery
and $2.50 for person-to-person.
