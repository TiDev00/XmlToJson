   Republican gubernatorial nominee Clayton Williams,
who admitted during the weekend that he went to prostitutes as a
youth, said Monday it's time to put the past behind him and
concentrate on the issues in the campaign.
   ``I'm saying that I've not been a perfect man in my early days,
but I'm honest, I've admitted that and I'm willing to talk about
the issues now,'' Williams told reporters in Midland during an
appearance with his wife, Modesta.
   It was Williams' first public statement on the controversy
brought by a Sunday Houston Post story in which he admitted that he
frequented prostitutes in Mexico as a youth and later as a student
at Texas A&amp;M University.
   Mrs. Williams said Monday that the youthful escapades did not
bother her.
   ``That was so long ago, that was 35 or 40 years ago. That was
not part of our marriage. We've had a very strong, wonderful
marriage. What he did in his past, it doesn't matter to me.''
   Williams said he paid for sex in his youth because brothels
``were the only place you got serviced then.''
   He also has said he'd be uncomfortable running against a woman
because he grew up in a ``man's world.'' And, during gloomy weather
on a cattle roundup with reporters present, Williams compared rape
to bad weather, saying if it's inevitable, ``just relax and enjoy
it.''
   Williams' gaffes may be widening the gender gap in the Texas
governor's race, but political analysts say they won't necessarily
hurt the West Texas oilman's chances against Democratic state
Treasurer Ann Richards in November.
   ``It's definitely going to be a gender race and he's chiseling
away at the women's vote,'' said Karen Ashmore, a spokeswoman for
the Dallas chapters of the National Organization for Women. ``And I
think it'll be down to nothing by November.''
   But George Christian, an Austin political consultant, doesn't
think it's that clear.
   ``It's hard to say whether one or two incidents have a
devastating effect or not,'' said Christian, who was Lyndon
Johnson's White House press secretary. ``It's so far from the
general election _ God knows what's going to come out (by then), at
the rate it's going.
   ``I don't know who gets hurt and who gets helped ... I've never
seen politics this way. I don't know how to judge it,'' he said.
``I've never seen a man confess to what (Williams) confessed to the
other day.''
   Christian said Williams could undermine himself.
   ``He's accessible and he's honest, and we're going find out
whether that's refreshing or that's dangerous,'' he said.
   ``It may well be that people will act pretty positively to
someone who is naive and is totally open,'' said Max Sherman, dean
of the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University
of Texas at Austin.
   ``It seems to me that (Williams) probably is just a totally open
person ... He says what's on his mind, and he's continuing to do
that as a candidate,'' Sherman said. ``He doesn't try to hide the
ball.''
   But Ms. Ashmore said Williams' comments about prostitution were
his ``third strike.''
   ``It has clearly shown an underlying chauvinistic attitude
toward women. It shows insensitivity to women and to issues that
are of concern for women,'' she said.
   ``I think he's lost all the feminist vote, and a feminist is
anyone who believes in equality for women,'' Ms. Ashmore said. ``I
also think he's losing more of the mainstream Republican women who
were willing to give him a chance.''

   Call it ``Ice Cream Wars.''
   Instead of race, politics and patronage, the issues were
chocolate, strawberry and vanilla in a series of ice cream
commercials that feature five Chicago aldermen bickering over their
favorite flavors.
   The ads that debuted Monday for Edy's Grand Ice Cream are a
spoof on the city's Council Wars, the political sparring that
erupted in the City Council after the 1983 election of the city's
first black mayor, Harold Washington.
   It's part of the company's effort to boost sales in the Chicago
area by capitalizing on the public's fascination with politics,
Chicago-style.
   The Oakland, Calif., ice cream maker's campaign features three
30-second TV commercials.
   ``Order, please,'' commands the chamber speaker (an actor) as
the aldermen argue. ``Yeah, order more vanilla,'' responds Alderman
Roman Pucinski.
   Alderman Edward Burke prefers blueberry, colleague Luis
Gutierrez opts for strawberry, Lawrence Bloom can't decide between
chocolate and vanilla, and Danny Davis likes peach.
   ``Will the alderman yield?'' Gutierrez asks. ``Not until I'm
finished,'' an ice cream-savoring Davis responds in the ad.
   If truth be told, Davis said he had never tasted the product
before the ads, and may not afterward.
   ``I love ice cream,'' the stout alderman said with a chuckle.
``But I have to be careful.''

   Who says dead men don't tell tales?
   Sam Feigenbaum had many choice words for federal bureaucrats
after an error listed him as deceased and cut off Medicare and
Social Security benefits.
   Feigenbaum, 71, said he learned he was listed in Social Security
Administration computers as dead when he applied for $2,860 in
Medicare payments for hospital tests in February. Also, American
Savings was ordered to return about $2,500 in Social Security
benefits deposited in his account between July and February, he
said.
   ``I begged the director of the bank, `Don't send the money away.
I am not dead,''' he said.
   The confusion apparently stems from the death of Feigenbaum's
wife, Sara, in July. They shared the same first initial, and
Feigenbaum's Medicare claim number was identical except for the
letter ``A'' at the end.
   More than $700 has been returned to his bank account, but it
will take longer to make the correction in the main Social Security
computer banks to pay doctor and hospital bills, said Social
Security branch manager Mark Spicker.
   Last week, Feigenbaum said he received another letter from
Medicare saying it will not pay his hospital bills.
   ``It's cheaper to send someone to check whether I'm alive than
to send so many letters,'' he said.

   Jimmy Stewart was honored Monday night for his
wonderful life in film _ a career that's spanned more than 50 years
and brought the lanky actor with the gentle drawl two Academy
Awards.
   ``I'm just grateful to you all,'' Stewart said after the Film
Society of Lincoln Center presented its ``Tribute to James
Stewart.''
   ``It's so much more than I ever dreamed of,'' said the
81-year-old Stewart. ``I ask God to bless all of you. And when he
takes your lives into his editing room, I pray that he will be as
kind to each of you as you've been to me tonight.''
   George C. Scott, Dorothy Lamour, Maureen O'Hara, Janet Leigh,
Robert Stack, June Allyson, Jack Lemmon, and Kim Novak offered
reverential speeches and affectionate anecdotes about their times
with Stewart.
   Scott said Stewart had the gift of making his roles unique.
   ``Can you imagine me, for instance, with a trombone, trying to
convince somebody I was Glenn Miller?'' Scott asked. ``Not only
have you filled our hearts but you've uplifted our spirits and
you've nourished our souls.''
   The tribute at Avery Fisher Hall included clips from 23 of
Stewart's films in which he sang, confessed to murder, talked to an
invisible rabbit, kissed women and fought men.
   Lamour recalled the night Stewart's wife, Gloria, had twins
almost 40 years ago during the shooting of ``The Greatest Show on
Earth.'' ``He was so nervous,'' Lamour said, ``he even talked
fast.''
   Stack said he once hid behind scenery during filming of ``The
Mortal Storm'' to watch Stewart act, thinking, ``I'm never going to
be able to do it like that,'' adding, ``I was right. I never have
been able.''
   Stack said, ``He goes right through the lens of the camera into
people's hearts. This could only happen with somebody like Jimmy
who is what you see. There is no fake. He's a wonderful actor,
consummate gentleman, outstanding husband, citizen, patriot, war
hero.''
   ``He became the inspiration I needed in my fear of the dizzying
road to stardom,'' said Miss Novack, his costar in ``Vertigo.''
``He seemed to be one of God's tall sheltering redwood trees in the
midst of a make-believe forest. He's always been my favorite
leading man.''
   ``I think he has come way beyond just entertaining us,'' Lemmon
offered. ``He has touched us, exposed us, made us think,
enlightened us.''
   Stewart began his career with MGM studios in 1935 with a film
called ``Murder Man.'' He's appeared in more than 70 films and won
an Academy Award for ``The Philadelphia Story,'' and an honorary
Oscar in 1985.

   Smiling children skip along dirt
paths, kicking up radioactive dust. They throw stones in their
radioactive playground, then go home for contaminated meat and milk.
   Since cesium, strontium and plutonium descended on their
rooftops, gardens, farms and schools four years ago, the people of
this Byelorussian village and of scores more in the Ukraine and
Russia have been prisoners of Chernobyl.
   They are surrounded and continously bombarded by an enemy they
cannot see, smell or hear. They say their government and the world
have all but forgotten them.
   In Bartolomeyevka, another village, a warm and hearty woman
named Tatiana T. Kharshunova said: ``They did this to us, and we
had to live here. Not just for a month or two but four years. No
one paid attention to us.''
   She and her neighbors grow potatoes and barley in their gardens,
even though the radiation level is 40 curies, nearly three times
the danger level. They can recite the figures like scientists, but
do not seem fully aware of the threat.
   ``I'm as strong as a horse,'' Irina Y. Kovoleva said. She looked
down at her 14-month-old grandson in her arms and added: ``He's
strong, too.''
   The boy and his parents were scheduled to be evacuated the next
day.
   ``I'll cry when they leave,'' the grandmother said. ``The
cemetery is nearby, so I'll die and go there.''
   Nadezhda N. Dmitrochenko of the local governing council said she
tries to explain the dangers of radiation, but ``people still don't
know what this is. ... It doesn't glow and it doesn't whistle.''
   On April 26, 1986, an explosion and fire destroyed one of four
reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Ukraine, 125
miles southwest of Noviye Gromyki.
   As the children of the village played on a sunny April day four
years later, chickens and cats darted among the green and brown
wooden huts.
   The only sounds were chickens clucking, dogs barking and the
distant roar of tractors plowing contaminated fields in the vast,
fertile plain traversed by a creek.
   The official death toll from Chernobyl remains at 31, but a
Soviet newspaper said last fall it had risen to 250. Scientists
still predict thousands of deaths will be traceable to the accident.
   After years of passivity, the people affected are speaking out.
   Residents of Gomel, the provincial capital, plan a strike and
demonstration Thursday, the anniversary, to protest official
handling of what the government newspaper Izvestia called ``the
greatest technological catastrophe'' in world history.
   Citizens of Kiev, the Ukrainian capital 80 miles south of
Chernobyl, also plan demonstratons. A telethon to raise money for
victims is scheduled in Moscow.
   Protesters demand that officials who concealed the extent of the
danger and delayed evacuating contaminated areas be brought to
trial. They want medical care for victims and supplies of
radiation-free food.
   About 70 percent of the Chernobyl radiation fell on Byelorussia
and contaminated one-fifth of the arable land, an area twice the
size of Massachusetts, where 2.2 million people live.
   Immediately after the accident, about 25,000 Byelorussians were
evacuated, but only last year did officials admit the full scope of
the contamination and decide to resettle more than 100,000 more.
The resettlement will take five years, and people eat and breathe
nuclear poison in the meantime.
   The program appears poorly run. Some evacuees are being
resettled on land that also is contaminated and the government is
building new homes, schools and offices in areas that are being
evacuated.
   Most families with young children have been moved out of Noviye
Gromyki since resettlement began Jan. 1.
   Those still waiting feel abandoned and frightened. They cannot
move on their own because housing must be found for them.
   ``We sit and cry,'' said Claudia A. Kostochka, 75, who was on a
bench with two other women, sobbing. ``They won't take us. We're
pensioners.''
   ``I lived almost a whole century here, raised a son and daughter
here. Two weeks ago they closed our store, so we're eating cabbage
and cucumber preserves from last year. We don't know whether it's
dangerous or not, but we have to eat.''
   A farmer said the milk from his cows was too radioactive to
drink, so he sells it to the government, which makes it into
butter. He said the butter was supposed to be safe.
   Many others interviewed said they drank the milk because there
was no alternative. As many more said they did not bother to have
their home produce checked at a local radiation laboratory.
   Soil and dust carry radioactive particles.
   The only paved surfaces in Noviye Gromyki are one street and the
grade school playground at No. 13 Lenin Street. Winds blow dust
from the dirt roads and fields onto the asphalt and the people, and
into their homes.
   Residents are warned not to gather firewood from the highly
radioactive forests nearby. Burning it makes their stoves into what
specialists have called ``mini-reactors.''
   Villagers are supposed to wash frequently, but they are allowed
only one bar of soap a month, the same as anyone else. Soap is
rationed in most of the country.
   Each household gets 30 rubles a month from the government to buy
uncontaminated food, but it is hard to find. Thirty rubles are
worth $49 at the official exchange rate, but much less in reality.
   In Vetka, a few miles south of Novoyi Gromyki, children are fed
``clean'' meals at High School No. 1 and the crumbling cement
floors are washed several times a day.
   Outside, their protection against radiation consists of paved
playground and a 6-inch-high concrete barrier to keep them off the
sidewalk where contaminated dirt falls from the roof. Students are
supposed to rinse their shoes in a pan of water at the school
entrance, but many don't.
   Several students said they ignored warnings and rode mopeds in
the forest. They complained of headaches and exhaustion, which they
blamed on fallout.
   To the list of ailments the Chernobyl generation suffers, school
principal Nikolai N. Shatilo added bloody noses, swollen thyroid
glands and vision loss. The radiation level at High School No. 1 is
two to three times normal.
   ``We can't provide normal conditions in school,'' he said.
``There's only one thing to do: take them to a clean zone. We must
save the children. They are our future.''
   One student said she was bitter because no one seemed to care,
not even the doctors who examine her class twice a year.
   A 16-year-old boy said: ``We're sick and tired of all the
checkups. What are they for? All they do is keep saying
everything's normal.''

   Dean Kahler hugged the grass of the practice
football field. Bullets were ricocheting off the blacktop road no
more than 40 feet away.
   ``Oh, my God! They're firing,'' he said to himself.
   Then a sudden sting, not much more than a pin prick at his back.
It was the only pain he felt. He would never walk again.
   A bullet fired through Jeffrey Miller's mouth and skull slammed
him to the ground. As his blood pooled along a concrete curb, a
14-year-old runaway knelt over him in anguish, her arms flung
skyward, her face contorted in bewildered terror.
   A 13-second fusillade by National Guardsmen turned anti-war
dissent into disaster on a May Monday 20 years ago at Kent State
University.
   Four students were killed and nine others wounded, stunning a
nation already fragmented by five years of a distant conflict.
   By April 1970, more than 100 young Americans and probably
thousands of Vietnamese, north and south, were dying each week in
distant jungles and rice paddies. But now the war had claimed
victims at home, four kids on a blue-collar campus amid the
pancake-flat farmfields of Ohio.
   (Even so, a Gallup poll taken for Newsweek within days of the
shootings indicated that 58 percent of the public blamed the
demonstrators and backed the Ohio guardsmen. The mourning parents
received hate mail.)
   Almost three more years would pass before the United States
ended its military role in Vietnam, although some families of the
dead believe the Kent State killings hastened that end.
   ``I believe the war in Vietnam was brought to a quicker close
because of it,'' said Florence Schroeder of Lorain, Ohio, whose
19-year-old son, William, died that day. ``That is our only reason
to have ever filed the lawsuits, to make sure the event gets its
proper historical significance.''
   The significance of dead students on American soil was powerful.
Dissent against U.S. involvement in Vietnam had built slowly since
combat troops were sent in March 1965. But by 1970, campuses were
in turmoil over the increasingly unpopular war.
   President Richard Nixon was seen as the villain and he returned
the sentiment in kind. The president assailed the more vocal
anti-war protesters as ``bums.'' His vice president, Spiro Agnew,
suggested in April that universities deal with their protesters
like Nazis: ``The next time a mob of students, waving their
non-negotiable demands, starts pitching bricks and rocks at the
student union _ just imagine they are wearing brown shirts or white
sheets and act accordingly.''
   Adding to the boiling tension was the fact that every young
man's birthday was potentially a ticket to Vietnam. From 1969 to
1973, the military draft was a lottery based on birth dates.
   ``The black cloud of Vietnam and the draft were hanging over
their heads,'' said Kahler, then a 20-year-old freshman and
conscientious objector from Canton, Ohio.
   Thomas Lough was one of many professors who felt they didn't
dare give a male student a failing grade. ``That would kill him,''
said Lough, who teaches sociology at Kent State. ``They'd be
eligible for selective service if they were flunked out of school.
Their lives were on the line.''
   On April 30, student dissenters around the country listened in
disbelief as Nixon announced on nationwide television the invasion
of neutral Cambodia by U.S. troops bent on destroying communist
border sanctuaries.
   Just the previous July, Nixon had begun a phased withdrawal, and
tens of thousands of American men were already back home. Now
Americans were fighting on a new front. Some students had lost
brothers and childhood friends in the war. They didn't want to kill
or to be killed. Protests broke out at one-third of the nation's
2,500 colleges.
   The day after Nixon's speech, perhaps 500 anti-war protesters
rallied peacefully at noon on the Kent State commons, then planned
to gather again Monday.
   But that night, the first warm evening of the year, a small
crowd of students and townies spilled from a string of bars in
downtown Kent. Early festiveness turned to angry shouts and
anti-war slogans. A passing police cruiser dodged beer bottles.
   The crowd, by midnight swollen to 500 people, lit a bonfire in
the street and began smashing shop windows.
   The mayor declared a civil emergency, imposed a curfew, closed
the bars and summoned the National Guard. Thrown rocks slightly
injured four or five officers. Police forced the students back onto
campus with tear gas.
   The violence continued. On Saturday night, the campus ROTC
building was burned down. Demonstrators threw rocks at firefighters
and slashed their hoses. The arsonists were never identified or
arrested.
   The National Guard arrived in the midst of the chaos. One convoy
was stoned as it approached the campus. The guardsmen were already
weary, pulled away from patrolling interstate highways during a
truckers' strike.
   When they were called out again to patrol Monday morning,
``nobody had any sleep to amount to anything,'' recalled Sgt. Leon
Smith of Beach City, Ohio.
   That same morning, Alan Canfora, a 21-year-old junior from
Barberton, Ohio, left for the noon rally carrying a black flag, his
banner of mourning for yet another Vietnam casualty.
   Even before the Cambodia invasion, more Americans were dying
every day. The toll was grim: 335 killed in January, 385 in
February, 442 in March. One of the April victims was Canfora's
childhood friend.
   Canfora, upset at his friend's death and by the presence of the
guardsmen on campus, joined 200 to 300 student protesters gathered
at the commons. As other students left class for lunch, the crowd
grew to as many as 2,000, many of them on the hill behind the main
knot of demonstrators.
   Many of the dissenters talked angrily about the guardsmen, the
curfew and the university's ban on rallies, announced the day
before. They considered the last an attack on their rights to free
speech and assembly.
   ``I felt so strongly against the war,'' Canfora said in an
interview. ``I was willing to risk my own life and face those
rifles. I chose the black flag because of the sad state of affairs
on our campus and in our country.''
   To enforce the ban on rallies, guardsmen drove past in a jeep,
ordering students through a bullhorn to leave the commons.
   ``Pigs off campus!'' the students shouted.
   ``Sieg Heil!'' they chanted, mocking the Nazi salute.
   Students hurled stones at the jeep, and guardsmen retaliated
with a burst of tear gas canisters. The students tossed them back.
   Within moments, however, the nearly 100 guardsmen had fixed
their bayonets and loaded their weapons, mostly M-1 rifles. They
advanced on the students, scattering them in retreat over the hill
and down the other side onto the football field and parking lot.

   As the students retreated, Allison Krause, a freshman honors
student from Pittsburgh who had just turned 19, turned to her
boyfriend and sobbed, ``Why are they doing this to us? Why don't
they let us be?'' She cursed the soldiers and threw rocks.
   The guardsmen regrouped on the practice field, knelt and aimed
their rifles at students in the parking lot. But other students had
regrouped behind them. Realizing they were outflanked, the
guardsmen rose and marched back up the hill to resume their
original position on the commons.
   They were under bombardment from stones and obscenities, but the
nearest students were at least 60 feet away. As the guardsmen
neared the top of the hill, they suddenly turned, rifles at their
shoulders.
   The gunfire stunned the students. Many began running. Others
dropped to the ground. Some, thinking the guardsmen were firing
blanks, stood their ground _ until they heard the bullets hitting
around them.
   Joseph Lewis Jr., an 18-year-old freshman from Massillon, Ohio,
and probably closest to the guardsmen, was shot as he made an
obscene gesture. A guardsman later said he believed Lewis was
advancing on him. Lewis was hit just below the waist and slammed to
the ground.
   ``I felt like being hit in the stomach with a shovel,'' he said.
``I thought I was dying. I prayed.'' Another bullet hit his left
leg.
   Canfora, about 75 yards away, was shot in the right wrist. ``I
got behind a tree. That's what saved my life,'' he said. ``I'm
convinced they were shooting at me intentionally. I could hear
bullets hitting the tree. I could hear bullets zipping and cracking
through the air and through the grass on both sides of the tree.''
   Sixty-one shots were fired from at least 28 weapons.
   Allison Krause fell mortally wounded 100 yards away from the
guardsmen, a bullet through her chest. The body of 20-year-old Jeff
Miller of Plainview, N.Y., dropped 90 yards from the rifles.
   The FBI said Krause and Miller were initially at the front of
the crowd taunting the guardsmen. Miller made some offensive
gestures and Miss Krause shouted obscenities, the report said, but
``neither was in a position to pose even a remote danger to the
National Guard at the time of the firing.''
   Sandy Scheuer, 20, of Boardman, Ohio, and Schroeder were walking
to class. Each was about 130 yards from the guardsmen. Schroeder
was shot in the back after diving to the ground. Scheuer was shot
through the neck.
   ``I was scared,'' said Sgt. Smith, who fired one shot into the
air. ``I felt my life was in danger. I had a fellow coming at me
with what looked like a brick in his hand. I had no intention of
hurting anybody or killing anybody.''
   What prompted the shootings remains a mystery. The FBI said it
could only speculate. One theory is that a guardsman either fired
in panic or shot intentionally at a student, and the other
guardsmen fired at the sound of the first shot.
   The President's Commission on Campus Unrest said that although
the actions of some students were violent, criminal, dangerous,
reckless and irresponsible, ``the indiscriminate firing of rifles
into a crowd of students and the deaths that followed were
unnecessary, unwarranted and inexcusable.''
   A Portage County special grand jury found that the guardsmen
acted in self-defense and exonerated them of criminal charges. It
indicted 25 students and faculty members including Canfora, Lewis
and Lough, the professor. Those charges were dropped in December
1971.
   In March 1974, a federal grand jury in Cleveland indicted eight
guardsmen on charges of violating the civil rights of the dead and
wounded students. Midway through the trial, a judge dropped all
charges for lack of evidence.
   The wounded students and the families of the dead settled a $40
million civil suit out of court in January 1979 for $675,000. But
more important to them, they said, was a signed acknowledgment by
the defendants, Gov. James A. Rhodes and 27 guardsmen, that the
shootings should not have occurred and that the confrontation could
have been resolved in other ways.
   After years of debate over an appropriate memorial, a granite
plaza with four prominent upright slabs is being dedicated May 4 on
a 2{-acre site adjacent to the parking lot where the students were
killed.
   A bouquet of 58,175 gold daffodils already blooms around the
memorial, one for each American man and woman killed in Vietnam.
   For Florence Schroeder, the daffodils are a living memorial more
valuable than quarried granite. Her son, she explains, used to pick
her wild flowers when he was a schoolboy. She says she will plant
one more daffodil at the memorial.
   For him.

   June Romeo is back at Kent State, a generation
after witnessing National Guard bullets kill four students and
wound nine more. The tears still come easily.
   ``It's funny,'' the 38-year-old nursing instructor and graduate
student said. ``They said 13 seconds (of gunfire). When you stop to
think: one, two, three, four ... If you count, that's a long time.''
   Romeo, then an 18-year-old freshman from Westlake, Ohio, was
about 20 steps from one of the wounded, Tom Grace. ``You don't
believe it at first,'' she said. ``No one had ever shot a student
protester before.''
   The violence and its emotion-charged aftermath became too much
for Romeo. She left campus the next year, upset by such scenes as a
cafeteria confrontation between students joking about the shootings
and others who were irate.
   ``It was not the right place for me,'' said Romeo, who tried
selling insurance then enrolled at Baldwin-Wallace College, a small
liberal arts school in Berea, near her hometown.
   ``I kept thinking, `I should go back,' but I never did,'' said
Romeo, who keeps a candle from the first campus anniversary
memorial May 4, 1971. Twenty years later, she has come back, as a
graduate student and instructor in educational theory.
   ``The tragedy was very personal,'' said Romeo, whose
undergraduate students occasionally note her resemblance to the
young woman whose searing photographic image, arms raised high over
a dying Kent State student, won a Pulitzer Prize.
   Romeo said she pushed the shootings out of her mind, along with
other campus memories. She lost track of classmates and roommates.
She collected _ but never read _ almost every book about the
shootings and student unrest in 1970.
   ``I wanted things connected with it,'' she said of the books.
Her husband has read the books, but the two don't talk about ``May
4.''
   Romeo says the only person with whom she discussed Kent State in
detail was a physician and former Navy officer who convinced her
that the guardsmen would never have fired without a command.
   ``That more than anything else has bothered me. ... I can't
conceive of a mind that would give an order like that,'' she said,
pausing to catch her breath at the thought.
   Romeo's emotions were rekindled four years ago when James
Rhodes, who as Ohio governor had ordered the National Guard onto
the Kent State campus to restore order, was a patient at the
Cleveland Clinic, where Romeo was a nurse.
   The soft-spoken Romeo said her loathing for Rhodes and his role
in what happened was so strong that she took a day or two off while
Rhodes was hospitalized.
   ``I kept thinking, `I want so much for him to feel some of the
terror those people felt,''' she said. ``That really brought it
back. I never had feelings like that about anyone. I really can't
think of people I hate.''
   Romeo returned to Kent State full-time last year. She credits
her social activism for her return to campus and her efforts to
deal with memories of the shootings. She runs a program in
Cleveland's inner city that teaches youngsters to read and write as
well as how to make reasoned decisions that will affect their lives.
   ``I need to help people become aware,'' she said. ``Aware of
choices and consequences.''
   Romeo believes that few among the couple thousand Kent State
students protesting the war on May 4, 1970 were aware of the
potential consequences. She teaches her students that ``you're
going to have to decide for yourselves what battles are important
to fight and what aren't worth your time and effort.''
   When her students learn she was a student of the '70s, they are
curious about the period. She tells them she favored ``weird
clothes'' and wore her hair long and flowing.
   ``I even wore flowers in my hair,'' she tells them. ``They said,
`Noooo.'''
   Romeo brushes aside the current campus brouhaha over whether the
granite memorial to be dedicated on the 20th anniversary of the
shootings is too little, too late.
   ``I don't care that much about the memorial,'' she said. ``I
think the most fitting thing is to keep the whole thing alive.
People 20 years down the line should really be questioning it. It
should be studied _ like we study wars.''

   Did we all descend from Eve, an African woman
whose offspring quite literally conquered the world?
   Though of course no one knows her name, some biologists and
anthropologists believe that all humanity traces its roots to just
one woman. This idea, known as the Eve hypothesis or the Garden of
Eden theory, is intriguingly simple:
   Eve lived in sub-Saharan Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. As
the ancestors of modern humans, her children and grandchildren
spread throughout Africa and eventually across the world,
triggering the extinction of other primitive peoples.
   Or so some scientists believe.
   Others ridicule the idea. The theory, based on a comparison of
the genes of people around the world, is one of the most hotly
contested controversies in the often-rancorous field of human
origins.
   At a meeting earlier this year of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science, both sides argued their cases with
facts, speculation and sarcasm.
   Allan C. Wilson of the University of California at Berkeley, one
of the architects of the Eve hypothesis, said the evidence is so
strong that the ``argument is done, clinched, finished. It's over.''
   Not quite, countered the other side.
   ``There are serious and obvious flaws in the Eve hypothesis,''
said Geoffrey G. Pope of the University of Illinois.
   Most everyone agrees that small-brained, humanlike creatures
arose in Africa 1.5 million to 2 million years ago. They spread
throughout Africa, Europe and Southeast Asia and flourished for
hundreds of thousands of years.
   But what became of them? The theory favored by Pope and many
fossil experts holds that those creatures, known as homo erectus,
are the true ancestors of us all.
   If they are right, these early hominids parted company in Africa
but went on to evolve in unison. Useful genetic changes that arose
in small pockets of population slowly spread throughout the world
as neighboring tribes mingled. After thousands of centuries, they
became us _ modern humans who differ only in superficial racial
features.
   However, Garden of Eden theorists believe those early settlers
disappeared leaving no trace in humanity's genes. Instead, they say
they have evidence that a new kind of people arose in Africa much
more recently. Their kin also spread throughout the prehistoric
world, somehow killing off or squeezing out the European
Neanderthals and other descendants of the first wave out of Africa.
   The difference between the scenarios is so stark that there
seems to be no middle ground, no room for compromise.
   ``There is no question on this issue,'' said Alan G. Thorne of
the Australian National University, an Eve skeptic. ``One of us is
absolutely wrong.''
   The debate began about three years ago with the use of new
scientific techniques to look for signs of the family tree inside
the genes of modern humans. This intrusion of the glitzy tools of
molecular biology have not always been accepted graciously by the
traditional fossil hunters, who rely largely on meticulous
measurements and comparisons of bone fragments to fathom human
origins.
   David W. Frayer, a Neanderthal expert from the University of
Kansas, said the quick acceptance of Eve reflects a preference for
sensational catastrophe over mundane gradual change, as well as a
``willingness of some to accept without criticism, or even
suspicion, the results of molecular biology.''
   Molecular biology's role has been to decipher the genetic
information inside mitochondria. These are structures within human
cells that help produce energy.
   Mitochondria have their own genes, separate from the chromosomes
that carry all the other blueprints for human beings. Ordinary
genes are a mishmash contributed equally by mothers and fathers.
Mitochondrial genes are passed along only by mothers.
   Therefore, each new generation gets an almost exact copy of the
mitochondrial genes of their forebears. The only difference is the
occasional variation caused by genetic mutations.
   These mutations are the key to reading mitochondrial genes as a
clock. Biologists believe they know how quickly the mutations
occur. By comparing the degree of mutation in the genes of people
from different parts of the world, they believe they can trace the
various lines back to the point at which they all converge: Eve.
   The latest study of this sort, conducted by Linda Vigilant at
Berkeley, uses hair roots plucked from 199 people from Europe,
Asia, New Guinea and seven ethnic groups in Africa. Analyzing the
root genes, she calculates all the people descended from a common
ancestor who lived in Africa 207,000 years ago. This female's
descendants evolved into physically modern humans by 100,000 years
ago.
   As neat as the idea seems, anthropologists attack it on several
grounds.
   One is whether the mutations in mitochondrial genes occur like
clockwork. The critics argue that the biologists are overly
confident that they know the tempo at which the mitochondrial clock
is ticking.
   Milford H. Wolpoff of the University of Michigan contends the
clock's rhythm is hopelessly thrown off by the dead ends of all-boy
families. Whenever a family produces no girls, the orderly
accumulation of genetic mutations stops cold. No mitochondrial
genes are passed to the next generation.
   ``If there is a clock,'' said Thorne, ``it needs new batteries.''
   Other scientists point to the fossil record, the teeth and bits
of bone that remain from the ancient beings.
   If the Eve theory is correct, the new wave of humans migrating
out of Africa 1,000 centuries ago did not mate and mingle their
genes with the ancient hominids that already lived in Europe and
Asia. Instead, they replaced them completely.
   Some fossil experts believe they have found clear signs that
traits of those ancient peoples have been passed down to modern
humans. For instance, Pope argues that 1 million-year-old fossils
from ancient Asia have the same cheekbones and wisdom teeth as
modern Asians.
   This similarity in facial features ``indicates that the Eve
hypothesis is completely untenable in Asia.''
   Frayer also believes he can see echoes of Neanderthal skulls and
teeth in later generations of Europeans.
   Allison S. Brooks of George Washington University questions Eve
on behavioral grounds. She said that if modern humans overran
Europe, replacing the dimwitted natives, there should also have
been a cultural revolution.
   However, she finds no abrupt change showing dramatically more
advanced stone tools or hunting techniques in Europe after the
supposed arrival of Eve's offspring.

   After 100 days in office, Gov. L. Douglas
Wilder has earned widespread attention for his ``New Mainstream''
agenda but criticism at home from some who say he has ignored black
concerns and has little vision for Virginia.
   Wilder gets about 250 invitations a week to speak on his
platform of fiscal conservatism and social progressivism that he
says helped make him the nation's first elected black governor.
   ``It's really caught on around the country _ the New
Mainstream,'' he said in an interview last week, shortly before he
reached his 100th day in office Sunday.
   Although he says national office isn't on his agenda, Wilder has
traveled twice to California and will speak at a Democratic
political event in New Hampshire in June. Both states will hold
early presidential primaries in 1992.
   ``I haven't really taken any time from state activities to go to
any other place,'' he said.
   Wilder's message has worried some black political scientists who
say he has neglected black issues in an attempt to appeal to white
voters.
   They point to his push to expand the death penalty in Virginia,
his opposition to creating a majority black congressional district
in the state and his refusal to take a stand on whether women
should be admitted to tax-supported Virginia Military Institute.
   ``I think the reluctance to take a stronger stand on the VMI
issue is particularly troubling,'' said Charles E. Jones, an
associate professor of political science at Old Dominion University
in Norfolk. ``If we don't have black politicians taking a more
aggressive stand on that, then who is?''
   ``If Doug Wilder's agenda is just going to be politics as usual,
then I don't think there's that much for blacks to be excited
about,'' said Georgia Persons, associate professor of political
science at Georgia Tech University.
   Wilder said his priorities _ fighting the drug problem,
eliminating disparity among local school systems and improving
early childhood education _ will benefit blacks as well as whites.
   ``Blacks are disproportionately affected,'' he said. ``I'm not
unaware of it.''
   The state NAACP has refused to criticize Wilder even though it
disagrees with him on the death penalty and redistricting.
   ``I said from the beginning that Doug Wilder was not going to be
a black panacea governor,'' said Jack W. Gravely, president of the
state branch of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
   ``If he did not do what he's doing now, the press would label
him a wild-eyed Jesse Jackson,'' Gravely said.
   Wilder has been popular nationally because he is positioning
himself as an alternative to Jackson, who represents the Democratic
Party's liberal wing, said Robert Holsworth, a political analyst at
Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. But Wilder has yet to
prove himself in the governor's mansion, Holsworth said.
   ``We've yet to see many substantive initiatives put forward by
the governor,'' he said. ``He's been much more successful in
flexing his political muscles and gaining national attention than
he has been in developing a clear agenda for Virginia.''
   State Sen. Joseph V. Gartlan Jr. of Fairfax, one of the few
Democrats willing to criticize the governor publicly, said he is
still waiting for Wilder to explain his pledge to help youth and
families and his vision for the state.
   ``He really hasn't filled that void yet,'' Gartlan said.
   In speeches out of state, Wilder boasted about balancing the
state budget without mentioning that it is required by state law,
and called his $200 million budget reserve a ``rainy day'' fund
even though it is designated for teacher raises in 1991, Gartlan
said.
   ``It's something of a triumph of form over substance,'' he said.
   Gartlan also said Wilder's handling of several political
appointments ``left a very bad taste in a lot of people's mouths.''
   Wilder replaced some close associates of former Democratic Gov.
Gerald L. Baliles on boards and commissions with his own supporters
and caused a minor flap when he delayed approving low-numbered
license plates that Baliles had requested for his former aides.
   ``One would almost think that he was a Republican governor in
terms of Wilder's treatment of him,'' Holsworth said of Baliles,
who has declined to comment on Wilder.
   Holsworth said Wilder's rough treatment of fellow Democrats
could backfire when he needs their support later, but the governor
said he is not concerned.
   ``In politics, people need each other,'' he said.
   Wilder also disputed the notion that Democrats in the General
Assembly are dissatisfied with him.
   ``If that were the case, they wouldn't be supporting me as they
do,'' Wilder said. He noted that the legislature granted his
requests for a cap on college tuition increases, a budget reserve
and a repeal of the sales tax on non-prescription drugs.
   ``I've been very impressed with the degree of support,'' he said.

   The lame-duck Sandinista Front is
searching hard for a new identity to help it become a viable
opposition party by the next presidential election six years from
now.
   So far, the party's transformation has included shifting away
from leftist revolutionary rhetoric and becoming more open and
mainstream.
   ``Sandinismo has a big problem: it doesn't know what it is,''
said Emilio Alvarez Montalvan, a veteran of Nicaraguan politics and
foreign affairs adviser to conservative President-elect Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro, who is to take office Wednesday.
   ``They're not guerrillas any more, they're not
Marxist-Leninists, they don't like being Social-Democrats, by
definition they're not Social-Christians, much less Conservatives
or Liberals. What are they, then? They themselves don't know,''
Alvarez said in a recent interview.
   Losing the Feb. 25 general elections to Mrs. Chamorro's 14-party
National Opposition Union was a shock and an embarrassment to the
Sandinistas, who had ruled for nearly 11 years.
   More than a half-dozen opinion polls had given them a wide lead
over UNO. Their last campaign rally was the largest political
gathering in Nicaraguan history, drawing more than 300,000 people.
   ``They lied to us,'' one party leader from the Interior Ministry
said bitterly after the final tally showed UNO obtained 55 percent
of the vote.
   Still, the Sandinista Front got 40.8 percent of the vote which,
because UNO is a coalition, still leaves it as the single largest
party in Nicaragua.
   That, to its leaders, means the mass support is still there, but
the party's approach and even its image must change before the next
elections in six years.
   ``I think the cycle of anti-imperialist revolutions is coming to
an end,'' said Victor Tirado Lopez, one of nine commanders of the
1979 revolution that make up the Sandinista Front's National
Directorate. ``Therefore, we must re-examine our path.''
   ``What does the electoral defeat of Sandinismo express? That the
people want peace and we can't keep pointing to war to resolve
social contradictions,'' Tirado said in an interview published in
March in Barricada, the official Sandinista Front newspaper.
   In 1984, the Sandinista Front and President Daniel Ortega
obtained 64 percent of the vote. The war with the U.S.-backed
Contra rebels was about two years old then and the revolutionary
fervor that had toppled rightist President Anastasio Somoza was
still high.
   But after a decade of war and economic hardship resulting from a
U.S. economic embargo and Sandinista administrative imcompetence,
Nicaraguans apparently decided to believe UNO's promise that only
it could bring peace and prosperity to the nation.
   The Sandinista leadership met in emergency session and came out
with a pronouncement that gave a glimpse of the party's new
direction.
   ``We have the total willingness to back all those actions that
go in favor of the people, but we have the willingess and firm will
to oppose and resist with the strength of the people all those
actions that go against the people,'' Ortega said in a speech less
than 48 hours after the election.
   His vow to ``rule from below'' has become the new Sandinista
slogan, one that draws strength from a grassroots organization
built on labor unions, farm cooperatives, women and youth groups.
   After the elections, the Sandinista Front announced it would
join the Socialist International, a worldwide association of
parties that generally advocate socialism through democratic reform
rather than armed revolution.
   That indicates a change of attitude reinforced by last year's
dramatic fall of hard-line Communist leaders in the Soviet bloc.
   ``Ten or 20 years ago many people underestimated electoral
democracy. They only accepted armed struggle and insurrection to
grab power from the bourgueoisie,'' Tirado said. ``Today, times
have changed.''
   More recently, the Sandinistas have rushed to get a hold on mass
media, knowing they will need a public forum.
   Nearly the entire staff of The Voice of Nicaragua, the
government radio station, has started to move to Radio Ya, a new
station being set up at Sandinista headquarters.
   Workers at another Sandinista-dominated radio station, La
Primerisima, have been given ownership of the facility.
   The front also started an alternative nightly news hour called
ExtraVision broadcast on Nicaragua's sole TV station, the
Sandinista Television System.
   The Sandinistas already have begun acting like an opposition
party, threatening strikes if the Contras don't fulfill an accord
to dismantle by June 10.
   Ortega, in a televised speech last week, said enforcing that
accord was the Sandinistas' main objective for the next few months.
It amounted to a description of his job as a political leader and
gave the party a rallying theme.

<HEAD>Harvard Law Professor May Request Leave To Protest Lack Of
Diversity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE BARTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tenured black professor at Harvard Law
School is threatening to request a leave of absence to protest the
lack of women and minorities on the school's faculty.
   The professor, Derrick Bell, has decided to go on leave and stay
on leave without pay until a black woman has been offered and
accepts a position on the law school faculty, according to a
statement he prepared for release Tuesday by a student activist
group.
   Reached Monday night, Bell refused to discuss the matter in
detail, referring a reporter to the student Coalition for Civil
Rights, which has been staging protests demanding the hiring of
more minority faculty at the law school. The law school has five
black professors, three of them tenured, out of a faculty of more
than 65, according to Bell.
   According to coalition spokesman Keith Boykin, Bell prepared the
following statement for release Tuesday:
   ``I cannot in good conscience continue in a role that limits
rather than expands faculty diversity. I cannot continue to urge
students to take risks for what they believe if I do not practice
my own precepts.''
   ``I hope students will be moved by my example to continue their
efforts to gain sooner rather than later the diversity in our
faculty that is now so positive a force in our student body,'' his
statement said.
   Before the noon rally where Bell was scheduled to make his
announcement, he and the law school administration were expected to
hold talks about the possibility hiring of a black woman on law
school faculty.
   Bell and the Coalition for Civil Rights are urging the school to
hire Regina Austin, a black woman who is a visiting professor at
Harvard. Austin has been offered a permanent post at the University
of Michigan, Boykin said Monday.
   Bell, 59, is a former member of the Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee, a civil rights group. He first taught at
the law school in 1969 but left in 1980 to become dean of the
University of Oregon Law School. Bell returned to Harvard in 1986,
where he was then the only tenured black professor.
   Last May, during student sit-ins to protest what they called a
lack of diversity on the faculty, some students pushed to have Bell
named dean of the law school.
   Bell put the number of minority students at the school at 400,
with fewer than 200 of those black. Harvard Law School has about
1,500 students.
   Bell said that there were only five female law professors, none
of them black.
   ``The students have been urging greater diversity. I guess it's
been happening in many other places around the country,'' Bell said
Monday night. ``Thus far, there has not been very much in the way
of positive response to demands given the administration a couple
of months ago.''

<DATELINE>MUEHLHAUSEN, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housewives in this border town
silently curse pushy West Germans who grab all the seats at the
beauty parlor.
   They and their husbands are tired of seeing well-off West
Germans load up their cars with relatively cheap state-subsidized
goods, from tools to meat, and drive back across the border.
   Citizens of the two Germanys are getting to know one other after
40 years of separation, but don't always like what they see.
   ``I'd say 80 percent of them are really good people, but then
there's that other 20 percent,'' Uwe Fritsch said of the West
Germans. Fritsch runs an electronics store in this drab border town
185 miles west of Berlin.
   People in Muehlhausen and towns on the other side of the hilly
frontier look upon the opening of the border as the most important
event in postwar German history.
   East Germans have their freedom and good chances for future
prosperity. West Germans probably will increase their own wealth
and international clout after reunification.
   Close friendships have sprung up, and in some ways the frontier
has ceased to exist.
   As in marriage, however, the Germans are discovering that their
new partners are imperfect.
   Some East Germans see Western visitors as brash, rude people who
like to show off their wealth, and view themselves as humbler folk
not consumed by greed.
   In West Germany, a popular view is that East Germans are
backward, lazy and unrefined.
   A shoplifting boom in West German border towns also has dampened
some of the reunification euphoria.
   ``All along the border from Schleswig-Holstein to Bavaria,
department store and supermarket managers are unable to rescue
themselves from long fingers from the East,'' Stern magazine said.
   Most of the discontent is on the eastern side of the border.
   There even have been reports of brawls in East German taverns.
   One began in Muehlhausen when an inebriated East German sitting
across from a West German, who was trying to make time with an East
German woman, suddenly declared: ``All Westerners are liars.''
   Young West Germans often head ``over there'' on the prowl for
young East German women who are impressed by fast cars, motorcycles
and West German marks.
   Many ``Wessis'' also come in search of state-subsidized goods
and services.
   At a good restaurant in East Germany, for example, a meal might
cost one-third of the price in the West. The official exchange rate
for tourists is three East marks for every West mark; on the black
market it's 6 for 1.
   West Germans have mobbed border towns like Muehlhausen to buy
bargain-priced goods.
   ``It's not fair when you have to wait in a long line and then
find out everything you wanted is gone,'' said Barbara Weber, Uwe
Fritsch's sister, who helps him in the store.
   One recent day, a West German family loaded up their mobile home
with armloads of meat, presumably to freeze at home.
   Roswitha Vogler, who works in a butcher shop, said the crowd of
West Germans in the beauty parlor angers many Muehlhausen women.
``On Saturdays there isn't a single place left,'' she said.
   Aggressiveness is not exclusive to Westerners.
   At the Stadt Muehlhausen hotel, a Westerner sitting with an East
German woman paid for their meal and drinks with West marks.
   ``You idiot!'' the woman snapped. ``Why didn't you tell me you
needed Ost marks? I would have changed your money at one-to-four.''

   Real estate problems are spreading from the
Southwest and Northeast, threatening metropolitan markets across
the nation, according to a new statistical analysis by banking
regulators.
   Banks in regions already beset with falling or flat real estate
prices have responded by tightening their lending policies. An
analysis by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. shows that lenders
elsewhere also may have reason for concern.
   The FDIC, which insures bank and savings and loan deposits up to
$100,000, has fashioned what it hopes will be an early warning
system that identifies soft real estate markets before they turn
sour.
   A preliminary version released last week examined commercial
real estate in 40 metropolitan areas. Some well-known sore spots in
the Southwest ranked high on the list. Phoenix, Ariz.; was first,
Austin, Texas, was sixth and Oklahoma City was seventh.
   But many of the riskiest markets were surprises. Nashville,
Tenn., was second, followed by Anaheim, Calif., Atlanta and
Philadelphia. Rounding out the top 10 were San Jose, Calif.,
Detroit, and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   The FDIC ranked the markets on three factors: increase in new
office construction started, growth in office jobs and change in
office vacancy rates.
   Markets with the slowest job growth, the biggest increase in
construction and the steepest increase in vacancies are considered
the most vulnerable to a downturn.
   ``Our preliminary work has led us to conclude that extraordinary
growth is often followed by an economic downturn,'' said FDIC
Chairman L. William Seidman. ``Imprudent growth can result in real
estate supply getting ahead of market demand, sometimes with
extremely unfavorable results.''
   ``When things are good, builders want to build and lenders want
to lend,'' said economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial
Associates of West Chester, Pa. ``But what happens is you get
overbuilding. Vacancy rates can take off very quickly,''
   A report last week by Alex Sheshunoff, an Austin, Texas,
consultant, underscored the consequences when bank lending becomes
too gung ho.
   Commercial banks last year earned $16.3 billion, 34 percent less
than in 1988. Sheshunoff attributed much of the deterioration to
real estate lending.
   Delinquent real estate loans more than doubled in eight of nine
states in the Northeast last year, he said. They tripled in
Massachusetts and were six times higher in Connecticut.
   Sheshunoff, however, predicted that a crackdown by banking
regulators will prevent the kind of real estate bust that hit the
oil-producing states of the Southwest in the mid 1980s.
   ``It is often the regulators' job to prescribe preventive
medicine,'' he said. ``It means pulling the punch bowl away from
the party earlier in the evening to the profound displeasure of the
party-goers.''
   Regulators' scrutiny of bank lending has drawn complaints from
borrowers, politicians and economists who say credit is drying up
even for good projects.
   The National Association of Home Builders last week trimmed its
housing starts projection for this year by 30,000 units to 1.35
million, attributing the drop in part to a ``regulatory credit
crunch.''
   New England business executives and members of Congress are
planning a meeting with federal regulators in Boston this week
concerning what Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., called
``over-regulation.''
   They've been particularly upset with examiners from the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency, which supervises nationally
chartered banks and has ordered large writedowns at many
institutions in the region.
   A study released last week by the Federal Reserve Board
confirmed that a ``large majority'' of 60 of the country's largest
banks had tightened real estate lending in the last six months.
   The banks blamed the credit crunch largely on economic
conditions rather than on closer scrutiny by regulators. However,
some economists believe the squeeze is a cause and not just a
symptom of the economic slowdown.
   ``Not long ago, almost anyone who was willing to pay the right
price _ interest rates _ was able to get credit. That is no longer
true,'' economist Sung Won Sohn of Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis
said in a recent newsletter. ``Credit rationing is hurting economic
growth ... (for) the first time since the early 1970s.''
   ``To me it is a time for regulators to be judicious in their
actions, not to squeeze down too hard. ... I'm very concerned. A
lot of this country's wealth is tied up in real estate,'' said
William Isaac, a former FDIC chairman who now heads The Secura
Group consulting firm.
   Officials in the comptroller's office maintain that it is
economic conditions that have toughened, not their examination
standards. Earlier this month they took the unusual step of holding
briefings for financial analysts and reporters to deny that they
had launched a crackdown.
   ``Circumstances have changed. ... We have to come in and put
some reality back in. That's our job,'' said Richard Kovarik, a
senior bank examiner in the comptroller's office.
   Don Inscoe, the FDIC's research director, defended his agency's
risk list from criticism that regulators in effect declared a loan
moratorium for some areas.
   ``We aren't necessarily saying you shouldn't lend in the places
high on the list. We're just saying that in the past, extremely
high growth has resulted in a crash,'' he said.

   Only in America could an Irish bandleader
in a town of Polish immigrants transform that most hokey of ethnic
music into sounds worthy of Carnegie Hall.
   You see, polkas don't come just with kielbasa, anymore.
   ``Slush down some beer and Polish sausage _ that's all some
people see when they think of the polka,'' said Fred Hudy,
president of the International Polka Association in Chicago.
``We're trying to get rid of that image.''
   ``They're definitely out of the closet, now,'' said Ian Dove,
spokesman for the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences,
which added a polka category to the Grammys five years ago.
   The Jimmy Sturr Orchestra is riding the new wave of polka
popularity, winning the Grammy four straight years. Sturr has
played at New York's Carnegie Hall six times, the only polka band
to perform that much at the celebrated concert auditorium.
   Once relegated to the stomping grounds of local sausage fests or
to Sunday morning radio broadcasts, the polka is following Latin
American and Cajun into the musical mainstream.
   ``It's big business,'' said Sturr, 42, an Irish bandleader who
lives in the Orange County village of Florida about 30 miles
northwest of New York City.
   His 10-piece orchestra has recorded 76 albums _ 75 polka and one
country _ on his Starr Records label, which he started in 1964. The
label records other polka, country and ethnic groups, including
Bobby Vinton.
   Getting its own Grammy category has completed the legitimization
of a musical form once thought squarer than the square dance. Until
1985, polka music was lumped into the catchall folk category, Dove
said.
   ``It was felt that polka was a form of music unto itself,'' he
said. Similarly, the Grammy trustees created separate categories
for reggae, tropical Latin and Mexican-American music in recent
years.
   Sturr started his first band when he was 11. Though Irish, he
was surrounded by Polish-Americans, who made up four-fifths of his
hometown's population. Sturr grew up with the polka and fell in
love with the music. He began recording and touring with his polka
band in the musical maelstrom of the 1960s, when most people viewed
the polka as a dance confined to the bowling alley crowds of
Milwaukee or Buffalo.
   ``It's moved out of that ethnic category,'' Sturr said. ``Now
everybody enjoys the polka. When I was a kid and somebody said,
`Hey, what kind of band do you have,' I'd be embarrassed to say I'm
in a polka band.''
   Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perprich declared 1990 the Year of the
Polka. Thousands attend polka festivals each year in Minnesota,
which claims to have ``the granddaddy of all polka fests,'' in
Gibbon, Minn.
   Like Cajun and country, the shrill brass and reedy woodwinds of
some polka styles revolve around the accordion, which is enjoying
its own return from corn purgatory.
   ``It's a happy music, it's a snappy music,'' Hudy said. ``Your
feet automatically tap.''
   Several rock groups have transformed themselves into new wave
polka bands, turning out what Sturr calls ``punk polka.'' One such
band, Rotundi, has scored a parody polka hit with ``Polka Till You
Puke.''
   In the United States, the polka is most closely associated with
Polish-Americans. Yet the polka _ invented in 1830 by a peasant
girl in Bohemia, now part of Czechoslovakia _ never was popular in
Poland, even though it was influenced by Polish styles of music and
dance.
   As the polka swept through Europe in the 1830s and '40s, Poland
was trying to regain its independence from Russia. Other Europeans
considered the polka _ a two-step with a hop thrown in _ a dance of
sympathy for Poland's oppression. But the Poles felt the polka
mocked the way Polish women danced, said Charles Keil, American
studies professor at the state University of Buffalo.
   Europeans had a ``general fascination with Poland as a
struggling country whose borders had been violated. ... That's
where polka dots came from. Everybody was naming things after the
polka,'' said Keil, whose book, ``Polka Happiness,'' is being
published by Temple University.
   From Europe, the polka traveled around the world. It became
Paraguay's national dance, while American Indians out West adopted
a form of polka in the 1860s.
   ``Those Indians think of the polka as their traditional music
nowadays,'' Keil said.
   While Sturr's Polish-American polkas win Grammys,
Mexican-American bands in southern Texas are producing the most
innovative polka music today, Keil said.
   The Mexican-American style mixes Latin and polka rhythms, while
Sturr's eastern Polish style relies on woodwinds, accordions and a
frantic beat. In the Midwest, the slower German polka _ with its
brassy oompahs _ is popular, while plucky banjos highlight country
polka styles.
   Polkas must be written in two-four time, two quarter notes per
measure, a tempo which gives the music its dancy beat. The songs
can range from the ``Too-Fat Polka'' _ with its whimsical chorus,
``I don't want her, you can have her, she's too fat for me'' _ to
the more sentimental ``Did You Ever Fall in Love Polka'' from one
of Sturr's albums.
   Songwriter Steve Lopuch has contributed three songs to Sturr's
records, including titles on his 1988 Grammy album ``I Remember
Warsaw'' and this year's winner, ``All in My Love for You.''
   Lopuch's source material ranges from nursery rhymes in ``The
Crooked Man Polka'' to all-American denim in ``The Blue Jeans
Polka.''
   ``When these people came, the Irish, Polish, Lithuanians,
Germans, Italians, they didn't have nothing,'' said Lopuch, a
retired dairy farmer in the Montgomery County town of Florida, 30
miles west of Albany _ not to be confused with the village of
Florida where Sturr grew up. ``They planned to stay a few years,
make some money and go back, but most didn't go back. They stayed,
and so did their music.''
   Lopuch has written about a dozen polkas based on nursery rhymes
which he hopes to have recorded by Sturr's orchestra or some other
polka band.
   ``I'm hoping grandparents will buy it for their grandchildren so
they don't listen only to rock,'' Lopuch said.
   Keil has similar hopes that more young people will turn to
polka. Local polka fests are dying out because ``a younger
generation has not come along and gotten into the dancing of it in
any big way,'' he said.
   He predicts there will be a revival of polka dancing. ``It's so
good _ it's eating, drinking, dancing, partying music. Because it
survived so long despite rock 'n' roll, despite TV, because some
fanatic people won't give it up. ... It's a matter of young people
getting really bored with post-punk nonsense. People will see that
community dancing is a powerful thing.''

   Danica McKellar, Winnie Cooper on ABC's
``Wonder Years,'' is a polite 15-year-old who gets A's in school.
Perfect casting, right?
   ``I'm not Winnie,'' Danica said in the April 28 issue of TV
Guide. ``Winnie is perfect. She has no faults. And she does what
the script says.''
   Danica was cast as the potential love interest of series star
Fred Savage just days before ``The Wonder Years'' started shooting.
It came down to two candidates, Danica and her 13-year-old sister,
Crystal.
   ``It was practically a tossup,'' said casting head Mary Buck.
``But finally they picked Danica.''
   Crystal has appeared on the show as Winnie's rival, Becky.
   ``We don't compete,'' Danica said. ``We each give a performance
and do the best we can, and it's up to the producers.''

   Goldie Hawn, the go-go dancer who turned a
wide-eyed dumb blonde routine into a string of hit movies in the
1970s, is hoping to revitalize her career in the 1990s.
   ``I didn't become a movie star because I made people cry, or
because I had some incredible romantic persona,'' Hawn said in an
interview in the May issue of Fame magazine. ``I came on the scene
with an effervescence and a lightness and an ability to elevate
spirits, which, by the way, I do not sell short.''

   Amarillo Slim earned his reputation on
the poker table, but he also is becoming known for his love of
another sport.
   The former world poker champion has built a golf course in his
back yard that was named this year's Most Unique Course in Texas on
Sunday by The Dallas Morning News.
   It's an exercise in excess, although it only has four par 3
holes.
   A person driving into this Panhandle city on a clear night can
see seven colors of lights shooting into the sky from the golf
course.
   The course, which is built over a tennis court, has a
computerized watering system, a water hazard, 500 square feet of
greens, imported rocks, floral landscaping, and a real rarity in
these parts _ trees.
   Slim's real name is Thomas Austin Preston Jr.

   British rocker Billy Idol was released from a
hospital after another round of surgery to repair a leg badly
injured in a motorcycle crash.
   Surgeons at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Wednesday implanted a
steel rod in Idol's right leg to help repair a bone that had not
been healing properly, said the musician's publicist, Ellen Golden.
He was released on Sunday.
   The 34-year-old spike-haired singer known for his hits ``White
Wedding'' and ``Rebel Yell'' was seriously hurt in February when
his motorcycle collided with a car in Hollywood. Police said Idol,
who was not wearing a helmet, ran a stop sign.
   He has undergone several operations on the leg since the
accident.
   Ms. Golden said Idol will begin work next month on an Oliver
Stone film about the rock group The Doors.

   Mario Bonilla was traveling outside Nicaragua in
1981 when he was tried for promoting human rights. He never
returned home after learning he had been sentenced to 23 years in
prison for counterrevolutionary activities.
   Like thousands of other Nicaraguan professionals, Bonilla, a
doctor, fled to South Florida to escape the leftist Sandinista
regime of Daniel Ortega.
   But now that the euphoria of Violeta Chamorro's upset
presidential victory over Ortega in February has subsided, the
professionals Nicaragua needs desperately are weighing a return
carefully _ and many are choosing not to go back.
   Some of the reasons are financial. But much of the concern is
over the role the defeated Sandinistas will play after the new
government is sworn in Wednesday and how those returning will be
treated.
   ``We are afraid,'' said Bonilla, president of the Nicaraguan
Medical Association in Exile. ``(The Sandinistas) are in the same
place with the same weapons. There are only some changes in the
administrative area at this moment.''
   ``The exile community is in agreement all should work hard to
help our country,'' said Roberto Arguello, founding president of
the Nicaraguan-American Bankers and Businessmen Association. ``But
we're all being very cautious because the new government is very
fragile.''
   The Chamorro government has been sending a special message to
the estimated 150,000 Nicaraguan exiles in Miami: We need you to
help rebuild the country, in ruins after a decade of civil war.
   Emotional appeals to exiled professionals have come in person
recently from Vice President-elect Virgilio Gody; Mrs. Chamorro's
chief economic adviser, Francisco Mayorga, and the
president-elect's son, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro. Mrs. Chamorro
addressed exiles last month in Houston, where she was treated for a
knee injury.
   ``It's a country that has been drained of its talent,'' said
Adolfo Calero, a former director of the Nicaraguan Resistance, a
now-disbanded umbrella group for anti-Sandinista rebels, or Contras.
   ``There's a need for people with know-how _ not only
professionals, but technical and skilled (workers) and politicians,
lawyers, engineers, doctors.''
   Yet the exiles, many of whom lost their homes, businesses and
properties to the Sandinistas, remain wary about the transition to
a multiparty democracy following a decade under revolutionary
Sandinista rule.
   A recent survey of some 3,000 members of the Federation of
Nicaraguan Professional Association in Exile, which represents
professions from engineers to lawyers, found about 20 percent
wanted to return to their homeland.
   That number is expected to go up some after the Chamorro
government is sworn in, said Bonilla, who also is president of the
federation.
   Bonilla said those going back are seeking guarantees of their
safety. He has decided to stay here, but not just because of
political concerns.
   Bonilla, a psychiatrist, is among 100 Nicaraguan physicians
enrolled in a program created by the state last year for them to
obtain licenses to practice in Florida. Each doctor gets a $10,000
interest-free loan to finance his studies.
   Even those who have established themselves in this country and
have the resources for a quick return to Nicaragua are proceeding
slowly.
   Last month, Dr. Antonio Lourenco was among the first exiles to
go back and try to reclaim his home in an exclusive neighborhood of
Managua. The Coral Gables psychiatrist lost his just-built home
when dictator Anastasio Somoza fell while the family was in Miami
on vacation in 1979.
   He found during his visit a country ``destroyed in every aspect
_ physically, morally, economically. ... Now the people are willing
to rebuild the country and start over.''
   Lourenco wants to be part of that process, but he expects a long
battle in the courts first to get back his home and properties
confiscated by the Sandinistas.
   The Chamorro government has said it is prepared to create a fund
to reimburse owners who can't get back their homes through the
courts.
   Meanwhile, Portuguese-born Lourenco plans to contribute by
visiting Managua once a month and seeing some patients ``until I
can see more clear the situation.''
   Even if most exiles could return, Nicaragua would not be able to
absorb them all at once, said Arguello, citing high unemployment
and a housing shortage.
   But many exiles have already begun to explore investment
opportunities since the Bush administration lifted a five-year
economic embargo after Mrs. Chamorro's victory and proposed a $300
million aid package.
   Some are optimistic about returning.
   Eduardo Miranda, assistant chief of surgical residents at a Dade
County hospital, has begun planning his return with his wife and
three children. He said they always expected to go back to
Nicaragua once fighting ended.
   ``I trust the Sandinistas, too, because I think they have been
changing lately. I think they're not going to give Chamorro any
trouble,'' Miranda said.

<HEAD>Singer Don Henley Leads Campaign to Protect Walden Pond</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last month, 25 years after first reading
``Walden'' in high school in East Texas, rock singer Don Henley
finally visited this picturesque, sandy pond that inspired Henry
David Thoreau more than a century ago.
   The Walden Pond he saw, which lies less than a hundred yards
from a highway and is adjacent to a dump, is far less pastoral than
when Walden lived by its shore in a tiny shack in 1845.
   ``I've been an active environmentalist for over 20 years and
part of that activism stems from reading his works,'' said Henley.
``I just assumed Walden would be preserved forever.''
   The Grammy-winning singer was moved to visit Walden Pond and
Walden Woods after watching a TV report about residents fighting a
proposed condominium project a half mile from the pond.
   Proponents of the project, including the developers and some
state officials, say it will mean affordable housing. Residents
believe it will mar the area, and they want to make the 3,000-acre
area a national landmark.
   After watching the TV report, Henley organized friends such as
Bonnie Raitt, Glenn Frey, Bob Seger, John Cougar Mellencamp, Don
Johnson and Carrie Fisher for two concerts at the Worcester Centrum
this week to raise money to buy up land near the pond and preserve
it. The amount of money needed has not been disclosed.
   ``You hear all this hoopla about Earth Day and how far we've
come as a nation and our new consciousness about the environment,''
Henley said in a telephone interview last week. ``But it seems
incredibly ironic that we can't preserve the place where that
consciousness came from. Thoreau for all practical purposes is the
father of the environmental movement.''
   Henley's Walden Woods Project also includes environmental
leaders, scholars and politicians. Henley, 42, is co-chairman along
with Michael Kennedy, 32, the son of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. Former
Sen. Paul Tsongas and Mohandas Gandhi's grandson, Arun Gandhi, a
writer and philosopher, are among the members.
   The group's focus has been criticized by state officials who say
``the celebrities'' don't realize they are helping block affordable
housing.
   Amy S. Anthony, state secretary of communities and development,
sent a letter to Henley claiming his group's campaign is ``a
thinly-veiled attempt on the part of a few to obstruct the
construction of affordable housing in a wealthy suburban
community.''
   Kennedy, who runs a Boston company that provides low-cost
heating oil to the poor, said affordable housing is compatible with
preservation of Walden Woods.
   Walden Pond is a 62-acre body of water in a 333-acre state
reservation on the edge of Concord, an affluent town of 12,500
about 20 miles from Boston.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several environmental organizations at the
forefront of Earth Day celebrations are under fire from a seemingly
unrelated group planning its own march on the Capitol next weekend
_ the National Right to Life Committee.
   The anti-abortion leaders are asking members to withhold support
from environmental groups they regard as pro-abortion. Among those
on the list: the Sierra Club, the National Audubon Society and the
National Wildlife Federation.
   They also are criticizing the League of Conservation Voters, the
environmental movement's major political action committee, for
including ``abortion-related votes'' on its 1989 congressional
scorecard.
   Douglas Johnson, Right to Life's legislative director, said the
listed groups are trying to overturn ``major pro-life policies,''
including the so-called Mexico City Policy that denies U.S. funds
for organizations that promote abortion as a method of family
planning in foreign countries.
   ``Fortunately, there are other environmental and wildlife
organizations which do not engage in pro-abortion activities,''
Johnson told members in last month's newsletter.
   ``Readers are encouraged to disseminate the names of both the
`good' and `bad' environmental groups in local pro-life
newsletters, church newspapers and the like,'' he said.
   Ali Webb, director of elections for the League of Conservation
Voters, said her organization was targeted because it advocates
family planning.
   ``They (Right to Life) represent a point of view that family
planning is not an appropriate arena for environmental action. But
if something isn't done, the world population will double in the
next 37 years,'' Webb said.
   ``The world's ecosystem is unable to support that many people.
The problems of deforestation and global warming are due to the
fact that there are too many bodies on earth,'' she said.
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,
said there is a ``natural alliance'' between environmentalists and
the pro-choice movement.
   ``People need to understand the connection between family
planning and our ability to feed people and save the planet,'' Yard
said in an interview. ``I think the Right to Life Committee is very
afraid of what might happen if the environmental groups join us.
They are not dumb.''
   Right to Life is most critical of the National Wildlife
Federation and the National Audubon Society. It accuses both of
misleading members about their positions on abortion.
   Although opposed to the Sierra Club's stand on abortion, Right
to Life gave that group some credit because it ``does not seek to
conceal'' its policy recognizing abortion as an acceptable means of
controlling population growth.
   William W. Howard, executive vice president of the National
Wildlife Federation, said his group has tried to explain its
position to Right to Life and specifically to Johnson for more than
a year.
   ``The National Wildlife Federation does not promote abortion,''
he said. ``We have no policy position specifically on abortion. Our
policies are directed toward population stabilization and quality
of life.''
   Patricia Baldi, the National Audubon Society's director of
population, said Right to Life has distorted her group's position.
She said it has no position on abortion but supports family
planning programs as a critical element of population control.
   ``For a long time environmental groups thought they were
controversial enough without getting into family planning. But that
is changing,'' she said.
   ``I think the real fear at Right to Life is what will happen if
8 million people in the environmental community decide they want to
do something on this issue. We really have the potential to turn
this thing around,'' Baldi said.
   Nancy Wallace, director of the Sierra Club's international
population program, said if the Right to Life Committee has any
real interest in the environment it will endorse proposals to
increase international contraception funding.

<HEAD>Iran Passes Law To Execute Profiteers, Hoarders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To combat consumer shortages, Iran's
parliament has approved the death penalty for people convicted of
hoarding, profiteering and black market dealings, Tehran radio
reports.
   In a broadcast monitored Sunday in Nicosia, the radio said ``if
profiteering or hoarding is meant to counter the Islamic Republic's
establishment, the profiteer and hoarder will be executed.''
   Iranian officials and the media call such individuals ``economic
terrorists.''
   Iranians contend daily with shortages of consumer goods while a
black market flourishes for those with the means to pay exorbitant
prices. It is common practice for shopkeepers and businessmen to
divert government-subsidized consumer goods to the black market.
   Ayatollah Emami Kashani, a member of 12-man Council of
Guardians, which screens all legislation for conformity with
Islamic law and the constitution, told the radio that his committee
approved the bill.
   Kashani said that according to the law, the wealth and property
of profiteers and hoarders could be confiscated by the government.
   The draconian law comes during a growing outcry about official
corruption and economic problems, including an annual inflation
rate unofficially estimated anywhere between 100 to 200 percent.
   Iranian opposition groups have reported protests in several
Iranian cities in recent weeks, with demonstrators demanding
economic reforms.
   A radical Iranian daily last month reported sharp price
increases over the last year for a number of items.
   The Farsi-languge Jomhuri Islami reported that the price of
lentils had gone up almost threefold to 1,300 rials ($18 at the
official exchange rate) a kilo (2.2 pounds), while a pair of men's
pants sold for 11,000 rials ($157).

<TEXT>
   Some think it odd that Greta Garbo, the nation's
most famous recluse, lived in its most crowded city.
   But this is because they do not understand the allure of New
York's dense street life, and the implicit contract between true
New Yorkers and true celebrities, a pact that confers on the famous
a pleasing mixture of adulation and anonymity.
   Garbo, who died April 15 at age 84, wasn't really a recluse, and
she didn't come here to be alone. She didn't like to talk to
journalists or have her picture taken, but she liked to do
something that is harder and harder to do in this country _ walk
along city streets to run errands, stretch the legs and see what's
going on.
   She was able to do this in New York because of the
aforementioned contract, which stipulates that when New Yorkers
spot a star, they suppress the urge to point and scream, and keep
their distance; the celebrity returns the favor by acknowledging
the recognition with a nod, wink or half-smile.
   Celebrities, accordingly, can walk to work, eat at a restaurant,
watch a ballgame or visit a museum without being mobbed, yet enjoy
the reassurance that their presence has not gone unnoticed.
   In Los Angeles, celebrities have all the privacy they want _
back yard swimming and tennis, drive-in everything, restaurants
with unlisted phone numbers. Privacy, at any rate, can be obtained
anywhere, as Howard Hughes found in Las Vegas and J.D. Salinger has
found in New Hampshire.
   But if that's what most celebrities wanted they would have
become monks or cloistered nuns.
   John Lennon had to be dragged here in the early '70s by Yoko
Ono, and the couple moved into the Dakota apartment building
because of its security. But he soon realized that sophisticated
New York was relatively free of suffocating Beatlemania, yet
sufficiently appreciative of his genius.
   Above all, it was a real place, a tough, worldly, port city like
Liverpool and Hamburg. Biographer Albert Goldman reports that
Lennon was ``thrilled by fresh contact with the street,'' such as
the time he and a street musician were told to move on by a
policeman in front of the Fillmore East rock ballroom.
   As it turned out, Lennon in 1980 was shot to death by an
obsessed fan outside the Dakota.
   Especially for younger movie and pop stars, New York's allure
lies somewhere between getting lost in the crowd and drawing a
crowd, and it ties into the desire of many creative people to see
and be seen, albeit discreetly.
   Listen to actress Elizabeth McGovern, one of the growing number
of film stars who live here: ``To walk down the street in New York
keeps me more connected to real life as opposed to the isolation
you feel in L.A., where you're always in a car and always reminded
of the movie business.'' She also rides the subway.
   While the good life in Beverly Hills is tarnished by the
spectacle of tourist buses rolling past the stars' homes,
Manhattan's only equivalent is an out-of-print ``Map of the Stars'
Homes'' and walking tours of celebrity neighborhoods.
   The map was discontinued after several stars sued; the walking
tours are hardly intrusive. Tour director Sam Stafford says that
when Lillian Gish complained, he stopped mentioning the elderly
actress' address on East 57th Street.
   Tour members hear a lot of stories about the stars but see only
the drawn blinds of their apartment house windows. There are a few
exceptions: One tour bumped into Paul Simon on Fifth Avenue, and
another encountered Carly Simon in Central Park. He posed for
photos, and she signed autographs.
   Much of the time celebrities pass unnoticed, sometimes with the
help of sunglasses (Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis) and floppy hats
(Woody Allen). Dustin Hoffman is notorious for profanely refusing
autograph requests; Mrs. Onassis says no and keeps walking.
   Some stars think their privacy is being violated when it isn't.
Startled by the pop of a flashbulb as he dined at the Four Seasons,
Yul Brynner demanded that his waiter confiscate the film from the
shutterbug's Polaroid. As the picture developed, however, the actor
was embarrassed to see that the subject was not his gleaming dome
but the dessert cart.

<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Words like deceit, greed, revenge and
corruption have been used before in Arkansas politics, but not
often in a Republican gubernatorial primary.
   This year's GOP race between Rep. Tommy Robinson and Sheffield
Nelson, former friends and Democrats who abandoned the party last
year, has all the intrigue of a prime-time soap opera.
   The likely Democratic nominee is four-term Gov. Bill Clinton,
who pulled back from a presidential bid in 1988 and is regarded as
a potential presidential candidate for 1992 or beyond.
   Nelson, a Little Rock attorney, made $7.7 million in 12 years at
the helm of Arkansas' biggest gas utility, sometimes helping
Robinson, who was sheriff of Pulaski County _ which includes Little
Rock _ in the early 1980s.
   Their duel for the GOP nomination has focused more attention on
a tangled web of dealings, involving three power brokers who like
to stay behind the scenes, than on matters of public policy.
   Two of the key figures are brothers W.R. ``Witt'' Stephens and
Jackson T. Stephens, owners of the largest U.S. investment firm off
Wall Street. The third is Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, a
lifetime pal of Robinson's _ until this campaign.
   Kingmakers since the segregation-era days of six-term governor
Orval E. Faubus, the Stephens family's political apparatus, which
appeared to slumber in recent years, has revived to try to crush
Nelson and carry Robinson.
   ``They own him lock stock and barrel,'' Nelson says.
   Nelson owes a lot to Witt. Stephens, who headed the Arkla Inc.
natural gas utility, helped Nelson get a job with the company,
promoted the young lawyer, and when Stephens retired in 1973,
Nelson was the handpicked successor.
   The relationship soon soured. According to Nelson, Stephens
became upset when Nelson wouldn't have Arkla buy gas from Stephens
at inflated prices and refused to allow Arkla to deal with most of
the Stephens subsidiaries.
   ``I think they're greedy,'' Nelson said. ``I think they're mean.
I think they can hold grudges. And I think the best evidence I can
give you is the grudge they've held for me over the years.''
   Stephens, 82, a longtime Democrat, said the only candidate he's
supporting this year is his nephew, former Rep. Ray Thornton who's
running for Robinson's seat. But his feelings toward Nelson are
clear: ``I want all thieves beat. The way he managed the gas
company is not very commendable.''
   Robinson is among those pointing fingers at a deal Arkla made in
1982 under Nelson. The company sold mineral leases on thousands of
acres to Arkoma Productions, which was owned by Jones, who also was
a pal of Nelson.
   ``He sold our property too cheap _ those leases too cheap,''
Stephens said. ``In my opinion, he's a thief and I don't recommend
thieves to anybody.''
   Jones paid $15 million and spent another $35 million on drilling
and acquisitions before he sold the gas rights and the rest of his
company to Arkla in a deal whose eventual cost to Arkla was more
than $160 million.
   Robinson, meanwhile, lost his friendship with Jones by jumping
on the deal between Jones and Nelson: ``If he ran our state like
Arkla, the state would be bankrupt and Sheffield Nelson would end
up making Sam Walton look like a pauper.'' Walton is the
billionaire Wal-Mart founder.
   It was another close relationship gone sour.
   Jones and Robinson had grown up together in North Little Rock.
As a rich man, Jones loaned Robinson thousands of dollars to buy
Christmas presents, pay medical bills and get by. Asked in 1988 how
he managed to raise six children on a policeman's salary, Robinson
said: ``I borrowed money from Jerry Jones.''
   They also had a partnership in a farm, but their business ties
fell apart this year after Robinson's criticism of the deal and
after Jones' daughter, Charlotte, resigned as chief of Robinson's
staff.
   While Witt denounces Nelson but otherwise stays on the
sidelines, his brother, Jack, a Republican, supports Robinson.
Jack's wife, Mary Anne Stephens, is Robinson's campaign chairman,
and Terry Rose, Witt's son-in-law, is Robinson's campaign manager
in Pulaski County.
   The ties with the Stephens family have led to questions about
whether Robinson will exercise a free hand if he becomes governor.
   Says Robinson: ``Nobody controls me, just ask Jerry Jones.''

   Political support for a full-scale Star Wars
anti-missile defense is fading as fast as the Cold War tensions
that gave rise to the idea seven years ago.
   President Bush says he wants to deploy the system, which is
banned by an existing U.S.-Soviet treaty, as soon the Pentagon
decides the sensors, radars, satellites and ``hit-to-kill''
interceptors are ready. But even some members of Bush's own party
say the project needs reshaping in light of a receding Soviet
military threat.
   Others question Bush's commitment to preserving the vision his
former boss, President Reagan, first outlined in launching his
Strategic Defense Initiative on March 23, 1983.
   ``The president's going to have to get involved,'' Rep. William
Dickinson, R-Ala. He cautioned the project's director, Lt. Gen.
George Monahan, that many in Congress were itching to gut the
program, which has been nicknamed Star Wars for its proposed use of
futuristic weaponry.
   ``He's going to have to draw a line in the sand'' on an
acceptable level of spending for SDI, said Dickinson, a Star Wars
advocate. Otherwise, SDI supporters will get crushed in a
budget-cutting stampede.
   To hold back the charge on Capitol Hill, Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney launched a spring offensive to promote SDI, but his has been
a lonely voice. Cheney argues that because the Soviets remain the
only country capable of threatening the survival of the United
States, and because of doubt about the stability of the Kremlin
leadership, America needs a reliable defense against ballistic
missiles.
   A superpower arms treaty now under negotiation would reduce the
number of long-range nuclear missiles, but both sides would keep
more than enough to destroy each other.
   Cheney also put a new wrinkle on the administration's rationale:
protecting the United States and its overseas interests from a
possible small-scale ballistic missile attack by Third World
countries or from an accidental launch.
   Bush struck on this new theme when he visited Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in California two months ago to tout progress
in the ``brilliant pebbles'' technology that would place thousands
of self-contained kinetic rockets in permanent orbit. The
three-foot-long rockets would detect and track enemy missiles as
they left their silos, then vaporize the targets by ramming them at
30,000 mph.
   ``In the 1990s, strategic defense makes much more sense than
ever before,'' Bush declared.
   Last month, on the seventh anniversary of Reagan's speech
envisioning a Star Wars defense, Bush tried to reinforce the idea
that SDI was more than a protection against a Soviet threat.
   ``In a new international environment, as ballistic-missile
capabilities proliferate, defense against third-country threats
also becomes an increasingly important benefit,'' he said.
   For all that, SDI supporters have long suspected that Bush was a
lukewarm advocate. Some say the president may be forced in this
year's defense budget debate to show his true colors.
   ``It's fair to say that clear presidential prestige is now on
the line,'' says Baker Spring, analyst at the conservative Heritage
Foundation think tank and a strong advocate of SDI.
   Other analysts say that even with Bush pushing Congress to
provide more financial nourishment for Star Wars, the project is
unlikely ever to reach full blossom.
   ``The spirit behind SDI died with the end of the Reagan
administration,'' says Robert H. Kupperman, a science and
technology expert at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a Washington think tank.
   Even some of the Pentagon's senior SDI officials are suggesting
that a ballistic missile defense may never include the space-based
elements now under development.
   ``I don't know if a decision is ever going to be made to deploy
full-up,'' says Lt. Gen. Robert Hammond, commander of Star Wars
work at the Army's Strategic Defense Command. ``Maybe that's not
all bad.''
   Kupperman favors development of a small-scale defense against
ballistic missiles but says a full-blown defensive shield of the
kind now being pursued will fall victim to tighter defense budgets
and perceptions of a more peaceful world.
   ``The Congress is in no mood to fund it,'' he says.
   Money, not menace, now appears to be the predominant force
shaping the future of SDI.
   Bush has asked Congress to approve $4.8 billion in SDI spending
for the 1991 fiscal year starting Oct. 1, an increase of $1 billion
from this year. Much of the increase is earmarked for 16 tests of
key technologies, including the first attempt by a ``brilliant
pebble'' to intercept an object in sub-orbital space.
   It may be months before the SDI budget is finally set, but it
appears likely that Bush will have to settle for far less than he
wants. Congress' search for a ``peace dividend'' from the fading
Cold War makes Star Wars a fat target.
   ``SDI is a logical place to look'' for savings, says Rep.
Charles Bennett, D-Fla.
   Bennett, who says he favors continuing research and development
of SDI but not deployment, led a House charge last fall to cut the
project's budget below the administration's request. He said in an
interview that he intends to introduce an amendment this session to
limit 1991 SDI spending to perhaps $2.5 billion.
   Cheney said in a speech March 19 that the money crunch has put
SDI at a crossroads.
   ``We want to move forward. Our critics want to cut back. The
issue between us is almost entirely political,'' he said.
   Yet even some prominent Republicans are ruling out any increased
commitment to SDI.
   Sens. William Cohen of Maine and John McCain of Arizona,
prominent members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a
joint defense proposal April 5 that this year's $3.8 billion SDI
budget should be ``an upper limit to future funding levels.''
   The senators also called for reorienting the project away from
defending against an all-out Soviet attack.
   Monahan, director of the SDI project office in the Pentagon,
told a House panel on April 4 that the cost of deploying Star Wars
in its currently planned form is $55.3 billion, not adjusted for
the effects of inflation in the 1990s. He said that was down from
$69.1 billion estimated in October 1988 before the Pentagon decided
to use ``brilliant pebbles'' instead of larger, more costly
interceptors.
   Monahan predicted the figure would fall even further, but many
critics challenge his arithmetic.
   In his new book, ``Out of the Cold,'' Robert McNamara, who
served as defense secretary under former Presidents John Kennedy
and Lyndon Johnson, said Star Wars' price tag could spiral to
hundreds of billions of dollars, which he called ``an enormous
waste of resources.''
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the House Government
Operations Committee, cites a February report by the General
Accounting Office that estimates it will take $123 billion to
complete the current SDI plan, in addition to the roughly $19
billion that has been spent over the past seven years.
   ``With Eastern Europe shedding the yoke of communism, this
extraordinary expenditure of taxpayer dollars seems more absurd
then ever,'' Conyers said. ``We are talking about a stupendous cost
for a missile defense system that is only partially effective.''

   Here is the transcript of President Bush's
statement on the hostage release, read in Islamorada, Fla., on
Sunday by White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. Fitzwater's
own statement follows.
   President Bush:
   ``We are pleased at the news that Robert Polhill has been freed
by his captors. We are obviously happy for him, for his family and
for his friends.
   ``We also wish to thank those who had a hand in the release,
particularly the governments of Syria and Iran, whose efforts have
contributed to the release of this hostage.
   ``Our satisfaction at the release, however, is substantially
tempered by the knowledge that seven other innocent Americans, as
well as a number of foreign nations, are still being cruelly held
hostage in Lebanon.
   ``We cannot rest until all hostages are free. Once again we
urgently call on all parties who hold hostages or who have any
influence to work to obtain the immediate and unconditional release
of the remaining hostages as a humanitarian gesture.''

   Fitzwater's opening statement:
   ``The president was notified by General (Brent) Scowcroft at
approximately 12:45 (p.m.) today that there was a high probability
of the release of Robert Polhill. The general had received word of
the probable release from the White House situation room and
notified the president on his boat.
   ``At approximately 1:35 the president was notified that Robert
Polhill would be turned over to Ambassador Djerijian at
approximately 2:30 p.m. at the Syrian Foreign Ministry.
   ``President Bush talked directly to Ambassador Djerijian at the
U.S. Embassy in Damascus just prior to the ambassador's departure
for the foreign ministry.
   ``The president received a status report from the ambassador,
who said Mrs. Polhill is in Damascus to meet her husband. The
president may talk later today with either Robert Polhill or his
wife.
   ``The president and his fishing party, which includes Senator
(Alan) Simpson, Ambassador (Fred) Zeder, Secretary (Nicholas) Brady
and General Scowcroft, are fishing off the Florida Keys. The
presidential party has excellent ship-to-shore communication, and
General Scowcroft has been able to monitor this situation on a
continual basis.
   ``The president will return to Tarpon Flats this afternoon and
to Washington D.C. this evening. Mr. Polhill will be flown to the
U.S. Air Force hospital at Wiesbaden, West Germany, via a U.S.
military flight from Damascus, where he will be greeted by the
State Department Hostage Release Team. A U.S. aircraft has been
ordered to fly to Damascus from Turkey for that purpose.
   ``It is not known at this time how long Mr. Polhill will be in
Wiesbaden before he returns to the United States. The State
Department will do everything necessary to reunite the hostage with
family members as soon as appropriate.
   ``Any further details concerning the status of Mr. Polhill and
the circumstances of his release will be provided by the Department
of State.''

<HEAD>Los Angeles Mayor Battered But Politically Alive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Bradley is battered but politically
alive a year after the biggest mess of his long public career, but
problems may lie ahead.
   At one point, it was thought the 72-year-old mayor would be
lucky to keep his job through 1989 because of questions about his
finances and ethics.
   ``I would say that there has been irreparable damage to the
mayor's reputation,'' said Councilman Mike Woo. ``However, the
prophets of doom who predicted that Mayor Bradley would not last
out last year have clearly been wrong.''
   The trouble for Bradley started with reports he accepted $18,000
to serve as an adviser to Far East National Bank, which was doing
business with the city.
   With scandal in the air, Bradley narrowly avoided a runoff in
April 1989 and won an unprecedented fifth term. Over the next few
months, he was battered by allegations of unethical conduct,
culminating with an investigation by the city attorney.
   Bradley got more than a little help from the investigation,
which had bark but no legal bite, the demise of the Los Angeles
Herald Examiner, which had aggressively investigated him, and his
own perpetually pleasant personality.
   The mayor's aides contend he weathered the controversy because
he never did too much wrong in the first place and his problems
were overblown in the media.
   Still, Bradley paid a price. He disappointed even his strongest
supporters when he accepted the adviser fees, and hints are
circulating that retirement may be a good idea when his term ends
in 1993.
   ``This won't be a stain on his record,'' said labor leader Bill
Robertson, a longtime Bradley backer. ``He has enough time to make
some significant progress on his projects. I don't think anyone
would question his right to retire if he so chooses.''
   A federal grand jury continues to conduct what appears to be a
wide-ranging investigation of Bradley's finances, and a friend and
business partner of the mayor's has been charged with stealing
money from a city task force.
   Bradley would not comment at length on the events of the last
year, leaving _ as he usually does _ the talking to his aides.
   ``The mayor is a remarkable person in that he never wavers in
his day to day outlook,'' said chief of staff Mark Fabiani. ``He
stares straight ahead and moves straight down the road.''
   One chapter in the Bradley affair was closed this month when the
City Council allowed Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg to resign rather
than be fired. Rittenberg had taken much of the responsibility for
the mayor's problems.
   It was Rittenberg's office that had made a $2 million deposit
into the bank paying Bradley, then apparently tried to cover up the
transaction by putting white eraser fluid over the ledger entry
``per the mayor.''
   In the months after Bradley's near-miss with a runoff election a
year ago, a City Council committee held a series of dramatic
hearings that exposed wrongdoing, ineptitude and the apparent
cover-up in the treasurer's office.
   Most on everyone's mind was the release of the findings of City
Attorney James Hahn's investigation. Some City Hall observers
speculated at the time that a damaging report could abruptly end
the mayor's term.
   But when it was released in September, the report, although
critical of Bradley's alleged ethical lapses, found no grounds for
prosecution.
   Bradley agreed to pay $20,000 to settle allegations he failed to
report financial holdings amounting to $160,000, but he admitted no
wrongdoing.
   Although the report said the findings were not a vindication of
the mayor's conduct, Bradley declared otherwise.
   ``When all is said and done, the inquiry confirms what I have
said all along: I did not engage in conflicts of interest. I did
not violate the public's trust,'' he said.
   Still hanging over Bradley's head is the grand jury probe of his
business ties to eight banks, thrifts and brokerages. Under
scrutiny is possible insider trading and violation of federal laws
aimed at political corruption.
   Bradley's political allies also have run into trouble. Among
them, Juanita St. John, former head of the city's Task Force for
Africa-Los Angeles Relations, pleaded innocent this month to
embezzling nearly $200,000.

<HEAD>10 States Get Bulk of Direct Farmer Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A compilation of Agriculture Department
subsidies paid in 1989 shows 10 states accounted for about 60
percent of $10.9 billion in direct payments to farmers.
   The largest recipient was Texas, whose farmers received nearly
$1.25 billion. Iowa was next at $981.2 million, according to
figures provided by the department's Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service.
   Rounding out the top 10: Illinois, $725.9 million; Minnesota,
$599.9 million; Kansas, $587.3 million; Nebraska, $541.1 million;
Wisconsin, $522.3 million; North Dakota, $473.9 million; Arkansas,
$439.7 million; and California, $372.1 million.
   Payments to the 10 totaled approximately $6.49 billion and
included all major programs handled by ASCS such as ``deficiency''
payments for wheat, feed grains and cotton; emergency and disaster
assistance; and cost-sharing and annual rental under the
Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP.
   Collectively, the $10.9 billion paid to farmers last year was
down from about $14.5 billion in 1988 and the record $16.7 billion
in 1987. Department analysts say the payments will drop further in
1990.
   One factor has been the higher commodity prices that resulted
from the reduced production caused by drought the last two years.
With higher market prices, deficiency payments have been reduced.
   Among the programs administered by ASCS, feed grain deficiency
payments accounted for more than $3.1 billion of the 1989 total;
cotton, $1.18 billion; wheat, $602.9 million; and rice, $671
million.
   The CRP payments totaled $1.57 billion nationally, while
disaster payments added more than $2.7 billion.
   Farmers got $181.1 million under the old Agricultural
Conservation Program, or ACP; $11 million under a forestry
incentive program; about $8 million from the water bank to help
preserve wetlands; and almost $2.5 million to reduce Colorado River
salinity.
   The mix of payments in 1989 varied greatly among the states and
depended on the kind of crops and livestock operations involved.
   Cotton and rice are major crops in the South and California, but
not in the Corn Belt. Dairying is big in the upper Midwest and New
England, but often is far down the list in other states.
   For example, the $1.25 billion collected by Texas producers was
led by $416.1 million paid to as cotton deficiency payments, $164.1
million for feed grains, and $38.6 million for wheat.
   Texas also got $223.5 million in disaster payments and $156.4
million under the CRP. The state's total also included $50.1
million in wool and mohair subsidies.
   In Iowa, the runner-up, feed grain deficiency payments totaled
$577 million, while wheat was only $248,032 last year. Disaster
payments were $218.9 million, and CRP was $147.5 million. Iowans
collected $784,421 in wool payments.
   Kansas, traditionally the leading wheat producer, collected
$103.6 million in wheat deficiency payments. But that was second to
$164.9 million under the feed grain program. Disaster payments
totaled $147.8 million, and wool was shown at $592,653. The CRP
provided $154.1 million.
   No cotton payments were made in Kansas and Iowa.
   Total direct farm payments in calendar 1989 under USDA programs,
rounded, in dollars, for other states were:

   Gaylord Nelson, the founder of Earth Day two
decades ago, looked out at the thousands who gathered at the foot
of the Capitol and talked of the job yet to be done to save the
planet from pollution.
   ``I don't want to come back here 20 years from now and have to
tell your sons and daughters that you didn't do your duty,''
Nelson, 74, told the throng that gathered Sunday to join in the
worldwide 20th birthday of Earth Day.
   The daylong rally in the nation's capital was one of many across
the country and in 141 nations. ``The numbers are staggering,''
said Denis Hayes, organizer of the anniversary events, as the
people on the National Mall slowly began to scatter.
   He said indications were that as many as 225 million people took
part worldwide.
   According to the U.S. Capitol Police, more than 125,000 came to
the U.S. Capitol to hear a string of environmental activists,
politicians and celebrities call for grassroots action to protect
the environment.
   Thousands more strolled along other parts of the National Mall
and near an array of environmental exhibits, including a
25-foot-long section of a 7-foot-thick tree _ bought from a sawmill
in Washington state _ that dates back more than 700 years to the
days of Marco Polo. It once was among the old-growth forests of the
Northwest that environmentalists are trying to preserve.
   ``On Earth Day 1990 we hear the voice of the planet and demand
that she be healed,'' declared Hayes, chairman of Earth Day '90
Inc., the group that led the $3 million effort to remember the
original Earth Day two decades ago.
   Several environmental activists blasted President Bush for
staying away from the rally and going fishing in Florida instead.
``Where is the president today? He's gone fishing!'' railed Ruth
Caplan, executive director of the Environmental Action Foundation.
   Bush returned to Washington late Sunday from Florida, where he
met with founders of a Key West group, Reef Relief, which he
singled out for its efforts to protect the coral reefs.
   Young people pushed against the barriers near the stage for a
closer glimpse at celebrities such as actors Tom Cruise and Richard
Gere and recording artist John Denver. Further away people, many in
shorts and t-shirts, strolled in the warm sun.
   ``We must change things. We must pressure our political
leaders,'' declared Cruise, who portrayed Vietnam veteran activist
Ron Kovic in the movie ``Born on the Fourth of July.''
   Fifteen-year-old Mariah Bauer said she hadn't yet seen Cruise or
any of the other celebrities, but was glad she had come.
   ``We wanted to help save the Earth, to do our part,'' she said.
   To Becky Lopez, 15, and Sonja Goepfert, 20, it was largely a day
of work. Wearing yellow rubber gloves, they were among about 200
volunteers who collected trash discarded by the crowd into paper
collection bags and separated it for recycling.
   ``Our aim is to get 95 percent of the trash here recycled,''
said Goepfert.
   Farther down the Mall, Margaret Shumaker, a mother of three,
could barely hear the speeches and songs as she changed the diapers
of Noah, 1, using cloth diapers instead of the plastic disposables
disliked by many environmentalists because they do not degrade in
landfills.
   ``We wouldn't show up without them (the cloth diapers),'' said
Debbie Wills. ``We couldn't show our faces.''
   What brought the group to the rally?
   ``Because we like the Earth,'' said Zachary Shumaker, 7.

<HEAD>Pope Says Church has Key Role in Shaping a Unified Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II used a historic visit to
Czechoslovakia to call for an unprecedented European-wide meeting
of bishops, and said on his way home that he wants his church to
play a key role in shaping a new Europe.
   ``The church has something to say and something to give'' as
former Communist countries in Eastern Europe move toward democracy
and freedom of worship, the pope said Sunday night as he returned
to Rome.
   A Vatican spokesman also announced that the pope has accepted an
invitation to visit Cuba in December.
   The pontiff said he hoped his 2-day visit to Czechoslovakia
``can open new doors to relations between the East and West and
toward European unification.'' It was his first trip to a Warsaw
Pact country other than his native Poland.
   He called the meeting, or synod, of Europe's nearly 1,000
bishops _ out of 3,000 worldwide _ to discuss spreading the
church's message across a continent transformed by the toppling of
Communist regimes.
   The synod will apparently map a church strategy to meet the
pope's vision of a Europe that is united on the basis of its
Christian roots and whose peoples reject materialistic tendencies
in favor of spiritual values.
   No date or location was specified for the gathering.
   At an outdoor Mass which drew several hundred thousand faithful
on a rain-drenched field in the Slovak capital of Bratislava on
Sunday, the pope lauded the perseverance of the country's
long-suppressed Roman Catholics.
   He also gave special thanks to Czechoslovakia's youth, who
sparked the peaceful November revolution that toppled the former
Communists rulers of a country that is two-thirds Catholic.
   ``I am thinking of the young people, whom others tried to lead
astray, but who did not lose their thirst for truth, justice and
love, and who, in the light of such values, became the agents of
recent changes,'' he said.
   The 69-year-old pope made his announcement of a European synod
as he visited a Moravian shrine in the city of Velehrad, 90 miles
from Bratislava. The shrine was dedicated to Cyril and Methodius,
two patron saints of Europe.
   ``We could find no better occasion for an announcement that
intimately concerns this continent, which throughout the centuries
has been torn by wars, but also blessed with a presence and work of
countless saints who sowed the gospel seeds far and wide,'' he said.
   John Paul said the synod would be held ``at a not-too-distant
date.'' But a papal spokesman, Joaquin Navarro, said the meeting
probably would not be held this year. He said details would be
announced in Rome on Tuesday.
   ``To my mind the agenda for the synod will be huge,'' Navarro
said. ``It will be the first such European church summit bringing
together bishops from every country on the continent.''
   Since European Communist regimes started crumbling last year,
the Vatican has been moving quickly to expand its influence in the
region.
   Poland was the first to restore diplomatic relations with the
Holy See. That country's first post-war non-communist premier,
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, attended the papal Mass in Velehrad and kissed
the pontiff's ring.
   After celebrating a Mass at Velehrad attended by some 200,000
people, the pope flew on to Bratislava for another huge open-air
service that was the final big event of his trip.
   At that Mass was Deputy Prime Minister Jan Carnogursky, a Slovak
and the emerging leader of the increasingly ambitious Christian
Democratic Movement which is expected to do well in parliamentary
elections set for June 8-9.
   The movement was expected to reap political benefits from the
pope's visit, and Carnogursky even read during the Mass.
   Also prominent at the service was parliament Speaker Alexander
Dubcek, the former Communist Party leader whose 1968 ``Prague
Spring'' reforms prompted the Warsaw Pact invasion of
Czechoslovakia and a restoration of hard-line policies.
   The Vatican estimates 10.7 million Catholics live in the country
of 15.6 million.
   The trip was the pope's 46th foreign tour. Next month, he is
scheduled to visit Mexico and Malta and he plans a tour of Africa
in September and a stop in Cuba in December.

   Police officers posing as taxi drivers are
cruising for the killers of seven cabbies.
   With the slaying of two drivers over the weekend, Mayor David
Dinkins ordered police to step up the investigation into the
killings. As part of the police probe, undercover officers are
working as cab drivers.
   The body of the sixth driver killed in the Bronx since March 7
was found Sunday, and another driver was shot to death in Brooklyn
on Saturday.
   After meeting Sunday with Police Commissioner Lee Brown, Dinkins
called the seven slayings ``a public crisis'' and ``a threat to the
entire city.''
   Police have said they believe one killer was responsible for
three of the slayings in the Bronx. They were investigating whether
the two weekend deaths might also be related.
   ``Certainly there's some similarities,'' Lt. Donald F.
Stephenson said of Sunday's shooting.
   The victim had been shot in the head. The man, whose name was
not released was believed to be a gypsy driver, or one who
illegally picks up passengers on the street. Only medallion cabs,
or yellow cabs, may do that.
   On Saturday afternoon, a gypsy cab driver, Ferdinand ``Charlie''
Jeannot, was shot in Brooklyn through a plastic partition by a
backseat passenger, police said. They speculated the gunman may
have planned to rob Jeannot but couldn't reach his wallet
containing $100 because the front doors were locked.
   The three related shootings in the Bronx, all within a mile,
involved drivers who were called late at night to pick up a
passenger, police said. Ballistics tests have shown the bullets
were from the same .22-caliber gun. Police think robbery was the
motive.
   The mayor said in ordered Brown to expand a 30-member task force
assigned to find the killer or killers.
   ``These killings represent more than a brutal attack on the
drivers who have fallen victim,'' Dinkins said. ``They have also
become an assault on a vital link in our transportation system.''
   Non-medallion cabs are used most often by people in upper
Manhattan and the outer boroughs, where yellow cabs are hard to
find.
   At least 32 cabbies were killed on the job last year. So far
this year, nine cab drivers have been slain.
   A reward of $20,000 has been offered for information about the
Bronx cabbies' killer or killers.

   A gaunt, pale Robert Polhill was freed
Sunday by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants in Beirut after 1,182
days as a hostage, and he said his anger kept him alive.
   The Iranian foreign minister was quoted as saying the Shiite
movements in Lebanon wanted a prompt reciprocal move for freeing
Polhill, but President Bush said he would make no deals with the
kidnappers.
   An Iranian newspaper close to Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani said Monday that the Lebanese kidnappers should release
another American hostage immediately without conditions.
   Polhill was the first American hostage to be released in nearly
3{ years.
   Polhill, 55, of New York, was freed near the seaside Summerland
Hotel in Moslem west Beirut at 5:15 p.m. (11:15 a.m. EDT) and
driven immediately to Damascus where he was turned over to U.S.
Ambassador Edward Djerejian.
   ``I want to tell you I'm a very happy man tonight,'' Polhill
told a news conference in Damascus, looking dazed but elated. ``I'm
am sorry I kept you waiting so long. Thirty-nine months is a long
time.''
   On Monday, he and his Lebanese wife, Feryal, flew from the
Syrian capital in a U.S. Air Force C-141 plane to Rhein-Main air
base just outside Frankfurt, West Germany.
   At the base, he was helped down stairs from the plane by two
men, waved to reporters and was escorted to an olive green military
van.
   Polhill was then to head by helicopter to nearby Wiesbaden,
where he was to undergo medical checks and a debriefing by U.S.
intelligence officers at a U.S. military hospital before returning
to the United States.
   Other American captives freed in the past have also gone there.
   Bush thanked Syria and Iran for their roles in freeing Polhill,
and called for the release of all the hostages. He said the United
States would make no deals with hostage takers.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, was quoted early
Monday as saying the pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon wanted a
quick reciprocal move. The official Syrian Arab News Agency,
quoting Velayati in New York, specified the release of Sheik Abdul
Karim Obeid, a Lebanese Shiite clergyman, abducted by Israeli
soldiers in July.
   Seventeen Western hostages remain missing in Lebanon, including
seven Americans. Polhill, a professor of business studies and
accounting at Beirut University College, and two other U.S.
educators, Jesse Turner and Alann Steen, were held by the Islamic
Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine.
   In a Syrian TV interview, Polhill said he was grateful to those
who helped him, but added: ``I'm still deeply concerned about my
two friends and others who are still held in the conditions I was
held in.''
   Polhill said he played cards with other hostages during his
captivity and tried to keep his mind off the possibility of freedom.
   ``I strived to continue to be angry, knowing at all times that
if I began to lose that anger I would just sort of become a
vegetable and I didn't want that to happen,'' he said in the
interview.
   The terms of the release, which followed a series of communiques
from the Shiite Moslem kidnappers, were not known.
   Guards outside the Summerland who witnessed the release said
Polhill stepped out of a car that screeched to a halt about 50
yards from the hotel.
   He was immediately picked up by a three-car Syrian convoy and
driven off at high speed.
   The Syrian TV footage showed Polhill being driven through
Beirut, sitting in the back of a car and puffing heavily on a
cigarette. He appeared drawn after his long ordeal and smiled wanly
several times.
   At his news conference, Polhill, gaunt and pale, said he was too
tired to answer any questions about seven other American hostages
or his captivity by the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine since Jan. 24, 1987.
   Standing beside Polhill, Djerejian said: ``We will keep
communication lines open to all parties that have influence with
the hostage takers. We are going to continue doing everything we
can, we are going to continue talking, to continue trying.''
   Also speaking at the news conference, Syria's foreign minister,
Farouk al-Sharaa, said he hoped Polhill's release will lead to
other hostage releases.
   In an editorial in Monday's editions, the Tehran Times newspaper
said another hostage should be freed to test `President Bush's
claim that `goodwill begets goodwill.'''
   ``This they should do swiftly in order to leave the ball in the
other party's court to demonstrate its goodwill, if it has any,''
said the English-language newspaper, which often reflects
Rafsanjani's views.
   Bush, on a fishing trip in Florida, said all American hostages
must be free before the United States will reciprocate with a
goodwill gesture.
   ``I don't trade for hostages,'' he said.
   Polhill's mother, Ruth Polhill of Fishkill, N.Y., was overjoyed
at news of the release and the prospect of seeing her son.
   ``Maybe I'll have control of myself by that time,'' she told CNN.
   Polhill and Steen, a native of Boston who turned 51 on Sunday,
and Turner, 42, of Boise, Idaho, were kidnapped from the Beirut
University College campus by gunmen disguised as police officers.
   The last American hostage to be freed was David Jacobsen, former
director of the American University Hospital in Beirut. He was
kidnapped in Beirut on May 28, 1985, was released Nov. 2, 1986.
   He had been held by another Shiite faction, Islamic Jihad, or
Isamic Holy War.
   In Libya Sunday, Col. Moammar Gadhafi also called for the
release of hostages in an appeal to Moslems around the world, the
official Libyan news agency JANA said.
   The first word of an impending hostage release came Wednesday,
when the kidnappers announced they would free one captive in 48
hours.
   But on Thursday, the captors indefinitely postponed the release
after Bush refused to send John Kelly, assistant secretary of state
for Near East affairs, to Damascus as the kidnappers had demanded.
   Syria, as it moves back to the Arab mainstream after years of
isolation, apparently wants to improve its image in the West and
hopes that mediating the release of U.S. hostages will persuade the
United States to eventually take it off the list of countries
sponsoring terrorism.
   In Iran, Rafsanjani and some of the more pragmatic politicians
are apparently want to improve ties with the West.
   The longest held Western hostage is Terry A. Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Bush-Mitterrand Meeting an Exercise in Presidential Body Language</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMORADA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rooted beneath the buzzing blades of a
Marine helicopter, President Bush gave some anxious moments to
Secret Service agents whose job it is to protect him.
   One White House staffer joked afterward that it was the closest
Vice President Dan Quayle had ever come to being president.
   The setting was the landing strip where Bush bade farewell to
visiting French President Francois Mitterrand after a day of talks
at nearby Key Largo.
   Bush's limousine pulled up right next to the waiting helicopter,
and the two leaders emerged and shook hands.
   When Mitterrand climbed aboard the helicopter, Bush stepped back
about 10 feet and planted himself behind his armored car.
   The helicopter pilot delayed starting his engine, waiting for
Bush to leave. But the president didn't move.
   Finally, the aircraft's huge blades began turning, faster and
faster, throwing out great gusts of wind.
   Bush held his ground, leaning forward against the storm-like
weather, clutching a strap inside the car for balance.
   A Secret Service agent next to Bush suggested he get in the
limo. The president ignored him. The agent tried again. Same
response.
   Bush seemed oblivious to the noise, the wind and any danger.
   With his hair blowing and sport coat flapping in the wind, he
waved repeatedly to Mitterrand until the helicopter finally climbed
into the air and took him away.
   Seeming exhilarated, Bush got in his car and left.
   Helicopter drama aside, Bush's meeting with Mitterrand provided
an extraordinary look at an array of presidential body language.
   After hours of talks, they appeared together on an outdoor stage
for a news conference.
   Bush opened with an eight-minute statement. He stopped every few
moments to allow the remarks to be translated into French.
   When it was his turn, Mitterrand droned on for 21 minutes,
including translation. And when it came time for the questions and
answers, the French leader was always more long-winded than Bush.
   It clearly put Bush's patience to a test.
   He fidgeted and rubbed his jaw. He grimaced and set his teeth in
a smile. Several times, Bush twisted around to the back of stage as
if to seek relief from his press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater,
standing nearby.
   Bush occasionally caught the eye of reporters in the audience
who made no attempt to hide their distress at Mitterrand's
soliloquies. Bush smiled and lowered his eyes.
   Fitzwater later described the session as the longest
presidential news conference in memory: a full 72 minutes. In fact,
he ducked out early on to smear on some suntan lotion.
   The next day, Bush boasted about his endurance.
   ``I was very polite,'' the president said. ``I was thinking of
(media adviser) Roger Ailes _ keep eye contact.''
   The day after Mitterrand left, Bush settled into Islamorada for
a weekend of fishing. He didn't do very well the first day but said
he fared better the second day. He offered no specifics.
   While the fish may have avoided the president, the tourists
didn't.
   When Bush strolled onto a beach at sunrise on Earth Day for an
environmental ceremony on Sunday, he was greeted by two women
humming ``Hail to the Chief.''
   Bush smiled at the familiar strain and said, ``Thank you.'' He
added for the benefit of other onlookers, ``The Marine Band is over
there.''
   It was a spur-of-the-moment performance, the women said
afterward.
   ``If I had planned it, I would have brought kazoos from school,
but I didn't think far enough in advance,'' said Barbara Wilt, 38,
an elementary school music teacher from Orlando.
   Sarah Seay, 42, of Altamont Springs, Fla., asked Bush afterward,
``How did you like our singing?''
   ``He just looked and went `WAHHHH,''' she laughed, pantomiming
Bush shaking his hand in a so-so gesture.

<HEAD>Restive Latin American Voters Dump Incumbents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega steps
down on Wednesday he will join a rapidly growing but still
exclusive club.
   Over the past year and a half, wrathful voters in about a dozen
Latin American countries have rebelled against their declining
living standards by voting incumbent parties out of office. In
Nicaragua, voters repudiated the revolutionary left. Elsewhere,
more moderate parties were turned out of power.
   In some ways, the ``throw the bums out'' mentality in Latin
America parallels what occurred last year in Eastern Europe.
   In both regions, the trend generally has been toward reducing
the state role in the economy and adoption of free market
principles.
   But the political upheaval in Latin America has been far less
dramatic than in the East bloc. It has taken place not on the
streets but in the quiet of the voting booth.
   Ortega's defeat by Violeta Chamorro on Feb. 25 was just the
latest example of Central American voters opting for the more
conservative alternative. The pattern has been similar in elections
in El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica over the past year.
   In South America, similar examples can be cited in Brazil and
Uruguay. In the recent election in Peru, the large majority of the
votes went to either centrist or rightist candidates, leaving the
nominee of the ruling center-left party trailing badly.
   In Chile, despite high economic growth rates, voters turned
against 15 years of military rule in 1988. The country's newly
elected leadership has promised not to tamper significantly with
the conservative economic policies of the previous government.
   In Venezuela, Argentina, Ecuador and Jamaica, the presidents
were elected as populists but are pursuing economic policies that
are far more conservative than what they promised during the
campaign.
   In Mexico, the Partido Revolucionario Institucional is still in
charge but not without receiving a scare from the voters two years
ago.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is winning praise from
Washington for his efforts to revitalize the Mexican economy
through market-oriented approaches.
   Throughout the hemisphere, there is a recognition that the
traditional way of doing things hasn't worked.
   Eva Loser, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, says there is a widespread tendency ``to
throw out what they've been doing and try something new.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has hailed the restoration
of democracy in the hemisphere but says that breakthrough will be
meaningless unless it leads to improved living standards.
   Economists look on the 1980s in Latin America as ``the lost
decade,'' a time when production, investment and consumption all
dropped. The number of Latin Americans in absolute poverty is
believed to be far above 100 million.
   In 1988, combined inflation in Latin America was 420 percent.
When Peruvians went to the polls several weeks ago, prices were
soaring at an annual rate of almost 3,000 percent.
   Some countries have had to earmark up to half their export
earnings for foreign debt payments. The declining economies in many
countries were the result of rock-bottom prices for export
commodities.
   That is a problem local governments cannot influence, but other
maladies are home-grown.
   Douglas Payne, director of hemispheric affairs for Freedom
House, a pro-democracy group based in New York, said economic
stagnation in the hemisphere is partly the result of ``monopoly,
regulation and protectionism.''
   More recently, he said, these problems have been compounded by
``interventionist development policies that created huge,
money-guzzling state corporations and corrupt no-work
bureaucracies.''
   One of the more interesting contests shaping up in the short
term is expected within the next year in Guyana.
   There, the moderate ruling party will be squaring off against a
party led by an old-line Marxist, Cheddi Jagan, who, for now, is
the favorite to win.

<HEAD>VA Committees Calling For Expanded College Benefit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The non-stop rise in college tuition, coupled
with the prospect of major cuts in America's troop strength, is
prompting calls for expanded benefits under veterans' educational
program known as the Montgomery GI Bill.
   The congressional committees that deal with veteran affairs
recently recommended that Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski
propose raising the maximum monthly GI Bill benefit.
   The Pentagon and armed services groups are looking at how the
program can help ease the impact of demobilization on service
members who had planned on a military career.
   Since 1985, the monthly benefit for veterans who pursue fulltime
study has stood at $300 for a maximum 36 months. Tuition at public
institutions has risen 6 percent to 7 percent annually since then
and is expected to keep rising, the Pentagon says.
   Tuition for all higher-education institutions, including
two-year colleges, cost $6,800 in 1988, the Department of Education
says.
   If the program were indexed, the benefit would be $464 monthly,
says Richard L. Johnson of the Non Commissioned Officers
Association. His figure is based on a Pentagon test program.
   Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, chairman of the House Veterans
Affairs Committee, asked the VA in a letter March 26 to raise the
monthly benefit under his namesake bill to $400 in fiscal 1992. The
Senate VA Committee gave no dollar figure in its budget
recommendation.
   Johnson says the benefits are becoming more critical because of
Pentagon plans to cut military strength. The Army, where GI Bill
enrollment is the highest, would drop from 764,000 to 580,000
members by 1997 under the latest Pentagon plan.
   ``The big concern I have is when we look back through 1970 to
1975, we had a GI Bill that could reasonably support an individual
who had a wife and child,'' said Johnson. That would be impossible
now, he said.
   Under the GI Bill then in place, the last wartime- and draft-era
bill, the benefit for a veteran with no dependents rose from $130 a
month in 1967 to $342 in January 1981. Veterans with dependents
received more.
   Usage for any GI Bill since the program began after World War II
peaked in 1976 when 2.8 million people received training, most in
college.
   Johnson's concern has also been expressed in the Pentagon, where
Lt. Col. Otis Elam says ``we've been looking at that very hard.''
His concern is with the longer-term service member.
   ``When they get out they may not have a job opportunity and may
need benefits for school,'' said Elam, associate director for
education and officer procurement policy in the Defense Department.
   Paradoxically, a program that was tailored to attract
high-quality recruits and keep them in the service will have to be
used to ease people out. And no one has any idea what impact
demobilization will have on the present budget projections for the
program.
   The Reagan administration had tried to end the program in its
1987 budget proposal, substituting an earlier, less popular
peacetime version. The administration said at the time the bill had
achieved its purpose.
   The Montgomery GI Bill took form amid a debate over how to
restore the strength and quality of the armed services. Because of
that concern, the program has incentives for staying in the
active-duty military or reserves.
   Under the Montgomery Bill, service members are automatically
enrolled unless they elect to opt out within two weeks after
entering the service. Participants have $100 a month deducted from
their pay for the first 12 months of service, which they do not get
back if they do not go to school after leaving the service.
   As a result of these deductions, the Pentagon has saved $1
billion in payroll costs since July 1985. The benefits, the bulk of
which come out of the VA budget, are only now beginning to be paid
in large numbers.
   The VA has predicted that usage of the $300 monthly benefit will
peak in 1995 and that from then to the turn of the century nearly
250,000 participants will collect about $500 million dollars each
year _ or about $1,900 each.

   This is how the Montgomery GI Bill works.
There are two components of the program: the active duty, or
Chapter 30; and the Selected Reserve-National Guard, or Chapter 106.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ACTIVE DUTY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Basic Readjustment Benefit: $300 a month for 36 months for
fulltime study, based on three years of active duty or two years of
active duty combined with four years in the Reserve or National
Guard; or $250 a month for 36 months based on two years of active
duty. This benefit is paid out of the budget for the Department of
Veterans Affairs.
   Types of training covered include: college or
vocational-technical programs, on-the-job and apprentice training,
correspondence courses, remedial courses and tutoring, and flight
training under a test program from October 1990 to September 1994.
   Eligibility: Enter active duty after June 30, 1985, and serve
two years of continuous active duty. High school diploma or
equivalent. Graduates of service academies and recipients of ROTC
scholarships are ineligible.
   Participation: Service members are automatically enrolled upon
enlistment. They have 14 days in which to decline to participate.
   Cost: Those who enroll have their pay reduced for $100 a month
during the first year of service. This money is non-refundable
except in special cases.
   Time limit: Must be used within 10 years of veteran's last
discharge or release from active duty. May be used while service
member still in military.
   Other benefits: The Defense Department pays a combination of
``kicker'' and supplemental benefits to fill shortages in critical
skill areas. For people making a longer-term commitment to the
military, these payments can bring the benefit up to $1,300 a month.

   Robert Polhill's mother was overcome with joy when he was
released after more than three years as a hostage in Lebanon, but
the news was bittersweet for other relatives whose loved ones
remained captive.
   ``I'm overjoyed, happy,'' Ruth Polhill said Sunday upon learning
her son had been set free in Beirut by his pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem captors. ``But I'm sad for the families of the other
hostages.''
   Polhill, 55, a professor from New York City, was the first
American released in nearly 3{ years. He was flown to West Germany
early today for debriefing and a medical exam before returning to
the United States.
   He had been held with Alann Steen and Jesse Turner since their
abduction from Beirut University College on Jan. 24, 1987.
   Until Sunday, it hadn't been clear which of the three held by
the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine would be
released. The news that it was Polhill was bittersweet for Turner's
68-year-old mother, Estelle Ronneburg of Boise, Idaho.
   Mrs. Ronneburg's hopes were raised Wednesday by the release of a
photo of her son along with an announcement that an American would
be set free. But Islamic Jihad's announcement Thursday that it was
postponing the release was accompanied by a photo of Polhill.
   ``It can't help but hurt a little bit because I had high
hopes,'' Mrs. Ronneburg said. ``But I am very happy for Mrs.
Polhill. I know how she feels. She's getting her son back. I'm sure
she's overjoyed.''
   Steen's wife, Virginia Rose Steen, said she was thrilled by
Polhill's release.
   ``I hope this will be the beginning of the end for all hostages
and they will all come home,'' Mrs. Steen, 33, said outside her
parents' home in Clarklake, Mich.
   Relatives of the other U.S. hostages in Lebanon also expressed
optimism.
   ``I think it was good news for all the hostage families,'' said
Peggy Say, whose brother, Associated Press chief Middle East
correspondent Terry Anderson, has been held for five years, longer
than any other U.S. hostage.
   Say, interviewed by telephone from her home in Cadiz, Ky., said
she hoped ``with the cooperation of Iran and Syria and the U.S.
that, God willing, the rest will come out in short order.''
   ``It's given us a lot of encouragement,'' said Thomas Cicippio
of Norristown, Pa., whose brother, Joseph, has been held since
Sept. 12, 1986 ``I really feel this is the beginning of the release
of all the other hostages.''
   Mrs. Polhill, an 85-year-old widow, said from her home in
Fishkill, N.Y., that she never lost hope her son would be freed.
``I can't understand it, but I haven't faltered at all,'' she said.
   The last American to be freed was David Jacobsen, former
director of the American University Hospital in Beirut. He was
kidnapped in Beirut on May 28, 1985, and was released Nov. 2, 1986.
   He had been held by another Shiite faction, Islamic Jihad, or
Islamic Holy War.

   An army of census workers is about to start
chasing answers from millions of Americans, a task that in past
years occasionally meant fleeing from dogs and goats, changing
diapers and helping hang wash.
   ``It's never routine, knocking door-to-door,'' says Fred Borsa,
the man in charge of training the 330,000 census workers who will
hit the streets on Thursday.
   Goats, bulls, dogs and roosters are among the animals that have
routed the citizen-counters in the past.
   But pleasant experiences occur also. For example, one census
worker reported that while she was interviewing the residents of a
household the family cat brought her four kittens into the room and
placed them at the feet of the enumerator.
   Animals aren't included in the census, but the bureau does want
to count the millions of Americans who haven't returned their
census forms _ whether they were lost, ignored or never arrived.
   The bureau has faced a barrage of criticism in recent weeks
following reports that whole towns failed to receive the forms
mailed out in late March. Some 4.8 million forms were
undeliverable. In addition, people who did get forms have not
responded as well as the bureau hoped.
   As a result, the cost of taking the census is expected to run
$150 million to $190 million above estimates, as more people must
be hired for the door-to-door count. The canvass had been expected
to cost $1.3 billion.
   Past census workers have found people living in converted
chicken coops, tin huts, old boxcars, mine tunnels and lofts. Most
folks are cooperative, according to workers in previous counts.
   Workers have helped with babies and washing, fought fires and
discovered sick elderly people who had to be taken to hospitals.
   Census workers are told to leave the area if trouble arises. But
most people cooperate once a census enumerator gets to the front
door, Borsa said, although they don't always want to let a worker
indoors.
   ``Sometimes people won't let you in the house, and there you
are, standing in the rain, trying to conduct an interview,'' he
explained.
   Borsa recalled an incident involving an irate woman in
Albuquerque. She was upset that her husband was unemployed and she
didn't see how answering census questions was going to do her any
good, he said.
   ``The enumerator took some time, was very patient. She explained
the benefits to the local community, how it was important for
people to cooperate,'' he said. After a few minutes the woman
decided to talk and provided the requested information.
   It's not unusual for workers to get invited into people's homes
for dinner, the bureau reports.
   The bureau tries to hire people to work in their home towns and
even in their home apartment buildings where possible, Borsa said.
Local people are more readily trusted, he explained, and know their
way around a neighborhood.
   Census workers get two and one-half days of training including
some field practice before being sent out on their own, Borsa said.
   Patience and resilience can be important qualities for a census
worker.
   In one instance a census worker climbed onto the porch of a farm
home and asked the resident if the house needed any repairs.
Promptly, the porch collapsed around her.
   One woman told a census worker it was her first visitor in two
years.
   When people refuse to cooperate, the enumerator's crew leader
makes one last attempt to get an interview, said Borsa.
   Then, if all else fails, they talk to neighbors and record what
they can observe from outside about how many people seem to be in
the residence.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Democrats Offer `Budget Lite'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When House Speaker Thomas S. Foley and his
Democratic team marched into the news conference to announce their
budget, everything was in place _ the cameras, the press releases,
the package of rhetoric.
   Everything, that is, except the budget. As planned.
   The Democrats didn't hold their news conference last week to
give detailed designs for how the government could operate better
next year.
   For years they'd said their budgets were superior to the
Reagan-Bush blueprints, with lower deficits and more innovative
programs. But the public still believed the Republicans were more
trustworthy keepers of the federal balance sheet.
   This time the Democrats weren't going to get bogged down
explaining the arcane details. The White House realized years ago
that nobody outside Washington cares about that stuff.
   So, budget not in hand, the Democrats announced their plan was
``the rebuild America budget,'' ``a budget with vision,'' and that,
in contrast with President Bush's plan, it ``invests in the
economic strength of America and our working families.''
   After Foley, D-Wash., and the other party leaders left, House
Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta explained how that worked.
Bush's defense budget would be cut and the money spent instead on
welfare programs, education, job training, etc. _ in short,
traditional Democratic Party priorities.
   Panetta released the actual budget the following day and,
without fanfare, it was passed by his committee on a party-line
vote. Full House debate is expected to start late this week.
   The news conference Wednesday was only the first step in the
Democrats' long-range media strategy for their budget, which most
expect will ultimately be reduced to a bargaining position for
talks with Bush.
   ``The budget left to its own devices is an impenetrable
subject,'' says David Dreyer, communications director for House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   The group of Democrats organized by Gephardt to criticize the
president regularly on such issues as foreign policy and the
environment will add the budget to their repertoire. The key
message: the changes in Eastern Europe mean it's now prudent to
trim military spending for America's needs, and Bush is behind the
curve.
   That the budget is a political battle is nothing new. But in the
past it has been treated as the most serious and weighty of tasks _
Sisyphus pushing the boulder up the hill, each step a hurdle.
   House Democrats decided this year to play down the tedious
manufacturing process and instead present the public with a
product. A sort of Budget Lite, easier to digest.
   ``We've been thinking like that all year,'' said one top
leadership aide. ``It's a realization with everything we do, we
have to be able to tell a story to the American people.''
   There's no way that the congressional Democrats can command news
media coverage the way the White House can.
   The president dominates coverage when he releases his budget.
And Bush needs only to hint at a change in one of his budget
stances, such as a tax increase, and he's got international
attention with financial markets moving.
   By contrast, last week's Democratic budget, undoubtedly closer
than Bush's proposal will be to the final fiscal 1991 plan,
garnered little time on radio and television and few big headlines.
   But the Democrats are willing to take what they can get and are
willing to change the way things are done to get it, in hopes of a
long-term payoff.
   ``I'd rather take a balanced story on page 13 than a blast on
page one,'' said the leadership aide, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``The onus is on us,'' Dreyer said.

<HEAD>Blacks Twice as Likely as Whites to be Robbery Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks are more likely than whites to be
victims of violent crimes such as aggravated assault, rape and
robbery, according to a federal study.
   The rate of such violent crimes occurring against black
Americans age 12 or older was 44 per 1,000 compared with 34 per
1,000 whites in the same age group, according to data collected by
the Justice Department's National Crime Survey between 1979 and
1986.
   There were 13 robberies per 1,000 blacks during the seven-year
period, compared with five robberies per 1,000 whites, the study
said. The rate of aggravated assaults was 14 per 1,000 blacks and 9
per 1,000 whites. There were 1.5 rapes per 1,000 black women,
compared with 0.8 rapes per 1,000 white women.
   Whites were more likely to be victims of simple assault with a
rate of 19 per 1,000 compared to 16 simple assaults per 1,000
blacks.
   Blacks were more likely to be physically attacked or threatened
with violence than whites during the commission of a crime, the
study said.
   Among victims of aggravated assault, 48 percent were black,
while 41 percent were white.
   In addition, blacks were more likely to be attacked by someone
holding a knife, gun or some other weapon.
   The statistics gathered from the survey showed that 48 percent
of black victims of violent crimes reported facing an armed
attacker, compared with 33 percent of the white victims of those
crimes.
   The injury rate for black victims of aggravated assault also was
higher than for whites. Twenty-four percent of black victims,
compared with 16 percent of whites, sustained serious injuries such
as knife wounds, bullet wounds or broken bones.
   Whites were more likely to be attacked and injured during
robberies than blacks. Thirty-four percent of white robbery victims
were injured, compared with 28 percent of blacks.
   But blacks were more likely to be severely injured. Sixty-one
percent of black victims who were injured received medical
treatment, compared with 46 percent of injured white victims.
   The overnight hospitalization rate for injured black victims was
8 percent, compared with 4 percent among whites.
   The data was collected from the nationwide survey of 50,000
households conducted every six months by the department. Members of
each household are asked if they have been victims of crimes during
the previous six months.
   The survey does not include murder statistics. But the report
contained FBI crime statistics for 1986 showing that the murder
rate among blacks was 31.2 per 100,000 compared with 5.4 per
100,000 whites.
   The rate among black males was 52.3 per 100,000 compared with
7.9 per 100,000 white men.

   Here are some facts and figures on Nigeria:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND: Stretching inland from the rain-swept West African
coastline to arid lands on the edge of the Sahara Desert, Nigeria
covers 356,600 square miles, about the land area of Texas and Utah
combined.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE: The population is estimated at more than 100
million, Africa's most populous. Moslems predominate in the north
and a Christian majority is in the south. Dozens of languages are
spoken among the more than 250 tribes. The main ones are Hausa,
spoken in the north, Yoruba in the southwest and Ibo in the east.
English is the lingua franca.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY: At independence from Britain in 1960, agriculture
was the most important industry. Oil became the major source of
income in the 1970s, but falling prices in the early 1980s, coupled
with mismanagement and corruption, brought a sharp economic decline.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE HISTORY: Nigeria's many peoples were brought together
arbitrarily under the flag of British colonialism in a union
plagued to this day by tribal conflicts. In the 1967-69 Biafran
War, the Ibo tribe tried to secede and form the state of Biafra in
eastern Nigeria. More than 500,000 civilians and 100,000 soldiers
died before the easterners succumbed. The last civilian president,
Shehu Shagari, was overthrown by Gen. Muhammadu Buhari in December
1983. Buhari was ousted by the present leader, Gen. Ibrahim
Babangida, Aug. 27, 1987.

<BYLINE>Brain-Dead Infant Gives Life to Twin Sister

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Timothy and Paula Whisman thought their
hands would be full with two demanding infants by now. Instead,
their arms are aching to hold one newborn daughter, who clings to
life because of her twin brother's heart.
   Alison Page Whisman was born April 10 with a fatal heart
condition. Her brother, Tyler, was born brain dead minutes later.
Doctors saved the girl's life by giving her Tyler's heart in what
they believe is the first heart transplant between infant twins.
   ``We just want to have her where we can hold her and feed her
and all those things that you do with a baby,'' Mrs. Whisman said.
``I just want to get her where I can have some snugglies.''
   Page _ as her parents call her _ is in the newborn intensive
care unit at Riley Hospital for Children. She is hooked to a
heart-lung monitor.
   Dr. Randall Caldwell, medical director of the Riley pediatric
cardiac transplantation program, said Page had hypoplastic left
heart syndrome, a fatal congenital abnormality that occurs in about
one in 6,000 births.
   Without help, infants with the condition die within 15 days.
Drugs can forestall death for about 45 days. Researchers don't know
what causes the condition, which develops about four to nine weeks
after conception.
   The Whismans have been told that if Page continues improving
they can take her home within three weeks. For now, they make the
hour-long commute daily from their home in Cicero, Ind., about 20
miles from Indianapolis, to visit Page.
   ``It's limited the time we can spend with her. She was really
alert today and her eyes were bright. She knows when her lullabies
were playing,'' Mrs. Whisman said in a telephone interview Sunday
night.
   The twins were artificially conceived in August because the
Whismans had been unable to conceive on their own.
   Page was born one minute before Tyler. He was born brain dead,
asphyxiated in the womb just before birth, doctors said. Page
appeared strong at delivery, but doctors discovered the heart
defect within 12 hours.
   The Whismans had the idea for a transplant.
   ``It was just a passing thing. I had made the comment that
wouldn't it be amazing if it was up to Tyler to save his sister's
life,'' said Mrs. Whisman, 40, who began taking fertility drugs in
July when she had difficulty getting pregnant.
   Because the twins were not identical, the chances of an organ
match weren't certain. But in four of the six compatibility factors
that surgeons test for, the twins matched.
   When Page is old enough, Mrs. Whisman said, she will be told of
her brother's gift of life.
   ``We've got pictures of Tyler. We'll tell her. We think it's
real important that she know that it was her brother that saved her
life,'' she said.
   The Whismans also decided to donate Tyler's liver to a
Pennsylvania newborn. ``Even if the tissues hadn't matched to help
Page, we would have still wanted his life to touch someone else, to
help someone else,'' Mrs. Whisman said.
   She said the couple believes the unique operation represents
even more than the life of their daughter.
   ``Each time it's done they learn more and maybe it'll make
things easier for the next little baby out there who has the same
problem Page has.''

   In displays of concern over the planet's plight,
people of the world spent Earth Day rallying on streets and
mountaintops, collecting garbage on beaches and shunning fossil
fuel-burning beasts for bicycles.
   On Sunday's 20th anniversary of the first Earth Day, an
estimated 200 million people in 136 countries took part in events
dedicated to saving the environment, organizers said.
   Students carried a globe on a stretcher, symbolizing a sick
Earth, in a parade in Hong Kong's twin city of Kowloon. About 1,000
people marched, many dressed as trees or animals and waving green
ribbons and banners.
   In Chamonix, France, ice sculptors Christian Claudel and Francis
Cuny carved a giant thermometer on the Mer de Glace glacier to
protest global warming resulting from air pollution.
   ``If Earth Day does nothing else, it will ... give the clear
message to politicians that millions of people are aware of the
problems facing the earth and what needs to be done about it,''
said Andrew Lees, of the British branch of Friends of the Earth.
   In Istanbul, Turkey, police arrested 11 people for holding an
unauthorized demonstration to celebrate Earth Day, the
semi-official Anatolia news agency reported.
   In Paris, French activists spelled out the words ``Jour de la
Terre'' (Earth Day) with 40,000 empty bottles at the Trocadero
across from the Eiffel Tower to symbolize the need to recycle glass.
   In Tibet, an international climbing team traveled to the Everest
base camp to clean up rubbish left by previous expeditions.
   About 35,000 people gathered on Japan's Yumenoshima, or Dream
Island, an artificial island in Tokyo Bay made from landfill
consisting mostly of garbage from Tokyo. A temporary facility for
recycling tin cans was set up to emphasize the problem of waste
disposal on the island nation.
   In western Japan, volunteers gathered six tons of trash on a
beach and set it ablaze, according to the public TV network NHK.
   In Gdansk, Poland, students bicycled through the Baltic port's
Old Town to protest air pollution, and a similar protest was held
in Rome.
   Environmentalists on bicycles, roller skates and other motorless
vehicles marched through the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius. Moscow
has virtually cut off the Baltic state's energy supplies in a bid
to break its independence drive.
   East Germans gathered near the Berlin Wall to view exhibits and
celebrate their newly won freedom to raise environmental and other
issues. Under the Communist regime ousted in October,
environmentalists had to operate underground.
   Hundreds of people lined the main highway along the Cape
Peninsula in South Africa to protest a government plan to allow
mining on scenic Chapman's Peak. Later, they presented a petition
against the mining signed by 50,000 people to Gert Kotze, minister
of environmental affairs.
   He has been criticized for supporting mining in the nation's
largest wetlands.
   Participants around the world, including Czechoslovakia's
President Vaclav Havel, planted trees. In northeast Italy,
Franciscan priests planted hundreds of trees along the Piave River.
   The United States, through an aid program, sent 93,000 seedling
apple trees to farmers in Afghanistan, where once-lush orchards
have been devastated by the 12-year-old war between U.S.-backed
guerrillas and the Soviet-backed government.
   The Greenpeace environmental group floated a hot-air balloon
above Plaza Colon in downtown Madrid to demand a ban on the
production of chlorofluorocarbons, which scientists say destroy the
Earth's fragile ozone layer.

<HEAD>Williams Admits Visiting Prostitutes as Young Man</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Clayton Williams' spokesman says the
Republican gubernatorial candidate's admission that he patronized
prostitutes as a young man demonstrates his ``greatest strength'' _
honesty.
   Democrat Ann Richards' campaign charged that Williams' remarks
raise new questions about the 58-year-old oilman-rancher's
attitudes toward women.
   The Houston Post reported Sunday that Williams admitted
patronizing prostitutes in Texas and Mexico as a teen-ager and as a
student at Texas A&amp;M University. He said it had been at least 35
years since he had done so.
   ``I've never claimed to be a perfect man,'' Williams told the
newspaper. ``It's part of growing up in West Texas. ... It's like
the Larry McMurtry book, The Last Picture Show.''
   He added: ``It was a lot different in those days. The houses
were the only place you got serviced then.''
   Williams press secretary Bill Kenyon, trying to turn the remark
to the candidate's advantage, said, ``One of Clayton's greatest
strengths as a person is one of his greatest `weaknesses' as a
politician; he always tries to be honest.''
   Kenyon said that Williams had answered a reporter's question by
telling the truth, ``even when it wasn't politically expedient.''
   Williams was in Arizona and not available for comment.
   ``In recent months, the Republican nominee has made several
comments which taken together drive this wedge between men and
women, and I think that's unfortunate,'' said Glenn Smith, Ms.
Richards' campaign manager.
   Smith said the state treasurer, who was vacationing, didn't wish
to comment on Williams' statement.
   Smith said Williams has made a series of remarks about women
that should be a topic of debate. ``He implies that women are here
to `service' men. That kind of an attitude is as insulting to men
as it is to women,'' Smith said.
   A month ago, Williams came under fire for a remark during a
cattle roundup on his ranch. Williams likened bad weather to rape
and said that if it is inevitable, ``just relax and enjoy it.'' He
apologized the next day.
   During a visit to Washington before the Democratic runoff,
Williams told reporters he would feel uncomfortable running against
a woman.
   Prostitution is legal in some areas of Mexico, including most
border cities. Prostitutes must have health cards and undergo
weekly checkups. In Mexico City and some other areas, prostitution
is illegal but tolerated.
   Ms. Richards won the Democratic nomination on April 10 after a
mudslinging campaign in which her opponent, Attorney General Jim
Mattox, accused her of using illegal drugs as recently as 10 years
ago.
   A recovering alcoholic, Ms. Richards declined to give a
yes-or-no answer when asked about drug use.

   Newspaper executives gathered to hear
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico address the annual
meeting of The Associated Press today and to choose directors of
the news cooperative.
   Prior to the luncheon at the Century Plaza Hotel, AP was to hold
its annual meeting at the Shubert Theater. The meeting and luncheon
are attended by publishers and editors representing the news
cooperative's 1,486 newspaper members. They are the opening-day
events at the 104th annual convention of the American Newspaper
Publishers Association.
   Salinas, 42, took office Dec. 1, 1988, for a six-year term.
Since then, he has cracked down on government corruption and drug
traffickers. He also has opened the economy to foreign investment
and imports.
   The AP meeting will include a report to the membership by
William J. Keating, chairman of the AP's board of directors, and
Louis D. Boccardi, president and general manager of the AP. Keating
is chairman and publisher of The Cincinnati Enquirer.
   AP members also will see a video presentation called ``AP '89:
Witness to History'' and hear a panel discussion on Eastern Europe.
   Boccardi will moderate the panel consisting of Walter R. Mears,
AP vice president and Washington columnist; Mort Rosenblum, AP
special correspondent based in Paris; Alison Smale, AP chief of
bureau in Vienna; Juergen Ruhfus, West Germany's ambassador to the
United States; and Arnold Horelick, senior corporate Fellow on
Soviet Affairs at the Rand Corp.
   AP members also will elect six members of the cooperative's
board of directors from 12 nominees.
   Incumbents seeking re-election are: James K. Batten, chairman
and chief executive officer of Knight-Ridder, Inc., based in Miami;
J. Stewart Bryan III, chairman and publisher of the Richmond (Va.)
Times-Dispatch and The Richmond News Leader; Ruth S. Holmberg,
publisher of The Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times; Tom Johnson, chairman
of the Los Angeles Times; and Joe D. Smith Jr., president of the
Alexandria (La.) Daily Town Talk.
   Other nominees include: Walter E. Bartlett of The Greenville
(S.C.) News; Richard L. Conner of the Fort Worth (Texas)
Star-Telegram; Robert H. Hartmann of The Evansville (Ind.) Press;
Beverly Kees of The Fresno (Calif.) Bee; and George W. Wilson of
the Concord (N.H.) Monitor.
   One nominee representing a city of less than 50,000 population
will be chosen to succeed retiring director John O. Emmerich Jr. of
the Greenwood (Miss.) Commonwealth. Emmerich was not eligible for
re-election because he has served the maximum three consecutive
three-year terms on the board.
   Candidates are Ted M. Natt of The Daily News of Longview, Wash.,
and David J. Whichard II of the Greenville (N.C.) Daily Reflector.

   A wall in memory of 35 students killed in
the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 has been unveiled at Syracuse
University.
   ``The students we honor this day will serve as an inspiration
for all students over the years to live full, warm and contributive
lives,'' Syracuse Chancellor Melvin Eggers said during the
unveiling Sunday.
   Students and victims' families were in the crowd of more than
600 at the dedication of the 4-foot-high, semicircular limestone
wall with the students' names engraved in an 18-inch granite band
around the top.
   The wall is on a bricked plaza at the university's main
entrance. The pathway to The Place of Remembrance is lined with
pear trees and heather.
   The students were killed in the Dec. 21, 1988, terrorist bombing
over Lockerbie, Scotland. They were returning home after a semester
aboard under a Syracuse program. Of the 35 students, 25 attended
Syracuse and 10 were from other schools.
   All 259 people aboard the jetliner died. Eleven others were
killed on the ground.
   Robert P. Berrell, whose son Steven died in the bombing, said
the dedication helped switch everyone's focus ``back to the victims
who died, instead of the victims who lived.''

   District Judge David Young is not a man to
be toyed with.
   Young has become so weary of lollygagging attorneys and other
court officials that he's imposed a fine for tardiness, even
penalizing himself three times.
   The minimum mandatory for latecomers? A Transformer or Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtle will do just fine.
   Those fined must bring a toy to court.
   ``The real thing I want people to learn is I expect them to be
on time, to keep their calendars in order and to keep things
moving,'' he said. ``At the same time there are a lot of children
who can benefit from something like this.''
   When the pile of toys behind the judge's bench gets too high,
they are taken to local charities.
   Lawyer Bob Merdith, who was overdue for a hearing, was the
latest to take the cure.
   ``Hey, I got nailed. But I thought, well, I'll be glad to
comply,'' he said. ``I think it's a fantastic idea.''

   Milton Graton says there are quicker ways
to pull a 70,000-pound bridge into place than with two oxen and
wooden rollers. But there isn't a better way.
   Hundreds of residents watched the animals inch the
covered-bridge builder's latest masterpiece onto its foundations
over the weekend.
   ``It's the difference between doing it the right way and the
wrong way,'' the 81-year-old said Saturday. ``It takes longer to do
it the right way.''
   With the yoked oxen strolling in circles to turn a capstan, the
60-foot-long, 14-foot-wide bridge was pulled in place using chains,
500 feet of heavy rope and an old block and tackle.
   Each time the oxen made a circle, the bridge slid forward about
three inches on wooden rollers.
   Though the process was about as lively as watching corn grow,
Marion Merrill of the Ashland Historical Society's Squam River
Covered Bridge Association said, ``It's nice to show people how it
was done years ago.''
   ``It's a great engineering feat,'' she said. ``We today think we
have all the knowledge and they didn't have it years ago.''
   The state had proposed a $1.1 million steel-and-concrete span to
replace a condemned concrete bridge over the Squam River. But in
1988 town selectmen entered into an oral agreement with Graton _
that's the only way he does business _ to build the bridge for
$189,000. The covered-bridge association raised about $200,000 in
donations for the project.
   Graton and Associates, operated by Milton and one of his three
sons, Arnold, 52, began construction last year.
   Arnold Graton said the old-fashioned bridge is just what you'd
expect to find in a town like Ashland.
   ``You don't go play golf on a cement golf course with plastic
grass,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Down in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged lower against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange also fell in
listless trading.
   The dollar closed at 157.55 yen, down 0.05 yen from its 157.60
yen close on Friday. It opened at 157.40 yen and traded between
157.05 yen and 157.58 yen.
   Currency dealings were dominated by cross trading between the
yen and the West German mark that kept the dollar-yen rate fairly
stable, dealers said.
   Kaneo Ogino, senior dealer with Goldman Sachs in Tokyo, said the
yen was likely to remain weak against the mark ahead of a May 6
decision on unifying the East and West German currencies.
   The yen also is being weakened by speculation over possible West
German and U.S. interest rate increases that would enhance the
appeal of the mark and dollar, dealers said.
   The dollar, meanwhile, is expected to remain in a ``box,''
trading between 155 and 160 yen, Ogino said.
   Dealers said it was hard to determine the dollar's direction,
because no incentives were driving the currency.
   At the same time, there is speculation that the U.S. acceptance
of a weak yen is waning because of fears of a deterioration in the
trade imbalance, they said. The weak yen makes Japanese exports
more price competitive overseas.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues fell 156.37 points, or 0.52 percent, closing at 29,679.07.
It lost 109.97 points Friday.
   An estimated 330 million shares changed hands in thin trading.
   Analysts predicted little movement in prices ahead of the
``Golden Week'' holidays. Japan's financial markets will be closed
next Monday, Thursday and Friday for the series of holidays.
   ``People are in a holiday mood,'' said Christopher Leighton,
manager of international sales at Schroder Securities.
   A ``temporary equilibrium'' was believed to exist in all three
major financial markets _ bond, currency, and equities _ and ``no
one wants to disturb it,'' he said.
   The equilibrium level for the Nikkei was believed to be 30,000
points; for the dollar, 160 yen, and for the benchmark Japanese
government bond, a yield of about 7.3 percent, Leighton added.
   The price of benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government bonds
declined to 86.19 points as of 4 p.m. from Friday's close at 86.36.
The yield stood at 7.325 percent, up from 7.29 percent.

   Here are excerpts from a Syrian state
television interview with released American hostage Robert Polhill
on Sunday night:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Q: How do you feel after being released?
   A: I'm very happy and grateful to all the people who spent time
on my case. I'm still deeply concerned about my two friends and
others who are still held in the conditions I was held in.
   Some of them have been held longer than me. My happiness tonight
is a bit toned down that they're not with me. I'm looking forward
that we'll be together again, all of us ...
   I don't know where I'm going. I think it's better you ask me
specific questions. I'm not sure. I can't summarize 39 months of my
life. It's a little bit difficult at this moment. I didn't have
time to begin relecting yet on those 39 months of my life.
   Q: How was your first day in captivity?
   A: I remember my first day in captivity more than the rest of my
days in captivity ... It was boring. We were kept away to ensure
the security of our being kept.
   That prevented us from doing anything. We were not allowed to
speak loudly. We had something to read, but we were deprived
materials that gave any news about us.
   As to our specific conditions, I can tell you it could have been
a lot worse. We were not maltreated, thanks to those who guarded
us, who tried to give us things within the limits of the
restrictions on them. We played cards ...
   We were very much in the dark about our status. We didn't know
where we stood. That was the worst. We didn't know whether we were
going to be released and when or whether we were ever going to be
released.
   In fact, I know that those left behind and others still in
captivity in places I'm not aware of ... quite possibly don't know
that I've been released. But I guess they'll have hope if they know
I've been released.
   Q: What does freedom mean to you?
   A: Freedom is something that, believe it or not, neither me nor
my two associates spent a lot of time thinking about. It's a bit
like you wish you had a T-bone steak in front of you.
   Knowing you were not going to get it right away makes you more
hungry, makes you want that steak more. So we didn't spend time
thinking or talking about when we'd be freed.
   Our most difficult assignment was to find things to think about.
To keep our minds active so we didn't begin to vegetate. I don't
know what psychologists say about this. My belief is that part of
the symptom of a mind beginning to stray and go bad to the point of
danger is the loss of anger.
   I was angry at what was done to me, at being taken away from my
wife and family, my friends and students. And so I strived to
continue to be angry, knowing at all times that if I began to lose
that anger I would just sort of become a vegetable, and I didn't
want that to happen.
   Q: What do you want to say to the world?
   A: One thing I probably should say is that I was a little bit
surprised to find out that the specific demand these men (the
kidnappers) are making and want the world to know seems to be
precisely the same they made about two weeks after our kidnapping,
when Alann Steen made the videotape _ releasing the 400 prisoners
held in Israeli jails. We seem right back at ground zero.
   One of the last words I heard today from one of them as they
went out was that was still their demand. I don't know if it's
still the same 400 prisoners or others.
   Besides that, I don't think I have any other messages that I'm
supposed to be carrying to the people or governments of the world
or the United Nations ... As I say this is rather surprising.
   I'd have thought things would have changed over the three years,
that some of those prisoners got released, I don't know.
   Q: What are your plans for the future?
   A: I really don't have any plans for the future yet, except to
see my wife, mother, sons and friends and family. People I haven't
seen in three years, or 39 months, and together talk about things
like that. About the future.

   Oklahoma teachers realize they will be held
accountable for better schools after a four-day strike that won
them the biggest education funding bill in state history, union
officials say.
   The walkout ended with the Legislature approving the $230
million bill on Thursday. Most teachers were back in class the next
day. Schools that did not reopen Friday were expected to resume
classes today.
   Teachers realize the bill is ``just a first step and is not
going to solve all the problems of education,'' Karla Feeley,
spokeswoman for the 31,000-member Oklahoma Education Association,
said Sunday.
   Teachers celebrating at a union meeting Friday and Saturday
``were euphoric and sharing their happiness and talking about the
need to get down to it and make it happen,'' she said.
   The strike began last Monday to protest legislative inaction on
the bill, which calls for raising $230 million by increasing sales
and income taxes.
   A one-half cent increase in the 4-cent state sales tax would
raise $104 million, as would a 10 percent increase in personal
income taxes. An increase in the corporate tax from 5 percent to 6
percent would produce $22 million.
   The bill calls for spending $68.1 million to raise minimum
teacher salaries by $1,500 a year for four years. It also provides
money for special education and early childhood development
programs.
   Oklahoma teachers say they rank 48th in pay among the states,
making $22,000 a year compared with the national average of $29,648.

   Two days of fighting between Moslem separatists
and Chinese security forces in the country's far west claimed 22
lives, the region's media said in reports that broke two weeks of
official silence on the unrest.
   The local television reports in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region said 15 Moslem protesters, a provincial official and six
policemen were killed and 19 police wounded in the April 5-6
clashes in Akto County.
   In its report Sunday, the station claimed militant separatists
in the region had formed the Islamic Party of East Turkistan and
proclaimed a holy war to establish an independent republic.
   Akto County is 25 miles south of the ancient bazaar city of
Kashgar and less than 60 miles from the Soviet border.
   Foreign travelers in Xinjiang's capital of Urumqi said at the
time of the rioting that troops had been sent in to quell
disturbances in Kashgar and two other cities, Hotan and Kuqa, and
that an estimated 50 people were killed.
   The weekend television reports, monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp. did not mention unrest anywhere except Akto's
Baren Township.
   The foreign sources said the rioting broke out after a dispute
over the building of a mosque, but Xinjiang television called the
clash in Akto a premeditated ``counterrevolutionary armed
rebellion'' and made no mention of the mosque dispute.
   More than half of Xinjiang's 14 million people are from Moslem
minority groups such as Uygurs, Kazakhs, Taziks, and Kirghiz, many
with close cultural ties to the restive Moslem nationalities of
Soviet central Asia.
   Relations between Moslems and Han Chinese in Xinjiang have long
been strained. In May, serious rioting broke out in Urumqi when
Moslems angered by a Chinese-language book on Moslem sexual habits
stormed Communist Party headquarters.
   In recent months, Xinjiang officials have repeatedly made
unspecified warnings about the threat of ``separatists'' using
religion to undermine the unity of the nation.
   Media reports have said the government is tightening controls
over religious activities, including closing unauthorized religious
schools and stripping Moslem imams, or high priests, who violate
laws against proselytizing of their religious qualifications.
   In its Sunday broadcast, the local Xinjiang station said a
``very small number of reactionary elements'' in Baren had declared
the ``holy war'' seeking an independent republic. The group was
reported to have vowed to form Moslem death squads and preached the
triumph of Islam over Marxism, Leninism and socialism.
   ``This gang, under the banner of religion, incited a religious
craze, and wildly proclaimed the launching of a sacred war to
eliminate the heathens,'' the television report said.
   The report quoted an unnamed leader as saying, ``Even Moslem
women must kill the enemy.''
   It said ringleaders included fugitive murderers, former labor
camp inmates and habitual thieves who met together many times. They
recruited dozens of young people whom they trained to be ``hired
thugs'' and amassed weapons and ammunition, including long knives,
dynamite packs and grenades.
   They allegedly forced ``ill-informed masses'' to make trouble on
April 5, and surrounded officials and security forces who tried to
maintain order.
   ``They frenziedly stopped and attacked the public security
personnel who went to perform their duty, robbed them of their
weapons and killed six armed police officers and fighters, injured
13 others and destroyed four police vehicles,'' it said.
   The next day, they opened fire and hurled bombs at police and
officials, wounding three more police officers. Police retaliated,
killing 15 rioters. A provincial official was killed and three
security officials hurt during the pursuit, the report said.
   Following the unrest, Xinjiang closed the area to all foreign
visitors. Officials in both Urumqi and Beijing have refused to
comment on the reported clashes.
   National news media have ignored the strife. The Communist
Party's official newspaper, the People's Daily, on Sunday carried a
lengthy front-page article praising the central government's
support for Xinjiang's economic and cultural development.
   It said the government's policies have strengthened unity among
the region's various minorities.

<HEAD>`Joke' About Pilot's Sobriety Delays Northwest Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman blamed for a four-hour delay of a
Northwest Airlines flight says she was just joking when she
questioned the pilot's sobriety.
   ``I said, when they told us that a pilot was on his way in to
staff the plane, `I hope he hasn't been partying.' I didn't even
say `drunk,''' Ann Beaver said Saturday in a telephone interview
from Atlanta, where she was visiting her children.
   A flight attendant and the pilot, whom Northwest has refused to
identify, took the comment seriously, and the pilot demanded a
blood test, which showed no alcohol in his system, the airline
said. Results of a urine test were expected today.
   The pilot had been assigned to Flight 497 from Detroit to
Atlanta on Thursday after the scheduled pilot was delayed en route
from Milwaukee.
   Beaver said she made her remark as the substitute pilot was
driving to the Detroit airport. She said she told him she was only
joking, but ``he said, `You made an allegation, and now I have to
go to a hospital and take a blood test.'
   The flight was delayed while another substitute pilot was
procured. When the plane finally left, Beaver and her husband
stayed behind because other passengers were mad at them, Northwest
said. The couple took a flight Friday.
   Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said Beaver seriously questioned
the pilot's sobriety and integrity. He said the pilot has an
``impeccable record'' in his more than 20 years with the airline.
   Beaver said she has been made a scapegoat. ``I'm a certified
social worker with a master's degree,'' said Beaver, 50. ``I'm not
a nut.''
   Three Northwest pilots were arrested on March 8 in Minneapolis
and accused of flying from Fargo, N.D., while drunk. They were
fired and face state and federal charges.
   ``By the conduct of three former crew members, we made ourselves
a target for some jokes, and we're able to withstand it,'' Gibbons
said. ``But this was more than a joking remark in the estimation of
the man who was going to fly the plane.''

<HEAD>4,000 Teen-agers March at Auschwitz to Honor Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GABRIELLE GLASER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSWIECIM, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After marching from the Auschwitz death
camp to the crematoria of Birkenau, the roughly 4,000 teen-agers
from 36 countries marking Holocaust Memorial Day lighted torches
and heard a prayer for the dead.
   In Israel, sirens wailed for two minutes Sunday as life briefly
came to a standstill in remembrance of the 6 million Jews slain by
the Nazis.
   Writer Elie Wiesel, diplomats and Israeli parliamentarians
joined the young marchers in southern Poland for the two-mile
``March of the Living.''
   The sunny day turned cloudy and light rain started as Wiesel
stood at a podium before a gray stone monument to recall his time
at Auschwitz:
   ``Years and years ago I saw _ I cannot tell you what I saw. I'm
afraid that if I told you we would all wake up in tears and would
not be able to stop. I see a young girl. ... ,'' he said before
stopping, apparently unable to continue. He silently left the
podium.
   Many cried as the students _ some carrying Israeli flags and
others bouquets of flowers _ walked along the train tracks that
ended at the cremetoria.
   Dandelions waved in the wind-swept grass now covering the rubble
of the camp. Torches were lighted, poems read and mournful violin
songs played before a reading of the Kaddish, a Jewish prayer for
the dead.
   Shawn Tepper, 17, of Miami Beach, Fla., held hands with a row of
other young American Jews. She said the experience was overwhelming
but ``proved to everyone that we are alive, we are together and we
are strong.''
   The march was in memory of those who died in Nazi death camps as
well as in the Warsaw ghetto uprising that began April 19, 1943.
   In the uprising, several hundred Jewish insurgents staged a
desperate three-week struggle against the Nazi drive to liquidate
the last 75,000 residents of the walled ghetto.
   Sunday's event was the second ``March of the Living.''
Participants said it had special significance because of the drive
toward German unification and Israel's rapid renewal of ties with
Eastern European countries that once had flourishing Jewish
communities.
   The Nazis built Auschwitz as the main engine of Hitler's ``Final
Solution.'' Estimates of the death count vary, but recent research
has put the toll at the camp at about 1.5 million, more than 90
percent Jews.
   In Israel, as the sirens sounded at 10 a.m. Sunday, traffic
ground to a halt, and thousands stood silently at attention to
honor the victims.
   Hundreds of Israelis also marked the day by participating in
ceremonies across the country at which the names of victims were
read by relatives and friends.
   According to recent statistics, 302,404 Holocaust survivors live
in the nation of 4.7 million people, including Polish-born Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir and other top military and political
leaders.
   ``I remember my family members who have died in those terrible
and fearsome days,'' said Shamir, 74, during a ceremony outside
parliament. He lost his parents, two sisters, their husbands and
children during World War II.
   The Holocaust still deeply influences private lives and politics
in Israel, reflected in both the right-wing preoccupation with
security and the liberal drive to guard human rights. But its
impact on the younger generation is diminishing.

   Robert Polhill, who used to talk of his love for his wife's
native Lebanon, left that country a weakened man who said he kept
his sanity during 39 months of captivity by staying angry at his
captors.
   ``I was angry at what was done to me, at being taken away from
my wife and family, my friends and students,'' the 55-year-old
American educator said in a Syrian television interview after his
release Sunday.
   ``And so I strived to continue to be angry, knowing at all times
that if I began to lose that anger, I would just sort of become a
vegetable and I didn't want that to happen.''
   Polhill, a professor of business and accounting at Beirut
University College, was kidnapped with two other U.S. educators on
Jan. 24, 1987, by the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine.
   He had lived in Lebanon for four years with his second wife,
Feryal, who is Lebanese.
   His mother, Ruth Polhill, a retired high school librarian who
lives in Fishkill, N.Y., said in an interview before her son's
release that he had visited Lebanon on one of his first business
trips for a New York City accounting firm.
   ``It was very beautiful,'' she recalled. ``He loved the people.
He loved the campus.''
   Despite his anger while held 1,182 days by the pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem militants, Polhill said he tried not to think about
when he would be released.
   ``Freedom is something that, believe it or not, neither me nor
my two associates spent a lot of time thinking about,'' he said in
the Syrian interview. ``It's a bit like you wish you had a T-bone
steak in front of you.
   ``Knowing you were not going to get it right away makes you more
hungry, makes you want that steak more. So we didn't spend time
thinking or talking about when we'd be freed.''
   Polhill said he was not mistreated and that his guards tried to
provide amenities within the limitations placed on them. But the
uncertainties terrified him and his two fellow captives.
   ``We were very much in the dark about our status,'' he said.
``We didn't know where we stood. That was the worst. We didn't know
... when or whether we were ever going to be released.''
   Polhill, a diabetic, attended Cornell University and graduated
from New York University in 1961.
   He later began work as a New York City accountant. He was
described as a photography buff, an avid New York Giants fan and a
committed educator.
   Polhill had two children from a previous marriage.
   His mother said he told her before his abduction that he was not
fearful living on the Beirut campus. ``Now that's what he tells his
mother,'' she said. ``He had all the confidence he's be safe on the
Beirut campus.''
   Said son Brian: ``We knew it (kidnapping) was a possibility, but
it wasn't something he put a big accent on. He was extremely
careful. He kept a low profile.''
   Syrian TV on Sunday showed Polhill being driven through Beirut,
Lebanon, sitting in the back of a car and puffing heavily on a
cigarette. He appeared drawn after his long ordeal and smiled wanly
several times.
   He said his first day of captivity stood out mostly clearly in
his mind.
   ``I remember my first day in captivity more than the rest of my
days in captivity. ... It was boring,'' he said.
   He added, ``We were not allowed to speak loudly. We had
something to read, but we were deprived materials that gave any
news about us.''

   Unseasonably warm weather prevailed in much of the nation today,
though severe thunderstorms threatened to cause more damage in the
South, Southeast and the Plains.
   Temperatures were expected to edge up into the 70s and 80s in
many places today and Tuesday.
   But clouds and showers were expected to keep temperatures down
in the Rockies and the Northwest, while a cold front moving
southward through New England was bringing cooling Northeast winds.
It was only 39 degrees this morning in Portland, Maine.
   On Sunday, thunderstorms in Florida spawned a tornado in
Jacksonville and high winds that downed trees and power lines
around the town of Bunnell.
   Thunderstorms in Mississippi produced golf ball-size hail at
D'Iberville and in Jackson County on Sunday. Thunderstorms in
Oklahoma produced golf ball-size hail at Cheyenne.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were over the southern high
Plains region Sunday night. A thunderstorm in southwest Texas
dropped inch-thick hail in Balmorhea.
   Showers associated with a cold front were over the northern and
central Rocky Mountain region. Showers associated with another cold
front were over the northern and central Pacific Coast region.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation.
   Strong southerly winds prevailed across the central U.S. on
Sunday, with winds above 30 mph in North Dakota and Minnesota.
   But the winds did not drive out heat in the Dakotas, where
several record highs were set.
   The afternoon high of 92 degrees at Huron, S.D., surpassed their
previous record for the date by 7 degrees.
   Chamberlain and Pickston, S.D., recorded the high temperatures
for the Lower 48 states _ 94 degrees.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises, Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against most other major
currencies in calm trading in Europe this morning, but traders said
they didn't expect the currency to rise much further.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Traders said the dollar was up because of higher U.S. interest
rates and uncertainty over the future of the West German mark
during the German unification process.
   ``The dollar still has some possibilities to move higher
(Monday), but the margins remain very limited,'' one Milan trader
said.
   He predicted the dollar would run into strong resistance around
1.6970 West German marks, before resuming its longer-term downward
trend.
   The market was quiet and not much activity was expected until
the opening of the U.S. market, he said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.05 yen to a closing 157.55 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 157.50 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.6943 West German marks, up from 1.6895
   _1.4880 Swiss francs, down from 1.4910
   _5.6878 French francs, up from 5.6695
   _1.9050 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8910
   _1,243.50 Italian lire, up from 1,240.00
   _1.1625 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1619
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, which was
quoted at $1.6363, compared with $1.6357 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $376.50 a troy ounce, up
from $374.75 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $375.65.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $375.85, down from $376.50 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 38 cents to close at a bid of
$376.98.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.09 a troy ounce, from
Friday's $5.08.

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An abortion rights group is jumping into
the Iowa governor's race with an ad campaign that attacks an
anti-abortion Democrat but also aims to persuade one of two
pro-choice candidates to drop out.
   Kate Michelman of the National Abortion Rights Action League
concedes it's a high-risk tactic, but says her group's campaign
dramatizes the importance of gubernatorial races since the Supreme
Court expanded the power of states to regulate abortion.
   ``No election is more important than Iowa's race for governor
this year,'' Ms. Michelman said.
   Ms. Michelman said her group will launch a series of ads
attacking Attorney General Tom Miller, a Democrat, contending
``voters won't have a choice'' if he's nominated to run against
incumbent Republican Gov. Terry Branstad. Both Miller and Branstad
take anti-abortion positions.
   Miller, asked last weekend about the planned ad campaign, called
NARAL a single-issue group and added, ``They represent all that's
wrong with politics in America today.''
   The campaign ran into an immediate complication, as seven of
eight commercial television stations refused to carry the ads. That
left the group with cable television and radio stations, but it
vowed to move ahead.
   Ms. Michelman said the drive could wind up persuading one of the
two pro-choice candidates to drop from the race to avoid splitting
the vote.
   ``Our going in at this moment may also contribute to one of the
pro-choice candidates emerging as the leading candidate,'' she said.
   Democratic contenders House Speaker Don Avenson and retired
banker John Chrystal both favor abortion rights, and Ms. Michelman
said both are ``good people.''
   ``This is tough, it's very hard to say you hope one will get
out,'' she said. ``If it makes sense and we believe strategically
it would ensure that Branstad has a pro-choice challenger, we may
end up endorsing ... the candidate we believe has the best chance
of winning.''
   That announcement probably wouldn't come until a few weeks
before the June 5 primary, she said.
   Avenson has been endorsed by virtually all labor unions in the
state, and by some women's groups. He is generally considered the
leading pro-choice contender. He has held discussions with Ms.
Michelman about a possible endorsement.
   The campaign underscores the focus being placed on Iowa by both
pro-choice and anti-abortion activists. The state is the home of
the first presidential caucuses every four years.
   Abortion also is a major issue in Iowa's U.S. Senate race, in
which incumbent Democrat Tom Harkin favors abortion rights and GOP
challenger Tom Tauke is anti-abortion.
   Following last year's Supreme Court decision, the main abortion
battleground is in the states, Ms. Michelman said.
   ``Governors are now the most important elected officials in the
nation,'' she said.
   The ads provide an escalation in a Democratic primary that's
already heated. Miller, the ads declare, ``wants to let the
government interfere in your most personal decision.''
   ``The fact is that Tom Miller is the only anti-choice candidate
in the Democratic primary and it's very important for Democratic
voters to understand that,'' Ms. Michelman said.
   Picking between two candidates who support abortion rights is
more difficult, she conceded.
   ``This is a very unusual step,'' she said. ``We generally do not
endorse in a contest where there are two pro-choice candidates.''

<HEAD>Chemical Accident Sends Fumes Over Trailer Parks; 1,000 Evacuated
For Hours</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUSKEGON, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An accident at a chemical factory sent a
cloud of hydrochloric acid fumes drifting over two trailer parks,
forcing evacuation of about 1,000 people for four hours,
authorities said today.
   The residents were evacuated about 11:30 p.m. Sunday and were
allowed to return home about 3:30 a.m. today, said Dion LeMieux,
fire chief for Muskegon County's Egelston Township.
   A mechanical malfunction at the Lomac Inc. chemical plant caused
phosphorus oxychloride to come in contact with lime, which produced
a violent chemical reaction and released a cloud of the highly
toxic acid fumes, LeMieux said.
   Two firefighters were treated for exposure to the fumes at Mercy
Hospital in Muskegon and released, he said. He said an unknown
number of residents also sought treatment. Mercy Hospital wasn't
immediately able to provide information on those it treated, a
switchboard operator said.
   The acid cloud forced evacuation of a six-square-mile area of
Egelston and Muskegon townships, LeMieux said. He said he had no
idea how many people were forced to flee. He said many took
temporary shelter at Oak Ridge High School.
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency and state Department
of Natural Resources have joined the investigation of the spill, he
said.
   Most of those forced to flee lived in two mobile home parks,
Arlington Estates and Eaglecraft park, authorities said. Together,
the two parks have about 1,000 residents, said Gordon Christian,
manager of Arlington Estates.
   ``You could see the brown in the air,'' Christian said.
   During the evacuation, he said, residents ``were real calm; they
were orderly. I'm proud of them. Everybody looked out for everybody
else. They do look out for their neighbors.''
   A man answering the telephone at Lomac early today said
``everything's under control here.'' He declined to comment further
except to say the company would make a statement later today.

   Cambodian guerrillas claimed they
overran three key government positions today in a major attack to
retake a strategic northwestern town destroyed in recent months by
seesaw fighting.
   About 2,000 guerrillas began attacking the town of Svay Chek on
Sunday, said Ok Serei Sopheak, spokesman for the Khmer People's
National Liberation Front.
   His group is one of two non-Communist factions in a three-party
alliance fighting the Cambodian government. Western and guerrilla
sources also have reported heavy fighting recently in three other
provinces where the Communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas operate.
   Ok Serei Sopheak claimed his faction's guerrillas overran three
villages north of Svay Chek today: Treas, Tas Moan and Don Pok.
They had also seized five other government positions around Svay
Chek, he said.
   He gave no casualty report.
   The guerrilla spokesman also claimed his group's forces had
carried out a commando raid at the provincial capital, Sisophon,
which is a major strategic crossroads about 30 miles east of the
Thai border town of Aranyaprathet.
   The force of 38 men destroyed a fuel depot there, Ok Serei
Sopheak said.
   ``The purpose of the attack on Sisophon was to demoralize the
(government forces) and show we can strike at the heart of the
enemy defense system,'' he said.
   The guerrillas say if they can retake Svay Chek, they will have
recovered all the territory they lost in a government
counter-offensive that began in February.
   About 15,000 people lived in Svay Chek before it became the
center of heavy fighting. The town was burnt to the ground after
guerrillas attempted to retake it in early March.
   Thousands of civilians have fled the recent fighting, some
across the border to refugee camps in Thailand.
   The guerrillas had made big gains in northwestern Cambodia after
Vietnam's announcement in September it had pulled its troops out of
the country. The Vietnamese have been backing the Cambodian
government.
   However, the guerrillas claim thousands of Vietnamese troops
have returned since then. Vietnam denies that.

<HEAD>Friends Of British Hostages Welcome American's Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Friends and family of British hostages in Lebanon
today welcomed the release of American Robert Polhill as a step
toward freeing all the captives, and urged the government to talk
to those who influence the kidnappers.
   ``We seem to be in a period now where people are being released
rather than taken, and of course that is grounds, I would say, for
great optimism,'' said David Waite.
   His brother, Terry Waite, the archbishop of Canterbury's envoy,
disappeared in Beirut in January 1987 while trying to negotiate the
release of American hostages.
   A spokesman for Anglican Archbishop Robert Runcie welcomed
Polhill's release and said: ``If it is a step towards closing the
hostage file, that is even better news.''
   The Friends of John McCarthy, a British journalist kidnapped in
April 1986, warned that if Britain does not begin discussions with
Iran and Syria, it might be the only country unable to bring its
hostages home.
   The group said in a statement: ``The American government will
have achieved this hostage release through diplomacy and
negotiations with the Iranian and Syrian governments, a process the
Friends of John McCarthy have been appealing to the British
government to undertake on behalf of the British hostages for some
years now.''
   The U.S. government says it made no deals with Polhill's
kidnappers. After Polhill was released Sunday, however, President
Bush thanked Syria and Iran for their roles in influencing the
kidnappers.
   Britain broke diplomatic ties with Syria in 1986, accusing it of
complicity in the attempted bombing of an El Al jetliner at
London's Heathrow Airport. Relations with Iran were severed in
February 1989 following the publication of ``The Satanic Verses,''
the novel by Salman Rushdie that has angered many Moslems.
   Conservative lawmaker Robert Adley, chairman of the
British-Syrian Parliamentary Group, called on his party's
government to restore diplomatic relations with Syria immediately.
   The Foreign Office said it has been in close contact with
American officials in recent weeks.
   ``They have assured us they are pressing for the release of all
Western hostages,'' said a spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity in keeping with British custom.
   Britain also seeks the release of retired pilot Jack Mann and
schoolteacher Brian Keenan, who also holds Irish citizenship.
   The Foreign Office says it seeks word on Alec Collett, a New
York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim
they killed him. But his body was never found.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany gave in to a key East
German demand today and said it would convert East German wages to
an equal number of West German marks.
   The East German mark is officially valued at 3-1 against the
West mark but unofficially worth almost nothing outside East
Germany.
   Both nations have said they expect a full merger of the
economies of the nations to be in place on July 1.
   East German salaries will be valued at a straight 1-1 rate to
the powerful West mark, said Dieter Vogel, spokesman for West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Vogel's announcement cleared a major hurdle to an agreement
between the Germanys on eventual unification.
   The East German government of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere
wanted a straight 1-1 exchange for wages, pensions and bank
accounts to offset the effects of eliminating the heavy subsidies
of the former socialist system.
   West Germany's central bank had proposing a 2-1 swap, saying a
1-1 exchange would dilute the value of the West German mark and
possibly cause high inflation and rising interest rates.
   Kohl is nearing completion on a West German proposal for
unification. He met with his Cabinet on Sunday, and the country's
three major political parties held separate discussions today on
the terms of unification.
   The proposal being put together by the Kohl government would
outline West Germany's terms for economic and social unification.
It is in effect an answer to a similiarly broad series of proposals
put together two weeks ago by de Maiziere's coalition government.
   De Maiziere's government wants some employment and housing
guarantees for East Germans who now rely on government housing and
jobs.
   Kohl and his main opposition, the Social Democrats, are trying
offer a compromise that will satisify the East Germans without
alienating West Germans, who vote in nationwide elections on Dec. 2.

<HEAD>Australian Town Plans Evacuation Due to Flooding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRISBANE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The entire population of a small
outback town in eastern Australia _ about 1,600 people _ prepared
today for an immediate evacuation because of rising floodwaters,
authorities said.
   The Warrego River was expected to inundate Cunnamulla, a town
about 500 miles west of Brisbane, sometime Tuesday.
   The river is rising after more than two weeks of heavy rain that
have caused the worst flooding in western Queensland state in more
than a century.
   Four people have been confirmed dead, and five are missing.
About 30,000 were still isolated today as farmers in Queensland,
New South Wales and Victoria reeled from the loss of an estimated
100,000 sheep and cattle.
   Authorities said in a statement that helicopters today ferried
about 90 residents of Cunnamulla to the town's airport. The early
evacuees included pregnant women, mothers with young children and
some elderly people. They were expected to be airlifted to Brisbane.
   ``Evacuation preparations are well under way in Cunnamulla,'' a
police spokeswoman said. ``They're preparing for the worst.''
   Queensland Premier Wayne Goss said he feared some of the small
rural communities may never recover from the floods.
   ``I have seen the clear look of heartbreak and absolute shock in
the eyes of the people who can't believe what has happened to
them,'' Goss told a news conference. ``They have no houses, no
possessions, and many have no futures unless the community is
prepared to help them get back on their feet.''
   Goss today announced a relief package, including police to guard
against looting. He launched a public appeal for contributions.
   Water levels at Charleville, 65 miles upstream from Cunnamulla,
began falling today and some of the 3,000 residents evacuated from
the homes began mopping-up operations.
   The receding floodwaters left houses uprooted from their
foundations. A search still was under way for a family of five
reported missing after leaving their isolated homestead by boat.

   An influential congressman says the United
States should make a goodwill gesture in response to the release of
an American hostage, but an administration official said today
President Bush is ``not into gestures.''
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on the Middle East, said the release of hostage Robert
Polhill on Sunday made it ``appropriate for the United States to
send some kind of a gesture that we're willing to enter into a
dialogue with Iran.''
   John Kelly, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern and
South Asian affairs, said today, ``The policy is very clear. We
don't make deals. The president has said, as he did on inauguration
day, that good will begets good will, but as he noted yesterday, he
wants all the hostages out.''
   Interviewed on NBC's ``Today'' show, Kelly noted that President
Bush has said ``he's not into gestures.'' Nevertheless, Kelly
added, ``we're always looking at how we can improve the situation
and attempting to figure out ways that will speed the release
without compromising our principles.''
   Hamilton and others spoke after Polhill was freed in Lebanon
after spending almost 39 months as a hostage. Their comments came
before Bush reacted publicly to the release by reaffirming his
absolute policy against trading for hostages, but expressing
willingness to give credit where credit is due for Polhill's
release.
   ``It's establishing a dialogue that is critical,'' Hamilton said.
   ``There are a lot of things that could be done here _ short of
aid, short of normalization, short of credits _ that might be a
gesture in response to the release of a hostage,'' he said on
CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.''
   In an initial written statement, Bush thanked Iran and Syria for
their roles in Polhill's release, but subsequently told reporters
he wasn't sure how much Iran had to do with it and said he was
purposely ``stopping a little short'' in his expressions toward
Iran.
   ``I don't want to give credit when I don't know the facts,'' he
said.
   While insisting that he had no intention of trading for hostages
or dealing with kidnappers, and declaring that he was not ``trying
to think up any gesture'' toward Iran or anyone else, Bush did say:
``I'd have goodwill to those who facilitated the release. If that
included Iran, absolutely.''
   But he emphasized that he does not ``have forgiveness in my
heart as long as one American is held against his will.''
   In an editorial in today's editions, the Tehran Times newspaper
said another hostage should be freed to test ``President Bush's
claim that `goodwill begets goodwill.'''
   ``This they should do swiftly in order to leave the ball in the
other party's court to demonstrate its goodwill, if it has any,''
said the English-language newspaper, which often reflects the views
of Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   Iran's foreign minister, meanwhile, was quoted as saying the
pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon wanted a quick reciprocal move.
The official Syrian Arab News Agency, quoting Ali Akbar Velayati in
New York, specified that move would be the release of Sheik Abdul
Karim Obeid, a Lebanese Shiite clergyman abducted by Israeli
soldiers in July.
   Kamal Kharazzi, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, said
today on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that Iran will continue
``trying our best'' to facilitate the release of hostages. ``We are
actually involved in encouraging Lebanese militant Moslems to free
hostages,'' he said.
   Asked if there would be another release soon, he said, ``We hope
so.''
   But he said Bush's policy of no reciprocity unless all the
hostages are released ``would put some more complexity to the
situation. ...these sort of statements may present problems.''
   Richard Murphy, a former assistant secretary of state for the
Near East in the Reagan administration, said today on NBC that ``I
don't think they (the Iranians) have any reason to expect a
positive gesture hostage-by-hostage and that's what the president
in effect is telling us in his statements. He wants them all out.''
   The seven Americans and other Western hostages are believed to
be held by different groups of Shiite Moslems in Lebanon under
differing degrees of influence from Iran.
   Gary Sick, a Columbia University professor who dealt with
Iranian matters during the Carter administration, said Western
nations probably must make concessions to get their hostages out of
Lebanon.
   ``This is not going to be easy,'' he said. ``If the West wants
to get their hostages out, they're going to have to provide some
concessions to Iran and others along the way,'' he said on ``Meet
the Press.''
   ``Our policy for a long time has been that we will talk directly
with the government of Iran, but there can be no normalization of
our relations with the Iranian government until they reject the
notion of terrorism and until they do everything they can to obtain
the release of our hostages,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker
III said at a news conference.
   ``Our policy is that we do not negotiate with hostage-holders
and we don't make deals for hostages,'' Baker said. ``And the
reason we don't is because we think that will simply lead to more
and more hostage-taking.''
   Since the end of the devastating Iran-Iraq war last year,
Rafsanjani has made overtures toward Western nations in an attempt
to rebuild his country's shattered economy.

<HEAD>Christian Holy Sites To Close In Protest Over Jewish Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A day after the government admitted financing a
Jewish settlement in the Old City's Christian quarter, church
leaders said they will close the major Christian sites for a day
and ring bells in protest.
   The protest Friday will mark the first time all Christian holy
places in Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth will close, Samir
Kafiti, Anglican bishop in Jerusalem, said today.
   On Sunday, the Israeli government acknowledged it had put up
$1.8 million for the settlement of 150 Jews in a complex not far
from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The colony, which was set up
on April 11, has provoked angry demonstrations by Christian clerics
and Palestinians, both Christian and Moslem.
   It also has brought legal moves by the Greek Orthodox Church,
which owns the building and wants the Jews evicted.
   The government's acknowledgment Sunday was the first
confirmation of official involvement in buying Arab property in
Jerusalem's walled Old City, captured by Israel during the 1967
Middle East war.
   The settlement, called Neot David, is the only Jewish presence
in the Old City's Christian sector. Its spokesmen have consistently
said no government money was involved in the settlement.
   The Christian leaders, who met early today to consolidate their
response to the settlement, said Israeli government involvement in
the matter ``endangers the survival of all Christian communities in
the Holy City.''
   Among the church properties to be closed are the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre, the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem and the
Church of the Annunciation in Nazareth.
   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, said the churches' planned protest was too hasty, since the
issue of the Jewish settlement is before Israeli courts.
   ``I think with the reputation of Israeli justice it would be
worthwhile for those organizations to wait until there is a court
decision,'' Pazner said. ``I hope they will reconsider this
decision.''
   The government money for the settlement passed from the Housing
Ministry to a subsidiary trusteeship of the Jewish National Fund,
the ministry said in a statement. The fund, part of a
quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, was created in 1901 to buy land
for the founding of Israel.
   The funds then went to a Panamanian company, SBC, which invested
an additional sum to buy legal rights to the four buildings. It
then rented the space to a religious Jewish group, which created
the settlement.
   ``This government-backed settlers' action continues to provoke
almost daily violent incidents in and around the area containing
the Holy Sepulcher and the centers of church governance,'' read a
statement signed by ten Christian church leaders.
   Signatories included the Greek Orthodox Patriarch Diodorus I,
the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Michel Sabbah, and leaders of
other churches.
   They said ``freedom of access to the Holy Sepulcher and freedom
of worship within it have been threatened'' and the settlement
``seriously jeopardizes the integrity, cultural, and religious
autonomy of the Christian, Armenian and Moslem quarters in
violation of the centuries-old status.''
   The Christian leaders demanded immediate eviction of the
settlers, and return of the property to the Greek Orthodox Church.
The church claims that a former tenant sold his rights illegally.
   Israel's Supreme Court is expected to continue its hearing of
the eviction dispute Thursday. The court stayed an eviction order
during the proceedings.
   A separate case on the property dispute is before a lower court,
and attorneys for the church say a ruling in not expected before
six months.
   The church closure will be in effect between 9 a.m. Friday and
an unspecified hour the following day, and church bells will play a
funeral toll on the hour from 9 a.m. until noon Friday.
   However, both Diodorus I and Kafiti, who addressed reporters to
announce the protest measures, say the closure may remain in effect
longer than announced.

   An estimated 200 million people all over the planet celebrated
the 20th anniversary of Earth Day as activists pleaded for the rise
of a new ``conservation generation'' to care for the fragile
environment.
   Even as a hot air balloon representing the Earth rose in Times
Square and tens of thousands demonstrated at the U.S. Capitol on
Sunday, some worried about sustaining interest in the environment
so that it becomes more than a fad.
   ``Earth Day is primarily a light we turn on so that we can see
the work. The work is still yet to be done,'' said novelist Wallace
Stegner, who led a pledge of allegiance to the Earth in Palo Alto,
Calif., where Earth Day has its headquarters.
   Some of Sunday's activism spilled over into today, when about
400 protesters blocked traffic and overturned garbage bins along
New York's Wall Street during the morning rush hour. More than 100
people were arrested.
   A coalition of groups calling itself Earth Day Wall Street
Action said it hoped to shut down Wall Street for a day to call
attention to ``corporate abuse'' of the environment. But officials
said trading began as usual this morning.
   In Washington on Sunday, Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson urged
more than 100,000 people massed at the foot of the Capitol to work
to motivate politicians and corporate leaders to environmental
action.
   ``I don't want to come back here 20 years from now and have to
tell your sons and daughters that you didn't do your duty,'' said
Nelson, 74, who originated Earth Day when he was a senator from
Wisconsin. ``We've got to raise a conservation generation.''
   Earth Day was celebrated in more than 3,600 U.S. communities and
in 140 other nations, according to organizers.
   Environmentalists collected tons of garbage from Japanese
beaches, sculpted a giant thermometer from a French glacier to
protest global warming and carried a globe on a stretcher,
symbolizing a sick Earth, in a parade in Hong Kong's twin city of
Kowloon.
   In New York, an estimated 1 million people turned to the
greenest part of Manhattan, Central Park, for a concert that
included performances by Hall and Oates, the B-52's, the Roches and
the Saturday Night Live Band. Concerts also drew hundreds of
thousands to Earth Day activities in Boston and San Francisco.
   ``Within 50 years, if we don't change the way we do things, we
won't recognize this Earth,'' consumer activist Ralph Nader told a
crowd of about 1,000 at North Carolina State University in Raleigh.
   In New Orleans, nearly 1,000 ``mourners'' watched as a band
played dirges in a jazz funeral for polluted Lake Pontchartrain,
where environmentalists have found evidence of ``dead zones'' _
areas that no longer support aquatic life.
   In the nation's capital, environmental activists blasted
President Bush for bypassing the rally for a vacation in Florida.
``Where is the president today? He's gone fishing!'' railed Ruth
Caplan, executive director of the Environmental Action Foundation.
   Bush took a break from his fishing trip in the Florida Keys to
give what he calls a ``point of light'' award to the citizens group
Reef Relief, which is working to save the coral reef flanking the
Keys.
   In Missouri, thousands of volunteers got down on hands and knees
Sunday to plant 10,000 trees along the Mississippi River.
   ``The thing that was so incredible was that it was obvious
people wanted to do this kind of thing. This is environmental
awareness in action,'' said Skip Kincaid, urban forester for the
Missouri Department of Conservation.
   Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. Casey led an ``All Species Parade''
in Philadelphia, playing the pied piper to children in animal
costumes made from recycled materials.
   Youngsters dressed up as trees or animals in Carbondale, Ill.
``Earth Day will not save the Earth _ it will take several
generations of hard work to save the Earth. So that starts with
children,'' said event organizer Gary Wolf.
   In three U.S. communities, Earth Day was commemorated most
ironically:
   _ In Redwater, Texas, up to 2,000 people were out of their homes
for several hours after hydrogen sulfide gas spewed from an oil
well.
   _ In Muskegon, Mich., about 1,000 people in two trailer parks
were evacuated late Sunday when an accident at a chemical plant
sent a cloud of fumes over their homes. They were allowed to return
home early today.
   _ In Craigsville, Pa., at least 200 people were evacuated Sunday
and others were on standby today after 29 cars derailed on a train
carrying a caustic chemical and crude oil. The resulting explosion
sent flames hundreds of feet in the air and 100,000 gallons of oil
leaked into an Allegheny River tributary.
   Earth Day did not pass without criticism. Sunday's activities
represent the ``fad stage of issue-awareness cycles,'' said Steven
Lamy, an associate professor of international relations at the
University of Southern California.
   After the euphoria ``comes the awareness of how much a real
commitment will cost in time, convenience and money,'' Lamy said.
``That's the stage of the ... cycle when the public tends to lose
interest, and when concern of the issue reverts back to experts.''

   Officials today welcomed the release of a U.S.
hostage by pro-Iranian Shiite kidnappers but gave no indication
Israel is ready to free Arab prisoners to encourage further
releases.
   Robert Polhill, 55, a business professor, was freed Sunday after
1,182 days of captivity.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati called immediately
for a swift reciprocal move _ the freeing of Shiite Moslem cleric
Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, who was abducted by Israeli troops in
Lebanon last July.
   Avi Pazner, spokesman for caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, gave no indication that Israel planned to free Obeid or
urge the freeing of about 300 Shiites and Palestinians held in the
Khiam prison by the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia.
   ``We are very pleased to hear about the release of this
(American) hostage and would like to see the day when all hostages,
Americans, others and especially Israelis are also released. We
pray that that day will come soon,'' Pazner said in an interview.
   He acknowledged that ``on the (hostage) issue as a whole, of
course, we are talking with the United States, as we do on every
issue.''
   But Pazner stressed ``there was no coordination on the release
of this hostage'' between Israel and the U.S. government or any
other party.
   Israel has offered to trade Obeid for all foreign hostages,
along with an Israeli an air force navigator and two soldiers who
were captured by Shiite guerrillas in Lebanon in 1986.
   The South Lebanon Army said it had no intention of freeing
Shiite prisoners in response to Polhill's release, according to
Israel radio.
   However, it could still make such a gesture Thursday or Friday
in connection with the Id Al Fitr, the Moslem holiday marking the
end of the month-long Ramadan fast. Prisoner releases are
traditional during the holiday.
   An Israeli army spokesman declined to say if Israel would
release any of the nearly 9,000 Palestinians jailed in connection
with the 28-month Palestinian uprising.
   The Tehran Times, which is close to Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, called in an editorial for goodwill gestures to
expedite further releases.
   But it said that as long as Israel holds scores of Arab
prisoners, the hostage holders ``will certainly find it hard to
comply with this request and their position is quite
understandable.''
   In the days before Polhill's release, Israel carried out two
attacks in Lebanon that were seen by some observers as increased
pressure on pro-Iranian groups holding hostages.
   On Friday, Israeli troops struck beyond Israel's self-proclaimed
security zone in south Lebanon, killing six guerrillas of the
Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militia that is believed
linked with groups holding Western hostages.
   The day before, Israeli airplanes bombed two bases in Lebanon
belonging to Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, which has ties with Iranian radicals.

   Discovery's astronauts are back for
a second try at a spaceshot, and they're optimistic the shuttle
will lift off with the Hubble Space Telescope on Tuesday despite
one crewman's bad luck with launches.
   Meanwhile, Columbia was rolled out Sunday to the launch pad, 1.6
miles from Discovery, only the second time both pads at Kennedy
Space Center have been occupied. The first time was just before the
Challenger explosion in 1986.
   Discovery is due to lift off at 8:31 a.m. Tuesday. Forecasters
today said they expect an 80 percent chance of favorable weather,
up from the 70 percent predicted Sunday. NASA expects to launch
Columbia no earlier than May 16, one week late because of
Discovery's two-week delay.
   ``Today I bring you only good news,'' NASA test director Al
Sofge said today. ``The launch vehicle is in good shape. The Hubble
Space Telescope is in good shape. The flight crew is ready ... and
the weather looks good. So at this point, everything is go.''
   Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver and his four crew members
returned to Cape Canaveral on Sunday. Shriver poked fun at Steven
A. Hawley's unwanted distinction of having the most shuttle launch
``scrubs,'' or postponements.
   Hawley experienced three postponements on his first flight, in
1984, and six on his second in 1986, a mission he shared with
Discovery's pilot, Charles F. Bolden Jr. He felt so jinxed he
donned a Groucho Marx mask to disguise himself while waiting aboard
Columbia on its seventh _ and successful _ launch attempt.
   Discovery's first launch attempt, halted four minutes before
liftoff April 10 because of a faulty power unit, was Hawley's 10th
mission scrub.
   ``We feel very confident despite the fact that we did not make
Steve wear any kind of disguise or do any kind of masquerade yet,
he and Charlie both,'' Shriver joked.
   NASA test director Mike Leinbach said the countdown, which began
Saturday, was proceeding smoothly and the shuttle appeared to be in
perfect condition. The malfunctioning power unit was replaced a
week ago.
   The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's most expensive and complex
payload, will enable astronomers to look back to nearly the
beginning of time and solve some of the universe's mysteries.
   Discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a
shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper
orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere. Hawley will use the
shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into
space on the second day of the five-day mission.
   A $100 million observatory called Astro will accompany
Columbia's seven astronauts into space next month and probe
ultraviolet radiation.
   Columbia commander Vance Brand said he does not believe NASA is
rushing to get his shuttle up.
   ``In some cases it could be a problem'' having shuttles on both
launch pads, he said. ``In this particular case, everything's
fitting together.''

   Shots were fired at two buses owned by
strike-plagued Greyhound in separate attacks in central
Pennsylvania during the weekend, but no injuries were reported,
authorities said.
   Shots have damaged 36 buses and three terminals since
Greyhound's 6,300 drivers and 3,000 maintenence and office workers
walked out March 2 over wages and job security at America's only
nationwide bus system, Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said.
   Four people have been arrested.
   A bus bound for Philadelphia on U.S. 322 east of Lewistown,
northwest of Harrisburg, was hit by a bullet on the driver's side
above a baggage door Saturday evening, Gravley said.
   The second shooting occurred early Sunday on Interstate 81 at
Harrisburg, he said. A bullet struck the right side of a bus en
route from Pittsburgh to New York, he said.
   State police Trooper Charles McBreen confirmed the shootings and
said the FBI was investigating.
   During the strike, Greyhound has continued to operate with 515
union drivers who crossed picket lines and 2,300 new drivers,
Gravley said.
   The Amalgamated Transit Union has denied any involvement in the
shootings.
   Talks between the union and company have ceased and Gravley has
said the company will not resume talks until at least a week passes
without violence.
   Greyhound is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading
to the conviction of anyone for shooting a Greyhound bus or
terminal.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Reinstate California Murder Conviction of Black
Panther</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate
the California murder conviction a Black Panther Party member who
was shackled during his 17-month trial.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
shackling at Johnny Spain's trial violated his rights.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Spain is entitled to
a new trial or to go free because he was forced to wear 25 pounds
of chain more than 10 hours a day while on trial for allegedly
murdering two San Quentin prison guards.
   In a 2-1 ruling last August, the appeals court said the shackles
prejudiced the jury against Spain by making him appear guilty. The
appeals court said the shackles caused him so much physical and
emotional pain it was difficult for him to assist in his own
defense.
   If extraordinary steps were needed for courtroom security, it
would have been preferable to bar Spain from the trial or permit
him to miss some days to rest and regain his strength, the appeals
court said.
   Spain had said that to avoid chaining he was willing to give up
his right to be present at the trial.
   California prosecutors urged the justices to reinstate Spain's
conviction and life prison sentence.
   Spain, 41, was convicted in 1976 of murdering two guards in a
widely publicized case.
   He was freed on $350,000 bail in March 1988 while the state
appealed to the 9th Circuit court to reverse a federal judge's
ruling that overturned Spain's conviction.
   Since his release, Spain has worked as an electrician and taught
a course entitled, ``Society Behind Bars'' at the University of
California at Berkeley.
   Spain has spent 21 years in prison, beginning in 1967, for a
murder committed in 1966, when he was 17.
   In the case acted on today, Spain was among six inmates dubbed
the ``San Quentin Six'' after they were charged with taking part in
a bloody escape attempt Aug. 21, 1971. Three guards and three
inmates were killed in the incident.
   One inmate who died was George Jackson, a black revolutionary
writer and author of the book ``Soledad Brother.''
   He was shot down attempting to flee San Quentin after taking
over the solitary confinement unit with a gun he produced following
a visit with one of his attorneys. The lawyer, Stephen M. Bingham,
was later acquitted of murder and conspiracy.
   During their trial in a San Rafael, Calif., courtroom, all six
defendants were chained around the legs, wrists and waist, and
other extraorindary security measures were taken.
   The measures were prompted in part by the killing of a judge at
the same courthouse in 1970 when George Jackson's brother,
Jonathan, took over a courtroom and attempted to exchange the
judge, a prosecutor and a juror for his brother and other inmates.
   The case is Rushen vs. Spain, 89-1336.

Standards</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected a chemical
company's challenge to federal standards for clean water.
   The court, without comment, left intact rules that govern more
than 1,000 factories producing organic chemicals, plastics and
synthetic fibers.
   The Environmental Protection Agency adopted the guidelines in
1987 to limit pollutants dumped into the nation's waterways.
   The limits were challenged by PPG Industries Inc. of Pittsburgh,
which said the guidelines are too stringent and that some
violations are unavoidable.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the company's
arguments last year.
   PPG said the appeals court ``unjustifiably concluded that as
long as a hypothetical `best' plant ... theoretically could achieve
the full set of limitations, then it is irrelevant that no actual
plant can do so.''
   The Bush administration urged the justices to reject PPG's
appeal, saying the claims are unsupported by technical evidence.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group
that has said the EPA regulations should be tougher, denounced
PPG's appeal.
   ``PPG has had more than its fair day in court, and this
persistent frontal assault on EPA's rules should be stopped in its
tracks,'' the environmental group's lawyers said.
   The case is PPG Industries vs. Environmental Protection Agency,
89-1079.

   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
a former member of the Church of Scientology of California who
wanted the church declared a phony religion.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Larry
Wollersheim of Aspen, Colo.
   Still pending before the justices is an appeal by the Church of
Scientology of California aimed at overturning a $2.5 million
``emotional distress'' award won by Wollersheim.
   A California appeals court ruled that the church must pay
Wollersheim $500,000 in compensatory damages and $2 million in
punitive damages.
   A trial jury had awarded Wollersheim $30 million in damages but
that amount was reduced by the appeals court.
   Scientology was founded by L. Ron Hubbard, who died in 1986.
   Scientologists believe they can progress toward spiritual
awareness through private sessions in which members' skin responses
to questions are monitored by an electronic device called an
E-meter, which Hubbard invented.
   The church calls such monitoring sessions ``auditing.''
   Wollersheim, a Scientologist from 1969 to 1979, said church
members harassed him and tried to drive his novelty business into
bankruptcy. Scientology officials denied the charges, but a jury in
Los Angeles ruled for Wollersheim.
   Upholding the jury's finding that church officials inflicted
emotional distress on Wollersheim, the state appeals court last
August said, ``There was substantial evidence to support a factual
finding that the auditing, as well as other practices in this case,
were conducted in a coercive environment.''
   The state court therefore ruled that the church's asserted
religious freedom could not shield it from having to pay the
damages award.
   Lawyers for the church are arguing in its appeal that the
Constitution ``prohibits courts from imposing emotional distress
tort liability based upon peaceful religious practices by
permitting juries to determine that such practices constitute
coercive persuasion.''
   The still-pending appeal also raises a due-process challenge to
the $2 million punitive damages award, an issue the justices
already have under study in another case.
   In Wollersheim's appeal rejected today, he accused Scientology
of being ``a mockery of religion'' and a ``religious front.'' But
the appeal did not appear to ask the court for any remedy except a
formal declaration that Scientology is not really religion.
   In response, lawyers for the church told the justices
Wollersheim's appeal sought ``an advisory opinion (that) could have
no possible effect on the outcome of this case in its present
posture.''
   The case is Wollersheim vs. Church of Scientology of California,
89-1367.

<TEXT>
   Military ruler Gen. Ibrahim Babangida
appeared firmly in control of this West African nation today after
narrowly escaping death in a coup attempt.
   President Babangida said his troops had crushed a coup attempt
Sunday after fierce fighting with rebel soldiers, who said they
aimed to end domination of the government by Moslem northerners.
   Traffic jammed the roads of the sprawling coastal capital today,
and the only extraordinary security in sight was around Bonny Camp
on Victoria Island, where rebels captured in the failed coup
attempt were believed held.
   Senior commanders and other members of Babangida's Armed Forces
Ruling Council pledged their support to the president Sunday
evening.
   The mutineers, led by middle-ranking officers, attacked before
dawn Sunday in the West African nation's capital and engaged
loyalist forces for about 11 hours in gun and mortar battles.
   They captured state-run Radio Nigeria offices and announced that
the government had been overthrown. But Babangida's forces later
retook the station after what state media described as ``heavy
bombardment and sporadic shooting.''
   There was no word on how many people were killed in the
fighting, but reporters said casualties appeared heavy.
   The fighting began at 2 a.m. Sunday with an attack on Dodan
Barracks, the military headquarters where Babangida has his
residence.
   The president escaped moments before his residence was shelled,
according to government sources.
   Babangida then fled to Bonny Camp to direct a counterattack by
loyal forces. The coup attempt failed as senior commanders in other
regions of the country went on the radio to declare their support
for Babangida.
   Witnesses also reported heavy fighting around State House.
Gunfire was reported at several other military installations in the
city of 6 million on the Atlantic Ocean.
   Babangida said his aide, Lt. Col. U. K. Bello, was killed in the
gunbattle at the military headquarters, the official News Agency of
Nigeria reported.
   ``The unfortunate situation in Lagos this morning has been
brought under control,'' Babangida told reporters Sunday night.
There were no reports of fighting elsewhere in Nigeria.
   Babangida said many rebel soldiers had been arrested and would
soon face trial, but he did not give any specific figure. Among
those arrested, he said, were ``majors, lieutenants and second
lieutenants'' in the military.
   The rebellion apparently was led by officers opposed to
traditional domination by Moslem northerners over the central and
southern states, which are mainly Christian and animist.
   When the rebels took over the radio station, they broadcast an
announcement accusing the states of Borno, Bauchi, Kano, Katsina
and Sokoto in the Moslem-dominated north of ``messing up'' the rest
of the country.
   A rebel officer said those states would not be allowed to be
part of Nigeria until they fulfilled conditions proving loyalty to
a new government.
   A similar conflict along religious and tribal lines caused the
1967-1969 Biafran War. More than 500,000 civilians and 100,000
soldiers died when easterners attempted to form the state of Biafra
and secede from Nigeria.
   Moslems are a slight majority in the oil-rich nation of 100
million people, Africa's most populous. The country gained
independence from Britain in 1960.
   The rebellious soldiers on Sunday tried to stir up popular
support with radio broadcasts. They told Nigerians, ``This is the
opportunity to free yourselves from internal slavery.''
   The official news agency said other parts of the country were
calm. However, in Ibadan, a southern university city, thousands of
students took to the streets in support of the coup plotters.
   Eleven hours after the fighting began, Lt. Gen. Sani Abacha,
army chief and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, went on
national radio to say the coup had been smashed. He also urged
remaining rebels to surrender.
   The News Agency of Nigeria quoted Col. Ishaya Bamaiyi as saying
earlier announcements by rebel troops who seized the Lagos radio
station represented ``the view of a few disgruntled officers.''
   Babangida's military government has been viewed as weighted in
favor of the Moslem north since the dismissal in December of Lt.
Gen. Domkat Bali, a Christian, as defense minister.
   In one rebel radio broadcast, a man identifying himself as Maj.
Gideon Ngwozor Oka announced:
   ``Fellow Nigerian citizens, on behalf of the patriotic and
well-meaning peoples of the Middle Belt and southern parts of this
country, I ... wish to happily inform you of the successful ousting
of the dictatorial, corrupt, drug-baronish, inhumane, sadistic,
deceitful, homosexually centered and unpatriotic administration of
General Ibrahim Babangida.''
   Babangida took power Aug. 27, 1987, when he overthrew Gen.
Muhammadu Buhari in a bloodless barracks' coup. Nigeria has been
led by military governments for much of its history.
   The general has promised elections and a return to civilian
government in 1992.

<HEAD>Court Agrees to Consider Reinstating Hawaii Assault Conviction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
reinstating a Hawaii woman's assault conviction, thrown out because
a federal magistrate, not a federal judge, presided over jury
selection in her trial.
   The justices said they will review a ruling that overturned
Darlina France's conviction and five-year prison sentence for
shooting her husband.
   Mrs. France was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon,
assault with intent to murder and related charges. She was
sentenced to five years in prison plus three years probation.
   The case was tried in federal court because Mrs. France and her
husband, Neil, were living on an Army base in Hawaii when the
shooting occurred Dec. 20, 1986.
   Prosecutors said Mrs. France shot her husband in the shoulder
after he took her beer from the refrigerator and put it in the
backyard. They said the couple had argued earlier in the day, and
that she became upset when he knocked over a Christmas tree.
   Mrs. France said her husband provoked the shooting by attacking
her. France testified that he believed the gun went off
accidentally, urged that his wife not be prosecuted and said they
were reconciling.
   In overturning Mrs. France's conviction last September, the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court relied upon a Supreme Court ruling the previous
June.
   In it, the high court said federal judges, to ensure an
impartial trial, may not delegate the task of presiding over jury
selection to magistrates. Federal judges, unlike magistrates, are
appointed for life to assure they will not be swayed improperly by
popular opinion.
   In the case decided last June, the defendants had objected to
having a magistrate preside over jury selection.
   Mrs. France made no such objection prior to her trial but the
9th Circuit court said the distinction has little significance.
   The appeals court said she should not be penalized for failing
to object to what, at the time of her trial, was the generally
accepted rule that magistrates could select juries.
   The appeals court, in an unusual move, also said federal
prosecutors were too harsh in charging Mrs. France under a 1984
federal law that carries a mandatory five-year prison term for
offenders.
   ``We ... have been left with the sense that Darlina France may
not be the sort of hardened, violent offender whom Congress had in
mind when it enacted'' the 1984 law, the appeals court said.
   Justice Department lawyers, in the appeal acted on today, said
Mrs. France forfeited her right to have jury selection conducted by
a federal judge because she failed to object to the magistrate's
role before trial.
   Dozens of convictions could be thrown out if the 9th Circuit
court ruling is not reversed, the government lawyers said. The 9th
Circuit court has jurisdiction in Hawaii, Alaska, Arizona,
California, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Washington state.
   The case is U.S. vs. France, 89-1363.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Virginia Action Against Charity Fund-Raisers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
Virginia officials seeking more power to prevent fraud by
businesses that solicit charitable donations.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that lets federal
judges block some anti-fraud measures for violating free-speech
rights.
   The dispute stems from an investigation by Virginia consumer
protection officials into the conduct of Telco Communications,
which raises funds for police organizations and firefighter unions.
   The state Office of Consumer Affairs said it received complaints
that Telco was misleading potential donors. For example, the state
said, one solicitor allegedly lied and claimed he was a volunteer.
   State officials met with Telco officials in 1988 without
reaching any resolution. About two weeks later, the company sued in
federal court to block the state from taking any action.
   The state said the federal judge should not interfere,
particularly since the state's investigation was incomplete. But
the judge ruled against the consumer protection office.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last September upheld much
of the judge's ruling.
   The appeals court said federal judges may bar state enforcement
in such cases ``where state proceedings were in a preliminary stage
and where the state had imposed a prior restraint upon protected
speech.'' Otherwise, the appeals court said, it ``would leave a
party's constitutional rights in limbo while an agency contemplates
enforcement but does not undertake it.''
   The appeals court said there no longer is a live controversy
over one of the state's anti-fraud laws that required professional
solicitors to tell potential donors how much of their contributions
will go to the charities.
   A Supreme Court ruling in 1988 prohibits such laws, the appeals
court said.
   The appeals court also struck down a Virginia regulation that
solicitors must submit to the state, in advance, a written script
of what it tells potential donors. That kind of review by the state
amounts to an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech, the
appeals court said.
   But the 4th Circuit court upheld a Virginia regulation requiring
solicitors to tell potential donors in writing that the
fund-raiser's financial statements are available from the state
consumer affairs office.
   The appeals court refused to decide whether the state may
suspend or revoke a fund-raiser's right to do business for
violating the anti-fraud rules. It would be premature to decide
that issue since Telco was not accused of violating any
regulations, the appeals court said.
   The case is Carbaugh vs. Telco Communications, 89-1311.

   A frail-looking Robert Polhill,
the first American released by pro-Iranian Lebanese captors in
nearly 3{ years, walked slowly off a plane today after winning
freedom with the aid of Syria and Iran.
   Doctors who later examined the 55-year-old educator said he was
malnourished and mildly dehydrated.
   Polhill's release Sunday after 1,182 days of captivity was
followed by a reported call by Iran's foreign minister for a swift
reciprocal move _ freedom for a Shiite Moslem cleric kidnapped by
Israeli troops in July.
   President Bush thanked Iran and Syria _ whose military forces in
Lebanon picked up Polhill in west Beirut and drove him to the
Syrian capital of Damascus _ for their help in securing the release.
   But the president said he would make no deals with the
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants in Lebanon still holding 17
Western hostages, seven of them Americans.
   An Iranian newspaper close to that country's president, Hashemi
Rafsanjani, today called on the Lebanese kidnappers to release
another American hostage immediately and without conditions.
   Rafsanjani is among Iranian leaders seeking better relations
with the West. The Bush administration has expressed willingness to
improve ties if the hostage crisis is settled.
   And in Beirut, Hussein Musawi, a leading pro-Iranian Shiite
cleric, said today that freeing another Western hostage was ``in
the cards.'' But he stressed there must first be reciprocity on the
part of Washington.
   Musawi, interviewed by the communist-run Voice of the People,
said: ``The possibility of another release is in the cards, but I
don't know when, how or for what.
   ``Such a step (Polhill's release) has to have a reciprocation.
It is not feasible that all releases would be made as goodwill
gestures,'' he said.
   He refused to speculate on which hostage might be freed next.
   U.S. officials said today in Wiesbaden that they had no
information about another U.S. hostage being released. They said
they were ``not aware of any message for Bush'' Polhill may have
brought from his captors.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Polhill
was kept in the same building as American hostages Jesse Turner and
Alann Steen, but ``he probably doesn't know about Terry Anderson or
Terry Waite.''
   Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, was kidnapped on March 16, 1985. He has been held the
longest of the foreign hostages. Waite, 50, British envoy of the
Anglican Church, disappeared in Lebanon on Jan. 20, 1987.
   Polhill, a New Yorker, looked extremely frail today and was
hunched over as he came down the steps of the U.S. Air Force C-141
at Rhein-Main air base in a cold rain, supported by two airmen.
   He was dressed in a military camouflage jacket and carried a
football given to him as ``a touch of America'' under one arm
during the short walk to a military van.
   About two dozen people nearby applauded, and the gaunt Polhill
responded with a wave. A helicopter whisked the freed hostage and
his Lebanese wife, Feryal, to a U.S. military hospital in nearby
Wiesbaden.
   ``Welcome home, pray for the others,'' read one banner hung
outside the hospital, where Polhill began medical tests and was to
be debriefed by U.S. intelligence agents.
   Military spokesman Cmdr. John Woodhouse said Polhill's stay at
the hospital, which has received other freed U.S. hostages, could
be anywhere from ``a couple of days to a few weeks.''
   ``He is alert, stable, ambulatory and somewhat tired,'' said a
medical bulletin based on Polhill's first two hours in the
hospital. ``Although he appears to be in relatively good shape, he
is malnourished and mildly dehydrated.''
   It said doctors would also make an evaluation of Polhill's
diabetes, which he has had for 25 years.
   Polhill arrived at the hospital saying he was hungry, and
quickly downed a breakfast of grapefruit, scrambled eggs, bacon,
English muffins, milk and coffee.
   The ex-hostage later had a ``relaxed conversation with medical
staff,'' according to the statement.
   About 100 people cheered and clapped as Polhill arrived in
Wiesbaden.
   In Damascus, the business professor said his unrelenting anger
at his captors had kept him alive and sane during the ordeal. He
also said that his joy at being free was tempered by the knowledge
that others were still held.
   ``I was angry at what was being done to me, being taken away
from my wife and family,'' he told a Syrian TV reporter as he was
being driven from Beirut to Damascus. ``And so I strived to
continue being angry, knowing at all times that if I began to lose
that anger I'd just sort of become a vegetable.''
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, said in New York
after the release that Iran and the Shiite factions in Lebanon want
the Israelis to release Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid in return, the
official Syrian Arab News Agency reported. Obeid was kidnapped in
south Lebanon.
   The Tehran Times, which is close to Rafsanjani, said in an
editorial today that as long as Israel still holds scores of Arab
prisoners, the captors ``will certainly find it hard to comply''
with the request for more releases.
   ``But perhaps the release of one hostage alone will not be
enough to establish the kind of overwhelming trust needed to bring
the whole hostage crisis to an end,'' it said.
   Though pale and apparently fatigued, Polhill managed to joke
with reporters shortly after being turned over to U.S. Ambassador
Edward Djerejian in Syria.
   ``The first thing I'd like to say is that I'm sorry I kept you
waiting so long,'' he told a news conference at the Syrian Foreign
Ministry.
   Polhill was abducted along with two other professors from Beirut
University College on Jan. 24, 1987 by the Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine. The group still holds the other two: Jesse
Turner, 42, of Boise, Idaho, and Alann Steen, a 51-year-old Boston
native.
   The last American hostage to be freed was David Jacobsen, former
director of the American University Hospital in Beirut. He was
kidnapped in Beirut on May 28, 1985, and released Nov. 2, 1986. He
had been held by another Shiite faction, Islamic Jihad, or Holy War.

<HEAD>Court Agrees to Decide Prison Inmate Issue in Colorado Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether prison inmates who testify in federal court proceedings
should be paid witness fees.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by a Colorado state prison
inmate seeking compensation for testifying at a 1988 federal trial.
   The inmate, Richard S. Demarest, testified for the defendant on
March 15, 1988. He said he should be entitled to the same fee as
anyone else who is a witness in federal court.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last September that
federal law does not require that prisoners be paid for appearing
at federal trials.
   ``Beyond their loss of the very modest compensation they might
receive from participating in prison jobs programs, prisoners
generally do not incur financial costs serving as witnesses,'' the
appeals court said.
   The appeals courted noted that the $30-a-day witness fee is much
more that inmates make working in prison industries.
   Demarest, for example, is paid $40 a month in his job at the
Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility in Crowley, Colorado.
   The appeals court said paying prisoners could lead to abuses
since it would tempt inmates, who number in the millions, to file
suits and then subpoena inmate friends to testify.
   The Bush administration urged the Supreme Court to reject
Demarest's appeal.
   The case is Demarest vs. Manspeaker, 89-5916.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear the
appeal of Georgia death row inmate James A. Ford, convicted of
kidnapping and killing a Newnan gas station manager in 1984.
   The court said it will decide whether Ford is entitled to a new
trial because prosecutors used so-called ``peremptory challenges''
to exclude blacks from the jury.
   The justices in 1986 barred prosecutors from disqualifying
potential jurors based on their race. And in 1987, they said that
the 1986 ruling was to be applied retroactively to perhaps hundreds
of other convicted defendants.
   But Georgia courts refused to apply the Supreme Court decisions
in Ford's case.
   Today, the justices said they will judge the validity of the
Georgia courts' refusal.
   Ford was convicted of killing Sarah Dean after taking her from a
gas station on March 1, 1984.
   Ms. Dean's ody was found locked in the trunk of her car, which
was submerged in a pond. Police said she had drowned.
   The case is Ford vs. Georgia, 87-6796.

<TEXT>
   Government warplanes dropped cluster bombs
in two raids on the guerrilla-held Red Sea port of Massawa, killing
50 civilians and wounding 110, Ethiopian rebels said today.
   The Eritrean People's Liberation Front said it expected the
death toll to rise from Sunday's attacks as most of the wounded
were in ``very bad condition,'' according to a clandestine radio
report monitored in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi.
   About 50 houses were destroyed in the mid-morning and early
evening raids, the radio said.
   The rebel-operated Voice of the Broad Masses of Eritrea gave no
further details of the air strikes, the latest since secessionist
guerrillas captured Massawa from government forces in February.
   The report on the air raids could not be independently verified.
   Massawa is one of two strategic harbors that traditionally
handle most of Ethiopia's trade and relief supplies for millions of
people threatened with starvation in the face of war, drought and
poor harvests.
   The Eritrean Front has been fighting for control of Ethiopia's
northernmost province since 1961, a year after the former Italian
colony lost political autonomy and was forcibly annexed by the late
Emperor Haile Selassie as a province.
   Rebels hold other towns and villages in Eritrea and, with
backing from other guerrilla armies, are seeking to overthrow
Marxist President Mengistu Haile Mariam.
   The rebel radio has reported several previous raids by warplanes
dropping cluster bombs and napalm on civilians. They have been
denied by the Addis Ababa government.
   Israel has been accused of supplying the cluster bombs, which
contain dozens of smaller grenade-like bomblets that hurl shrapnel
over wide areas.
   Both Israel and Ethiopia have denied these claims.

   Old habits die hard, even for the
environmentally aware.
   After Earth Day 1990 activities Sunday, the grounds of the old
state capitol and the Centroplex auditorium were strewn with beer
cans, soda cups, hamburger wrappers and other rubbish.
   ``You're not going to change people's actions overnight,'' said
local Earth Day chairman Paul Davidson. ``I'd like to think it's
cleaner than at past festivals, but I don't know.''
   City worker Bonnie Miles and his seven-member cleanup crew
worked for three hours, filling about 65 trash bins to overflowing.
   Several volunteers also stuck around to help clean up.
   Cathy Hickman dragged around a 30-gallon trash bag filled with
aluminum cans, which can be recycled.
   ``I started out with one of those (convenience store) bags with
two handles, and I ended up with this one,'' she said.

   Chinese Premier Li Peng arrived today for the
first visit in 26 years by a Chinese head of government to the
Soviet Union, China's longtime rival for leadership of the
Communist world.
   The four-day trip is to promote normal relations and ease border
tensions at a time when both countries are confronted with serious
domestic problems.
   The 61-year-old premier was expected to hold at least two rounds
of talks with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who last May went to
China in the first visit by a Soviet leader in three decades.
   ``Li's visit to the U.S.S.R. underscores the importance of
continuing the Sino-Soviet dialogue at the summit level, which
began a year ago and signalled the normalization of relations,''
the Tass news agency said.
   Li was met at the airport by Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov and Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   ``I will be exchanging views with President Gorbachev, Chairman
Ryzhkov and other comrades from the Soviet leadership on matters
concerning bilateral relations and on major international issues of
common concern,'' Li said at the airport.
   Tass said Ryzhkov and Peng began meeting Monday but did not
report what they were discussing.
   Gorbachev's historic visit to China was overshadowed by
student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing, which ended
weeks later when Li and other Chinese leaders sent in troops to
crush the movement.
   In Moscow, Gorbachev is contending with the crisis in Lithuania,
which declared independence March 11.
   The official Chinse press, before Li's departure, said his trip
would have ``profound significance'' on peace in Asia and the world.
   China and the Soviet Union split over ideological differences in
1960 and fought a brief border war in 1969. In 1972, China restored
relations with the United States, in part because then-leader Mao
Tse-tung saw the Soviet Union as China's most serious military
threat.
   Western diplomats in Beijing said China has stressed it will
never be a docile Soviet ally as it was in the 1950s, and they
noted that China's inherent suspicions of Soviet aims have grown
with Gorbachev's reform policies.
   The ideological hard-liners who now rule China reportedly blame
Gorbachev for the fall of Communist parties in Eastern Europe and
see perestroika _ Gorbachev's program of political and economic
reform _ as leading to the demise of socialism.
   Tass said both the Soviet Union and China agreed that the latest
rounds of talks will not presage a return to the relationship of
the 1950s, ``but the departure from the confrontation that existed
in the past.''
   The news agency said the two sides have shown readiness to
reduce troops deployed in the area of the Soviet-Chinese border and
have agreed to a treaty on the reductions.
   It said the current talks will enable the two countries to
improve cooperation in trade, economic, scientific-technical,
cultural and other areas.
   The last Chinese premier to visit Moscow was Li's foster father,
Chou-En-lai, who met then-Soviet leaders Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei
Kosygin in 1964.
   Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Deputy Chief of General
Staff Xu Xin and Li's wife, Zhu Lin, accompanied the premier on his
visit.

<HEAD>White House Says No Deals For Hostages</HEAD>

   The White House said today that the United
States will not deal for hostages, and it will take the
unconditional release of all those still in captivity in Lebanon to
``open the door towards better relations with Iran.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said preliminary reports
from a U.S. Air Force hospital in Wiesbaden, West Germany, indicate
Robert Polhill ``is malnourished and dehydrated, but ... in
relatively good condition'' after being freed Sunday after 39
months in captivity.
   Fitzwater did not say what the United States would do next, but
said, ``We are not going to trade for hostages, however, or make
deals.''
   ``We do not know what was the specific motivation for the
release. We have always believed that Iran has control or at least
influence over the hostage holders,'' he said. ``Iran has been
supportive of Mr. Polhill's release. We appreciate that.''
   He said debriefing of Polhill was just beginning. ``The only
information we have is that he was with (fellow teachers Jesse)
Turner and (Alann) Steen throughout most of his captivity, up until
the last few days. But I don't have any other details, other than
they are alive and he was with them.''
   He echoed the hard line that Bush struck after learning of the
release Sunday while fishing off the Florida Keys.
   ``As the president said yesterday, we want the release of all
hostages. That would open the door towards better relations with
Iran,'' said Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said the United States is ``also looking for an
accounting as to the status of the two missing hostages _ William
Buckley and Lt. Col. Richard Higgins'' _ both believed killed by
their captors.
   Bush said he would make no gesture towards Iran or others until
all the hostages are free.
   ``This is a mission uncompleted. There are other Americans held
against their will,'' Bush said in Islamorada, Fla., after speaking
by telephone with Polhill.
   John Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern
and South Asian affairs, said today that Bush's policy on the
hostages ``is very clear. We don't make deals.''
   However, Kelly, appearing on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, said
``we're going to be talking to the Syrians. We have been in contact
indirectly with Iran and we're going to keep working as hard as we
can on this issue.'' Asked if release of another hostage was
imminent, Kelly said ``it's too early to say with any certainty
whether that will be the case but we certainly hope it is.''
   Bush's initial written reaction made a small bow in Iran's
direction.
   The written statement thanked ``those who had a hand in the
release, particularly the governments of Syria and Iran whose
efforts have contributed to the release of this hostage.''
   Syria's role was obvious, as its diplomats arranged to pick
Polhill up in Beirut from his captors then whisked him to safety in
Damascus.
   However, Bush omitted Iran from his words of appreciation in a
face-to-face meeting with reporters. He said, ``I can't tell you I
honestly know what (Iran's role in the release) is. But I'd have
goodwill to those who facilitated the release. If that included
Iran, absolutely.''
   His spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said, ``There were no deals, no
negotiations with the hostage-takers. We have no way of identifying
any specific action on our part that could have been a contributing
factor'' to the release.
   Bush, who last week refused the kidnappers' request that he send
envoy John Kelly to Damascus, said he felt ``great joy,'' but ``I
don't have forgiveness in my heart as long as one American is held
against his will.''
   ``I will carry the burden of the other hostages with me until
every single one of them is free,'' he said. ``There's not a night
goes by that I don't think about it.''
   The Tehran Times newspaper said in an editorial today that
another hostage should be freed to test ``President Bush's claim
that `goodwill begets goodwill.''' Meanwhile, Iran's foreign
minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, was quoted today by the official
Syrian Arab News Agency as saying the pro-Iranian extremists in
Lebanon wanted a quick reciprocal move.
   The United States maintains that Iran has influence over the
groups still holding the Americans and 10 other Westerners in
Lebanon.
   The hostages include Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, kidnapped on March 16,
1985. Polhill was a hostage for almost 39 months, along with two
fellow American teachers at Beirut University College who ignored
U.S. warnings to leave the war-torn country.
   Bush told reporters on Sunday, ``I'm not trying to think up any
gestures'' to make toward Iran.
   ``I'm not making gestures. I don't trade for hostages. I don't
go ante up, one step and another,'' he said.
   On the Soviet crackdown against Lithuania, Bush said he has not
yet decided what action to take. The White House said Friday that
Bush would confer with leaders of Congress early this week after
completing consultations with U.S. allies.
   Bush received word of Polhill's release by ship-to-shore phone
as he was fishing in the Everglades with national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft and other.
   Bush began his observance of Sunday's Earth Day on an Islamorada
beach at sunrise, honoring activists who work to protect the Keys'
coral reefs and announcing an effort to declare the waters within
10 miles of the Keys off limits to big ships and oil freighters.

   Civil rights leaders sent up a chorus of praise
for the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, saying they preferred to
remember him for his contributions to the cause rather than for the
controversy that followed him to the grave.
   About 2,000 people attended a memorial service Sunday at the
Baptist church where the Rev. Martin Luther King's closest friend
and chief lieutenant had been pastor since 1961. Abernathy died of
a heart attack Tuesday at age 64.
   Officials at Abernathy's church, West Hunter Street Baptist,
said about 2,500 people had filed through the church Sunday and
this morning to pay their respects.
   Funeral services were scheduled for this afternoon at the
church. Abernathy was to be taken to his crypt at a in a mule-drawn
wagon, the symbol of humility he had suggested for King's funeral.
The motorcade was to travel along Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.
   Among those who had worked closely with Abernathy, gone was any
trace of outrage for writing in his autobiography about King's
alleged marital infidelity. Abernathy was branded a Judas last year
because of the passages.
   ``There's always been unity, even when there's been
disagreement,'' said former Mayor Andrew Young, now a candidate for
governor. ``I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing now if Ralph had not
been where he was, doing what he was doing.''
   ``We must judge him on what he meant to our struggle, and he was
high up on the honor roll,'' said Jesse Jackson. ``I think those
who would focus on a point they may disagree on must mix the bitter
with the sweet, and it comes out much sweeter.''
   Abernathy, who with King founded the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, worked with him to organize the Montgomery,
Ala., bus boycott, marched with him in Selma, Ala., and in
Washington, and cradled his bloody head when he was cut down by an
assassin's bullet in Memphis, Tenn., in 1968.
   ``At every great, critical moment, he was present,'' Jackson
said. ``Very few people can say their fingerprints are on each wall
that fell down.''
   On Sunday, mourners, some carrying children, walked past the
coffin, and several touched the sleeves of Abernathy's white
ministerial robe. Those attending included Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
and Martin Luther King III.
   Abernathy had written his own epitaph, ``I tried.''
   ``Yes, Ralph, you did try,'' said the Rev. Robert G. Grant,
president of the American Freedom Coalition in Washington. ``You
tried to bring your people those normal things of life that most
people take for granted.''

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Give New Lift to Suit Over Shirley MacLaine Book</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: CORRECTS spelling of MacLaine in 3rd graf, bgng, Silva's
suit...</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to give new
life to a copyright lawsuit over actress Shirley MacLaine's 1983
best-selling book, ``Out on a Limb.''
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that MacLaine's
book about reincarnation and other spiritual subjects did not
infringe the copyright of a 1977 book written by Charles Silva.
   Silva's suit sought monetary damages from MacLaine and the
American Broadcasting Companies Inc., which in 1987 made a
television movie based on the book.
   Silva, from Peru, authored ``Date With the Gods'' in 1977, and
sent a copy to MacLaine. She later discussed it with him, and
eventually traveled with him to areas of Peru described in his book.
   Silva's book tells of his asserted encounters with an
extraterrestrial woman high in the Andes mountains.
   As described by U.S. District Judge Horace Gilmore, ``Date With
the Gods'' does not discuss reincarnation in detail but implies
that when one dies, his spirit might become embodied in another
living form.
   Silva's suit was filed in Detroit. His book's publisher, Living
Waters Publishing and Distributing Inc., is based in Bloomfield
Hills, Mich.
   Gilmore dismissed Silva's suit after concluding that there is
``no substantial similarity'' between the two books.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Gilmore's ruling
last Nov. 7.
   The case is Silva vs. MacLaine, 89-1475.

<HEAD>Court Sets Aside Ruling in Minnesota Amish Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today raised the possibility
that Minnesota officials may enforce a traffic safety law against
certain members of an Amish sect in rural Fillmore County.
   The court set aside a Minnesota Supreme Court ruling that barred
such enforcement.
   The justices told the state court to reconsider the case in
light of their decision last week allowing states to outlaw the
religious use of the illegal drug peyote.
   In a brief order today issued over two dissenting votes, the
court said the Minnesota court should restudy the Amish controversy
after examining the peyote ruling from Oregon.
   In that case, members of the Native American Church contended
that punishing the religious use of peyote violated religious
freedom.
   In the Minnesota case, the state Supreme Court ruled that
requiring the Amish to display a ``slow-moving vehicle'' warning
emblem on the back of their horse-drawn buggies violated their
religious freedom.
   A state law requires that slow-moving vehicles display a
yellow-orange triangular emblem to warn other drivers. The law
provided for one alternative _ a black and white triangular emblem.
   Not all members of the Amish sect living in Fillmore County, in
southeastern Minnesota near the Iowa border, object to the emblem.
But 14 who did were issued citations for refusing to attach the
emblems to their black buggies.
   The 14 say the loud colors and worldly symbols conflict with
Biblical admonitions against putting their faith in anything but
God.
   A state trial judge ruled that enforcing the traffic law against
the 14 Amish members did not violate any right, but the Minnesota
Supreme Court unanimously threw out all charges against them last
August.
   The state's highest court ruled that the requirement infringed
on the exercise of a sincerely held religious belief and, most
importantly, the state's compelling interest in traffic safety
could be served by a less-restrictive requirement.
   Noting that the Amish do not object to outlining their buggies
with silver reflective tape or to displaying red lit lanterns to
supplement the tape, the state Supreme Court said, ``There does
exist a less restrictive alternative to serve the state's public
safety concerns.''
   In the appeal acted on today, County Attorney Robert R. Benson
argued that the state court ``impermissibly advances religion by
allowing the Amish special rights, which individuals outside that
religious group cannot enjoy.''
   Lawyers for the Amish said Benson is wrong.
   ``There is ample room for legislatures and courts to craft
religious accommodations and yet not establish (or advance)
religion,'' they said. ``The Minnesota Supreme Court ... has not
established religion by allowing the Amish to use reflective tape
and the traditional red lantern on their buggies instead of forcing
them to use an orange fluorescent or black worldly symbol.''
   Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor dissented
from the high court's action today, without stating their reasons.
   The case is Minnesota vs. Hershberger, 89-804.

   About 100 inmates remained on the roof
of a prison on the outskirts of Bristol today following a night of
violence that left three guards injured.
   Authorities also reported overnight trouble at Long Lartin, a
high security prison in Evesham, northwest of London, where an
inmate took another prisoner hostage and held him in a cell at
knifepoint.
   Authorites speculated that the disturbance at the Pucklechurch
Remand Center near Bristol in western England may have been
inspired by the riot 23 days ago at Manchester's Strangeways Prison.
   Seven inmates remained on the Strangeways' roof today while
prison negotiators continued what they called their ``softly,
softly'' strategy for talking the men down.
   Officials at Pucklechurch said they would be more aggressive
about retaking the wing of the facility held by the prisoners.
   ``Our intention is to retake the occupied areas of the
establishment as quickly as possible using the minimum amount of
force necessary for that aim,'' said Mick Cook, a spokesman for
Pucklechurch.
   It was not known what caused the riot at Pucklechurch. The
Strangeways riot was sparked by overcrowding, but authorities said
Pucklechurch is not overcrowded.
   At Pucklechurch, about 120 inmates snatched a prison officer
late Sunday as they returned from the exercise yard. They took away
his keys, released other prisoners and then freed him less than an
hour later, authorities said.
   The prisoners climbed on the roof and began hurling missiles
onto the staff.
   Three prison officers were injured, including one officer who
required hospitalization after being hit in the face with a brick.
Before dawn today, prison staff had retaken the central wing, one
of three wings in the male section, authorities said.
   A Home Office spokesman, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said 20 prisoners had given themselves up. The inmates
who spent the night on the roof, lit fires to keep warm.
   The remaining prisoners were locked in the other wings, and more
than 40 female prisoners were moved out of Pucklechurch.
   A senior member of the prison staff said special contingency
plans had been put into operation, and officers from other prisons
trained in control and restraint techniques, were called in to the
scene.
   The Home Office spokesman said there were no indications over
the weekend that a disturbance was likely.
   At Long Lartin, efforts continued through the night to persuade
the captor to give up his victim, but the rest of the jail was
quiet, the Home Office spokesman said.
   It was not known if the hostage-taker had made any specific
demands.
   On April 4, prison staff at Long Lartin foiled a breakout
attempt by nine inmates who were caught as they cut through an
inner perimeter wire fence. At the same time, 32 other inmates
staged a demonstration and barricaded themselves into one of the
prison's wings for 13 hours before surrendering.

<HEAD>Court to Use Mississippi Death Row Inmate to Provide Questioning
Guidelines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to use the case
of a Mississippi death row inmate to provide new guidelines for
police questioning of suspects.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Robert S. Minnick, a
convicted murderer who said his confession was unlawful because he
was denied his right to have a lawyer present.
   Minnick and James ``Monkey'' Dyess escaped from Clarke County,
Miss., jail in April 1986 and went looking for guns, authorities
said.
   Police said the two men fatally shot Donald Ellis Thomas and
Lamar Lafferty when the victims returned to Thomas's mobile home to
find Minnick and Dyess there.
   Minnick was arrested in Lemon Grove, Calif., on Aug. 22, 1986.
FBI agents ended their questioning of him when he asked for a
lawyer. Minnick then met with an attorney who advised him not to
answer any more questions.
   A few days later, Deputy Sheriff J.C. Denham of Clarke County
flew to California and questioned Minnick. The defendant confessed
to murder, saying he shot Lafferty because Dyess was threatening to
kill Minnick if he did not.
   Minnick was convicted in Mississippi and sentenced to death.
   He said in his appeal that his rights were violated because he
never agreed to talk to Denham without a lawyer present.
   The Mississippi Supreme Court upheld his conviction, ruling use
of the confession was lawful.
   The state court said since Minnick previously had talked to a
lawyer but still agreed to speak to Denham, his right to have a
lawyer was not violated.
   The state court said Denham's questioning of Minnick did not
violate the rule the U.S. Supreme Court established in 1981 when it
barred police from questioning a suspect who has asked for a lawyer
unless the suspect initiates the conversation.
   The case is Minnick vs. Mississippi, 89-6332.

<TEXT>
   Lithuanian President Vytautas
Landsbergis said today that Mikhail S. Gorbachev is staking
everything on the Lithuanian crisis by not excluding the use of
Soviet troops in the Baltic republic.
   Landsbergis also asked the Lithuanian parliament, the Supreme
Council, to draw up emergency plans to deal with mass layoffs
expected in the republic because of the Kremlin's economic blockade.
   The republic of 3.8 million began its first full work week since
the Soviet president cut off supplies of oil, natural gas and other
raw materials to the republic, which declared independence on March
11.
   Vilnius' main thouroughfare, Gedimina Street, was practically
devoid of vehicles today as Lithuanians struggled with gasoline
rationing that limits them to about seven gallons per month. Bus
service among cities also was curtailed sharply.
   On Sunday Lithuania halted exports to Soviet republics and
foreign customers, claiming Moscow was imposing a total embargo.
But also Sunday, a visiting Soviet official denied any general
blockade existed.
   The British Broadcasting Corp., meanwhile, quoted Gorbachev's
senior military adviser, Marshall Sergei Akhromeyev, as saying the
Red Army won't hesitate to use force to crush illegal protests in
Lithuania.
   ``If the Lithuanian separatists break the law, then we will take
measures to enforce the law. I am not afraid of using force if
necessary,'' he said in an interview for broadcast on the BBC's
``Panorama'' program.
   When asked about Akhromeyev's comments, Lithuanian President
Vytautas Landsbergis told reporters: ``We must worry about such
insanity. It's military madness. Force is always a real threat as
long as there is no willingness to use politics. If they use force
in Lithuania, it means they would be prepared to use force in the
world.''
   According to a parliamentary spokeswoman, Rita Dapkus,
Landsbergis later told lawmakers that by refusing to rule out the
use of force, Gorbachev was staking everything. The Lithuanian
president used card-players' slang that Gorbachev was ``playing the
bank'' _ literally risking all.
   ``There are signs from the U.S.S.R. that raise worries,''
Landsbergis added, according to Ms. Dapkus. ``President Gorbachev
is being placed in the artificial position that plays the role of
putting the rest of the world into a dilemma of whom to support _
Lithuania or Gorbachev.''
   Ms. Dapkus said Landsbergis called this ``an artificial ploy.''
   Soviet troops have used force twice already, to round up
Lithuanian army deserters and to occupy a Vilnius printing plant.
   In Moscow, Arkady Maslennikov, Gorbachev's press secretary, said
today the Kremlin might negotiate with Lithuania if it freezes its
declaration of independence for two years.
   But Maslennikov made it clear the breakaway republic also would
have to admit it is subject to the Soviet Constitution. Lithuanian
leaders refuse to do that, saying the republic was forcibly annexed
by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   Soviet leaders are willing to talk to Lithuanian officials if
they acknowledge jurisdiction of the Soviet Constitution ``either
by rescinding or freezing'' the independence decisions, Maslennikov
said at a press briefing.
   Over the weekend, Landsbergis denied reports the declaration of
independence would be frozen for two years in hopes of reaching a
compromise with Moscow.
   Maslennikov said he did not know if any Soviet leaders would
meet a Lithuanian delegation that arrived today. ``It depends on
what they've come with.''
   Ms. Dapku quoted Landsbergis as saying parliament should draft
an emergency plan for when Gorbachev's economic blockade starts
throwing Lithuanians out of work.
   ``We have to think about what we will suggest to the people, how
to act in an extreme situation when they will lose their jobs,''
she quoted him as saying.
   The embargo is expected to take jobs from 70 percent of the
republic's workforce of 500,000 people.
   Landsbergis referred to Gorbachev's embargo as a ``total
blockade.''
   A Soviet official on Sunday denied that any general blockade
existed.
   ``Plans for a total blockade don't exist,'' said Andrei N.
Girenko, a Communist Party Central Committee member.
   However, Lithuanian Deputy Premier Romualdas Ozolas said Sunday
Lithuanian ports have stopped loading goods bound for foreign
countries and stopped sending some products to other Soviet
republics.
   Lithuania said in a telegram to Soviet Premier Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov the Soviet cutoff would choke Lithuanian processing and
manufacturing of goods meant both for export and for the Soviet
domestic market.
   A Leningrad journalist said today long lines already were
forming at gasoline stations in that city as residents feared that
refined petroleum products processed in Lithuania would be cut back.
   Gorbachev said last week he would halt the shipment to Lithuania
of exportable products unless Lithuania backs away from measures
furthering its independence decree.
   An embargo on oil and most natural gas began Wednesday and
Ozolas said Lithuania's only oil refinery, at Mazhiekiai, would
shut down today.
   Lithuania and itsd Baltic neighbors Latvia and Estonia are
trying to restore independence lost in 1940 when they were forcibly
annexed by the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   President Bush will meet on Tuesday with
congressional leaders to discuss a U.S. response to the Soviet
Union's economic blockade of Lithuania, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said today.
   ``We don't want to give any indication to what actions we might
take,'' Fitzwater. He declined to comment on speculation that the
United States might postpone planned trade and investment
assistance to the Soviet Union.
   However, Fitzwater said, ``I rule out no options.''
   U.S.-Soviet trade liberalization talks were scheduled to begin
in Paris on Tuesday.
   ``The decision has not been made by the president yet. It
depends upon analysis being conducted by the NSC (National Security
Council) and the State Department at this time,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush was to meet with congressional leaders Tuesday morning.
   ``We may or may not have an announcement at that time,''
Fitzwater said.
   Asked about news reports suggesting a possible framework for
negotiations between Moscow and the rebellious Baltic state,
Fitzwater said: ``The statements this morning do appear to show
some flexibility. We are hopeful that's the case.''
   ``We have urged peaceful dialogue as a way of resolving this
issue. It's impossible for us to know exactly what these statements
this morning mean. But if they are indicative of the two sides
being able to get together, that's a welcome sign,'' Fitzwater said.
   Meanwhile, Fitzwater announced that a planned meeting between
Alexsandr Yakovley, the Soviet Communist Party secretary, and Vice
President Dan Quayle had been postponed.

<HEAD>Senators Got $96 Million From PACs In 1983-1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Incumbent senators received more than $96
million in donations from political action committees from 1983
through 1988, a group seeking restrictions on such donations said
Tuesday.
   Four senators received more than $2 million from PACs, according
to Common Cause, one of several groups lobbying for an overhaul of
campaign finance laws.
   The group said 44 of the 99 incumbents received at least $1
million in PAC money during the six-year period.
   The totals were compiled from Federal Election Commission data.
Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, who died earlier this month, was
not included.
   The four senators whose PAC donations from 1983-88 exceeded $2
million were: Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, $2.5 million; Pete Wilson,
R-Calif., $2.3 million; Slade Gorton, R-Wash., $2.2 million; and
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, $2 million.
   Common Cause said finance-industry PACs _ those associated with
banks, savings and loans and other financial institutions _ were
the top contributors during the period.
   The top recipient of finance-industry PAC donations was Sen.
Donald Riegle, D-Mich., the chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, according to Common Cause. Riegle, the group said,
received $344,000 in such donations.
   Common Cause and its allies long have sought legislation to
outlaw PAC donations.
   The groups have focused this year on trying to persuade Congress
to adopt voluntary campaign spending caps. Those caps would include
a limit on how much of that money could come from PAC donations.
   Senate debate on the issue is expected to begin this week.

   An Iranian hunter was shot to death
Monday near Tehran by a snake that coiled itself around his shotgun
as he pinned the reptile to the ground, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted another hunter as
saying that the victim, Ali-Asghar Ahani, tried to catch the snake
alive by pressing the butt of his shotgun behind its head.
   But the snake coiled around the butt and accidentally pulled the
trigger with its thrashing tail, firing one of the barrels and
shooting Ahani in the head, IRNA said.
   The other hunter tried to grab the shotgun, but the writhing
reptile triggered the other barrel, the agency said.
   ``I was lucky not to get hurt,'' the unidentified man was quoted
as saying.

<TEXT>
   ALONG THE CEASE-FIRE LINE, Kashmir, Pakistan (AP) _ Gunfire
erupts nightly along the cease-fire line that weaves through the
spectacular snow-covered peaks and lush, freshly tilled valleys of
disputed Kashmir.
   Pakistani and Indian soldiers crouched in their camouflaged
bunkers only yards apart routinely take pot shots at each other,
raising fears that a fourth war could break out between the two
nations.
   ``Any time any place they can come, we can take them,'' Col.
Naeem Abid of Pakistan boasted from his commamd center at Pandu,
overlooking one of the most explosive spots along a cease-fire line
that splits the former princely state of Kashmir between India and
Paksitan.
   A Pakistani flag still flies from an Indian bunker at Chakhoti,
thousands of feet almost directly below Pandu.
   ``They are afraid we will shoot at them if they try to take it
down,'' Abid said. ``There is fear in their minds.''
   Three Pakistanis died putting that flag up in February. They
were shot when Indian border guards opened fire on a crowd of
several thousand people, mostly students, who swarmed across the
border.
   Keeping the flag in place has now become a matter of pride for
the Pakistan soldiers guarding the area, Abid said.
   Time passes slowly for soldiers manning the remote peaks of the
Pir Panjal mountain range. Foreign journalists visited their
bunkers Sunday during a helicopter tour of the cease-fire line
arranged by Pakistan's government.
   Both countries talk of war, and the latest rhetoric between the
governments in Islamabad and New Delhi dominates long evening
conversations, Abid said.
   Twice the two neighbors have gone to war over Kashmir _ in 1948
and in 1965. A third war was fought over Bangladesh, or what was
then East Pakistan.
   ``If it's forced upon us, we'll ... teach them a lesson,'' Abid
said.
   The normal Indian troop strength along the 490-mile cease-fire
line is 245,000 military and paramilitary troops, said a Pakistan
Defense Ministry spokesman who cannot be identified under briefing
rules.
   The Indian government does not disclose such numbers.
   The Pakistani spokesman said India has deployed another 70,000
throughout Jammu-Kashmir state, India's only Moslem state.
   Most of those soldiers, he said, are assigned to quell a Moslem
secessionist uprising that has claimed at least 292 lives since
Jan. 20, when the Indian government ordered a crackdown.
   The militants once demanded that the Kashmir valley become part
of Pakistan, but now they want independence and the status of a
neutral nation.
   Pakistan has 100,000 soldiers along the cease-fire line, which
was negotiated and now monitored by U.N. peacekeeping forces.
   India regularly accuses Pakistan of fomenting violence in its
troubled state, a charge as often denied by Pakistan.
   The accusations have intensified in recent weeks, with each side
accusing the other of preparing for war.
   The foreign ministers of India and Pakistan are attending a U.N.
session on Third World economies in New York this week, and they
have indicated they may meet privately to try to defuse tensions
between their countries.
   From a helicopter flying along the cease-fire line Sunday, there
was little evidence of a troop buildup on Pakistan's side. Only
sporadic traffic moved on the roads snaking through the mountain
passes.
   ``Being on the border we have to be on maximum alert, be it day
or night,'' said Lt. Col Abdul Rasheed.
   He spoke from his isolated outpost 7,800 feet up in the
mountains at Chirikot. Rasheed's compound, with its labyrinth of
tunnels and underground bunkers, was the first stop on the
helicopter tour along the cease-fire line.
   Indian and Pakistani soldiers at Chirikot had exchanged gunfire
for about five hours on Saturday, he said.
   ``It happens every night,'' Rasheed said.
   Two days earlier, a 14-year-old girl was rushed to the hospital
with gunshot wounds, he said. ``They resort to shooting civilians.
We resent that,'' he said. ``They are intentionally provoking us.''
   New Delhi says civilians shot along the border are en route to
Pakistan for training and weapons to continue their violent
insurgency in Jammu-Kashmir.
   The entire population of the village of Khantawal, only miles
inside Indian-held Kashmir, fled to Pakistan about one week ago,
accusing Indian border guards of a litany of abuses.
   While Pakistan denies training and arming the militants,
thousands are reportedly in Pakistan-held Kashmir.
   In a small tent village on the grounds of an abandoned factory
in Muzzaffarabad, the capital of Azad (Free) Kashmir, about 70
young boys wait for weapons.
   ``We want weapons _ guns, rocket launchers, pistols,
everything,'' said Salim, 20, who uses only one name.
   ``But Pakistan still is not doing anything for us.''

   Junk bond king Michael Milken will not have to
name names of Wall Street cheats in exchange for being allowed to
plead guilty, a source says.
   The arrangement differs sharply from the deal reached by
Milken's accuser, Ivan Boesky, who was required to give evidence
against others in exchange for leniency after he was accused of
running an insider trading network in 1986.
   ``Part of Boesky's deal was he would cooperate and turn on
(others),'' a person who was briefed on Milken's plea deal said
Sunday. ``That has nothing to do with Michael Milken's settlement.''
   Milken, though, will face questioning from the Justice
Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission if his plea
is approved by U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood. Such questioning is
standard in criminal guilty pleas.
   ``That would be a real victory for him and I think a real
victory for his clients and the whole junk bond structure,'' Alan
Bromberg, a securities law professor at Southern Methodist
University, said of the reported terms of the plea bargain.
   Milken on Friday agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay
$600 million in penalties to settle charges contained in a 98-count
fraud and racketeering indictment handed up a year ago.
   Prosecutors are expected to recommend a prison term of about
five years for Milken. The $600 million fine is the largest ever
against an individual, and is said to cover both criminal and civil
penalties. After his indictment, Milken set aside about $700
million to guarantee payment in the event of conviction.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the deal
precludes any further criminal prosecution of Milken, who
spearheaded some of the biggest takeovers of the 1980s as head of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk bond department.
   Milken, 43, controlled a network of buyers and sellers in the
$200 billion market for the high-yield debt securities and was
widely believed to have knowledge the government may been able to
use in its probe of illicit trading.
   The U.S. Attorney's office had given Milken until last Friday to
accept a settlement or face a new, expanded indictment.
   Barring last-minute changes, Milken is to enter the guilty plea
on Tuesday. A hearing before Wood was scheduled for Tuesday
morning, according to the judge's office.
   Milken, his brother, Lowell, and former Drexel trader Bruce
Newberg were charged in the indictment, which alleged securities
law violations in several takeovers.
   The plea bargain contains no insider trading or racketeering
charges and the government agreed to drop its case against Lowell
Milken. That was said to be a key component of Milken's decision to
plead guilty. The specific charges in the plea were not revealed.
   Milken had maintained innocence since he was linked to illegal
trading in 1986 by Boesky, who pleaded guilty to one charge, paid
$100 million and cooperated with investigators. Boesky's testimony
led to convictions from or guilty pleas by several Wall Street
figures.
   Milken's plea agreement apparently does not settle charges
against Newberg. Lawyers for Newberg said Sunday they had not been
contacted by the government about their client's status.
   In a related case, Newberg was convicted last year of
racketeering and securities faud in connection with illegal tax
trading by Princeton-Newport Partners, a now-defunct securities
firm. He was sentenced to three months in prison.
   It also was unclear whether any action would be taken against
individuals who had received ``target letters'' from the government
last year indicating they would be charged in a new Milken
indictment.
   Drexel last year pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed to
pay $650 million to settle related fraud charges. The firm
collapsed in February and is liquidating.

   City Hall is trying to help an
elderly woman who went to visit a cemetery plot where she planned
to be buried alongside family members only to discover it was
already occupied by a stranger.
   Yong Yu Min, 78, said she purchased the plot at Cheras Catholic
Cemetery from the Kuala Lumpur City Hall in 1962 and that she had
hoped to be buried there one day alongside her sister and two
brothers.
   A few days ago, she discovered that her plot was occupied by the
remains of a man unknown to her. The Malay Mail Daily published her
story on Monday under the headline ``There is Someone in my Grave.''
   A City Hall official said the man in the grave died in 1987 and
was supposed to be buried in the nearby Protestant cemetery.
   Funeral directors put his body in plot No. 1865 in the Catholic
cemetery, instead of plot No. 1865 the Protestant one, she said.
   She said she did not understand why there had been no complaints
until now, but that City Hall would try to resolve the problem.

   A train carrying a caustic chemical and
crude oil derailed and exploded, spewing about 100,000 gallons of
oil and releasing a chemical cloud that forced 200 people to
evacuate.
   Twenty-nine cars in a 97-car Buffalo &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad
freight train jumped the tracks in a steep ravine along Buffalo
Creek late Sunday, John H. Bell, the railway's vice president, said
today.
   At the fire's peak, flames shooting several hundred feet high
could be seen 30 miles away. At midmorning, the fire was still
burning but was under control, authorities said.
   Bell said only a small amount of the spilled oil leaked into
Buffalo Creek, a tributary of the Allegheny River, and that it
didn't appear to be a threat to drinking water.
   In addition to the oil, one tanker leaked sodium hydroxide that
sent a chemical cloud drifting toward Worthington, causing 200
people to be moved from their homes overnight. All but 50 had
returned by midmorning, said Worthington Fire Chief Don Grafton.
   He said about 300 people were told to be on standby for possible
evacuation this morning but that the danger posed by the cloud
appeared to be easing.
   A dike collected most of the sodium hydroxide, a caustic
substance used to clean drains, Bell said. It can cause oil to
ignite, according to a 1980 Department of Transportation hazardous
materials handbook.
   At late morning, crews were using hoses to suck oil and sodium
hydroxide from the ground.
   ``What a weird time time for this to happen _ on Earth Day,''
said one resident, the Rev. Sharon Schwab. ``Maybe it will make
people begin to realize that we need to do things so this sort of
thing doesn't happen as often as it does now.'' She said she heard
a strange noise from the train ``like something was dragging or
hitting the tracks wrong'' before the accident.
   The 12 oil tankers that derailed carried more than 300,000
gallons of oil, Bell said. About 100,000 gallons ``give or take a
few thousand'' had leaked from four ruptured cars, he said. The
other eight oil tankers derailed but didn't rupture.
   Except for the tanker carrying the sodium hydroxide, the other
train cars carried miscellaneous freight.
   Firefighters had the fire under control ``to a point'' when
officials decided to let the oil burn away, said Bob Walker, the
director of hazardous materials handling for Armstrong County's
emergency services office.
   ``There's product in Buffalo Creek, but it's dark and the crude
is black,'' Betsy Mallison, a spokeswoman for the state Department
of Environmental Resources, said early today. ``We're focusing on
making sure areas are diked and boomed to keep most of the product
out of the creek.''
   ``It's so hot and volatile and it's difficult for firemen to get
in there and get a close look,'' she said.
   Buffalo Creek flows into the Allegheny River 10 to 15 miles
downstream. Communities along the Allegheny were told they might
have to close their drinking water intake valves.
   Dead fish were starting to rise to the surface in a two-mile
stretch of Buffalo Creek, said Emil Svetahor, spokesman for the
state Fish Commission.
   Three firefighters suffered chemical burns, but their injuries
were not serious, said Ms. Mallison. A mobile home was damaged.
   ``There was an instant when that one fireball went up that I
thought it was coming right on us because you could feel the
heat,'' said one evacuee, Rose Davis, 46, who lives in a trailer
park near West Franklin Township. ``It lit our yard up like
daylight. You could hear the roaring of the fire.''
   The cause of the derailment was under investigation. The two
train operators, who weren't injured, were undergoing drug and
alcohol tests under the Punxsatawney-based company's policy, Bell
said.
   The train derailed as Earth Day festivities wound down 45 miles
away at Pittsburgh's Point State Park, where an estimated 40,000
celebrated the environmental awareness day.
   Tens of thousands of people along the Allegheny were left
without water earlier this month after a pipeline broke and spilled
75,000 gallons of mixed fuel.

   Sudan's military government said today
that loyalist forces had crushed a revolt by junior army officers,
the second reported attempt in a month to overthrow the ruling
junta.
   Sudan's military leader, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir, said
his troops arrested the rebels and were in control of this East
African nation. He did not mention any casualty figures or the
number of arrests.
   ``All those involved in the attempt have been arrested, those
who are in active (military) service and those who are retired,''
el-Bashir said in a speech broadcast at midday over Radio Omduran,
the official government station.
   El-Bashir said the coup plotters had been under surveillance
from the start of the takeover attempt.
   Without elaborating, el-Bashir said the abortive coup was
masterminded by ``the alliance in coalition with the outlaws.''
   The government has often used the term ``outlaws'' to refer to
the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, which has been waging a
seven-year insurgency seeking autonomy for the country's southern
region.
   ``The alliance'' was possibly a reference to political parties
disbanded by el-Bashir after he took control of the country June 30.
   An official government spokesman said today's coup attempt was a
continuation of a bid uncovered in March to topple the military
government.
   Authorities ``took measures to prevent the move from the start''
after receiving information that rebel officers were planning
today's coup attempt, said government spokesman Mohammed Khogali
Salihein.
   He said today's attempted coup was plotted by two retired
officers, Maj. Gen. Abdul-Kadir al-Kadaru and Brig. Gen. Mohammed
Osman Hamid Karrar. He said both officers were in custody, but no
civilians had been arrested.
   Informed sources in the capital of Khartoum said the army
appeared to have had little trouble putting down a series of
attacks led by junior army officers.
   The Sudanese sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the attempted coup began at midnight and the rebels tried to take
over Khartoum airport and official government radio but were
quickly overpowered.
   The sources said several officers tried to shoot their way into
the armed forces general command in Khartoum, apparently in search
of el-Bashir, but could not get through the front gate.
   They said a guard at the general command was wounded in the hand.
   Khartoum airport was closed briefly and telecommunications cut
for several hours. But by midmorning, Khartoum was peaceful.
   ``It was an attempted coup around midnight by a small number of
very low-level officers,'' said a source who said he details came
from people at the general command.
   ``They tried to take over the airport and the radio in a rather
pathetic way and were very unsuccessful,'' the source said.
   Tanks were seen on vital bridges and around the general command.
The army was on full alert, but overall security did not seem
heightened in the streets of the capital.
   In a dispatch from Khartoum, Egypt's state-run Middle East News
Agency said the coup attempt involved junior officers but was
masterminded by some retired officers. It did not identify them.
   In late March, the official Sudan News Agency reported that a
number of civilians and military officers were arrested for
allegedly planning a coup.
   Later, el-Bashir was quoted as saying that only 20 people were
involved and that investigations were under way.
   The junta seized power June 30 by overthrowing Prime Minister
Sadek el-Mahdi's civilian government.
   At the time, el-Bashir said his principal aims were to end the
7-year-old civil war in the south and improve the country's
beleaguered economy. He has had little success.

   Two Palestinian youths died today after being
shot in clashes with troops, and merchants in Arab east Jerusalem
defied strike orders in a growing rebellion against Palestinian
uprising leaders.
   The boys were shot in the head by soldiers dispersing
Palestinian stone-throwers Sunday and died of their wounds early
today, Palestinian reports said.
   An army spokesman confirmed the deaths and said the
circumstances were under investigation.
   Yousef Atta Al Kishawi from the Shati refugee camp in the
occupied Gaza Strip died at Israel's Tel Hashomer Hospital, and
troops clamped a curfew on the area, the army said. Israeli
authorities said he was 13, while Palestinians said he was 10.
   The second fatality was Moussa Mohammed Husseini al Alameh, 14,
from the southern West Bank town of Beit Ummar. Husseini died at
Jerusalem's Mukassed hospital, officials said.
   Today's deaths brought to 676 the number of Palestinians killed
by Israeli soldiers and civilians in the 28-month uprising against
Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   As of March 31, 142 of those killed were children age 16 and
under, according to the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights
in the Occupied Territories.
   Since the start of the uprising, an additional 208 Palestinians
have been killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of cooperating
with Israel. Forty-three Israelis have also died.
   In east Jerusalem, merchants opened their shops today after
Palestinian activists canceled strike calls by the pro-PLO Unified
National Leadership of the Uprising.
   A strike to show Christian-Moslem solidarity was called for
Sunday in the wake of a recent move by Jews to set up a settlement
in the Christian quarter of Jerusalem's Old City. A second day of
strikes was called for today in support of so-called ``liberated''
villages.
   The two-day strike order, contained in the latest Unified
Leadership leaflet, has angered many Moslem Palestinians because it
comes in the middle of the shopping period before the three-day Id
al-Fitr holiday later this week.
   Moslems exchange gifts and prepare festive meals to celebrate Id
al-Fitr which marks the end of the month-long Ramadan fast.

   Seven Israeli airmen were killed when two
U.S.-made transport helicopters collided and burst into flames
during a training flight over the occupied West Bank, the army said
Monday.
   The collision of the two Sikorsky CH-53 helicopters, known as
Sea Stallions, occurred Sunday night in the Baal Hatzor region
north of the West Bank town of Ramallah, the army said.
   Gen. Avihu Bin-Nun, the air force commander, ordered an
investigation.
   Israel radio said the two helicopters collided about 300 yards
from the West Bank's Alon Highway, burst into flames and crashed to
the ground.
   Six airmen were killed immediately, and a seventh died in a
hospital after suffering serious injuries, the radio said. A
government announcment said one of the dead was an air force
lieutenant colonel.

<HEAD>Elephant Undergoing C-Section After Drug Fails To Trigger Labor</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with preparations for surgery under way
after labor-inducing drug fails.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veterinary surgical team began a risky
Caesarean section operation today to help Babe, a 36-year-old Asian
elephant, deliver a calf after her labor stopped five days ago.
   The seven-member team led by Dr. Michael Schmit, a veterinarian
from the Washington Park Zoo in Portland, Ore., began preparations
for the surgery at about 11 a.m. after drugs administered to the
7,700-pound elephant failed to induce labor.
   ``Everybody's kind of nervous. We've got several hours worth of
surgery ahead,'' said Yvonne Pelletreau, a spokeswoman at the
Burnet Park Zoo.
   It will be the third time the veterinary team has attempted a
C-section on an Asian elephant, she said. Only one of the
operations was successful, she said.
   Babe would become the oldest first-time elephant mother to give
birth in a North American zoo.
   Babe began labor Wednesday, but stopped it early Thursday.
Female elephants have the ability to stop their labor when they are
feeling pain and it is not unusual for elephants to take up to five
days to deliver a calf. But zoo officials became concerned about
both mother and infant as the delay continued.
   On Saturday, a group of four veterinarians from Cornell
University checked Babe and found that her cervix was probably too
small for her calf to pass through. They injected her with
Estrabiol to start her cervix dilating, said Pelletreau.
   The drug had some effect, but not enough, so on Sunday the
veterinarians gave Babe a second injection, she said.
   That second injection caused the elephant's cervix to widen
enough for a calf to pass. Early today, the veterinarians gave Babe
ocytocin, a labor-inducing drug, but it didn't work, she said.
   Babe is one of eight Asian elephants currently pregnant in North
American zoos. A second Burnet Park elephant, Romani, is expected
to give birth in July 1991.
   Asian elephants are an endangered species that number fewer than
45,000 in the wild.

   Demonstrators clashed with police
throughout the capital of Katmandu today in the first major
violence since the nation returned to democracy two weeks ago,
witnesses said. Ten people were reported killed and 72 injured.
   In today's clashes, six policemen were beaten to death by
protesters and four demonstrators were fatally shot by police,
witnesses said.
   The violence broke out when a mob of several hundred paraded
three unconscious and bleeding men through the streets. The group
claimed its captives were policemen belonging to a banned
right-wing gang called Mandale, which was once allied with the
monarchy and is now blamed for an outbreak of looting, mugging and
arson.
   Police opened fire in at least four places as the mob with the
three captives marched toward the royal palace. Some men were
beating the three unconscious captives, who were tied together in a
sitting position on a pushcart. Others chanted: ``Birendra, thief,
leave the country!''
   On April 8, King Birendra yielded to a groundswell of
pro-democracy demonstrations and lifted a 29-year ban on political
parties.
   The march was halted by police, who rescued the three
unconscious men accused of belonging to Mandale.
   Two of the captives died and were identified as policemen after
their bodies were brought to Bir Hospital, where the third man was
in serious condition. His identity was not immediately known.
   Four civilians who died of bullet wounds were also brought to
Bir Hospital, doctors said. It was not immediately known whether
they were part of the march on the palace or were shot in other
locations.
   Four policemen were beaten to death by a mob that attacked a
police station in Katmandu's western Teku neighborhood, according
to a reporter who witnessed the killings and spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He said police at Teku initially fired tear gas, then warning
shots in the air and finally gunshots into the crowd. It was not
known if there were any casualties.
   Crowds were seen attacking at least six other police stations.
Demonstrators also set fire to a two-story building housing offices
of the general commissioner, the top civil administrator for the
Katmandu region.
   Doctors at two local hospitals said the injured included 24
people with bullet wounds and 14 others who were suffering from
stab wounds inflicted by the mob. Other people were injured in the
stampede as crowds dispersed.
   Police imposed a curfew in central Katmandu.
   Earlier today, irate residents beat 12 suspected Mandale members
with iron rods and then set fire to four police jeeps, accusing the
police of failing to protect them, the Cabinet's home minister said.
   When the minister, Yog Prasad Upadhyay, and Hem Bahadur Singh,
Nepal's top police official, went to the scene of the beatings,
they were surrounded by hundreds of people, who forced them to
address a public meeting and later pounded their jeep.
   The rage stems from the growing wave of arson, looting and
muggings that followed this Himalayan kingdom's return to democracy.
   Victims and other witnesses say the attacks are the work of the
Mandale. After the group was banned in 1979, they say, it went
underground and served as a vigilante squad supporting Nepal's old
nonpartisan system.
   The pro-democracy movement was launched Feb. 18 by two banned
political groups. The two dominate a government that took office
Thursday.
   The movement snowballed until April 6, when 200,000
demonstrators marched on the royal palace. Police opened fire,
killing up to 200 people, according to witnesses. The king's
government maintained that only 10 people were killed.

   A 3,000-ton vehicle used to haul
space shuttles and other spacecraft around Kennedy Space Center has
logged its 1,000th mile _ after a quarter of a century.
   The crawler transporter's odometer reached the milestone Sunday
while carrying Columbia from the Vehicle Assembly Building 3.4
miles to a launch pad where the shuttle will await a mid-May
liftoff.
   ``She isn't very pretty, and it isn't very fast, not very
streamlined. But it's truly an elegant machine,'' Doug Sargent,
president of Lockheed Space Operations Co., said at a brief
ceremony.
   The 25-year-old transporter moves on four double-tracked trucks
at a pace of 2 mph _ when not loaded. While carrying a shuttle, the
vehicle zips along at less than 1 mph.
   The center has two of the transporters; the other has logged
about 975 miles.

   Six-year-old Elizabeth Gregory wanted
desperately to be a flower girl in someone's wedding, so her
parents placed a classified advertisement saying she was available.
   ``We had about 10 calls from brides and we accepted four of
them,'' said her mother, Anne Gregory.
   The ad also attracted the attention of reporters, and friends of
Anne and her husband, Randy, have told them they heard the story on
national radio and television shows, Mrs. Gregory said.
   The first bride, Sheila Donner, stopped by the Gregorys' home a
week ago to meet with Elizabeth.
   It was love at first sight, Mrs. Gregory said.
   Elizabeth agreed that the pairing was a good one. ``When the
bride came over, she said she wanted our dresses to match,'' she
said. ``I'm going to give a flower to everyone on the ends'' of the
pews.
   Elizabeth said she wasn't nervous about the duties she faces.
   ``I think I have it under control,'' she said.

<HEAD>Afghan Guerrillas Call on Najib to Run for Re-Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghanistan's Moslem guerrillas
Monday called on their archenemy, President Najib, to test his
popularity in an election, but not under the banner of his
Communist-style party.
   The loose, broadly defined proposal for a non-party election
represents a major concession by the seven guerrilla groups
fighting for 12 years to overthrow the Soviet-backed government in
Kabul.
   The proposal came as rockets slammed into the Afghan capital,
hitting a mosque and others sites and killing 19 people and
wounding 11, Radio Kabul said. The report blamed the U.S.-backed
guerrillas for the attack.
   ``We're talking about general elections and that means everybody
can participate,'' said Azim Nasser-Zia, an author of the plan and
a spokesman for the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan, a
moderate guerrilla group.
   But the plan drew a cool response from the Kabul government's
highest-ranking diplomat in Pakistan, Charge d'Affaires Qudrahullah
Ahmadi.
   ``We gave our proposal three years ago for a six-month
cease-fire followed by elections. We are ready for those
elections,'' Ahmadi said. The guerrillas, however, have rejected
the cease-fire.
   ``They'll eventually come over to our proposal,'' he said.
   The guerrillas, who have spent as much time fighting each other
as they have Najib's troops, have come under heavy pressure from
the United States and other financial backers to close ranks and
come up with a political solution to the protracted war.
   Senior U.S. officials in Islamabad said guerrilla leaders have
been warned that their multimillion dollar weapons' pipeline could
dry up next year.
   Washington annually ships between $500 million and $700 million
worth of military supplies to the guerrillas, also known as the
mujahedeen. They are also financed by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and
other sympathetic Arab states. Moscow reportedly pumps billions of
dollars worth of supplies to Kabul.
   Skeptics among the rebels say talk of elections is a stalling
tactic to satisfy the doves while the hawks prepare for one last
fighting season.
   Spring weather is melting the snow on Afghanistan's rugged
mountain passes and allowing rebel fighters to resupply their
positions inside the country.
   The guerrillas control nearly 80 percent of the countryside but
have yet to capture a major city. Najib's forces have failed to
make significant military gains, leading to calls for a political
settlement to the bloody stalement.
   Najib has repeatedly offered to negotiate peace anytime,
anywhere and on any terms with the guerrillas in the last year. The
rebels and their backers rejected the offer, demanding Najib step
down first.
   Washington later said Najib could stay during peace talks but
would eventually have to go before elections, a condition Kabul
rejects.
   While guerrilla leaders appear ready to compromise on Najib's
participation, Nasser-Zia added, ``Under no circumstances could
elections be held under Najib or the People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan.''
   The proposal was drafted by a National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan leader, Pir Sayed Ahmed Gailani. It calls for a United
Nations' team to conduct elections in areas controlled by the
government and for representatives of the Organization of Islamic
Countries to monitor polls in guerrilla-held areas.
   Voters would elect representatives to a traditional Afghan
jirga, or grand assembly, which would choose the person to form a
new government.
   The plan, the latest in a series drafted over the past year, was
outlined at a meeting Sunday with Pakistan President Ghulam Ishaq
Khan and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

   Rival black factions clashed
with guns and knives and attacked homes during the weekend, killing
at least 13 people, including two black police officers,
authorities said Monday.
   Police said 11 people were killed during the weekend in
factional fighting in Natal Province. The dead included a
15-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman, who were shot in separate
incidents, police said.
   Police gave few details on the fighting in other parts of the
nation. Two black police officers were killed in separate incidents
in Cape Province and Natal, police said.
   Police backed up by South African army troops arrested about 70
people in a sweep Sunday through a black township near
Viljoenskroon in Orange Free State, police said. Police declined to
say why the suspects were rounded up.
   The Citizen newspaper reported Monday that police had said they
would not allow extreme right-wing whites to form private militias.
Police officials said such groups were stockpiling weapons and were
a threat to law and order.
   ``We reject the concept of any militant right-wing
organizations, because we cannot allow any member of the public to
take the law into his own hands,'' a police spokesman, Capt. Peet
Bothma, was quoted as saying.
   Extreme right-wing groups that oppose giving blacks political
rights have claimed to be forming armed units. Several air force
members and right-wingers have been arrested on charges of helping
steal air force guns last week for an extremist group.
   On Sunday, African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela
called for intensified armed struggle against the white government
to force speeding up negotiations on the end of apartheid.
   ``There can be no talk of a lasting peace while government
agents continue to massacre people,'' Mandela said, referring to
three recent incidents of police firing on black protesters or
hitting bystanders while shooting at rioters.
   But Mandela told a crowd estimated at 70,000 in Umtata, the
capital of Transkei, the homeland where he was born, that ``only
successful negotiations can convince us to end the armed struggle,
and peace will come as a result of negotiations. It is not
negotiations which will come as a result of peace.''
   President F.W. de Klerk, whose Cabinet will hold talks with a
Mandela-led ANC delegation next week, has said the ANC's continued
calls for armed struggle are an obstacle to formal negotiations on
a new constitution which would give the black majority the vote.
   De Klerk said in an interview broadcast by British television on
Sunday that he was ``strongly opposed to war talk'' and considered
it ``a stumbling block in the way of negotiations.''
   South Africa has been hit by a wave of violence in recent weeks
that has claimed hundreds of lives. Much of the violence involves
power struggles between rival black groups that disagree over plans
for a future South Africa.

   An Oregon woman who does not want to share
parenting rights with the California man who donated his sperm for
her artificial insemination lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that Kevin
McIntyre is entitled to a trial in seeking to prove he donated
sperm only after Linden Crouch said she would let him help raise
the child.
   Ms. Crouch says no such agreement was made.
   Nationwide, more than 20,000 children are born each year through
artificial insemination, the court was told.
   In most cases, women are inseminated with sperm obtained through
a sperm bank from donors who remain anonymous to them. But
McIntyre, from Moraga, Calif., has known Ms. Crouch, from Ashland,
Ore., for over 13 years.
   Ms. Crouch gave birth to a daughter, Glenellen Susan, on Nov.
24, 1986, after being artificially impregnated with sperm she had
asked McIntyre to donate.
   He says Ms. Crouch told him before he agreed to donate his sperm
that she wanted him to share parenting with her. He says she also
agreed to his request for visitation rights.
   In other action today, the high court:
   _ Agreed to use the case if a Mississippi death row inmate to
provide new guidelines for police questioning of suspects.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Robert S. Minnick, a
convicted murderer who said his confession was unlawful because he
was denied his right to have a lawyer present.
   _ Refused to reinstate the California murder conviction of a
Black Panther Party member who was shackled during his 17-month
trial.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
shackling at Johnny Spain's trial violated his rights.
   _ Rejected an appeal by a Utah city accused of unlawfully
promoting religion by subsidizing the Mormon Church and by putting
a church symbol on city property.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, refused to kill a lawsuit
that says the city violated the constitutionally required
separation of church and state.
   _ Refused to give new life to a copyright lawsuit over actress
Shirley MacLaine's 1983 best-selling book, ``Out on a Limb.''
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that MacLaine's
book about reincarnation and other spiritual subjects did not
infringe the copyright of a 1977 book written by Charles Silva.
   _ Rejected an appeal by a former member of the Church of
Scientology of California who wanted the church declared a phony
religion.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Larry
Wollersheim of Aspen, Colo.
   Still pending before the justices is an appeal by the Church of
Scientology of California aimed at overturning a $2.5 million
``emotional distress'' award won by Wollersheim.
   _ Rejected a chemical company's challenge to federal standards
for clean water.
   The court, without comment, left intact rules that govern more
than 1,000 factories producing organic chemicals, plastics and
synthetic fibers.
   Oregon's artificial insemination law denies any parental rights
to sperm donors who are not the woman's husband.
   The law states, ``Such donor shall have no right, obligation or
interest with respect to a child born as a result of the artificial
insemination.''
   Invoking that law, a state trial judge threw out McIntyre's
lawsuit seeking parental rights.
   But a state appeals court, by a 2-1 vote, reinstated his suit in
1988. The appeals court said the state law, when applied to
McIntyre, violated his constitutionally protected due-process
rights.
   The appeals court said McIntyre is entitled to a trial in
Jackson County, Ore., on his allegation that Ms. Crouch broke an
oral agreement.
   The Oregon Supreme Court refused to hear Ms. Crouch's ensuing
appeal last Nov. 30, but postponed any trial until Ms. Crouch could
appeal to the nation's highest court.
   In the appeal acted on today, Ms. Crouch's lawyer argued, ``Mr.
McIntyre's claim, at the most and if proven, is that he has lost a
quantity of sperm because he was tricked by Ms. Crouch.''
   ``This was conduct between private parties,'' the appeal said.
``The government was not involved (so) a liberty interest under the
(Constitution's) due process clause does not exist.''
   Ms. Crouch's appeal said the appeals court ruling ``calls into
question the legal relationships among donors, fathers and children
conceived by artificial insemination in Oregon.''
   Her appeal said most states have artificial insemination laws.
   McIntyre's lawyer urged the justices to reject Ms. Crouch's
appeal. He said McIntyre had tried since 1980 to adopt a child, and
since 1983 had sought to have a child through a surrogate mother.
   The case is Crouch vs. McIntyre, 89-1424.

   Mobs beat six policemen to death, and
security forces shot and killed five civilians during daylong riots
Monday that threatened the Himalayan kingdom's transition to
democracy.
   The mobs accused police of condoning and sometimes joining an
underground monarchist group blamed for a wave of crime that
swelled up last week after a new government headed by pro-democracy
leaders took office.
   Armed policemen in riot gear patrolled Katmandu and its suburbs
after the state-run radio announced a 10-hour curfew beginning at 8
p.m.
   Doctors said 78 people were injured in the violence, the worst
since security forces opened fire April 6 on pro-democracy
demonstrators.
   Witnesses said as many as 200 people were killed that day, but
King Birendra's government said only 10 people died. The killings
and the burgeoning movement for democracy forced Birendra to
abolish his 29-year-old system of government in which political
parties were banned.
   A new coalition government, dominated by once-outlawed political
parties, took office on Thursday. Within 24 hours, there was an
outbreak of arson, mugging and looting.
   Residents blamed the trouble on the Mandale, an outlawed
organization composed of supporters of the old political system and
the monarchy. The Mandale, whose name means ``group'' in the Nepali
language, went underground in 1979 when Birendra officially banned
it because of its violent tendencies.
   In several neighborhoods, residents set up local vigilante
groups on Sunday after receiving anonymous telephone threats that
Mandale members would raid their houses. There appeared to be no
political pattern to the people targeted.
   Monday's trouble started in the morning after residents captured
three men dressed in police uniforms and accused them of belonging
to the Mandale.
   The men were beaten and paraded on a pushcart through Katmandu
and around the walls of Birendra's palace.
   The three unconscious men, their bleeding heads lolling and
faces puffed from beatings, were tied together in a sitting
position as the crowd continued to beat them and chant: ``Birendra,
thief, leave the country.''
   More than six hours after the three were captured, police broke
up the procession and rescued the trio. Two of the men were dead on
arrival at Bir Hospital, and the third was in critical condition.
Doctors who spoke on condition of anonymity said all three were
policemen.
   Later, groups of men and boys attacked police stations in at
least eight other neighborhoods. Four more policemen were beaten to
death, according to an Indian reporter who asked not to be
identified.
   Police fired tear gas and rifles in several places throughout
the capital in an effort to disperse the crowds.
   In Bir Hospital, where most of the casualties were taken, five
civilians had fatal bullet injuries, doctors said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   They said 24 other people were hospitalized for treatment of
bullet wounds at Bir Hospital and Teaching Hospital, Katmandu's
largest medical institutions.
   Fourteen other people were hospitalized with knife wounds. The
doctors said they were stabbed by mobs who accused them of
belonging to the Mandale.
   Most of the other casualties were beaten or were injured in
stampedes.
   ``This is threateneding the new-found democracy,'' said
Rishikesh Shaha, a former foreign minister and now a prominent
human rights activist. ``These are not just teething troubles of
democracy but more serious problems.'' He also accused the Mandale
of instigating the violence.
   The chief government spokesman, Radheshyam Bista, said Prime
Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai met King Birendra for more than
one hour Monday night.
   Bhattarai, a top leader of the Nepali Congress party and the
pro-democracy movement, later met with Home Minister Yog Prasad
Upadhyay and inspector general of police Hem Bahadur Singh to
review the situation. Bhattarai and others have said Nepal may be
headed for a constitutional monarchy.

<TEXT>
   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ Two doctors were fined and given
suspended prison sentences Monday for performing a sex-change
operation on a patient who committed suicide in 1988, eight years
after the surgery.
   An appeals court convicted the doctors of willful aggravated
assault on Jean-Eric Oyac, who had requested the operation because
he wanted to become a woman. French law forbids sex-change
operations unless stringent conditions are met regarding the
psychological need for the surgery.
   During a hearing before the appeals court last year, a
government lawyer, Pierre Berard, said the doctors should be
punished because there was no medical proof beforehand that the
operation was necessary.
   Dr. Jean Vacant, the chief surgeon for the operation, and Dr.
Jean-Claude Masson, who assisted him, were each fined $3,400.
Vacant received a six-month suspended sentence and Masson a
four-month suspended senetnce.
   Dr. Jean Just, a psychiatrist consulted by the other doctors
prior to the operation, was fined $1,360.
   Prior to the operation in March 1980, Oyac worked as a nurse at
a psychiatric hospital in Nice and called himself Jennifer.
   He filed a complaint in 1984 asserting that the operation had
not been successful and that he was in constant pain. In May 1988,
he committed suicide.

   Israeli officials on Monday welcomed the
release of a U.S. hostage in Lebanon but gave no indication that
Israel would comply with Iranian demands that Israel free a
kidnapped Lebanese Shiite clergyman.
   Sources close to the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army said
militia chief Antoine Lahad would decide on Tuesday whether to free
some of his 300 prisoners for Id Al Fitr, the Moslem holiday
marking the end of the Ramadan fast.
   Pro-Iranian radicals holding 17 Western hostages and three
Israeli soldiers in Lebanon could interpret the release of the
mostly Shiite Moslem inmates from the Al Khiam prison just north of
Israel's border as a goodwill gesture.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was
a tradition of freeing prisoners during the holiday. But they said
any release would be up to Lahad and unconnected with the issue of
Western hostages.
   Earlier in the day, Israel radio quoted the South Lebanon Army
as saying it had no intention of freeing Shiite prisoners in
response to the release of the American hostage.
   Iran called for goodwill gestures and a reciprocal move after
U.S. hostage Robert Polhill, 55, an educator held for 1,182 days,
was set free Sunday.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran demanded the release
of Shiite Moslem cleric Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, who was abducted
by Israeli troops in Lebanon in July.
   The Tehran Times, an English-language daily close to President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, noted Israel's detention of scores of Arab
prisoners impeded efforts to free Western hostages. Israeli army
spokesmen and other officials gave no indication that Israel
planned to free Obeid.
   Avi Pazner, spokesman for caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, welcomed the freeing of the American hostage and said
Israel was making efforts to free its own soldiers held captive in
Lebanon.
   ``We are very pleased to hear about the release of this
(American) hostage and would like to see the day when all hostages,
Americans, others and especially Israelis, are also released. We
pray that that day will come soon,'' Pazner said in an interview.
   He acknowledged that Israel and the United States discussed the
hostage issue but said: ``There was no coordination on the release
of this hostage.''
   Israel has offered to trade Obeid for all foreign hostages,
including an Israeli air force navigator and two soldiers who were
captured by Shiite guerrillas in Lebanon in 1986.
   An Israeli army spokesman declined to say if Israel would
release any of the nearly 9,000 Palestinians jailed in connection
with the 28-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   In the days before Polhill's release, Israel carried out two
attacks in Lebanon that were seen by some observers as increased
pressure on pro-Iranian groups holding hostages.

<HEAD>Court Keeps Artificial Insemination Suit Alive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday kept alive a
lawsuit in which a California man seeks parental rights to a child
he fathered by artificial insemination.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by the mother,
Linden Crouch of Oregon, who says she never agreed to share
parental rights with sperm donor Kevin McIntyre.
   The justices refused to block a trial in which McIntyre hopes to
prove he donated sperm only after Ms. Crouch said she would let him
help raise the child.
   Ms. Crouch's appeal said McIntyre has no constitutional right to
share in rearing the child, now 3. ``Mr. McIntyre's claim, at the
most and if proven, is that he has lost a quantity of sperm because
he was tricked by Ms. Crouch,'' the appeal said.
   In other action, the high court:
   _Refused to give new life to a copyright lawsuit over actress
Shirley MacLaine's 1983 best-selling book, ``Out on a Limb.'' The
court let stand rulings that MacLaine's book on reincarnation did
not infringe the copyright of a 1977 book written by Charles Silva.
   _Raised the possibility an Amish sect in Minnesota may be forced
to display a ``slow-moving vehicle'' warning on the back of its
horse-drawn buggies. The justices ordered the Minnesota Supreme
Court to restudy its ruling exempting the Amish from the traffic
warning emblems.
   _Refused to reinstate the California murder conviction of Black
Panther Johnny Spain, who was shackled during his 17-month trial. A
lower court overturned the conviction on the ground the shackling
violated his rights.
   _Agreed to use the case of a Mississippi death row inmate to
provide new guidelines for police questioning of suspects. The
convicted murderer said his confession should not have been
admitted as evidence because he was denied his right to have a
lawyer present.
   _Rejected an appeal by a former member of the Church of
Scientology of California who wanted the church declared a phony
religion. Still pending before the justices is the church's appeal
to overturn a $2.5 million ``emotional distress'' award won by the
former member.
   _Rejected a chemical company's challenge to federal standards
for clean water. The court left intact rules that govern more than
1,000 factories producing organic chemicals, plastics and synthetic
fibers.
   The justices were told in the sperm donor case that more than
20,000 children are born each year through artificial insemination.
   In most cases, sperm banks are used and the donors and the women
are unknown to each other.
   But McIntyre, from Moraga, Calif., has known Ms. Crouch, from
Ashland, Ore., for 13 years.
   Ms. Crouch gave birth to a daughter, Glenellen Susan, on Nov.
24, 1986, after being artificially impregnated with sperm she had
asked McIntyre to donate.
   He said he agreed to the arrangement only after Ms. Crouch told
him she wanted him to share parenting with her and would let him
have visitation rights.
   Oregon's artificial insemination law denies any parental rights
to a sperm donor unless he is married to the recipient.
   A state trial judge threw out McIntyre's lawsuit seeking
parental rights.
   But a state appeals court, by a 2-1 vote, reinstated his suit in
1988. The appeals court said the state law violated McIntyre's
constitutionally protected due-process rights.
   The appeals court said McIntyre is entitled to a trial in
Jackson County, Ore., on his allegation that Ms. Crouch broke an
oral agreement.
   ``This was conduct between private parties,'' Ms. Crouch's
appeal to the Supreme Court said. ``The government was not involved
(so) a liberty interest under the (Constitution's) due process
clause does not exist.''
   Ms. Crouch's appeal said the appeals court ruling ``calls into
question the legal relationships among donors, fathers and children
conceived by artificial insemination in Oregon.''
   Most states have artificial insemination laws, her appeal said.
   McIntyre, in urging the justices to reject Ms. Crouch's appeal,
said he has tried since 1980 to adopt a child and since 1983 has
sought to have a child through a surrogate mother.

   Paulette Goddard, the wide-eyed, waiflike actress
who co-starred with husband Charlie Chaplin in films such as ``The
Great Dictator'' and ``Modern Times,'' died Monday at her home in
southern Switzerland.
   A municipal employee in the village of Ronco said official
records show the actress was born on June 3, 1905, making her 84.
However, reference books give her year of birth as 1915 or 1911.
   The employee, Pia DellaMora, said the exact cause of death was
not known ``but one could assume she died of old age.'' A member of
her household said the actress had a brief illness.
   Ms. Goddard, born Marion Levy in Whitestone, N.Y., began her
career on stage in New York. Her Hollywood debut came with a small
part in ``The Girl Habit'' in 1931, the first of more than 40
movies. She starred alongside Chaplin in ``Modern Times'' in 1936
and ``The Great Dictator'' in 1940.
   Their marriage, her second, ended in divorce in 1942.
   Other films in which the actress had leading roles included
``Dramatic School,'' ``Nothing but the Truth,'' ``I Love a
Soldier,'' ``The Diary of a Chambermaid,'' ``Woman of Vengeance''
and a 1947 British production, ``An Ideal Husband.'' Her last TV
film was ``The Snoop Sisters.''
   Her third marriage, to American actor Burgess Meredith, broke up
in 1944.
   In 1958, she married Erich Maria Remarque, the German-born
American novelist. He became famous in the 1920s for his anti-war
``All Quiet on the Western Front,'' which was banned in Nazi
Germany.
   They settled in Ronco, a picturesque hillside village close to
the Italian frontier and overlooking Lago Maggiore. Remarque died
in 1970.
   Ms. DellaMora said Ms. Goddard was to be cremated with funeral
ceremonies planned for Thursday.

<TEXT>
   It's after dark and car service driver Ronnie
Ramchand is answering a call in the Bronx. The address is on a dark
street and the caller turns out to be a teen-ager carrying a
baseball bat.
   ``Should I, or shouldn't I,'' Ramchand wonders, scrutinizing the
young man.
   If he guesses wrong, it could be deadly.
   A Bronx cab driver found Sunday with a bullet in the back of his
head was the sixth hired driver to die in that borough in six
weeks. Another was found dead Saturday in Brooklyn. Police believe
robbery was the motive.
   This time, Ramchand guesses right. He gave the teen-ager a ride
and lived to tell about it.
   ``I'm taking precautions,'' he says. ``I'm not picking up
anybody I don't like the looks of.''
   Mayor David Dinkins has ordered undercover police officers to
drive cabs in hope of catching the killer or killers. Soon, they
may become the only night-time cab drivers in the Bronx _ scores
have quit driving after dark.
   ``Why should I?'' asked Carlos Rosado, a driver for Parkway Car
Service. ``It's crazy. I'm only 20. I'm not going to lose my life.
No way.''
   But that's why Ramchand, who had been driving for a living for
two months, works nights. So many night drivers have quit that
Ramchand, who normally works days, is driving well into the night
to help Express Taxi Service with its driver shortage.
   Three of the shootings have been linked through ballistic tests
to the same .22-caliber gun. Those three victims had been called to
pick up passengers late at night at addresses within a mile of each
other in the Bronx.
   Ramchand admits there's little he can do to protect himself.
Unlike many other drivers, he doesn't even carry a crowbar as a
weapon.
   ``Passengers sit right behind you,'' Ramchand said. ``You can't
see them. You're not going to know if they're going to hit you.''
   Conventional ``medallion'' cabs, which are allowed to pick up
passengers who hail them on the street, often have bullet-resistant
partitions between the driver and passengers.
   But the vehicles used by car services often are ramshackle and
have no such partitions. The city's car services respond to
telephone calls and may not pick up passengers who hail them on the
street.
   In New York's outer boroughs, medallion cabs are hard to find.
They make more money picking up fares in busy Manhattan.
   Some of the upscale chauffeur services accept vouchers, reducing
the amount of cash a driver carries. But some, like Ramchand's,
take only cash, making them moving targets for robbers.
   He says he will not pick up a fare that ``doesn't feel right.''
   That teen-ager with the baseball bat called from a section of
street where the lights were not working. Ramchand went to the
address and blew his horn, and the young man walked toward him.
Ramchand looked carefully. He noticed the bat was accompanied by a
glove, and the sweat and dirt on the youth's baseball clothes.
   ``As long as I'm careful, I'll be OK. I'm not scared but my wife
is,'' Ramchand said.
   Elsewhere in the Bronx, driver William Barnwell was less
sanguine. One of his cousins was among the slain drivers.
   ``What can I say? I'm scared to death,'' Barnwell said.
   ``I've been robbed. I've been beaten up. I've had my (tooth)
caps knocked out. I got 14 stitches in my head last year. And now
this guy not only wants your money, he wants to kill you,'' he said.
   Barnwell, who works days, says he has been robbed so often that
other drivers tease him.
   ``That last guy, he didn't even say `stick 'em up,''' Barnwell
recalled. ``Man, I've never seen so many guns pointed at me since I
took this job.''
   The attacks have taught him what kind of fare to avoid. ``The
tipoff is when somebody late at night wants to go only a short
distance. Don't pick those calls up,'' he said.

   The pilot of a single-engine plane that was
having engine problems landed the craft on Interstate 64 near
Richmond International Airport, police said.
   No one was injured Sunday night when Ryland W. Fleet landed the
1976 Grumman American two-seater on the westbound lanes, said state
police Sgt. E.L. Maxie.
   ``He really handled this well,'' Maxie said.
   Fleet, 34, of Richmond, was a few miles from the airport, his
destination, when the engine trouble began, Maxie said.
   ``We were just very fortunate that with it being a Sunday night,
traffic was what we considered to be very light,'' Maxie said.
   Neither Fleet nor his passenger, identified only as Michelle
Trollope, asked for medical attention, Maxie said.
   The plane, which took off from Heathsville, was towed two miles
to the airport.

   ``Truly amazing,'' the president said.
   Bush also presented his daily ``point of light'' award to G. Van

drugs.
   ``All of you here are proof of what Americans have always known:

<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James Watkins unleashed a
scathing attack Monday on the Northeast, saying the region's
continued opposition to pipelines, refineries and nuclear plants
likely will cause repeats of last winter's heating oil crisis.
   The Northeast has ``not participated ... in the agony'' in
balancing their desires for a pristine environment with assuring a
secure and adequate supply of energy, Watkins told a House energy
subcommittee.
   A national energy strategy being prepared for President Bush
will emphasize the Northeast's greater reluctance than other
regions to supply its own energy needs, he said.
   ``I don't see anybody clamoring for a reduced standard of
living,'' Watkins told the three members of the Energy panel's
oversight and investigations subcommitee present at the hearing.
   ``But if you don't so some of these things, then you're going to
have to face the consequences.''
   For example, he said, 11 refineries with a combined production
capacity of 2.5 million barrels a day have been rejected over the
past two decades for environmental reasons by state and local
governments in the region.
   ``If some of these refineries had been built, the additional
capacity might have helped to alleviate last winter's supply
problems in the Northeast,'' he said.
   Watkins said the proposed energy strategy to be submitted to
Bush in December will seek to ``level the playing field'' and
present options to eliminate obstacles to moving toward an energy
policy that better balances costs among regions of the country.

<HEAD>Safety Board Fails To Pinpoint Cause Of Cargo Plane Crash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal safety investigators concluded Monday
that an improperly latched cargo door popped open before a cargo
plane crashed in Texas last year, but said they could not determine
the cause of the crash.
   The accident at Carswell Air Force Base near Fort Worth killed
the pilot and co-pilot, who were the only people aboard the DC-9
operated by Evergreen International Airlines.
   The National Transportation Safety Board, after a meeting on the
March 18, 1989, crash, said inadequate procedures used by Evergreen
for preflight verification of cargo door security contributed to
the crash.
   The board also blamed the Federal Aviation Administration for
approving procedures used for verification of cargo door security
and for failing to order modifications to the open door warning
system on DC-9s used as cargo planes.
   McDonnell Douglas was cited for failing to provide the flight
crew guidance on in-flight opening of the cargo door, despite 23
previous incidents involving DC-9s and DC-8s. None of the previous
incidents resulted in an accident.
   The board said KLM, which owned the aircraft before Evergreen,
accomplished only three of the 11 items the manufacturer
recommended for the main cargo door and Evergreen took no
additional action on the items.
   All FAA-ordered actions were taken, however, investigators said.
   The board said the flight's co-pilot probably failed to complete
the door locking cycle and the captain was not aware of it because
of the malfunctioning warning system. The door opened upon takeoff,
investigators concluded.
   The opening of a cargo door could disturb the stability of an
airliner, affecting airspeed and altitude, the board said in
recommending that McDonnell Douglas amend its operating manual to
include information about the effects of an open cargo door on
flight.
   The plane crashed during a turn as it was preparing to land.

   Sweaters made of man-made fibers in Hong Kong,
South Korea and Taiwan, representing more than a third of the U.S.
market, are being sold at less than their fair market value, the
Commerce Department said Monday.
   The National Knitwear &amp; Sportswear Association had filed
complaints against the sweater manufacturers last September.
   It said that the imports, made predominatnly of acrylic fiber,
represent 72 percent of the $1.3 billion U.S. market and that the
three countries represent 55 percent of the imports.
   The Commerce Department said the value of the sweaters imported
from Hong Kong in 1989 was $208.8 million; from South Korea, $476.1
million, and from Taiwan, $485.5 million.
   The department's finding was preliminary. A final determination
is due by July 5, it said.
   If it too determines the sweaters are being dumped, the
International Trade Commission will decide within 45 days whether
the imports injure or threaten to injure the U.S. sweater industry.
   If the ITC decision is affirmative, the Commerce Department then
will order the Customs Service to collect antidumping duties to
make the imported sweater prices comparable to those of U.S.-made
sweaters.

   An old basketball buddy of Robert Polhill
said Monday the former hostage is the kind of man who's willing to
bend over backward to help people.
   So folks in the area where Polhill grew up want to do the same
for him when he returns.
   ``We are planning a big celebration,'' said Mayor George Carter,
who played basketball with Polhill in the 1960s.
   Homes and businesses in Fishkill are festooned with yellow
ribbons and lights to honor Polhill and the other hostages.
   When Polhill comes home ``we'll take them down,'' Carter said.
``That'll be to let him know our prayers have been answered.''
   Moslem extremists in Lebanon freed Polhill on Sunday after
holding him more than three years. Polhill, 55, grew up in nearby
Beacon. His mother, Ruth, lives in Fishkill, about 60 miles north
of New York City.
   ``Bob's a very mild individual, a very gentle individual,''
Carter said. ``He's the type of person who will bend over backward
to do things for people. We're trying to do the same for him. He's
one of ours.''
   Fishkill, Beacon and Dutchess County officials will meet
Wednesday to plan festivities for Polhill's homecoming, Carter
said. Officials don't know yet when he'll be released from a
hospital in Wiesbaden, West Germany, where he is recovering from
his ordeal.
   Mrs. Polhill spoke by phone with her son for about 15 minutes
Monday. While he ``sounded good, there was a difference in his
voice I didn't like too much,'' she said. ``He sounded hoarse.''
   Polhill told her he was recovering from bronchitis, she said.
   Doctors told her that while Polhill appeared in good spirits
after his release, hostages ``all are high and happy for a day or
two, then feel tired out,'' she said.
   Polhill's sons, Brian, 23, and Stephen, 26, were preparing to
fly to Germany on Monday evening to be reunited with their father.
The brothers live in the New York City.
   Brian Polhill predicted that the first thing his father would do
on his return is watch a replay of the 1987 Giants-Broncos Super
Bowl. ``He was kidnapped the day before the game,'' he said.
   Johanne Polhill, Robert's first wife and the mother of Brian and
Stephen, shared champagne with her sons Sunday. She also lives in
New York City. Polhill's second wife, Feryal, is Lebanese.
   Ruth Polhill spent most of Sunday and Monday talking with
reporters and celebrating with friends at her home.
   ``She's been up and down on a roller coaster,'' said the Rev.
James Edgar of First Presbyterian Church in Beacon, which Mrs.
Polhill attends. ``I think it's still just registering with her
that he's free.''
   Sirens and church bells sounded throughout the community Sunday
when word was announced that Polhill was free.
   A ribbon has been wrapped around the steeple of First Reformed
Church in Fishkill since the village held a hostage awareness week
in December. A bow was tied onto the ribbon Sunday when the town
learned Polhill was released, said church secretary Eva Bettencourt.
   The church also has a tree decorated with more than 10,000
lights to symbolize the total number of days spent in captivity by
Polhill and the remaining seven American hostages in Lebanon.
   ``That's the only blight to the whole thing, that these other
families, whom I've become well acquainted with by phone, are
unhappy,'' Mrs. Polhill said.
   The relatives of some of the other hostages felt Polhill's
release was a good sign.
   ``I think it's only a matter of time before Alann is free,''
Craig Steen, of Orlando, Fla., said of his brother. Alann Steen was
taken hostage the same time as Polhill, along with Jesse Jonathan
Turner.
   Peggy Say, whose brother Terry Anderson is the longest-held
hostage, also said Polhill's release was ``good news for all the
hostage families.''
   Polhill's appearance on television was encouraging, Ms. Say
said, ``because I need to believe that that is indicative of the
improved conditions of the hostages that we had been told about
over the past year or so.''
   Anderson, 42, Chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
   Federal health officials Monday called
experiments involving animals the linchpin of medical advances and
said animal rights activists threaten to derail this progress.
   ``Animal studies ... have been and continue to be an
indispensable part of the great biomedical revolution that has
brought freedom from disease and suffering to millions of human
beings,'' said Constance Horner, under secretary of health and
human services.
   ``Virtually every major medical advance of the last hundred
years has involved such studies _ the development of vaccines for
polio, tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough; insulin for
diabetics; radiation and chemotherapy for cancer patients; organ
transplants; and antibiotics.''
   In a pep talk to scientists at the National Institutes of Health
in Bethesda, Md., the day before a planned animal-rights rally
there, Horner condemned the activities of ``extremists'' who are
cultivating ``a climate of fear'' throughout the scientific
research community.
   Scientists are being intimidated and threatened and their
experiments sabotaged, she said
   ``We must not permit the activities of a handful of extremists
to deprive millions of life-sustaining and life-enhancing fruits of
biomedical research,'' she said in prepared remarks.
   Horner said scientists, including those at NIH, have long
discouraged and condemned animal research that is unnecessary or
cruel.
   Dr. Frederick Goodwin, head of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and
Mental Health Administration, told reporters earlier that both NIH
and his agency conduct research under the regulations of the Animal
Welfare Act of 1966.
   ``In many cases, it's easier to do research with humans than
with animals,'' he said.
   Animal rights activists planned a demonstration at NIH on
Tuesday to protest the use of animals in addiction research.
   Friends of Animals, which is sponsoring the protest, says too
much is being spent on animal experimentation at the expense of
treatment and prevention of drug addiction.
   The group contends scientists' search for a cure for addiction
is fruitless and fails to address the underlying social and
psychological causes of addiction.
   Goodwin said the federal government is spending about $1 million
this year and hopes to increase that to $20 million next year on
various efforts to educate the public, especially the young, about
the life sciences.
   He said that was necessary, in part, to counter the efforts of
animal rights activists, who he said use Americans' lack of science
knowledge to ``confuse the public.''
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals characterized the
effort as ``indoctrinating children with the idea that animals are
no more than test tubes with whiskers.''

<HEAD>Marilyn Quayle Presses Need for Mammograms with Congress</HEAD>

Tucker's death from 1974 to 1975.</NOTE>

   A teary Marilyn Quayle told a congressional
panel Monday that her mother might have been spared a painful death
from breast cancer had the disease been detected at an early stage.
   Mrs. Quayle, making her first appearance on Capitol Hill since
her husband, Dan Quayle, became vice president in January 1989,
recounted her mother's death at age 56. Her voice cracked with
emotion.
   ``We meet this morning to declare war on breast cancer. ... A
war in which there can be no substitute for victory,'' Mrs. Quayle
said before the House subcommittee on health and environment.
   The 40-year-old Mrs. Quayle, who has traveled the country urging
women over age 35 to have mammograms, recalled what happened when
her mother, a pediatrician in Indiana, found a lump in her breast.
   ``Her own physician told her not to worry. He had seen many
lumps in the past; he was fairly certain this one was benign,''
Mrs. Quayle said of her mother, the late Mary Tucker.
   Within six months, however, the lump had grown and the cancer
had spread to Mrs. Tucker's lymphatic system. After debilitating
breast surgery and painful chemotherapy, Mrs. Tucker died in 1975.
   ``Mary Tucker's story does not have to be repeated,'' Mrs.
Quayle said. ``Mammography and self-examination could have kept her
alive. Early detection could have given my mother less severe
surgical options. It could have slowed the spread of the disease.''
   While Mrs. Quayle has promoted the need for mammograms, she did
not endorse legislation that would finance screening for low-income
women for breast and cervical cancer.
   The legislation, sponsored by Reps. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., the
panel's chairman, and Edward Madigan, R-Ill., is expected, if
passed, to cost $50 million in fiscal year 1991.
   Madigan asked Mrs. Quayle if she could persuade the Bush
administration to back the measure. Instead, she dwelt on the fear
that keeps some women for having the X-rays.
   ``Fear is what we are fighting,'' she said. ``Fear, the greatest
obstacle to early detection and treatment _ fear of the unknown,
fear of what might turn up on the X-ray.''
   She also said that ``women don't take care of themselves'' and
urged men to be more aggressive in encouraging the women in their
lives to have breast cancer examinations.
   Noting that women frequently are the ones who hound husbands and
children on health care, she said, ``It's time for the men in our
lives to hound us.''
   Also testifying was Rep. Barbara Vucanovich, R-Nev., who said no
doctor ever mentioned to her the need for a mammogram until she was
61. Her first examination detected a tumor.
   ``Early detection of my breast cancer allowed me to go on to
live an active and satisfying life, and caused me to dedicate
myself to reducing breast cancer,'' she said.

   Seven stowaways from Ecuador are
described as lucky to be alive after surviving nine days without
food or water inside the cargo hold of a freighter.
   Federal officials boarded the Ecuadoran freighter Santa Rita on
Sunday in New Haven Harbor to check out the seven men, who were not
allowed to leave the ship. Reporters were not allowed on the ship
to talk to crew members.
   The ship's crew discovered the starving, dehydrated men Friday,
shortly after the vessel left Philadelphia for New Haven, officials
said.
   ``They wanted to be in the U.S. _ you know, the land of honey,''
U.S. Customs Inspector Vincent Caggiula said Sunday. ``They had
food and water for maybe part of the first day. They had a common
sleeping place. They're lucky to be alive.''
   He said their conditions quickly improved Saturday after gorging
themselves on food and drink.
   The Santa Rita arrived in New Haven late Saturday.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Joseph Coughlin said the stowaways did
not need hospitalization and remained on the ship in makeshift
cells in the crew quarters.
   The ship was scheduled to return to Ecuador with stops in New
York, Florida, Texas and Mexico, said Customs official Robert
Curely, director of the port in New Haven.

<HEAD>Reform Communist Elected Slovene President, Center-Right Leads in
Croatia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A center-right coalition claimed
victory Monday in multiparty parliamentary elections in Croatia,
while a reform Communist won the run-off presidential election in
neighboring Slovenia.
   The elections in the two republics were considered crucial for
the future of Yugoslavia, a loose federation of six republics and
two provinces. There were fears the voting could further divide the
country.
   Slovenia and Croatia have taken the lead in holding the first
free multiparty elections in Yugoslavia in almost 50 years. Nearly
4 million voters went to the polls in the two northern republics on
Sunday.
   But Serbia, the largest republic and only one of two still led
by hard-line Communists, has accused some Slovene and Croatian
leaders of advocating secession from the Balkan nation of 23
million.
   In Slovenia, with nearly all the 1.2 million ballots counted,
Communist reformer Milan Kucan had 58.39 of the vote after Sunday's
second-round presidential balloting.
   Joze Pucnik, leader of the center-right DEMOS coalition, trailed
with 41.6 percent of the vote, and conceded the election.
   Kucan formerly headed the Slovene Communist Party, renamed the
Party of Democratic Reform, which has insisted that Slovenia remain
part of a reconstructed Yugoslav federation. Pucnik advocated
Slovenia's secession from Yugoslavia.
   Kucan thus becomes Eastern Europe's first freely elected
Communist head of state since a democratic upheaval swept the
region last year.
   ``We should now heal the rifts of a very divisive campaign by
uniting for the sake'' of Slovenia, Kucan said in a television
interview Monday.
   Kucan, 49, said he had turned in his party membership card for
the duration of his four-year term of office in a goodwill gesture
toward his opponents.
   ``I want to be the president of all ... citizens of Slovenia,''
Kucan said.
   Despite Kucan's victory, his party was soundly defeated in the
April 8 parliamentary elections.
   He will have to work with a government chosen by Pucnik's DEMOS
coalition, which is expected to form the first non-Communist
government in any of Yugoslavia's republics in 45 years. The
center-right coalition won 55 percent of the seats in Slovenia's
regional parliament.
   In Croatia, the second largest republic, a leader of the
Croatian Democratic Union, a center-right coalition, claimed
victory in the republic's parliamentary elections.
   Neven Jurica, a coalition leader, said the Union had won an
``impressive victory'' and was expected to take an outright
majority of seats in the election's first-round.
   Jurica said the coalition's first task would be to change
Croatia's Communist constitution into a Western-style charter.
   Voters chose among 30 parties to fill 356 seats in the
three-chamber parliament.
   With nearly one-third of the votes in 106 constituencies
counted, the Union's candidates were leading in 60 of them, the
reform Communist Party in 38, and the centrist Coalition of
National Accord in eight, according to preliminary figures released
by the state electoral commission.
   About 80 percent of Croatia's 3.5 million eligible voters cast
their ballots in Sunday's first-round elections for the 116-seat
Chamber of Counties and the 80-seat Socio-Political Chamber.
   Election officials said they would not release any more
preliminary results until voting was completed Monday among factory
workers for the remaining 160 seats in the Labor Chamber of the
legislature. Preliminary results from that voting were not expected
before Tuesday.
   A second round of voting will be held in two weeks in
constituencies where no candidate won a majority.
   The Union advocates a system in which all six republics would
have ``full sovereign rights,'' according to the party's leader
Franjo Tudjman, a former Yugoslav army general who spent a total of
five years in jail for what were termed ``counterrevolutionary
activities.''
   Yugoslavia's last multiparty elections were held in 1939.
Opposition groups claim that a ballot in 1945 was rigged by the
Communist Party, which thereafter banned all dissent and turned the
country into a single-party state.

   An Amtrak passenger train carrying about
400 people derailed Monday east of Batavia, injuring scores of
people, authorities said.
   Ambulances and rescue helicopters headed to the scene. Ottumwa
Regional Health Center was told to expected 70 to 80 patients
stemming from the derailment, said Janice Simpson, a hospital
spokeswoman.
   ``We hear about 20 fairly seriously injured,'' Ms. Simpson said.
   The eastbound California Zephyr derailed about 1:25 p.m. It was
carrying 394 passengers and about 20 crew members, said Debbie
Hare, the Amtrak spokeswoman in Chicago.
   The train had 12 passenger cars and three locomotives, Hare said.
   Among the injured passengers was Wisconsin State Rep. Marlin
Schneider, who was suffered a bruise to his leg.
   ``We were having lunch and suddenly the train came apart,'' said
Schneider, who was traveling with his two young daughters. ``It
started to buckle. We didn't get hurt very badly but a number of
people did.''
   Sections of the California Zephyr originate in Seattle, Los
Angeles and Oakland, Calif., and are linked in Salt Lake City for
the trip to Chicago, Hare said.
   Batavia is about 90 miles southeast of Des Moines.

<HEAD>^Bush's Deal: Better Iran Relations in Return for Hostages</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ ``No deals'' is the word from George Bush. But one
deal is held out that clearly interests Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani: Release of American hostages would lead to dramatically
improved relations between the United States and Iran.
   The same offer applies to Syria, the other key government with
the ability to influence the hostage situation.
   The release of an American in Lebanon _ this time it was Robert
Polhill _ always sets analysts scrambling to determine if something
has changed, if there is reason to hope that the ordeal of the
remaining hostages might soon end.
   The hope this time is that Iran and Syria might be seeing
release of the hostages as the price they must pay for improved
relations.
   That would be the reverse of Iran's stance last summer, when the
demand was that the United States make the first move.
   ``I have said many times that if the United States expects us to
help in the Lebanese issue, it should show in practice that it has
dropped its hostile stand against us,'' Rafsanjani said then.
   Has there been a significant change? As usual in the Middle
East, who knows?
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on the Middle East, said the release of Polhill made
it ``appropriate for the United States to send some kind of a
gesture that we're willing to enter into a dialogue with Iran.''
   ``There are a lot of things that could be done here _ short of
aid, short of normalization, short of credits _ that might be a
gesture in response to the release of a hostage,'' he said on CBS'
``Face the Nation.''
   But the response from the White House was to maintain a tough
line.
   ``As the president said yesterday, we want the release of all
hostages. That would open the door towards better relations with
Iran,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Bush had to admit on Sunday that he couldn't say what Iran's
role had been in gaining Polhill's release.
   ``I can't tell you I honestly know,'' said the president.
   American analysts cite Iran and Syria as the two countries with
obvious influence on the groups that are holding 17 Westerners,
including seven Americans, in Lebanon.
   But can a one quick command from Tehran or Damascus bring
freedom for the hostages?
   That doesn't seem likely.
   Richard Murphy, assistant secretary of state for the Near East
during the Reagan administration, pointed out on NBC's ``Meet the
Press'' that there are no clear lines of authority within
Hezbollah, the organization that includes the Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine, which was holding three Americans
including Polhill.
   Gary Sick, a National Security Council aide when Jimmy Carter
was president, appeared on the same program as Murphy. The show
aired before Polhill's release and the two men were speculating
about the reasons for the delay. Word was circulated last week that
one of American hostages would be freed on Friday, but then the
release was abruptly postponed.
   Sick speculated that the delay might be ``simply a demonstration
of a long negotiating process that this is not going to be easy,
and that if the West wants to get their hostages out they're going
to have to provide some concessions to Iran.''

   President Bush sought to unravel a White House
mystery Monday: What bit presidential pooch Millie on the nose?
   Bush, returning from a midday speech, stepped from his
limousine, conferred with National Park Service groundskeepers and
then led them on a search of an ivy-covered hill 50 yards from the
mansion.
   They poked around the knoll for a few minutes before Bush headed
for the Oval Office.
   Reporters, watching from afar, clamored for an explanation.
   The president, assuming an air of mock gravity, responded:
   ``There's a very serious problem. When I get ready to announce
what I was doing, I'll let you know. It was very serious stuff.''
   Then he was ready.
   ``Millie got bit on the nose by some animal,'' he added.
``There's a big hole over there.''
   Millie, an English springer spaniel, had the encounter Friday
and still had scabs on her nose, a press aide to first lady Barbara
Bush said later Monday.
   ``Mrs. Bush is speculating it was something big. Millie had her
nose where it shouldn't have been and she got bit,'' said aide Jean
Becker.
   Millie's nose swelled up after the incident, but the swelling
went down by evening and she required no treatment, Ms. Becker
added.
   Millie went to Camp David later Friday for the weekend with her
mistress.
   It was anybody's guess whether Millie suffered this comeuppance
from a groundhog or some other low-lying lawn beast.
   Bush has boasted of Millie's hunting prowess. The springer
spaniel has recorded almost a dozen known kills of squirrels,
rabbits and at least one rat.

<TEXT>
   An international group of museum directors on
Monday pledged financial support to an art gallery facing obscenity
charges for displaying Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually explicit
photographs.
   Trustees of the Association of Art Museum Directors came to
Cincinnati from across the country and Canada to show their support
for the Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis Barrie.
   The gallery and Barrie were indicted April 7 on misdemeanor
obscenity charges for displaying the seven disputed photos in the
175-picture collection by the late Mapplethorpe. Some of the photos
in the show, which angered Sen. Jesse Helms and prompted debate
about federal funding for the arts, depict naked children or
homosexual acts.
   The New York-based association represents directors of 153
museums in the United States and Canada.
   John Walsh, the association's president and director of the J.
Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, said the charges are an attack on
constitutionally protected freedom of expression.
   ``If a prosecutor here can use indictments, police actions and
confiscation to intimidate an art exhibit, then other prosecutors
may be tempted,'' Walsh told a news conference at the gallery. ``We
see something sinister here. ... If Dennis is under indictment, we
think we're all under indictment.''
   None of the photos was confiscated, but patrons were cleared
from the Cincinnati show for a time on its opening day while
authorities videotaped the exhibit.
   The museum association criticized Cincinnati prosecutors and
those those who supported them.
   ``This is the tip of the iceberg,'' said Marc Wilson, the
association's second vice president and director of the
Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo. ``The question is,
is one group _ with the set of values of this group _ allowed to
define what the majority should see? ... It's not just about art.
It's about your right to do a lot of things.''
   The association said it would pay any fine that Barrie, the art
gallery and its trustees might incur. It also promised to help
defray defense costs and to provide witnesses and testimony if
there is a trial.
   Hamilton County Municipal Judge David Albanese has scheduled a
pretrial meeting with the lawyers April 30. Barrie and lawyers for
the center have pleaded innocent.
   Barrie said the art center's legal costs are ``in the tens of
thousands of dollars.''
   Karl Kadon, an assistant city prosecutor overseeing the
prosecution, declined comment Monday.
   The exhibit has attracted more than 35,000 people since it
opened April 7, spokeswoman Amy Banister said.
   The 50-year-old arts center's previous record attendance for any
exhibit was 29,000 for the six-week ``Computers and Art'' show in
late 1987.
   The Mapplethorpe show, titled ``The Perfect Moment,'' continues
to be shown in its entirety at the art gallery. The center obtained
an April 8 order from U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin protecting the
exhibit against confiscation.

   Paulette Goddard, the wide-eyed, waiflike actress
who co-starred with husband Charlie Chaplin in films such as ``The
Great Dictator'' and ``Modern Times,'' died Monday at her home in
southern Switzerland.
   A municipal employee in the village of Ronco said official
records show the actress was born June 3, 1905, making her 84.
However, reference books give her year of birth as 1911 or 1915.
   The employee, Pia DellaMora, said the exact cause of death was
not known ``but one could assume she died of old age.'' A member of
her household said the actress had a brief illness.
   Ms. Goddard, born Marion Levy in Whitestone, N.Y., began her
career on stage in the New York show ``Rio Rita.'' Her Hollywood
debut came with a small part in ``The Girl Habit'' in 1931, the
first of 40-plus movies.
   As a member of the Hal Roach Studio stock company, she starred
with Chaplin in two of his classics, ``Modern Times'' in 1936 and
``The Great Dictator'' in 1940.
   Their marriage, her second, ended in divorce in 1942.
   ``She turned out to be a fine actress,'' Bob Hope said Monday
from his Los Angeles home. ``She was everything. She was beautiful.
She was perfect.''
   Hope, who appeared with Ms. Goddard in the movies ``The Cat and
the Canary'' in 1939, ``The Ghost Breakers'' in 1940 and ``Nothing
But the Truth'' in 1941, recalled how he was flattered when his
hero Chaplin told him, ``You've got great timing.''
   ``It was a very big moment in my professional life,'' Hope said.
``When I was a kid I used to do an imitation of him. Now, here I
was, acting with his wife and he paid me a compliment.''
   Other films in which the actress had leading roles included
``Dramatic School,'' ``I Love a Soldier,'' ``The Diary of a
Chambermaid'' and a 1947 British production, ``An Ideal Husband.''
Her last TV film was ``The Snoop Sisters.''
   Her third marriage, to American actor Burgess Meredith, broke up
in 1944.
   In 1958, she married Erich Maria Remarque, the German-born
American novelist. He became famous in the 1920s for his anti-war
``All Quiet on the Western Front,'' which was banned in Nazi
Germany.
   They settled in Ronco, a picturesque hillside village close to
the Italian frontier and overlooking Lago Maggiore. Remarque died
in 1970.
   ``She was such a wonderful girl, a real woman with a lot of
wit,'' said actor Macdonald Carey from his Beverly Hills, Calif.,
home. ``Sometimes actresses are known for only one anecdote or
something, but she was much more down to earth than that.''
   Carey appeared opposite Miss Goddard in the 1948 comedy
``Hazard'' and in the 1949 film ``Bride of Vengeance.''
   Ms. DellaMora said Ms. Goddard was to be cremated with funeral
ceremonies planned for Thursday.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly two-thirds of the record $2.98 billion
that Americans gave to the United Way last year came from
individuals, the service organization said Monday.
   An estimated 80 million Americans, or 43 percent of the adult
population, gave last year, the group said. Individuals contributed
$1.9 billion, or 64 percent, of the United Way's total while
corporations gave about $778 million. The rest came from
foundations, direct mail and major individual gifts.
   The money will be distributed to 40,000 groups around the
country to help fight drug abuse, homelessness, poverty and other
problems, the organization said.
   Last year's level was $200 million, or 7.2 percent, higher than
in 1988. It was the largest dollar increase over a one-year period
in the United Way's history and the highest percentage increase
since 1985.
   In addition to cash contributions, companies gave $53 million
worth of goods and services, double the value of such gifts in
1988. Also, the National Football League donated more than $45
million in television and radio broadcast time for United Way
public service announcements.

<TEXT>
   A veterinary team tried to perform a
Caesarean section on a 36-year-old Asian elephant Monday, but
instead removed a dead 266-pound calf from the mother.
   Officials at the Burnet Park Zoo said they weren't sure why the
calf, a male, died. They said the position of the calf's head had
prevented the mother, known as Babe, from delivering naturally.
   The 7,700-pound Babe was expected to survive the operation by
the special surgical team, zoo officials said.
   It was the third time the team had tried a C-section on an Asian
elephant, and only one of the operations was successful, said zoo
spokeswoman Yvette Pelletreau.
   Babe would have been been the oldest first-time elephant mother
to give birth in a North American zoo. She went into labor
Wednesday night.
   The medical team from Cornell University and zoos around the
country decided to operate after labor-inducing drugs failed to
bring about a natural birth.
   As preparation for possible surgery, Burnet Park on Sunday
gathered some needed material: two king-size mattresses, a one-ton
chain hoist to lift the calf and two five-ton chain hoists to lift
Babe.
   The zoo world followed Babe's pregnancy because of the rarity of
captive births by Asian elephants, an endangered species that
number less than 45,000 in the wild. There have been just 62 births
in captivity and only 14 North American zoos have Asian-elephant
breeding programs.

   A top Contra leader in Nicaragua says
rebel troops he commands will not disarm until the Sandinista army
disappears, regardless of a demobilization accord with the
government-elect.
   ``The causes for our fight will have been fulfilled once the EPS
(Sandinista army) and the Interior Ministry (internal security
forces) disappear,'' Dennis Galeano, known as Commander Johnny,
told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday.
   Representatives of the U.S.-backed rebels signed accords with
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's United National
Opposition on April 19, agreeing to move into rural security zones
and disarm by June 10, 6{ weeks after Mrs. Chamorro takes office on
Wednesday.
   Although Contra negotiators said the agreement was
unconditional, they were clearly aware that the Sandinistas agreed
to depoliticize the army and forbid officers to serve in party
posts. The Sandinista party now controls the army.
   ``What has been signed is in exchange for something that will
happen. If everything goes according to plan, we will disarm.''
said Galeano, the brother of Contra chief-of-staff Israel Galeano,
known as Commander Franklin.
   Dennis Galeano reported had more than 2,000 guerrillas under his
command and said they will move into security zones designed to
keep the Sandinista army and Contras apart, as called for in the
accords.
   But differences of interpretation and suspicion of each other's
intentions after nine years of civil war may cause hangups on
demobilization. The Sandinistas note the government agreed to
``respect the integrity and professionalism'' of the Sandinista
People's Army, interpreting this to mean the military command will
be left intact.
   Contras in the field, however, said the current command
structure could not be retained.
   ``This is the voice of the people; they didn't vote for a
partial change, they voted for a total change,'' said Osvaldo
Galeano, another Galeano brother and battalion commander known as
El Negro.
   Dennis Galeano said the Sandinista military ``must understand
that political power is the essential element to maintaining an
army, and they lost the elections.''
   The AP encountered Dennis and Osvaldo Galeano and about 100
other Contras in this hamlet of a dozen wooden houses on a prairie.
They were talking with about 300 peasants from around El Guau, in
central Chontales province about 100 miles east of Managua.
   ``I don't think the Resistance should disarm,'' said Santiago
Diaz, a 65-year-old peasant, referring to the Contras by their
formal name.
   ``Before the elections, the Sandinistas told us that if we voted
for UNO, they would present us with the bill,'' he said, using a
Nicaraguan phrase that can be interpreted as a threat.
   ``Well, we voted for UNO. And now, if they (Sandinistas) stay in
place, we'll all be dead. You'll see.''
   Another peasant, Candelario Benito Vargas, 60, said, ``We want
the army to leave and the Resistance to become our army. That's
what we want.
   ``If you never lived under the repression of the Sandinistas,
you don't know what it was like,'' Vargas said. ``We want those
piricuacos (an Indian word meaning dogs) to disappear.''
   Both Dennis and Osvaldo Galeano hinted the Contras themselves
might replace purged Sandinista officers.
   ``That would be the people's decision: if they ask us to replace
the officers, then we would,'' Dennis Galeano said.
   The Sandinistas have repeatedly said they will not accept the
Contras as a new Nicaraguan army, saying such a move would be
tantamount to bringing back the hated National Guard of the late
right-wing dictator Anastasio Somoza, whom the Sandinistas
overthrew in 1979.
   Outgoing President Daniel Ortega said last week the main task of
all Sandinistas was to ensure the Contras kept to their
demobilization pact.
   Asked about the possibility of a renewed war as a result of a
deadlock with the Sandinistas, Dennis Galeano said:
   ``We'll see what happens after the new government reaches power.
I don't think open war is possible. But we'll see how Dona Violeta
acts, and according to that, we may be satisfied.''

   President Bush on Monday signed a bill
requiring the government to keep track of crimes against
minorities, saying ``hate crimes cannot be tolerated in a free
society.''
   At a White House ceremony attended by leaders of various
minorities, including gay-rights advocates, Bush called the measure
``a significant step to help guarantee civil rights for every
American.''
   Under the legislation, the Justice Department will keep
statistics on offenses related to race, religion, sexual
orientation and ethnicity as part of the FBI's annual uniform crime
report.
   Approval of the so-called ``hate crimes'' bill followed
complaints about a wave of such offenses on the part of neo-Nazi
``skinheads'' and others.
   ``Bigotry and hate regrettably still exist in this country and
hate breeds violence, threatening the security of our entire
society,'' Bush said. ``We must rid our communities of the poison
we call prejudice, bias and discrimination.''
   The president also said the Justice Department would establish a
toll-free number for reporting complaints of such crimes.
   ``The faster we can find out about these heinous crimes, the
faster we can track down the bigots who commit them,'' Bush said.
``Hate crimes cannot be tolerated in a free society.''
   The signing ceremony ``marks the first time in history that
lesbian and gay Americans have been invited to a White House
bill-signing ceremony,'' the Human Rights Campaign Fund said in a
statement.
   Eight representatives of the national gay-rights organization
were invited, said fund president Tim McFeeley.
   Bush, McFeeley said, ``understands how destructive crimes of
bigotry and prejudice _ including gay bashing _ are to the fabric
of American society.''
   The bill's chief sponsor, Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said after
the ceremony that he viewed the inclusion of ``sexual orientation''
in the law as a major element of the bill.
   Bush said the administration would work with Congress ``to
determine whether new law enforcement measures are needed to bring
hatemongers out of hiding and into the light of justice.''
   ``As we speak, 17 racist skinheads in Dallas are waiting to be
sentenced by a federal court for conspiring to commit hate crimes
against Jewish, black and Hispanic citizens,'' Bush said.
   ``Mail bombings that killed a federal judge and an NAACP lawyer
are being investigated tenaciously by federal authorities. We will
not rest until the cowards that committed these senseless crime are
behind bars.''

<HEAD>Witness: Youth Charged in Murder Trial Boasted of Guns.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A key prosecution witness in the slaying of a
black teen-ager by a gang of whites last summer testified Monday
that one of the youths standing trial for murder boasted of having
guns shortly before the killing.
   Gina Feliciano, whom defense lawyers say was the spark that led
to the slaying of Yusef Hawkins, 16, on Aug. 23, 1989, said she
heard Keith Mondello talk about weapons on the street below her
apartment hours before the attack.
   ``Keith was saying he had five guns altogether, three .38s and
two .45s or three .45s and two .38s,'' Miss Feliciano told the jury
in Brooklyn's state Supreme Court.
   She said Mondello then bragged, ``That he can't wait for
tonight.''
   Mondello and another white defendant, Joseph Fama, both 19, are
charged with two counts of second-degree murder and other crimes.
If convicted, they face up to 25 years to life.
   Prosecutors say Fama was the gunman who fatally shot Hawkins and
Mondello organized the mob that attacked the black teens.
   Defense lawyers say the white youths gathered in front of Miss
Feliciano's apartment because they believed she had invited black
and Hispanic friends whom they considered outsiders and
troublemakers to her 18th birthday party.
   The youths, from the mostly white neighborhood of Bensonhurst in
Brooklyn, were armed with baseball bats to protect themselves, the
lawyers maintain.
   A sobbing Miss Feliciano testified that she later was looking
out a bedroom window shortly after 9 p.m. when she saw Hawkins and
three other blacks walking along the street. The four were in the
neighborhood to look at a used car and did not know Miss Feliciano.
   She testified that she heard Mondello use a racial epithet to
describe Hawkins and his companions.
   Hawkins and his friends were followed by the whites, many
carrying bats and guns, she said. She said Mondello and two other
whites charged in the attack, James Patino and Joseph Serrano, were
in the gang.
   ``They all had guns,'' she said of the three young men.
   ``How do you know they were guns?'' asked Justice Thaddeus
Owens, the trial judge.
   ``Cause I seen them,'' Miss Feliciano replied.
   She said she heard several shots and the whites scattered.
   Miss Feliciano said she saw Fama, but without a gun.

   Survivors of 28 workers killed when an
apartment building collapsed during construction three years ago
Monday say the debris-strewn vacant lot at the site is a painful
reminder of the tragedy.
   On the anniversary, city officials unveiled plans to erect an
apartment building on the site of the L'Ambiance Plaza complex,
where 11 stories of concrete collapsed on the workers.
   Politicians and friends and relatives of the victims gathered
Monday a half-mile from the site to place flowers on a stone
memorial, offer words to the victims' families and announce plans
for the five-story housing complex, to be called Renaissance Plaza.
   Construction of the apartment complex is the final piece in the
$41 million settlement reached in December 1988 between the
survivors and the project's developers.
   Under the settlement, ownership of the land and anything built
on it is transferred from the developers to the victims' families,
said Richard A. Bieder, the attorney who represented the families
in a class action lawsuit.
   The building will consist of 60 to 80 apartments for low- and
middle-income tenants.
   Federal investigators blamed the collapse on the failure of a
hydraulic jack used to lift floor slabs into place in a building
technique known as lift-slab construction. The jack's failure
created a chain reaction that brought down the entire building.
   ``It was a terrible, terrible sight and it was a scary, scary
sight, with all the rubble down on everybody,'' recalled Frank J.
Carroll Jr., president of the Bridgeport Building Trades, who
helped with rescue efforts.
   Rescue workers dug through the rubble for nine days but only
found one survivor.
   ``That gave us some kind of hope that we would be fortunate
enough to get more,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, that was not the
case.''
   The new $9 million building is being built by two Hartford
developers who are putting up $3.4 million. The rest will be
financed by the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority and the state
Department of Housing.
   Groundbreaking is expected this summer.
   ``It's nice to see them get rid of the rubble, but I would have
liked to have seen a park,'' said David Schneider, whose uncle,
Mario Colello, was among the victims.
   Others, especially construction workers who attended Monday's
service, said they will be glad to see a building rise from the
rubble.
   ``The scars are really too ugly,'' said Bridgeport electrician
Dave Henshaw, who lost a friend in the disaster and searched for
others in the rubble. ``You don't need to drive by on an almost
daily basis and see the twisted metal and concrete.''
   But construction workers are less satisfied with efforts to
improve job safety.
   Congress has still not enacted legislation pushed by Sen.
Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., and Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn.,
to improve safety requirements and give more authority to the
federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   During the memorial service, OSHA head Gerard F. Scannell said
he had been able to enact a number of administrative changes, such
as a new office within OSHA that will concentrate on reducing
construction hazards and responding to emergencies.
   He also said new standards would take effect this summer
governing the lift-slab construction like that used at L'Ambiance.
   ``Our resolve must be that another L'Ambiance Plaza disaster
will never again happen in America,'' he said.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
149,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices for delivery
next month under a long-term grain supply agreement, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Christoper E. Goldthwaite, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was sold
by two private companies, which will receive subsidies under the
department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Goldthwaite said 563,950 tons of wheat remain in the Soviet
Union's current EEP allocation. Only wheat has been approved for
sale to the Soviets under the price-subsidy program.
   The seventh year of the U.S.-Soviet grain agreement began Oct.
1. With the latest sales, the Soviet Union has bought more than 3.2
million tons of wheat for 1989-90 delivery and more than 13.1
million tons of corn, plus soybeans and soybean meal.
   All of the wheat was sold under EEP arrangements.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 149,000 tons are equal to nearly 5.5 million bushels
worth about $19 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   Goldthwaite reported the subsidies at an average of $28.87 per
ton, or about 79 cents per bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   Goldthwaite said the latest wheat was sold by Continental Grain
Co., 99,000 tons; and J. Aron &amp; Co., 50,000.

<HEAD>Ford Memo Supported Israel's Retention of Golan Heights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Gerald R. Ford in 1975 secretly
promised Israel that the United States would seriously consider
backing Israel's retention of territory on the Golan Heights
captured from Syria, according to a report by an Israeli think tank.
   The territory had been used before the 1967 Six Day War for Arab
attacks on villages in northern Israel. It has served since then as
a security buffer for the Jewish state, but Syria is demanding its
return.
   Ford, in a letter to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, said the
United States had not decided what position to take on the borders
between Israel and its Arab neighbors, including Syria.
   ``Should it do so,'' Ford wrote Sept. 1, ``it will give great
weight to Israel's position that any peace agreement with Syria
must be predicated on Israel remaining on the Golan Heights.''
   At the time, Israel had agreed to relinquish key positions in
the Sinai desert to Egypt.
   In his letter, Ford called the withdrawal arranged through
shuttle-diplomacy by Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, ``an
act of great significance.''
   Ford promised to maintain Israel's defensive strength through
the supply of advanced F-16 jet aircraft. He also promised that
``the U.S. will support the position that an overall settlement
with Syria in the framework fo a peace agreement must assure
Israel's security from attack from the Golan Heights.''
   The letter, which had been classified secret, was published by
the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies of
Jerusalem in a report titled, ``Can Israel Survive A Palestinian
State?''
   ``I think it's authentic,'' said an official who served in the
Ford administration and was involved in Mideast diplomacy. ``It
refers to a conversation Ford had with Rabin in the Oval Office.''
   The assurance ``probably was not as categorical as the Israelis
would have liked,'' said the ex-official, insisting on anonymity.
``It sympathizes with the Israeli position without binding us to it
fully and without prejudging the outcome.''
   The main conclusion of the study was that establishment of a
Palestinian State on the West Bank and in Gaza, territories also
captured by Israel in the 1967 war, would pose a danger to the
Jewish state.
   ``A Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan River would not
bring a stable Middle East peace,'' the report said. ``Rather it
would likely lead to chronic regional instability ending in a
general Arab-Israeli war.''
   An independent Palestinian state would be run by the Palestine
Liberation Organization, the report said. ``It would be a
springboard for surrounding hostile states.''
   The report was to be made public at a news conference here
Tuesday. It was sponsored by the Simon Wiesenthal Center of Los
Angeles.
   Israel returned part of the Golan Heights to Syria in 1974 in an
agreement mediated by Kissinger. Israel subsequently extended its
legal authority _ a step short of annexation _ to the rest of the
territory.
   The Bush administration has taken the position that Israel
should relinquish occupied territory on all fronts _ the West Bank,
Gaza and the Golan Heights. However, U.S. officials have not
specified if that means all the land lost by the Arabs in the 1967
war should be returned.
   The report stressed the importance of the West Bank as ``a
natural tank trap,'' saying control of the region would enable
Israel to repel a coalition of Arab armies that hold a manpower
advantage.

<HEAD>Congress Cutting On Farm Commodity Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new budget-cutting package in the House is
putting a further squeeze on farm bill costs, Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter said Monday.
   The package announced last week by Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
chairman of the House Budget Committee, would hold Agriculture
Department spending on farm income support under federal commodity
programs to $9.8 billion in the fiscal year that will begin on Oct.
1, he said.
   An administration budget plan sent to Congress in January called
for $10.2 billion, a reduction of $1.5 billion from the increase
that normally would occur if annual ``baseline'' spending trends
were followed.
   Yeutter told a meeting of the National Association of
Agricultural Journalists that the administration and he, in
particular, had come in for severe partisan criticism for the
proposed $1.5 billion spending reduction.
   The budget figures by Panetta will be even harder for House
Agriculture Committee leadership to reckon with because those
amount to a $1.9 billion cut from the baseline, he said.
   ``We now have a much different situation in farm legislation
than we did a few days ago,'' Yeutter said.
   However, the situation also depends on whose baseline is being
used. The current USDA baseline is $11.7 billion, which was based
on crop indications last fall. Thus, a $1.5 billion reduction would
be required to needed to lower fiscal 1991 spending to the $10.2
billion cited by Yeutter as the Bush proposal.
   The Panetta figure of $9.8 billion was derived from a
Congressional Budget Office baseline of $10.6 billion computed as
of February.
   Under that computation, the Panetta budget reduction would be
only $800 million, not the $1.9 billion Yeutter said.
   Regardless of whose figures are used, farm commodity programs
are in for some more paring. And Yeutter made the point that it
will be even more urgent for the United States to seek a favorable
conclusion to the Uruguay Round negotiations under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The GATT talks, scheduled to conclude at the end of this year,
are aimed a liberalizing world trade.
   The U.S. position on agricultural trade calls for the gradual
elimination of all trade-distorting policies and subsidies over a
period of years.
   Yeutter said there is a feeling in some U.S. agricultural
circles that the GATT talks are being overemphasized and that
farmers would be better off relying on Congress to write generous
price and income support provisions in the new farm bill.
   But there will ``not be a lucrative price package'' in the farm
bill, Yeutter said. Therefore, farmers will have to generate more
of their income from the marketplace.
   ``We're simply not going to have the flow of federal tax dollars
into agriculture in the coming year that we've had in the past,''
he said.
   Yeutter said a two-price dairy plan approved last week by a
House Agriculture subcommittee has some ``very negative'' features
and would put a heavier cost burden on consumers.
   Members of the House wheat, soybeans and feed grains
subcommittee also faced grim financial reality last week when
Panetta announced the budget figures.
   The lawmakers' plans for price supports would cost $16 billion
more over the five-year life of the bill than the budget would
allow, committee staff said.
   The sections of the farm bill dealing with those commodities
were put on hold until this Thursday while the lawmakers find
places to cut.

<TEXT>
   The vanities blazed in the Bronx on Monday and
courthouse regular Ed McCarthy was steamed. ``It's total chaos,''
he barked, relating in detail his failed search for a parking spot.
``Maybe the book was right.''
   The book is ``The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' Tom Wolfe's
best-selling story of avarice, ego and corruption in New York, and
the chaos was occasioned by the arrival of on-location filming for
the movie.
   There was a 200-member film crew. There were stars _ people such
as Tom Hanks and Bruce Willis. There was a simulated subway stop.
There were two 100-foot cranes to spray simulated rain. There were
hundreds of onlookers.
   And naturally, there was a traffic jam.
   ``They had to pick a Monday. They couldn't do it on the
weekend,'' groused McCarthy, veteran spokesman of the district
attorney's office. ``So now I'm parked at a bus stop where some
idiot will give me a ticket. And I'll have to go downtown to get it
fixed.''
   McCarthy was joking about the ticket, but not about the rest _
and he wasn't alone. ``It's making everybody's life miserable,''
said Nick Kavalos, owner of a delicatessen across the street. ``The
bread guy had to park two blocks away and carry in my delivery.''
   Others took a more benign view of the proceedings, which focused
on a corner outside the Mario Merola Building, housing the Bronx
County courthouse. About 200 people watched, obligingly hushing
during takes, then resuming their chatter-punctuated gawking at the
stars.
   ``In Manhattan, you see it all the time. Not in the Bronx,''
said Max Gottlieb, a jeweler and aspiring screenwriter who had
traveled from his Manhattan office to watch. ``Up here, it's a
major event.''
   ``So far I've seen only Tom Hanks,'' said Elba Vargas, smiling
in the sun with her year-old daughter, Christine. ``Also Geraldo,''
she appended, meaning television personality Geraldo Rivera, who
had a 12-word part.
   ``It's pretty good for the Bronx. This area is still in a
rebuilding stage and to have something like this here, it's a boost
to the economy,'' said Ron Romano, a clerk in the courthouse.
``It's a morale boost, too.''
   The economic benefit garnered some debate. The city says feature
film producers spend roughly $100,000 per day locally when shooting
here, and the ``Bonfire'' filming may take five weeks.
   But Kavalos, of the Court Deli, noted with resignation that the
crew's meals were catered elsewhere. ``Look around. You don't see
nobody,'' said one of his waitresses, Chris Ripkin. ``All we get is
bathroom customers.''
   There was a more serious economic issue, as well. ``It's fantasy
land, that's what it is,'' said the Rev. James McClain, who passed
by the crowd and kept on his way. ``They spend $30 million or $40
million for a picture, and there's people here who can't afford to
feed their children.''
   An equally harsh reality showed its face three blocks from the
filming: Just before noon the driver of a van fired a gunshot,
tried to run over a police officer and then sped off, authorities
said.
   No one was hurt, and the only disruption at the movie site was a
single police car that whizzed past with sirens blaring.
   Said Kavalos: ``We're in a bad neighborhood here.''
   That is not the message the leaders of the Bronx wish to send
out, and they eyed the movie-making warily. ``They're in here to
make money, but I don't think they're in here to take advantage of
the people of the Bronx,'' said Clint Roswell, spokesman for
Borough President Fernando Ferrer. ``They've certainly expressed a
willingness not to do broad smear.''
   One sign of good will: Plans to decorate the recently cleaned
courthouse with ersatz graffiti were dropped. ``I can definitely
confirm that there is no fake graffiti,'' said Rob Harris,
spokesman for the distributor, Warner Bros.
   Harris said little else, averring that Warner had made a
``marketing decision'' not to encourage media coverage of the movie
just yet. Still, some potential customers had already made up their
minds.
   ``Am I going to go to the movie? No,'' said Kavalos. ``When they
put it on TV, maybe.''

<HEAD>Ag Reports Say Western States Will Have Low Water Supplies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western states will have low water supplies
this summer in many areas, an Agriculture Department report said
Monday.
   ``With snowfall virtually over and snowmelt beginning, it looks
like spring and summer streamflows will be below average for most
of the West,'' said Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil
Conservation Service.
   ``The wise use of water will be more important than ever.''
   Streamflows are forecast to be less than 70 percent of average
in California, Nevada, Arizona, most of Oregon, Utah and New
Mexico, southern Idaho, southwestern Wyoming and western Colorado.
   The only western areas where streamflows are expected to be
above average are most streams in southern Alaska, the Cache la
Poudre River in Colorado, and the headwaters of the Tongue River in
Wyoming, and the Kootenai River in Canada and Montana, the report
said.
   Reservoir storage as of March 31 was reported ``near to slightly
above average for most of the western states.''
   New Mexico was the only one with ``well-above average''
reservoir water supplies. Nevada, Arizona and California were said
to be ``well-below average.''
   Western states depend on snowmelt for about 75 percent of their
water supply.

republic is made more difficult because her United National
Opposition is a 14-party coalition that spans the political
spectrum from communists to conservatives.
   But Mrs. Chamorro will be taking over following the mandate of
free elections on Feb. 25, something rare in this tropical nation
of 3.5 million residents. Nicaragua has been ruled by autocratic
and oppressive governments much of the time since it gained
independence in 1821.
   ``It's the beginning of democracy in Nicaragua,'' Mrs. Chamorro
said when she and Vice President-elect Virgilio Godoy were
officially presented with their election certificate Monday by the
Supreme Electoral Council.
   Nevertheless, it will be a tough start for Mrs. Chamorro, 61, a
newspaper publisher who has little political and no governmental
experience. She has been relying on a team of experienced advisers
to develop economic plans and negotiate with fractious Contras and
Sandinistas.
   The Contras are foremost among the problems her administration
faces. They have been fighting the Sandinistas for nine years and
don't want to demobilize, as they promised to do so by June 10,
unless the army is purged of Sandinista officers.
   Mrs. Chamorro's team has agreed to ``respect the professional
status'' of the Sandinista army but forbid its officers to hold any
positions in political parties.
   Some Contras want their officers to replace Sandinista officers,
something that could lead to conflict with still-militant
Sandinistas. The army is under their political control and many
party activists also have modern weapons.
   Mrs. Chamorro has repeatedly said Nicaragua cannot support a big
army anyway _ the economy, hurt over the years by a now-ended U.S.
embargo and ineffectual Sandinista policies, is in shambles.
   Inflation in 1988 hit 33,600 percent until the Sandinistas
curbed spending and brought it down last year to 1,800 percent.
Even so, the Chamorro administration will have to do a lot of
belt-tightening to bring it to acceptable levels.
   They need to stabilize the currency, attract foreign investment
and bring back some of the money people stashed away abroad for
safe-keeping.
   As it is, Nicaragua is saddled with a $7 billion foreign debt it
can hardly meet payments on and that will need renegotiating with
creditor banks.
   President Bush has asked for $300 million in immediate aid to
help the Chamorro administration through its first months in
office, but the U.S. Congress has been moving slowly and, in any
case, the amount will not solve all problems.
   ``We don't have anything, but I have confidence in Nicaraguans
and in our friends from the exterior to reconstruct Nicaragua,''
she told journalists Monday.
   Mrs. Chamorro's financial adviser, Francisco Mayorga, says the
new administration will not know until after the inauguration how
much cash the Treasury has. Government employees must be paid five
days after she takes office.
   Even the number of government employees is unknown. The
Sandinistas haven't been giving out any figures, although outgoing
President Daniel Ortega talked in 1989 of having to fire 30,000
government employees as part of his austerity program.
   For many years, the government rationed gasoline to save on
crude oil, which the Sandinistas imported from the Soviet Union via
Cuba. Venezuela and Mexico cut off sales about three years ago
because Nicaragua was not paying even at below-market rates.
   Right now, the country has two months' reserves and Cuba is
cutting off sales, meaning Mrs. Chamorro's administration will have
to buy on the open market.
   The Sandinistas, who got 40 percent of the vote in the February
elections and are still the country's biggest single political
party, have been distributing land titles and making other moves to
entrench their reforms.
   UNO has also accused Sandinista sympathizers of stripping
government assets, down to the office furniture.
   But Sandinista policies, including price controls and limited
investment, hurt farm and livestock production in this largely
agricultural nation, a problem that will become another priority
for Mrs. Chamorro's administration.
   As recently as January, the country had to import rice _ which
it used to export _ and received a donated shiploand of beans from
Spain, because it did not grow enough of these staples to feed the
population.

   Showers and thunderstorms were widely scattered over the
Mississippi Valley on Monday, and northern California got locally
heavy rain.
   The strongest thunderstorms along the Mississippi Valley were
over northern Iowa and southern Minnesota, the National Weather
Service said.
   Showers associated with a cold front moving off the Pacific
Ocean produced the rain in northern California.
   Fresno Calif. got 0.43 of an inch, a record for the day, and
Shelter Cove got 1.40 inches during the early morning. Sacramento
got a record 0.52 of an inch Sunday.
   Rain also fell during the day Monday over parts of Washington
and Oregon.
   Elsewhere, a few showers and thunderstorms associated with a
cold front were over Florida and showers developed along a cold
front from the northern high Plains to the Great Basin making up
most of Nevada and western Utah.
   Ahead of that cold front, temperatures in the upper 80s were
reported as far north as North Dakota and Minnesota. On Sunday,
Chamberlain and Pickstown, S.D., both reached 94 degrees, tying
Presidio, Texas, as the hottest spots in the nation.
   Late Sunday, thunderstorms produced severe weather from Florida
to the southern and central Plains. One person was killed near
Biloxi, Miss., when strong thunderstorm wind overturned several
boats in the Mississippi Sound, and at least one tornado touched
down briefly near Jacksonville, Fla. Sunday evening, hail 2 inches
in diameter was reported 15 miles southwest of Roswell, N.M.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 32 at Elkins, W.Va.

<TEXT>
   It's unlikely that Kimberly Hardy, a
black welfare mother, and Lynn Bremer, a successful white attorney,
would ever have been thrown together if not for one thing they had
in common: cocaine addiction.
   Bremer joined Hardy last week as two of the first women in
Michigan to be charged with delivering cocaine to their babies by
allegedly using the drug just before giving birth.
   The cases are drawing renewed attention not only to the practice
of prosecuting drug-addicted mothers but also to the misconception
that is it primarily the poor, uneducated woman using drugs during
pregnancy.
   ``We're finding that drug addiction during pregnancy is a
problem that crosses all income and social levels, particularly
when it comes to cocaine,'' said Suzanne Miel-Uken of the Michigan
Department of Public Health's office of maternal and child health.
   A study conducted last year in Pinellas County, Fla., found no
substantial difference in the rate of substance abuse between
pregnant women undergoing care in public clinics and more affluent
women in private care, according to the National Association for
Perinatal Addiction and Research and Education.
   About 14.8 percent of all American babies born last year were
exposed to controlled substances before birth, the organization
said.
   There are 30 to 40 similar similar cases pending across the
country.
   ``Think of how many cases of drug-addicted births there must be
in Detroit _ all over the state, but women aren't being prosecuted
there,'' said attorney Alan Rapoport of the American Civil
Liberties Union, who represents Bremer and Hardy. ``The only places
where this is happening is the little jerkwater towns where the
local prosecutor wants to make headlines.''
   On Monday, Muskegon County Circuit Judge R. Max Daniels denied a
request by Rapoport to dismiss the cocaine-delivery charge against
Hardy. However, the judge did dismiss a less serious charge of
second-degree child-abuse, saying there was no evidence Hardy's
cocaine use had caused her son's low birthweight and
gastrointestinal problems.
   The cocaine-delivery charges carries a maximum penalty of 20
years in prison; second-degree child abuse is punishable by a
maximum of four years in pison.
   Muskegon County Prosecutor Tony Tague says he is using the
threat of prosecution to urge addicted mothers to seek treatment
during pregnancy.
   ``We're trying to send a message _ that if you are a
drug-addicted pregnant women and you seek meaningful treatment
during your pregnancy, you will not be prosecuted,'' Tague said. He
said if Bremer had sought treatment during her pregnancy, which her
doctor had recommended, she likely wouldn't be facing charges.
   Bremer, 36, checked herself into a 30-day drug treatment center
April 15, five days after her daughter, Brittany, was born at
Hackley Hospital. Tests showed evidence of cocaine in the systems
of both mother and daughter. Bremer was charged Thursday but won't
be arraigned until she is released from the center.
   Tague said Bremer, a general practice attorney since 1982,
admitted using cocaine throughout her pregnancy up until about 48
hours before delivery. Police say Hardy, 22, admitted using crack
cocaine about 13 hours before she gave birth in August. She was
charged in October and went into drug treatment, which she has
completed.
   Rapoport and many health-care providers contend Tague's approach
will keep drug-addicted pregnant women out of prenatal programs for
fear of prosecution.
   Tague contends that Hardy and Bremer passed cocaine to their
babies through the umbilical cord seconds after the infant exited
the birth canal and before the cord was cut. Under Michigan law, a
woman cannot be charged with injuring or delivering anything to a
fetus.
   Tague has said he wouldn't seek prison time for the women.
Conviction on the 20-year felony charge includes one year of
mandatory imprisonment, but the statute allows for a departure from
the mandatory minimum if the court finds ``substantial and
compelling reasons'' to do so.
   The infants born to Bremer and Hardy appear healthy, but
research suggests babies exposed to cocaine while in the womb
suffer from a distressing array of brain disorders and medical
problems that appear to stunt their development for years, if not
permanently.
   Bremer's daughter is in the custody of the state Department of
Social Services and was placed in a foster home Tuesday. Hardy's
newborn son and other two children were taken from her and are
living with her parents in Mississippi. Both women are single.

<HEAD>Luken Criticizes Bush Commitment to Environment in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Ohio congressman said Monday that he's not
convinced the Bush administration is putting enough emphasis on
environmental protection in Eastern Europe as it rushes to help
emerging democracies.
   ``Over the last few months we have been watching the Iron
Curtain rise only to reveal a ruined landscape blanketed in
devastating toxic industrial pollution,'' said Rep. Thomas Luken,
Democratic chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
on transportation and hazardous materials.
   But, he said, a turf war between the Environmental Protection
Agency and the Agency for International Development threatens the
U.S. environmental programs in Eastern Europe.
   ``Movement is afoot to hand over these U.S. environmental
programs to the Agency for International Development, even though
all the expertise is at EPA,'' Luken said.
   Timothy Atkeson, who is in charge of international activities at
EPA, said environmental experts will be working with Eastern
Europeans though they may be private contractors hired through AID.
   ``The president has asked for flexibility,'' Atkeson said at a
hearing of Luken's subcommittee.
   ``Some programs would be best addressed by the EPA, some by the
Department of Energy and some the private sector through AID
contracts,'' Atkeson said.
   He said EPA would be the lead agency.
   But Luken admonished:
   ``In the rush to provide ecomomic assistance to these ruined
nations, it is imperative that we not commit the very mistakes that
their own governments have made since the Second World War by
choosing development at the expense of the environment.''

   Hand-delivered messages claimed
responsibility Monday for vandalism that caused two power outages
and left about 92,000 people without power for six hours.
   Residents of Santa Cruz and Watsonville were affected by the
outages Sunday and early Monday, caused by damage to Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric power poles.
   The group that claimed responsibility for the two outages called
itself Earth Night Action Group and said the target was PG&amp;E, a
``corporate earth rapist.''
   A young male caller to The Associated Press telephoned a few
minutes after delivery of the message to ask if it had been
received. Similar messages went to Bay City News Service and the
San Francisco Examiner. The caller refused to give his name or
telephone number.
   Electricity was out for almost two hours late Sunday after
utility crews accidentally ignited a small fire while they repaired
a high-voltage wooden power pole that apparently had been cut by a
chain saw, said PG&amp;E spokesman Ron Rutkowski.
   The second outage, beginning shortly after 1:30 a.m. Monday,
affected the same area and was caused when someone cut all the
bolts at the base of a steel tower near Watsonville, the utility
company said. Power was restored to all customers by 5:25 a.m.
   Rutkowski said the incidents were reported to the Santa Cruz
Sheriff's Department.

   Guards with electronic stun guns quelled
a three-hour disturbance Monday by 20 inmates in a state prison
unit housing prisoners under investigation for a bloody three-day
riot in October.
   At least one inmate kicked through a cell wall during the
three-hour ruckus at the Camp Hill medium-security prison, and
about 60 cells were flooded in the restricted cellblock, said
prison spokesman John Palakovitch.
   Two guards and two inmates were injured during the disturbance
in the cell block, which holds inmates being investigated for the
October riot. That uprising left more than half the prison
destroyed and 123 people injured.
   Inmates repeatedly have threatened to riot again once state
police brought in during the October riots are removed from the
prison. The state police, who were not used in Monday's incident,
are scheduled to leave beginning Tuesday.
   The ruckus was the worst at the prison since October, and
investigations continue into both disturbances.
   Around 1 a.m., an inmate under investigation for allegedly
participating in the October riots removed a porcelain toilet from
the wall, smashed it and began throwing pieces at guards,
Palakovich said.
   About 20 inmates began throwing things and turned on water in
their cells, flooding about 64 of them. Some soaked their sheets
with water and used them to tie their cell doors closed to keep
guards out, Palakovich said.
   Palakovich said there was no security risk because inmates
didn't get out of the cells involved.
   By 4 a.m. guards had handcuffed the prisoners in their cells,
and a cell-by-cell search for weapons or contraband was underway,
he said.

<HEAD>FAA Requires Warning System On Small Passenger Planes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turboprop passenger planes will have to have a
ground-proximity warning system under federal regulations announced
Monday.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said the rule, which would
become final after a period for public comment, follows a study of
accidents in which pilots have flown aircraft into the ground with
no apparent awareness that they were about to crash.
   Of 41 such accidents from 1970 to 1988, two-thirds could have
been prevented with such a system, the FAA said. The study was
conducted by the Transportation Department on a recommendation from
the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates
accidents.
   A ground-proximity warning system sounds an alarm when a plane
that is not preparing to land goes below a set altitude. If the
aircraft has its flaps and wheels down for landing, the alarm does
not sound.
   The FAA said 695 turboprop aircraft would have to add the
system, which has been required on large jetliners since 1974 and
on smaller jets since 1978. Warning devices were not previously
required for turboprops, the FAA said, because ``it was believed at
the time that they had a greater ability to respond quickly in
situations where altitude control was inadvertently neglected.''

   President Bush signed legislation Monday
delaying a regulation that could have put many organizations that
arrange human organ transplants out of business.
   The measure delays from April 1, 1990, to Jan. 1, 1992, a
performance standard that would have denied Medicare or Medicaid
reimbusement to human organ procurement organizations that arrange
fewer than 50 donors a year.
   There are 71 such organizations; more than half procure organs
from fewer than 50 donors annually.
   The Department of Health and Human Services supported the delay.
The procurement organizations are expected to press in the interim
for a different performance standard.

<HEAD>British Minister Calls Driver Innocent, Cargo Guilty in Seizure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British truck driver held in Greece on suspicion
of importing part of an Iraqi ``super gun'' is innocent, Foreign
Office minister William Waldegrave said Monday.
   But he told Parliament little doubt exists that the 29-ton cargo
was intended to be part of a huge weapon that Iraq was reportedly
building.
   Truck driver Paul Ashwell, 25, from Northampton, England, was
moved to Greece's top-security Agios Stefanos prison on Monday.
   He was charged Saturday with ``a distinct instance of
transporting a rapid-firing weapon, at the level of criminal
charges'' _ an offense carrying a minimum five-year prison term.
   Customs officials in the port of Patras in western Greece,
working with British customs officers, on Friday seized a truck
carrying cargo from Sheffield Forgemasters _ a giant cylinder said
to be part of a huge gun.
   ``I don't know a thing ... about war material,'' Ashwell told
reporters Saturday. ``I was not obligated to know the nature of my
cargo.''
   On April 12, Customs officers seized eight sections of steel
pipe at a British port after a military expert said it could be
used as a gun. The Iraqi government and the maker, Sheffield
Forgemasters, said the tubes were intended for a petrochemical
plant.
   British Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley said the government was
convinced the tubes were part of a huge gun. Weapons experts say
such a gun, with a 131-foot-long barrel, might be able to fire
nuclear or chemical weapons long distances or boost rockets into
orbit.
   Ashwell's truck was stopped April 11, but he said he was told it
was because of faulty documentation for his cargo. He was allowed
to return to London, and was arrested after he returned to Greece.
   Lawmaker Michael Morris told Waldegrave he believed Ashwell was
being made ``a scapegoat fot he whole of this exercise.''
   Waldegrave responded: ``Greece is a law-abiding country. ...
They do have an offense of importing a gun, and they have to answer
to their own courts as to whether he has committed any offense.''
   Waldegrave said Britain did not believe Ashwell was guilty of
any offense.
   Michael Cave Ltd., a freight hauling firm, on Monday issued a
statement saying the driver and the agents were ``completely
innocent victims.''
   Turkish police have detained a second truck, with two Hungarian
drivers, carrying a 33-foot-long pipe forged by Walter Somers Ltd.
of Halesowen, near Birmingham, England.
   Walter Somers Ltd, acknowledged Friday that it had made the
cylinder and said it was commissioned by Iraq.
   The British freight agent, Davies Turner Ltd., said two trucks
carrying steel forging from Walter Somers reached the Iraqi capital
on April 9 and 10.
   In Istanbul, Turkey a customs official confirmed Monday that
authorities seized a steel tube believed to belong to a giant Iraqi
weapon.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
Hungarian trailer-truck carrying the 33-foot-long steel tube was
being kept at the Haydarpasa customs station on the Asian side of
Istanbul.
   He said the truck arrived in Istanbul last Thursday.
   Finance and Customs Minister Adnan Kahveci was quoted as telling
Hurriyet newspaper that ``a massive investigation'' was under way.
   Turkish dailies on Saturday quoted authorities as saying the
confiscated cargo resembled pipes seized in Britain last week.

   A flight to Baltimore from San Juan, Puerto

   The man, who was not identified, spent the night in Miami and

said.
   The airplane refueled during a 30-minute stop in Miami, then
continued on to Baltimore's Washington International Airport, he
said.

<TEXT>
   A man found guilty of murder more than 32
years after his young cousin was found sodomized and strangled was
sentenced Monday to life in prison.
   Albany County Court Judge Thomas Keegan handed down the maximum
sentence possible against Richard Ruff, 53, who was convicted March
23 of strangling 11-year-old William Ruff Jr.
   The boy was killed on Aug. 31, 1957. His body was found the next
day, hanging by a clothesline from a tree in a wooded area near his
home in the Albany suburb of Colonie.
   In convicting Ruff of first-degree felony murder, the jury found
that he had killed his cousin in the commission or the attempted
commission of sodomy. His sentence carries no minimum term, based
on 1957 state law.
   The case marked the longest homicide investigation in state
history, prosecutors said.
   Ruff, reserved and dressed in prison greens, maintained his
innocence Monday morning.
   ``I just never sodomized nobody. I never killed anybody,'' Ruff
said. ``... And that's the truth.''
   But Keegan told him: ``Here we had a young boy who trusted his
family members. ... (Billy) was used for your own self-serving
purposes.''
   Keegan ordered the sentence to run consecutively with a 4- to
12-year term Ruff is serving for sexually abusing two young girls,
daughters of a woman with whom he lived in Rensselaer County.
   The judge denied a motion by Public Defender Joseph McCoy to
dismiss the conviction on the grounds of insufficient evidence.
McCoy said his office would appeal.
   Billy's mother, Mildred Ruff, watched the sentencing then told
reporters in a choked voice: ``We're relieved that it's all over.''
   ``May God have mercy on his soul,'' she said of Ruff.
   Ruff was not considered a suspect in the killing until two years
ago. In 1988, Christopher Ruff, a brother of the victim who is now
an Albany County sheriff's deputy, noticed a police bulletin
indicating that Richard Ruff was wanted in connection with the
child sex-abuse case in Rensselaer County.
   Police found Ruff in Florida and questioned him on both cases.
He was returned to Albany to stand trial, in the Rensselaer case
first.
   Dwyer based much of his case on statements Ruff made to police
in Florida.

<HEAD>U.S. Agency Denounces Publication of Names of Agents in Mexico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration said
Monday that the publication of the names of 49 DEA agents in Mexico
by a Mexican news magazine was an ``irresponsible act'' that could
put them in danger.
   The DEA said in a statement that the agency is ``open about our
presence'' in 46 countries but ``we do not publish the names or
location of our personnel for obvious security reasons.''
   ``Publication of the names of DEA special agents and others ...
by Proceso was an irresponsible act that could potentially threaten
the safety of these people,'' DEA said.
   DEA spokesman Conn Dougherty said ``the motivation behind this
is still a mystery to us.''
   ``We don't think it's any sort of retaliation at all'' for the
arrest by DEA agents of a Guadalajara gynecologist on charges of
participating in the 1985 murder of DEA agent Enrique Camarena,
Dougherty said.
   Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain was taken by plane to El Paso,
Texas, where he was arrested by DEA agents. An attorney for Alvarez
contends the doctor was abducted and taken to the border.
   That arrest earlier this month sparked a diplomatic protest from
Mexico, which demanded a full explanation from the U.S. government.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said a preliminary report of
the arrest by DEA indicates that no U.S. agents were present when
Alvarez was captured and flown to El Paso.
   Dougherty said he was unaware of any special security
precautions that the DEA agents in Mexico were taking as a result
of the publication of their names.
   ``We're very careful that our people in all the countries
exercise proper precautions especially in countries where there may
have been any kind of disturbance or incident in the past,''
Dougherty said.

<HEAD>Albania to Allow Emigration of Six Siblings in Italian Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albanian authorities said Monday they
will allow the emigration of six siblings in Albania's capital of
Tirana who have been living as refugees in the Italian embassy for
more than four years.
   The Popaj family members, two brothers and four sisters aged 52
to 65, walked into Italia's embassy on Dec. 12, 1985, and demanded
asylum. They told diplomats they had been confined almost 20 years
to Kules, a village west of Tirana, because a brother had defected
to the West.
   It was the first known case of Albanians seeking shelter in a
Western embassy in Tirana.
   The Albanian state ATA news agency Monday quoted a Foreign
Ministry spokesman who said ``the Italian Embassy is informed ...
that if the Popaj brothers wish they are free to go abroad, being
equipped with Albanian passports and exit visas.''
   The statement added that the family could leave Albania, a
hard-line Stalinist regime that in recent months seems to be
loosening some of its controls, in one or two days after they make
a formal request to emigrate.
   It was unclear why the Albanian statement referred to the six as
brothers and there was no information on the condition of the six.
   ``This humanitarian solution ... serves also the promotion of
the spirit of friendship existing in Albanian-Italian relations,''
ATA reported.
   In reaction, an Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman said: ``There
is a readiness and will on the part of Albania, just as there is a
readiness and will on our part, for a solution.''
   Italian lawmakers have repeatedly asked Albania to permit the
emigration of the siblings.

<HEAD>Rebels Say Ethiopian Air Raid Killed 50 Civilians, Wounded 110</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethiopian warplanes dropped cluster bombs
on the guerrilla-held Red Sea port of Massawa, killing 50 civilians
and wounding 110, the rebels said Monday.
   The Eritrean People's Liberation Front said the death toll from
Sunday's air attack was expected to rise as many of the wounded
were in ``very bad condition,'' according to a clandestine radio
report monitored in the Kenyan capital Nairobi.
   The radio said 50 homes were destroyed when the warplanes made
two bombing runs on Massawa, one in the mid-morning and one in the
early evening.
   The rebel-operated Voice of the Broad Masses of Eritrea reported
no further details of the air strikes, the latest since
secessionist guerrillas captured the important port from government
forces in February.
   There was no reaction from the Ethiopian government, which
rarely comments on rebel claims. The report on the air raids could
not be independently verified because observers are banned from
areas of conflict.
   Massawa is one of two strategic harbors that have traditionally
handled most of Ethiopia's trade and international relief supplies
for millions of people threatened with starvation in the face of
war and drought.
   The Eritrean Front has been fighting for control of Ethiopia's
northernmost province since 1961, a year after the former Italian
colony of Eritrea lost its autonomy and was forcibly annexed by the
late Emperor Haile Selassie.
   Rebels hold other towns and villages in Eritrea and, with
backing from other guerrilla armies, are seeking to overthrow the
Marxist regime of President Mengistu Haile Mariam.
   The rebel radio has reported several previous raids by warplanes
dropping cluster bombs and napalm on civilians. The reports have
been denied by Addis Ababa.
   Israel has been accused of supplying the cluster bombs, which
contain dozens of smaller grenade-like bomblets that hurl shrapnel
over wide areas.
   Both Israel and Ethiopia have denied these claims.

<HEAD>Citizens Panel Finds Adult Video Offensive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PIQUA, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of residents decided the X-rated
movie ``Amber Pays the Rent'' violates community standards,
clearing the way for the removal of all adult videos from a store,
city officials announced Monday.
   More than two-thirds of the 45-member panel said the video
appealed to prurient interests, and nearly that number said it
offended their personal standards.
   The movie depicts the lives of several female roommates who pay
their bills by way of sexual favors.
   ``I think the result is clear,'' said Stephen Klein, a city
attorney for the western Ohio community of 20,000 about 30 miles
north of Dayton.
   ``The marketplace has spoken,'' he said.
   Neither owner John Rimkus of Home Video Ventures or his
attorney, Louis Sirkin, immediately responded to calls seeking
comment.
   Klein said he planned to inform Sirkin of the results and
expects all of the adult videos to be removed from the store within
about two weeks.
   The panel was approved last October as attorneys prepared for a
court fight over adult videos available at the store.
   Klein said the owner agreed to remove all adult tapes if the
vote went against the film, although the ruling was not binding to
Showcase Video, another store renting adult videos.
   ``These results are clear enough that the city will not hesitate
to proceed in court with this as evidence and attempt to have the
community standards imposed legally on the other store,'' he said.
``We now have the ammunition.''
   Klein said communities can set their own standards on obscenity
based on a 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a California case that
established the criteria. He said the test included whether the
average person finds that the material appeals to prurient
interests.
   The panel, chosen on the basis of age, race, education, income
and religion was designed to represent the makeup of Piqua. Panel
members watched the 80-minute video in individual viewings last
week and then answered two questions.
   Asked if they thought the film appealed to a morbid, shameful or
unhealthy interest in sex, 66.7 percent said yes and 31.1 percent
said no. Asked if it offended their personal standards, 64.4 said
yes and 33.3 percent said no. The remainder said they didn't know
or were undecided.
   Male and female panelists differed in their opinions. Eighty
percent of women and 50 percent of men said the film appealed to
prurient interests. Forty percent of men said the film offended
their personal standards, compared with 84 percent of women.
   Said panelist Eric Fries, 27: ``As far as a porno flick goes, it
was fairly obscene.''

<TEXT>
   Lithuanians woke Monday to a world of
impending shortages, and while the Soviet economic embargo hadn't
taken full effect yet, life wasn't exactly proceeding normally
either.
   Vilnius enjoyed another sunny spring day, and tulips were
beginning to bloom in carefully tended public gardens throughout
the Lithuanian capital. Outwardly, the city seemed to be shrugging
off the threat of a cut of most supplies from Moscow.
   But some bus routes were canceled to save fuel, consumers were
lining up for many goods and there was talk of opening ``embargo
funds'' for gasoline coupons to get the embattled Baltic republic
through what most expect will be a difficult period.
   ``Whether it's necessary or not, people are lining up to buy
it,'' said a saleswoman taking a break in the bright sun outside
the city's modern new department store. ``It's for everything. It
doesn't matter what it is.''
   Inside, there were especially long lines to get into the
department selling fabric, blankets and pillows. Long lines also
were reported in some city food stores.
   The threat of a cutoff of all shipments from the Soviet Union
has made people of this independence-minded republic realize they
have few raw materials and depend on shipments from elsewhere to
provide the materials to run their factories, said the saleswoman,
an ethnic Pole who declined to give her name.
   While people were not buying out of panic, they clearly were
stocking up just in case, she said.
   Officials of the Sajudis political movement were collecting
money for an embargo fund. At the end of a two-day congress on
Sunday, the organization collected $9,230 in rubles from its
members. An official said an elderly woman also had pledged the
$6,480 in rubles she received from the Soviet government in
compensation for being wrongly sent to Siberia years earlier.
   There also was a proposal to begin collecting items of gold that
Lithuanians wanted to contribute to sell abroad and earn foreign
currency, she said, but that idea was on hold because there was no
safe place to store it.
   Some bus routes into downtown were canceled. Residents of the
Virsuliskis district outside Vilnius were forced to find another
way to get to work Monday morning.
   All along the route of Bus 11 through downtown, handwritten
notes were pasted telling riders the route temporarily was out of
operation. It normally runs at intervals of 10-20 minutes from
about 6 a.m. to midnight.
   Taxis, hit by the government's strict limit of about 7 gallons
of gas per car per month, were difficult to find.
   But the city's extensive system of trolleybuses continued to
operate on schedule.
   Alla Gecauniene, a middle-aged railroad worker selling her
daffodils and carnations on a street corner for extra money, said
residents of her village of Lentvis 11 miles from Vilnius were
having a hard time getting into the capital.
   Instead of a bus every hour on Sunday, there was only one bus to
the capital and one back, she said.
   The Russians, Poles and Lithuanians living in her village of
about 4,000 were still getting along, and there were no plans so
far to shut down the main industry, a sewing factory, she said.
   Despite the heightened political tension, the ethnic Lithuanian
woman said she really didn't know what all the fuss was about.
   Whatever government is running the republic must fill the store
shelves better, she said.
   ``We produce stockings in Lithuania, soap and shampoo,'' she
said. ``Where are they?''
   ``I'm not involved in politics,'' she added. ``I just want full
stores so I can buy what I want.''

<TEXT>
   A bipartisan band of past and current
congressional challengers called Monday for a political
housecleaning to end the ``imperial, permanent Congress.''
   ``Our federally elected officials have so rigged the process
that they are impossible to unseat,'' said Harold Coker, a
Chattanooga, Tenn., Republican who ran unsuccessfully for Congress
in 1988.
   His complaint was the central theme at a meeting of the
Coalition to End the Permanent Congress, a grassroots organization
formed in protest of the 1988 elections, in which 98.5 percent of
House incumbents seeking re-election were successful.
   Coker was one of about three dozen congressional candidates,
some seeking office this year and others having lost earlier
contests, to attend the meeting.
   The coalition members, representing at least 18 states,
advocated a lengthy list of reform proposals. Among them were a ban
on taxpayer-paid mass mailings by members of Congress; prohibiting
lawmakers from accepting honoraria or speaking fees; eliminating
political action committees, which contribute mostly to campaigns
of incumbents; and imposing a 12-year limit on how long members can
serve in the House and the Senate.
   The coalition's assault on incumbency came as the Senate
prepared to consider legislation to overhaul the system of
financing congressional campaigns. Lionel Kunst, a Kansas Democrat
who helped found the coalition, rejected the legislation as
``pablum'' and said it would do little for challengers.
   The coalition did approve of one proposal that could surface in
the Senate debate, however. Group members embraced the idea of
providing free television time to incumbents and challengers. A
Senate leadership task force has suggested giving political parties
free TV time to divide among candidates.
   Although the desire to win election to Congress brought the
group together, its members maintained they had a much loftier goal
of reviving government.
   ``I'm here because Congress is not doing the job. They're not
solving the problems of America,'' complained Coker.
   Bernard Tomkin, an Elkins Park, Pa., Democrat who is running
again after a loss in 1988, put it this way: ``Unless we find a way
to clean up and ventilate our political process, then we are
letting our future generation down.''

   The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy was carried to his
crypt Monday on a wave of praise, riding in a plain mule-drawn
wooden wagon flanked by his sons and colleagues in the civil rights
movement.
   The procession followed a service at which civil rights leaders
who criticized Abernathy for his controversial account of Martin
Luther King Jr. got a public rebuke.
   The famous and the humble piled shoulder-to-shoulder inside a
southwest Atlanta church for the four-hour service for the man who
was King's longtime chief lieutenant in the civil rights movement.
   Afterward, two mules, pulling a green wooden wagon bearing
Abernathy's casket, set out from West Hunter Street Baptist Church,
where Abernathy was pastor, for Lincoln Cemetery.
   King's body was carried to its resting place by a mule-drawn
wagon after he was assassinated in 1968 at the suggestion of
Abernathy, who considered it symbolic of humility. Relatives said
Abernathy wanted the same for himself.
   Abernathy's bier traveled in a two-hour procession of 22
limousines that passed dilapidated buildings and drug-nfested
communities along the street named in honor of King.
   Groups of people, some with children and pets, lined sidewalks
as the wagon inched along in a sea of 150 suited marchers,
including Abernathy's sons, Kwame and state Rep. Ralph David
Abernathy III, and movement associates Andrew Young and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson.
   Among those speaking at the funeral was Georgia state Rep.
Tyrone Brooks, who said said the civil rights movement should be
proud instead of embarrassed by Abernathy's book, ``The Walls Came
Tumbling Down.'' The autobiography, published last year, touched on
King's alleged extramarital affairs.
   Brooks, who was a student activist in the 1960s, stood in the
pulpit above Abernathy's rose-covered coffin and waved a copy of
the book. He urged the crowd of 2,500 to read it.
   ``It was not a mistake,'' Brooks said. ``It is the truth. All
636 pages.''
   Among those present were King's widow, Coretta Scott King, and
three of her children; King's sister, Christine King Farris;
Benjamin Hooks, head of the NAACP; U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.;
Robert Kennedy Jr.; Archbishop Eugene Marino; and Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   Abernathy, who was King's closest friend and adviser, died April
17 of a heart attack induced by a blood clot. He was 64.
   Jackson said Abernathy's accomplishments through the civil
rights movement far outshadow any disagreement brought by his
memoirs.
   ``One cannot judge a player by one exceptional play,'' Jackson
said. ``Nor can a player be judged by an error. Ralph Abernathy is
in the hall of fame. We must pay homage and thanks.''
   Hugh Gloster, president emeritus of Morehouse College, King's
alma mater, described Abernathy as ``second only to Martin Luther
King as a leader in the civil rights movement.''
   ``You have had your share of abuse and scorn,'' Gloster said.
   Abernathy's son, Ralph David Abernathy III, compared his father
to the biblical hero David, saying he slew ``the Goliath of
racism'' and served as a stellar role model.
   ``I am the son of a giant slayer,'' he said.

   A state judge Monday ordered a
religious group to stop building fallout shelters near Yellowstone
National Park after thousands of gallons of fuel leaked from
underground storage tanks.
   The order came on the day that began what the church's spiritual
leader says is a 12-year ``dark cycle'' of global danger and
catastrophe, from which the shelters are to protect 750 followers.
   The state requested the temporary restraining order in a
petition filed Friday.
   It bars the Church Universal and Triumphant from continuing
construction on the shelter complex near Corwin Springs, where
church headquarters are located.
   District Judge Byron Robb said he signed the order in chambers
Monday and scheduled a May 3 hearing on a permanent injunction
requested by the state.
   An estimated 31,000 gallons of diesel fuel and gasoline leaked
recently from three underground storage tanks at the shelter
complex.
   Officials of the state Department of Health and Environmental
Sciences want work to stop pending an environmental review.
   The complex is surrounded by at least 35 underground tanks that
can hold 634,500 gallons of diesel, gasoline, heating oil and
antifreeze.
   Church spiritual leader Elizabeth Clare Prophet has prophesied
that planetary karma _ ``the cumulative weight of mankind's sins''
_ has been building for 25,800 years and would fully descend on
Earth as of Monday to begin a ``dark cycle'' of danger that will
last 12 years.
   In the past, Prophet said, cataclysm occurred when enough bad
karma accumulated. She said she remembers in a previous life the
continent of Lemuria ``breaking up in flames'' and sinking beneath
the Pacific Ocean.
   This time, she said, the bad karma could manifest itself in
economic collapse, nuclear war or accident, plague or massive
earthquakes.

   Former hostage Robert Polhill is
alert but tired and malnourished after 1,182 days in captivity in
Lebanon, doctors said after examining the American educator Monday
in West Germany.
   Polhill, 55, released Sunday in Beirut, was hungry when he
arrived at the hospital early Monday. He savored some scrambled
eggs and bacon and later enjoyed an afternoon nap of his first day
of freedom.
   Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists had held him since Jan. 24,
1987. He was the first U.S. hostage to be released in Lebanon in
nearly 3{ years.
   President Bush thanked Iran and Syria for their help in securing
Polhill's release.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati called for a swift
reciprocal move _ freedom for a Shiite cleric kidnapped by Israeli
troops in July.
   Velayati also said a second U.S. hostage may be released in the
near future.
   But the Bush administration repeated it would not bargain for
freedom.
   While President Bush searched for ``opportunities for further
releases'' of American hostages with phone calls to President Hafez
al-Assad of Syria and King Hussein of Jordan, U.S. officials said
no rewards, diplomatic or otherwise, would be made for granting
freedom to one American while seven remain captive.
   ``Our hostages should be released unconditionally, safely and
immediately, and this barbaric practice should end,'' Secretary of
State James A. Baker III said.
   Velayati said in an interview with Cable News Network,
``According to the latest information that we have received from
Lebanon, maybe after a few days another hostage will be released.''
   He did not specify the hostage's nationality.
   Hussein Musawi, a leading pro-Iranian Shiite cleric, also said
one of the 17 remaining Western hostages may be freed soon. Musawi
is thought to have influence over Islamic Jihad for the Liberation
of Palestine, the group that held Polhill.
   Polhill, of New York, an assistant professor of business studies
at Beirut University College, was kidnapped from the campus on Jan.
24, 1987, by gunmen posing as policemen. Alann Steen, 51, of
Boston, a communications instructor, and Jesse Turner, 42, of
Boise, Idaho, a professor of mathematics and computer science, were
kidnapped with him and remain hostages.
   In Tehran, Iran's state radio also said Polhill's release may be
a prelude to the release of other hostages. It said Washington and
other Western governments ``must show goodwill.''
   U.S. officials said they had no information of another pending
release.
   Polhill first went to Syria, where his Lebanese wife, Feryal,
met him. They then were flown in a U.S. C-141 military transport
plane to West Germany.
   ``Welcome home, pray for the others,'' read a banner that
greeted Polhill in Wiesbaden, a traditional stop for newly freed
U.S. hostages before going home.
   Military spokesman Cmdr. John Woodhouse said Polhill's stay at
the U.S. Air Force hospital could last ``a couple of days to a few
weeks.'' Polhill would decide.
   U.S. officials told reporters Polhill spoke on the phone to Bush
and Baker.
   ``We're not aware of any message for Bush,'' one official said.
   When the kidnappers announced an imminent release last week,
they said the freed captive would carry a message for Bush.
   A statement released after Polhill spent two hours in the
hospital said, ``He is alert, stable, ambulatory and somewhat
tired. Although he appears to be in relatively good shape, he is
malnourished and mildly dehydrated.''
   The statement said doctors also would evaluate Polhill's
diabetes, a condition he has had for 25 years.
   The freed hostage is staying in VIP quarters, in a suite with
hotel-like accommodations.
   Polhill walked unaided into the hospital. Two airmen had
steadied him as he got off the plane and boarded a helicopter. He
clutched a gift football under his arm as he walked slowly down the
plane's stairs, greeted by cheers and applause from about 100
people.
   He wore an Air Force squadron cap and a poncho to protect him
from a steady rain.
   Polhill's two sons, Stephen, 26, and Brian, 23, were expected to
arrive Tuesday from the United States.
   The U.S. officials said Polhill was kept in the same building as
Turner and Steen, but ``he probably doesn't know about Terry
Anderson or Terry Waite.''
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest held Western hostage. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985. Most of the others have been missing at least three years.
   Waite, 50, British envoy of the Anglican Church, disappeared in
Lebanon on Jan. 20, 1987, while trying to negotiate the release of
Western hostages.
   The last U.S. hostage to be freed was David Jacobsen, former
director of the American University Hospital in Beirut. He was
kidnapped May 28, 1985, and released Nov. 2, 1986. He was held by
another Shiite faction, Islamic Jihad, or Holy War.
   Velayati said in New York that Iran and the Shiite movements in
Lebanon wanted a prompt reciprocal gesture: the release of Sheik
Abdul Karim Obeid, a Lebanese Shiite clergyman abducted by Israeli
soldiers in July.
   On Monday, Israel welcomed Polhill's release but made no mention
of releasing Obeid.
   Bush said, ``I want all of those hostages out _ we're not going
to trade.''
   He thanked Iran and Syria for efforts leading to Polhill's
freedom.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the United
States made no concessions to Polhill's abductors.
   On Monday, the Tehran Times, a paper close to Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, called for release of another U.S. hostage.
   Musawi told the Communist-run Voice of the People radio in
Lebanon: ``The possibility of another release is in the cards, but
I don't know when, how or for what.''
   The cleric heads Islamic Amal, a faction within Hezbollah, or
Party of God, believed to be an umbrella for groups holding most of
the remaining Western hostages. The last Westerns abducted in a
group that includes Britons, an Italian and West Germans, were two
Swiss Red Cross workers, taken Oct. 16.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi called Sunday for releasing all
hostages in an appeal to Moslems around the world, the official
Libyan news agency JANA said in a dispatch.
   Polhill told a Syrian TV interviewer he played cards with other
hostages during his captivity and tried to keep his mind off the
possibility of freedom.
   Before leaving for West Germany, Polhill said his joy was
tempered by the knowledge that seven Americans were still held.
   He said he ``was angry at what was being done to me, being taken
away from my wife and family,'' and that during his long
confinement he ``strived to continue being angry, knowing at all
times that if I began to lose that anger I'd just sort of become a
vegetable.''
   The government-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported from
Damascus that Bush, Baker and Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole,
R-Kansas, telephoned to thank Syrian leaders for their help in
gaining Polhill's freedom.
   ``President Bush said nothing would have been accomplished
without Syria,'' it added.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudan's military ruler said loyalist
forces thwarted a coup attempt by army officers Monday, arrested
those involved and quickly restored peace to this East African
nation.
   Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir, the country's military leader,
said the coup attempt was led by active and retired military
officers. It was the second reported attempt in a month to
overthrow the ruling junta.
   ``All those involved in the attempt have been arrested,''
el-Bashir said in a speech broadcast at midday over official Radio
Omduran.
   A government spokesman said most of the rebels surrendered
without a fight and there were no casualties. Sources in Khartoum
said one soldier was slightly wounded in a brief shootout.
   El-Bashir said the coup was easily suppressed because the coup's
plotters had been under surveillance by authorities from the start
of the takeover attempt.
   Informed sources in the capital, Khartoum, said the army
appeared to have had little trouble putting down a series of
attacks by junior army officers.
   Government spokesman Mohammed Khogali Salihein said authorities
had previously arrested 30 officers involved in a March coup
attempt and later received information that a second group of
officers were planning Monday's coup.
   He said the government ``took measures to prevent the move from
the start'' and was able to convince the rebels to surrender
without a fight.
   ``There was no fighting and consequently no casualties,''
Salihein said.
   He said the coup's two leaders, retired Maj. Gen Abdul-Kadir
al-Kadaru and retired Brig. Mohammed Osman Hamid Karrar, gave
themselves up after they were assured they would stand a fair trial.
   El-Bashir said the abortive coup was plotted by ``the alliance
in coalition with the outlaws.'' He did not elaborate.
   ``The alliance'' was possibly a reference to political parties
disbanded by el-Bashir after his junta took control of the country
on June 30.
   The government has often used the term ``outlaws'' to refer to
the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, which has been waging a
seven-year insurgency seeking autonomy and greater economic reforms
for the country's three southern provinces.
   Sudanese sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
attempted coup began at midnight and the rebels tried to take over
Khartoum airport and the official government radio. They were
quickly overcome.
   ``They tried to take over the airport and the radio in a rather
pathetic way and were very unsuccessful,'' one source said.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said several
rebel officers also tried to shoot their way into the downtown
headquarters of the armed forces general command, apparently in
search of el-Bashir. They were unable to get through the front gate.
   One guard at the general command was reportedly wounded in the
hand, sources said.
   Khartoum airport was closed briefly and telecommunications were
cut for several hours. By midmorning, Khartoum was peaceful.
   In the capital, troops supported by tanks guarded bridges and
the military's general command. The army was reportedly on full
alert, but there seemed to be no special security precautions on
the streets of the Khartoum.
   El-Bashir came to power in June after he overthrew Prime
Minister Sadek el-Mahdi's civilian government. El-Bashir has said
his principal aims are to end the rebel insurgency in the south and
improve the country's faltering economy.
   He has had little success.

   A 19-car Amtrak passenger train derailed
Monday, injuring at least 83 of the 400 people aboard, authorities
said.
   Seven cars of the eastbound California Zephyr derailed about
1:25 p.m. on Burlington Northern tracks, authorities said.
Eyewitnesses counted as many as nine cars off the track.
   ``It made a hell of a noise and then all kind of dust started
flying,'' said Robert Franklin of Batavia.
   ``It was just one big, loud bang. Kind of like a clankety,
clang,'' said his wife, Patricia.
   The train was carrying 394 passengers and about 20 crew members,
said Debbie Hare, an Amtrak spokeswoman in Chicago.
   Area hospitals reported receiving at least 83 people from the
accident, 10 of whom were hurt seriously enough to be admitted.
   Iowa State Patrol Lt. Ronald Moon said there were no known
deaths.
   The cars began to run off the track just before it reached a
crossing on the southern edge of this town of 525 residents, 90
miles southeast of Des Moines.
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board and
Burlington Northern were dispatched to the scene.
   The train had 12 passenger cars, four baggage cars and three
locomotives, said Sue Martin, an Amtrak spokeswoman in Washington.
   Marci Larson, another Amtrak spokeswoman in Washington, said the
last seven cars derailed: three remained upright, three were left
leaning and one, a sleeper car, was turned on its side.
   Amtrak officials said they did not know how fast the train was
traveling when the cars left the tracks and that the train's
``black box'' would have to be examined. The train is authorized to
travel as fast as 79 mph in the area, they said.
   Among the passengers was Wisconsin State Rep. Marlin Schneider,
who was returning from the National Conference of State
Legislatures in Boise, Idaho, and suffered a bruise to his leg.
   ``We were having lunch and suddenly the train came apart,'' said
Schneider, who was traveling with his two young daughters.
   ``It started to buckle. Cars are off the tracks everywhere. ...
We didn't get hurt very badly but a number of people did.''
   Schneider said it was fortunate he and his daughters were in the
dining car and not in their sleeping car, which tipped over.
   Uninjured passengers were taken to a community center about two
blocks away from the crash.
   ``The train just started shaking,'' Jasonna Gibson of
Schenectady, N.Y. said. She said she was holding her baby, Tamu,
when the train derailed.
   ``The baby fell. I tried to get him and a lady fell on me,'' Ms.
Gibson said.
   Paula Stater, whose lives about a quarter mile from where the
train derailed, said she saw it topple from the tracks.
   ``It just went over,'' she said. ``It just made a sound, like
metal grating metal. It was really unusual, like a bunch of wheels
hitting.''
   Paul Tray, 29, of Batavia, said workers were using a ladder to
climb down into the tipped-over cars, searching for people who
might be in the wreckage.
   Ms. Martin said the train had been running two hours late
because the Oakland section had to detour between Oakland and
Sacrameto due to a gasoline spill on or near the tracks.
   Amtrak was busing passengers to Chicago to continue their trip.
   Sections of the California Zephyr originate in Seattle, Los
Angeles and Oakland, Calif., and are linked in Salt Lake City for
the trip to Chicago, Hare said.
   On Oct. 12, 1987, two locomotives and 11 of 14 passenger cars of
the California Zephyr collided with maintenance equipment on a side
track near the town of Russell, injuring 122 people. That crash was
55 miles west of Monday's derailment.
   Also Monday, crews in western Pennsylvania skimmed crude oil
from the surface of a creek that was fouled when a freight train
derailed and caught fire. Twenty-nine cars in a 97-car Buffalo and
Pittsburgh Railroad Inc. train derailed in Craigsville, Pa., on
Sunday night. No serious injuries were reported in the ensuing
explosion and fire.

   Former hostage Robert Polhill is
alert but tired and malnourished after 39 months in captivity in
Lebanon, doctors said after examining the American educator Monday
in West Germany.
   Polhill, 55, released Sunday in Beirut, was hungry when he
arrived at the hospital early Monday. He savored some scrambled
eggs and bacon and later enjoyed an afternoon nap of his first day
of freedom.
   Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists had held 1,182 days, since
Jan. 24, 1987. He was the first U.S. hostage to be released in
Lebanon in nearly 3{ years.
   President Bush thanked Syria for its help in securing Polhill's
release.
   Iran said was reported to have helped, and Iranian Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati called for a swift reciprocal move _
freedom for a Shiite cleric kidnapped by Israeli troops in July.
   Velayati also said a second U.S. hostage may be released in the
near future.
   But the Bush administration repeated it would not bargain for
freedom.
   While President Bush searched for ``opportunities for further
releases'' of American hostages with phone calls to President Hafez
al-Assad of Syria and King Hussein of Jordan, U.S. officials said
no rewards, diplomatic or otherwise, would be made for granting
freedom to one American while seven remain captive.
   ``Our hostages should be released unconditionally, safely and
immediately, and this barbaric practice should end,'' Secretary of
State James A. Baker III said.
   Velayati said in an interview with Cable News Network,
``According to the latest information that we have received from
Lebanon, maybe after a few days another hostage will be released.''
   He did not specify the hostage's nationality.
   Hussein Musawi, a leading pro-Iranian Shiite cleric, also said
one of the 17 remaining Western hostages may be freed soon. Musawi
is thought to have influence over Islamic Jihad for the Liberation
of Palestine, the group that held Polhill.
   Polhill, of New York, an assistant professor of business studies
at Beirut University College, was kidnapped from the campus on Jan.
24, 1987, by gunmen posing as policemen. Alann Steen, 51, of
Boston, a communications instructor, and Jesse Turner, 42, of
Boise, Idaho, a professor of mathematics and computer science, were
kidnapped with him and remain hostages.
   In Tehran, Iran's state radio also said Polhill's release may be
a prelude to the release of other hostages. It said Washington and
other Western governments ``must show goodwill.''
   U.S. officials said they had no information of another pending
release.
   Polhill first went to Syria, where his Lebanese wife, Feryal,
met him. They then were flown in a U.S. C-141 military transport
plane to West Germany.
   ``Welcome home, pray for the others,'' read a banner that
greeted Polhill in Wiesbaden, a traditional stop for newly freed
U.S. hostages before going home.
   Military spokesman Cmdr. John Woodhouse said Polhill's stay at
the U.S. Air Force hospital could last ``a couple of days to a few
weeks.'' Polhill would decide.
   U.S. officials told reporters Polhill spoke on the phone to Bush
and Baker.
   ``We're not aware of any message for Bush,'' one official said.
   When the kidnappers announced an imminent release last week,
they said the freed captive would carry a message for Bush.
   A statement released after Polhill spent two hours in the
hospital said, ``He is alert, stable, ambulatory and somewhat
tired. Although he appears to be in relatively good shape, he is
malnourished and mildly dehydrated.''
   The statement said doctors also would evaluate Polhill's
diabetes, a condition he has had for 25 years.
   The freed hostage is staying in VIP quarters, in a suite with
hotel-like accommodations.
   Polhill walked unaided into the hospital. Two airmen had
steadied him as he got off the plane and boarded a helicopter. He
clutched a gift football under his arm as he walked slowly down the
plane's stairs, greeted by cheers and applause from about 100
people.
   He wore an Air Force squadron cap and a poncho to protect him
from a steady rain.
   Polhill's two sons, Stephen, 26, and Brian, 23, were expected to
arrive Tuesday from the United States.
   The U.S. officials said Polhill was kept in the same building as
Turner and Steen, but ``he probably doesn't know about Terry
Anderson or Terry Waite.''
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest held Western hostage. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985. Most of the others have been missing at least three years.
   Waite, 50, British envoy of the Anglican Church, disappeared in
Lebanon on Jan. 20, 1987, while trying to negotiate the release of
Western hostages.
   The last U.S. hostage to be freed was David Jacobsen, former
director of the American University Hospital in Beirut. He was
kidnapped May 28, 1985, and released Nov. 2, 1986. He was held by
another Shiite faction, Islamic Jihad, or Holy War.
   Velayati said in New York that Iran and the Shiite movements in
Lebanon wanted a prompt reciprocal gesture: the release of Sheik
Abdul Karim Obeid, a Lebanese Shiite clergyman abducted by Israeli
soldiers in July.
   On Monday, Israel welcomed Polhill's release but made no mention
of releasing Obeid.
   Bush said, ``I want all of those hostages out _ we're not going
to trade.''
   He thanked Syria for efforts leading to Polhill's freedom.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the United
States made no concessions to Polhill's abductors.
   On Monday, the Tehran Times, a paper close to Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, called for release of another U.S. hostage.
   Musawi told the Communist-run Voice of the People radio in
Lebanon: ``The possibility of another release is in the cards, but
I don't know when, how or for what.''
   The cleric heads Islamic Amal, a faction within Hezbollah, or
Party of God, believed to be an umbrella for groups holding most of
the remaining Western hostages. The last Westerns abducted in a
group that includes Britons, an Italian and West Germans, were two
Swiss Red Cross workers, taken Oct. 16.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi called Sunday for releasing all
hostages in an appeal to Moslems around the world, the official
Libyan news agency JANA said in a dispatch.
   Polhill told a Syrian TV interviewer he played cards with other
hostages during his captivity and tried to keep his mind off the
possibility of freedom.
   Before leaving for West Germany, Polhill said his joy was
tempered by the knowledge that seven Americans were still held.
   He said he ``was angry at what was being done to me, being taken
away from my wife and family,'' and that during his long
confinement he ``strived to continue being angry, knowing at all

   The government-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported from
Damascus that Bush, Baker and Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole,

gaining Polhill's freedom.
   ``President Bush said nothing would have been accomplished

   A French police official on Monday identified 26
paintings that had been seized in France as works purchased by
Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi from former Philippines first lady
Imelda Marcos.
   Prosecutors claim the paintings, as well as four Manhattan
buildings, were bought by Mrs. Marcos and her late husband,
Ferdinand E., with funds allegedly embezzled from their homeland's
treasury.
   Khashoggi, a co-defendant, is accused of forging documents to
help the Marcoses conceal their ownership of the paintings and real
estate in violation of a U.S. court order freezing any transactions
involving Marcos-owned properties.
   But Khashoggi's attorneys say his dealings with the Marcoses
occurred before the March 1986 injunction, just after they fled the
Philippines for exile in Hawaii.
   An art expert testified that the 26 paintings Khashoggi bought
from Marcos had a much lower market value in 1986 than the $6.5
million he paid for the entire group of 38 ``old master''
paintings. The paintings weren't identified in court.
   Ian Glenn Kennedy, a senior vice president at Christie's auction
house, testified that an appraisal of the 26 paintings showed their
combined value four years ago would have ranged from $1.7 million
to $2.7 million.
   Ealier in the day, Christian Rene LeBeau, an officer with the
French Judicial Police's art theft unit, identified 26 paintings
that had been seized in 1987 in Paris and Cannes. He did so from
photographs of the paintings supplied by prosecutors.
   Testifying through a translator, LeBeau said he was in charge of
the search for the paintings after U.S. authorities asked France
for help.
   He was called to the stand after the testimony Friday of
Jean-Paul Renard, an investigating magistrate from Cannes, France,
and Fernand DeZacharia, a French-English translator who had been
present when Khashoggi appeared twice before Renard in 1987.
   English translations of those two interviews, entered into
evidence during DeZacharia's testimony, contain Khashoggi saying
that his decision to buy the paintings was made in 1985 and that
payment of $6.5 million followed in two installments in March and
May of 1986.
   Under cross-examination, LeBeau was asked by lawyers for both
Khashoggi and Mrs. Marcos whether their clients ever had been
charged in France with trafficking in stolen art.
   When LeBeau said he could not answer the questions, U.S.
District Judge John F. Keenan told jurors that the information had
as much to do with this case ``as the man in the moon.''
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, has pleaded innocent to charges of
racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction
of justice. Her husband, who also was charged in the 1988
indictment, died in September in exile in Hawaii.
   Khashoggi is charged with obstruction of justice and mail fraud.

<HEAD>Two Arabs Die After Clashes, Palestinians Defy Uprising Strike</HEAD>

   Two Palestinians died Monday of gunshot wounds
suffered in an earlier clash with troops, and merchants in Arab
east Jerusalem defied strike orders in a growing rebellion against
the uprising's pro-PLO leadership.
   Also Sunday, Likud hard-liners attacked caretaker Prime Minister
and Likud bloc leader Yitzhak Shamir for promising to pursue a
government peace initiative in order to win the support of a small
religious party.
   The two Arabs were shot in the head by soldiers dispersing
stone-throwers Sunday and died of their wounds early Monday,
Palestinian reports said.
   An army spokesman confirmed the deaths and said the
circumstances were under investigation.
   Arab hospital officials identified the slain youth as Moussa
Mohammed Husseini al Alameh, 14, and Yousef Atta Al Kishawi, 10.
Israeli authorities said Kishawi was 13.
   The deaths brought to 676 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers and civilians in the 28-month-old uprising against
Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Since the start of the uprising, another 208 Palestinians have
been killed by fellow Arabs, mostly on suspicion of cooperating
with Israel. Forty-three Israelis have also died.
   In east Jerusalem, merchants opened their shops today after
Palestinian activists canceled strike orders by the pro-PLO Unified
National Leadership of the Uprising.
   The leadership had called a strike on Sunday to show
Christian-Moslem solidarity after Jews moved into a settlement in
the Christian quarter of Jerusalem's Old City. A second day of
strikes was called for Monday in support of so-called ``liberated''
villages.
   The two-day strike order, contained in the latest Unified
Leadership leaflet, has angered many Moslem Palestinians because it
comes in the middle of the shopping period before the three-day Id
al-Fitr holiday later this week.
   Moslems exchange gifts and prepare festive meals to celebrate Id
al-Fitr that marks the end of the month-long Ramadan fast.
   Both strike days were canceled by local uprising activists in
the West Bank's largest town, Nablus.
   It was reportedly the first time that leaders in Nablus, a
hotbed of Palestinian nationalism, have rejected orders from the
leadership.
   Likud hard-liners attacked Shamir after he promised to pursue a
government peace initiative to win the support of the five-member
ultra-Orthodox Shas Party.
   Shas' support leaves Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc in a
deadlock with the left-leaning Labor Party. Both parties now have
the support of 60 of Parliament's 120 members as they vie to form a
new coalition government.
   ``Who authorized you to commit the Likud to continue with the
peace process?'' asked former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, a
champion of the party's far-right faction.
   Shamir promised Shas the government would pursue its peace
initiative that promises Palestinian elections in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip. He also agreed to accept a preliminary meeting
between Israelis and Palestinians to discuss details of the
elections.
   The move comes as Labor is frantically trying to patch together
a coalition to present to Parliament. The left-leaning party was
chosen by President Chaim Herzog to put together a new government
and has until Thursday to present their coalition.
   Also Monday, Minister of Immigration and Absorption Yitzhak
Peretz said that 28,740 immigrants arrived in Israel this year,
including nearly 25,000 immigrants from the Soviet Union, Israel
radio reported.
   Israeli officials expect hundred of thousands of Soviet
immigrants over the next few years.

   Firefighters worked Monday to extinguish
three burning train cars and crews skimmed crude oil from the
surface of a creek that was fouled when a freight train derailed
and caught fire.
   Twenty-nine cars in a 97-car Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad
Inc. train derailed in this sparsely populated rural community
Sunday night. No serious injuries were reported in the ensuing
explosion and fire.
   About 100,000 gallons of oil leaked from four cars and up to
10,000 gallons of sodium hydroxide, a caustic chemical used to
clean drains, leaked from one car, said John Bell, the railroad's
vice president and general manager.
   Heat from two coal cars that caught fire Sunday night warmed six
derailed oil tankers to dangerously high temperatures, officials
said. Three oil tankers that had collided burned intermittently,
officials said.
   To ease the heat, one of the two coal cars was moved late Monday
afternoon to a field about 150 yards away from the track, Bell
said. Smoldering coal was spread over the ground and sprayed with a
special water solution to cool it.
   Crews began moving the second car early in the evening,
officials said.
   ``The situation at present is unstable. There are still isolated
fires flaring up on occasion,'' said Lt. Gov. Mark Singel, who
visited the scene.
   Firefighters sprayed the oil cars with water to cool them, said
Bob Walker, hazardous materials coordinator for Armstrong County's
emergency management agency.
   Most of the leaks in the tanker cars were plugged by afternoon,
Bell said.
   About 200 people had been evacuated late Sunday, but most were
allowed to return home Monday. An evacuation order remained in
effect for about 50 people who lived within a quarter-mile of the
accident because of the possibility of an explosion, Bell said.
   Although some oil spilled into Buffalo Creek, most of it burned
off in the fire, Bell said.The creek flows into the Allegheny
River, the source of drinking water for several Pittsburgh-area
communities.
   The spill was expected to have no significant impact on drinking
water supplies, said Charles Duritsa, a regional director for the
state Department of Environmental Resources.
   ``The environmental impact was pretty much controlled by teams
diking the accident site,'' Duritsa said.
   Authorities were investigating the cause of the crash, Bell said.
   Several of the derailed cars lay in a zigzag pattern, and white
smoke poured from burning coal cars Monday afternoon. Fire
smoldered in a stream of oil that flowed from one car into a ravine.
   Firefighters used hoses to suck oil and sodium hydroxide from
the ground. Booms set up along Buffalo Creek skimmed globs of oil
from the surface of the water.
   A car that had contained 18,000 to 20,000 gallons of sodium
hydroxide had been turned upright. About half of the chemical
leaked from an inspection pipe atop the car when it was flipped
upside down in the derailment.
   The two conductors, who were not injured, were given drug and
alcohol tests, as is routine after accidents, Bell said. They told
the railroad they were traveling about 20 mph when the derailment
occurred, Bell said. The company speed limit for the Craigsville
area is 25 mph.
   Thousands of dead fish were found in Buffalo Creek, a popular
fishing spot, said Emil Svetahor, an official with the state Fish
Commission. The commission had planned to stock the creek with more
fish Friday, but those plans have been canceled, Svetahor said.
   Don and Louise Butler, who live in a mobile home about a block
from the crash, were in their living room when the train passed by.
   ``It was the fastest train I've ever heard go through here,''
Butler said.
   After the explosion the Butlers ran outside in their
nightclothes and drove to a hilltop about two miles away. Even at
that distance they felt the heat of the fire, they said.
   Bell said there was no indication the train was speeding.

   A three-story building collapsed during
rehabilitation work Monday, injuring three people.
   The collapse damaged gas lines in the building and triggered a
gas leak, but there was no fire or explosion, said Ed Joyce,
spokesman for Peoples Gas, Light &amp; Coke Co.
   Firefighters spent the afternoon and evening searching for two
people at first thought to be in the rubble of the brick commercial
and residential building on the city's west side, which collased at
4:30 p.m. But the search was called off at 7:30 p.m. after the
missing were accounted for, said a fire department spokesman.
   Two of the injured were taken to Cook County Hospital, where
one, a woman, was in stable but guarded condition. The other, a
man, was still in the emergency room and his condition had not been
determined early Monday evening, a hospital spokesman said. Their
names were withheld.
   A third victim, Norman Graham, 65, was in fair condition at
Northwestern Memorial Hospital with multiple bruises and was
expected to be discharged Monday night, a hospital spokesman said.
   ``We understand a contractor was in that building doing some
rehab work and apparently removed one of the main support beams,''
Joyce said.
   The three-story building housed two stores on the ground floor
and four to six apartments above, Joyce said.

   A private human rights monitoring group
appealed to Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu on Monday to
spare an accused Chinese hijacker from probable torture in China
and let him be tried in Japan.
   Extraditing Zhang Zhenhai to China ``would be a serious human
rights violation,'' because he would ``likely be tortured by
Chinese authorities both for participation in the democracy
movement and for his hijacking'' of a Chinese airliner last
December, Asia Watch said in a message to Kaifu.
   Asia Watch appealed to Kaifu on the basis of a Tokyo report that
Zhang could be deported to China this week. Justice Minister Shin
Hasegawa issued an order for his extradition Monday.
   ``We obviously do not condone hijacking, but no one should be
subjected to torture,'' said the signer of the appeal, Asia Watch
executive director Sidney Jones.
   Asia Watch is affiliated with Helsinki Watch, which oversees
human rights guidelines of the 1975 Helsinki agreement on East-West
cooperation and security.
   Asia Watch has documented several cases of torture in Chinese
prisons, including many participants in the crushed 1989 democracy
movement, Ms. Jones said.
   The Tokyo High Court last week upheld the Japanese government's
intention to deny political asylum to Zhang, overruling his defense
that his offense was political.
   Zhang, now 36, had actively participated in the 1979 Democracy
Wall movement and in the 1989 demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen
square, his lawyers said.
   Police said he hijacked a Chinese jumbo jet en route from
Beijing to New York with 233 people aboard, threatening to blow it
up with a bomb he did not actually have. The plane landed at
Fukuoka, Japan, and Zhang's wife and 13-year-old son were returned
to China the next day.
   Japanese prosecutors said Zhang was not involved in political
activity and was seeking to flee criminal charges described by
Chinese television as embezzlement.
   In another development, two members of the House of
Representatives launched a Republican launched a campaign for
colleagues in Congress to ``adopt'' some of the perhaps 30,000
people they said are in Chinese prisons for backing the democracy
movement crushed last year.
   ``We want the Beijing government to know that we have not
forgotten _ and will not forget _ the courageous men and women who
risked their lives in the struggle for democratic reform,'' Reps.
Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., and John Miller, R-Wash., said in a letter to
House members.
   They asked colleagues to write letters to Chinese authorities in
behalf of individual ``adoptees,'' to insert statements in the
daily Congressional Record on their behalf and to bring up their
names when travelling in China.

<HEAD>Troubled Musical `King' Opens in London to Ovation, Poor Reviews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``King,'' the troubled London musical about Martin
Luther King Jr., opened Monday to a four-minute standing ovation
but poor reviews from the critics.
   ``Someone should put on a musical about the making of `King.' It
would probably turn out to be a good deal more entertaining than
`King' itself,'' Charles Spencer in The Daily Telegraph wrote. The
show bowed at the Piccadilly Theater after its original opening
date, April 4, was postponed three times.
   Maureen Paton in The Daily Express wrote: ``This treatment comes
across as a simplified version for children. It may be
well-meaning, but it's an insult to adults.''
   The show stars opera singers Simon Estes and Cynthia Haymon.
Their strong singing deflected doubts about the absence of any
insight into the private lives behind the public persona of the
slain black civil rights leader and his wife, Coretta.
   Monday's premier brought to an end weeks of speculation about
the show, which for several weeks was making headlines almost daily
as various directors and writers parted company with the project.
   On March 6, Coretta Scott King announced in a statement that she
was withdrawing her support because the show trivialized her
husband. She restored her support a week into previews.
   The poet and lyricist Maya Angelou, who withdrew at the same
time as Mrs. King, has yet to lend her support anew.
   The finished product bears lyrics by both Angelou and Alistair
Beaton, the Briton who co-wrote the 1988 London flop ``Ziegfeld.''
   The director, 39-year-old Clarke Peters, is a black American
based in London who has the supporting role in the show as the
garage mechanic, George. He was hired after Gotz Friedrich and
Graham Vick, two directors known for their work in opera, quit the
musical.
   The book is billed as an ``adaptation'' by Lonne Elder III, an
Oscar nominee for the film ``Sounder,'' who followed fellow
playwrights Ron Milner and Richard Nelson, neither of whom receives
credit in the program. The sheer quantity of creative participants
must account, in part, for the confused narrative and
characterization of ``King.''
   Spencer wrote in The Daily Telegraph: ``It is sometimes hard to
make out exactly what is going on, still less where or when.''
   ``King'' is budgeted at $4.5 million and breaks even at ``close
to 50 percent'' in the 1,168-seat theater, according to producer
Hans Flury.
   The top ticket price of $41 puts ``King'' on financial par with
London's reigning musical blockbusters, ``Miss Saigon'' and ``The
Phantom of the Opera.''
   Of the advance sale, executive producer Peter Wilson would say
only that it is ``very satisfying.''
   There was a standing ovation that lasted four minutes following
the opening.

   Christian shrines in the Holy Land will close
Friday and ring a funeral toll from their belltowers to protest a
government-funded Jewish settlement in the Old City's Christian
quarter, church leaders said.
   The announcement came one day after the Israeli government
confirmed it put up $1.8 million to help finance the settlement of
150 Jews in a 72-room complex near the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
called the settler move into the Christian quarter ``an insensitive
and provocative action.''
   She said Israel's funding of the settlement ``is deeply
disturbing'' and that U.S. Ambassador William Brown was raising the
issue with Israeli officials.
   In response, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yossi Amihud said:
``Jerusalem is the sovereign capital of the state of Israel and the
government of Israel will continue to stand by the rights of Jews
to settle in Jerusalem.''
   In Athens, Foreign Minister Antonis Samaras summoned Israel's
diplomatic representative, Moshe Gilboa, to protest the settlement,
government spokesman Vyron Polydoras said. The settlement is in a
compound owned by the Greek Orthodox Church.
   Archbishop Serapheim, head of the Greek Orthodox Church in
Greece, also protested Monday to Israeli caretaker Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir over the occupation.
   The settlement, set up April 11, has provoked angry
demonstrations by Christian clerics and Palestinians, both
Christian and Moslem.
   In announcing Friday's daylong protest, the leaders of 10
Christian sects in the Holy Land said government support for the
settlement ``endangers the survival of all Christian communities in
the Holy City.''
   ``We demand respect of the privileges and rights the Christians
have in the Holy Land,'' Greek Orthodox Patriarch Diodorus I said
on Monday.
   The settlement, called Neot David, is the only Jewish presence
in the Old City's Christian sector. Its spokesmen have consistently
said that no government money was involved in the settlement.
   Palestinian Christians have complained that the settlement
threatened the traditional separation of the Christian, Moslem and
Jewish quarters of the Old City.
   The Greek church, which says a former tenant illegally leased
the compound, got an court order to have the Jews evicted. The
Supreme Court will consider an appeal of the order on Thursday.
   Friday's protest will mark the first time all Christian holy
places close, said the Rt. Rev. Samir Kafiti, Anglican bishop of
Jerusalem. The church leaders included Roman Catholic, Coptic and
Lutheran officials.
   Among the Christian sites to be closed are Jerusalem's Church of
the Holy Sepulcher, Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity and the
Church of the Annunciation in Nazareth.
   Israel's Religious Affairs Ministry said in a statement that the
action ``gives rise to a suspicion that it might be an attempt to
influence the Supreme Court,'' which is hearing an appeal of an
order to evict the Jews.
   The ministry also accused church leaders of a ``basic and
serious violation of the status-quo (of holy places) that we try so
much to preserve in order to allow an orderly religious worship.''
   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek said he was sorry the churches
undertook ``drastic action'' before the legal process was completed.
   But he condemned the ``damage to coexistence in the city and the
standing of Jerusalem'' caused by the settlers. He said government
support ``only deepens the doubts and sharpens the fears of the
churches in Jerusalem.''
   The government's acknowledgement Sunday that it helped finance
the settlement was the first confirmation of official involvement
in buying Arab property in Jerusalem's walled Old City, captured by
Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
   It came as settlers prepared a new settlement in the occupied
Gaza Strip and the government authorized the expansion of
settlements in the occupied West Bank.
   The settlement activity follows the March 15 collapse of the
coalition Cabinet. That left the government in the hands of Shamir
and his right-wing Likud bloc, which favors retaining the occupied
territories.
   Shamir is leading the government on a caretaker basis while
Labor Party leader Shimon Peres tries to form a government with
ultra-Orthodox parties.
   About 75,000 Jewish settlers live in the occupied lands, home to
1.7 million Palestinians, who have a rebellion for 28 months
against Israeli rule.
   The Christian leaders said the church will hold the protest
regardless of the Supreme Court decision.
   The church closure will be in effect between 9 a.m. Friday and
an unspecified hour Saturday. Church bells will toll on the hour
from 9 a.m. until noon Friday.
   Diodorus I and Kafiti said the closure may be longer than
announced.

   U.S. Eastern Orthodox leaders have voiced their
distress at recent Jewish settlements in the Christian sector of
the Old City of Jerusalem, charging that church property was
occupied.
   They asked for a meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker
III about the ``unjustified occupation'' and ``subsequent
provocative incidents,'' church officials announced Monday.
   Telegrams about the matter were sent last week to Baker,
Jerusalem's Greek Orthodox Patriarch Diodoros and to Israel's
president Chaim Herzog.
   American Jewish leaders also criticized the settlement of 20
Jewish families in the Christian quarter of Jerusalem. The move set
off criticism in Israel as well as elsewhere.
   In Jerusalem Monday, church leaders announced that Christian
shrines in the Holy Land will close Friday and ring a funeral toll
from their belltowers to protest the settlement.
   Friday's protest will mark the first time all Christian holy
places close, said the Rt. Rev. Samir Kafiti, Anglican bishop of
Jerusalem. The church leaders announcing the plan included Roman
Catholic, Coptic and Lutheran officials.
   Among the Christian sites to be closed are Jerusalem's Church of
the Holy Sepulcher, Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity and the
Church of the Annunciation in Nazareth.
   The Standing Conference of Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the
Americas, including eight wings of Eastern Orthodoxy totaling more
than 7 million members, termed the settlements ``another obstacle''
to peace.
   In their message to Herzog, they expressed ``our distress...over
the violent occupation by Jewish settlers of property that belongs
to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem.''
   The bishops said they expected a ``prompt and just solution to
the problem by the removal of the settlers and return of this
property'' to the church.
   In Jerusalem, the Jewish families totaling about 150 members had
moved into St. John's Hospice near the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre, on Good Friday, marking the crucifixion of Christ.
   They claimed that most of the approximately $4 million spent to
sublet the property from an Armenian family that had leased it from
the Greek Orthodox Church came from unidentified American donors.
   However the Israeli government acknowledged Sunday that it had
secretly provided about $2 million to help establish a Jewish
settlement in the Christian quarter.
   Seymour D. Reich, chairman of the Conference of Major American
Jewish Organizations, said the settlement of the Jewish families
was ``offensive and an unnecessary provocation.''
   He said the action was especially disturbing since it occurred
during the celebration of Holy Week by Christians and Ramadan by
Moslems.
   Reich, who also is international president of B'nai B'rith,
noted the settlers had covered a cross over a main door with a
poster of the Star of David. He said this could be viewed as
``insensitive or even a degradation.''
   ``This was a deliberate provocation,'' he added.
   The bishops' protest was issued after a meeting April 19 of the
various national wings of U.S. Orthodoxy under chairmanship of
Greek Orthodox Archbishop Iakovos.
   They told Baker that ``difficulties in the occupied territories
and Lebanon,'' coupled with the Jewish occupation in Holy Week of
Greek Orthodox property, necessitated an early meeting with him.
   They expressed ``our painful concern over these violations'' to
Baker, and in a separate telegram to Patriarch Diodoros said:
   ``We are disheartened by the recent illegal actions that
occurred during the Passion Week of our Lord.''

   A mob-trial witness held a one-man
protest over the government's failure to protect him, marching
outside the courthouse Monday with a sign that read: ``Marked to
die by the Justice Dept.''
   James Cardinali of New York said he was dumped from the federal
Witness Protection Program after being granted him immunity in five
drug-related murders. He said the government promised to protect
him for life in return for his weeklong testimony in 1986 against
John Gotti, reputed leader of the Gambino crime family.
   ``They said they would guard me for the rest of my life,'' said
Cardinali, 40, as he paced up and down in front of the federal
courthouse downtown.
   ``If I get killed on the streets of Albuquerque _ if they have
me in a pool of blood _ that's what I deserve for trusting the
government,'' he said.
   On one side of a sandwich board draped over his shoulders was a
bull's eye and the words ``Mob Star Witness.'' On the other side:
``Marked to Die by the Justice Dept.''
   He said he would picket daily ``until there's no pavement left
here or until I'm murdered.''
   Anthony Baca, Cardinali's federal probation officer in
Albuquerque, watched the demonstration but declined to comment.
   U.S. Marshal Al Solis said he could neither confirm nor deny
Cardinali's participation in the program. He declined further
comment.
   ``They have to live up to their promises,'' Cardinali said.
``They have to take me back. If I get killed, I want everybody to
see what they do to you. The only way I can fight them is to risk
my life. They count on that so you keep your mouth shut.''
   Cardinali was arrested in 1983 for murder and made the deal for
immunity while serving in jail. After his release and entry into
the witness program, he said, ``I got myself together. I went to
church. I was doing very good.''
   Cardinali, who said he met Gotti while in prison in 1976,
testified about three murders Gotti and his co-defendants allegedly
committed. Gotti was acquitted after a seven-month trial on
racketeering and conspiracy charges.
   Cardinali said U.S. officials put him on a bus from Oklahoma
City to Albuquerque nine days ago. He said he had been living on
and off in Oklahoma since he was placed under protection in October
1988.
   ``I have no allies,'' Cardinali said. ``I know no one here. So I
have to fight this way. Once you're a stool pigeon, you don't have
no more allies.''
   Cardinali said he was released from the program in July 1989
because he breached the rules by confiding his identity to a
girlfriend.
   In January, he said, he was picked up on what he called a phony
parole violation for associating with a criminal.
   He was in prison when he agreed to wear a wire for the Justice
Department in its effort to expose an alleged conspiracy to kill a
U.S. attorney in Oklahoma, he said.
   In exchange, he said, it was promised that he would be returned
to the protection program for the rest of his life.
   Cardinali said following his release from El Reno Correction
Institute in El Reno, Okla., a week ago, the U.S. Marshals Service
failed to return him to the program.
   He said although he has received no threats since arriving in
Albuquerque, ``I'm going to be gunned down. I know it. I have great
antennae.''

   A U.S. army bus carrying 18
servicemen crashed in an accident that seriously hurt several
soldiers Monday, and police said the bus was forced off the highway
by a motorist who appeared to be intoxicated.
   The Americans' identities and the nature of their injuries were
not available. National Police spokesman Sergeant Theo Kroes said
victims were being treated at area hospitals.
   The soldiers were returning from Bremen, West Germany, to their
base in Suettendaal, Belgium. The purpose of the trip was not
reported.
   Kroes said the 34-year-old Dutch driver of a car tried to pass
the bus.
   ``The car veered left and ran into the left side of the bus,
after which both vehicles flipped several times on the shoulder,''
Kroes reported.
   He said the driver appeared to be under the influence of
alcohol, but did not say whether the motorist was hurt.
   Volunteers and rescue workers who went to the accident site,
near the Belgian and German borders, about 45 miles east of
Cologne, West Germany, said they had difficulty pulling the trapped
driver from the bus, Kroes said.

   U.S. Ambassador Anthony Quainton met with
Mario Vargas Llosa on Monday, two weeks after the novelist emerged
from first-round presidential elections with a slim victory.
   Quainton said the United States ``wants to cooperate with the

candidates'' who will take part in the runoff.
   He said he would probably meet with centrist candidate Alberto
Fujimori before the end of the week. Fujimori took 30 percent of
the April 8 vote to Vargas Llosa's 32 percent.
   Vargas Llosa held a commanding lead over eight presidential
opponents going into the final weeks of the campaign. Fujimori's
surprising late surge came largely at Vargas Llosa's expense.
   The next president will face grave problems governing bankrupt
Peru, which is suffering from hyperinflation and a rapidly
shrinking economy.
   The new president must also confront the Maoist Shining Path
guerrilla group, fighting to impose a peasant-worker state.
   The government says more than 18,000 people have died in
political violence since the Shining Path took up arms in 1980.

   Hundreds of activists clogged downtown streets
Monday to protest alleged discrimination by the insurance industry
and public health-care system for people with AIDS. The police
arrested dozens of demonstrators.
   The 1{-mile march began peacefully but turned disorderly outside
the headquarters of the American Medical Association, where a
handful of activists chanted, ``The AMA is killing us.''
   Many protesters marching in front of the Prudential Insurance
Co. shouted, ``They do nothing, we die.''
   Chanting protesters lay down in the streets and others wrote
slogans on a county building. No serious injuries were immediately
reported.
   Police said they arrested at least 70 to 100 people on charges
including disorderly conduct and mob action during the protest
organized by the Chicago chapter of ACT-UP. The nationwide group
that contends the insurance industry and public health-care system
discriminate against AIDS patients.
   ACT-UP spokesman Fred Eggan said Cook County Hospital, the sole
public hospital that treats people with acquired immune deficiency
syndrome in Chicago, only has 30 beds for AIDS patients. He said 15
remain empty because of understaffing and underfunding.
   ACT-UP also contends the insurance industry denies coverage to
some homosexuals and refuses to pay for cetain AIDS drugs.
   ``We want insurance companies to cover people with AIDS and
policies not to be canceled after (people) are diagnosed with it,''
said Jim Wagner, 26.
   In a statement released by its Newark, N.J., headquarters,
Prudential said, ``The company has been a leader in dealing with
AIDS-related illnesses.''
   The AMA said in a statement that it ``firmly agrees with all
concerned parties that people with AIDS must have access to quality
health care.''

   Hundreds of environmentalists demonstrated Monday in the
financial districts of New York and San Francisco, where post-Earth
Day demonstrators shattered windows at the Bank of America.
Authorities said 268 people were arrested in the two cities.
   Also in California, hand-delivered messages claimed
responsibility Monday for vandalism that cut power to some 92,000
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric customers in Santa Cruz and Watsonville.
   In New York, police arrested about 204 of an estimated 700
demonstrators. Two protestors were charged with assaulting an
officer and the rest with disorderly conduct, according to police
spokesmen.
   ``The major corporations have committed a lot of crimes against
nature,'' said Marc Chernoff, 30, a member of New York's Coalition
for a Nuclear Free Harbor. ``It's long overdue to place the blame
where it directly belongs. If the products that pollute were not
made available, people would not buy them.''
   Trade on the New York Stock Exchange went on as scheduled and
none of the protesters got inside. ``Except for getting up a little
early, it's a pretty normal day,'' said the exchange's senior vice
president, Richard Torrenzano.
   At the Pacific Stock Exchange in San Francisco, 49 people were
arrested during a demonstration by 300 to 500 protesters that
turned violent when some broke windows at Bank of America, threw
golf balls, rocks and eggs at police, and overturned newsstands.
   The exchange also opened on schedule although some employees
were delayed.
   Police closed off two blocks of Wall Street to traffic and all
pedestrians except those working there. Traffic elsewhere was
disrupted during the morning and afternoon when protesters walked
through lower Manhattan streets.
   The protest was organized by Earth Day Wall Street Action, which
described itself as a coalition of 60 environmental organizations
in the United States and Canada. It said it wanted to focus
attention on ``institutions responsible for much of the ecological
devastation which is destroying the planet.''
   ``I don't know why they're protesting against Wall Street,''
said James F. Dean, 24, an auditor with J.P. Morgan. ``I don't
think anyone is taking this seriously besides them.''
   ``I think it's great that these guys in suits are stopping to
hear us,'' said Debbie Augustine, 34, of Loudon, N.H., a member of
the anti-nuclear power Clamshell Alliance.
   A spokesman for the San Francisco demonstrators, Daniel
Finkenthal of the Earth Day Action Coalition, said the purpose of
the protest there was to give the public an alternative to the
corporate-sponsored views of environmental action that preceded
Earth Day.
   ``Yesterday these corporations came into our community and spent
a lot of money on a media coup to try to convince the American
public that environmental protection and reform was high on the
corporate agenda, but it's the lowest priority,'' Finkenthal said.
``In fact, they're spending more money on Earth Day promotion than
they are on actual corporate reform and the environment.''
   The group that claimed responsibility for the two California
outages called itself Earth Night Action Group and said the target
was Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, a ``corporate earth rapist.'' Residents
of Santa Cruz and Watsonville were affected by the outages Sunday
and early Monday, caused by damage to power PG&amp;E poles.
   A young male caller to The Associated Press telephoned a few
minutes after delivery of the message to ask if it had been
received. Similar messages went to Bay City News Service and the
San Francisco Examiner. The caller refused to give his name or his
telephone number.
   Elsewhere, the day after Earth Day was the day to clean up the
trash left by the crowds who gathered to celebrate a cleaner Earth.
   In Baton Rouge, La., the grounds of the old state capitol and
the Centroplex auditorium were strewn with trash and it took an
eight-person city crew and a few volunteers three hours and about
65 overflowing trash bins to clean up.
   ``You're not going to change people's actions overnight,'' said
local Earth Day Chairman Paul Davidson. ``I'd like to think it's
cleaner than at past festivals, but I don't know.''
   New York City was better off, even though an estimated 750,000
to 1 million people gathered in Central Park for music and
speeches. Before the celebration, the Parks Department put out 250
55-gallon trash drums and 20 15-gallon recycling bins.
   ``We estimate that 90 percent of all refuse from the concert was
either put into the drums or recycling bins or was placed very
carefully right next to them on the ground when the receptacles
became too full,'' said Parks Department spokeswoman Abigail Meisel.
   By midday Monday, workers had carted away 1 ton of newspapers
for recycling; 3.3 tons of metal and glass for recycling; and 150
tons of other refuse, she said.
   The crowd on the Mall in Washington, D.C., was smaller, more
than 125,000 people, and they left only 6 to 7 tons of trash, said
Earle Kittleman, spokesman for the National Park Service. That
compares with 35 tons left by 400,000 people last July 4.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is ready to announce a series
of economic penalties against the Soviet Union in response to
Moscow's crackdown on Lithuania, U.S. officials said Monday.
   Bush was expected to outline his trategy at a Tuesday meeting
with congressional leaders, said officials who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   Among the steps will be postponment and withholding of a variety
of trade and economic concessions that the Soviet Union is seeking
from the United States, the officials said.
   However, the administration's measures are not intended to
interfere with U.S.-Soviet arms negotiations or to postpone the May
30-June 3 superpower summit, the officials said.
   Although exact details of the administration's package were not
clear, the general thrust will be to slow down U.S.-Soviet trade
liberalization talks, which had been scheduled to resume in Paris
on Tuesday, the officials said.
   Among the actions expected to be announced by Bush on Tuesday
are a withdrawl of his earlier U.S. support for Moscow's bid for
observer status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the
international organization that oversees free-market trading rules.
   Although such an approach would be a measured one, the sanctions
could help mute criticism in Congress that the Bush administration
wasn't doing enough to respond to the Soviet's tightening crackdown
in Lithuania.
   Moscow last week sharply curtailed oil and natural gas supplies
to the secessionist state.
   Earlier Monday, the White House welcomed what it called signs of
flexibility from Moscow in its standoff with Lithuania. And
officials said that the president remained hopeful that the crisis
still could be resolved through negotiations between Moscow and the
rebellious Baltic republic.
   Bush earlier had proposed a variety of U.S. help to the ailing
Soviet economy _ ranging from technical assistance to an easing of
legal restrictions on U.S.-Soviet trade _ that are now expected to
be put on hold.
   Bush, answering reporters who asked if he might call off the
trade talks in response to the Soviet economic crackdown, said:
``I'll sure let you know when I make a decision.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III cautioned last week that
economic relations ``are being put to risk by Soviet actions in
Lithuania.''
   Before the officials disclosed Bush's course, Baker said
consultations with West European governments on a course of action
``will be completed very soon.'' He denied reports the
administration was taking its time in the hopes a solution would
emerge, saying, ``We are not dragging our feet.''
   In a sign of business as usual, a senior State Department
official said Monday that Baker will meet May 5 in Bonn with the
foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Britain and France on
security concerns raised by prospects of German unification.
   In Moscow, the spokesman for Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
said the Kremlin might negotiate with Lithuania if it freezes its
March 11 declaration of independence for two years.
   Arkady Maslennikov, Gorbachev's press secretary, said Soviet
leaders were willing to talk to Lithuanian leaders if they will
acknowledge they are still subject to the Soviet Constitution.
   Lithuanian leaders have refused to do that, saying the republic
was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   The constitution guarantees the right of secession in principle,
but the Soviet Union has never passed implementing legislation.
Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders have acknowledged that the 1940
annexation was illegal.
   Lithuania and its sister Baltic republics of Estonia and Latvia
had belonged to the Russian czars for 200 years when, in the
turmoil that followed the Communist Revolution of 1917, they
established themselves as independent countries recognized by the
Soviet Union in 1920.
   Lithuania's 3.8 million people began their first full work week
since Gorbachev cut off supplies of oil, natural gas and other raw
materials to the republic. On Sunday, Lithuania halted exports to
Soviet republics and foreign customers.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that the Bush
adminstration was still consulting with allies on what course to
take.
   The statements from the Kremlin ``do appear to show some
flexibility. We are hopeful that that's the case,'' he said.
   ``It's impossible for us to know exactly what these statements
... mean, but if they are indicative of the two sides being able to
get together, that would be a welcome sign,'' Fitzwater said.
   Baker discussed Lithuania at the State Department with European
Community officials.
   ``We've talked, at some length, of course, about the problems of
ethnic divisions that face the Soviet Union, and we've talked about
the fact that instability in the Soviet Union does not operate to
the advantage of anyone and is not something to be desired,'' Baker
said at a news conference.
   Meanwhile, a planned meeting Monday between Alexsandr Yakovlev,
the Soviet Communist Party secretary, and Vice President Dan Quayle
was postponed at the Soviets' request, the White House said. The
Soviets gave no reason for postponing the meeting.

<HEAD>City's Newest Bank to Cater to Rich</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new bank created to compete with
Pittsburgh's finest plans to cater to the rich, and will refuse to
open accounts of less than $30,000, company officials said Monday.
   Services known as ``private banking'' have been available at
Mellon Bank and Pittsburgh National Bank for about a decade, but
Pennsylvania Capital officials called those services a ``sideline''
at the big banks.
   ``Our advantage is that's all we do,'' said Charles Warden, a
director of the bank, the first in Pittsburgh in 15 years.
   Officials said there will be no lines for tellers, and for more
sophisticated needs, customers will be assigned a ``relationship
officer'' who will make house calls in some cases.
   Warden said impersonl banking brought about by consolidation in
the financial industry has opened up a niche for banks like
Pennsylvania Capital.
   The bank, which has been been approved by the state banking
secretary, has raised approximately $3 million of the $5 million it
needs to open its doors, president Donald Whitehead said. He said
officials expect to raise the remaining money through private
placements of stock within two months.

<HEAD>First Quarter Reports Show Ad Weaknesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Gannett Co. Inc., blaming what it called the
poorest advertising environment in almost 20 years, reported a
barely perceptible increase in first-quarter earnings April 17.
   Other quarterly reports showed lower earnings for the Tribune
Co. and Media General Inc., and a 16 percent increase for A.H. Belo
Corp. of Dallas.
   Gannett said earnings totaled $75 million, or 47 cents a share,
in the quarter ended April 1, up slightly from $74.9 million, or 47
cents a share, the prior year.
   Revenue slipped less than 1 percentage point to $813.4 million
from $817.6 million a year earlier.
   The company said newspaper advertising revenue declined by 3
percent in the first quarter. Gannett said broadcast revenue also
was lower, but no figures were provided.
   The Tribune Co. of Chicago blamed operating losses at the New
York Daily News and weakness in its newsprint business for a 9
percent earnings drop.
   The company had net income of $33.5 million, or 43 cents a
share, in the three months ended April 1, down from $36.8 million,
or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 6 percent to $584
million from $553 million in 1989's first quarter.
   Operating profit for the company's newspaper publishing group
declined 10 percent to $55.7 million from $61.6 million.
   The company attributed the decrease to larger operating losses
at the Daily News resulting from weaker market conditions and costs
related to contract negotiations with the newspaper's 10 unions.
   Operating profit improved for the rest of the newspaper group
largely due to stronger Chicago Tribune results and lower newsprint
costs, the company said.
   Media General Inc. of Richmond, Va., reported lower revenues,
net income and earnings per share for the first quarter.
   ``Although 1990 revenue growth is expected, the uncertainty of
the economy currently is clouding the earnings outlook,'' said
James S. Evans, the company's president and chief executive officer.
   Revenues declined to $148 million from $149.3 million last year.
Net income dropped sharply, from $11.9 million, or 46 cents a share
in the first quarter of 1989, to $2.7 million, or 10 cents a share
this year.
   First quarter 1989 net income included an after-tax gain of $5.7
million, or 22 cents a share, from the sale of a California
newsprint recycling mill.
   Excluding the 1989 one-time gain, 1990 first quarter net income
fell 56.3 percent.
   Media General said newspaper profits were 44.2 percent lower in
the first quarter. The company blamed the decline on faltering
national, retail and classified advertising sales.
   Media General is the parent of the Richmond Times-Dispatch and
The Richmond News Leader and other daily newspapers as well as
several broadcast operations. Broadcast profits increased 2.5
percent.
   Belo credited increased classified advertising and broadcast
revenue for its earnings increase. The company posted a profit of
$2.8 million, or 14 cents a share, in the first three months of the
year compared with $2.4 million, or 12 cents a share, in the same
period last year.
   Revenue rose to $56.3 million from $53.6 million reported in
last year's first quarter.
   Belo owns and operates The Dallas Morning News, seven community
newspapers in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and five televsion
stations in several states.

<HEAD>Ad Revenue Drop Forces Job Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publisher of The Berkshire Eagle
said April 18 it was laying off 10 employees because of a drop in
advertising revenue.
   The Eagle Publishing Co., which publishes the daily and has a
full-time workforce of 286, will make the first cuts by mid-May,
said President Michael G. Miller.
   Five positions will be cut from the newsroom, and the other five
will be cut from the sales, marketing and business departments, he
said.
   In addition, Berkshires Week, the Eagle's entertainment
supplement, will revert to seasonal publication after the summer
and two additional editing positions will be cut, the publisher
said in a statement.
   ``Our ad revenue was down 3 percent last year, and 10 percent so
far this year,'' Miller said. ``We used to be gangbusters, but now
everything is slowing down.''
   A statement from the Eagle News Association, the union
representing the paper's editorial employees, said many union
members believed the company's purchase and development of an
office complex had drained finances and prompted the layoffs.
   Miller, however, said development of the complex had nothing to
do with the cuts.
   The newspaper has a daily circulation of 34,000 and Sunday
circulation of 35,000.

<HEAD>Journalist Says Fame Keeps Him Behind Bars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prison journalist Wilbert Rideau, recommended
for parole again April 18, said he would be a free man had he spent
his 29 years in the Louisiana State Penitentiary making license
plates instead of running a newspaper.
   Rideau was convicted of killing a woman by cutting her throat
and stabbing her in the heart.
   ``I've tried to make amends the best I could in the only ways
available to me. I've done things that counted over the last 29
years,'' he said. ``That was the only violent act of my life, done
when I was a wild teen-ager. If I could change it, I would.''
   On April 18 the Louisiana Pardon Board recommended for the
fourth time in six years that Rideau be set free. Gov. Buddy Roemer
said he is inclined to reject the unanimous recommendation to
commute Rideau's life sentence. A decision was not expected for at
least a week.
   Rideau has been called a model inmate by prison authorities. The
editor of the prison magazine, The Angolite, he also gives lectures
to youth groups and gets out to go on national speaking tours on
prison reform. Over the years he has had a literary agent and
written free-lance articles for up to four figures for publications
such as Penthouse.
   Rideau has won the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award, the
American Bar Association's Silver Gavel Award and the George Polk
Award for special interest reporting.
   The Polk award came on two articles in The Angolite, ``Prison: a
Sexual Jungle,'' dealing with homosexual rape, and ``The Other Side
of Murder,'' which told of the aftermath of a killing.
   The Angolite, which has carried stories on inmate suicides,
prison riots, prisoner rights, executions, prison sports and
special events, was featured in The New York Times Sunday Magazine
and has been praised in Time magazine, The Washington Post and
Columbia Journalism Review.
   Rideau has appeared on national TV, including ABC's
``Nightline,'' on which he was on a five-man panel with former
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger in a discussion of prison reform.
   And that is why, Rideau thinks, he's still in prison.
   ``Let's face it, they've released thousands of murderers since
I've been in prison. I've watched them come in and go out _ all
anonymous,'' he said.
   ``The governor hasn't searched out the families of their victims
to talk to. They've managed to get out because their greatest
achievement as a prisoner was that they remained anonymous.''
   Of the 31 prisoners sentenced to either death or life in prison
sent to Louisiana State Penitentiary in 1962, only Rideau remains
behind bars.
   ``It's not like I'm asking for special treatment or
consideration, not when the system has released everybody else
routinely convicted of the same or worse crimes. The system exists
for everybody else in the state but Wilbert Rideau,'' he said.

<HEAD>UPI Asks Appeals Court To Continue Reuters Picture Exchange</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for United Press International told a
federal appeals court April 18 it could go out of business if
Reuters is allowed to terminate a photo exchange agreement.
   Three judges of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reserved
decision on UPI's request for an injunction barring Reuters from
terminating the contract.
   The judges, however, extended an earlier stay that keeps the
agreement in effect until they issue a written decision.
   The contract between the news services was made in 1984 and
called for UPI to supply Reuters with pictures from the United
States and for Reuters to provide UPI with pictures from other
countries. It was to run for 10 years beginning in 1985.
   ``We will immediately lose customers the minute Reuters cuts us
off,'' UPI lawyer Mitchell Karlan told the court. ``If we are
unable to get pictures from Reuters, UPI is going out of business.''
   UPI is appealing a decision by U.S. District Judge Peter K.
Leisure that the agency had not shown it would be irreparably
harmed if the arrangement was discontinued.
   The injunction request stemmed from a counterclaim by UPI to a
Reuters lawsuit that seeks to void the picture exchange agreement.
Reuters said the agreement was not living up to expectations.
   Robert Sugarman, an attorney for Reuters, argued against the
injunction on the grounds that UPI had not shown how many customers
it would lose without foreign photos from Reuters.
   Sugarman pointed to testimony from UPI Chairman Earl Brian that
UPI had negotiated to receive foreign photos from the French news
service, Agence France-Presse, for a three-month period in the
event the Reuters contract is discontinued.
   In a statement, Brian said, ``We will continue to pursue UPI's
rights by confronting Reuters' erratic and unwarranted behavior. We
take further encouragement from today's hearing and continuation of
the order against Reuters.
   ``We at UPI consider photos and graphics a strategically vital
component of our business today and in the 1990s,'' he said.

<HEAD>Editorial Financial Disclosure Bill May Get Watered Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation requiring newspaper
editorial writers to sign their work and disclose financial
interests may get watered down in the face of uncertain support,
the bill's sponsor said April 16.
   ``I'd like to salvage the whole thing. But I'm a realist,'' said
Rep. Bruce McEwan, R-Orlando.
   McEwan couldn't gauge the support he had for the bill April 16
before the House Judiciary Committee and asked that a vote be
delayed a week. The bill squeaked out of subcommittee earlier this
month on a 4-3 vote, and McEwan acknowledged many lawmakers are
concerned that it might infringe on the First Amendment's press
protections.
   The bill would include newspaper editorial board members under a
law requiring state managers and most elected officials to file
financial disclosure forms by July 1 every year or face a possible
$5,000 fine.
   ``The public perception out there is that a lot of the
newspapers have special interests too,'' McEwan said.
   In addition, the bill would make it a second-degree misdemeanor
for a newspaper to print any unsigned editorial.

<HEAD>Free Press Passes News Since JOA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The morning Detroit Free Press has passed The
Detroit News, published in the afternoon, in the first circulation
figures released since they entered into a joint operating
agreement.
   Joseph Ungaro, president and chief executive officer of the
Detroit Newspaper Agency, said April 17 the Free Press' total
circulation increase moved the pape to the nation's No. 9 spot
while dropping the News to No. 12. The JOA began in November.
   The Free Press reported a total daily circulation of 639,767
while the News reported 526,147 copies per day. Before the joint
operating agreement, the News published editions all day.
   On Sept. 30, 1989, the Free Press reported daily circulation of
626,434, and the News 690,422.
   The figures are subject to confirmation with the Audit Bureau of
Circulations.
   The combined Sunday edition of the News and Free Press ranks No.
4 in the nation in circulation, trailing The New York Times, the
New York Daily News and the Los Angeles Times.

<HEAD>The National Plans San Diego, San Francisco Editions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National, the sports daily that has been
publishing editions in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles since the
end of January, says it will add San Diego and San Francisco
editions this summer.
   Publisher Peter Price said April 16 he expects the San Diego
edition will start by July 1 and that a San Francisco edition will
be launched in July.
   Price said the newspaper plans to add at least one city a month
to its lineup during the last five months of the year. He did not
identify those cities.
   The National, which offers coverage of national sports
supplemented with local sports in each city where it appears, began
publication Jan. 31. Price said it is distributing an average of
about 350,000 newspapers a day.
   He said the paper hopes to have editions in 10 to 12 cities by
the end of the year with average circulation ``approaching
400,000.''
   Analysts have said that although The National appears to have
made a promising start, it is too early to tell if it can become a
profitable national newspaper.

<HEAD>Judge: Prosecutor Erred in Withholding Files</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TITUSVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on April 17 ordered the state to
pay more than $31,000 in lawyers' fees to The Orlando Sentinel and
Florida Today after ruling that a prosecutor wrongly prevented
reporters from obtaining records in a murder case.
   State Attorney Norm Wolfinger denied requests for copies of
ballistic reports, blood-alcohol tests, autopsy records and other
materials following the shooting deaths of six people at two
shopping centers on April 23, 1987.
   Wolfinger said he feared that releasing the information would
damage Cruse's opportunity for a fair trial by prejudicing
potential jurors.
   Judge Dean Moxley said in his ruling that the amount of
publicity over the case already had been so widespread that release
of the records would not have made a difference.
   State laws provide for release of such public records and assess
penalties against officials who refuse to do so. State insurance
plans will cover the cost of the payments.
   William Cruse was convicted of the murders last year and was
sentenced to death. He remains under psychiatric care at Florida
State Prison.

<HEAD>AP, British Media Ordered To Give Riot Film to Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Associated Press, two British news agencies
and a television company must hand over all film of a March 31 riot
in London that left about 580 people injured, a judge ruled April
20.
   At a hearing in the Old Bailey Central Criminal Court, Judge
Neil Denison said the right of the press to report freely and the
need to trace serious offenders clashed and one had to give way.
   The AP, the British domestic news agency Press Association, and
London Weekend Television opposed the application on grounds it
made them appear an arm of the police and endangered their
photographers.
   The fourth organization, Fleet Street News Agency, made no
objection.
   ``If applications routinely succeed, there is a loss of the
perceived independence of the media,'' Robin Oppenheim, legal
counsel for the three news organizations, told the court.
   Police had sought help from news organizations in identifying
those who participated in the riot that engulfed Trafalgar Square
and London's theater district. The riot broke out after a
demonstration against a new tax.
   Britain's 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act allows a judge
to order news media to turn over material in cases involving
serious offenses.
   On April 6, Denison ordered 25 British newspapers and TV
companies to turn over their film to help identify rioters. Police
then asked for film held by news agencies and London Weekend
Television.

<HEAD>Government Doesn't Have To Reveal Information on Retirees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on April 17 refused to order
the government to reveal the names and addresses of retired or
disabled federal workers.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by an
organization seeking to use the information to recruit new members
in its campaign for increased benefits for retirees.
   The National Association of Retired Federal Employees used to
have an agreement with the federal Office of Personnel Management
that helped the association's drive for new members.
   The agency from 1979 to 1981 permitted the association to send
information packets to newly retired federal workers through an
independent mailing service.
   After the Office of Personnel Management ended the arrangement,
the association sought to obtain the names and addresses under the
Freedom of Information Act.
   A federal judge ruled in favor of the association, but the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals here overturned that ruling last July.
   The appeals court said revealing the names and addresses of
retired and disabled workers would violate their privacy.

<HEAD>Preservationists Fight Newspaper Company Over Historic House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The house where Gen. Robert E. Lee planned
an attack on Union troops to save the Confederate capital has
become the center of a new battle: Preservationists are fighting a
newspaper publisher who wants the now-crumbling structure moved.
   Lockwood House is a two-story, white frame plantation home where
Lee spent three nights just before the Battle of Cold Harbor in
Hanover County in the spring of 1864.
   The house rests on property purchased by Media General Inc. for
a new headquarters and printing plant for its two Richmond
newspapers. The site is about five miles from downtown Richmond.
   J. Stewart Bryan III, who is publisher of the Richmond
Times-Dispatch and The Richmond News Leader and is a member of The
Associated Press Board of Directors, has offered $50,000 to help a
purchaser move the house.
   ``It doesn't belong on that site,'' Bryan said recently, noting
that the house is insect-ridden and has a rotting foundation.
   But 11 organizations, including the Association for the
Preservation of Virginia Antiquities and the Historic Richmond
Foundation, wrote to Bryan last November urging protection of the
house where it is.
   ``Historically and architecturally, it would be devastating to
move it,'' said Linda Marks, president of the Hanover County
Historical Society.
   Bryan's great-great grandfather owned the house in downtown
Richmond where Lee's family lived during the Civil War. His
great-grandparents helped launch Richmond's historic preservation
movement and save the White House of the Confederacy from
demolition. And his father, D. Tennant Bryan, is president emeritus
of the Virginia Historical Society.
   ``It's a simple farm house built in the early 1800s where
General Lee spent two, three or four nights when he was sick with a
high fever. Since then, nobody was interested in the house until we
bought it,'' said Bryan.
   While at Lockwood House, Lee planned an interception of Union
troops that slowed the North's advance on Richmond. He also was
visited there by Confederate President Jefferson Davis.
   The house does not stand exactly where the newspapers' planned
$200 million production plant will be built, but Bryan said the
plant, slated for completion in 1991, would ``overshadow it,
overpower it.''
   During an open house viewing for potential buyers earlier this
month, at least 20 prospects showed up, and about a dozen more have
expressed interest in buying the structure, Bryan said.
   ``We don't care about dollar offers,'' he said. ``We just want
to see it put to good use.''

<HEAD>New Jersey Governor Responds to Article</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Want to get the governor's attention? Slam
New Jersey.
   Ellen Emry Heltzel, an editor at The Oregonian in Portland,
Ore., made a disparaging reference to the Garden State and got a
three-page rebuttal from Jim Florio.
   ``I believe you overlooked the magnificent splendors of New
Jersey, of which there are many,'' Florio says in the April 16
letter to Ms. Heltzel, editor of the newspaper's Northwest Magazine.
   In the March 4 issue of the newspaper's Sunday magazine, Ms.
Heltzel, promoting a new monthly feature on ``out-of-the-way''
Oregon attractions, lamented a homogenization she said could
``leave us indistinguishable from, heaven forbid, New Jersey.''
   Carol Keene of Marmora was in Oregon when the barb appeared.
Irked, she sent Florio a copy.
   The governor sent a virtual tourist brochure rebutting fallacies
and extolling the Jersey Shore, the Kittatinny Mountains, the
Highlands and other points of interest.
   Nothing personal, Ms. Heltzel said in an interview April 18.
   ``I didn't create the myth. I was just fueling it,'' she said.
``New Jersey is the victim of a lot of mythology. ... You think of
problems ... a lot of oil refineries.''
   Ms. Heltzel noted that she found the Jersey Shore lovely, though
somewhat flat compared with Oregon's rugged coast. She says her
criticism was partly a friendly prod at Oregonian Publisher Fred
Stickel, who was born in Weehawken.
   But New Jersey got it again in the April 18 Oregonian. Columnist
Jonathan Nicholas, voicing disgust with fake bookshelves, suggested
that any Oregon designer who uses one ``should immediately be
arrested and shipped to Newark.''

   The company said reporters and publishing executives from

chairman and chief executive officer of Times Mirror.
   ``We further hope that these journalists will find their
experiences in American-style reporting and publishing techniques
useful when they return to the newly independent newspapers of
eastern Europe,'' he said.
   The European journalists, who are to have varying levels of
experience, will be assigned to slots at the Los Angeles Times,

   The San Francisco Chronicle has been named
winner of the Scripps Howard Foundation National Journalism Award
for service to the First Amendment.
   The foundation on April 18 commended the newspaper and Sunday
Punch section editor Peter Sussman for publishing the writings of a
convict-journalist and then defending their right to do so.
   Inmate Dannie Martin's writings led to the release of an
unjustly sentenced man and a review of medical treatment received
by convicts, the judges noted.
   ``The effort of the Chronicle and Sussman not only has helped
illuminate the workings of America's prisons, institutions often
overlooked by the press, it has emphasized the important principle
that to deny an inmate the right to report about what he
experiences is to violate the First Amendment rights of all
Americans,'' the judges said.
   Finalists included The Kentucky Post, Covington, Ky.; The
Milwaukee Journal; and the Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch.
   The Chronicle received $2,500 and a bronze plaque. The newspaper
was among 14 winners in print and broadcast journalism who shared

   The first American released by
pro-Iranian Lebanese captors in nearly 3{ years, a frail-looking
Robert Polhill, walked slowly off a plane today after winning
freedom with the aid of Syria and Iran.
   The 55-year-old educator's release Sunday after 1,182 days of
captivity was followed by a reported call by Iran's foreign
minister for a swift reciprocal move _ freedom for a Shiite Moslem
cleric kidnapped by Israeli troops in July.
   Polhill arrived here on a U.S. Air Force plane, then was taken
by helicopter to a U.S. military hospital in nearby Wiesbaden,
where he was to undergo a medical examination and debriefing by
U.S. intelligence agents.
   President Bush thanked Iran and Syria _ whose military forces in
Lebanon picked up Polhill in west Beirut and drove him to the
Syrian capital of Damascus _ for their help in securing the release.
   But the president said he would make no deals with the
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants in Lebanon still holding 17

prison for counterrevolutionary activities.
   Like an estimated 150,000 other Nicaraguan professionals,
Bonilla, a doctor, fled to South Florida to escape the leftist
Sandinista regime of Daniel Ortega.
   But now that the euphoria of Violeta Chamorro's upset
presidential victory over Ortega in February has subsided, the
professionals Nicaragua needs desperately are weighing a return
carefully _ and many are choosing not to go back.
   Some of the reasons are financial. But much of the concern is
over the role the defeated Sandinistas will play after the new
government is sworn in Wednesday and how those returning will be
treated.
   ``We are afraid,'' said Bonilla, president of the Nicaraguan
Medical Association in Exile. ``(The Sandinistas) are in the same
place with the same weapons. There are only some changes in the
administrative area at this moment.''

   Several environmental organizations at the
forefront of Earth Day celebrations are under fire from a seemingly
unrelated group planning its own march on the Capitol next weekend
_ the National Right to Life Committee.
   The anti-abortion leaders are asking members to withhold support
from environmental groups they regard as pro-abortion. Among those
on the list: the Sierra Club, the National Audubon Society and the
National Wildlife Federation.
   They also are criticizing the League of Conservation Voters, the
environmental movement's major political action committee, for
including ``abortion-related votes'' on its 1989 congressional
scorecard.
   Douglas Johnson, Right to Life's legislative director, said the
listed groups are trying to overturn ``major pro-life policies.''
But Ali Webb, director of elections for the League of Conservation
Voters, said her organization was targeted because it advocates
family planning.
   ``They (Right to Life) represent a point of view that family
planning is not an appropriate arena for environmental action. But
if something isn't done, the world population will double in the
next 37 years,'' Webb said.

   Today is Saturday, May 5, the 125th day of 1990. There are 240
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On May 5, 1920, two Italian anarchists, Nicola Sacco and
Bartolomeo Vanzetti were arrested and charged with the murders of a
shoe factory paymaster and guard in South Braintree, Mass. Their
execution more than seven years later was preceded by worldwide
sympathy demonstrations.
   On this date:
   In 1494, during his second voyage to the New World, Christopher
Columbus first sighted Jamaica.
   In 1818, the political philosopher Karl Marx was born in Prussia.
   In 1821, Napoleon Bonaparte died in exile on the island of St.
Helena.
   In 1891, Carnegie Hall, originally named Music Hall, had its
opening night in New York City, with a concert that included works
conducted by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky and Walter Damrosch.
   In 1904, Cy Young pitched the American League's first perfect
game as the Boston Red Sox defeated the Philadelphia Athletics, 3-0.
   In 1912, the first issue of the Soviet Communist Party newspaper
Pravda was published. In the Soviet Union, where the old-style
calendar was still in effect, the date was April 22.
   In 1925, John T. Scopes was arrested in Tennessee for teaching
Darwin's theory of evolution.
   In 1926, author Sinclair Lewis rejected the Pulitzer Prize for
his novel ``Arrowsmith,'' telling the selection committee in a
letter that ``all prizes, like all titles, are dangerous.''
   In 1942, sugar rationing began in the United States during World
War II.
   In 1955, West Germany became a sovereign state.
   In 1955, the baseball musical ``Damn Yankees'' opened on
Broadway.
   In 1961, astronaut Alan B. Shepard Jr. became America's first
space traveler when he made a 15-minute sub-orbital flight in a
capsule launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   In 1981, Irish Republican Army hunger-striker Bobby Sands died
at the Maze Prison in Northern Ireland in his 66th day without food.
   In 1987, the congressional Iran-Contra hearings opened with
former Air Force Major Gen. Richard V. Secord the lead-off witness.
   In 1987, the federal government began a yearlong amnesty
program, offering citizenship to illegal aliens who met certain
conditions.
   In 1988, the Most Rev. Eugene Antonio Marino became the nation's
first black Roman Catholic archbishop during an installation Mass
in the Atlanta Civic Center.
   Ten years ago: A siege at the Iranian embassy in London ended as
British commandos and police stormed the building.
   Five years ago: President Reagan kept a promise to West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl by leading a wreath-laying ceremony at the
military cemetery in Bitburg.
   One year ago: A federal judge ordered sweeping changes in the
FBI's promotion system, months after the judge found that the
bureau had systematically discriminated against its Hispanic
employees in advancements and assignments.
   Today's birthdays: Actress Alice Faye is 75. Singer Tammy
Wynette is 48. Comedian-actor Michael Palin is 47. Actor
Jean-Pierre Leaud is 46. Actress Tina Yothers is 17.
   Thought for today:
   ``Outside the kingdom of the Lord there is no nation which is
greater than any other.'' _ Haile Selassie, Emperor of Ethiopia
(1891-1975)

<HEAD>Nixon on Gorbachev: `The Most Remarkable Statesman of Our Time'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   In thumbnail appraisal, the man is described
as a consummate pragmatic politician, a leader who likes power and
will do what is necessary to keep it.
   That aim is said to have been the major influence in shaping his
drastic political, economic and foreign policy moves.
   The description comes from Richard M. Nixon, and it sounds as
though the ex-president is looking in the mirror.
   But it is not a self-portrait, it is his judgment of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, ``the most remarkable statesman of
our time.''
   The Nixon comments on Gorbachev in a new book, an undelivered
speech and a public television interview are a blend of admiration
for the Soviet leader's ability and style, and suspicion of his
aims.
   ``Despite what you may hear, that he could be a closet democrat
or even a closet Christian ... Gorbachev is in fact a
true-believing communist,'' Nixon says. ``His goal is not to
abandon communism, but to save it ... not to dismantle the Soviet
empire but to preserve it, as demonstrated by the hard line he is
taking on Lithuanian independence.
   ``But the most dominant facet of his complex personality is that
he is a consummate pragmatic politician who likes power, knows how
to use it, and will do what is necessary to keep it,'' says Nixon,
who lost his own in 1974 when he resigned to avoid impeachment over
Watergate. ``It is this characteristic which has primarily
influenced his decisions to adopt his revolutionary political,
economic and foreign policy reforms.''
   Nixon made those comments in a speech he was to have delivered
to the Boston World Affairs Council, postponed after he was
diagnosed as suffering from a heart rhythm problem. Nixon, 77, is
recuperating at home in Saddle River, N.J., and is expected to
resume his normal schedule in about a week.
   In that text and his newly published eighth book, ``In The
Arena,'' Nixon's comments about the Soviet leader sometimes
parallel his observations about his own career _ 44 years in
office, in resignation and political disgrace, and in what he now
calls renewal.
   ``He is a world class strategic thinker,'' says Nixon _ neither
saint nor a softheaded do-gooder but a skilled, adroit operator in
his own and his nation's interests.
   Reflecting on his own foreign policy in a Public Broadcasting
System interview to be broadcast May 4, Nixon says his course of
detente toward Moscow ``wasn't softheaded negotiation'' but
calculated to serve U.S. objectives.
   ``The detente strategy, hardheaded detente, that I pursued,
worked,'' he said.
   He describes his single most dramatic foreign policy move, the
1972 mission that reopened U.S. links with China, in similar terms.
He says it had nothing to do with any softening of his opposition
to communism. ``It had to do with strategic relationships.''
   Politically, Nixon says, Gorbachev's reforms do not meet
American standards, but have meant breathtaking change in the
Soviet Union. ``After having had their voices stilled for over 70
years, the great silent majority of the Russian people are finally
being heard,'' he says.
   That is a special phrase for Nixon; as a candidate and in his
early White House years he appealed for, and claimed support from
``the great silent majority of my fellow Americans.''
   Nixon calls Gorbachev ``the most intelligent and creative leader
in Soviet history'' _ and also the most powerful since Stalin. He
says the instincts of the pragmatic politician led Gorbachev to his
attempted reforms at home and to acquiescence in the wave of
democratic change that swept Eastern Europe.
   Simply put, Nixon says, ``he had no choice but to reform at home
and to retrench abroad.'' He argues that it will not serve U.S.
interests to help Gorbachev if that produces an economically
stronger Soviet Union that continues to aid anti-American regimes
in the Third World.
   He says those Moscow subsidies still amount to $15 billion a
year in arms and economic aid, and challenges Gorbachev to end them
as part of the price of U.S. trade, credits and technology.
   Still, as an athlete warily praises a rival, Nixon praises
Gorbachev, ``a world class strategic thinker'' and a wily leader
who will survive the perils around him.
   ``I think he will make it,'' Nixon says, ``because he is a very
capable and shrewd politician. And his political instincts will
make him land on his feet even though the problems are infinitely
great.''

   The Supreme Court's nine members are among the
most private of public officials. They wield enormous power, but
rarely hold news conferences or give interviews. Recent polls
indicate only one in three Americans can name any of the nine.
This, the seventh in an occasional series, offers an up-to-date

   He's 84 now, a passionate liberal on an
increasingly conservative Supreme Court. His health is not the
best, but William J. Brennan says he is having too much fun to
retire.
   ``I'm still enjoying myself. Nothing possibly could be as
satisfying,'' he told The Associated Press in an interview days
before his 84th birthday Wednesday.
   ``I've been having some bad health of late. I had that doggone
attack (in March) that started, I thought, as influenza (now
thought to have been a more serious bronchial infection). They gave
me some antibiotics and I had a bad reaction, lost a lot of
weight,'' Brennan said. ``They told me it might be as long as three
months before I finally get fully recovered from it.''
   But retire? ``If I can keep on the way I am, I'm going to
stay,'' he said.
   His stay to date has lasted 34 years and transcended the
administrations of eight presidents.
   In the court's history, only one justice _ William O. Douglas _
wrote more opinions. Only three court members served at more
advanced ages _ Oliver Wendell Holmes at 91, Roger Taney at 87, and
Hugo Black at 85.
   Few have written with such literary grace and eloquence.
   Appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Brennan helped lead
a liberal revolution in American law through the 1960s. The
protection of individual rights was elevated to new heights.
   Some called Brennan an ideologue and an activist. Some called
him a champion of the underdog.
   In a 1987 law school speech, he said, ``When I think of the
progress we have made over the last 30 years, I look upon our
system of civil liberties with some satisfaction and a certain
pride.''
   Gradually, his role changed. Ronald Reagan's legacy _ three key
court appointments _ has left Brennan often outmanned in his fight
against a nascent conservative counter-revolution.
   ``In recent years, the other side has pretty much carried the
day,'' Brennan said. ``That strikes me as nothing to be surprised
about. After all, the president fills the vacancies.''
   In a recent interview published in New Yorker magazine, Brennan
was quoted as saying, ``I'm not discouraged to the point of giving
up. I hope people don't overdo the suggestion that we're headed for
perdition.''
   He added: ``I'm not going to walk out and say the hell with it.''
   Even in recent years, Brennan has registered major successes.
Some of them prompted Daniel Popeo of the conservative Washington
Legal Foundation to state, ``Unfortunately, I think the man is
extremely intelligent. He's been a key player now under three chief
justices. He deserves professional respect.''
   Brennan told AP of one possible exception to his resolve against
retirement: ``If the Good Lord steps in and something happens that
I wouldn't be able to carry on.''
   ``I have a pledge from my wife that the day she notices it
she'll tell me, so I'll act accordingly,'' he said. ``I think it
would be so wrong to stay here unless you're fully able to do your
job. Too much rides on what we do around here.''
   Among the more than 1,200 opinions written by Brennan are
landmarks that imposed a ``one person, one vote'' standard for
electing state legislatures, created constitutional protections for
libel lawsuit defendants, and helped invent a legal definition of
obscenity.
   New York University law professor Burt Neuborne, evaluating
Brennan's opinions and his contribution to the justices'
deliberations, once called him the most influential Supreme Court
member since John Marshall, the great chief justice of the early
19th Century.
   The comment makes Brennan wince.
   ``Honestly, that's so overstated, so overdrawn. Even the greats
of the past _ Holmes, Brandeis _ they'd never stand for such a
claim,'' he said.
   But retired Justice Lewis F. Powell, for 15 years Brennan's
colleague, said in a recent interview, ``I have no doubt he will
have a high ranking among the court's members. Bill is one of
history's great justices.''
   Although far more conservative than Brennan in his judicial
views, Powell said their professional differences ``never impaired
our friendship. He is a man of great personal warmth.''
   Reminded of his reputation as a skilled behind-the-scenes
coalition builder, Brennan took exception. ``I don't know who
invented that. You know damn well it's not true,'' he said. ``You
do your best, and as often as not when you end up with a majority
it reflects many ideas of your colleagues and not only yours.''
   He said the court's members persuade each other in written
memos, not in backroom deals or smoke-filled meetings.
   A sample of Brennan's writing style, and perhaps his power of
persuasion, was displayed in a speech he wrote to celebrate the
Constitution's 200th birthday.
   ``Our entire Constitution is a national treasure; a document of
heady ideals and eloquent, elegant language; a political landmark
for individual rights,'' he wrote.
   ``But one thing the old parchment is not is a china doll that
has to be protected from the regular world by a good layer of
cotton wool. It is a tough old soldier that's collected quite a few
respectable dents in the line of duty.''

   Robert Taft II, whose family produced a
president and two U.S. senators with careers spanning most of this
century, has found that being a Taft is not what it used to be.
   The 48-year-old lawyer, serving his third four-year term as a
Hamilton County commissioner in Cincinnati, abandoned his bid to
become Ohio's next governor in February after disappointing
showings in the polls.
   He said his aborted try for the Republican gubernatorial
nomination made him understand that he needs to become better known
to younger voters.
   ``Among those who knew me, the reaction was positive,'' Taft
said. ``But there was a number who didn't know the family name.
Among those who knew the name, many don't know who I am.''
   Taft is now running unopposed in the May 8 GOP primary for
secretary of state, leaving former Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich
unopposed for the GOP gubernatorial nomination.
   It has been 20 years since a Taft won a statewide election,
although the family name was on the ballot in 1976, 1982 and 1986.
   James Wray, political director for the White House, said that
while the Taft family made ``a tremendous contribution'' to the GOP
and the nation, Taft will have to work to increase his name
recognition.
   ``He's going to have to get out there and identify himself,''
Wray said.
   James Ruvolo, Ohio's Democratic chairman, said Taft is not well
known outside of Cincinnati.
   ``The name is not the drawing card it once was,'' Ruvolo said.
   Taft quit the governor's race after party contributors balked at
funding a costly battle between him and Voinovich. His switch to
the secretary of state's race will pit him in November against
two-term incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown, who is unopposed in his
party's primary.
   Voinovich, state Chairman Robert Bennett and other party leaders
praised Taft as a team player whose willingness to change races
reflected his family's party loyalty.
   Taft's father, Robert Jr., served three terms in the U.S. House
before his election to the Senate in 1970. He was defeated in a
re-election bid in 1976.
   Robert Jr.'s father, Robert A., was known as ``Mr. Republican''
while serving in the Senate from 1939 to 1953. He sought the GOP
presidential nomination in 1952 against Dwight Eisenhower.
   William Howard Taft, father of Robert A. and great-grandfather
of Robert Taft II, served from 1909 to 1913 as the 27th president
and then became U.S. chief justice.
   In 1982, Seth Taft of Cleveland, a businessman and distant
cousin of Robert Jr., ran for the GOP nomination for governor,
finishing second in a field of four.
   Robert Taft II became involved in politics when he helped his
father get elected to the Senate. He served in the Peace Corps and
was a State Department aide in Vietnam.
   Taft served in the Ohio House for two terms, from 1976 to 1980.
He ran for lieutenant governor in 1986 as the running mate of
former four-term Gov. James A. Rhodes, who tried to make a comeback
at age 77 but lost to Democratic incumbent Gov. Richard Celeste.
   ``I think I got some visibility in 1986, but Rhodes was the
issue,'' Taft said. ``It was difficult to emerge clearly.''
   Last year, Taft decided to head his own ticket in the race to
succeed Celeste, who ends his second consecutive four-year term in
January and is barred by law from seeking a third. Taft announced
his candidacy in June and insisted through most of the year that he
was in the race to stay.
   ``But among a lot of voters, particularly, maybe younger voters,
maybe there wasn't a lot of awareness built up. I had never been
involved on my own in a statewide campaign,'' he said.
   Taft's exit from the gubernatorial race sparked rumors that a
deal was cut for a future party endorsement, perhaps for the U.S.
Senate in 1992, when Democratic incumbent John Glenn's term expires.
   Taft denied having plans beyond this year. ``I think in
politics, it's a mistake to look beyond the office you are
seeking,'' he said.

   With the two Germanys moving toward unification,
here is a chronicle of a dark period in World War II, the war that
led to the division of Germany in the first place. It was 50 years
ago this month that Adolf Hitler's forces blitzed across Western
Europe, forcing the heroic evacuation of more than 300,000 Allied
troops at Dunkirk, and France collapsed.

   The stalemate in Europe ended. Sitzkrieg became blitzkrieg.
   Fifty years ago next Thursday, at dawn on May 10, 1940, Adolf
Hitler blew the whistle and for the second time in nine months let
loose the full force of his dogs of war.
   On the same day, almost by acclamation, Winston Churchill was
called on to be prime minister of Great Britain.
   During the winter German forces had taken Norway and Denmark
almost as military exercises, adding them to the bulging Nazi sack
with Poland, Czechoslovakia and Austria.
   Now Hitler's targets were the Low Countries, the Netherlands,
Belgium and Luxembourg, all neutrals, all assured repeatedly of
Germany's peaceful intent.
   In five days he leveled Rotterdam and crushed Holland, sending
Queen Wilhemina and the Dutch government into exile in Britain. But
Holland was only a battle in passing.
   His steel phalanxes, spearheaded by Stuka dive bombers and
paratroopers, next turned to Belgium, having breached the steep
banks of the Meuse. Across four bridgeheads poured an armored
assault the likes of which Europe had never seen before.
   German tanks in three columns a hundred miles long roared and
clanked through Sedan, shattering two French armies in a dash
toward the English Channel, cleaving the Allied forces in half,
trapping the best of the British and French divisions in Belgium to
the north.
   Tactically, the Germans uncorked one innovation after another.
Special task forces were assigned specific targets, fortresses and
bridges, and delivered by parachute and glider. For this they had
practiced on replica targets in Germany the previous winter.
   The formidable Fort Eben Emael was a case in point. It was the
strongest fortress in all of Europe, a steel and concrete bastion
dug deep into Belgian soil, heavily armored with gun turrets and
manned by 1,200 men.
   The German assault was mounted by a task force of 80 men,
commanded by a sergeant and borne to the fort by nine gliders that
landed on the roof.
   Specially made hollow explosives knocked out the gun turrets,
spreading gas and flame everywhere. Flamethrowers were then turned
against every aperture, essentially blinding the fortress.
   Panzer units and dive bombers finished the job. A white flag was
posted at noon of the 11th. The fortress had fallen in 30 hours. Of
the 80-man task force, there were only six killed and 19 wounded.
It presaged what would happen to France's vaunted Maginot Line.
   On the second day of the advance, German commanders felt the 15
divisions and six in reserve of the Sixth Army in the north could
fend off any attack by the 24 British and French divisions and the
15 Belgian divisions facing it. To the south they greatly
outnumbered the Allied forces.
   A week after the invasion of Holland, the German forces were
rolling across undefended French countryside. Churchill was
astounded to discover the French had committed all their reserves
and were essentially broken.
   Although his generals were confident, Hitler himself was a
bundle of nerves. He expected a French counterattack that would
isolate his armies. His caution was clearly uncalled for.
   He authorized a ``reconnaisance in force'' and with that
permission seven armored divisions pressed westward and by May 19
were only 50 miles from the Channel.
   The next day the Second Panzer Division had reached the mouth of
the Somme River and the British Expeditionary Force, three French
armies and the Belgians were trapped, 40 divisions in all. The
formerly worried Hitler was overjoyed.
   Then came an incredible series of events.
   The French chose this moment to change commanders and precious
time was lost, leaving little chance to move south and break out of
the German circle of fire and steel.
   By the 24th the Allies had their backs to the Channel. The
Germans were in sight of Dunkirk. Evacuation by sea was the only
option left.
   Then, at the edge of victory, Hitler ordered his panzers to
stop, probably in a bow to the Luftwaffe and Hermann Goering who
wanted his Heinkels and Messerschmitts to finish the Allies off. Or
perhaps he thought of conserving his army.
   The British, smelling defeat, had been gathering all kinds of
boats, anything that could make it across the Channel. Churchill
ordered all non-combatants taken off first. Meanwhile, the
Belgians, holding the northern rim of the Dunkirk peimeter, were
beginning to weaken.

   On the evening of May 26, the British ordered up the hastily
designed Operation Dynamo. The first British troops, most of them
from heavily hit divisions, were home that night, plucked from port
and beach by the makeshift flotilla.
   The British searched boatyards for motorboats and launches,
yanked lifeboats from liners at London docks, mobilized tugs from
the Thames, and called into service barges and pleasure craft,
fishing boats and small coastal steamers. On the night of May 27,
this second fleet headed toward Dunkirk.
   In all, 400 small vessels joined the British Navy, an armada
that eventually numbered 860 craft. Churchill noticed that some of
his own staff were mysteriously absent as all of England
established a lifeline to its stricken troops.
   At first, the huddled British and French were pummeled by the
Luftwaffe, but gradually the Royal Air Force eroded their numbers.
   Wrote Churchill, ``To and from between the shore and the ships
plied the little boats gathering the men from the beaches as they
waded out or picking them from the water, with total indifference
to the air bombardment...Their numbers alone defied air attack. The
Mosquito Armada as a whole was unsinkable. In the midst of our
defeat, glory came to the Island people, united and unconquerable.''
   It continued until June 4, beyond the point anyone thought the
rear guard could hold out. In the end, more than 338,000 troops
were rescued, including 60,000 of the 100,000 French. Left on the
beaches and docks of Dunkirk were 7,000 tons of ammunition, 90,000
rifles, 2,300 artillery pieces, 82,000 vehicles, 8,000 Bren guns
and 400 anti-tank rifles. But the men were saved to fight again.
   To re-arm them, the United States went to its military
warehouses and sold the defeated Allies 500,000 World War I rifles,
900 French 75 field guns and 80,000 machine guns. It left the
arsenal of democracy with weaponry for only 1.8 million men.
   While the Dunkirk evacuation proceeded, King Leopold III,
against the advice of his government and with the shortest possible
notice to his Allies, surrendered Belgium to the Germans on May 28.
   On June 5, the day after Dunkirk fell, Hitler turned his full
attention to the 65 French divisions and less than two British
divisions in the south. To that task he unleashed 143 divisions, 10
of them armored.
   On June 10, the French government fled to Bordeaux and four days
later German troops raised the swastika over the Eiffel Tower. The
French asked for armistice, but Hitler said he would have to
consult first with Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, who now felt
he could join the party. On June 11, he ordered his 32 divisions to
attack on the Alpine front. After a week of fighting they had not
been able to advance against six French divisions.
   On the afternoon of June 21, at Compiegne where the Germans had
surrendered to the Allies in World War I, William L. Shirer, author
of ``The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,'' watched as Hitler read
the inscription on the memorial plaque that said:
   ``Here on the eleventh of November 1918 succumbed the criminal
pride of the German Empire _ vanquished by the free peoples which
it tried to enslave.''
   About Hitler on that day, Shirer wrote, ``I have seen that face
many times at the great moments of his life. But today! It is afire
with scorn, anger, hate, revenge, triumph ... Suddenly, as though
his face were not giving quite complete expression to his feelings,
he throws his whole body into harmony with his mood. He swiftly
snaps his hands on his hips, arches his shoulders, plants his feet
wide apart. It is a magnificent gesture of defiance, of burning
contempt for this place now and all that it has stood for in the 22
years since it witnessed the humbling of the German Empire.''
   Seventeen days earlier, before the House of Commons, as the
Dunkirk evacuation ended, Churchill directed himself to the free
world in a one-sentence pledge that will never be forgotten:
   ``Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous
states have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all
the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail, we
shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight in
the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and
growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island whatever
the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on
the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the
streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and
even if, which I don't for a moment believe, this island or a large
part of it were subjugated or starving, then our Empire beyond the
seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the
struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its
power and might, steps forth to the rescue and liberation of the
Old.''

   When Les Tyler talks about his rescue from
Dunkirk, the story is told with music and tears.
   Tyler was a 20-year-old private in the British army in May 1940
as he waited under enemy fire and prayed for a boat to save him
from the advancing German guns.
   He had been shot in the arm during fierce fighting near Arras,
Belgium, and was sent to a medical station for evacuation. But
while awaiting transport home, he was instructed to retreat to
Dunkirk on foot. It was every man for himself.
   Burrowed between the sheltering dunes, wounded and watching
other young men dying all around him, Tyler had some doubts he
would survive.
   ``But I'm not the kind of person to give up easily,'' says
Tyler, 71. ``Instead of giving up, I get a tune in my head.''
   So while the bullets blazed around him and his comrades watched
the sea and prayed, Tyler took out a harmonica and played.
   ``I played everything I knew,'' Tyler recalls. ``And the more
scared I got, the harder I played.
   ``I played `Roll Out the Barrel,' and `Pack Up Your Troubles in
an Old Kit Bag,' pieces from operettas and marching songs and, over
and over, Vera Lynn's `White Cliffs of Dover.'''
   Often during his two-day wait, Tyler thought he'd never see the
familiar cliffs again. German Stuka fighters screamed overhead,
strafing and bombing the beach. Bullets struck the sand inches
away. He wanted to go home.
   ``It just made me so angry to be stuck there only a few miles
from Dover,'' he says. ``Every time a plane came over I shot at it,
even though I knew it was impossible to hit with a rifle. I was
just so mad.''
   Just across the English Channel, a huge armada of ships large
and small was assembling for the Dunkirk evacuation.
   ``We were told ships would come,'' he recalls. ``It was chaos.
More and more men were joining us all the time. Lads were spread
out along the sand as far as you could see.''
   Tyler's narrative stops as his eyes fill with tears and he
chokes back a sob. His wife helps fill gaps in the story.
   All along the road were terrified French refugees fleeing
advancing German troops.
   ``I had been separated from my unit, the Northamptonshire
Regiment,'' Tyler says. ``So while I was with a crowd on the road
and beach, I was all alone and knew no one.''
   Toward dusk at the end of the second day, the Little Ships
finally appeared on the horizon. ``I thought: `Thank God.'''
   But it was still a long while before he set sail for home. He
spent hours standing in neck-deep waves. A short man, Tyler had
trouble keeping head above water. He lost his rifle. Some men gave
up in exhaustion, sank and drowned. German planes continued their
murderous fire.
   Long after dark, Tyler finally was pulled aboard a commercial
ferry, the SS Canterbury. Later he learned that of the 1,000 men in
his regiment, only 20 survived.
   Historians say the evacuation from Dunkirk was the key to the
war, saving the lives of 338,000 men needed to fight later battles.
But Tyler was sent to mine coal in Surrey for the duration of World
War II.
   He became a railroad guard. Now retired, he is president of the
Dover branch of the Dunkirk Veterans Association.
   Dunkirk was not Tyler's last war. He was sent to Korea, captured
in the Battle of Imjim River and survived two years in the prisoner
of war camp at Chong Song.
   ``I'm not the kind of person to give up easily, '' Tyler says.

<HEAD>Veterans and History Buffs To Mark Flotilla</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DUNKIRK, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A flotilla of hundreds of vessels will
sail across the English Channel in a re-enactment of the dramatic
rescue of more than 300,000 Allied troops trapped on the beaches of
Dunkirk 50 years ago.
   The voyage in late May will kick off a summer of exhibits,
concerts and parties commemorating the evacuation.
   At least 5,000 veterans are expected in Belgium, England and
France for events ranging from a quiet service in a military
cemetery to a beer bash in a NATO airport hangar.
   A few of the veterans already are in their 90s. Some are coming
from as far away as Australia. Organizers are hoping to make the
commemoration worth the trip for the vets and for the thousands of
history buffs and tourists who also will be on hand.
   ``Some people regard Dunkirk as a defeat, but for us it was the
beginning of a bigger victory,'' says Lucien Pelfrene, who was 11
at the time of the evacuation and now is helping organize events in
De Panne, Belgium.
   ``For us, these men are heroes and will be welcomed here just as
they were at the liberation.''
   About one-third of the 338,000 men evacuated were taken from
beaches at De Panne, about 20 miles from Dunkirk.
   Cafe and bar owners in the Belgian resort will compete May 25 to
see who can make their establishment look most like a traditional
English pub. Fireworks will light the sky over the English Channel
and military music will fill the air.
   On May 28, after a day of commemorative ceremonies at Town Hall
and on the beach, veterans and their friends will dance to 1940s
swing in an enormous hangar at NATO's Koksyde Airbase nearby.
   Fireworks, parades and concerts by military bands also are
planned in Dunkirk, but the centerpiece of the commemoration will
be the arrival of the so-called Little Ships.
   About 70 of the original boats will sail out of Dover's
Wellington Docks on May 24, escorted by the modern naval frigate
HMS Alacrity and hundreds of modern boats.
   ``Everybody who owns a boat wants to sail along,'' says Chris
Lean, an organizer of the events and the director of tourism for
the Dover District Council.
   ``It will be spectacular,'' he says. ``On a clear day you can
see France from the cliffs and on that day you will see a huge
flotilla of fishing boats, yachts, paddle steamers, ferries, boats
of all kinds, sailing across the channel.''
   The boats will dock for three days in Dunkirk. Then they will
form a circle into which a helicopter will drop a wreath.
Exhibition flying teams from England and France will do flyovers
during the events.
   Dover's events will extend through July and include concerts,
dances, a harborside exhibit on the evacuation, and the opening of
an unusual historic site under Dover's imposing 12th century Norman
castle.
   More than a mile of cavernous tunnels carved into the chalky
White Cliffs in Napoleonic times will open to the public on May 14.
   Sections of these tunnels were the headquarters for Operation
Dynamo, the code name for the evacuation.
   Visitors to the tunnels can stand on the same 500-foot high
vantage point overlooking Dover Harbor where Winston Churchill
looked across to his helpless troops under fire.
   The tunnels, begun in the early 1800s, saw their finest hour as
Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsey and his staff worked non-stop 200 feet
below ground planning the miraculous nine-day evacuation.

   Montana's prison has had chronic overcrowding. Currently 1,100
prisoners are in a facility designed for 744. State law allows
early eligibility for parole when the prison exceeds capacity for
more than 30 days.
   Oregon has released prisoners early for years. The state also
has a rotating bunk system, whereby an inmate is released for seven
days while another takes his bunk. When the first inmate returns,
someone else is released for a week.
   In April 1989, the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles began an
emergency early release of 3,000 prisoners to avert a threatened
federal lawsuit. Georgia's prisons were about 110 percent over
capacity, with 4,000 state prisoners backed up in county jails. By
September 1989, it had dropped to 40 percent over capacity, with
1,400 prisoners backed up.
   However, while the release program was going on, Georgia still
recorded a 4.8 percent increase in prisoners in the first six
months of 1989, reaching 20,000 prisoners and climbing.
   Under the POPS program, 200 Tulane University law students are
compiling medical and legal histories of all Louisiana inmates 55
and older.
   Louisiana has 799 prisoners who are 60 or older, says Martha
Jumonville of the Department of Corrections. As of December 1989,
1,989 prisoners faced sentences of life, 266 faced 99 years, and
928 faced between 35 and 98 years.
   Other than medical furloughs for the severely disabled, there
are no special provisions for releasing the elderly or impaired,
Jumonville says.
   Less than 10 medical furloughs have been granted in the past
year, prison officials say. To qualify, a prisoner must be
recommended by the warden and medical staff and must be permanently
incapacitated or expected to die within six months, says Jane
Bankston, a consultant to the Secretary of Corrections.
   They must also have someone who agrees to care for them and pay
all their medical expenses, says Deputy Warden Richard Peabody.
   Prisoners eligible for parole may apply for consideration every
six months. Because most of the elderly inmates were sentenced
without the possibility of parole, they must first apply for a
pardon which can only be done once a year and must be approved by
the governor if granted.
   The average expense for medical care and maintenance for inmates
over 55 is $69,000 a year, about three times the average for other
inmates, Turley says.
   ``The costs of keeping these men in prison is staggering,''
Turley says. ``The suffering it inflicts on the elderly prisoner
who can't get proper care and lives in fear of younger inmates is
appalling.''

   Don't look now, but dancers are starting to
touch each other again. A generation that grew up on rock 'n' roll
and disco is learning the pleasures of swaying to the rhythms of
sweet ballroom music. And it's not just the older folks, say dance
instructors who are cashing in on the trend.

   The Brazilian lambada dance craze may
be the fad in some circles but a resurgence of old-fashioned
ballroom dancing is also sweeping couples back into each other's
arms.
   That's sweet music for dance school operators who stand to
benefit the most.
   ``People are turning away from the loud noise and that sort of
thing,'' says Richard Stephenson, author of ``The Complete Book of
Ballroom Dancing.''
   ``They would like to get back into other types of dancing, but
the problem is they don't know any other type of dancing.''
   There are plenty of people willing to teach them. Across the
nation, local adult education programs are trying to meet the
demands for more and more classes. In this Ohio River city, two
West Virginians recently opened the Academy of Ballroom Dance.
   ``The market is everywhere,'' says Rebecca Richardson, co-owner
of the Huntington academy. ``If people go out and see the cha-cha
or the rumba, they like it. They don't know what it is, but they
like it.
   ``It's ballroom dancing.''
   America's departure from ballroom dancing is blamed in part on
rock 'n' roll music and the '60s movement away from tradition. It
was downright difficult to try ballroom moves to a rockin' Buddy
Holly tune and it became gauche for men to lead a dance during the
women's movement.
   ``Women found that they wanted to be able to stand alone,'' says
Tom Cyrus, Ms. Richardson's partner.
   But, alas, romance has re-entered the picture.
   Ballroom dancing was also hurt by fly-by-night dance hall
instructors who insisted that 80-year-old widows needed 20 years'
worth of lessons.
   There always was some demand for ballroom dance lessons during
the rock and disco years, but nothing like there is today, Ms.
Richardson says.
   ``It's not 70-year-olds going to clubs bringing back ballroom
dancing,'' she says. ``It's the younger people.''
   Stephenson wrote his book with a Connecticut dance instructor in
1980 after noting a resurgence in ballroom dancing on their college
campus.
   ``One of the house mothers called him and suggested he come over
to her dorm,'' Stephenson says. ``They were having a waltz party,
dancing on the carpet in the old dormitory.''
   Stephenson still sells about 3,000 copies of the hardcover book
each year, he says.
   Ballroom dancing involves intricate balance, says dancer and
choreographer Marge Champion.
   ``It's no fun to dance unless you really have a partner who you
can counterbalance with,'' says Champion, who with her husband,
Gower, worked on Broadway and toured clubs and television shows in
the '40s and '50s.
   Dave and Anne Griffin of Huntington recently glided, sputtered
then glided again through their fourth dance lesson.
   Griffin had a few lessons as a youngster, but Mrs. Griffin had
never touched a dance floor in a formal setting.
   ``All I ever did was what all college kids do _ go to the local
joint and do whatever everyone else was doing,'' she says.
   Griffin, who was formerly in law school and now is finishing
medical school, says that in some social-business circles, knowing
how to dance is an asset.
   ``I muddled around out there and hoped that nobody would
notice,'' he says. ``Most of the time, I sat on the side.''
   Stephenson, who also has written two chemical engineering
textbooks, cites the romantic benefits.
   ``A lot of people who meet in the dance classes end up getting
married,'' he says. ``The types of kids you're going to meet in the
dance class are probably a lot more compatible than ones you're
going to meet at bars and lounges.''
   Many high schools have turned gymnasiums used for physical
education classes into temporary dance halls, with teachers
breaking out square dance or waltz records and telling students to
pair up.
   Stephenson says the teachers are trying to teach proper behavior.
   ``Students now realize this is an important way to interact with
the opposite sex,'' he says. ``Some students were so hung up that
if they put their arm around their partner, it was an invitation to
go to bed with them.''
   But dancing is just supposed to be fun, says Elsa Clemensen of
Ashland, Ky., who, at 87, is the Huntington ballroom dance
academy's oldest student.
   ``I want to dance like those girls in the beautiful dresses on
TV,'' she says.

   The industrialized East is not known as a haven
for wildlife and big game. But Pennsylvania is taking pains to
preserve a herd of elk as a natural legacy and a tourist
attraction. It's one of only two such herds east of the Mississippi
River.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By DAVID MORRIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAINT MARYS, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The thumping of the hovering helicopter
shatters the tranquillity of the rugged landscape in north-central
Pennsylvania, sending a herd of female elk and their offspring
scrambling along a hillside.
   About 50 yards away, a bull elk suddenly appears, 1,000 pounds
of muscle and nearly 4 feet of sweeping antlers.
   ``He's coming to protect them,'' the pilot says over the headset
as the chopper hovers briefly above the treetops.
   Indeed, the dominant bull's presence appears to calm the other
elk as the helicopter slowly circles the ridge on a sunny afternoon.
   Similar scenes are played out whenever crews from the
Pennsylvania Game Commission and the Bureau of Forestry conduct the
annual census of Pennsylvania's small but stable elk herd.
   At last count, the news was good. There are 154 elk here, the
most since the count was started in the early 1970s. Through most
of the last decade, the herd ranged between 120 and 140 animals.
   In colonial times, elk roamed across much of the state, but
development, an expanding population and commercial hunting made
the native elk extinct in the state by 1867.
   The roots of the current herd can be traced to 1913, when the
Game Commission placed some Rocky Mountain elk in north-central
Pennsylvania and in the Pocono Mountains region of the Northeast.
The Pocono herd died out, leaving the only elk in the state
confined to about a 200-square-mile area in Elk and Cameron
counties.
   There are major concentrations of elk in the western United
States, where hunting them is popular. But Pennsylvania has one of
only two herds east of the Mississippi. The largest concentration
of elk in the East is in Michigan.
   Bill Drake of the Game Commission, who supervised the census
from a hangar at Saint Marys Airport, says, ``For Pennsylvanians,
elk are pretty impressive. They're not only large, but they're
graceful and they're beautiful.''
   The small size of the state's elk range allows the searchers to
concentrate their efforts. But without snow, getting an accurate
count is impossible, even though an elk is five or more times
larger than the more common white-tailed dee. The elk stand out
against a backdrop of snow, and their tracks and beds are easier to
spot. But the rest of the year, their coats of brown and tan blend
with the forest floor.
   Last year, unseasonably warm weather prompted cancellation of
the census. This year, some snow aided visibility at the start of
the week, but it was melting quickly so the crews had to step up
the pace.
   Drake plotted the progress on a big wall map, keeping in touch
with the crews by radio and telephone. It's not easy. There was an
unconfirmed report that three large male elk were parading in a
field several miles away. They need to be confirmed by game wardens
before they can be added to the count.
   ``Is there anything we can do to find those three?'' Drake asks.
``We can use every elk we can find.''
   He predicted 171 but was resigned to the fact that the actual
count would fall far short.
   It is frustrating. For instance, one ground crew reported
finding three fresh beds but saw only two bull elk. They debated
for a few minutes before Drake quietly but firmly said he wouldn't
count an elk that nobody saw.
   The census also counts the number of elk that have died. In an
average year, 13 animals die. In 1989, the mortality count was 10.
Five, including one found with its antlers removed with a chain
saw, were killed illegally; two were klled by farmers because their
crops were being destroyed; one died of unknown causes and one _ a
Goliath-like victim of a much smaller foe _ died of malnutrition
with porcupine quills in its mouth.
   Hunters are not allowed to kill elk in Pennsylvania, but Drake
and others acknowledge a limited hunt is not out of the question at
some point in the future. They are quiet about it. In the early
1980s, when the commission publicly said a hunt might be held,
farmers and poachers jumped the gun. Twenty-six elk were killed
illegally in one year.
   ``They thought if we had trouble with too many elk, they'd
handle it locally rather than let people come in and hunt from
outside the county,'' Drake said. ``That's what we think happened.''
   A local elk committee has been set up to keep farmers, sportsmen
and the Game Commission informed of illegal kills. To draw elk away
from farmland, some public land has been clear-cut to provide food
for the herd.
   The herd has become a tourist attraction in recent years, and
Mark Rupprecht, owner of Elk County Ammo and Arms, knows where they
gather.
   In the fall, for instance, motorists can see as many as 60 elk
in a field just outside town. ``There's a lot of traffic out
there,'' Rupprecht said. ``It's hard to get a parking space.''
   Drake adds, ``If we can maintain elk, it's kind of an indication
that we still have some areas in Pennsylvania that have a pristine
quality of environment.''

   Ted Danson, like many people raised near
inland deserts, finds himself irresistibly drawn to the oceans.
   And his love affair with the sea, which began with boyhood
visits from his home in Arizona, is reflected in a new cable TV
series.
   Danson, best known as the star of NBC's ``Cheers,'' is host and
narrator of ``Challenge of the Seas,'' now appearing weekly on the
Arts &amp; Entertainment Channel.
   He isn't abandoning ``Cheers'' yet _ at least before another
season _ but he says the end is near.
   The 26-week A&amp;E series examines the role that the oceans and
their inhabitants play in the balance of the earth's ecology.
   ``You can't separate the oceans from the rest of the world,''
Danson says ``Nor can you talk about the oceans without talking
about the rain forests or any other part of the world. The oceans
are a metaphor. Everything you put into the air or into the ground
ends up in the ocean.''
   He was asked to host the series because of his work with the
American Oceans Campaign, an environmentalist group he helped
organize three years ago.
   ``Hardy Jones and his wife, Julia Whittey, came to see me,'' he
says. ``They're divers and documentary filmmakers. He produced it
and wrote it and stars in the show with his wife. They have some
absolutely amazing underwater footage.
   ``Down in Baja, in the Sea of Cortez, they dove with hundreds of
hammerhead sharks. The bubbles from the air tanks drove off the
sharks, so they did free diving to 100 feet to get their pictures.
   ``One of the reasons I wanted to do this is that Hardy filmed
unbelievable pictures of fish and animals in their natural habitat.
It's more than just a nature film. It shows that what we do on land
impacts on the sea around us.''
   Danson's wife, Casey, and environmental attorney Robert Sulnick
are co-founders of the American Oceans Campaign, which has offices
in Santa Monica and Washington.
   ``Our purpose is to preserve and restore our oceans,'' Danson
says. ``That's a pretty broad statement, but we are working on
three programs. They are curtailing offshore oil drilling, stopping
coastal pollution and outlawing international drift nets.
   ``Some of those drift nets are 50 miles long and they can sweep
an area the size of Ohio every night. The nets kill everything in
their path, and if they break loose they float around forever
killing fish.''
   Upcoming episodes of the series will deal with such subjects as
dolphins, sea lions, gray whales, sea otters, hammerhead sharks,
undersea volcanoes, the mile-deep canyon near the Bahamas, sea
birds, marine sanctuaries and parks, and kelp beds.
   Although Danson grew up in Arizona, where his father was an
archaeologist, in the summer the family vacationed in California.
``A visit to the ocean was like a pilgrimage,'' he says.
   Danson, just recovered from a case of chickenpox picked up from
his children, is back at work at Paramount Studios to complete a
two-part episode wrapping up the eighth season of ``Cheers.''
   ``I'll be back for another season, but after that we'll have to
see,'' he says. ``Kirstie Alley calls me `waffle boy' because I
change my mind daily about continuing the show. But it's getting
close to the end.''
   Despite his success in such theatrical movies as ``Dad,''
``Cousins'' and ``Three Men and a Baby,'' Danson has no plans to
abandon television.
   ``In my mind, it makes sense to stay in television,'' he says.
``If I weren't as successful in films I'd probably go into it more
just to raise my batting average. It's hard to say goodbye to a
group as good as ours at `Cheers.' People are still watching.''
   Danson has also launched another new television series, NBC's
``Down Home.'' He is one of the executive producers.
   ``Down Home'' stars Judith Ivey as a woman who returns after
several years in New York to her hometown in Texas to help her
father save his small bait-and-tackle business.
   Danson and Ivey met when they co-starred in the TV movie ``We
Are the Children'' in Africa.
   Next up for Danson is ``Three Men and a Little Lady,'' the
sequel to the hit comedy movie. Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg and
Nancy Travis, as the mother, will also reprise their roles. Leonard
Nimoy directed ``Three Men and a Baby'' but he is working on
another project, so Emile Ardolino (''Dirty Dancing'') will direct.

^A Kinder, Gentler Commune After Guru's Death</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>POONA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buffeted by the recent death of its god and
a drop in donations, the commune of the late free-love guru Osho
Rajneesh is trying to save itself by going mainstream.
   Emphasis has shifted from mystical sex to meditation exercises.
Primal screaming was banned after neighbors complained of the
noise. Deals have been signed with prominent companies for
distribution of video cassettes.
   ``We are mellowing,'' said Swami Tatahgat, an Indian board
member of Rajneesh Foundation, the trust that controls the commune.
``Before, we used to wear our rebelliousness on our sleeves.''
   It appears to be a kinder, gentler commune now than at
Rajneeshpuram, Ore., where, according to commune residents and
spokesmen for the Poona press office, members administered
barbiturates and other drugs to rivals they considered
``negative.'' Rajneesh called himself Bhagwan, or God, in those
days.
   No longer do disciples prance half-naked through the halls of
the local five-star hotel, the Blue Diamond. The hotel recently
welcomed them back, but only for meals.
   The lush 11-acre campus, with its miniature waterfalls, outdoor
Japanese restaurant and high-tech workout rooms, seems more like a
summer camp for adults than a focus for worldwide revolution in
consciousness.
   All visitors are required to produce the results of an AIDS test
no more than a month old. Westerners seen groping at one another's
bodies on Poona's streets may get a talking to by other followers.
   Osho mediatatio is taught at the Tata Management School, a Poona
business college. The commune has a contract with CBS@India
to distribute videotapes of Rajneesh's lectures, and another with
Pocket Books to publish his writings.

   Day breaks at the Osho International Commune.
   Disciples gather for a meditation session in Lao Tzu Hall, where
the guru's ashes are housed in a small vault kept on his marble bed.
   Pattering into the house, they pass through a marble room
furnished only with a plush dental chair.
   ``This is where Osho had his teeth fixed,'' Swami Subhuti, a
commune spokesman, intones reverently. He used to be Peter Waight,
a newspaper reporter in London.
   Inside the mausoleum, once Rajneesh's bedroom, disciples move
close to the vault containing his ashes. ``Never born, never
died,'' reads the epitaph on black marble.
   A stocky guard flicks a remote-control switch. Lights in an
ornate glass chandelier dim. A chime rings and meditating begins.

   Osho Rajneesh, the mesmerizing guru of quick-fix enlightenment,
died Jan. 19. At the height of his popularity, the 58-year-old
former teacher of Sanskrit amassed 500,000 followers, 87 Rolls
Royces, diamond-studded watches and gowns fashioned from gold
thread.
   Rajneesh started his movement in India in the late 1960s,
preaching a blend of Eastern mysticism, free love and pop
psychology. Among his 650 works are such titles as ``Take It Easy''
(Vols. I and II) and ``Ya-Hoo.''
   He changed his name numerous times, adopting Bhagwan, Zorba the
Buddha and finally, Osho, ``the one the heavens shower with
flowers.''
   In the early 1980s, Rajneesh moved his band of red-robed
followers to a 64,229-acre ranch in the hills of central Oregon.
   Rancho Rajneesh disbanded after the master was kicked out of the
United States in 1985 for immigration fraud, and the American
movement degenerated into a miasma of poisonings and costly court
cases.
   Ma Anand Sheela, Rajneesh's former chief aide, was sentenced to
4{ years in prison for arson, attempted murder and masterminding a
food-poisoning outbreak that made 750 townspeople ill. Other aides
avoided prosecution by cooperating with police.
   Rajneesh advocated breaking with all social conventions through
meditation, as he defined it.
   Through meditation, he said, his followers could destroy the
family, the church and the state, structures he said were
destroying humanity.
   He developed or synthesized several techniques, including one in
which followers jump up and down, yelling ``Hoo, hoo, hoo!''
   Unlike gurus who demanded that disciples reject worldly goods,
Rajneesh encouraged his followers to revel in sensual pleasures,
including sex, drugs and good food.
   ``Only by this way will you ever rise above them,'' he said in
one of his famous discourses, which he peppered with bathroom humor
and intriguing riddles.
   Those who succeeded in meditation, the guru said, would attain
``Buddhahood,'' or enlightenment; they would be able to live in the
world unaffected by its changes.
   ``What Osho taught is that the next jump for humanity is not
changing the shape of your nose or face, but changing the shape of
your inner space,'' said Swami Amrito, a British doctor who was
with Rajneesh when he died.
   Rajneesh returned to India in 1986 and problems followed the
movement home.
   After his death, the Indian press speculated that Rajneesh was
murdered or died of AIDS. His followers denied the claims and
accused the United States of poisoning their god while he was in
jail.
   Indian newspapers claimed Westerners were trying to seize
control of the movement. The commune also rejected that claim.
   A mysterious team of 21 people, called the ``Inner Circle,''
runs the commune. An American, Swami Jayesh, and the British
doctor, Swami Amrito, are believed to be in charge.
   Negative publicity has hurt donations, which routinely reached
millions of dollars a year.
   Swami Tatahgat, the Indian board member, said the commune did
not plan to expand its campus because ``we don't have the funds.''
Last year, the commune lost a court case and was forced to pay the
Indian government $2 million in back taxes.

   ``Be there or be square,'' says a Californian with pigs riding
surfboards on his shorts.
   The meeting of the White Robed Brotherhood is the centerpiece of
meditation at the commune. Every evening, hundreds of followers don
cotton robes and gather in the Gautama the Buddha Auditorium.
   Disciples pass a metal detector, then a duo of sniffing women
whose job it is to detect those who are wearing perfume or haven't
bathed.
   ``Osho doesn't like weird smells,'' says one olfactory guard.
Like other followers, she speaks of Rajneesh in the present tense.
   His empty chair sits on a marble stage between two air
conditioners set at 52 degrees Fahrenheit, his preferred
temperature.
   A screen drops and a video of the master is shown.
   As the discourse ends, a young Frenchwoman whispers: ``He is
still with us.''

   Spring came for Alfredo Mustelier on March 21.
After two decades as a prisoner, he was free.
   Free  prison uniform, meaning he had to live in his undershorts.
   Prisoners like Mustelier who refuse the prison regimen are
called ``plantados,'' or steadfast ones. They once were many, but
Mustelier's release left only two.
   Frustration and hopelessness so overwhelmed Mustelier that he
took out his rage on his teeth, grinding them relentlessly. Some
were reduced to half their normal size.

   Enter Maria, a doctor in Havana, who was a 28-year-old widow in
1985.
   A cousin of Mustelier, who lived in Miami, was Maria's close
friend. The cousin asked her to write Mustelier, because no one
else did, and to mail him reading material and money for
incidentals.
   She agreed, never thinking the relationship would develop.
   ``He never thought about love,'' she said. ``He had had two
marriages that did not work out. He had this idea of dedication to
the fatherland, and he did not think about romance.
   ``I would write every week. He would say he looked at the world
through my eyes. I would tell him how things were on the street,
about fashion, what I saw on TV.
   ``The affection that developed between us was first a great and
powerful friendship, and later a love developed. ... I didn't think
he would fall in love with me through letters and, of course, when
he told me, I was in shock.''
   For much of their correspondence, he had never even seen her
photograph.
   Mustelier, who is white, did not know she was black, Maria said.
Racial issues intrude on personal relationships in Cuba, although
not nearly so much as in the United States.
   She tried twice to visit him in the prison at Santiago, 600
miles from Havana, but was turned away because she was not a close
relative.
   In the spring of 1987, Mustelier and some other inmates were
moved to a prison in the capital.
   She will never forget the day they met: June 12, 1987.
   Three months later, they were married in a two-hour prison
ceremony, with about 20 people in attendance. The wedding banquet
was ice cream, soda and snacks.
   After that, she could see him every 21 days.
   Each time, she said, ``Since early morning my heart was
pounding, because I knew I was going to see him.''
   Her husband knew she had no time to eat before the visits, so he
sometimes saved his meager lunch for her.
   ``He would bring me his lunch, his piece of chicken, his piece
of meat,'' she said.
   On one visit, two years ago, the male guards strip-searched
Maria and sexually abused her. Mustelier was enraged and refused to
eat for 19 days.
   In addition to the consequences of hunger strikes, Mustelier
said he suffers from the results of cruel treatment.
   Castro has claimed there never has been an instance of torture
in more than 31 years of the Cuban revolution, but here are some of
Mustelier's complaints:
   _For two years, he was held in a white cell with nothing but a
500-watt electric bulb. The constant glare made him nearsighted,
and the condition is becoming progressively worse.
   _Loud horns blown by guards to keep him from sleeping cost him
40 percent of his hearing.
   _His arms and legs bear the scars of bayonet attacks by guards,
and his jaw was broken once. Mustelier's legs still are inflamed
from the last hunger strike.
   He once was handcuffed to two other inmates and placed in a cell
six feet high, six long and three wide. If two of them lay
side-by-side, the third had to lie on top because of the handcuffs.
   After 24 hours, Mustelier managed to remove the handcuffs. The
guards threatened to put them back on, but he said: ``For you to
put the chains back on, you'll have to kill us.''
   An officer sided with the inmates and, although the three were
kept in the cell several more days, they were not handcuffed.
   Despite his prison ordeal, Mustelier looks surprisingly healthy,
perhaps younger than his 47 years. Seven weeks after ending his
last hunger strike, he has gained 40 pounds and worries about
becoming fat.
   If he is embittered, he doesn't show it. Laughter often
punctuates his stories of life in prison, even his description of
being overrun by roaches and mosquitos.
   ``We used to say they were the big allies of our jailers,'' he
said.
   Did he ever count the days during his 105-day hunger strike?
``No, because after counting them, you worry and this weighs on
you,'' he said, and laughed again.
   Yoga and an hour of physical exercise every day helped Mustelier
endure the long confinement. Like Maria, he found comfort in
religion.
   In his last hunger strike, his rosary was always with him.
   He showed a visitor a book of religious verses he had since
1988. Despite daily use, it was nearly in mint condition.
   He opened the book with great care, not touching the pages
beyond the margins.
   ``Every verse filled me with peace and tranquillity,'' he said.
   Mustelier wrote love poems to Maria, whom he calls Caruca, and
gave her a collection of them in September for their second wedding
anniversary.
   One, translated from the Spanish, reads:
   ``Your appearance produces not only happiness, but joy.
Happiness is a momentary state of emotion, joy is a state of
satisfaction and deep feeling. With that, I will look upon you as a
gift of spring.''

   When Nissan was ready to market a luxury car, it
wanted a name and a symbol that meant something on both sides of
the world, conveyed its quality and bridged language barriers.
After months of consultation, the name Infiniti and its symbol _ an
unbroken line incorporating a peak _ emerged.
   When American Can decided its name no longer fit the character
and breadth of its financial services and specialty retailing
business, it searched for a new one. It ultimately became
Primerica, with a logotype characterized by two merging typefaces
that mirror the company's diversity.
   Both companies used corporate identity consultants to analyze
and execute the changes.
   Naming names has become vital business in the era of mergers and
global expansion, and many companies are using these specialists to
help them establish, or re-establish, their persona in the
marketplace.
   ``It has achieved a level of recognition that it never had
before,'' says Clive Chajet, chairman and chief executive officer
of Lippincott &amp; Margulies, probably the leading corporate identity
firm and the one which created the Infiniti and Primerica names.
   He says the growing field is lucrative for people who have a
curious blend of qualifications: Intellectual discipline,
creativity, hard-nosed business sense, diplomatic skills,
seasoning, and patience. They might find places at L&amp;M or its
competitors, which include Anspach Grossman Portugal, Inc., Landor
Associates, and Siegal &amp; Gale. Identity specialists are found on
many corporate staffs as well.
   Corporate identity people get involved in such diverse functions
as naming or branding, logotypes and print design, market analyses
and research, mission statements, and overall strategy. Chajet sums
it up as ``creative, intellectually strategic planning.''
   The mission, he says, is to define an identity that conveys what
kind of company it is to work for, what its place in the market is,
and its value in the stock market. ``You don't do this simply
because the company wants to decorate itself.''
   Field professionals fall into three main categories, usually
working in concert: consultants, designers, and ``name'' people.
   ``A name person is a very special breed of person,'' Chajet
says. ``These are people who love words, who love to sit around and
dream up names.'' The challenge may be to put a great deal of
meaning and information into one simple word. Most companies today
need names that are internationally recognizable. Names also must
be available for copyright _ not a small problem, since 80,000 new
names are registered each year.
   Then there is the designer, who may work primarily with
typography but whose duties will extend to laying down usage
formulas for logotypes, stationery, publications or product
branding. ``Our designers have to succeed in a very narrow graphic
area. The type may be limited, but it has a major affect on the
design itself.''
   And the omniscient consultant: ``He is well educated. He is a
good strategist, and he knows how to link what we do to general
business. He is sophisticated. He has to have patience and the
ability to deal with a lot of clients. If he has these qualities,
he will be at home here.'' The consultant is at the forefront of
analyzing a company's mission and conception problems in context of
its position in the marketplace. Often he will be involved in
drawing up internal mission and position statements that clarify
these for the company.
   There aren't any schools of corporate identity, and except for
designers, staff members usually come in after seasoning elsewhere
_ marketing, advertising, financial writing, and other fields. The
late Walter Margulies, co-founder of the firm, was an architect.
   One of the main attractions of the work is its stimulation,
Chajet says. ``The diversity of business you get involved with
gives you a buzz. You`re dealing only with the top level of
management. The level of your colleagues is high. You have a
sophisticated lifestyle. The subject matter _ thinking of and
shaping images _ is a fascinating subject. I call that a big buzz.''
   Steve Lawrence, vice president of account services at the firm,
agrees. ``We don't have any dog days here. The high level of work
is constant. There aren't any formulas, and each problem needs an
individual solution. The ultimate satisfaction is to provide a
solution that lasts for a long time.''
   ``The variety lets me `change jobs' every few months,'' adds
Vice President Kate Moran, whose specialty is names and brands. She
says she gets a thrill when she sees the results of her work as she
travels _ like an automobile or a company name she helped create.
   
   Design Services Director Connie Birdsall, who recently came up
with a new healthcare symbol for Bausch &amp; Lomb products, says she
likes the ``wonderful problem solving'' and creating permanent
designs.
   The material rewards are good, too, according to Chajet. Though
he won't put a dollar figure on any of the jobs, he says
professionals can earn a ``nice living,'' and salaries are
competitive with those in top-line advertising and design firms.
   Unlike some of those firms, who may lay off large parts of their
staffs when they lose accounts, the identity field is stable.
   ``Our stability for the last eight years has been absolutely
frightening.''

   A shortage of engineers and scientists has educators and
potential employers aggressively courting women and minorities.
   ``We need to funnel our brightest students _ including women and
minorities _ into science and engineering, to remain competitive
economically on an international scale,'' says Dr. Harold J.
Raveche, president of Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken,
N.J.
   A shortfall of 400,000 recipients of bachelor of science degrees
and 27,000 of doctorates by the year 2000 has been projected by the
Hudson Institute in its ``Workforce 2000'' report. The squeeze is
being intensified by competition from countries like Japan and West
Germany, which have about twice as many engineers per capita as the
United States, according to a Battelle Memorial Institute study.
   Cornell University, for one, has initiated two new programs to
find and encourage black high school students and minority college
freshmen to pursue science and engineering careers. ``Too many
people have accepted the idea that there's no pool from which to
train the black engineers of the future,'' says Judy Jackson,
assistant dean of engineering for minority programs. ``We said
that's ridiculous. We went aggressively into five high schools, and
we asked guidance counselors for kids with aptitude. We talked to
every kid who had the potential and chose those who also had the
desire to reach their potential. Then we talked to their parents.''
   Little progress has been made in increasing the number of women
in science and engineering, says Dr. Jane Butler Kahle, professor
of teacher education at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, who has
been studying the problems of women in the profession. She thinks
the reasons include lack of role models, a male bias in science,
and inequities in the workplace.
   Only 14 percent of the country's scientists and engineers are
women, about the same proportion as 25 years ago, she says. Not
only are their enrollment rates lower, but the attrition rates are
higher. The few who manage to get their degrees and move into the
workforce face lower pay, slower promotion, less visibility and
fewer rewards at work.
   Armed with a grant from the National Science Foundation, Kahle
investigated high schools around the country to see what they did
to motivate girls to continue science studies. ``I was tired of
teacher bashing. I wanted to go in and find out what a good teacher
did.''
   What she found was that relatively inexpensive changes _
attractive classrooms with plants and animals, non-sexist language,
stress on the creativity in science, and career advice _
contributed to increased interest not only from girls but boys as
well. ``This was true even in the inner-city school, where the room
was like an island. It was just very attractive, even though all
the blinds were ripped and some of the glass was shattered.''
   Raveche agrees that a less sterile image of science will help.
``We've got to convey the sense of fun and excitement _ and the
relevance _ of science.'' He adds that high schools and colleges
need to improve the image and professionalism of math and science
teachers. ``Our society has created a stereotype of the scientist
as a nerd, complete with calculator and pocket protector.''
   Girls should be encouraged not only because the economy will
need them but because they will benefit themselves, Kahle says. ``I
explain to parents that we aren't in the schools because we think
their daughters should be Ph.D. scientists but because we think
it's better to earn $10 an hour as a technician rather than $3 an
hour as a beautician.''

   Polymer engineering, completely unknown two decades ago, is a
new field for science and engineering graduates.
   ``I get lots of of job descriptions for polymer engineers. I
wish I could fill all the requests I get,'' says Ruth Walton, who
directs career services at Stevens Institute of Technology in
Hoboken, N.J. Stevens is one of the few American colleges that
teaches polymer engineering, a field growing because of development
of high-performance plastics with new uses in manufacturing,
construction, and medicine.
   Plastics are beginning to be rated as highly as steel, glass and
ceramics as an engineering material, says Costas Gogos, chemical
engineering professor at Stevens and new initiatives director of
its Polymer Processing Institute. And in medicine, polymers are
useful because they are inert, meaning they do not interact with
the body. That makes them good for implants and intravenous feeding
devices, he says.
   Stevens' placement council estimates that the median starting
salary after college for chemical engineers, including polymer
specialists, at $34,699. _
   The waste-management crisis has created a shortage of trained
environmental and waste-management engineers, according to a
Cornell University survey of consulting firms in the United States
and Canada.
   ``Almost all the 51 firms we surveyed project new employment
opportunities for environmental and waste-management engineers,''
says Kate Skelton, research director for the Cornell Waste
Management Institute. ``The number of students preparing to enter
the field of waste management is far from sufficient to meet
current and future demands.''
   Waste-management engineers oversee plans and strategies for
dealing with solid, municipal, industrial, hazardous, agricultural,
sewage and radioactive wastes. These include design, siting,
monitoring and construction of handling facilities.
   While the firms say that 60 percent of their new hires in the
past two years have had bachelor's degrees, most want future
employees to have master's degrees. Average starting salaries were
$27,518 for the former and $30,403 for the latter. Salaries are
highest in the Northeast and lowest in the Southwest and Midwest.
   Skelton says that the demand may even be higher than the survey
shows. ``We polled only established consulting firms that have
already carved out their stable share of the market, and we know we
are missing the many new firms entering the field of waste
management and environmental engineering.'' _
   Another field with shortages is nuclear pharmacy, for dealing
with radiopharmaceuticals and radioactive drugs used in diagnosing
diseases like heart conditions and cancer.
   Limited resources and a lack of qualified teachers have made it
difficult to start programs in this specialty, says Stan Shaw,
professor of nuclear pharmacy at Purdue University in West
Lafayette, Ind. Other schools with programs are Massachusetts
College of Pharmacy, Mercer School of Pharmacy, Temple University,
University of Kentucky, and University of New Mexico.
   ``If the student can make it through the college program and has
genuine interest in nuclear pharmacy, he or she should have no
problem finding a job,'' says Steve Piepenbrink, a nuclear
pharmacist at Syncor International Co. in Indianapolis. ``At
Syncor, there are at least 20 positions open throughout the company
on an ongoing basis, a problem faced by nuclear pharmacies
nationwide.''
   These drugs are only occasionally used for therapy, he says. The
primary use is diagnostic. Usually the drug is injected
intravenously into the patient and absorbed into the organ or
tissue under observation. Radioactive atoms decay and emit
radiation that is detected by a gamma camera. The drug will appear
as excessive or small amounts of radioactivity in the tissue or
organ, alerting a doctor to the possibility of disease.
   The field will continue to grow, says Shaw. ``There are many new
radiopharmaceuticals for diagnosis and therapy being developed, and
there will be a bigger challenge to develop resources needed to
educate students.''

   Intensified recruitment, special programs, and higher salaries
are being put to work as shortages in nursing and healthcare
specialties continue.
   There were 1.6 million registered nurses in 1988, according to a
report recently sent to Congress by Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan. But the Association of Academic Health
Centers, representing about 100 major health complexes in the
United States, estimates that an additional 137,000 new nurses are
needed to fill current vacancies in hospitals and nursing homes.
   A recent salary survey by Working Woman Magazine puts the
national pay average for nurses at between $37,000 and $40,000.
Pace University in New York says the starting salary in the
metropolitan area is $35,000.
   Pace's Leinhard School of Nursing in Westchester County and New
York City says it is launching an all-out effort to find and train
new nurses, recruiting not only in high schools but in other
disciplines and careers. One of its programs is nursing summer camp
for promising high school candidates in Westchester. Another
project, in cooperation with a group of New York City schools,
enables hospital workers to upgrade their careers through nursing
education. Lienhard also has a combined degree program that lets a
degree holder in one field complete requirements for an initial
nursing degree in as little as a year.
   Other healthcare specialties experiencing shortages include:
   _ Laboratory technicians. Dr. Betty Hatten, chairman of the
University of Oklahoma's Clinical Laboratory Sciences Department,
cites a survey that shows that 9.3 percent of medical technologist
and 13.6 percent of cytotechnologist positions across the country
are vacant.
   She says low enrollments, overwork, burnout, and low salary
growth are among the causes. In cytotechnology (analysis of cells
to diagnose cancer and other diseases), technicians are restricted
by new federal rules on how many slides they are allowed to review
in one day.
   _ Genetic counselors. According to a representative of Sarah
Lawrence College, there are only 950 genetic counselors certified
by the American Board of Medical Genetics, more than half of whom
received their training at the Bronxville, N.Y., college.
   These specialists are involved in screening and diagnosis of
such disorders as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy,
neurofibromatosis, or cranio-facial disorders. They also work with
families to adjust to the impact of these conditions.
   Sarah Lawrence was the first school in the nation, in 1969, to
establish a master's level program in genetic counseling. It has
established affiliations with more than 30 medical and research
centers in the metropolitan New York area. The college says field
work placement with leading researchers at area institutions is
readily available for students with research interests.
   _ Optometrists. Optometry schools reported only 1,881 applicants
for 1,214 spaces in 1989, compared to 2,022 applicants for 1,196
spaces the previous year, according to the American Optometric
Association.
   AOA says the country needs more and more optometrists as the
population ages, but there are fewer seeking a career in the field.
   Doctors of optometry are state-licensed to diagnose and treat
vision conditions and eye disorders. They prescribe glasses,
contact lenses, special optical devices and, in some states, drugs
to treat certain eye diseases. Specializations within the
profession include contact lenses, vision therapy, pediatric or
geriatric optometry.
   AOA says optometrists averaged net incomes of $66,000 in 1988,
with an average of more than $40,000 during their first full year
of practice. _
   Support staffs, in contrast to healthcare specialists, are being
cut by many hospitals and institutions because of consolidation and
tighter reimbursement restrictions.
   ``As a result, innumerable administrative jobs in clerical,
purchasing and accounting are being automatically eliminated,''
says Angelo M. Troisi of Lee Hecht Harrison, Inc., a Boston-based
outplacement firm. He predicts the cutbacks will continue for at
least five years.
   He says that vulnerable healthcare workers should consider
relocating to urban areas where healthcare needs are greater or
even changing to other fields. ``Already we see a growing number of
higher-level administrators moving out of healthcare,'' he says.

   Law school graduates face a dilemma: which is the better career
path, small firm or large firm?
   The answer pretty much lies within the ``comfort zone'' of each
individual, but among those touting the small firm is Dean Booth,
senior partner of Booth, Wade and Campbell _ a small firm based in
Atlanta.
   ``In a small firm, the young lawyer has an opportunity to work
directly with the partners. If he or she is very good, that quality
will easily be recognized,'' says Booth. ``In large firms, that
contact is not easily accessible and young lawyers often need a
`mentor' in the firm to guide their path to partnership.''
   Booth believes that lawyers in smaller firms are often required
to engage in a variety of tasks and have more opportunity to
practice litigation.
   Advantages often cited for larger firms include security and
salary.
   Richard Zeif, a partner in the small law firm of Nierenberg,
Zeif and Weinstein in New York, says he advised his son to seek out
a large law firm. ``I think his future is more secure with a larger
firm,'' he says.
   Booth says the failure rate for large and small firms is about
the same, less than 5 percent each year, and financial compensation
is now comparable.

   The need for skilled designers who understand
design, production and marketing of toys and games has spawned the
first toy design degree program in the United States.
   The Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City is offering
its first classes toward a toy design degree this fall, backed with
the resources of the industry trade group, the Toy Manufacturers of
America.
   With annual retail sales of $12.5 billion, American toy
manufacturers are targeting development of talent in the field for
the next five years, according to TMA. The industry currently
employs about 50,000 people.
   F.I.T. says the curriculum will emphasize conceptual and
technical design development, knowledge of safety and regulatory
requirements, child psychology, production, packaging, and
marketing. Internships among the 250 American toy and games
companies will be part of the program.

   The hotel and motel industry is a growing industry in need of
help.
   ``There are simply not enough people to meet the requirements of
a constantly expanding industry,'' says Roger Saunders, president
of the American Hotel and Motel Association.
   ``Young people will find abundant openings as never before, in
administration, computer technology, food and beverage, sales, room
management, housekeeping, accounting _ you name it,'' says
Saunders, who is also chairman and chief executive officer of the
Saunders Hotels Co., Boston.
   Saunders says the travel business is now the nation's second
biggest employer and ``in just 10 years, by the turn of the
century, travel will be the nation's No. 1 employer, with one out
of every seven people in the work force.''
   He advises young people considering a career to look into hotel
schools to prepare for the business.
   But it is not a career only for young people, he says. ``There
are excellent income potentials for students and mothers of young
children, or women whose children are grown. The same is true for
senior citizens who want to work _ whether 50, 60 or over 70. They
are reliable, dependable workers and serve as role models for young
people.
   ``The same is true for the handicapped who can and want to
work.''

   The graying of America and the growth of two-career families has
brought renewed momentum to the direct selling industry _
traditionally called door-to-door sales _ according to specialists
in the field.
   ``The trend toward nesting by `baby boomers' is giving the
industry its greatest boost,'' says Elizabeth Doherty, a
spokeswomen for the Direct Sales Association, an industry trade
group.
   ``These nesters, now in their 30s and 40s, are settling down to
raise their children and are looking to create a healthier balance
between family and work.''
   Early retirees also are returning to the work force, seeking
extra income to supplement fixed pensions and Social Security.
   According to the trade group, there was a decline in the
nationwide number of direct sales representatives in the mid-80s,
but in recent years the trend has been reversed to the point where
it now is a $9.7 billion industry employing some 4 million full-and
part-time sales representatives.
   John Naisbitt, author of ``Megatrends 2000,'' says women are
expected to take two-thirds of all new jobs created in the '90s,
and of these women mothers will make up the largest percentage.
   According to Ms. Doherty, the association estimates that 80
percent of direct sales representatives work part time, and 80
percent of the industry is comprised of women.
   ``Because of its time flexibility, direct selling has
historically proven to be a popular career choice with mothers and
others seeking part-time work,'' she says.

   Here are highlights of opportunities in a variety of fields:
   The CIO, or chief information officer, is gaining visibility as
a senior executive in many corporations, says a search consultant
who specializes in the field.
   ``While some skepticism persists, the `CIO' idea _ a senior
executive by whatever title in charge of technology on a par with
the CFO and other top-level executives _ is no longer a novelty,''
says John J. Davis, who runs an executive search firm in New York
City.
   Davis estimates that better than half of the 100 largest
technologically-driven corporations have a CIO. This executive is
less a technology expert than a business leader who manages
information technology as an offensive and defensive weapon in a
company's fight to survive in global markets, he says.
   ``The position has real teeth, real substance.'' _
   The person who plans and manages office environments represents
a new professional specialty: facilities management.
   Responsibilities include long-range planning and budgeting, real
estate acquisition and disposal, planning of interior space,
architectural and engineering planning, new construction or
renovation, maintenance and operations management, integrating
communications systems, and general administrative services, like
food services, reprographics, and transportation.
   According to the International Facility Management Association,
based in Houston and currently claiming 8,700 members, entry level
salaries average $20,000-$30,000, depending on position, company
size and geographic location. The organization says that 22
colleges offer programs in this area, among them Cornell
University, Iona College, North Dakota State University and Brigham
Young University. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology offers
several courses and hosts a conference each year. _
   The corporate real estate management field has become central to
corporate strategy planning, industry observers note.
   Specialists, once just caretakers of company holdings, must now
deal with large plant investment decisions that call for knowledge
of corporate needs, government regulations, tax structures, cost
factors and worldwide site location criteria, according to the
Industrial Development Research Council, an association of Fortune
500 corporate real estate professionals.
   Corporations are placing heavier emphasis on the recruitment of
specialists who are seasoned in finance, foreign and domestic
deal-making, and strategic thinking, according to the council. _
   Employment opportunities are excellent for college business
graduates who specialize in accounting, according to the personnel
director of one of the nation's largest independent regional
accounting firms.
   ``With the general disenchantment on Wall Street,
business-minded individuals looking for great career opportunities
should seriously consider accounting,'' says Rick Fisher of Richard
A. Eisner &amp; Co., a New York-based firm.
   Although auditing services will always be the backbone of the
accounting industry, Fisher says, individuals can expect to see
opportunities in the areas of litigation support, bankruptcy,
divorce and white collar crime.
   According to the American Institute for Certified Public
Accountants, the earnings potential of a CPA is excellent, with
starting salaries as high as $33,000 _ depending on the size of the
firm, the company and the geographical location. _
   Women are making inroads into the life insurance business,
according to a spokesman for Northwestern Mutual Life, where one of
10 sales agents are women.
   ``The lure in this once-male-dominated field is the right mix of
financial reward and flexibility,'' says John Caspari of the firm's
communications department. He says the trend for more women in
sales ranks will continue. Advanced degrees and prior experience,
while helpful, are not a prerequisite, he adds. _
   Job opportunities in the welding field are being upgraded by a
new certification program providing recognition of welders who have
demonstrated their competence, according to the American Welding
Society.
   The program improves career mobility for welders with
certification that travels with the individual, explains Richard
Alley, president of the society.
   ``The Bureau of Labor Statistics tells us that we must maintain
the welder workforce at about 420,000 into the 21st century. So AWS
developed the welder certification program to provide personal
credentials that stay with individuals wherever they may want to
work, similar to those available in many other occupations,'' he
says.
   ``While industry is losing 25 percent of its welders every year
due to normal attrition _ nearly 100,000 annually _ we have only
about 35,000 students in secondary education taking welding courses
today,'' he adds. _
   Many retirees and housewives are choosing second careers as
school bus drivers, says a spokesman for Miami-based Ryder Student
Transportation Services.
   More than 50 percent of Ryder's 7,500 drivers are women, many of
them mothers of school age children attracted by schedules and
vacations that coincide with their children's, according to
Jonathan Ward.
   ``Some even drive their own children to school,'' he adds.
   Another source of school bus drivers is retirees, Ward notes.
   ``Like housewives, retirees are drawn to school bus driving by
the opportunity to work with children and by the flexible work
schedules _ two shifts of three hours each in the morning and
afternoon,'' he says.
   Ryder transports some 400,000 students each school day in more
than 7,000 buses in 15 states.

   Second quarter hiring will be somewhat softer than the same
period last year, according to a survey by Manpower, Inc., the
international temporary services firm.
   Among businesses surveyed, 26 percent plan to add staff during
the April-May-June period, a drop from last year's 30 percent.
Decreases in staff are projected in 8 percent of the companies, up
from last year's 6 percent. Percentages are based on responses from
a quarterly survey from among the 15,000 public and private
employers surveyed by Manpower.
   The weakness shows up in the slow pickup in hiring plans from
the first to second quarter of this year, says Mitchell S.
Fromstein, the firm's president. ``We usually see a drop in hiring
in January after the holiday period, which is followed by a sharp
increase in the second quarter. The pickup is there this year, but
the usual eight-point increase is down to six points.
   ``These lower hiring projections are still above normal
recession levels.''
   Sharp declines from a year ago in the Northeast is largely
responsible for the downward trend, according to the survey. Stable
hiring is forecast for the South and Midwest, and hiring
projections for the West are marginally higher than they were for
last year.
   The downtrend is most noticeable in manufacturing; both durable
and non-durable goods manufacturers project sharp declines in
hiring. Construction and service sectors continue to show
above-average growth, while wholesale and retail trades are near
the all-industry average.

   Because of a shrinking labor pool, workers in the
year 2000 will be in a better position to realize workplace demands
such as better environments, continuing education, extensive
benefits packages, and shorter work schedules.
   That's the picture that emerges from a survey of 1,300 business
people in eight countries conducted by Priority Management System
Inc., a management training firm.
   ``By the end of this decade, taking time off will become more
important than making more money,'' says Dan Stamp, the firm's
president.
   The survey report, called ``The 21st Century Workplace,'' shows
that employees want to change or escape from pressures of today's
workplace: 95 percent of respondents work more than 40 hours a
week; 49 percent took two weeks or less in vacation time during the
past year; 36 percent lack adequate skills to operate a computer or
other high-tech equipment; and 66 percent feel their jobs are more
stressful than they were a decade ago.
   When asked what would make them happier, most respondents said
they wanted more time with family, good health, job challenges and
opportunity, and that these benefits ranked ahead of making more
money.
   ``Businesses will have to be sensitive to the altering
complexion of employee needs if they are going to attract and
retain qualified personnel,'' concludes Stamp.

   A new quirk in corporate hiring is the interim
executive, according to John A. Thompson, chairman of the Interim
Management Corp.
   Thompson says many corporations are using executive temps to
solve their short-term problems.
   ``They serve as chief executive officer, chief financial
officer, comptroller, chief loan officer, marketing manager and any
other executive category in which there is an immediate need,'' he
says.
   ``An interim management strategy allows a company to meet
challenges without padding its permanent team or draining its
resources. It's not a stopgap measure. It's a sound low-risk
strategy that any organization can use to ensure versatility and
depth.''
   Most interim managers, he says, are not out-of-work executives
but ``people who have achieved a degree of financial independence
and prefer short-term assignments rather than permanent corporate
positions.''
   Thompson's company, which specializes in supplying high-level
executives on a temporary basis to industry and the non-profit
sector, offers this list of questions for potential interim
executives:
   _ Have you held a high-level management position for at least 10
years?
   _ Do you prefer to use your expertise in a wide variety of
situations?
   _ Are you a quick learner?
   _ Are you a self-starter who needs a minimum of supervision?
   _ Do you enjoy working in situations where the objectives are
relatively short-term and well defined?
   _ Are you comfortable with not knowing where you will be working
in six months?

   College students may discover that the best way to find a job
after graduation is to find a job during college, through
internships.
   ``An internship is often the answer to more questions than most
students even realize they have,'' says Barbara Yanowski, faculty
member and advisor to the internship program at Columbia College in
Chicago.
   She says virtually every department in the liberal arts school
at Columbia has a formal internship program, with more than 160
Chicago area employers participating.
   ``Of course, the most important question is, `Will I get a job
after college?' But there are other questions as well,'' she says.
```What do I want to do? Where do I want to work? Am I taking the
right classes?' An internship program helps students gain a
perspective on who they are and what they want, in school and out.''
   Working with professionals in the field helps students focus on
their career goals and objectives, says Yanowski. ``It's hard to
know what you want to do if you've never done it before. Students
not only learn from co-workers about their given field of interest,
they also benefit from the advice, guidance, and experience of
people who've been in their position before. And there's the added
plus of great networking opportunities for the future.''
   Ed Andrzejewski, a television major at Columbia, served an
internship in the audio-visual department at the Harris Bank in
Chicago.
   ``My internship here is giving me the chance to apply what I've
learned in school to a profession. I'm using advanced equipment,
actually making training videos, getting involved in everything
from editing to pre- and post-production,'' he says.
   At the bank, Charles Perkins, an assistant vice president who
frequently hires interns, says, ``I look for an intern who can work
well under pressure _ someone who is bright, aggressive, and a
self-initiator who can solve problems and adapt to his environment.
Here, we need someone who can communicate effectively and adapt to
almost any situation.''
   David Monk, an in-house producer and employer of interns at
Marshall Field &amp; Co. in Chicago, says, ``Internships provide a
great opportunity for students to see if they'd enjoy a particular
kind of work environment. ... An internship is the best way to find
out what makes you happiest.''
   From a business point of view, he says, ``Not only does the
intern provide an extra pair of hands, but an enthusiasm and
excitement that motivates everyone.''
   Yanowski says many colleges have formal internship programs like
Columbia's, and many others have job boards where opportunities are
listed. She also recommends the alumni office, which often lists
alumni and their present occupation.
   The library is also a good resource, she says, for annual
reports, the Dun &amp; Bradstreet directory, Chamber of Commerce
publications, and Thomas' Register of American Manufacturers, all
ways to learn about different industries and specific companies.

   Jay Leventhal is your best bet if you are blind
or visually impaired and need information about techniques for
successfully functioning on the job or on the job hunt.
   Leventhal is a resource specialist for the American Foundation
for the Blind and runs its Careers and Technology Information Bank,
maintaining a data base packed with information about assistive
devices and techniques that will help blind or visually impaired
employees get and maintain jobs in more than 250 occupations,
ranging from graphic arts to youth care.
   Using a computer with synthetic speech output and a
braillewriter, Leventhal, who is blind, has conducted more than
1,100 personal interviews with blind employees or jobseekers over
the last three years, garnering and exchanging information about
their experiences.
   ``Basically, I'm trying to find out what jobs visually impaired
people are doing and what equipment they're using to do their
jobs,'' he says. His files include information relevant to nursing,
graphic arts, engineering, investment services, journalism, and
scores of other fields. He also has a list of adaptive equipment _
from cassette recorders to closed-circuit televisions _ that can be
used in a variety of jobs. The caller who wants this information
also will get a list of vendors and resource people, usually others
in the same field. That way, the blind person can get information
and advice from those who've already coped with workplace problems
in that particular field.
   Leventhal says the database also helps dispel employers'
misconceptions about what blind employees can do. Rehabilitation
counselors have used the information to prove to them that blind
and visually impaired people can work in every major field.
   Assistive technology has greatly improved in the last decade, he
says. As a psychology major at Syracuse University, he used a
braillewriter, cassette recorder, slate and stylus, volunteer
readers, and a typewriter. ``Shortly after I graduated, everyone
started using computers. Now visually impaired students have a wide
variety of high-tech devices from which to choose.''

   Taking time out to raise children did not
affect the earnings of Barnard College's class of 1945, according
to a survey conducted by Edith U. Fierst, a member of the class, a
Washington attorney, and mother of three.
   ``The years out of the labor force do not appear to have had a
major impact on final earnings,'' she says. ``Those within a given
occupation tended to end up in the same bracket whether or not they
had taken time out for children.''
   Fierst's survey covered 75 class members, or a third of her
class at Barnard, a liberal arts college in New York City
affiliated with Columbia University. Of the group, 80 percent said
they had held paying jobs and almost all of the group who had
children took time out to care for them before returning to work.
   One of the things Fierst discovered in her survey was that,
contrary to conventional wisdom, the women didn't find full-time
motherhood boring or depressing. Instead, they said it was ``happy,
fulfilling and joyous.'' Most of the respondents said they believe
staying home with the children was the right thing to do.

   Clenching muscles, dizziness, back pain,
fatigue, eating disorders and substance abuse all can be symptoms
of stress on the job.
   But there are ways to ``de-stress,'' says Wendy Reid Crisp,
executive director of the National Association for Female
Executives.
   Because stress can cause muscles to tighten, Crisp suggests a
daily exercise routine, such as taking a walk or doing some
stretching. ``Light exercise can help loosen these muscles, making
you feel more relaxed,'' she advises.
   Drawing from her own experience and that of others, she
recommends looking at your work area to reduce or eliminate
stressors.
   ``Sometimes there are factors in the office that can contribute
to a stressful environment,'' she notes.
   ``Working under bright fluorescent lights can cause dizziness or
disrupt your concentration. An uncomfortable room temperature can
make you feel fatigued and sluggish. Try using a desk lamp instead
of fluorescent overhead lights.
   ``As for regulating the temperature, a portable fan or radiator
is a comfortable solution.''
   Taking a break outside for fresh air is another Crisp suggestion.
   ``At the end of a specific task _ whether it's an exhausting
meeting or writing a lengthy report _ take a mental break,'' she
says. ``It can be as simple as a walk around the block or making a
quick phone call to a friend. It will help clear your head and
mentally prepare you for what lies ahead.''
   Take one day at a time, she adds, and when it's time to go home,
``try to accept the fact that you can't solve all of your work
problems in one day and that there's no way to fix all job-related
problems after the work day is done.''

   The first day at a new job is much like
the first day of school: an exciting time, but an anxious one.
   What's the best way to approach it? Get right down to business?
Or watch your new boss and colleagues for a while to pick up cues
to the office culture?
   ``There's nothing wrong with showing eagerness to assume new
responsibilities,'' says James Case, director of the Career
Services and Placement Center at the University of Rochester. ``But
beginning a new job is a bit like moving to a foreign country.
There's a hidden culture that you've got to know.
   ``If you're a good observer, if you ask the right questions, and
if you're willing to adopt a style that meshes with those unwritten
rules that others seem to obey, then you'll probably be accepted.''
   Case says that among the things to pay attention to are the
dress code, the style in which others interact to get work done _
teamwork or solo efforts _ and the level of involvement the boss
prefers when an employee carries out an assignment.
   ``When people complain they've been victimized by `office
politics,''' says Case, ``they may have been discounted because
they clashed with the style or values of the workplace, whether by
choice or accident.''
   He advises, too, that you have a good idea of what is expected
of people in the job position before you even apply for it.
   `There's a world of difference between loving to play volleyball
and being a successful volleyball coach,'' he cites as an example.
``If you were thinking about becoming a coach, you'd be smart to
talk to some coaches about what they do, about what they like about
their jobs, and what they don't like. Then you could decide whether
you think you'd really enjoy the work.''
   Five key questions to ask the job holder, he says:
   1 _ How do you spend your time during a typical work week?
   2 _ What skills or talents are most essential to being effective
in your job?
   3 _ What are the toughest problems you face?
   4 _ What is most rewarding about the work itself, apart from
salary or fringe benefits?
   5 _ If you were ever to leave your job, what would drive you
away?

   As the saying goes, you never get a second chance to make a
first impression. So making a good one can be a vital key in your
quest for corporate success. How you look and how you communicate
during an interview can affect its outcome.
   Among contenders with equal qualifications, the candidate who
with the best communications skills is the one most likely to get
the job offer, says Barbara McEntee, a New York City communications
consultant whose clients include some of the country's top
companies. ``In fact, the ability to communicate well is ranked as
the number one key to success by leaders in business, politics and
the professions,'' she says.
   Job-seekers can say a great deal about themselves without
uttering a word, says Richard Press, grandson of the founder of J.
Press Clothiers.
   ``Without words, a properly-dressed applicant lets the
interviewer know he will fit into the `corporate culture' of a
company,'' says Press, whose male customers include leaders of
business and industry.
   How should a man dress for an interview?
   ``Conservatively,'' says Press, in a word. ``Most corporations
value a traditional approach to work and apparel.''
   Some of his recommendations for the job applicant:
   _ Suit: Navy blue or dark gray pinstripes, single breasted.
   _ Shirt: White, with spread or button-down collar (some
companies have a white-shirt-only policy).
   _ Tie: Ancient madder foulard or patterned silk (never wear a
striped tie with a pinstripe suit).
   _ Handkerchief for breast pocket: Optional (it should complement
but not match the tie).
   Socks: Navy blue or black over-the-calf.
   Shoes: Calfskin lace-ups, well polished.
   Press says clothes should be thought of as a career investment.
``If a suit is selected with care,'' he notes, ``it will last five
or more years without going out of style.''
   Both men and women should strive for the neat, tailored look, he
adds.
   Posture also is important in the job interview, according to
Linda Fields, an expert on body language and public speaking.
   ``Slouching sends a message you're insecure and nervous and
perhaps not capable of handling the job,'' says Ms. Fields, a
principal of New York-based Fields &amp; McKamy International Speaker
Services. Sitting on the edge of the chair will help you avoid the
slouch, she says.
   Both Ms. Fields and McEntee say the candidate should maintain
eye contact and appear confident.

   You're out of a job? Or don't like the one you have and have
that feeling it's time to move on? And you know that no one but you
is looking out for you? You're experiencing ``Career Shock,'' the
title of a book by James C. Cotham, III (Donald I. Fine, Inc.)
that's addressed to you. ``Do not be lulled into thinking good
things will automatically happen to you, especially if you press
your shoulder to the wheel, work hard, are nice to your boss, and
keep your nose clean,'' he writes. ``It just doesn't work that way
anymore. This is not a fairy tale. It's cold reality.'' Cotham
identifies the markers of career shock and gives practical advice
about coping and moving on. _
   Overviews of the employment outlook by career, industry and
region are covered in ``Jobs '90,'' by Kathryn and Ross Petras
(Prentice Hall). Short analyses and salary estimates are
interspersed with lists of resources, with addresses and phone
numbers of professional organizations and major employers
(including those where prospects are judged to be especially good
by the authors). _
   It's estimated that between 1 million and 2 million people in
this country earn their livings at home, with the help of personal
computers, fax machines and other electronics. ``The Telecommuter's
Handbook, or How to Work for a Salary Without Ever Leaving the
House,'' by Brad Schepp (Pharos Books) is aimed at anyone who wants
to join their ranks. The book covers how to get started, what kind
of jobs there are, and what companies are hiring employees who
seldom set foot in their offices. The author also takes a look at
the advantages and disadvantages and offers advice about how to set
up your office at home. _
   A pocket book reprint of ``Homebased Businesses'' (Fawcett
Books) by Beverly Neuer Feldman offers advice on how to find, plan
and promote a business at home. _
   You've probably heard of that business animal, the cash cow. But
do you know about the Four Tigers, the Hawthorne Effect, the
Invisible Hand or the Lumpy Demand? If you're already behind on
this brief quiz, you're ready for ``Managerial Literacy: What
Today's Managers Must Know to Succeed,'' by Gary Shaw and Jack
Weber (Dow Jones-Irwin). The authors, managerial consultants and
professors at the College of William and Mary and the University of
Virginia, respectively, say their book is the first to codify the
language managers and executives need to know to do their jobs.
(Answers: The Four Tigers are Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and
Korea, newly industrialized powers of the Pacific rim. The
Hawthorne Effect refers to how output relates to workers' feelings
about how they are valued by employers. The Invisible Hand recalls
Adam Smith's phrase in ``The Wealth of Nations,'' about
unintentional market forces that balance personal interest and
social gain in the economy. And the Lumpy Demand refers to wide
variations in demand, including seasonality and economic
instability.) _
   For the entry-level crowd, there's ``Real Life 101 _ Almost
Surviving Your First Year Out of College,'' by Susan Kleinman
(Master Media Limited). Since the author is only two years out of
college, she writes from fresh experience. This is really a book of
humorous essays, but it's sprinkled with genuine practical and
strategic advice to help the beginner adjust to business and
corporate culture. _
   ``Majoring in the Rest of Your Life'' (The Noonday Press) by
Carol Carter is aimed at teen-agers, high school graduates and
college freshmen. Currently assistant vice president and director
of college marketing for Prentice Hall publishers, she offers some
practical and sensible suggestions for developing ``life skills''
and making career goals based on personal interests and strengths. _
   A perennial manual for job-hunters and career-changers, ``What
Color Is Your Parachute'' (Ten Speed Press) is out in a 1990
edition marking its 20th anniversary. Author Richard Bolles
continues the systematic approach of previous editions, outlining
how to realize individual skills and find a job or new career.
There are hints and suggestions and referrals, with a new section
aimed at those with disabilities.
   Ten Speed Press also has revised and updated ``The Right Place
at the Right Time,'' first published in 1987. It gives an overview
of changes in the labor market and discusses individual skills and
interests, how to find out what specific jobs are like, the job
search and interview process. _
   ``Dream'' jobs are the subject of ``Jobs in Paradise'' (Harper
and Row) by Jeffrey Maltzman: teaching scuba diving in the Virgin
Islands, leading a singles tour through Europe, working at a
Colorado ski resort. The sourcebook is divided into snow and
skiing, beaches and coasts, islands, mountains, high adventure,
rivers and lakes, theme parks, deserts, tour and excursion leaders,
and cruise ships. _
   A revised edition of ``The Teenage Entrepreneur's Guide: 50
Money-Making Business Ideas,'' by Sarah Riehm (Surrey Books),
outlines for teens how to make money from their own enterprises _
house sitting, T-shirt art, garage cleaning or computer consulting
_ to avoid low-paying service jobs. _
   Random House breaks the job search down to specific cities in a
new series of soft-covers generically titled ``How to Be Happily
Employed in ... '' First four books cover San Francisco,
Washington, D.C., Boston and Dallas-Fort Worth. _

   Spare-time business opportunities can be full-time fun and
moneymakers, too, according to a new book, ``The 100 Best
Spare-Time Business Opportunities Today.''
   ``There are plenty of part-time business opportunities that not
only provide extra money but easily fit into your lifestyle,'' says
Kevin Harrington, co-author of the book with Mark Cohen. ``And
they're for people already employed and students, retirees and
homemakers.''
   More than 7 million Americans hold second jobs, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   Harrington says the first steps in choosing a spare-time
business career are akin to shopping: Can I afford it and do I like
it?
   A business opportunity shouldn't mean you have to drain your
life's savings or mortgage your house to meet necessary capital, he
says. ``You don't want to earn extra money at the risk of getting
yourself into serious debt.''
   The business also should be one that you like, is easy to learn
and simple to run, says Harrington.
   To help decide what is the best choice, he says, ask yourself
these questions:
   _ Would it be enjoyable in your spare time?
   _ Does it match your skills, training, experience, or education?
   _ Can it fit into your everyday schedule?
   _ Will it be here today and gone tomorrow?
   _ Does it suit your budget?

   Athletes who intend to compete in the Olympics at Barcelona and
Albertville two years from now have more than just their training
to think about. Because of training costs, time, and the fact that
they are older on average than earlier Olympians, they can't delay
planning post-athletic careers, according to Ernst &amp; Young, the
international professional services firm. The New York-based
company, in cooperation with the United States Olympic Committee,
has established the Olympic Job Opportunities Program, aimed at
helping at least 400 athletes find jobs that allow scheduling
flexibility and paid time away. They say they are looking for
employers across the country to pledge jobs for the athletes. _
   Don't send your resume to a prospective employer by fax without
his permission, says Adela Oliver, president of Oliver Human
Resource Consultants, Inc., a New York outplacement firm. She says
too many job hunters are tying up company lines, and executive
search firms aren't too pleased about it, either. ``An executive
who faxes a resume today without obtaining permission is
endangering his or her chances to get a job,'' she says. ``Many VPs
of Human Resources are enraged when this occurs.'' She says the
best way to connect to a new job is still networking, though
because of the current business climate, even the network is
overloaded and must be used with care. _
   Takeover turmoil has ended the idea that jobs in large
corporations are more secure than those in small companies, says
Larry Levine, partner of Gundersen Partners, a New York executive
search firm. ``With corporations merging left and right, entire
departments are disappearing in the blink of an eye. That a person
can work hard, keep his head low and retire with a pension is a
truism that has died in Drexelesque fashion.'' Levine says that
smaller entrepreneurial firms are better prepared to let employees
have the autonomy they need to guarantee their futures. ``That
loyalty is a two-way street usually is not lost on those running
smaller companies, many of whom are veterans of merger mania and
fully appreciate the human side of business.'' _
   A realistic picture of the work world will help you if you're on
your first serious job search since graduation, and getting
information may be simpler than you think, says Athena Constantine,
director of career services at Columbia University. Your parents'
friends, relatives, professors, neighbors and friends' parents are
good sources for a start. Then check with alumni of your college,
whose affiliations may be listed in directories or newsletters.
Work-study programs before you graduate, internships or summer jobs
before you graduate can help you get a sense of the job market. ``A
person without this experience, who approaches the job market for
the first time, might have an inflated sense of what is out
there,'' she cautions. _
   If you want your kid to grow up to be a driver, you might give
him or her a toy truck. Or a medical kit, if you're thinking of a
future doctor in the family. But what if you think your child
should grow up to be in business? The Busines$ Kit, distributed by
Busines$ Kids of Coral Gables, Fla., is aimed at teen-agers with an
entrepreneurial bent. It's packed with an audio cassette called
``The Buck Starts Here,'' five booklets about aspects of business
and how to start one; management and advertising plans; a datebook;
stationery amd business cards. The kit costs about $50. For more
information, call (800) 852-4544. _
   A series of videotape seminars on such subjects as sales,
personnel, and management is available from CareerTrack
Publications. Call (800) 334-1018 for a catalog or information.

   Former junk bond financier Michael Milken has
agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay $600 million in
penalties to settle the largest securities fraud case in history.
   The plea bargain disclosed Friday by sources is a stunning
reversal for Milken and caps negotiations between the government
and attorneys for the ex-head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s
high-yield bond department.
   Milken and Drexel were implicated by speculator Ivan Boesky, who
cooperated with the government in settling charges that he ran an
insider trading network. Boesky's disclosures implicated major
financial figures and shocked Wall Street in the 1980s.
   Milken is expected to enter the guilty plea to the felony counts
and agree to pay fines and restitution this week in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan, said individuals close to the case, who asked
not to be named.

<TEXT>
   New York was the nation's most expensive city
for business travelers in 1989, with an average daily tab of
$312.01, more than $50 higher than No. 2 Chicago, according to a
survey released today.
   The average daily cost of a hotel room, three meals and a car
rental in America's 100 most expensive cities for business
travelers was $159.42, virtually the same as in 1988, Corporate
Travel magazine said.
   The survey was conducted by the Rochester Institute of
Technology's graduate school of food, hotel and tourism management.
   The magazine said it obtained room prices from more than 4,000
hotels. About 600 of 1,200 hotels surveyed responded to questions
about meal costs at hotel restaurants, Corporate Travel said in its
April issue. Car rental costs were averaged from four big rental
agencies.
   New York led all categories, with average daily hotel room costs
of $162.78, food at $74.84 and car rental at $74.39. Chicago was
second with a total average of $255.77, followed by Boston,
$251.87; Washington, $226.16; and Newark, N.J., $218.39.
   Rounding out the top 10 were San Francisco, $207.22; Los
Angeles, $192.42; Dallas, $190.91; Baltimore, $185.84; and Detroit,
$185.40.
   Tallahassee, Fla., was the cheapest of the top 100 cities, with
an average total cost of $115.56. It was preceded by Biloxi, Miss.,
$119.82; Omaha, Neb., $123.82; and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., $125.55.
   The magazine said that hotel room costs rose 2.5 percent from
1988 to $66.27 a night. Food costs declined 17 percent overall to
$44.87, while the cost of renting a car increased 12 percent to
$49.51, the magazine said.

<HEAD>Economist Sees No Quick End To China's Economic Slump</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China's listless economy won't begin to recover
until the second half of the year, jeopardizing the nation's
industrial growth target, a government economist said Monday.
   Zhang Zhongji of the State Statistical Bureau told a news
conference that the economy had failed to respond to several
measures taken during the first quarter of the year.
   He said an infusion of $4.2 billion in loans for slumping
industries, double the amount for the same period of 1989, had
contributed mainly to further overstocking of unsold products.
   Zhang provided figures, most already released, showing zero
growth in industrial output value over the first quarter, with a
3.1 percent downturn in retail sales and sharp declines in the
production of durable consumer goods.
   He said austerity measures initiated in late 1988 to slow down
inflation and runaway economic growth had shown some positive
results. Retail prices were up only 3.9 percent from the previous
year, the lowest increase since 1988, energy production was up a
solid 6.7 percent, the trade balance was favorable and goods on the
marketplace were plentiful.
   ``But there has been no fundamental change in the slump of the
market, stagnation in industrial production and poor economic
efficiency,'' he said.
   Zhang predicted little economic growth in the second quarter. He
said the economy will only begin to recover in the second half of
the year.
   Reaching the government target of industrial growth of 5 percent
to 6 percent will be a ``very difficult and arduous task,'' he said.
   Zhang said the economic slump caused ``concern for many people''
but declined to characterize the situation as a recession. He said
it was ``not surprising to see some stagnation and even decline''
as the government tries to control inflation and adjust the
industrial structure.

<HEAD>Japan's Vehicle Production Down In March</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   TOKYO _ (AP) _ Domestic production of Japanese cars, trucks and
buses declined 2.8 percent in March from a year earlier, the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers Association reported Monday.
   But despite last month's drop, to 1.234 million units, overall
vehicle output during fiscal 1989 reached a record 12.954 million
units, up 1 percent from a year earlier, the group said.
   The previous record of 12.819 million units was set in fiscal
1988. The fiscal year ends March 31 in Japan.
   During March, sluggish truck and bus output hindered overall
production growth, while car production posted a steady 9.4 percent
increase over a year ago.
   Japanese manufacturers built a total of 910,687 passenger cars
in March. Output of trucks was down 26 percent at 319,763 units,
while production of buses was 3,975, down 18.4 percent.

   Avon Products Inc. on Monday reported its profit
more than doubled in the first quarter but sales were virtually
unchanged from a year earlier.
   The big beauty products company earned $15.2 million, or 11
cents a share, in the three months ended March 31, up from $6.2
million, or 5 cents a share, in 1989's first quarter.
   The domestic direct sales operation posted a 14 percent increase
in its pretax earnings, helped by cost reductions. The
international division also contributed to Avon's overall
profitability, showing a 17 percent gain in pretax earnings.
   Avon said in a news release that a small gain from the sale of
its Parfums Stern retail fragrance subsidiary was offset by
takeover defense costs.
   Companywide sales totaled $703.8 million in the first quarter,
down about one-tenth of a percentage point from $704.9 million the
year before.
   The sale of Parfums Stern reduced total revenue. Excluding the
subsidiary's contribution to last year's sales total, sales in this
year's first quarter were up 4 percent.

<HEAD>High Court Refuses To Block Trial For Oil Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to block an
Alaska state court trial of a lawsuit that accuses oil companies of
underpaying the state for oil leases.
   The justices, without comment, rejected arguments the oil
companies cannot get a fair trial in Alaska because all residents _
including judges and prospective jurors _ would share in any
additional money the firms could be ordered to pay.
   Alaska officials sued in 1983 seeking damages from 19 oil
producers who received state leases to mine the state's North Slope.
   The state said the companies underestimated the value of oil and
gas taken from Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk River fields.
   Three companies that are trying to kill the suit said $2.6
billion could be at stake, and that could translate into $70 a year
indefinitely for each state resident qualified to share in the
proceeds. The three companies are Standard Alaska Production Co.,
Exxon Corp. and Chevron, USA.
   A share of all oil royalties go into a special state fund
created so that Alaska residents can share in the state's mineral
wealth.
   About half the yearly income produced by the fund is distributed
to qualified residents in the form of dividends.
   The oil companies said the existence of the fund means it is
impossible to get an impartial judge and jury in Alaska to consider
the state's suit for additional payments.
   ``Every judge and juror in Alaska has an inherent bias,''
lawyers for the oil companies said, since a successful suit by the
state could put more money in their pockets.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year the
companies' bid to use the federal courts to block the state court
proceedings is premature.
   The appeals court said, even assuming that each state resident
stands to gain $70 a year from the suit, ``We do not have
sufficient facts before us to determine'' whether such a sum is ``a
substantial financial interest compelling disqualification'' of
judges and jurors.
   It is also possible that some judges and prospective jurors
would be willing to forgo any extra benefits from the suit, the
appeals court said.
   The case is BP Exploration vs. Baily, 89-1375.

<HEAD>Rig Count Drops By Two</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working U.S. oil and natural gas
rigs fell by two this week to total 932, Baker Hughes reported
Monday.
   The rig count has declined by three and nine, respectively, the
past two weeks. A year ago, the count was 767, Baker Hughes said.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rotary rigs actively
exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of
producing wells.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil-producing states, Texas and Oklahoma posted the
largest gain with six each, while Colorado gained one.
   California recorded the largest decline for the week with five,
followed by North Dakota, four; Louisiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania,
three each; Wyoming, two; and Michigan, one.
   Kansas and New Mexico remained unchanged from last week.

   The stock market showed another broad loss
today, picking up where it left off in last week's slide.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 55.85 points last
week, fell 23.20 to 2,672.75 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 4 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 226 up,
1,053 down and 481 unchanged.
   Analysts said fears of rising interest rates kept a dominant
hold on the mood among investors.
   A sharp rise in rates last week raised yields on long-term
government bonds close to 9 percent, their highest levels since
last May.
   As a new week began, predictions abounded of further increases
in rates, partly on the basis of signs that business activity had
picked up recently.
   Higher interest rates are seen as an increasingly significant
obstacle to hopes that corporate earnings might improve as the year
progresses.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eurotunnel said Monday it would raise up to $4.1
billion more from its banks and shareholders to finish its rail
tunnel under the English channel.
   The Anglo-French consortium said the cost of the 31-mile tunnel
has risen to up to $12.4 billion due to soaring construction and
borrowing costs. Only half the boring has been completed, the
company said.
   Last year, it said the project would cost $11.4 billion, and
three years the price tag was at $7.93 billion.
   The company said it would sell up to $815 million worth of new
shares to its existing shareholders after it completed talks with
its bankers about expanding credit facilities.
   Eurotunnel said it expected to increase funds available to the
project up to $13.8 billion from $11 billion.
   ``We are going to raise more than we need so we don't have to go
through this asking for extra finance exercise again,'' said
Eurotunnel Deputy Chairman Alastair Morton.
   Morton said that with the actual tunneling work half-finished,
he was confident the extra funds could be raised.
   Morton said tunneling progress has been satisfactory. ``We have
gone from having a third of the actual tunneling work completed to
having half of it done in just 16 weeks,'' he said.
   Eurotunnel's 208 banks already have put up $8.2 billion in
credit. Eurotunnel said that it would seek release of additional
funds from that credit line in June to cover operating expenses
while it negotiated terms on additional credit.
   The consortium blamed the increased costs primarily on added
expenses forecast by its main contractor Trans-Manche Link, which
cited inflation and the need to add workers to assure that the
project is completed by its June 1993 target.
   Eurotunnel also cited rising interest costs at a time of
increased borrowing.
   Some of the additional costs might be slightly offset by savings
from a cost-control agreement reached in January between Eurotunnel
and Trans-Manche Link, Eurotunnel said.
   The strained relations between the two over disputed costs
apparently have improved.
   Morton said: ``The relationship between the two companies was
always good at site-level. It's now good on the day-to-day project
level.''
   But Eurotunnel noted that it still was in dispute over some
costs with Trans-Manche.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Grain and soybean futures prices fell slightly in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Despite forecasts for rain in the western Corn Belt today and in
the central portion of the region by Wednesday, traders were
focusing on today's warm, dry conditions in Illinois, Indiana and
eastern Iowa, said John Frazier, director of agricultural commodity
trading for Gerald Inc.
   ``Right now the sun's shining,'' enabling farmers to get out in
their fields and plant crops, he said.
   Early losses were limited by reports that wet weather in Brazil
was forcing further delays in the South American soybean harvest.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were 1{ cents to 2\ cents
lower with the contract for delivery in May at $3.69{ a bushel;
corn was { cent to 1{ cents lower with May at $2.76{ a bushel; oats
were unchanged to 1{ cents lower with May at $1.56 a bushel;
soybeans were 1\ cents to 3} cents lower with May at $6.03{ a
bushel.
   Cattle futures were lower while pork futures were higher in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Traders were
reacting to Friday's Agriculture Department reports showing
larger-than-expected cattle supplies and smaller-than-expected
pork-belly stocks.
   Live cattle futures were unchanged to .47 cent lower with June
at 73.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent t .50 cent
lower with April at 83.87 cents a pound; hogs were .30 cent to .88
cent higher with June at 61.77 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .25 cent to 1.90 cents higher with May at 64.20 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mixed on Friday.

<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Co. announced Monday that its West
German subsidiary will launch a $140 million capital investment
program to meet rising demand for the soft drink in East Germany.
   The program by Coca-Cola GmbH will include upgraded machinery
for bottling and distribution operations, trucks, vending machines
and other sales equipment, the company said in a statement.
   Since mid-February, East Germans have been able to buy Coca-Cola
shipped in from the company's plants elsewhere in Europe. More than
2 million cases of the soft drink have been sold since then, the

   Under the new plan, Coca-Cola would be bottled in East Berlin

   The stock market sustained a broad loss today,
once again yielding to interest-rate and inflation worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 55.85 points last
week, fell 34.01 to 2,661.94 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 221 up,
1,171 down and 451 unchanged.
   Analysts said fears of rising interest rates kept a dominant
hold on the mood among investors.
   A sharp rise in rates last week raised yields on long-term
government bonds close to 9 percent, their highest levels since
last May.
   As a new week began, predictions abounded of further increases
in rates, partly on the basis of signs that business activity had
picked up recently.
   Higher interest rates are seen as an increasingly significant
obstacle to hopes that corporate earnings might improve as the year
progresses.
   Among actively traded blue chips, DuPont dropped 1&lsqb; to 35{;
McDonald's { to 31; American Express 1 to 27&lsqb;, and General Electric
~ to 64|.
   Digital Microwave tumbled 13\ to 14} in the over-the-counter
market. At the weekend the company said its earnings for the
quarter ended March 31 would be significantly lower than expected.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
2.27 to 181.79. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.25 at 345.71.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 66.10 million shares at
noontime, against 64.76 million at the same point Friday.

<TEXT>
   Sir James Goldsmith's Hoylake Investments Ltd.
said today it would not renew its $22 billion bid for the British
conglomerate BAT Industries PLC.
   ``The directors of Hoylake wish BAT and its unbundled offspring
great success within their new structures,'' Hoylake said in a
statement.
   The hostile bid would have been the world's second-largest
takeover, after the $25 billion purchase of RJR Nabisco Inc.
   Hoylake launched the offer last July, but suspended the bid
while it sought clearance from U.S. state insurance commissioners.
   Hoylake's withdrawal comes after California's state insurance
regulators decided April 9 to bar a change of control of BAT's
Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles.
   It represented a major defeat for Goldsmith, an Anglo-French
financier who has built a worldwide reputation by taking over and
breaking up companies.
   BAT has been restructuring itself to fend off the bid from
Goldsmith. It is selling and spinning off its retailing and paper
businesses to concentrate on tobacco and financial services.
   Last week, it announced the sale of its U.S. retailer Marshall
Field's to Dayton Hudson Corp. Its Saks Fifth Avenue unit also is
on the auction block.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose against most major foreign
currencies Monday in European trading. Gold prices were mixed.
   Dealers said the dollar's advance was largely a reflection of
the selling of European currencies amid renewed jitters over German
unification.
   Market activity was modest and it appeared participants were
waiting for U.S. durable goods data on Tuesday and Friday's U.S.
gross national product figures before becoming convinced of the
dollar's strength, traders said.
   The dollar, which is considered a safe refuge in times of
upheaval, also benefited from news of growing oil shortages in
Lithuania caused by the Soviet economic embargo on the separatist
republic, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 157.55 Japanese yen from
157.60 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it was unchanged.
   The British pound rose to $1.6365 in London from $1.6357 late
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
levels were: 1.6960 West German marks, up from 1.6895; 1.4925 Swiss
francs, up up 1.4910; 5.6930 French francs, up from 5.6695; 1.9090
Dutch guilders, up from 1.8910; 1,244.00 Italian lire, up from
1,240.00; and 1.1610 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1619.
   Selected midday dollar rates in New York included: 1.6965 West
German marks; 157.65 Japanese yen; 1.49325 Swiss francs; and
1.16075 Canadian dollars.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $376.25 a troy ounce
from $374.50 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $375.85 from
$376.50 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 38 cents to close at a bid of
$376.98.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid of $5.09 a troy
ounce from $5.08 bid late Friday.

according to a Roche statement.
   The two companies also will work together on the development of

   Officials at both companies said the cooperation agreement

Western Europe for anti-cancer drugs is estimated at $700 million
annually, the Swiss company said.

<HEAD>Cyprus Becoming Business Center of War-Scarred Middle East</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is on vacation.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   History is repeating itself in Cyprus.
The east Mediterranean island, which grew fabulously rich in the
Middle Ages as the main link between Europe and the Orient, is
becoming an international offshore banking and business center.
   The merchants of Cyprus in the 15th century grew so wealthy that
they used to produce fruit bowls laden with diamonds and other gems
for important visitors, who could choose one as a gift.
   Cypriot hospitality is not so lavish now. But official
statistics list more than 6,000 offshore companies _ including 19
foreign banks, and numerous financial services _ based on the
island, which has emerged as the principal transit point to what
used to be the thriving city of Beirut, Lebanon.
   Many companies are there in name only, as Cyrprus provides a
convenient mailing address and a way to keep a presence in a part
of the world continuallly racked by war and terrorism.
   But nearly 700 maintain offices employing more than 3,000
people. The Central Bank said they pumped $95 million into the
economy of the Greek sector of the war-divided island last year.
   Cyprus was divided in 1974, when the Turkish Army invaded and
seized the northern one-third of the island. It is now a breakway
Turkish Cypriot republic.
   The island has become the regional center for major news
organizations, including the West's three major wire services. It
also has the world's fastest growing shipping registry.
   Nearly 2,000 ships call Cyprus home, making it numerically the
third largest fleet in the world. In terms of tonnage, it ranks
seventh with a gross total of nearly 19 million tons.
   The island has a long way to go to catch up with Bahrain,
financial center of the oil-rich Persian Gulf with 60 offshore
banks.
   But recently banks from the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Jordan
have set up in Cyprus and a group of 30 Japanese bankers visited
the island.
   Cyprus got its start as a regional business hub when the civil
war in Lebanon, 100 miles to the southeast, broke out in April 1975.
   Many Beirut-based companies relocated to Cyprus, a bonanza for
the island that the year before had been ravaged by the Turkish
invasion.
   The majority Greek Cypriots, who lost rich farmlands, tourist
facilities and a major port in the invasion, had little choice but
to rebuild their economy with new tourist facilities and offshore
business.
   Tourism, lifeblood of the economy, has now reached 1.3 million
visitors a year, bringing in an estimated $900 million annually for
the 550,000 Greek Cypriots.
   It still is expanding. Hani Yamani, son of the former Saudi oil
minister, Ahmet Zaki Yamani, recently announced a $300 million
project for ``the most luxurious hotel in the world,'' a Greek
history theme park and other facilities on 2,500 acres on Cyprus'
west coast.
   But the focus is to build Cyprus up as a business center. It got
a major boost when George Vassiliou, a self-made millionaire
business consultant, was elected president in February 1988.
   Addressing a business seminar last month, Vassiliou said that in
a small country with scant natural resources, ``the provision of
services is probably the only sector of activity that we can
develop steadily to provide employment and a steady increase in the
standard of living of our people.''
   Late last year, the Central Bank launched a campaign to attract
more investment and offshore business.
   Central Bank Gov. Afxentis Afxentiou stressed the island's
geographical position at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa
and its satellite communications network as advantages for
businessmen.
   He also cited air and sea transport, banking and legal services,
a skilled labor force, a low cost of living with minimal inflation
and generous financial incentives _ half the normal income tax rate
and one-tenth of the normal corporation tax.
   Other advantages are a high living standard in a society with
such a low crime rate that automobiles can be left unlocked in the
street. Also, most people speak English, a legacy of British
colonial rule that ended with independence in 1960.

   Soaring costs are forcing Eurotunnel to seek an
extra $4.1 billion from banks and investors to finish the 31-mile
rail tunnel under the English Channel, the Anglo-French consortium
said Monday.
   But Eurotunnel said it has dug half the tunnel and maintained
that the historic link between England and France would open as
scheduled in June 1993.
   When operating, Eurotunnel trains will travel from London to
Paris in three hours.
   The consortium said higher construction and borrowing costs had
pushed the project's total price tag to as high as $12.4 billion,
up from $11.4 billion in October and $7.9 billion three years ago
when the project was launched.
   The company said it would sell up to $815 million worth of new
shares to existing stockholders after it completed its talks with
its bankers about expanding credit facilities.
   Shareholders already have put up $1.63 billion and Eurotunnel's
208 banks have provided $8.2 billion in credit. The consortium said
it expected to increase its total available funds to as much as
$13.9 billion.
   ``We don't intend to go through this process again,'' Eurotunnel
Deputy Chairman Alastair Morton told a news conference.
   The deputy chairman expressed confidence in Eurotunnel's ability
to raise the extra money.
   Eurotunnel's shares were up the equivalent of 20 cents at $9.54
late Monday on London's Stock Exchange.
   The expanded credit should be in place by the end of the summer,
and the share sale should take place by the end of the year, said
Graham Corbett, managing director of finance.
   The digging has improved recently because of increased
reliability of boring machines and better ground conditions, said
Alistair Fleming, managing director of construction.
   English and French workers, digging toward each other, have
bored a total of 50 miles of tunnel, he said.
   Eurotunnel comprises three tubes, one train tunnel for each
direction, and a service tunnel which is expected to be completed
this autumn.
   ``We will break through at the end of November,'' Fleming said.
   The consortium blamed the increased costs primarily on added
expenses forecast by its main contractor Trans-Manche Link, which
cited inflation and the need to add workers to assure that the
project is completed as scheduled.
   Eurotunnel also cited rising interest costs as it increased
borrowing. British interest rates are around 15 percent.
   Some of the additional costs might be slightly offset by savings
from a cost-control agreement reached in January between Eurotunnel
and Trans-Manche Link, Eurotunnel said.
   Relations between the two have been strained over cost
differences. Eurotunnel said it still was in dispute with
Trans-Manche over $1.1 billion in costs.

   Hundreds of Post-Earth Day demonstrators blocked
traffic and overturned trash bins along Wall Street this morning,
but trading started up normally, authorities said.
   More than 170 protesters were arrested and six people including
five police officers were slightly injured, said police Sgt. Peter
Berry.
   At the Pacific Stock Exchange in San Francisco, 49 people were
arrested during a simultaneous demonstration of 300 to 500
protesters that turned violent when some broke windows at Bank of
America, threw golf balls, rocks and eggs at police and overturned
newsstands.
   Employees at some of the large corporations around the Pacific
Stock Exchange were delayed getting to work as the demonstrators
moved from one company headquarters to another. But as in New York,
stock trading got under way normally, authorities said.
   Earth Day Wall Street Action, the group sponsoring the New York
protest, said it was intended to spotlight ``institutions
responsible for much of the ecological devastation which is
destroying the planet.''
   ``The corporate people are responsible for lending the money for
much of the destruction,'' said demonstrator Ron DeChristoforo,
citing disappearing forests as an example. ``All these projects
have to come to a halt.''
   A spokesman for the San Francisco demonstrators, Daniel
Finkenthal, said their purpose was to give the public an
alternative to the corporate-sponsored views of environmental
action that surrounded Earth Day. Finkenthal, 23, predicted there
would be an increase in environmental demonstrations and more
violence in coming months and years.
   In New York, as many as 700 demonstrators blocked traffic and
overturned trash bins before police arrived in numbers to contain
the demonstration, said police spokesman Ralph St. Just.
   Officers closed one section of Wall Street to everyone but
people showing work identification, and trading began on schedule
at 9:30 a.m.
   ``Except for getting up a little early, it's a pretty normal
day,'' said Richard Torrenzano, the exchange's senior vice
president.
   As for the purpose of the protest, he said: ``We're all
concerned about these issues in our society. But we want to make
sure the exchange is open for investors throughout the world.''
   A brokerage employee, Tony Concepcion, called the demonstration
``stupid. We have nothing to do with what corporations do. I agree
with what they want, but this is just securities trading.''
   Kathy Hinds of the National Toxics Campaign said the protest was
intended to ``get a message to the folks who invest in companies
who don't respect their workers or the planet and get them to
divest.''
   Hinds, 38, of Litchfield, Maine, said she believes the death of
one of her children and illness of another was caused by her living
near a superfund dump site.
   In New York, one of the arrested demonstrators was accused of
assaulting a police officer and 172 others were charged with
disorderly conduct, Berry said. In California, charges against the
49 included unlawful assembly, vandalism and battery on a police
officer.

<HEAD>Agrees to Review Ruling on Bank Holding Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to review a
ruling that, if upheld, could cost a bank holding company over $13
million in damages.
   The court said it will decide whether First American Bankshares
Inc. (FABI) violated federal securities law prior to a 1987 merger
of its subsidiary Virginia Bankshares Inc. and the First American
Bank of Virginia.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last Dec. 15 that
FABI violated securities law by sending First American Bank of
Virginia minority shareholders misleading proxy statements.
   Before the merger, Virginia Bankshares owned 85 percent of the
stock in the First American Bank of Virginia. A merger was proposed
so FABI, through its subsidiary, would buy up the remaining 15
percent and own all the bank's stock.
   FABI paid $42 per share for the minority shareholders' stock.
   But the merger was challenged in federal court by Doris I.
Sandberg, who owned 2,242 shares of First American Bank of Virginia.
   A federal jury ruled for her, and awarded her $43,956 _ or $18
per share _ in damages.
   The presiding judge had refused to certify the suit as a ``class
action'' filed in behalf of all the bank's minority shareholders.
   The 4th Circuit court upheld the jury's verdict, but ruled that
the trial judge should have certified the lawsuit as a class action.
   ``The result of this ruling is that the $43,956 judgment that
the jury awarded to Sandberg might now be transformed on remand
into a judgment in excess of $13 million,'' lawyers for FABI told
the justices.
   In the appeal acted on Monday, the FABI lawyers argued, among
other things, that the proxy statements found to have been
misleading ``could not possibly have affected the outcome of the
proxy vote.'' The appeal said that FABI had far more than the
two-thirds of the share votes needed to bring about the merger
without the consent of any minority shareholders.
   The appeal also contended that no minority shareholder proved to
have actually relied on the statements.
   The appeals court ruled that reliance does not have to be proved
in lawsuits invoking the securities law banning false or misleading
proxy statements.
   The case is Virginia Bankshares Inc. vs. Sandberg, 89-1448.

   Bank of New England Corp. announced Monday that
former deputy treasurer secretary R.T. McNamar will join the bank
as vice chairman.
   McNamar, 51, fills the post vacated by Richard Driscoll, who
resigned several weeks ago as a part of restructuring efforts by
the bank.
   Officials hope McNamar's experience as an alternate governor of
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund will help the bank
regain its soundness, the bank said in a statement.
   BNEC announced earlier this year that it suffered heavy losses
when a large number of loans went bad from a decline in the real
estate market. The bank reported losses of more than $1 billion for
1989.
   McNamar served as deputy treasury secretary from 1981-85.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade after a rally in the soybean
complex faded late in the session.
   Wheat futures closed moderately lower while corn and oats were
narrowly mixed.
   Soybean futures rallied strongly at midday as talk of continued
slow Brazilian soybean exports prompted speculators to attempt a
push above recent highs.
   The contracts for 1991 soybean deliveries established new
lifetime highs but the rally faded after buying faltered in the
soybean meal market, said John Frazier, director of agricultural
commodity trading for Gerald Inc.
   ``Once the meal broke, the beans broke,'' he said.
   At the close, wheat futures were } cent to 3{ cents lower with

   The right to strike, a

municipal hospitals, phones and other public services.
   ``If we obtain consensus for it, that's great. If we don't, we
will push it through anyway,'' a determined Menem said last week.
   The measure would require unions that provide ``essential
services'' to give at least 10 days notice of a strike, and submit
to mediation by the Labor Ministry that could last 15 more days.
   Management would be authorized to hire enough workers for a
``minimum'' level of service. If strikers did not comply with the
notice, or tried to block all service, they could be fired and
unions could lose their legal status.
   The legislation cites public health, transport, energy, schools
and telecommunications as ``essential'' services, and leaves open
the possibility that strikes by private unions also might be
regulated.
   Victor de Gennaro, director of the 145,000-member Association of
State Employees, said the bill ``has as its objective the
intimidation of workers.''
   Juan Manuel Casella, the Civic Radical Union's candidate for
vice president in the May 1989 national elections, said the
legislation is aimed more to ``punish'' workers than to regulate
strikes.
   The measure, which Menem at first said he would impose by
decree, upset even Peronist legislators reluctant to alienate a
group whose support has been steadfast during three decades of
repression.
   Peronist Sen. Orando Britos said flatly he would vote against
it. A bloc of eight dissident Peronist deputies in the lower house
indicated they would, too.
   Technically, the ruling party has an absolute majority in the
Senate and a working majority in the Chamber of Deputies.
   Menem, 59, is a lifelong member of the party and a three-time
provincial governor. He was arrested and held in detention with
many Peronist politicians and labor leaders following the March
1976 military coup that toppled President Isabel Peron.
   The measure is not his first that unions say is anti-labor.
   Since Menem took office last July amid hyperinflation and
recession, public service rates have risen faster than salaries,
contributing to the contraction of real wages.
   Despite campaign promises of massive wage hikes and a
``productive revolution,'' Menem has imposed an austerity budget
that has exacerbated unemployment.
   As many as 4.8 million Argentines, of a workforce of 12.5
million, are unemployed or under-employed, according to the Labor
Ministry.
   Menem appointed executives from Argentina's largest
multinational company as his first two economy ministers. He
ignored union pleas by lifting controls on wages, prices and
foreign exchange and by committing the government to sell
money-losing public companies.
   Anticipating conflict, Menem tried to unseat Saul Ubaldini as
leader of the 3-million-member General Labor Confederation. That
failed, but the confederation split into rival camps.
   In recent weeks, public school teachers from grade school
through university have boycotted classes. Employees of the
state-owned airline and telephone company have staged wildcat
strikes. Doctors at municipal hospitals and court clerks have
walked off the job.
   Unions are demanding pay increases which the government says it
cannot afford. Also, they are seeking a greater voice in the sale
of state companies, two of which _ the airline and telephone
company _ are to be sold this year.
   After months of currency devaluation and inflation that soared
by 95 percent last month, there are signs the government is
bringing the economy under control.
   Inflation in April is projected at 12 percent to 15 percent. The
austral has held steady at 5,000 for every U.S. dollar, or less,
since early March. Prices in supermarkets and department stores
have begun to come down.
   After an estimated 60,000 union members staged an
anti-government demonstration on the steps of Congress, that many
and more rallied at Government House to shout their support for
Menem.

   Sir James Goldsmith's Hoylake Investments Ltd.
said today it would not renew its $22 billion bid for the British
conglomerate BAT Industries PLC.
   The hostile bid of 878 pence, or $14.31, a share would have been
the world's second-largest takeover, after Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
&amp; Co.'s $25 billion purchase of RJR Nabisco Inc. completed early
last year.
   The Hoylake investors group dropped the bid because it ``simply
felt that the combination of the time the bid would take to get
through U.S. regulatory hurdles and the costs thereof tipped the
risk-reward ratio the wrong way,'' said a spokesman for one of
Hoylake's merchant banks, who spoke anonymously.
   Hoylake said in a statement: ``The directors of Hoylake wish BAT
and its unbundled offspring great success within their new
structures.''
   Hoylake's withdrawal comes after California's state insurance
regulators decided April 9 to bar a change of control of BAT's
Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles. The offer needed
approval from the commissioners of the nine states where Farmers
operates.
   The withdrawal is a major defeat for Goldsmith, an Anglo-French
financier who has built a worldwide reputation by taking over and
breaking up companies.
   The news of the withdrawal came after London's Stock Exchange
closed. BAT shares ended at 724 pence, or $11.80, a share, down 4
pence.
   Hoylake launched the offer last July, but suspended it in
September while it sought the clearance from the U.S. state
insurance commissioners.
   BAT has been restructuring itself to fend off the bid. The
Hoylake withdrawal probably will not affect the restructuring,
which is designed to boost BAT's share price.
   ``I am pleased that Hoylke and Axa-Midi have finally abandoned
their bid,'' BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy said in a statement issued
in the United States. ``We can now devote our full attention to
running the continuing Group based on our financial services and
tobacco businesses.
   The Hoylake investors group also included British merchant
banker Jacob Rothschild and Australian businessman Kerry Packer.
   Goldsmith, and other shareholders, have complained that BAT's
stock price does not reflect the stock's real value because it is
dragged down by the slower growth of its tobacco businesses.
   BAT is selling and spinning off its retailing and paper
businesses to concentrate on tobacco and financial services.
   Last week, BAT announced the sale of its U.S. retailer Marshall
Field's to Dayton Hudson Corp. Its Saks Fifth Avenue unit also is
on the auction block.
   BAT also is in the process of buying back up to 10 percent of
its own stock.

<HEAD>Japanese Company Makes Friendly Offer for Aquascutum</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Japanese company has made a friendly offer of
73.8 million pounds, or $120 million, for Aquascutum Group PLC, the
classic British clothing retailer, the companies said Monday.
   Renown Inc., a Japanese clothing manufacturer that specializes
in middle-range ladies' wear, offered 200 pence, or $3.26, for each
of Aquascutum's 27.3 million special A shares, the companies said.
   In addition, Renown offered 550 pence, or $8.97, for each of the
company's 3.5 million ordinary shares, they said.
   Aquascutum's board of directors approved of the deal, and Renown
already has acquired enough of Aquascutum's shares to control the
company, said Gerald Abrahams, Aquascutum's chairman and chief
executive.
   The companies said Renown already has bought 9.35 percent of the
A shares and 65.6 percent of the ordinary shares from the Abrahams
family and other shareholders.
   The deal appears to block attempts by dissident holders of
ordinary shares who have been seeking to end the special voting
rights of Aquascutum's A shares. Those efforts had raised the
prospect of a hostile offer for the company.
   Founded in 1851, Aquascutum operates a dozen of its own stores,
with flagships in London and New York, and wholesale outlets in 45
countries. It has 1,600 employees.
   Abrahams said the offer was ``an exciting opportunity to
expand'' and that it would allow Aquascutum to ``get on with our
business.''
   The Japanese firm is seeking to upgrade its clothing line,
Abrahams said.
   ``We are a growing business in the Far East, a prestigious brand
of very high quality goods,'' Abrahams said.
   Aquascutum will remain based in London, he said.
   The company also announced that its net profit for the year
ended Jan. 31 fell 3 percent to 1.93 million pounds, or $3.1
million, from 1.99 million pounds a year earlier. Earnings per
share declined to 6.26 pence, or 10.2 cents, from 6.53 pence.
   Sales rose 5.6 percent to 52.6 million pounds, or $85.7 million,
from 49.8 million pounds in the previous year.

   CalFed Inc., parent of California Federal
Bank, reported first-quarter earnings of $18.9 million, partly
attributing the 8 percent increase to a $1.3 million gain from the
sale of its London-based insurance subsidiary.
   The earnings of 74 cents per share compared with earnings of
$17.5 million, or 67 cents per share, for the first quarter of 1989.
   CalFed, which is shedding assets as part of a plan to
concentrate on the core savings and loan operations, also said it
expects layoffs and other belt-tightening at banking operations
save about $24 million in 1990. Those savings were not expected to
show up until the second quarter, CalFed said.
   The Feb. 6 sale of the Anglo American Insurance Co. Ltd. was
part of CalFed's strategy of concentrating on banking.
   The company also said it had agreed during the first quarter to
sell its term life and accident and health insurance businesses to
Montgomery Ward Life Insurance Co. CalFed said it expects to break
even on the sale, scheduled to be completed during the second
quarter.
   CalFed listed assets of $25.3 billion as of March 31, compared
with $28.3 billion a year earlier.

   Stock prices fell for the fourth straight
session today, still in the grip of interest-rate and inflation
worries.
   Analysts said fears of rising interest rates kept a dominant
hold on the mood among investors.
   A sharp rise in rates last week raised yields on long-term
government bonds close to 9 percent, their highest levels since
last May.
   As a new week began, predictions abounded of further increases
in rates, partly on the basis of signs that business activity had
picked up recently.
   Higher interest rates are seen as an increasingly significant
obstacle to hopes that corporate earnings might improve as the year
progresses.

<HEAD>Frustrated By U.S. Regulators, Goldsmith Ends Nine-month Takeover
Battle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frustrated by U.S. regulatory delays, Sir James
Goldsmith's Hoylake Investments Ltd. on Monday ended its
acrimonious, nine-month takeover battle for the British
conglomerate BAT Industries PLC.
   The decision marks a major defeat for Goldsmith, the noted
raider whose group's $22 billion all-securities offer for BAT would
have been the world's second-largest takeover after the $25 billion
buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. last year.
   BAT, whose U.S. companies include Brown &amp; Williamson tobacco and
the Saks Fifth Avenue department stores, has been restructuring by
selling its retailing and paper businesses to concentrate on
tobacco and financial services.
   Goldsmith and other shareholders have complained that the slower
growth of the tobacco businesses has dragged down BAT's stock
price, and that several of its business lines needed to be
jettisoned.
   But two weeks ago, California insurance regulators decided to
block the proposed sale of BAT's Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of
Los Angeles, a key element of the planned takeover.
   Hoylake had planned to sell Farmers for $4.5 billion to the
French insurance group Axa-Midi Assurances. The offer needed
approval from the commissioners of a total of nine states where
Farmers operates.
   A London source close to Hoylake said the group, which also
includes British merchant banker Jacob Rothschild and Australian
businessman Kerry Packer, dropped its offer because of U.S.
regulatory delays.
   ``We have always felt we could achieve a favorable position but
it could take quite a while,'' said the source, who didn't want to
be identified. ``We didn't feel it was in the best interests of the
shareholders given the uncertainties.''
   After Hoylake announced Monday that it was withdrawing, Axa-Midi
announced in Paris that it had dropped its bid.
   Axa's statement said that ``we understand Hoylake's decision,
but we are sorry that it obliges us to give up the acquisition of
Farmers.''
   Jeffrey Beyer, a Farmers Group spokesman in Los Angeles, said
state regulators' objections to Axa-Midi's debt-financed offer for
Farmers and the way Hoylake proposed to transfer ownership had been
wide-ranging and nearly impossible to remedy.
   ``Certainly Axa was facing what we thought were insurmountable
difficulties,'' Beyer said.
   Hoylake's offer of 878 pence _ the equivalent of $14.31 _ worth
of securities for each BAT share had been suspended since last
September while it sought regulatory approval.
   BAT's shares finished down 4 pence at 724 pence, or about
$11.80, on London's Stock Exchange. The statements came after the
exchange close, and BAT declined about 40 pence in after hours
trading.
   BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy issued a statement that he was
pleased about Hoylake's decision, which he called overdue. He said
the company would press ahead with its massive defensive
restructuring.
   Last week, BAT announced the sale of its U.S. retailer Marshall
Field's to Dayton Hudson Corp. for $1.04 billion. Saks Fifth Avenue
also is on the auction block.
   ``Shareholders gave overwhelming support to our reshaping
proposals (in a vote) last October,'' Sheehy stated. ``Today's
overdue decision by Hoylake does not alter our resolve to see that
program through to its completion and to continue to maximize value
for our shareholders.''
   For Goldsmith, who built a worldwide reputation for taking over
and breaking up companies, the withdrawal represents a major defeat.
   ``I think he's gone (from BAT) for good,'' said Jack Jones, an
analyst with the London investment firm UBS Philips and Drew.
   Jones said he was somewhat surprised by the decision, given
recent positive comments by Hoylake and Axa-Midi.
   But William de Winton, of Nomura Research Institute in London,
said he was surprised how long the expensive bid dragged on.
   ``From the start everyone knew the regulatory hurdle would be
the problem,'' de Winton said. ``They took it further than some
people expected them to.
   ``Anyone going for BAT will face what in effect seems to amount
to a poison pill in the form of the U.S. state regulatory system,''
he said.
   Hoylake controls about 19 million BAT shares, or about 2 percent
of the company, said a Hoylake spokesman. No decision had been made
on what to do with the stake, said the spokesman, who was not
identified, in accordance with British practice.

   Oil giant Exxon Corp. reported Monday that its net income
declined 29.3 percent in the first quarter due to an accounting
change, while fifth-ranked Amoco Corp. said its profit edged up 1.7
percent.
   Ashland Oil Inc., meanwhile, posted net income of $1 million for
the second quarter of its fiscal year, compared with a $14 million
loss a year earlier. Amerada Hess Corp. said its first-quarter
profit plummeted 82 percent.
   For the three months ended March 31, Exxon's profit fell to
$1.28 billion, or $1.01 a share, from $1.81 billion, or $1.41 a
share, in the first quarter of 1989.
   Net income in the year-earlier quarter included a $535 million
accounting gain resulting from Exxon's adoption of a new accounting
standard for income taxes. Excluding the one-time gain, New
York-based Exxon earned $1.275 billion, or 99 cents a share, in the
first quarter of 1989.
   First-quarter revenue for Exxon, the nation's largest oil
company, jumped 20.3 percent to $26.7 billion from $22.2 billion.
   ``Crude (oil) production, natural gas sales, petroleum product
sales and chemical sales all increased over last year's quarter,''
Exxon Chairman L.G. Rawl said in a press statement. ``Higher crude
prices and increased operating volumes helped boost earnings from
exploration and production operations to their highest quarterly
level in four years.''
   The company plans nearly $8 billion in capital spending this
year, Rawl noted, up from $7.2 billion in 1989.
   On Wednesday, Exxon shareholders gathering at the annual meeting
in Houston are expected to consider six environmental proposals
seeking to make the company more ecologically responsive, in the
wake of the Valdez oil spill last year.
   Amoco said its first-quarter net income edged up to $466
million, or 91 cents a share, from $458 million, or 89 cents a
share, a year earlier, mainly reflecting higher crude prices.
   Revenue of Chicago-based Amoco rose 9.2 percent to $7.1 billion
from $6.5 billion.
   Ashland, the fourteenth-largest U.S. oil company, saids its
earnings per share amountred to 2 cents in the quarter ended March
31 in contrast to a loss of 25 cents a share a year earlier.
   The $14 million loss a year earlier included a $9 million
after-tax charge stemming from an arbitration award in a commercial
dispute.
   Second-quarter revenue increased 10.5 percent to $2.1 billion
from $1.9 billion a year earlier.
   ``Although Ashland improved its results from a year ago, the
second quarter again proved to be a difficult earnings period,''
said John R. Hall, Ashland's chairman. ``Refinery margins were
strong in early January but deteriorated rapidly before improving
in late March.''
   For the six months ending March 31, Ashland had net income of
$23 million, or 41 cents a share, down from earnings of $82
million, or $1.48 a share, in the same period a year earlier.
Six-month revenue rose to $4.3 billion from $4 billion.
   Amerada Hess, based in New York, said it earned $39.7 million,
or 49 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31, down
from $220.2 million, or $2.70 per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 12.2 percent to $1.66 billion from $1.48 billion a
year earlier.
   The decline in net income was due to sharply lower earnings from
refining and marketing operations and higher corporate charges.
   Refining and marketing operations had earnings of $24.5 million
in the latest quarter, down from $208.4 million a year earlier,
while corporate charges including interest expense rose to $42.5
million, up from $17 million.

<DATELINE>SPRINGDALE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tyson Foods Inc. on Monday reported a
21.2 percent jump in its second-quarter earnings as sales almost
doubled due to the takeover of poultry rival Holly Farms.
   Tyson earned a record $26.3 million, or 40 cents a share, in the
three months ended March 31, up from $21.7 million, or 34 cents a
share, a year earlier, the company said in a news release.
   The higher earnings came on sales of $931.9 million for the
quarter, compared with $534.9 million for the corresponding 1989
quarter.
   Gerald Johnston, Tyson's executive vice president of finance,
attributed the large growth in sales and earnings to the merger
with Holly Farms, which was completed on Aug. 19. Tyson would have
expected a 10 percent increase in sales had the merger not taken
place, Johnston said.
   For the six months ended March 31, Tyson reported a profit of
$49.4 million. That was 19 percent higher than $41.5 million in
1989's first half. Earnings per share were 75 cents during this
year's first half, compared with 65 cents a year earlier. Sales
grew to $1.83 billion from $1.04 billion.
   Tyson produces and markets prepackaged, precooked and
convenience poultry and other foods.

<HEAD>Dollar Gains; Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar strengthened against most major
currencies Monday, benefiting from the West German mark's weakness.
   Speculation that U.S. interest rates will move higher as the
economy continues to expand also encouraged dollar buying, dealers
said.
   Gold prices were mixed, rising in New York after falling in some
overseas markets. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion
for April delivery settled at $378.90 a troy ounce, $2.30 higher
than Friday's close. Later, Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a troy ounce of gold bullion at $378.65 as of 4 p.m. EDT, up
$2.40 from Friday's late bid.
   Ronald Holzer, chief currency dealer at Harris Trust in Chicago,
said the mark was sold heavily amid worries about the consequences
of planned German unification.
   The governments of East and West Germany have said they will
merge their economies completely on July 1 as a prelude to full
unification, expected next year. But the governments have not
reached a final agreement on linking their currencies.
   The dollar, which is considered a safe investment refuge in
times of economic or political uncertainty, also benefited from
news of growing oil shortages in Lithuania caused by the Soviet
economic embargo on the republic.
   Also contributing to the dollar's strength were expectations of
domestic economic growth accompanied by rising credit costs. Higher
U.S. interest rates would enhance returns on dollar-denominated
investments and tend to boost demand for dollars.
   ``I would say the dollar is benefiting in general from higher
U.S. rates and the perception that the U.S. economy is still moving
along at a moderate to good pace,'' Holzer said.
   It was anticipated that a report due Tuesday on orders for
durable goods and a report Friday on the gross national product
would confirm that the economic expansion has staged a modest
revival.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 157.55 Japanese yen from
157.60 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it was unchanged.
In New York, the dollar settled at 157.55 yen, up from 157.50 yen
on Friday.
   The British pound rose to $1.6365 in London from $1.6357 late
Friday. Later in New York, sterling dipped to $1.63565 from
Friday's $1.6388.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's late
quotes, included: 1.6995 West German marks, up from 1.6872; 1.4935

bullion for current delivery fell to $5.093 a troy ounce from
Friday's settlement of $5.099. Silver bullion rose in London to a
late bid of $5.09 a troy ounce from $5.08 bid late Friday.

   Oil futures prices closed higher Monday in
anticipation of OPEC's meeting next month about its soaring
production levels.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, rose 25 cents to close at $19.07 a 42-gallon
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The May contract for delivery of home heating oil advanced 0.18
cent to close at 53.12 cents a gallon, while the May contract for
unleaded regular gasoline picked up 1.61 cents and settled at 63.54
cents a gallon.
   Analysts said the market moved higher on momentum that began
Thursday, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
announced that its price monitoring committee would meet May 2 to
discuss the cartel's soaring production.
   Oil analysts have estimated the 13-nation cartel is pumping more
than 24 million barrels of crude a day, well over its ceiling of
22.1 million barrels a day.
   The increased output had depressed oil prices in recent weeks.
The possibility that the organization might put a cap on its
production raised traders' hopes that prices might return to their
higher levels, and energy futures rallied on Thursday.
   Prices were mostly lower on Friday, but traders were again
optimistic Monday, according to Andrew Lebow, an analyst with
E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   Meanwhile, natural gas for June delivery closed at $1.555 per
million British thermal units Monday, up from $1.543 on Friday.

<HEAD>Debt-Burdened Hospital Chain Sells Four Swiss Hospitals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Medical International
Inc., working to reduce debt from its buyout by an investor group,
agreed Monday to sell its Swiss hospitals for about $167 million to
Klinik Hirslanden AG, a Swiss health-care provider.
   IMA Acquisition Corp. borrowed heavily to finance the $1.7
billion takeover completed in October. It also took over payments
on about $1.4 billion in existing loans to AMI, bringing its debt
to about $3 billion.
   Monday's agreement involves four acute care hospitals in Zurich,
Aarau, Bern and Lausanne, the largest privately owned hospital
group in Switzerland.
   AMI operates 61 hospitals, mostly acute care facilities in
California, Florida and Texas, and is the country's fourth-largest
hospital chain in terms of beds.
   AMI's chairman and chief executive, Harry J. Gray, described the
sale of the Swiss hospitals as a significant part of the company's
18-month plan to sell off about $1 billion in assets.
   ``AMI's divestiture program continues to progress on schedule at
our pricing expectations,'' he said.
   AMI also hopes to halve its annual administrative costs, which
topped $93 million in fiscal 1989, as corporate offices are moved
from Beverly Hills to Dallas.

   The stock market declined broadly for the fourth
straight session Monday, extending a losing streak blamed largely
on interest-rate worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 29.28 to
2,666.67, extending its loss since last Tuesday to 99.10 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 4 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
328 up, 1,229 down and 425 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 136.15 million
shares, down from 174.26 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 164.62 million shares.
   Analysts said fears of rising interest rates kept a dominant
influence on the mood of investors.
   A sharp rise in rates last week raised yields on long-term
government bonds close to 9 percent, their highest levels since
last May. As a new week began, predictions abounded of further
increases in rates, partly on the basis of signs that business
activity had picked up recently.
   Higher interest rates are seen as an increasingly significant
obstacle to hopes that corporate earnings might improve as the year
progresses.
   Current profit reports for the early stages of 1990, meanwhile,
continued to get a subdued to negative response from traders, even
though Wall Street had been braced for a good many unpleasant
surprises.
   Among actively traded blue chips, DuPont dropped ~ to 35};
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph { to 40&rsqb;; General Electric 1 to 64{,
and American Express ~ to 27\.
   James Robinson III, chief executive of American Express, said he
expected the company's Shearson Lehman Hutton brokerage operation
to return to profitability soon.
   Among other securities-industry stocks, Merrill Lynch fell } to
22{; Salomon Inc. { to 20|, and Charles Schwab \ to 15&lsqb;.
   Pansophic Systems tumbled 5&lsqb; to 10{. The company estimated
results at about break-even for the fiscal year that ends next week.
   Digital Microwave plunged 13~ to 14&lsqb; in the over-the-counter
market. At the weekend the company said its earnings for the
quarter ended March 31 would be significantly lower than expected.
   Storage Technology bucked the downtrend, gaining 1&rsqb; to 22~, as
the company posted an increase in first-quarter operating profits
that exceeded most analysts' estimates.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $39.35 billion, or 1.22
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 2.13 to 181.93.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 4.69 to 385.21, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 4.07 at 331.05.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 5.69 to 420.10. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 344.95, down 3.01.

<HEAD>Santa Fe Railway to Lay Off 850 Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 850 workers for the Santa Fe railroad face
layoffs because of sharp drops in shipments of automobiles and
grain, two of the railroad's most important commodities, the
company announced Monday.
   ``Some of the layoffs will start as early as a week from
today,'' Robert Gehrt, spokesman for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa
Fe Railway Co., said Monday. ``We hope to have most of them in
place by May 15.''
   The layoffs will affect about 125 workers at the locomotive shop
at San Bernardino, Calif., and an additional 100 from the railroad
car repair shops in Topeka, Kan., the company said in a statement.
   About 70 workers will be laid off from the company's centralized
work equipment plant at Albuquerque, N.M., and 15 will be laid off
at the Newton, Kan., rail plant, the statement said.
   An additional 200 section gang workers, one from each gang, and
75 specialty gang employees will be laid off.
   About 100 management employees will be laid off, but the
departments affected by those cutbacks have not been determined,
company president Michael R. Haverty said in the statement.
   Santa Fe, which employs about 18,000 people, said the remainder
of the layoffs ``are not expected to have a major impact in any one
community.''
   Automobile shipping dropped 47 percent in early April and grain
shipping declined 40 percent. The two normally account for about 22
percent of the railroad's business.
   ``When you get a big hit like this in those two areas, it's
something to be concerned about,'' Gehrt said.
   Piggybacking semi-trailers account for more than 20 percent of
the company's business, Gehrt said, while shipments of food and
farm products other than grain accounts for about 14 percent and
chemicals for about 12 percent.
   Haverty said the layoffs are similar to seasonal employment
reductions the company has undergone in the past but are more
severe.
   Santa Fe blamed a $10 million increase in fuel costs during the
first quarter and ``mediocre'' first-quarter performance for the
layoffs.
   The company reported first-quarter operating income of $66.1
million, compared with $34.2 million for the same quarter last year.
   ``But we had a big property tax refund in California of over $30
million this quarter, and without that we would have been just
about even,'' Gehrt said. ``And last year's figures included a
special charge of over $50 million. (The first quarter of 1990)
wasn't a good quarter.''

<HEAD>Bass Group Supports Vote on Avon Shareholders Rights Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment group headed by Texas financier
Robert M. Bass said Monday it planned to vote in favor of a
shareholders' rights plan at the Avon Products Inc. annual meeting
next month.
   The Robert M. Bass Group decision was disclosed in a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington.
   The Bass Group, which holds a 5.9 percent stake in the New
York-based cosmetics company, said it would vote in favor of
submitting the company's `poison pill' defense to a shareholder
vote. Bass Group said it also supported a proposal seeking
confidential voting for shareholders.
   But the Bass Group said it would vote against a proposal to set
up a Shareholders Advisory Committee at the annual meeting in New
York on May 3.
   A spokesman for Avon, John Cox, said the company _ which opposes
the poison pill and confidential voting proposals _ had no comment
on the Bass Group disclosure.
   A poison pill defense makes it prohibitively expensive to take
over a company. Keeping the identity of those voting in shareholder
elections secret from management has been a growing issue among
shareholders rights groups.
   The Bass Group announcement came three weeks after Avon's
largest shareholder, Chartwell Associates, said it had boosted its
stake to 16 percent. Chartwell had been pressuring Avon management
for representation on the board.
   Chartwell Associates is a limited partnership that includes oil
heir Gordon P. Getty's Family Trust, a subsidiary of Dallas-based
Mary Kay Corp. and the Fisher real estate family of New York.
   Avon rejected takeover proposals twice last year from Amway
Corp. and Minneapolis-based investor Irwin Jacobs.

<TEXT>
   Bond prices slipped Monday in light trading,
echoing declines overseas as the market awaited economic reports
due later this week.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 7-32 point, or about
$2.19 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices
fall, rose to 8.96 percent from 8.94 percent late Friday.
   The last time the yield on the 30-year bond was as high was last
May 11, when it stood at 9.07 percent.
   The 30-year bond has plunged more than $41 per $1,000 over the
past seven trading days in response to signs of increasing
inflation, a stronger economy and worries about upcoming bond
issues, including the Treasury's quarterly refunding auction set
for next month.
   Higher inflation and an economic upturn could prompt the Federal
Reserve to keep interest rates high. Higher rates decrease the
value of fixed-return investments such as bonds.
   An increased supply of bonds can temporarily drive down prices
until the market absorbs the new issues.
   There were few forces acting on the bond market Monday except
for a softness in prices in overseas trading before U.S. trading
began, said William V. Sullivan, director of money market research
for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``It was lethargic,'' he said. ``So the market was just really
drifting. The market's looking ahead to the upcoming data release.''
   On Tuesday, the government is scheduled to release reports on
durable goods orders for March and the employment-cost index for
the first quarter, while the first report on the gross national
product for 1990 is set to be announced Friday.
   The market had little reaction to news that West Germany agreed
to exchange a limited number of East German marks for West German
marks at a 1-1 ratio. Some economists believe such a ratio could
cause inflation in West Germany, but Sullivan said bond traders
probably viewed the proposal as preliminary.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell from 1-32 point to &lsqb; point, intermediate
maturities lost between 5-32 point and 7-32 point, and long-term
issues were off from 3-16 point to \ point, according to Telerate
Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.41 to 1,133.05.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 5-32 point to 90 15-32 point. The
average yield to maturity rose to 7.61 percent from 7.59 percent
late Thursday.
   At an auction Monday, the Treasury sold $8.2 billion in
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.78 percent, up
from 7.71 percent last week. Another $8.2 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.91 percent, up
from 7.75 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 7.80
percent April 9, and six-month bills averaged 7.92 percent March 19.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bills, yields on
three-month bills rose to 7.97 percent as the discount rose 3 basis
points to 7.72 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.28
percent as the discount gained 6 basis points to 7.86 percent.
Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.49 percent as the discount
gained 6 basis point to 7.89 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 3-16 percent, unchanged
from late Friday.

<HEAD>Farm Subsidies Still Snag in U.S.-EEC Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American and West European officials agreed on
Monday to strengthen their economic and political ties but
disagreed on how to resolve a simmering discord over farm subsidies.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who led the U.S.
delegation to the talks with the European Economic Community, said
the two sides discussed the changes in Eastern Europe and how these
would affect the EEC and the United States.
   The two teams also discussed the Soviet sanctions against
Lithuania. Baker said the EEC shared with the United States the
``growing international concerns'' about the Soviet response to the
secessionist Baltic state.
   The U.S.-EEC ministerial talks, held for the first time in the
United States since they began in 1981, also focused on the effects
of German unification on the European economy. The subject, as well
as the U.S. views, will come up Saturday at the EEC summit in
Dublin, Ireland.
   Both Baker and EEC President Jacques Delors stressed the
importance of coordinating their positions as the pace of European
unification accelerates toward the target date of 1992 and as the
EEC tries to handle the changes brought about by the collapse of
communism in Eastern Europe.
   The United States is particularly concerned that as the EEC
moves toward a monetary and trade union among its 12 member
nations, U.S. business will be shut out. The EEC is determined to
reassure the Americans that the new system will leave plenty of
room for trade with the United States.
   ``This meeting has taken place at a crossroads in Atlantic
history, at a time of new significance to the partnership between
the Community and the United States,'' Delors told reporters after
his day-long talks with Baker.
   Both sides agreed on the need to bring the Uruguay Round of
international trade talks to a successful conclusion by the end of
the year.
   But officials on both sides said they were worried that their
dispute on agriculture could endanger the trade talks among 96
nations, which began in 1986 and are intended to liberalize
commerce around the world.
   The agriculture dispute revolves around the question of farm
subsidies, with the United States demanding the 12 EEC nations do
away with support for farmers and the Europeans saying this is an
unrealistic demand.
   ``It's certain the United States wants to go down the road f
reform more than the EEC,'' said Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter. ``That doesn't mean we can't resolve our differences until
December.''
   The two delegations agreed to speed up their talks on the
subject and appointed staff members to deal with various aspects of
the dispute, including the question of market access and export
subsidies.
   But the EEC's agriculture commissioner, Raymond McSharr,
cautioned that ``there are many difficulties, and they musn't be
underestimated.''

<TEXT>
   American Express Co. Chairman James D. Robinson
III told shareholders Monday the company's troubled Wall Street
subsidiary Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. was ``well positioned'' to
return to profitability.
   Shearson reported a $915 million first-quarter loss _ the
largest in securities industry history _ in large part to pay for a
restructuring that included 2,000 layoffs and business cuts
initiated by American Express.
   American Express lost $620 million in the first three months of
1990 because of the troubles at Shearson.
   ``It's the price we paid to put Shearson's major problems behind
us,'' Robinson told about 500 shareholders attending American
Express' annual meeting in New York.
   ``Shearson needed time and capital but market conditions
demanded immediate action,'' he said.
   American Express last month announced a plan to buy all the
remaining publicly held shares of Shearson, capping several months
of turmoil at the Wall Street firm that analysts say overexpanded
in the 1980s.
   The payment card and travel services giant moved to gain
management control of Shearson by ousting Peter Cohen as chairman
and installing an American Express executive in his place, Howard
L. Clark Jr.
   Shearson then laid off 2,000 workers in March, with more
expected by the end of the year, and began plans to eliminate or
scale back several business lines.
   In addition to extending its current 61 percent stake to full
ownership, American Express has provided $1.15 billion to shore up
Shearson's capital base in recent months.
   Robinson said that six months ago Shearson ``didn't fit as a
core operating entity'' and had been reduced to a strategic
investment.
   He attributed Shearson's troubles to declining stock trading
activity since the 1987 market crash, rising worldwide interest
rates, a slumping domestic real estate market and the collapse of
the junk bond market last fall.
   ``The environment for securities companies changed rapidly and
radically,'' Robinson said. ``The result was a crisis for
Shearson.''
   But he said American Express' changes at the investment firm had
left Shearson ``well positioned'' to make money. He did not say
when he expected Shearson to become profitable.
   Robinson admitted that some of Shearson's expansion moves in the
1980s under Cohen were wrong, including the 1988 purchase of E.F.
Hutton Inc., which added an extensive retail brokerage network and
expensive overhead while causing animosity among employees.
   ``In retrospect the Hutton acquisition or at least the way it
was structured was a mistake,'' he said.
   At the annual meeting, shareholders elected three new American
Express board members: Motorola Inc. Chairman George M.C. Fisher,
New York City Opera President Beverly Sills Greenough; and Dow
Chemical Co. President Frank P. Popoff.

<HEAD>Pork Bellies Soar On Smaller-Than-Expected Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices of most pork belly futures contracts surged the permitted
daily limit of 2 cents a pound Monday on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange after an Agriculture Department report showed smaller
supplies than traders had anticipated.
   On other commodity markets, hog futures rallied while cattle
futures were mixed; orange juice futures fell sharply; oil futures
advanced; cotton was up; precious metals were mixed; and grain and
soybean futures were mixed.
   Frozen pork belly futures settled 1.1 cents to 2 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in May up 2 cents at 64.32 cents a
pound.
   Hog futures ended .20 cent to .95 cent higher with June at 62.02
cents a pound; live cattle were .27 cent lower to .20 cent higher
with June at 73.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .28 cent lower
to .25 cent higher with April at 83.90 cents a pound.
   The runup in the belly market had been expected since late
Friday afternoon, when the USDA released a monthly report showing
97.5 million pounds of the raw bacon meat in the nation's
commercial freezers at the end of March.
   The figure was nearly 3 million pounds below the average market
estimate and compared with 86 million pounds at the end of February
and a record 129 million pounds a year ago.
   The USDA also released a cattle supply report Friday _ the
quarterly estimage of cattle on feedlots in the 13 largest producer
states _ which showed a larger-than-expected number of cattle
placed on feedlots during the first quarter.
   But analysts said the futures market's deep discount to cash
prices last week had already reflected expectations for larger
supplies by June, so the futures market had little reaction Monday
to the report.
   Orange juice futures plunged on the New York Cotton Exchange,
largely reflecting speculative selling ahead of May 1, the first
day for traders to declare intentions to deliver orange juice
against the May contract.
   Speculators holding obligations to take delivery of a commodity
typically liquidate those positions as first notice day approaches
so as to avoid taking physical delivery.
   Celeste Georkakis, an analyst with Cargill Investor Servicers
Inc., said further selling was prompted by a Florida Department of
Citrus report estimating a 10 percent decline in U.S. demand for
orange juice, mainly reflecting a drop in consumption of frozen
concentrate.
   Orange juice futures settled 3.35 cents to 5.85 cents lower with
May at $1.8965 a pound.
   Cotton futures advanced strongly on the Cotton Exchange,
reflecting position-evening ahead of Tuesday, first notice day for
the May contract.
   Cotton specialist Ernest Simon of Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. said world demand for high-quality U.S. cotton has
strengthened due to a poor Australian crop.
   Cotton settled .20 cent to 1.30 cents higher with May at 75.31
cents a pound.
   Oil futures rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid
jitters about the May 2 OPEC meeting and what measures the oil
cartel may take to support oil prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 25 cents
higher with June at $19.07 a barrel; heating oil was .15 cent to
.67 cent higher with May at 53.12 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .35 cent to 1.61 cents higher with May at 63.54 cents a gallon.
   Gold futures benefitted from weakness in the stock and bond
markets, as investors shifted assets to the perceived safety of
gold.
   Gold settled $2.30 to $2.90 higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange with April at $378.90 a troy ounce; silver was 0.4 cent to
0.8 cent lower with May at $5.10 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures prices ended mixed on the Chicago
Board of Trade after a rally in the soybean complex faded late in
the session.
   Wheat futures settled { cent to 3{ cents lower with May at
$3.70\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to } cent higher with May at
$2.78 a bushel; oats were \ cent to 2 cents higher with May at
$1.57} a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 3{ cents higher with May
at $6.05} a bushel.

<HEAD>Digital Announces Plans to Buy Up to 5 Million Shares of Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAYNARD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer giant Digital Equipment Corp. has
been authorized by its board to buy back up to 5 million shares of
its own common stock on the open market, a company spokesman said
Monday.
   The purchase would represent about 4.1 percent of the company's
outstanding common stock, which amounts to more than 122 million
shares.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, Digital
stock rose 25 cents a share to close at $83.25. At that price, a
buyback of 5 million shares would cost $416.25 million.
   ``We believe the current market value of Digital stock does not
reflect the underlying strengths of the company, its customers,
products and the markets it serves, as well as its strong financial
position,'' said James M. Osterhoff, vice president of finance.
   The shares purchased would be ``a way to return some of that
value to the stockholders,'' said Bradley Allen, spokesman for
Digital.
   ``Some of the shares will be used to supply the employee
purchase stock fund,'' Allen said.
   He said the company had previously repurchased 18 million shares
of its common stock on the open market for $2.1 billion in cash
during the last few years.

   On the eve of government hearings to choose six
more U.S.-to-Japan air routes, United Airlines is counting on its
political connections to help it beat out archrival American
Airlines for a Chicago-Tokyo link.
   United bragged Monday that it had successfully solicited letters
from five state governors, two state congressional delegations and
the Nebraska legislature in support of its proposed route between
Washington's Dulles International Airport and Tokyo, with a stop at
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.
   American is seeking approval for an identical route and says it
hopes economic and competitive issues hold more sway with the
Transportation Department than politicians' endorsements.
   The letters of support have been sent to John J. Mathias, a
Transportation Department law judge who will conduct hearings
expected to result by Oct. 1 in the selection of six new U.S.
``gateways'' for non-stop flights to Japan, United said in a
statement. The hearings are scheduled to begin Tuesday in
Washington.
   A gateway is the departure point for a non-stop flight. Chicago
would be the U.S. gateway for United's proposed flight.
   United spokesman Joe Hopkins said a number of airlines are
proposing multiple routes, but United is concentrating on only one
in what amounts to an all-out effort to stop American from further
humiliating United on its home turf.
   Hopkins said Dallas-based American also has proposed a non-stop
Chicago-Tokyo route, setting up a head-to-head contest for the
connection between the nation's two largest airlines.
   ``We're putting all of our efforts into this one,'' Hopkins said.
   American, a subsidiary of AMR Corp., pulled ahead of United in
sales and market share last year to become the nation's largest
airline.
   Barry Clark, manager of American's international route strategy,
said that since United already is the leading trans-Pacific carrier
among U.S. airlines, competition would be better served if the
Transportation Department awarded the route to American. As for
United's political connections, ``we obviously hope it's not that
terribly important,'' Clark said in a phone interview.
   American has been expanding and advertising aggressively in
Chicago during the past year, trying to make a splash here while
the management of United's parent, UAL Corp., has been caught up in
a long-running battle for control of the company.
   UAL's board of directors recently agreed to sell the company to
its employees for about $4.4 billion, but financing for the deal
hasn't yet been completed.
   It is possible that neither airline would get the route, since
Northwest Airlines and Japan Air Lines already fly between Chicago
and Tokyo. But it is virtually certain that United and American
won't both get authority for the route.
   Supporting United are Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson, Indiana
Gov. Evan Bayh, Kentucky Gov. Wallace G. Wilkinson, Nebraska Gov.
Kay A. Orr and Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder.
   Other politicians backing United's bid include Chicago Mayor
Richard M. Daley, the 24-member Illinois congressional delegation,
Indianapolis Mayor William H. Hudnut III, the Nebraska legislature
and the 12-member Virginia congressional delegation.
   UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf said in a statement that the
politicians ``speak not only for themselves but for the
constituents in their areas with strong interest in a more
efficient air link with Japan.''

<TEXT>
   Premark International Inc., maker of Tupperware
and West Bend products, said it has agreed to buy Sikes Corp., the
third-largest U.S. maker of ceramic tiles, in a deal worth $215
million.
   for $201 million in cash.
   Premark will pay $201 million in cash for Sikes and assume $14
million of the company's debt, Premark spokesman Bob Matha said.
   Sikes, based in Lakeland, Fla., reported net income of $7.4
million on sales of $137 million in its fiscal year ended Feb. 28.
The results included $2.4 million in charges for restructuring,
renovation and plant remodeling.
   In a statement from its headquarters in Deerfield, Ill., Premark
said it was commencing a tender offer to buy Class A common shares
of Sikes for $16.40 in cash and Class B shares for $26.78.
   Premark said the Class B shareholders also own about 9 percent
of the Class A shares, which they have agreed to tender to Premark.
   The deal is subject to antitrust clearance.
   Premark also announced Monday that its net income fell 41
percent in the first quarter to $13.2 million, or 39 cents a share,
from $22.4 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose
3 percent to $620 million.
   Chairman Warren L. Batts said the company had lower profits from
Tupperware and from its food equipment group, which includes the
Hobart, Vulcan and Foster brands.

   A federal bankruptcy judge Monday
authorized Braniff Inc. to sell its trademarks, flight certificates
and operating manuals to a former investor who wants to use them to
start up his own airline.
   Jeffrey Chodorow, a major Braniff stockholder from Philadelphia,
paid $313,333 for the documents required by the federal government
to operate an airline, according to court documents cited by The
Orlando Sentinel.
   Chodorow recently formed BN Air Inc. in New York. He has said he
will use Braniff's flight certificates to start an airline in
Dallas.
   BN Air wants to initiate scheduled and charter operations
utilizing the Braniff name and former Braniff employees, the court
documents disclosed. BN Air intends to begin flight operations in
late summer, subject to regulatory approvals.
   Braniff said in a news release that some Braniff employees will
be offered jobs with the airline within the next two weeks.
   Braniff, which went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy last Sept. 28, is
slowly disposing of its assets and employees. The Orlando-based
airline has about 95 employees remaining on its payroll and expects
to reduce its work force even further in the next week.
   Chodorow said further details on BN Air's plans would be
released within the next two weeks.

   A coalition of physically handicapped and
homebuilders complained on Monday that proposed guidelines designed
to guarantee disabled people access to apartments would price many
of them out of the market.
   However, those assertions were promptly denied by the government
and another group representing the disabled.
   The guidelines were described as ``impractical, inflexible and
too costly'' in an analysis by the Task Force on Handicap
Accessibility formed by the National Coordinating Council on Spinal
Cord Injury and the National Association of Home Builders.
   Gordon Mansfield, assistant secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, questioned the task force figures.
   ``We are very concerned that we meet the intent of the law and
make sure that (Secretary) Jack Kemp's priority on affordability on
housing be paid attention to,'' Mansfield said.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development is required by
the 1988 Fair Housing Amendments to issue guidelines insuring
disabled persons have easy access to new multi-family units first
occupied after next March 13.
   They affect such things as door hallway widths, bathroom and
walk-in pantry sizes and grading and ramping of steeply sloped
sites.
   But the task force study said draft guidelines ``go far beyond
the original intent of the Fair Housing legislation.''
   Unless modified, it said, costs of building rental apartments
and condominium and cooperative units ``will increase signficantly,
further slowing an already depressed multi-family industry and
exacerbating the affordability crisis currently confronting
millions of low- and moderate-income households.''
   ``We estimate that the cost per unit of meeting HUD's proposed
guidelines will range from $1,300 to $3,700 for walk-up units and
from $3,200 to $4,250 for mid- to high-rise units,'' R. Jack
Powell, president of the spinal cord injury council and executive
director of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, told a news
conference.
   Since the added costs would be added to rents, it would mean
monthly increases of $13 to $37 for walk-up units and of $32 to $43
for mid- or high-rise units, the coalition's study contended.
   The coalition said its proposed guidelines would mean increases
of between $7 and $26 for walk-up units and $14 to $23 for mid- or
high-rise apartments.
   ``If HUD's design guidelines result in significant increases in
the cost of housing, they we have really defeated the purpose of
the Fair Housing Amendments ... and created another barrier to
accessibilty,'' Powell said.
   Mansfield, however, said the HUD guidelines would increase the
cost of a $50,000 apartment by 1 percent, or $500, which both HUD
and the task force agree is within the cost that Congress intended.
   Bonnie Milstein, cochair of the Housing Task Force of the
Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, also said the
coalition's claims were inaccurate.
   Ms. Milstein said the coalition figures include expenditures not
required by the Fair Housing amendments and added that, while the
HUD guidelines are far from perfect, they are supported by her
organization which includes the United Cerebral Palsy, Easter Seals
and the American Foundation for the Blind.
   Kent W. Colton, Home Builders executive vice president, also
said uncertainty over the guidelines has severely disrupted the
multi-family construction industry which finished 1989 with only
373,000 building starts, down nearly 50 percent from 1985 and the
lowest level since 1975.
   Mansfield said the guidelines are now being considered by the
Office of Management and Budget whose approval is required for many
government regulations.
   The Home Builders is a federation of more than 800 construction
associations with more than 157,000 members. The coordinating
council is comprised of 17 organizations associated with spinal
cord injuries. The largest is the Paralyzed Veterans with 14,000
members.

   Hundreds of environmentalists demonstrated Monday in the
financial districts of New York and San Francisco, where post-Earth
Day demonstrators shattered windows at the Bank of America.
Authorities said 268 people were arrested in the two cities.
   Also in California, hand-delivered messages claimed
responsibility Monday for vandalism that cut power to some 92,000
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric customers in Santa Cruz and Watsonville.
   In New York, police arrested about 204 of an estimated 700
demonstrators. Two protestors were charged with assaulting an
officer and the rest with disorderly conduct, according to police
spokesmen.
   ``The major corporations have committed a lot of crimes against
nature,'' said Marc Chernoff, 30, a member of New York's Coalition
for a Nuclear Free Harbor. ``It's long overdue to place the blame
where it directly belongs. If the products that pollute were not
made available, people would not buy them.''
   Trade on the New York Stock Exchange went on as scheduled and
none of the protesters got inside. ``Except for getting up a little
early, it's a pretty normal day,'' said the exchange's senior vice
president, Richard Torrenzano.
   At the Pacific Stock Exchange in San Francisco, 49 people were
arrested during a demonstration by 300 to 500 protesters that
turned violent when some broke windows at Bank of America, threw
golf balls, rocks and eggs at police, and overturned newsstands.
   The exchange also opened on schedule although some employees
were delayed.
   Police closed off two blocks of Wall Street to traffic and all
pedestrians except those working there. Traffic elsewhere was
disrupted during the morning and afternoon when protesters walked
through lower Manhattan streets.
   The protest was organized by Earth Day Wall Street Action, which
described itself as a coalition of 60 environmental organizations
in the United States and Canada. It said it wanted to focus
attention on ``institutions responsible for much of the ecological
devastation which is destroying the planet.''
   ``I don't know why they're protesting against Wall Street,''
said James F. Dean, 24, an auditor with J.P. Morgan. ``I don't
think anyone is taking this seriously besides them.''
   ``I think it's great that these guys in suits are stopping to
hear us,'' said Debbie Augustine, 34, of Loudon, N.H., a member of
the anti-nuclear power Clamshell Alliance.
   A spokesman for the San Francisco demonstrators, Daniel
Finkenthal of the Earth Day Action Coalition, said the purpose of
the protest there was to give the public an alternative to the
corporate-sponsored views of environmental action that preceded
Earth Day.
   ``Yesterday these corporations came into our community and spent
a lot of money on a media coup to try to convince the American
public that environmental protection and reform was high on the
corporate agenda, but it's the lowest priority,'' Finkenthal said.
``In fact, they're spending more money on Earth Day promotion than
they are on actual corporate reform and the environment.''
   The group that claimed responsibility for the two California
outages called itself Earth Night Action Group and said the target
was Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, a ``corporate earth rapist.'' Residents
of Santa Cruz and Watsonville were affected by the outages Sunday
and early Monday, caused by damage to power PG&amp;E poles.
   A young male caller to The Associated Press telephoned a few
minutes after delivery of the message to ask if it had been
received. Similar messages went to Bay City News Service and the
San Francisco Examiner. The caller refused to give his name or his
telephone number.
