   Music publishers filed a class action lawsuit
on Monday against the Sony Corp., claiming the manufacturer's
digital audio tape machines promote illegal home taping of music.
   The lawsuit filed in federal court in New York City seeks to
block the importation and sale of the Sony DAT equipment. The
sophisticated machines, which yield near perfect duplications of
recorded music, went on sale in the United States last month.
   Sony is not the sole exporter of the machines but leads the
field.
   ``This equipment was truly designed and intended for the purpose
of infringing copy rights,'' said Marvin Frankel, an attorney
representing an estimated 40,000 songwriters and 450,000 copy
rights.
   ``Virtually everybody who is likely to buy this equipment will
be using it for infringement purposes,'' Frankel said.
   A call made after hours to Sony headquarters in New York was
unanswered.
   The lawsuit states that Sony is ``inaugurating a new era in
unauthorized home taping of copyrighted musical compositions.''
   The Japanese electronics giant, the suit alleges, is ``actively
promoting the ability of DAT recorders to make perfect digital
copies of compact discs.''
   The suit cites a recent survey sponsored by a music industry
trade organization showing that DAT owners intend to use the
equipment to tape pre-recorded music.
   Unlike analog tape recording machines, digital technology
provides for immaculate duplication of compact discs, and of
subsequent generations of DAT cassettes.
   The complaint asked the court to find that unauthorized DAT
taping violates the federal copyright statute. The suit maintains
such taping hurts sales of compact discs, cassettes and records,
costing the industry substantial copyright revenues.
   The lawsuit names Sony Corp., Sony USA Inc., and Sony Corp. of
America as defendants. It was filed on behalf of Sammy Cahn, Jac
Music Co. Inc., Fort Knox Music Inc., Trio Music Co. Inc., and Teer
International Inc.
   The announcement of the lawsuit's filing was made at the annual
meeting of the National Music Publishers Association. Edward
Murphy, president of the organization, said the group will offer
assistance to the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

   A Roman Catholic candidate for the state
legislature has been asked to resign from the parish council of his
church because he supports women's right to abortion.
   Monsignor William O'Donnell of Our Lady of Lourdes church in
Bethesda, Md., said Monday he had already accepted the resignation
of John Hurson, who is seeking election in a district where
abortion is a major campaign issue.
   Hurson denied that he had resigned.
   O'Donnell said he asked Hurson to quit the parish council
because ``his position was contrary to the teachings of the
church.''
   ``It's as simple as that. What's the big deal?'' O'Donnell said.
   Hurson said he opposes abortions, but does not believe the state
should pass laws against abortion.
   Richard Dowling, spokesmen for the Maryland Catholic Conference,
said this was the first time a public official or candidate in
Maryland or the District of Columbia had been disciplined for
taking a pro-choice stand on abortion.
   Hurson criticized church officials for trying to quell dissent
on the abortion issue.
   ``It seems to me that Catholics need to have, if they are going
to serve in public office, the freedom to represent everyone, not
just the Catholic hierarchy,'' he said.
   ``I want to participate fully in my church ... and the inability
to do that is very painful. One should not have to put one's
religion in low gear just because you decided to run for public
office,'' he said.
   Hurson, a lawyer, is running as a Democrat on a ticket headed by
Patricia Sher, one of the leaders of the abortion rights forces in
the Maryland House of Delegates.
   Sher is giving up her House seat to run in the primary against
Democratic state Sen. Margaret Schweinhaut, who supported a
filibuster in the Senate last March that blocked passage of a
strong pro-choice law.
   Hurson said he talked with O'Donnell twice last week to discuss
his abortion stance. He was told Friday that he would have to
resign.
   ``I told him, `You realize there's going to be some publicity
about this,''' Hurson said. ``He said, Oh, yes.'''

   Zsa Zsa Gabor has parted with the Rolls-Royce
she was driving when she had her infamous confrontation with a
Beverly Hills policeman.
   The 1979 Rolls-Royce Corniche sold for $90,000 at an auction
Sunday.
   Gabor sat in the convertible and patted the door affectionately
as auctioneers drove up the price Sunday.
   ``I don't like giving it up,'' she said after Leo Dutran of
Boston was announced the winning bidder.
   The 72-year-old actress was convicted of slapping a motorcycle
officer during a traffic stop last year in Beverly Hills. She was
sentenced to three days in jail and community service at a homeless
shelter.
   Another car sold Sunday was a 1957 Ford owned by ``Dallas'' star
Larry Hagman. It was bought by Richard Crane of Dallas for $37,500.
   ``I've got nine cars and my wife told me I had to sell one of
them,'' Hagman said.

   Hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky may be one of
the fastest men on ice, but apparently he gets stuck in traffic
like everybody else, so he's looking to move closer to work.
   Gretzky has put his Encino-area estate on the market for $3.25
million and is looking for a place closer to the Great Western
Forum, which is a dozen miles away in Inglewood.
   ``He wants to move closer to where he practices,'' said Asher
Dann, who has the listing on Gretzky's home.
   The arena is home to Gretzky's Los Angeles Kings. ``The Great
One'' has lived in the house since joining the team two years ago.
   The home was built in 1939 and once was owned by Oscar-winning
actress Teresa Wright. The 7,000-square-foot main house has six
bedrooms and five bathrooms.

   Gene Hackman has been released from a
hospital after he narrowly avoided a heart attack.
   Denise Tomasovic, spokeswoman for St. Vincent Hospital &amp; Health
Center, said Sunday the 60-year-old actor was released Saturday.
   Hackman, who lives in Beverly Hills, Calif., checked into the
hospital Tuesday with pain in his chest and arm. He had been
vacationing in Oregon after completing a movie in Europe called
``Dinosaur.''
   An artery leading to Hackman's heart had narrowed dangerously
and doctors had to dilate it with a balloon catheter.
   Dr. Herbert Semler, the cardiologist who treated him, said the
actor was in good health and could resume his active life.
   Hackman's most acclaimed role was the rough-and-tumble narcotics
cop Popeye Doyle in 1971's ``The French Connection.'' He won an
Oscar for that performance.

   Pearl Bailey will undergo surgery Wednesday
to replace her left knee.
   The 72-year-old entertainer was scheduled to enter Pennsylvania
Hospital today for a two-week stay, said hospital spokeswoman Laura
Feragen.
   Bailey suffers degenerative arthritis, in which the cartilage
covering the ends of bones and joints wears away, causing the bones
to rub together painfully, Ms. Feragen said.
   Ms. Bailey began her singing career in nightclubs and theaters
in Philadelphia in the 1930s before moving on to Broadway, where
she won a Tony for her role in ``Hello, Dolly.''

   Researchers already are complaining
about censorship at Richard Nixon's presidential library, which
opens this month.
   The privately run library will lack a full set of memos, letters
and other documents from Nixon's White House years because the
originals are in government custody, and Nixon has chosen to copy
only those he considers important to the library.
   ``Who knows what the Nixon people have screened out?'' said
Stanley Kutler, a Wisconsin history professor who recently
published a book on the Watergate scandal.
   The library's director, Hugh Hewitt, said every document of any
importance, including many relating to Watergate, will be in the
library.
   He also said the library will pick and choose researchers and
that Pulitzer Prize-winning Watergate reporter Bob Woodward
probably would not be allowed to study there.
   ``He's not a responsible journalist,'' Hewitt said.
   Woodward, now the Washington Post's assistant managing editor
for investigations, said the suggestion that he or others would be
kept out ``demonstrates that the library will be part of a
continuing cover-up.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Using Cable to Promote the Middle Ground</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Call it ``Just Us Folks,'' this new weekly
program on cable television channels across the country. But it
won't be a ratings threat to ``The Simpsons'' or to ``America's
Funniest Home Videos.''
   This show is intentionally mundane.
   Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., and a band of moderate Democrats say
they will take to the House floor regularly to correct what they
say is a public misperception. ``The Mainstream Forum,'' as they
call themselves, hopes to show that Democrats are plain folks, not
what McCurdy derisively calls ``the screamers'' of the extreme
right and left.
   ``I might even talk about my kids making the All-Star team in
baseball or softball,'' he said.
   The idea is to show voters that their Democratic congressmen are
much like themselves _ calm, thoughtful people who share their
concerns about tax fairness, crime, budget reality and the
country's security, he said.
   ``We will not be as wild in our rhetoric, or as provocative or
daring or outright hostile,'' McCurdy added. ``We are not going to
disparage individuals or personalities. That's part of the
message... We want to show people we're not extreme, we're not
crazy.''
   Joining him will be lawmakers like Barbara Kennelly of
Connecticut, John Spratt of South Carolina, Mike Espy of
Mississippi, Louise Slaughter of New York and Tim Penny of
Minnesota.
   McCurdy and his allies are members of the Democratic Leadership
Council, an organization of moderate-to-conservative Democrats
formed to try to move the party toward the right, into what they
see as the country's mainstream.
   The idea of using the House floor _ and its video connection to
hundreds of thousands of viewers _ after business hours first came
to the Republicans. It was Newt Gingrich and his Conservative
Opportunity Society who began staging issues discussions in 1984.
   Democrats thought it was silliness. Then-Speaker Thomas P.
``Tip'' O'Neill's response was to order the TV cameras to pan the
chamber and show that the intense-looking GOP debaters were
actually speaking to an empty House.
   But the televised mock debates did have an impact. Democrats
were portrayed night after night as not caring about issues like
the federal budget deficit and ignoring matters such as school
prayer, abortion, and the line-item veto. And they began to be
concerned that people might actually believe it.
   The party's next response, soon abandoned, was to consider a gag
order that would limit how many hours could be devoted to the
after-hours talkfests, known as ``special orders.'' In the
meantime, Gingrich, of Georgia, rode his TV visibility to become
House GOP whip, the No. 2 leadership position.
   Later, an informal group of Democratic activists, mostly
liberals, began meeting to define and refine a public message for
the party. They worked mostly through newspaper reporters,
columnists and TV commentators, however.
   Then McCurdy and about a dozen other Democratic moderates
decided it was time to fight fire with fire, and won the
acceptance, if not the blessing, of Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   ``We've got news for the minority whip and his minions,''
McCurdy announced in the maiden broadcast late last month. ``Their
free ride is over. We're not going to let them define us anymore.''
Nor, the Oklahoman added in an interview, will that job be left to
party liberals or interest groups.
   That McCurdy should now seize upon using the House floor,
available in more than 50 million homes through the C-SPAN cable
network, is taken as a compliment by Gingrich. He even hopes the
two opposing sides can be turned into a kind of point-counterpoint.
   ``We always thought that something like our use of C-SPAN was
inevitable, and it was good, that it's healthy,'' Gingrich said.
``We've always encouraged Democrats to come over and debate because
it's just a lot more fun.''
   ``We are basically taking a page out of Gingrich's book,''
McCurdy concedes. ``I'm of a different generation'' than O'Neill,
who brushed aside the GOP TV tactic. ``Cable TV has become a
powerful voice.''

<HEAD>Fungus Saves Trees From Gypsy Moth Caterpillars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TRUDY TYNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nearly forgotten fungus is proving to be
deadly on voracious gypsy moth caterpillars and may be the weapon
that stops them from destroying trees nationwide.
   ``It's such a brand-new phenomenon that we really know little
about it,'' said Joseph Elkinton, a professor of entomology at the
University of Massachusetts and the state's chief gypsy moth
researcher. ``We didn't even realize the fungus existed until last
year.''
   Elkinton and his counterparts in Connecticut, southern Vermont
and New York said that they had expected to be hard hit by the
caterpillars this spring. Instead they found healthy trees and dead
and dying caterpillars infected with the fungus entomophaga
maimaiga.
   Up to 90 percent of the caterpillars in some areas of western
Massachusetts that Elkinton checked were wiped out by the Japanese
fungus. The fungus was introduced in Boston in 1910 in the hope of
imposing a natural control on the gypsy moth.
   The hairy brown caterpillars of the gypsy moth, a European
species, have been munching on American oaks and other hardwoods
since some escaped from a French naturalist who was experimenting
with silk worms in Medford in 1869. Since then they have spread
across the country to the Pacific. Major defoliation has been
reported this summer in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, West
Virginia, Maryland, Ohio and Michigan, according to the U.S. Forest
Service.
   But while it took only 20 years after the moth's release in
Massachusetts for the first major infestation to be reported, it
was more than 80 years before the fungus was noticed last summer by
researchers in Connecticut and identified by Ann Hajek, of Cornell
University's Boyce Thompson Institute.
   ``Initially we thought it was because of the extremely wet
spring last year,'' she said. ``But that hasn't been true this year
in New York and we are still seeing it.''
   May was wetter across most of the region. But June, when the
caterpillars began dying off from the fungus, was not, Elkinton
said. Ronald Weseloh, a researcher at the Connecticut Agricultural
Research Station, agreed.
   Studies of the rise and fall of gypsy moth caterpillar
populations in Massachusetts, which has been charting their raids
for more than a century, showed they do well in dry years and die
off in wet ones. ``We never knew why, but the fungus may be the
answer,'' Hajek said.
   Armed with soil infected with the fungus, Hajek introduced the
fungus to an area around Ithaca, N.Y., where it killed caterpillars
this spring.
   ``So we know it can be brought into a new area effectively,''
she said. ``But there is still a lot to be learned about its spread
and effectiveness.''

<HEAD>U.S. Officials Say No U.S. Troops Would Be Used In Reported Drug
Raid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are stopping short of denying a
report of plans for a U.S.-coordinated military attack on drug
lords in South America, but say there has been no change in the
policy of not involving U.S. forces in direct operations.
   Newsweek reported Saturday it has obtained briefing papers from
U.S. Southern Command headquarters in Panama that envision an
attack coordinated by the Southern Command and using the armies of
Colombia, Bolivia and Peru to attack drug-trafficking targets in
those countries.
   National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft said on CNN's
``Newsmaker Sunday'' that it would be a ``real misnomer'' to refer
to the operations as a ``big drug raid'' as suggested by an
interviewer.
   ``U.S. troops will be used the same way they've always been
used,'' he said. ``That is, when asked for they will help train
local military. They will not be used operationally. In
interdiction and intelligence, for example, in tracking and so on,
yes, we will use the military, as we have been doing it all along.''
   Asked whether the reported operation signals an escalation of
the drug war, Scowcroft said: ``No. Well, hopefully, it's an
intensification, it's not an escalation.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney did not respond directly when
pressed on CBS' ``Face the Nation'' to comment on specifics of the
Newsweek account.
   ``I suppose you could argue that at present you've got a
situation where the military units in those countries are actively
involved in fighting the drug cartel and we are actively involved
in supporting them ... by coordination and support and
assistance,'' he said.

<HEAD>Study: Hundreds of Thousands Confronted By Criminals With Handguns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 639,000 Americans are confronted
each year by criminals carrying handguns, including 9,200 people
who are killed and 15,000 left wounded, according to a Justice
Department report.
   The study, released Sunday, of crime statistics covering 1979
through 1987 showed that 44 percent of all people murdered during
the nine-year period were killed by assailants wielding handguns.
   Guns were used in 7 percent of the rapes, 18 percent of
robberies and 22 percent of the aggravated assaults during the
period considered by the department's Bureau of Justice Statistics.
   The study was based on victims' reports taken by the
department's annual National Crime Survey. It did not break down
the figures by state or city.
   In an average year during the period, there were 9,200 murders,
12,100 rapes, 210,000 robberies and 407,600 assaults committed by
criminals with handguns, the Justice Department said. An average of
15,000 people a year are wounded by assailants possessing handguns,
the agency said.
   Fifty-one percent of the murders and non-negligent manslaughters
committed by people with handguns occurred when shots were fired
during an argument or a fight, according to the study.
   It said also that 25 percent of such killings took place during
the commission of another crime.
   In an average year, the Justice Department said approximately 27
percent of the 2.3 million crimes involving weapons of any sort
were committed by people with handguns. Other types of guns
accounted for 8 percent, or 180,100 of such crimes.
   Seventy-two percent of the handgun crimes were committed by
people who were strangers to the victim, the department said.
Acquaintances carrying guns committed 17 percent of those crimes.
Relatives of the victim committed 5 percent of handgun crimes. The
other 6 percent were in the ``unknown'' or ``unreported''
categories.
   Americans living in cities, particularly black men between the
ages of 16 and 24, were more likely to encounter criminals armed
with handguns, the study said.

   Miss Oregon pageant contestant Lisa Verch
says if she wins, don't drape her in mink.
   Rival beauty queens boast hobbies like collecting photos of
Elvis or porcelain dolls, hugging Dad, gourmet cooking and
horseback riding.
   On her fact sheet, Verch, 22, said her hobby is ``promoting the
ethical treatment of animals.''
   Her uncompromising animal rights activism puts her at odds with
a pageant sponsor, Schumacher Furs, which has awarded Miss Oregon
winners a mink jacket for 28 years.
   ``I'm committed so much to animal rights that I would do
anything rational and legal to support the cause,'' said Verch, a
member of Students for the Ethical Treatment of Animals at the
University of Oregon.
   That stance does not go over well with Bill Schumacher, a
longtime sponsor of the pageant to be held Thursday through
Saturday in Seaside.
   ``If one of them decides to turn down the mink coat,'' he said,
``I've got a packet of information that can show them how the
synthetics they're using in their tap shoes, evening gowns and
swimsuits are also hurting the environment.''
   Miss Oregon officials said Verch's views will not be held
against her.
   ``We plan on letting the contestants say what they want to
say,'' pageant president Mike Maki said. ``As for our sponsor,
we'll cross that bridge when, and if, we get to it.''
   By her own admission, Miss Lane County 1990 is an unlikely
beauty queen, calling herself a ``sweat shirts and jeans kind of
gal'' who rarely wears makeup and is a vegetarian.
   Verch said she considers the $6,000 in scholarships that go to
the pageant winner a good way to finance a master's degree in
journalism.
   Another incentive is the publicity that she could bring to
animal rights issues if she won the state contest and prevailed at
the Miss America pageant in September. Each Miss America promotes a
cause during her reign.
   Her moral stand was praised by game show host and former Miss
USA and Miss Universe pageant emcee Bob Barker, who in 1987 quit in
protest because officials refused to halt fur coat giveaways.
   ``She'll be admired by thousands for her convictions and is a
marvelous example of where America's young people today are heading
in their views,'' said Barker, a champion of animal rights.
   Leonard Horn, executive director of the Miss America Pageant,
said the organization would not put any restrictions on the topic
the winner chose for her platform.
   Verch, who works as an intern at radio station KEZI in Eugene,
will perform a piano medley of Bartok and Bach.
   She said if she's crowned Miss Oregon, she'll use the position
to lobby her cause in the state capital while serving as the
state's official hostess, a position designated by the Legislature
20 years ago.
   But don't expect her to show up in a fur coat.
   ``It goes against my personal values and beliefs in things that
I support every day of my life,'' she said.

<HEAD>Familiar Aromas Stimulate Memory, Studies Show</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The power of an odor to stimulate memory,
familiar to anybody who has suddenly thought of a long-lost lover
after getting a whiff of perfume or cologne, has proved itself in a
research laboratory.
   College students who smelled chocolate during a word exercise
and again the next day when asked to remember their answers did
better than others denied the memory-evoking aroma.
   Such an odor-based memory strategy could help students studying
for multiple exams or airline pilots training for emergencies, said
researcher Frank Schab.
   His work provides the first firm scientific evidence that odors
can help bring back memories, said Brian Lyman of the Monell
Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia.
   Schab, who did the experiments while at Yale University, now
does psychological research at the General Motors Research Labs in
Warren, Mich. He presents his results in this month's issue of the
Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition.
   ``People seem to believe from their own experiences that odors
are special, in the sense that they can recall very vividly events
from 20, 30 years ago,'' Schab said.
   Lyman said that unlike sights or sounds, odors are processed
through the brain's limbic system, which is involved in emotions.
That might help odors bring back memories with emotional overtones,
he said.
   In one experiment, 72 Yale undergraduates were presented with a
list of 40 common adjectives and told to write down the opposite of
each word. They were not told that the next day they would be asked
to recall as many of the words they had written as they could.
   Each student was exposed to a chocolate smell either during the
word exercise only, during the later recall test only, on both
occasions, or on neither. All students were told to imagine the
smell of chocolate on both occasions.
   Those who were exposed to the smell of chocolate during the word
exercise and again in the recall test recalled an average of 21
percent of the words they had written. That was significantly
better than the best average from the other groups, 17 percent.
   A follow-up experiment showed that the same odor must be present
upon learning and testing to get a memory benefit. No gender
differences appeared in the effect.
   Schab also found that chocolate and mothball odors worked
equally well, suggesting that the pleasantness of a smell does not
affect its power to stimulate memory.
   Such research has many potential applications, Schab said.
Students studying for exams in several subjects simultaneously
might benefit from using a different odor for each topic, he said.
   And using a particular odor when training pilots to handle an
emergency, and again when that emergency occurs, might ``bring back
a lot of information about how to do things, what to do next, what
to look for,'' Schab suggested.
   The experimental results fit a hypothesis, widely accepted by
psychologists, that some details about the environment in which a
person learns something are stored in the brain along with the
learned material. Such details can then be used to help retrieve
the material, the hypothesis says.
   For example, research shows students do better in exams if they
take them in the same rooms in which they learned the material,
Lyman said.
   Schab said he is now investigating whether odors work better
than other potential memory cues, such as music, sounds or the
rooms in which the learning occurred.

   A convention delegate from Michigan was
stunned when seven giggling teen-age girls burst into his hotel
room.
   The teen-agers were looking for the New Kids on the Block _ not
a 47-year-old delegate to the National Education Association
convention.
   ``I remember saying, `New Kids on the Block? What are you
talking about? You've got an old man in the bed here,''' said Larry
Chunovich, president of the Michigan Education Association and a
delegate to the National Education Association convention that
ended Sunday.
   The pop group performed Thursday night at Sandstone
Amphitheater. The girls barged into Chunovich's room about 1:30
a.m. Friday and told Chunovich that the pop group had stayed at
that hotel the last time they were in town.
   The girls had a key and thought they had the right room,
Chunovich said. He found out later they didn't even have the right
hotel.
   ``They were incredible,'' said Chunovich, who was staying on the
40th floor at the Hyatt Regency Crown Center. ``They were bound and
determined that their mission in life that evening was to find the
New Kids on the Block.''
   The five New Kids are known for their tightly choreographed
shows and their rabid teen-age following. Among the group's hits is
the current No. 1 single and album ``Step by Step.''

   A fourth of all Americans say they have
experienced discrimination at work, and nearly eight in 10 believe
some employers practice discrimination in hiring or promotion,
according to a poll.
   The national poll of a random sample of 803 adults was conducted
by telephone June 12-16 for The National Law Journal and Lexis, a
legal research service. The Journal reported the results in its
July 16 issue, released Sunday.
   Of those who reported discrimination, about a third said it had
to do with their sex. Another third said it had to do with their
race, religion or ethnic background. Most of the rest cited age or
a handicap.
   Of those who reported experiencing discrimination, 49 percent
said they took no action, 28 percent complained to their employer,
14 percent quit and the rest complained to the authorities or sued.
   The survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus about
3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Opening of East Bloc Means More Au Pairs in Wealthy Fairfield

<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crumbling of the Iron Curtain is
giving some wealthy Americans a new source of luxuries _ nannies
and au pairs from Communist countries.
   More than 50 men and women from the Soviet Union, Poland,
Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary arrived last month to work as
au pairs and camp counselors across the country under the auspices
of the Greenwich-based American Institute of Foreign Study.
   In the past, the organization, which provides camp counselors
and family companions for the summer, was prevented from recruiting
Eastern Europeans, said its president, Hank Kahn.
   Au pairs and nannies are a common commodity in Fairfield County
suburbs, where six-figure incomes and working couples are the rule
rather than the exception.
   A family pays $1,299 to the institute for a family companion for
10 weeks. Each au pair earns $40 a week plus room and board and
time off to travel in the United States.
   In Stamford, Simon Kravanja, a 23-year-old electrical
engineering student from Yugoslavia, is a summer companion for
8-year-old Morgan Patterson.
   Kravanja said he is impressed by the amount of open space and
the number of parks in Stamford. In his city of Ljubljana in
northern Yugoslavia, he lives in a 10th floor apartment with his
mother.
   He and Morgan spend much of their time at the Stamford Yacht
Club, where Morgan plays with his friends and Kravanja socializes
with other au pairs.
   Last year, Steve and Paula Patterson, both executives who
commute to Westchester, N.Y., hired a nanny from Michigan. Paula
Patterson said even the Midwesterner had to adjust to Fairfield
County life.
   ``This area is so different, even for an American,'' she said.
She calls herself a ``typical intense mother'' who updates her
son's summer schedule on a computer.
   ``In Fairfield County, we are very fast-paced and our
expectations are high,'' she said.

   A man accused of dunking his 2-year-old
stepson headfirst into a toilet goes on trial on murder charges
this week in a case that raised questions about social workers'
failure to protect the toddler.
   Prosecutors will seek the death penalty for Thomas Coe, who told
police he was punishing Bradley McGee for soiling his diaper. The
boy's death brought unprecedented charges against four social
workers, one of whom was convicted of child abuse.
   ``If nothing else, all this has made caseworkers be more careful
to realize they're making life-or-death decisions here,'' said Pam
Kirkland, the boy's foster mother before he was returned to Coe and
the mother who abandoned him. ``With every child, they have to stop
and ask _ `Could this be the next Bradley McGee?'''
   Coe, 23, goes on trial Tuesday in Fort Myers. Defense attorneys
have acknowledged the dunking but say Coe did not intend to kill
the boy, so it wasn't murder.
   ``We just want to make sure that if he's convicted, he gets
convicted for the crime he committed,'' said attorney Robert
Norgard.
   The case grew beyond domestic violence as Bradley's road from
abandonment to foster care and ultimately back into the hands of
his troubled parents made him a symbol of failings in the state's
social services system.
   The boy was under the supervision of the state Department of
Health and Rehabilitative Services from the time he was 4 months
old, after his mother abandoned him at a shopping mall with a
pretzel vendor.
   He died of head injuries July 28, 1989, two months after a judge
followed an HRS recommendation and ordered the child returned to
his stepfather and mother, Sheryl McGee Coe.
   The death prompted the Legislature last fall to allocate $39
million for more child protection workers. Legislators also changed
the law to make child safety, not family reunification, the social
services agency's top priority.
   According to Coe's statements to investigators, the dunking came
during potty training when Bradley dirtied his diaper.
   After Mrs. Coe took Bradley out in the yard and hosed him down,
Coe took him into the bathroom, grabbed the boy by the ankles and
dunked him in the toilet bowl.
   ``Plunger style,'' a detective wrote.
   When Bradley refused to stop screaming, he was put under a cold
shower, then led down the hall to the living room.
   Coe said he and his wife then hit the staggering Bradley in the
head with pillows until he suddenly stiffened, collapsed and curled
into a fetal position. Efforts to revive him failed.
   Both parents were charged with first-degree murder and
aggravated child abuse. Mrs. Coe, 21, pleaded no contest earlier
this year to second-degree murder and is serving a 30-year prison
term.
   Coe is described by relatives as a brooding, angry young man in
constant pain from a congenitally crippled hip and hereditary
kidney disease.
   In statements to prosecutors, Mrs. Coe said the toilet-dunking
was the culmination of a pattern of abuse by her husband against
Bradley. She claims he urinated on the child, put cayenne pepper on
his genitals and dunked him in the toilet at least once before.
   Defense attorneys argue Coe dunked the child to discipline him,
not to harm him.
   Within weeks of Bradley's death, charges were filed against four
state social workers. Three were cleared before Bradley's main
caseworker, Margaret Barber, 62, was convicted last month of child
abuse and placed on three months' probation.
   Ms. Barber had recommended that the boy be returned to his
parents without showing the court a psychological report that
described the Coes as explosive, infantile and unable to care for
children.
   ``I still lay awake at night and wonder how it could have
happened _ how it all could possibly have been prevented,'' said
Ms. Kirkland, who cared for Bradley for 14 months. ``There's no way
I can put it out of my mind.''

<HEAD>Dick Turpin Dead; First British Black Boxing Champion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dick Turpin, the first black fighter to win a
British boxing title, has died in his hometown of Leamington Spa at
age 69, newspapers reported today.
   Turpin was the eldest of three boxing brothers but did not
achieve the fame of Randolph Turpin, who beat Sugar Ray Robinson in
1951 for the world middleweight title. The other brother, Jackie,
was a successful featherweight.
   Dick and Randy Turpin rendered British boxing an ``inestimable
service,'' said The Times of London.
   The ring ability and popularity of the brothers ``made it
impossible for the British Boxing Board of Control to sustain its
iniquitous color bar against black boxers taking part in
championship contests,'' The Times obituary said.
   When the board relented, Dick Turpin won the British
Commonwealth title on May 10, 1948, knocking out Bos Murphy of New
Zealand in 2 minutes, 55 seconds. On June 28, he beat Vince Hawkins
on points to take the British middleweight title.
   Dick lost his Commonwealth title in September 1949 to Dave Sands
of Australia and his British title in March 1950 to Albert Finch.
He then retired and helped his brothers in their careers.
   Dict Turpin died Saturday. The cause of death was not reported.
   Jackie Turpin survives his brothers. Randolph committed suicide
in 1966.

Monrovia. Associated Press Correspondent Michelle Faul was among

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House-to-house fighting was reported in
the suburbs of the capital after rebels rejected a cease-fire offer
from besieged President Samuel K. Doe.
   Sources in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, who were in contact with the
front, on Sunday reported battles in Paynesville, eight miles from
the center of Monrovia. The suburb has been the scene of several
days of battles.
   But the sources said the fighting had slackened somewhat.
   Monrovians who ventured out Sunday found roads littered with
bodies. One resident said he saw the bodies of 16 civilians,
including two small children, near the capital's port.
   Soldiers have been accused of widespread looting and
indiscriminate killing.
   On Friday, Doe had broadcast a message from his heavily
fortified executive mansion saying a cease-fire had been arranged
in the six-month civil war in this West African nation of 2 million
people.
   But rebel spokesman Thomas Woewiyu said in Abidjan that the
rebels would not accept a cease-fire until Doe has left Liberia. He
said the rebels were prepared to discuss a transition government,
but it must be led by rebel chief Charles Taylor.
   Taylor is a strong supporter of capitalism, and he has wide
support in Liberia. But the United States and other governments
have questioned his commitment to democracy and free elections.
   Despite reports from Monrovia that Doe has agreed to leave if
his security and that of his Krahn tribal supporters is guaranteed,
the president has shown no sign he plans to depart soon.
   Doe has been deserted by most of his Cabinet ministers, the two
chief army commanders and dozens of other top officials. Government
troops appear demoralized and disorganized, and many have abandoned
their posts.
   But the rebels have had problems of their own. Residents
contacted by radio behind rebel lines in northern Liberia reported
infighting among rival commanders. A rebel faction led by Prince
Johnson reportedly ousted guerrillas of the mainstream National
Patriotic Front from an area in Bong County.
   The rebels invaded from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24 to overthrow
Doe's government, which they accuse of corruption and brutal
suppression of opposition.
   Monrovia's 500,000 people have been without water and
electricity for more than a week. Some were foraging for food
because markets and shops remained closed. Soldiers have been seen
shooting their way into stores.
   Doe, using a makeshift radio installed at his mansion, appealed
Saturday for calm, urging shopkeepers to open stores and people in
essential services to return to work. The broadcast said soldiers
caught looting would be executed.
   Hundreds of people have crowded into refugee compounds, some of
which are protected by Swiss personnel of the International
Committee of the Red Cross. Thousands have fled the country.
   Monrovia's main hospital has also been without power, water and
most of its staff since the rebels drew close to the capital.
   After the rebels invaded, Doe's forces killed hundreds from the
Gio and Mano tribes, the rebels' main support base. The rebels then
sought revenge by killing Krahn and Mandingo people, who have
supported Doe.
   Doe seized power in a bloody 1980 coup that ousted elitist
descendants of American slaves who founded this country in 1847.

   The U.S. dollar closed slightly lower against the
Japanese yen Monday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
firmed.
   The dollar closed at 150.70 yen, down 0.25 yen from last
Friday's close of 150.95 yen. The U.S. unit opened at 151.65 yen
and ranged between 150.67 yen and 151.70 yen.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues gained 93.16 points, or 0.29 percent, to close at 32,538.28
points.
   The dollar was bought in early trading because of
better-than-expected U.S. employment data released Friday, but
moved lower with many traders expecting U.S. interest rates to
ease, said Kohei Kuroda of Fuji Bank.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 86.86 points as of 11:15 a.m.,
down from Friday's close of 87.01. The yield stood at 7.220
percent, up from the previous day's 7.190 percent.

   Twenty-seven people were killed when a bus
following several cars whose drivers were rushing home to watch the
World Cup soccer final ran a red light at a rail crossing and was
hit by a train, Tass reported today.
   The official Soviet news agency said the accidednt occurred
Sunday at Petrozavodsk, 200 miles northeast of Leningrad. It quoted
the slightly injured driver as saying he mistook the traffic lights
for moonlight.
   Of the 50 bus passengers, 21 were killed instantly and six died
later of their injuries, Tass said.
   None of the train passengers or crew members were injured, it
said. An unspecified number of bus passengers were hospitalized
with injuries, it said.

<HEAD>Eight-Year Defense Agreement Signed By Greece, U.S.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greek and U.S. officials have signed a
defense treaty allowing two major U.S. military bases to remain in
the country for at least eight more years.
   The treaty signed Sunday also guarantees defense of Greece's
territory against any hostile country _ including neighbor and
fellow NATO ally Turkey.
   Greece and Turkey came to the brink of war in 1974 when Turkey
invaded Cyprus following an Athens-backed coup on the island. In
March 1987 the allies again came close to war over oil-drilling
rights in the Aegean Sea.
   The accord, which came after 19 rounds of negotiations and three
changes of government in Greece, must be ratified by the Greek
Parliament and the U.S. Congress. If the treaty is ratified, it
could go into effect by September.
   Greece's governing Conservatives control 151 seats in the
300-seat Parliament, the majority needed to ratify the agreement.
   ``This document provides a firm foundation for continuing our
bilateral defense relationship on mutually acceptable and
beneficial terms and will contribute to the strength of NATO,''
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said after the signing.
   Greek Foreign Minister Antonis Samaras and U.S. Ambassador
Michael Sotirhos signed the treaty, which can be extended by mutual
agreement on an annual basis after it expires.
   A draft letter to Congress calls for $345 million in aid for
Greece's purchase of U.S. military equipment. It also proposes that
Greece receive surplus materiel worth about $1 billion, Samaras
said.
   The United States also would waive $50 million owed by Greece
for past military purchases.
   A previous five-year defense agreement expired in December 1988.
Seventeen rounds of negotiations involving the former socialist
government of Andreas Papandreou produced no treaty.
   The Papandreou government, with its frequent anti-Western
rhetoric and links to such radical Arab leaders as Libya's Moammar
Gadhafi, did not enjoy much favor in the United States.
   Coalition governments after June and November elections last
year put the bases issue on hold.
   The conservative government, elected April 8, and the United
States reached agreement in principle on May 30 after two rounds of
talks.
   The treaty covers two major U.S. military bases on the southern
island of Crete _ a naval support facility at Souda Bay and
Iraklion Air Station near the village of Gournes.
   A Naval communications station at Nea Makri, and Hellenikon Air
Base, both near Athens, are to be closed to save money.

<TEXT>
   Fire today destroyed a Shinto shrine dedicated to
protected sacred rice being grown for the November coronation of
Emperor Akihito. Police said they suspected arson by anti-imperial
radicals.
   Far-left groups have vowed to disrupt the coronation,
criticizing it as a remnant of Japan's pre-war, emperor-centered
nationalism.
   No one was in Gogokuji Shrine when the fire broke out, the Akita
prefectural police said. A police official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said three batteries and an aluminum can were found
nearby, suggesting the fire was set.
   The three main wooden buildings of the shrine, 280 miles north
of Tokyo, were destroyed, the official said. The fire was
discovered by police on patrol before dawn.
   Police have been keeping a close watch on the shrine since Akita
was chosen by palace officials as one of two prefectures where
sacred rice would be grown for use in rites accompanying the
coronation.
   The sacred rice is to be used in the Daijosai, or ``great food
offering ritual,'' to be conducted ten days after Akihito's
coronation on Nov. 12.
   In that rite, legend says the new emperor communes with the
gods. Shinto, Japan's indigenous religion, is based on nature
worship, shamanism and elaborate ceremonial rites.
   Although the Daijosai will not be an official state function,
some opposition parties have said state funding for it violates
constitutional principles that separate church and state.

<HEAD>USDA Keeping Eye on British Cattle Disease</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The world's livestock industry is closely
watching Britain's ``mad cow disease'' situation for signs of a
beef turnoff in Europe and possibly other major meat-consuming
countries.
   Although the disease _ bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE
_ has not been known to exist in the United States, the Agriculture
Department and state agencies are keeping watch.
   The disease attacks the central nervous system and is fatal to
cattle. Department officials say there ``has been no scientific
evidence to date'' that it is a human health hazard.
   A report by the department's Economic Research Service said
recent decisions by France, Germany and Italy to stop imports of
British beef and cattle lasted only for a week.
   But the short-lived ban highlighted animal health issues as the
12-member European Economic Community moves ahead in its
``ambitious program to eliminate internal borders by the end of
1992,'' the report said.
   ``Such restrictions are contrary to (EEC) law,'' it said. ``But
the bans were lifted after intensive negotiations, signifying
another victory ... over national interests.''
   All beef with bones and live calves shipped from the United
Kingdom to other EEC countries must be certified that they are from
BSE-free herds. Boneless beef doesn't require certification.
   Since 1986, when the first cases were confirmed, 14,000 cattle
have contracted BSE in the United Kingdom.
   ``A number of British schools have stopped including beef in
school meals,'' the report said. ``Beef prices are depressed in
Britain and Ireland, and the (EEC) commission has decided to open
intervention buying of UK beef to help support prices.''
   The report was written by economists Mary Lisa Madell and David
Kelch of the USDA agency and published in the July issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   Madell said further in a telephone interview that so far BSE has
been found only in the United Kingdom. None has been reported on
the continent, although some cases have been reported in Ireland.
   But she said, ``There are people advising not to buy British
beef'' and that this has been of some growing concern to consumers
and producers alike.
   Outside the EEC countries, Austria and the Soviet Union have
banned imports of British ruminants, which include sheep as well as
cattle. Saudi Arabia and Qatar have stopped taking cattle and beef
from the United Kingdom.
   Australia, New Zealand, Israel and Canada have banned imports of
cattle from the United Kingdom.
   The USDA has prohibited imports of live cattle and zoo ruminants
from the United Kingdom since July 1989, and embryos and semen can
be imported only with special certifications.
   A U.S. import ban on sheep and goats has been in place for many
years because of the existence of scrapie in England. Scrapie is a
disease of sheep and is similar to BSE. Some scientists suspect BSE
was transmitted to cattle through feed containing meat of sheep
infected with scrapie.
   Madell said if the disease problem in Britain affects beef for
pet food, it could help boost U.S. exports of those products.
   ``But I wouldn't say that the situation in England is going to
produce a big demand for U.S. beef in Europe,'' she said. ``I don't
think it's going to open up major markets.''

   An Agriculture Department economist says
Japan's resistance to opening its door to rice imports has deep
roots.
   The United States has been pressuring Japan to abandon its
policy against rice imports as a step toward trade liberalization.
   William Coyle of the department's Economic Research Service said
Japan's ``agricultural policy is woven into the country's culture.''
   But Coyle added in the July issue of Farmline magazine that some
changes are taking place as urban dwellers' ties with the
countryside weaken, the yen appreciates in relation to other
currencies, and rural-urban competition for land intensifies.
   Coyle also noted some differences: Japan has 24 people per acre
of cropland, compared with 1.2 in the United States.
   Japan has 4 million farms averaging 3.25 acres each, compared
with 2 million averaging 463 acres in the United States.
   In terms of value, rice is the most significant Japanese crop,
followed by livestock products _ both meat and milk _ vegetables
and fruit. Japan is accustomed to importing foods other than rice,
and about 70 percent of the livestock feed is imported.
   Japan has had a policy of being self-sufficient in rice since
the 1940s. At the beginning of World War II, Japan was a rice
importer, and many older Japanese remember the food shortages
during and immediately after the war.

   Imports of beef and veal are expected to
increase only slightly, if at all, this year, according to
Agriculture Department forecasts.
   Most of the imports come from Australia and New Zealand, the
department's Economic Research Service said in a recent outlook
report. Shipments from Australia were larger than expected at the
end of 1989 and at the beginning of 1990.
   But those imports ``will likely decline during mid-1990 because
flooding has disrupted transport of cattle to slaughter in
Queensland, where most of the beef shipped to the United States is
produced,'' the report said.
   Imports from New Zealand probably will be down this year,
reflecting herd rebuilding and recovery from last year's drought
and herd liquidations.
   Last week USDA estimated meat imports in the 1990 calendar year
at 1.16 billion pounds, compared with slightly more than 1.14
billion pounds in 1989. The estimate covers meat _ primarily beef
and veal _ subject to annual quota restrictions if it appears
imports will exceed a trigger level.
   The trigger for 1990 is more than 1.36 billion pounds, meaning
that actual imports probably will fall far short.
   About a dozen countries supply quota-type meat to the U.S.
market, but Australia and New Zealand are the main providers.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson did little to dampen
speculation that he is considering another presidential run when he
made a two-day swing through Iowa to raise money for key backers of
his 1988 campaign.
   Jackson scored in the 1988 precinct caucuses by building links
between liberal farm activists and the state's small minority
community. He said he can do that again.
   ``Both of you have been taken advantage of, and it's time to
come together,'' Jackson said at a picnic Sunday with leaders of
Iowa's Farmers Union, which supported him two years ago. The event
was cosponsored by a black activist group.
   ``I'm delighted to be here with friends again,'' Jackson said.
``We've been through triumph together, we work together now.''
   But to persistent questions about his presidential ambitions,
Jackson replied, ``No one can stop you from speculating. It
happened that our invitations neatly converged.''
   During his weekend visit to raise money for state legislative
candidate John Norris, the man who ran his campaign in Iowa, and
gubernatorial hopeful Don Avenson, Jackson touched on rousing
populist themes.
   He told packed churches of ``a kind of virus of mindless
materialism'' behind the nation's drug crisis and savings and loan
fiasco.
   ``Its root is greed, we should have been focused as a nation on
a higher vision,'' Jackson said.
   ``If we can find $500 million for those savings and loan thieves
we can rebuild America,'' Jackson said of the savings and loan
bailout. ``I say let those who had the party pay for the party.''
   Jackson announced last week he would run for the post of
``shadow senator'' from the District of Columbia. The shadow
senators will be unpaid lobbyists for Washington, D.C., statehood,
with no official duties.
   Democratic activists were less oblique about Jackson's
intentions for 1992.
   ``Jesse already has a certain cadre who will help him in any
campaign in which he shows an interest,'' said Iowa Democratic
Party spokesman Joe Shannahan. ``It's probably time that he touches
base with his constituency.''
   Jackson's visit comes as Democrats stir in anticipation of
trying to oust President Bush in 1992. Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder
visited the state last month, and New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley is
scheduled to visit Iowa this summer. The state's precinct caucuses
offer the nation's first test of presidential strength.
   ``We defied the odds in 1988,'' Jackson said as he swung through
Greenfield in western Iowa. ``Greenfield, my home away from home.
The tone for the 1988 campaign was really set right here in rural
Iowa.''
   It was in that city that Jackson decided to establish his Iowa
campaign headquarters, although it was 60 miles away from Des
Moines and most media outlets. He said it symbolized his efforts to
link the fates of struggling inner-city workers and farmers facing
a credit crunch.
   Jackson said he can link those groups again.
   ``We must make room for each other, we must stand together,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Death penalty opponents in the United
States, Canada and Europe are rallying behind a condemned former
Black Panther, claiming his case is an example of racism in capital
punishment.
   Mumia Abu-Jamal of Philadelphia is on Pennsylvania's death row
for the fatal 1981 shooting of a white police officer. He was
convicted in 1982 and exhausted his state court appeals last year.
His latest appeal petition, filed in May, is pending before the
Supreme Court.
   ``The case has become the rallying cry for opponents of the
racist death penalty,'' said Rachel Wolkenstein, staff attorney for
the New York-based Partisan Defense Committee, organizer of
protests staged in London, New York, Paris, Hamburg, East Berlin
and Toronto.
   Studies have shown that the death penalty is disproportionately
applied to blacks, Hispanics, the poor and the indigent.
   Among the inmates on death row, 43 percent are black, more than
three times the percentage of blacks in the general population,
acording to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. More than
twice as many blacks who killed whites were executed since 1973 as
blacks who killed other blacks, according to the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   A rally is planned for July 12 in Sydney, Australia, followed by
others July 14 in Philadelphia, Chicago and Oakland, Calif.
   Petitions with 20,000 signatures seeking a reprieve for Jamal
have been sent to Gov. Robert Casey, along with a letter from the
Toronto Labour Council on behalf of 180,000 trade unionists in
Canada.
   ``This campaign has brought together a powerful array of
forces'' who want an end to death sentences, said Gene Herson,
rally chairman for the committee.
   U.S. Rep. Ronald V. Dellums, D-Calif., and actor Ed Asner are
among those supporting a lesser sentence for Jamal.
   ``In addition to my hatred of the death penalty ... I know that
Mumia did not have a fair trial,'' liberal attorney William
Kuntzler said during a June 28 rally in New York.
   Deputy District Attorney Gaele Barthold said prosecutors would
have no comment because Jamal's case is in litigation.
   Witnesses testified that Jamal, 36, shot Officer Daniel Faulkner
once in the back and four times at close range after the policeman
stopped Jamal's brother for a traffic violation. Jamal was
critically injured when Faulkner returned fire, and later recovered.
   Jamal, formerly known as Wesley Cook, was a member of the Black
Panthers and later became a supporter of the radical group MOVE and
a follower of the Rastafarian movement.
   He was a radio news reporter known for his focus on social
issues and served as president of the city Association of Black
Journalists. He lost the radio job in a dispute over objectivity
and was working as a taxi driver before the shooting.
   Ms. Wolkenstein contends Jamal had been a police target for
years.
   ``He's on death row specifically because as a Black Panther and
prominent journalist he spoke out against racist state
repression,'' she said.
   John O'Brien, recording secretary for the Fraternal Order of
Police, Lodge 5, said he had no knowledge of Jamal's having been a
police target, but he said the police union and its members would
fight any attempt to overturn Jamal's death sentence.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, that man deserves to die,'' he said.
``He killed that man on purpose. He could have left after shooting
him once, but no, he came over and put another bullet in his head.''
   Jamal, who claims he did not shoot the police officer, did not
testify at his trial.
   Defense attorney Marilyn J. Gelby has argued that the prosecutor
improperly told jurors Jamal would have ``appeal after appeal after
appeal'' if convicted. The state Supreme Court said the argument
was permissible, but the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a similar
ruling from Mississippi in 1985.
   Such an argument ``is seen to mean that the jury is really not
taking its responsibility for the death penalty,'' Ms. Gelb said.

<HEAD>U.S. Military Escalates Involvement in Bolivian Drug War</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon has sent in advisers to help
with an intensified anti-drug effort that includes a sophisticated
new intelligence-gathering system, a U.S. drug enforcement official
says.
   Bolivia, an impoverished South American country of 7 million
people, produces one-third of the cocaine consumed in U.S. and
other foreign markets.
   Eugene Castillo, acting U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
attache for Bolivia, said a computer system recently installed in
La Paz and Santa Cruz will link major cocaine centers and provide
data on trafficking.
   It will also provide a safe way of transmitting information
among anti-drug operations centers, he said.
   Castillo, who spoke Friday on condition the story would not be
used before Sunday, described the new system as ``innovative.''
   ``It gives us ... intelligence and the ability to transmit that
intellingence to affected areas so that operations can be planned
and mounted in a minimum amount of time,'' he said.
   Until now, the DEA and Bolivian police have relied on Korean
War-vintage radio equipment whose transmissions can easily be
intercepted by drug traffickers, who use the latest in radio
communications equipment.
   Castillo said the U.S. Southern Military Command is also helping
the DEA and Bolivian police ``formulate and maintain a country-wide
operational strategy'' to prevent the production and export of
drugs and the import of chemicals used in processing.
   For about a month, three military advisers _ one each from the
U.S. Navy, Army and Air Force _ have been coordinating strategy
with Bolivian police and the DEA. At least 10 other special agents
are training Bolivian anti-drug police.
   The U.S. military is prohibited by the Bolivian and U.S.
governments from directly participating in any anti-drug operations.
   ``The military is only a support force,''' Castillo said. ``All
we are doing is using military expertise to assist us in
intelligence gathering.''
   During a May meeting in Washington, Bolivian leader Jaime Paz
Zamora and President Bush agreed on greater military involvement in
the anti-drug war.
   Paz Zamora agreed to commit 900 soldiers to the effort and to
increase air force and navy involvement. Bolivian military
personnel are already assisting police in anti-drug activities.
   In return, Bolivia was promised $75 million worth of military
equipment and training for 1990-1991.
   But the growing militarization of the anti-drug war has created
opposition in Bolivia and raised concern that a largely peaceful
police enforcement effort could escalate into civil wars such those
in Peru and Colombia.
   ``The participation of the military in coca-producing zones ...
is only producing violence,'' said Felipe Caceres Garcia, a leader
of the coca growers association of Chapare. The region the size of
New Jersey produces 80 percent of Bolivian coca leaves, the base
for cocaine.
   ``In Bolivia, there is no violence, there is no terrorism and we
do not want it to get to that,'' Caceres Garcia said.

   Mikhail Gorbachev and trade feuds aren't the only
hot topics on Houston's summit menu.
   At the Goode Co. Bar-B-Q barn, loyalists were simmering over the
rival stuff the folks tasted at Sunday night's presidential hoedown
for his summit guests. George Bush probably would agree. His
favorite, Otto's, wasn't served up, either.
   In Houston, barbecue is a serious subject and a never-ending
source of argument. ``We're the best,'' boasted Goode Co. manager
Tanguy Libbrecht. ``Otto's is arguably one of the best-known
because George Bush plugs it. I've got nothing bad to say against
Luther's, but everyone know's we're the best.''
   Luther's Bar-B-Q, a popular chain that sports red-and-white
check tablecloths and curtains and boasts a ``Taste as Big as
Texas,'' donated all the food at Bush's summit feast for 5,000
people. The spread included 1,250 gallons of barbecue sauce, 500
pounds of onions and a jalapeno or two.
   Luther's President Mike Jolley, naturally, claims his barbecue
is the best in the world, but Houston Magazine awarded its blue
ribbon to the Goode Co., where deer heads, rifles and longhorns
hang on the walls and strains of country music fill the smoky air
with tales of love won and lost.
   Jim Woods, 65, drove 20 miles across town to eat at Goode Co.
Sunday night, while foreign dignitaries dined in a building
adjacent to the Astrodome.
   ``People talk about where the best barbecue is a lot,'' Woods
said. ``I think this is the best.''
   Bush favors Otto's, which couldn't cater the rodeo because it
couldn't handle a party that large, but did send dinner over to
Barbara Bush last week.
   ``Everyone does their own thing. It's all competitive, and
there's no bad-mouthing,'' said Marcus Sofka, who runs Otto's.
   None of the barbecue aficionados in a Houston Post survey of
prominent Houstonians favored Luther's. Otto's was No. 1 according
to Houston defense attorney Richard ``Racehorse'' Haynes, state GOP
Party Chairman George Strake and Japanese Consul General Yasuo Hori.
   Sofka says his is supreme because he leaves the fat on the beef
while it is slow-cooked over wood and basted in sauce. Luther's
trims some of the fat, he said.
   Across town in one of the poorer neighborhoods, Thomas' Bar-B-Q
gets high marks.
   ``There's nothing fancy about this place. Just good beef,'' said
Wilma Alexander.

   The dollar declined slightly against the Japanese
yen today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index closed higher.
   After opening at 151.65 yen, the dollar slipped to 150.70 at the
close, down 0.25 yen from Friday's close of 150.95 yen. It ranged
between 150.67 yen and 151.70 yen.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues gained 93.16 points, or 0.29 percent, closing at 32,538.28.
The index had gained 93.45 points Friday.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 400 million shares,
down from 462 million shares Friday.
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered gainers 476 to 468, while
178 issues remained unchanged.
   Dealers said the dollar opened higher and was bought in early
trading because U.S. employment figures reported Friday were a
little better than expected.
   ``But it moved lower, with many traders expecting U.S. interest
rates to ease, after it was reported that U.S. Treasury
Undersecretary (David) Mulford has welcomed the yen's recent
recovery,`` said Kohei Kuroda of Sumitomo Bank.
   Stock dealers said market activity was slow due to a lack of
fresh news, and profit-taking checked gains throughout the day.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 87.05 points as of 5 p.m. from
Friday's close of 87.01. The yield stood at 7.180 percent, down
from the previous trading day's 7.190 percent.

<HEAD>Teachers Union Convention Closes With Cooperation Pledge From Feds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest teachers union
closed its annual convention with lofty education reform goals and
a cooperation pledge from the federal government.
   Department of Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos sent ``warmest
greetings'' to the National Education Association Sunday, signaling
a possible end to friction with the 2 million-member union dating
back to the Reagan administration.
   Cavazos said he would work closely with the union to improve
schools.
   First-year union president Keith Geiger gaveled the convention
to a close with high hopes for U.S. public education.
   ``I think we're ready to move ... in a direction that I laid out
on the first day,'' Geiger said, referring to a batch of proposals
presented to 8,100 delegates.
   Those proposals included creating a $2.2 billion program to give
needy elementary children special assistance weeks before the start
of school, urging public schools to take on preschool and day-care
programs and advocating major changes in teacher education programs.
   Geiger also said he would seek extra federal money for education
from anticipated defense spending savings.
   The union's policies on abortion issues were challenged on the
convention floor, but spirited discussions were good-natured,
Geiger said.
   ``Debate this year is on a level that I've never heard it
before,'' he said. ``The antagonism isn't there. I think the
delegates feel real good. They have dealt with the issue outright.''
   Delegates soundly defeated all the challenges to its positions
in favor of abortion rights.
   They voted Sunday against an attempt to change the union's
support of family planning, ``including the right to reproductive
freedom.''
   Also, they voted to oppose any legislation that erodes the
status of the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade abortion rights
ruling or tries to impede access to information on ``choice of
reproductive health care options.''
   Undaunted, Robert Pawson, head of Teachers Saving Children, said
he would keep pursuing efforts to ``reform the NEA from within.''
   Kathleen Holzmeister of the Illinois Education Association lost
an effort to forbid abortion counseling at community-operated,
school-based family planning clinics.
   On Saturday, delegates easily defeated an attempt to stop the
union's policy of lobbying for abortion rights.
   The NEA also agreed to write President Bush and Congress in
support of sanctions against South Africa until apartheid is
eliminated and to encourage continued divestments of pension funds
in companies doing business in South Africa.

<TEXT>
   The Museum of Fine Arts has plunged to old depths
to show why some of its more than 1.5 million works of art grace
its walls and others hang on racks behind steel doors in
underground rooms.
   ``Unlocking the Hidden Museum: Riches from the Storerooms''
gives museum-goers a chance to see what they haven't seen and may
not see again.
   ``I'm always eager to demystify the museum,'' said its director,
Alan Shestack. ``It's really a look, and a rather rare look, at the
submerged part of the museum iceberg.''
   Nearly 200 pieces have been moved to the iceberg's tip _
etchings by Rembrandt, paintings by Millet, figurines from Africa
and the Orient, scrolls, fabrics, furniture, fragments of ancient
sculptures. They will be in the Gund Gallery through Sept. 9.
   Authenticity, condition, quality, size and taste can make the
difference between display and storage.
   Side by side in this special exhibit are an 18th century
painting by Jean-Honore Fragonard and a copy by a contemporary, and
an authentic 8th century Chinese figurine and a modern fake.
   Some works such as a wire cow with 3{ legs by Alexander Calder
and an Edvard Munch lithograph faded by light are too fragile for
continuous display.
   Some pieces are considered too fragmentary for public viewing.
   Two tiny feet on a base are what remain of a small statue of
King Cheops, builder of the Great Pyramid at Giza. Identification
was made from the part of the cartouche still on the base.
   One section of the exhibit reflects how tastes change in
collecting and displaying art. A huge 19th century French painting
of a nude man with two rearing horses was highly praised at the
time and bought by the museum through public subscription 100 years
ago.
   This is the first time in decades that it's been shown.
   ``We're curious to see the reaction of today's public,'' said
Erica Hirshler, curatorial assistant in the Department of Paintings.

   Floods killed 27 people in three days in the
northern Chinese province of Shaanxi, an official report said today.
   Torrential rains that began Friday swept through 18 cities and
counties in northern Shaanxi, causing at least $63 million in
damage, the English-language China Daily said.
   Up to 7{ inches of rain fell in parts of Shaanxi, and thousands
of villagers were stranded when dikes along the Hanjiang River
broke, the report said. It quoted local officials as saying such
severe flooding happens only once every 20 years.
   Heavy rains also fell in northeastern, northwestern and southern
China, with rainfall in some places recorded at 4{ inches in a
24-hour period during the weekend, the paper said.
   Hailstones measuring up to 3 inches in diameter hit parts of
Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Heilongjiang and Hebei provinces in northern
and northeastern China.
   In southwestern China's Sichuan province, more than 10,000
people were left homeless in Guangyuan municipality. More than
7,750 homes in the city in northern Sichuan have collapsed and
123,500 acres of crops have been washed away, the paper said.
   An earlier report said four people were missing in the flooding.
   Today's Legal Daily newspaper reported 3,511 people injured or
dead in southern China's Hunan province since mid-June in heavy
rains and flooding.
   The report did not give a breakdown of the casualties, but
earlier reports said at least 254 had died and damage was put at
$359 million.
   So far this summer, at least 422 people have died in flooding,
including the latest casualties.

<HEAD>Police Hunt For Right-Wing Group Linked To Bombings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police hunted today for
members of a right-wing white group that has claimed responsibility
for a bombing that injured 27 blacks and is threatening more such
attacks.
   The group, calling itself the White Liberation Army, made the
claim late Sunday in a statement telefaxed to newspapers. The
bombing Friday was one of at least six in Johannesburg in the last
10 days.
   The message said the bombing, at a central bus terminal used
almost exclusively by blacks, was to protest government plans to
end white-minority rule. It was sprinkled with racial slurs and
called Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok a ``traitor.''
   Earlier Sunday, Vlok had announced the arrests of nine white
extremists in connection with the series of bombings, which were
aimed at black and anti-apartheid targets.
   Vlok called the nine men ``supporters of a far-right political
ideology'' but said they could not be linked to any specific group.
   A police official said today that police were searching for
members of the White Liberation Army. The official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said it was one of several extreme
right-wing groups linked to recent attacks.
   Vlok said the nine detained men were being held under the
Internal Security Act, which allows for indefinite detention
without trial. He did not say when they had been arrested.
   Among the nine were three prominent right-wingers, Leonard
Veenendaal, Darryl Stopforth and David Rootenberg. Vlok declined to
name the others.
   Right-wing whites have vowed to fight President F.W. de Klerk's
plans to end apartheid and share power with the overwhelming black
majority.
   Both de Klerk and the African National Congress, the leading
black opposition group, have acknowledged that a terrorist campaign
by heavily armed whites extremists could undermine black-white
negotiations.
   The ANC and other anti-apartheid groups have criticized police
for failing to solve any of the recent bombings. But Vlok said the
arrests showed the government was moving against the white
extremists.
   Officials believe the extreme right consists of only a few
hundred people, but security officials say even a handful of white
terrorists could cause havoc. South African press reports say up to
45 extreme-right groups operate in South Africa.
   Government officials say the right poses a far greater threat
than the armed struggle of the ANC and other black organizations.
The ANC campaign, which began in 1961, was largely ineffective
because of the group's internal problems and the superior strength
of South African forces.
   Terrorism by whites is likely to be much more effective and
dangerous, security officials said. Nearly all white men receive
compulsory military training. Guns and explosives are readily
available to whites and the right has numerous sympathizers in the
police and military, they said.
   It also is much easier for white extremists to operate without
suspicion in a society with laws that give privileged status to
whites.
   The pro-apartheid Conservative Party says it plans to defy a
government law requiring public facilities to open to all races by
October, the independent South African Press Association reported.
   The measure, the Separate Amenities Act, gave local governments
and privately-owned enterprises the right to reserve facilities for
whites, such as parks, hotels, swimming pools, bathrooms and
recreation centers.

<HEAD>NAACP Executive Director Calls for Passage of Civil Rights Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black leaders gathered at the NAACP's annual
convention said winning passage in Congress of a major civil rights
bill is the group's top priority.
   The bill is needed to restore rights that were ``kidnapped by
the conservative majority on the current U.S. Supreme Court,''
NAACP executive director Benjamin L. Hooks said Sunday in a speech
opening a five-day meeting of the nation's oldest and largest civil
rights group.
   ``A vote for the Civil Rights Act of 1990 is a vote for the
continued emancipation of African Americans,'' Hooks said. ``A vote
against the bill is a vote for economic and social enslavement, and
the denial of equal opportunity for African Americans.''
   Hooks said the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People will launch a huge lobbying effort to promote
passage of the legislation.
   ``We will also apply these same efforts to ensure that President
Bush signs the measure,'' he said.
   The bill would reverse several U.S. Supreme Court decisions made
last year regarding the employment rights of women and minorities.
   ``Unless we are successful in reversing the Supreme Court's
turn-back-the-clock actions, we may again find ourselves _
literally and figuratively _ on the back of the bus,'' Hooks said.
   In a news conference before the meeting, Hooks complained that
black elected officials have been subjected to selective
prosecution, and he called for uniform enforcement of the law.
   He was particularly critical of the federal government's drug
sting of Washington Mayor Marion Barry using a woman with whom he
had an affair to lure him to her hotel room.
   ``We feel that something is wrong with the system when millions
of dollars are spent and over 70 FBI agents assigned to trail and
monitor an elected official, to set up a sting operation to bring
him down, and then to have America's chief law enforcement officers
say afterwards that due to limited resources, no criminal
investigation will be launched against 1,600 greedy savings and
loan bank officials who have stolen over $500 billion,'' Hooks said.
   Hooks emphasized that the NAACP does not condone misconduct by
public officials but charged that black officials have been
unfairly targeted for prosecution.
   ``Tremendous amounts of money and resources have been expended
to hunt down every allegation, innuendo, rumor or hint of possible
wrongdoing on the part of black elected officials,'' he said.
``Overzealous, hostile _ if not racist _ district and U.S.
attorneys will bring a black official to trial on the flimsiest
evidence.''

<TEXT>
   Plans to free a Western hostage are
likely to proceed despite Israeli air raids in Lebanon, a source
close to the leadership of the Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem group
Hezbollah said today.
   Most of the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon are held by
underground factions believed to be supported by the Hezbollah, or
Party of God. Hezbollah bases were the targets of air strikes in
south Lebanon today and Sunday.
   ``Let us pray the Israeli attacks will not scuttle efforts to
free one of the hostages,'' said the source, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   ``The hostage-holders are definitely restless, but I personally
believe Iran's pressure will probably override the impact of the
attacks,'' he said.
   Iran's official news agency had reported Saturday that one of
the Western hostages in Lebanon, most likely a European, would soon
be freed.
   On Sunday, Israeli jets hit a Hezbollah base three miles north
of Israel's self-declared security zone. Today, police said four
Phantom F-4 fighter-bombers rocketed Hezbollah bases two miles
north of Sunday's targets.
   A source close to the command of the Syrian troops in Beirut
said if the release does occur, it is unlikely to be before the
middle of the week. The Syrians were instrumental in working out
the releases in April of two American hostages, Frank Reed and
Robert Polhill.
   ``We haven't been contacted yet about arrangements of the
release. It usually takes two to three days after such contact to
have the hostage out,'' the source said Sunday, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Syria is Lebanon's main power broker. It has 40,000 troops in
the country, controlling 70 percent of its territory.
   On Sunday, a source close to Hezbollah said Iran had decided to
use its influence with the kidnappers to free one of the hostages,
and a scenario for the release was being worked out.
   ``The decision was made in Tehran to release the hostage. The
details on where, when and how are now under consideration in
Lebanon,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The source would not speculate on who would be released, or
answer any other questions.
   ``We have to wait for a communique (from the kidnappers),'' he
said.
   Moslem fundamentalists accuse Western governments, especially
the United States, of bias toward Israel and hold them responsible
for Israel's actions against the Arabs.
   The hostages include six Americans and 10 Europeans. The longest
held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Earlier, a source close to the Syrian army command said that if
any hostage were released, it would probably be Brian Keenan, a
Belfast man who was traveling on an Irish passport when abducted.
   The Irish Red Cross flew the first Western relief plane into
Tehran after the June 21 earthquake in northern Iran that killed
about 40,000 people.
   Shortly before the quake, three Irish parliamentarians visited
Tehran and held talks about Keenan with Iranian Foreign Ministry
officials.
   On their return to Dublin, the parliamentarians condemned the
imprisonment of more than 300 Lebanese Shiites in the Khiam jail in
Israel's self-designated ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.
   Release of these prisoners has been a major demand by the
kidnappers of Western hostages in Lebanon.

   The dollar was down in European trading this
morning while the British pound showed new strength.
   Gold prices were lower.
   The British pound moved above $1.80 on the strength of a
statement this weekend by John Major, the chancellor of the
exchequer, that the British currency could be allowed to rise above
3.0000 Deutsche marks preparation for entry to the exchange rate
mechanism of the European Monetary System.
   The British pound was quoted at $1.8097, down from $1.8115 at
the opening but up strongly from late Friday's $1.7865.
   The pound had not been above $1.8000 since Jan. 4, 1989.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 150.70 yen, down 0.25 yen from
Friday's close. The yen-dollar rate was unchanged in late-morning
trading in London.
   Dealers said the dollar was stronger in early trading in Tokyo
because U.S. employment data released on Friday was better than
expected.
   ``But it moved lower, with many traders expecting U.S. interest
rates to ease, after it was reported that U.S. Treasury
Undersecretary (David) Mulford has welcomed the yen's recent
recovery,'' said Kohei Kuroda of Sumitomo Bank.
   Other dollar rates compared with Friday:
   _1.6470 German marks, down from 1.6540
   _1.3922 Swiss francs, down from 1.4005
   _5.5270 French francs, down from 5.5515

   _1.1585 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1630
   The dollar rate for the Dutch guilder was not available.
   London's gold dealers fixed a recommended price of $359.90 per
troy ounce this morning, down from $361.25 late Friday.
   Gold in Zurich was quoted at $360.20, down from $361.25 late
Friday.
   Gold in Hong Kong closed at $360.62 per troy ounce, up 14 cents

<HEAD>Two Lutheran Congregations Show Support Of Gay Ministers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of two Lutheran congregations sang
hymns and prayed to show their support of three homosexual
ministers whose ordination led to an unprecedented church trial.
   A disciplinary committee of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America, expected to complete a three-day hearing today, could
expel the local churches for defying denomination rules by
ordaining a lesbian couple and gay man. The panel has until July 17
to issue its decision.
   At Sunday services, the Rev. John Frykman, pastor of First
United Lutheran Church, told his congregation that tolerance was
the Lord's way. Members of St. Francis Lutheran Church heard and
expressed a similar message.
   ``Jesus accepted everyone, and we should accept everyone,'' said
Erna Dennert outside St. Francis.
   The church, with 5.3 million members, is the largest Lutheran
body in the United States. Like other mainstream churches, it
forbids the ordination of sexually active homosexuals, arguing that
sex should be practiced only within marriage.
   Despite the ban, the two local churches in January ordained
three seminary graduates who were open about their homosexuality
and refused to take a vow a celibacy.
   Jeff Johnson, 28, was named assistant pastor of United Lutheran,
a predominantly heterosexual congregation of about 100 in the
city's Richmond district. Ruth Frost, 42, and Phyllis Zillhart, 32,
a couple together for five years, are at St. Francis, a largely gay
congregation in the Castro district.
   ``We have many gay and lesbian pastors in the church right now,
and there is no reason they should stay in the closet,'' Zillhart
said Sunday.
   But Sierra Pacific Synod Bishop Lyle Miller, who heads the
church in Northern California, filed charges against the two local
congregation and their pastors.
   ``We are not convinced ... that living in homosexual
relationships is what ought to be,'' Miller said Sunday.
   The ecclesiastical hearing, which began Friday, marks the first
time the church has sought to discipline a pastor or congregation
since it was formed in a merger of three major Lutheran groups in
January 1988.
   The 14-member committee could censure First United and St.
Francis, suspend or expel them.
   But Frykman and the Rev. James DeLange, pastor of St. Francis,
say they and their congregations are willing to be ousted to prove
their support of the civil and religious rights of gay people.
   All 13 other ELCA churches in San Francisco have said they
support the two defiant congregations and will maintain relations
with them even if they are expelled, Frykman said.

<HEAD>Innocent Plea Entered In Slaying Of Seven Arab Workers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 21-year-old Israeli charged with the
premeditated murder of seven Palestinian laborers in a burst of
automatic rifle fire refused to speak as his trial opened today.
   Judge Chaim Steinberg ruled that Ami Popper's silence amounted
to a plea of innocent to charges he gunned down the seven Arabs and
wounded 10 others on May 20 outside Tel Aviv.
   The massacre led to widespread riots in the occupied Gaza Strip
and West Bank, and 13 other Palestinians were killed by army
gunfire in the three days after the mass slaying as soldiers tried
to put down the violence.
   Before the plea was accepted, Popper's lawyer, David Ofek, asked
to be relieved of the job of defense attorney. He cited in part the
young man's refusal to communicate.
   Steinberg rejected Okek's request and set the next court session
for September 5. Ofek later said he would appeal the Tel Aviv
District Court judge's decision to the Supreme Court.
   Popper, dressed in a white T-shirt and black shorts, remained
silent throughout the one-hour opening session.
   The victims of the massacre were among about 50 unarmed Arab
workers waiting for day labor jobs in the Tel Aviv suburb of Rishon
Letzion.
   The charges say Popper was armed with a Galil assault rifle and
forced the workers to sit in rows, then stopped a passing vehicle
and ordered its occupants to join the others.
   ``All of a sudden, the accused aimed his weapon in the direction
of the workers and started firing incessantly,'' the charges say.
   Popper, who is from Rishon Letzion, was arrested shortly after
the slayings.
   At the time, authorities described Popper as ``deranged'' and
distraught over an unhappy love affair.
   Ofek later maintained Popper was trying to kill one man among
the 50 laborers. He said the intended victim was one of five Arabs
who sexually assaulted Popper when he was 12.
   Popper's family first said they had never heard of such an
assault, but later said the suspect began to act strangely at the
time of the alleged molestation.
   Ofek had argued that Popper was unfit to stand trial, but a
panel of five psychiatrists found he was able to understand the
charges.
   In court today, Popper spent most of his time staring at the
ceiling during the proceedings before a three-judge panel
consisting of Steinberg, David Ben-Ofir and Edmond Levy.
   Ofek, who was appointed by the court, said he could not defend
Popper because of the youth's silence and because he was unable to
find a psychiatrist willing to perform the further examination of
his client he feels is needed.
   In rejecting Ofek's request to be removed from the case,
Steinberg promised the court's aid in finding a psychiatrist
willing to examine Popper.

<TEXT>
   The 1979 Rolls Royce Zsa Zsa Gabor was driving
when she had her infamous cop-slapping confrontation with a Beverly
Hills policeman was auctioned for $90,000.
   Miss Gabor, 72, sat in the Corniche convertible and patted the
door affectionately as auctioneers drove up the price at an auto
sale Sunday.
   ``I don't like giving it up,'' Miss Gabor said after the
auctioneer announced that Leo Dutran of Boston was the high bidder.
   The actress was convicted of slapping the policeman during a
July 14 traffic stop in Beverly Hills. She was sentenced to serve
72 hours in jail after failing to complete community service work
as ordered.
   Dutran collects cars of celebrities for a museum in a Boston
suburb.
   Auctioneer Mitchell Kruse of Kruse International, Auburn, Ind.,
said 500 cars were sold during the two-day event at Bally's Hotel
and Casino.
   Another celebrity car sold Sunday was a 1957 Ford with a
retractable roof, owned by actor Larry Hagman. It was purchased by
Richard Crane of Dallas for $37,500.
   Hagman said he bought the car five years ago and kept it in
storage.
   ``I've got nine cars and my wife told me I had to sell one of
them,'' Hagman said.

   Israeli jets rocketed guerrilla bases of
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia today in their second raid in 22
hours on south Lebanon bases of the Shiite Moslem fundamentalist
fighters.
   One Hezbollah fighter was killed and 11 people _ five combatants
and six civilians _ were wounded in the raid, said a police
spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules.
   In two runs spaced over 10 minutes, four F-4 fighter-bombers
rocked the bases in the villages of Loweizeh and Melita _ which are
two miles north of Sunday's targets.
   It was Israel's third raid on targets in Lebanon in four days
and 15th this year. Police said leaping flames and palls of black
smoke hung over the targets in Iqlim al-Tuffah, or the apple
region, southeast of the port city of Sidon.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli military said the targets, 15 miles
north of the border, were bases for ``organizing and launching
attacks'' against Israel.
   It said all its planes had returned safely, but gave no other
details.
   Both Loweizeh and Melita are traditional strongholds of
Hezbollah, or Party of God, and overlook the northern flank of
Israel's self-declared security zone.
   Hezbollah confirmed the new strikes in a statement issued in
Beirut and said they were followed by massive artillery bombardment
of the two villages from Israeli positions in the security zone.
   After Sunday's raid, Hezbollah fighters fired three
surface-to-surface missiles toward northern Israel.
   Early today, Israeli artillery hammered suspected guerrilla
hideouts in the foothills of Mount Hermon.
   Military helicopters illuminated the rugged mountain slopes with
parachute flares as long-range guns on the Israeli border pounded
the villages of Ein Atta and Kfeir in southeastern Lebanon before
dawn, police said.
   In Sunday's raid, Israeli warplanes destroyed a Hezbollah
snipers' nest and ammunition depot on a hilltop between the
villages of Jarjou and Ein Bouswar.
   Police said at least three people were killed and 12 wounded in
Sunday's raid. That raised the overall toll of Israeli air strikes
this year to 19 dead and 51 injured, excluding today's raid.
   The raids followed word from Iran's official news agency
Saturday that one of the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon, probably a
European, might soon be freed. Hezbollah is the umbrella group for
factions believed holding most of the hostages.
   ``Let us pray the Israeli attacks will not scuttle efforts to
free one of the hostages,'' said a Shiite source close to
Hezbollah's Iranian-backed leadership.
   ``The hostage-holders are definitely restless, but I personally
believe Iran's pressure will probably override the impact of the
attacks,'' the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Shiite fundamentalists accuse Western governments of bias toward
Israel and hold them responsible for its actions against the Arabs.
   Jarjou and Ein Bouswar are two to three miles north of Israel's
security zone. Hezbollah has long been engaged in guerrilla attacks
on Israeli troops and allied Lebanese Christian militiamen policing
the zone.
   The zone's population is predominantly Shiite Moslem. Israel
carved out the buffer area in 1985, saying it was needed to guard
against cross-border raids.
   Israeli jets on Friday attacked bases of radical Palestinian
guerrillas in Syrian-policed northern and eastern Lebanon. Eight
fighters were wounded.

<HEAD>Former Prague Communist Boss Sentenced To Four Years In Prison</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prague's former Communist Party
boss was found guilty today of abuse of power and sentenced to four
years in jail in the first conviction of a member of the country's
former hard-line leadership.
   The official, Miroslav Stepan, had ordered use of water cannon
and tear gas against demonstrators in Prague in the fall of 1988. A
year later, a popular uprising toppled the authoritarian Communist
government.
   Dozens of Czechoslovak citizens crowded in front of the small
room where the district court verdict was handed down, and some
expressed satisfaction.
   ``That serves him right _ that's exactly what he deserved,'' an
elderly woman said.
   Under Czechoslovak law, sentencing comes at the time of
conviction.
   Stepan appealed the verdict but was to remain in custody. No
date was set for the appeal, which was to be heard by a municipal
court.
   The court ruled he had ``unjustifiably'' overstepped the bounds
of his office when, as chairman of the Prague Defense Council, he
ordered the action against the demonstrators on Oct. 28, 1988.
   He was also accused of having demonstrators transported outside
Prague in January 1989 after they failed to disperse as ordered by
police.
   Stepan, 44, was arrested on Dec. 23, 1989, less than a month
after stepping down as Prague party boss. He was the first member
of the country's Communist leadership to be brought to trial.
   The trial, which began June 25, was initially held behind closed
doors but was opened to the public four days later after strong
complaints in the Czechoslovak media.
   Stepan had pleaded innocent and said it was a political trial.
He appealed to President Vaclav Havel to hold no more such trials.
   Five other former high-ranking officials, including Communist
Party leader Milos Jakes and chief ideologue Vasil Bilak, were
detained last month and accused of ``serious criminal activity.''
But all were released within 48 hours.
   Stepan, who joined the party's ruling Politburo in December
1987, had a reputation as a ruthless hard-liner. He was
instrumental in suppressing a wave of street protests in Prague
beginning in August 1988.
   The Communists ruled Czechoslovakia for four decades until they
were toppled by a peaceful revolution in November.
   Czechoslovakia's new non-Communist-controlled government took
over in December.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Urges Aid from West as Economic Summit Opens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said today
that Western aid to the Soviet Union would benefit his country and
the donor nations.
   Leaders of the world's seven richest countries convened in
Houston today with the question of aid to Moscow at the top of
their agenda.
   Shevardnadze, asked by reporters at a Communist Party Congress
in the Kremlin whether he thought the Soviet Union needed Western
aid, said: ``I feel it would be advantageous, for us and the West.''
   But he said he disliked the term ``aid,'' preferring ``credit,
technical cooperation, personnel training, joint ventures and joint
projects.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is worried his country cannot
make the painful leap to a market system without Western credits
and wants help from the industrial powers to stop the Soviet
Union's economic decline.
   Gorbachev recently sent President Bush a communique that is
believed to repeat an appeal for aid he made in a letter to British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Western opponents of aid to the Soviet Union say that no help
should be given until the Kremlin drops its economic and military
support to Cuba and withdraws from the Kurile Islands north of
Japan.
   Asked whether the Soviet Union would cut aid to Cuba,
Shevardnadze said that was strictly ``a question of bilateral
relations,'' and did not indicate the government's plans.
   Soviet troops occupied the Japanese islands in the last days of
World War II and have refused to leave.
   The leaders of West Germany and France advocate helping the
Soviet Union despite disagreements over Cuba and Japan, and have
called for aid worth $15 billion to bolster reform plans.
   The credits also would help Soviet businesses meet payments due
to Western firms. The Soviet Union traditionally has been punctual
in making such payments and recent delays have eroded confidence
among foreign investors.
   West Germany already has granted an unconditional loan of $3.1
billion, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl is apparently growing impatient
with opposition from other industrial powers to the aid plan.
   Moscow's balance-of-payment deficit now tops $2 billion, nearly
half of it owed to West German companies. Part of the West German
credit is expected to be used to pay overdue bills.
   Bush has balked at a massive aid program until Soviet
authorities move more decisely from a planned to a market economy.
   The Soviet Union could use Western cash, but there are questions
over how much is needed and what impact it would have.
   Inability to keep food stores stocked has already forced Moscow
to spend an extra 3 billion roubles _ $500 million _ on food
imports.
   Even more aid is believed necessary if the Soviet Union is going
to leap to a market economy.
   Without an infusion of Western cash, the move to the market
could cause greater hardship for the population and put more social
pressure on Gorbachev.
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told the Supreme Soviet
parliament in late May that the consumer market was ``destitute.''
   Ryzhkov, presenting a plan for what he called a ``regulated
market economy,'' warned that if trends continued, ``many crucial
decisions, unpopular as they are, will meet an even more embittered
response.''
   The Soviet economy suffers from inflation and a huge budget
deficit. In the first four months of this year, ethnic unrest and
strikes caused the loss of an estimated 10 million man-hours.
   Pro-market reforms are likely to cause a further drop in
production as unprofitable businesses go bankrupt.
   Figures on how much money would begin to stabilize the economy
range from $5 to $20 billion _ colossal compared to what Eastern
European countries received to restructure their economies, but
modest given the size of the Soviet economy and its relatively low
level of foreign debt.

   A man just paroled from state prison
apparently murdered a teen-age boy and then died in a fiery head-on
collision as he attempted to take the body somewhere to dispose of
it, authorities said.
   The investigation of a highway accident in southeastern Kansas
on Sunday turned into a murder probe when an autopsy showed one of
the four people thought to have died in the wreck already was dead
of a stab wound before the accident.
   ``It's a strange, fantastic case,'' said Dr. William Eckert, the
veteran pathologist who autopsied all four bodies. ``I've never had
one like it. This guy was already dead in the car and the man was
going to stick him somewhere.''
   Names hadn't been released this morning pending positive
identifications and notification of relatives. But authorities
believe they included a 16-year-old Wichita boy who was dead before
the accident happened and a 34-year-old parolee.
   Wichita police said the parolee was released Tuesday from a
state prison in Norton where he had been serving a 10-year term for
kidnapping and sodomy.
   A statement from Chatauqua County Sheriff Butch Lewis said a car
driven by the parolee struck a pickup truck Sunday morning on U.S.
166 southeast of Sedan in far southeastern Kansas. Both vehicles
burned and the four bodies were burned beyond recognition.
   Meanwhile, 125 miles away, the parolee's mother returned to
Wichita from a trip Sunday morning and found blood inside and
outside her home, according to a police report. She told police her
son had been staying with her.
   Investigators theorize the parolee was driving to Oklahoma to
dispose of the body. He reportedly borrowed the car involved in the
accident from a friend in Derby early Saturday evening.
   The missing Wichita 16-year-old was last heard from Saturday
evening when he went cruising in downtown Wichita in a pickup
borrowed from his uncle, police said. That truck was found
abandoned at a convenience store.
   An autopsy showed the boy died of a stab wound in the heart,
authorities said.

   A 14-year-old boy who officials say grew
tired of hunting and decided to start shooting at passing cars was
arrested in the death of a taxi driver.
   The boy, whose name was not released because of his age, was
jailed without bond Sunday on charges of first-degree murder and
attempted murder. Police say he was among three youngsters who were
hunting in the area.
   Raymond Montanino, 53, of Melbourne was fatally shot by gunfire
that also hit two other cars late Saturday afternoon.
   ``The three subjects had been hunting in the area and decided to
start shooting at passing motorists,'' said detective Emmanuel
Jenkins. ``I guess they were just kids with nothing better to do on
a Saturday afternoon.''
   Occupants of the other two cars escaped injury, but Montanino
was hit in the right chest by a bullet that passed through an open
passenger window. He was later pronounced dead at Holms Regional
Medical Center in Melbourne.
   The others youths, age 14 and 15, were questioned by police and
released, although they still could face charges, Jenkins said.

<TEXT>
   When homeless activist Mitch Snyder was near
death several times during hunger strikes for the homeless, he and
co-worker Carol Fennelly talked about his possible death and
planned his funeral, she says.
   But Ms. Fennelly said she never expected to be planning her
longtime companion's memorial this way _ after Snyder hanged
himself in his room at the shelter they both fought the Reagan
administration to create and maintain.
   Snyder, who fought for the homeless for 17 years, apparently was
making no political statements last week when he hanged himself by
an electrical cord. Police found a note near his body describing
problems in his 15-year relationship with Fennelly.
   Nonetheless, she said his funeral Tuesday will be a reminder of
his sacrifices to unite and secure cooperation for his cause and
the Community for Creative Non-Violence, which he founded.
   ``Everything Mitch did was political, where he lived, what he
did, where he ate,'' Ms. Fennelly said in a telephone interview.
``That is who Mitch is. He wanted his funeral to be not just an
event for the sake of the event, he wanted it to have some
political impact, and we intend to make it so.''
   The mourners are expected to include the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
Washington Mayor Marion Barry, actor Martin Sheen and
entertainer-nutritionist Dick Gregory.
   Snyder did most of his work in the streets and that is where his
funeral will be held.
   After a service by Jackson in front of the homeless shelter
where Snyder lived, a horse-drawn cortege will carry his body to a
rally at city hall before his body is cremated.
   Ms. Fennelly declined to speculate on what Snyder's death might
mean to the causes he espoused.
   ``All I know is that Mitch is dead and I'm trying to put
together a funeral that would make him happy,'' she said. ``And
that is all I care about.''
   ``He was a very good teacher. He taught us many good things and
skills we need to have to carry on,'' Ms. Fennelly said.
   She was briefly hospitalized late Saturday after fainting during
a CCNV strategy meeting.
   ``I'm feeling a little better,'' she said Sunday. ``It's a
moment by moment thing.''

<TEXT>
   A worldwide coalition of environmental groups is
hoping to spotlight what it claims is a big-talk, little-action
record of the major industial nations meeting today at the economic
summit.
   The ``Envirosummit'' group of 150 organizations says the world's
seven wealthiest countries have done little since ending their 1989
meeting with a proclamation that ``decisive action is urgently
needed to understand and protect the earth's ecological balance.''
   President Bush and his six summit guests have the global
environment on their agenda Tuesday and are expected to come up
with a 1990 communique outlining how the seven nations will
cooperate on international controls.
   But U.S. officials said in advance the summit was unlikely to
produce any bold moves on environmental protection.
   The ``Envirosummit'' group ranks West Germany highest on
performance during the past year, with a 65 score out of a possible
100.
   It tallied the score by examining policies on climate change,
protection of biological diversity, preserving tropical forests,
combatting pollution of the oceans, population control policy, aid
for the cleanup of Eastern Europe, and aid to Third World countries
to preserve the environment during economic development.
   France was second, 48 out of 100, and the United States, Japan,
Britain, Italy and Canada were clustered close with scores ranging
from 39 to 42.5.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu scoffed at the
environmental survey results.
   ``I think most of that grading was on environmental rhetoric
rather than on environmental performance,'' he said during an
appearance today on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``I think West Germany got a lot of good grades for rhetoric,''
Sununu added. ``If you take a good look at what the United States
has actually done in terms of cleaning up our environment, reducing
emissions into the atmosphere, cleaning up the quality of our water
and now, with the added benefit that will come from the clean air
bill that the president put forward, i don't think the United
States has to take a back seat to anyone in terms of reality of
performance on the environment.''
   Although most countries agreed earlier this year to end
production of chemicals that destroy the earth's protective ozone
layer by the year 2000, George T. Frampton, president of The
Wilderness Society, said: ``The reality is that our forests are
being cut just as fast as they were a year ago. Carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gases are being emitted into the atmosphere at
just the same high volume, or even greater, than that of a year
ago. Population growth and ocean pollution have continued
unabated.''
   Jay Hair, executive vice president of the National Wildlife
Federation, told a news conference Sunday that ``the most shining
achievement of the past year'' was West Germany's announcement that
it would try to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the most
important ``greenhouse gas'' responsible for what many scientists
believe is a gradual warming of the globe, by 25 percent. No other
country has made such a commitment.
   Calling the scores ``generous by any standard,'' Conrad von
Moltke, a German environmentalist on the staff of the World
Wildlife Fund said, ``It's hard to see how Germany is going to
maintain this kind of ranking, devoted as it is to ever-bigger
cars, ever-faster cars on ever more roads.''
   ``This is not a one-shot deal,'' Frampton said. Members of the
coalition will refine their scorecard to make it what Frampton
called a better ``objective template'' for measuring national
policies, and mobilize pressure against the governments concerned.
   The group said one item of environmental news out of the summit
had no effect on the national rankings. That was the announcement
by President Bush and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney that Canada and
the United States would negotiate an air pollution agreement, with
preliminary talks this month.
   Bush said a year ago that he expected to proceed along those
lines once revisions to the Clean Air Act to enact new controls on
the sources of acid rain were nailed down. Both the House and
Senate versions of the bill include requirements for large
reductions in acid rain precursors, and the White House is
optimistic Bush will get a bill from the House-Senate conference
committee that he can sign.
   Half the acid rain falling in eastern Canada originates in
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from power plant
smokestacks and other sources in the United States, and Mulroney
and his predecessor, Pierre Trudeau, sought a U.S. control program
in vain for more than a decade.
   ``I think this day will be long remembered in the history of our
relationship for the significant departure it constitutes from past
positions,'' Mulroney said in his joint appearance with Bush.

   Miners said today they were going ahead with a
one-day protest strike this week despite an appeal for labor peace
from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Communist
leaders.
   ``We no longer consider the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
our party,'' said Vasily Grinev, a member of the strike committee
in the country's second largest coal field, the Kuznetsk Basin in
the Western Ukraine.
   Miners in the largest coal region, the Don River Basin of the
Ukraine, met for 12 hours Sunday and resolved to go ahead with the
strike on Wednesday.
   Workers at the Zhiguli Automotive Works in Togliatti plan to
hold a sympathy meeting during their lunch break, but will not stop
production, said Ivan A. Baryshnykov, a workers' spokesman.
   The miners are angry over shortages of housing, food and other
consumer goods, and concerned that Gorbachev's reforms will raise
prices without giving them any benefits.
   The 28th congress of the Soviet Communist Party last week urged
miners not to strike. Gorbachev repeated that appeal in a televised
interview Sunday night, warning workers not to take what he called
``an illegal path.''
   ``Everybody should understand that this is not the time for
ultimatums,'' Gorbachev said in a Soviet television interview taped
in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses, where the party congress is
meeting.
   After a nationwide coal strike last summer, the government
passed new rules requiring workers to complete a complicated
procedure before they can legally strike. But miners in Vorkuta
have been striking periodically over the past year.
   Despite the appeals, feelings of anger and independence were
growing among miners in the Donbass, Western Siberia and Vorkuta in
the Arctic. They plan to send only skeleton shifts into the shafts
Wednesday morning and stage demonstrations.
   The protests are designed to warn party leaders that they can no
longer assume the support of the working class they claim to
represent.
   Asked whether the strike was a sign of flagging ties between the
party and workers, Gorbachev acknowledged that ``the party is
guilty before the working class, because (the workers') role is
weak now.''
   At a preliminary conference last month, miners from around the
nation scheduled a congress to found the union and called for a
mass exodus of party workers and the nationalization of party
assets.
   Although the party relinquished its constitutionally guaranteed
monopoly of power last winter, no nationwide political group has
emerged to challenge it. But a free nationwide miners' union could
do just that.
   The party congress opened last Monday with a demand from Donbass
miner Vladimir Bludov for the resignation of the Communist Party
leadership.
   The miners, who work in shafts owned by the Ministry of the Coal
Mining Industry, struck last July to demand that the government
increase supplies of meat, soap, laundry detergent and other
consumer goods.
   They also wanted safer working conditions in the mines, where
about 600 people are killed by accidents yearly, and they wanted
the ministry to surrender control of the coal fields to local
authorities.
   Faced with the worst Soviet strike in 72 years, the Council of
Ministers capitulated. But the miners say the government has not
kept its promises.

<HEAD>Police Suspect Serial Killer in Couple Slayings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police in eastern Virginia believe the
slayings of six young people and the disappearance of two others in
recent years may be the work of a serial killer.
   The unsolved cases involve four couples traveling by car in
isolated areas. One crime has occurred annually between April and
October since 1986. None has occurred this year, but police fear
the killer may strike again by October.
   Police ``have been working jointly together for some years now
and they have come to some possible conclusions,'' said Cpl. Bob
Haynes, spokesman for a joint FBI-Virginia State Police task force
investigating the crimes with local police.
   The killer may have dressed as an authority figure, such as a
police officer, to win the victims' cooperation and lure them to
their deaths, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star, the combined Sunday
paper, quoted an unidentified source as saying the killer could be
someone disguised as a police officer. When asked whether the
killer might be an officer, the source said, ``we cannot rule that
out.''
   Police plan to announce give detail on their findings at a news
conference later this month, Haynes said.
   ``They're pretty much convinced it's a serial killer,'' said
Mark Johnson, a College of William and Mary police detective.
Johnson investigated the first crime, the 1986 slayings one of the
college's students and her friend.
   ``They felt it was all connected,'' said Margie Lauer, whose
son, Daniel, was one of the slaying victims. Mrs. Lauer said FBI
and state police agents recently told her of the serial killer
theory.
   ``We were expecting something like this,'' Kathy Knobling,
stepmother of another slaying victim, said Sunday. She is a
spokeswoman for a group of the victims' relatives and friends.
   Irvin B. Wells III, special agent in charge of the FBI's Norfolk
office, said the randomness of the crimes and certain similarities
lend credence to the serial killer theory.
   But he also noted the crimes lack a definite ``signature''
because different types of weapons were used.
   Here are details of the four cases:
   _In October 1986, Rebecca A. Dowski, 21, a William and Mary
student from Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and Cathleen M. Thomas, 27, a
Virginia Beach stockbroker, were found strangled and stabbed in
Miss Thomas's car along a scenic drive that connects historic sites
at Jamestown and Yorktown.
   _In September 1987, Robin M. Edwards, 14, of Newport News and
David L. Knobling, 20, of Hampton were found shot to death on their
first date at Ragged Island Wildlife Refuge in Isle of Wight County.
   _In April 1988, Keith Call, 20, and Cassandra Hailey, 19, two
Christopher Newport College students, disappeared on their first
date. Call's pickup truck was found abandoned on the Colonial
Parkway. The two have not been found.
   _In September 1989, Lauer, 21, and Annamaria Phelps, 18, both of
Amelia County, disappeared on their way to Virginia Beach. Lauer's
car was found at a rest stop in New Kent County. Their bodies were
discovered in woods nearby six weeks later. Miss Phelps died of a
knife wound but the cause of Lauer's death was not determined.

   Czechoslovak diplomats said the first of
the more than 5,000 Albanians who took refuge in a dozen foreign
embassies in Tirana would leave their Communist homeland tonight
for Prague.
   The announcement by the Foreign Ministry in Prague followed
accusations by Albanian officials that foreign diplomats in the
Albanian capital were deliberately slowing the emigration process
to cause instability.
   In the Czechoslovak capital, Deputy Foreign Minister Vojtech
Wagner said 51 refugees would arrive in Prague this evening from
Tirana aboard an aircraft normally used by President Vaclav Havel,
the state news agency CTK reported.
   The Czechoslovak diplomat said only one or two asylum-seekers
wanted to remain in Czechoslovakia and the rest wanted to go to the
United States or Australia. Other missions said that although the
Albanians would travel through their countries, they did not yet
know where they would settle.
   The French Foreign Ministry in Paris said the formalities of
obtaining passports for the 550 refugees at its embassy in Tirana
were moving along rapidly, and ``we hope they will be finished by
the end of the day.''
   The asylum-seekers, some dodging police bullets, began taking
refuge on June 28. Albanian authorities pledged Saturday that they
would receive travel papers and be accompanied out by diplomatic
personnel.
   But referring to the decree that guaranteed the asylum-seekers
would not be punished, the Albanian state ATA news agency on Sunday
accused diplomats of not moving quickly enough to seek documents
for the refugees.
   ``This is a stand with premeditation and certain aims to
artificially create tensions and problems,'' the statement said.
``It also arouses embarrassment and indignation in the public
opinion.''
   In Bonn, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said today that any of the
3,000 Albanians crowding his country's embassy in Tirana who wish
to travel to West Germany will be allowed to do so.
   But the official would not say whether the Albanians would be
allowed to settle in West Germany. He said that ``so far no one has
manifested a desire to come here. They just want to leave Albania.''
   A spokesman at the Foreign ministry in Budapest, Gyoergy Lukacs,
said six of the 40 Albanians at the Tirana embassy expressed a
desire to settle in Hungary. Most others wanted to go to the United
States, he said.
   Diplomats trying to arrange exit for the Albanians have accused
the government of disrupting efforts to feed and provide medical
care for the refugees, many of whom were injured scrambling into
embassy compounds.
   The West German, Italian and French embassies were among those
reporting difficulties taking care of the refugees.
   A Hungarian diplomat said the embassies were told they had to
arrange transportation for any Albanians they accepted.
   Police sealed off Tirana's embassy row on Sunday to prevent more
Albanians from joining those who had taken refuge inside foreign
missions.
   There were no reports of unrest on Sunday. On Saturday,
thousands gathered near embassy row for silent rallies against
Europe's last remaining hard-line Communist rulers in Albania, a
country of 3.2 million on the Adriatic Sea.
   The turmoil appeared to contribute to a shake-up Saturday of the
ruling Politburo and government. One Politburo member was
dismissed, three officials were retired and the police minister and
minister of war were fired.
   Some foreign missions lack sufficient food and water for the
refugees and sanitary conditions were poor, officials said Sunday.
They said Albanian authorities were not allowing foreign
governments to send supplies.
   ``The situation in our embassy, but in other embassies as well,
has become intolerable,'' West Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher told West German television.
   The French Foreign Ministry described the situation at its
embassy as increasingly difficult, with inadequate sanitary
facilities and a lack of medicine for the more than 500 refugees.
   A French doctor was seeing 60 patients a day, many of whom were
injured while scaling the compound's fence, said the ministry.
   In Rome, Italian Sen. Franco Salvi said after returning from a
private visit to Tirana that 900 Albanian asylum-seekers wanted to
come to his country.
   The Italian ambassador's wife was forced to buy food at the
local market to feed those in the mission, Salvi said. Two
prefabricated huts were hastily erected on embassy grounds to house
some of the Albanians.
   Communist leader Ramiz Alia has begun this year to institute
some cautious economic reforms in an attempt to alleviate shortages
and raise the standard of living by creating incentives for workers
and farmers.
   For 45 years, travel for average Albanians has been virtually
impossible. But Albanian leaders have sought better ties abroad
since 1985, and they recently began to implement reforms.
   A package of new regulations that took effect Tuesday entitled
all Albanians over age 16 to own a passport.

<TEXT>
   Americans' views of the Soviet Union and leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev are positive, but they strongly oppose
providing them with financial assistance, according to a newspaper
poll published today.
   Financial aid to the Soviets is one of the major issues to be
discussed at the International Economic Summit that officially
began today, but Americans apparently have already made up their
minds.
   The Houston Chronicle's copyright poll showed that 58 percent of
the respondents oppose direct economic assistance to the Soviet
Union, while 24 percent support it and 16 percent are unsure.
   Seventy-nine percent favored more open trading, 69 percent
supported providing the Soviets with technical assistance and 50
percent were for favorable credit terms.
   The national survey, taken June 25 through July 2, was conducted
through telephone interviews with 773 U.S. residents 18 or older.
It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
   The environment was named by poll respondents more than any
other issue as the probable greatest threat to the United States in
the next century. It was named by 30 percent of those interviewed.
   ``We're worrying less and less about the Soviet military threat
and more and more about issues that have for years been on the back
burner'' such as the environment and international terrorism, said
Richard Murray, the University of Houston political science
professor who conducted the survey for the Chronicle.
   The poll also shows that 64 percent believe that Japan is the
country that poses the greatest long-term economic threat to the
United States. Forty percent believe the U.S. trade deficit results
from unfair trade practices by the Japanese.

<HEAD>Inquest Faulted Christian Science Officials In Child's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian Science officials contributed to the
death of Robyn Twitchell by discouraging his parents from calling a
doctor, an inquest concluded three years ago.
   David and Ginger Twitchell, lifelong Christian Scientists, were
convicted Wednesday of manslaughter in the April 1986 death of
2{-year-old Robyn, by relying solely on prayer to treat the boy
during a five-day illness.
   They were sentenced to 10 years' probation on Friday and ordered
to take their three remaining children for regular medical exams.
   In a 1987 report, West Roxbury District Court Judge Lawrence D.
Shubow found that the church's chief spokesman, Nathan Talbot; a
Christian Science nurse; and a church practitioner ``contributed''
to Robyn's death by acting ``recklessly and without legal excuse.''
   The three were never indicted by the grand jury investigating
the case.
   Shubow's 35-page report was impounded since its completion in
1987 but was released Friday by Superior Court Judge Sandra Hamlin,
who presided at the Twitchells' manslaughter trial.
   Talbot was faulted for telling the Twitchells to call a funeral
home rather than the police or the medical examiner when the couple
called Talbot to say Robyn had died. Talbot said today that the
church no longer told followers to call a funeral home in such
circumstances.
   An autopsy showed the boy suffered from a congenital defect that
had caused a bowel obstruction.
   Calling police or the medical examiner ``would have in normal
course initiated a lifesaving response,'' Shubow wrote. ``The
delays in reporting Robyn's plight erased his remaining chance to
survive.''
   Linda Blaisdell, a church nurse recommended to the couple by
Talbot, had earlier ``wrongfully prescribed food for Robyn which
probably worsened'' his illness, Shubow wrote.
   Nancy Calkins, a Christian Science practitioner, apparently
discouraged the parents ``from seeking to follow any alternative
medically oriented choice,'' Shubow wrote.
   Talbot said this morning that the church had a longstanding
policy of telling Christian Scientists to call a funeral home
instead of calling police, but that has changed since the Twitchell
case.
   ``There has never been criticism of Christian Scientists
handling it this way,'' Talbot said. The policy has changed in part
because funeral homes themselves now direct people to call 911,
Talbot said.
   Calkins said today that she did not want to discuss the matter.
But her attorney, Peter Samek, disputed the report of the inquest.
   ``That's false and I don't think that is the finding of the
inquest,'' Samek said. ``She has no ability to render anything
besides Christian Science spiritual treatment.''
   Blaisdell refused to comment on the report.
   Shubow concluded the Twitchells should be prosecuted for
manslaughter and that the church officials might be prosecuted as
accessories to manslaughter.
   Suffolk District Attorney Newman A. Flanagan called for the
inquest to determine the circumstances surrounding the boy's death.
Shubow's findings were adopted by prosecutors and presented to a
grand jury in 1988, but only the Twitchells were indicted.

   Hooligans attacked police and foreigners and
looted stores in both German states during raucous, violent
celebrations marking West Germany's World Cup victory, police said
today.
   More than 100 people were hurt and four people were killed
during countless melees across the nations.
   Hundreds of thousands of Germans poured into the streets in
scores of cities to savor the emotional victory Sunday night, but
roving bands of rowdies and neo-Nazi skinheads used the
celebrations for violent rampages.
   The violence lasted into this morning, and widespread vandalism
and looting were reported in numerous cities.
   In the West German city of Hamburg, about 400 hooligans armed
with rock and bottles clashed with police. Fifty-four police
officers were injured and 88 people were arrested, authoritie said.
   Windows of more than 20 stores were smashed, one bar was
destroyed and several police and private autos were damaged by the
mob, police said.
   Police used truncheons and water cannons to break up the crowd.
   West Germany's 1-0 victory over Argentina in the World Cup
soccer final had strong political overtones for the nation, which
is about to unite with East Germany.
   East Germans also took part in the celebrations and the violence.
   In East Berlin, neo-Nazi skinheads rampaged on the city's main
square and smashed the windows of a bar frequented by homosexuals
and attacked passers-by. Three people were seriously injured,
authorities said.
   The skinheads reportedly chased Vietnamese living and working in
the country.
   Twelve people were arrested, police said.
   Despite the violence, many soccer fans who poured into the
streets were elated over the victory, and they proclaimed that it
was the year of the Germans.
   According to some Germans, there were many reasons to celebrate:
   _ Unification is just around the corner and is likely to be
completed before Christmas.
   _ West Germany pumped billions of marks into East Germany for
this month's currency union, and the mighty mark remained just as
strong as ever.
   _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl is playing an increasingly important
role in guiding European affairs and world events.
   _ German language instruction is on the increase in the United
States.
   _ German sports officials recently announced they will soon have
a single Olympic team after years of separation.
   _ Berlin is a top contender for summer Olympic games in the year
2000.
   ``Deutschland, Super Deutschland,'' thousands of fans from East
Berlin and West Berlin shouted.
   Thousands of flags waved in the cool night air amid the victory
celebrations in a massive outpouring of pride that rivaled the wild
scenes after the Berlin Wall fell last November.
   With nearly 80 million people and a powerhouse economy, the
reunified nation to be formed later this year will be the dominant
force in Europe.
   East Germans, despite predictions of massive problems during a
transition to a capitalist economy, have already embarked on what
is likely to be the second Economic Miracle. It could become almost
as dramatic as the first one that brought prosperity to postwar
West Germany.
   ``After eight years of uninterrupted expansion, the West German
economy does not give any sign of running out of steam,'' said the
respected French newspaper Le Monde.
   All this comes at a time when Germans are working less and
enjoying life more. One powerful labor union in May won a landmark
contract that provides for phasing in a 35-hour work week.

   Nearly half of the Arco Chemical Co.
plant employees were returning to work today but the plant remained
out of operation as investigators tried to determine what caused an
explosion that killed 17 workers last week.
   About 150 of the plant's 350 workers were told to return to
work, said Gerald Davis, Arco Chemical spokesman.
   ``We'll just bring some administrators in,'' Davis said. ``Other
employees will be out until a judgment is made about the safety at
the plant and we will continue to pay their salaries and try to
keep them informed about what's happening in the plant.''
   The sprawling plant complex will be brought back into operation
in phases that could span several months, Davis said.
   Company officials and representatives from the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration toured the crumbled remains of a
block-long area of the 564-acre chemical plant on Sunday.
   Seventeen workers from Arco and contractors Austin Industrial
Inc. and Waste Processers Industries Inc. were killed Thursday
night when a wastewater tank exploded in a fireball. Investigators
have been unable to determine the cause of the blast.
   The widow of a millwright killed Thursday said her husband
called her a half hour before the plant blew up, saying workers
restarting equipment there were afraid it might explode.
   Lori Davis said her husband, Michael Davis, said they were
afraid to restart a compressor that they had fixed.
   ``They thought it might blow,'' Mrs. Davis said.
   Harold Sorgenti, president and chief executive officer of Arco
Chemical, earlier said workers were repairing an electric
compressor near a 900,000-gallon wastewater treatment tank when the
explosion occurred.
   The tank separates hydrocarbons from water and then a compressor
pumps the sometimes volatile vapors into a pipeline where
impurities can be removed before releasing the gases to the
atmosphere, officials said.

   Starzl, 64, was admitted Sunday afternoon to the hospital's
cardiac unit, where the surgeon underwent tests on his heart
function, said hospital spokesman Frank Raczkiewicz.
   Starzl had a heart catheterization, said hospital spokeswoman

vessels to the heart to withdraw blood samples or measure pressures
in veins, arteries and the heart's main chambers.
   Starzl, who has no history of heart problems, was alert and
resting, Raczkiewicz said.
   Starzl helped create one of the world's leading transplant

<HEAD>Sandinista Supporters Barricade Streets to Support Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Nicaraguans armed with
clubs and machetes built street barricades with paving stones early
today in support of a week-old strike against the government's
economic policies.
   A warning was broadcast every half-hour on state Radio
Nicaragua, saying police would act harshly against those causing
disorder, but there were no signs of intervention by security
forces.
   Some of Managua's main streets were blocked, bringing the
capital to a virtual standstill.
   In the low-income eastern neighborhoods, protesters passed
paving stones from hand to hand to build barricades and burned huge
bonfires of old tires. A cloud of malodorous smoke hung low over
Managua at dawn.
   Associated Press reporters touring trouble spots overnight were
unable to return to their homes.
   ``Everyone must return to work today and those who do not will
be fired,'' President Violetta Barrios de Chamorro warned in the
radio broadcasts.
   The scene was reminiscent of Managua 11 years ago when the
former Sandinista government built similar barricades at the height
of their revolution against former dictator Gen. Anastasio Somoza.
   It was in the eastern neighborhoods that some of the most
intense fighting took place during the 1979 revolution and where
Sandinista support is still the strongest. The Sandinistas remain
the largest political grouping in Nicaragua.
   Strike leaders say 80,000 workers are taking part in the
walkouts called in part to protest massive firings by the Chamorro
government. Workers also want a greater voice in setting economic
policy.
   Unions threatened to interrupt electrical service and
international flights if the government did not agree to their
demands by today.
   The strikes are directed against government offices, public
transportation, telephone and mail services and state-run
agriculture, construction and textile businesses.
   Talks to end the walkouts collapsed Friday and the government
declared them illegal. The government has said the strikes are
politically motivated.
   Hope that ran high when Mrs. Chamorro took office 10 weeks ago
has faded as Nicaraguans realized the econmomic crisis and bitter
political divisions would not disappear quickly.
   The government has said tough measures are needed to rescue the
crumbling economy, including cuts in government subsidies, higher
utility rates, privatizing state enterprises and the return of land
confiscated under the Sandinistas.
   A similar strike by Nicaragua's top-heavy public sector brought
the country to a standstill in May. Strikers won major concessions,
including pay raises of 100 percent.
   Nicaragua's economy has been battered by almost a decade of war
between the former Sandinistas and the now disbanded U.S.-backed
Contra rebels. At least 50,000 people died in that conflict.
   Mrs. Chamorro defeated Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega in the
Feb. 25 elections. She is trying to reverse his party's centralized
government policy and replace it with free-market strategy.

   Admirers of George Mason say he gets no
respect, despite serving alongside Thomas Jefferson, George
Washington and James Madison as architects of the Constitution.
   Unlike his fellow Virginians, Mason never became president, and
no national monument was ever raised to his memory.
   Mason fans are working to redress what they say is a nearly
200-year-old wrong by erecting a memorial to him, perhaps fittingly
in the shadow of the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C.
   It seems Mason's refusal to sign the Constitution he helped
create vexed his contemporaries enough that he was nearly written
out of the history books.
   ``George Mason has been the forgotten patriot all along,'' said
Donald R. Taylor, director of Gunston Hall, Mason's meticulously
restored plantation on the Potomac River, near Washington's Mount
Vernon home.
   ``It seems that although Mason played a very central role in
creating what resulted in our federal form of government, he has
gotten bad press because he refused to sign the completed
document,'' Taylor said.
   Mason's main beef with the Constitution? It contained no bill of
rights. Mason believed a rib of the new nation's government must be
protection for its citizens should that government turn hostile,
Taylor said.
   He also raised a few hackles in a losing battle to ban further
imports of slaves. ``He really was ahead of his time in many
respects,'' Taylor said.
   An anti-federalist, Mason tangled frequently with Madison and
Jefferson over the key issue of local control versus centralized
power. On most points, Mason lost. In the end he was one of only
three delegates to the 1787 constitutional convention who refused
to sign.
   Mason died in 1792, one year after the Bill of Rights was added
to the Constitution. The 10 amendments closely resemble a bill of
rights for Virginia that Mason drafted in 1776.
   Taylor would like to install the modest sculpture honoring Mason
next year, the bicentennial of the Bill of Rights.
   The site selected by Taylor's group is a somewhat remote plot
near the Tidal Basin. A bed of flowers and small stone fountain now
occupy it.
   State Sen. Joseph V. Gartlan Jr. prodded the legislature to
contribute $100,000 to build the memorial. Another $150,000 is
being raised by the Gunston Hall Board of Regents.
   A Virginia sculptor's blueprints call for a pair of 15-foot
bronze pyramids mounted inside the fountain. Quotes from Mason and
a carving of him would surround the pool.
   ``It is low-key, but very symbolic,'' Taylor said. One pyramid
would have 16 striations, representing the 16 articles of the
Virginia Declaration of Rights. The other would have 10 for the 10
amendments in the Bill of Rights, he said.
   A previous effort to honor Mason did little to rescue him from
obscurity. In the 1950s, a span of the 14th Street Bridge over the
Potomac was renamed for Mason.
   An unofficial survey of Virginia commuters who use the bridge
daily shows the nomenclature is almost universally ignored.
   ``It's named for who?'' asked one woman.
   Taylor has heard this before. ``There are plenty of people in
Virginia and elsewhere who have never heard of him,'' Taylor said.
That's despite the growing presence of George Mason University, a
state university in Fairfax County.
   The memorial project has cleared most official hurdles, although
Congress still must approve the plan. Sen. Charles S. Robb, D-Va.,
is leading that effort, which has attracted no opposition.
   If Congress misses next year's date, the installation could be
keyed to the 200th anniversary of Mason's death in 1992, Taylor
said.

northern fleet squadron commander, told reporters.
   The destroyer's visit follows last year's visit by the British

   Paul Laurent, a senior official of the French
Communist Party, has died of cancer, the party announced. He was 65.
   Laurent, who died Sunday, was secretary of the party's Central
Committee, a member of its Political Bureau and a close ally of
party leader Georges Marchais. He also was one of three Communists
on the Paris City Council.
   Last year, he led the Communists in negotiations with the
governing Socialists to coordinate leftist candidacies in municipal
elections.
   Born May 1, 1925, Laurent joined the Communist Party at age 20.
He led the party's youth movement from 1954 to 1962, and joined the
Central Committee along with Marchais in 1956.
   He was considered a relative liberal within the party and was
credited with expanding members' freedom of expression.
   The party did not announce funeral arrangements and gave no

   An Iranian newspaper criticized an
earthquake expert Monday for predicting that a strong temblor will
rock the Iranian capital, and said such reports only create panic.
   The newspaper, Abrar, lamented that ``this rumor is being spread
at a time when people are still deeply saddened by the recent
earthquake in Gilan and Zanjan provinces.'' The report was quoted
by the official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus.
   More than 40,000 people died in the June 21 earthquake in
northeastern Iran, centered about 125 miles from the capital.
   In an interview with another newspaper, Kayhan, the head of the
seismological institute at Tehran University said there was a
strong possibility of an earthquake in Tehran.
   The official, Bahram Akkasheh, did not say when the earthquake
might strike.
   Tehran is in a seismologically active area, and the official's
prediction was in line with what other experts have said both
inside and outside Iran.
   Abrar said the news media should inform the people, not create
anxiety and panic among them, IRNA reported.

   Anti-government violence fueled by an
aborted pro-democracy rally spread across the nation today and
police used gunfire and tear gas in clashes with protesters. Two
people were reported killed.
   The death brought to at least five the number of people reported
killed since the disturbances began Saturday when police used
gunfire and tear gas to stop thousands from rallying.
   Protesters tried to rally after the government detained at least
12 pro-democracy activists last week. The U.S. Embassy confirmed
today that it had given asylum to one activist who went into hiding.
   The government made its first comment on the rioting in a
statement that condemned the United State's decision to give refuge
to Kuria and U.S. suggestions that Kenya consider political
pluralism.
   ``The government of Kenya wishes to protest in the strongest
terms against this unwarranted interference in Kenya's
international affaris by the embassy of a friendly country,'' the
statement said.
   ``The choice of what kind of political system Kenyans want ...
cannot be forced upon the people of this country by anybody and
neither can it be brought by the kind of violence, hooliganism and
lawlessness which was witnessed in certain parts of Nairobi last
weekend,'' it said.
   A spokesman said the U.S. Embassy had no immediate comment on
the protest.
   Today marked the first time the violence spread outside Nairobi.
Clashes between demonstrators and police were reported in Nakuru,
Muranga and Nyeri, all north of the capital.
   In Ndenderu, about 10 miles north of Nairobi, police opened fire
on demonstrators and shot dead an elementary school student,
according to a Daily Nation newspaper photographer who witnessed
the incident.
   The other death occurred in one of more than half a dozen
low-income neighborhoods ringing the capital, where stone-throwing
mobs clashed with police. Police confirmed the death but would not
give details.
   Riot police used clubs and gunfire to break up gangs and clear
open-air markets where rioters burned a bus and used boulders and
burning tires to build roadblocks.
   Security forces and bands of demonstrators also clashed on
Sunday.
   President Daniel arap Moi left today for Ethiopia to attend the
annual Organization of African Unity summit.
   
   He repeatedly has rejected any move toward a multiparty system,
saying the existence of about 40 tribes in Kenya would invite
tribal-based parties, leading to ethnic divisions and even tribal
warfare.
   The government has reacted angrily to U.S. suggestions that it
consider allowing competing political parties. At one point, the
government threatened to curtail the movements of the U.S.
ambassador, Smith Hempstone.
   Hempstone was the target of a bitter attack on Sunday in the
Kenya Times, the ruling party's newspaper. In an editorial titled
``Shut Up, Mr. Ambassador,'' it threatened his expulsion.
   Hempstone called the editorial ``an outrageous piece of work.''
   Nairobi was tense today. Shops closed and businesses shut down
as people fled the city to escape further violence. Thousands left
on foot because public transportation appeared to have stopped.
   The English-language Daily Nation newspaper said three people
were killed in Sunday's disturbances.
   Ten people, five with gunshot wounds, were hospitalized in
serious condition, and dozens of others had been wounded since the
violence began Saturday, the newspaper said.
   Hospitals provided no official casualty figures.
   Shots were heard near the U.S. Embassy in downtown Nairobi.
   However, the gunfire did not appear directed at the American
mission, which has given temporary asylum to Gibson Kamau Kuria, a
prominent human rights lawyer under threat of arrest for his
criticism of Kenya's one-party rule.
   Kuria, a former detainee who in 1988 won the Robert F. Kennedy
human rights award, sought refuge at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi
early Saturday, according to a statement released by the embassy
today.
   ``He came on his own and asked for temporary refuge,'' the
statement said. ``He expressed a desire to leave the country. We
are discussing this matter with the government of Kenya.''
   Kuria, 43, went into hiding Thursday following a wave of arrests
in which Kenya's most prominent proponents of multiparty democracy
were seized.
   The United States is a major donor to Kenya, whose economy is
heavily dependent on foreign aid. Last year the U.S. gave $61
million in economic aid and $15 million in military assistance,
according to a study prepared by The Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank in Washington.

<HEAD>Titanic Inquiry after 78 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inquiry will be held into the conduct of a
steamship captain who was criticized for not coming to the aid of
the Titanic when it sank 78 years ago, the government said Monday.
   The Titanic sank after striking an iceberg in the North Atlantic
on April 14, 1912. More than 1,500 of the 2,200 people aboard the
ship perished.
   The Marine Accident Investigation Branch will examine testimony
at the 1912 inquiry into the loss of the great liner to throw light
on the role of the late Capt. Stanley Lord, said a Department of
Transport spokeswoman.
   The inquiry comes in response to a campaign by Lord's relatives,
who have been trying to clear his name, said the spokeswoman. She
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The inquiry was first reported in Monday's editions of The Daily
Telegraph, which said a crucial piece of evidence would be the
position of the wreck as determined in 1985 by U.S. oceanographer
Robert Ballard.
   Lord was master of the Boston-bound Californian, believed to
have been the ship nearest to the Titanic when it struck the
iceberg.
   The Carpathia and other ships which were farther away than the
Californian did reach the scene in answer to the stricken liner's
distress calls.
   Lord's ship was stopped by ice at the time. The original inquiry
censured him for not responding to distress rockets from the
Titanic and ruled that as he was 8 to 10 miles from the liner he
could have gone to its aid and saved lives.
   Lord died in 1962, claiming to the end that the Titanic was in
an icefield 20 miles or more from his ship and that he was unable
to help. A campaign to clear his name has been carried on by his
son and other supporters, and an earlier petition to reopen the
inquiry was rejected in 1965.
   Lord insisted that a ship seen from the Californian was not the
Titanic. The ship was only identified in 1962 as the Samson, a
seal-hunter.
   ``Supporters of Capt. Lord claimed he was a scapegoat for the
failire of the Titanic's owners and the Board of Trade to make sure
there were enough lifeboats,'' The Daily Telegraph said.
   It quoted Capt. James de Coverley, deputy chief of marine
accidents, as saying the 1912 inquiry would not be reopened as that
had been into the Titanic's loss, not Lord's conduct.
   ``We are not in the business of rewriting history but in this
particular case it was considered desirable to have a
re-evaluation,'' de Coverley was quoted as saying.

   The Soviet Union on Monday took its first concrete
step toward negotiating the independence of Lithuania by naming a
team of top representatives for the talks.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev appointed Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov to head the 22-member Soviet team, according to the
official Tass news agency.
   The delegation was ordered to negotiate with the Baltic republic
in connection with its 100-day moratorium on a March 11 declaration
of independence. The freeze takes effect only at the start of
negotiaions.
   Ceslovas Jursenas, a spokesman for Prime Minister Kazimiera
Prunskiene, said he thought preliminary talks could start within 10
days.
   Most of the Soviet officials named to the delegation are
currently involved in the 28th Soviet Communist Party Congress,
scheduled to end this week.
   The Lithuanian parliament will vote as soon as Tuesday on its
team, from a list of nominees put forward by its Presidium, said
another aide to Mrs. Prunskiene.
   The high-powered Soviet team includes First Deputy Minister Yuri
Maslyukov, head of the central planning agency Gosplan; Interior
Minister Vadim Bakatin; army chief of staff Mikhail Moiseyev; and
deputy KGB chief Filipp Bobkov, Tass reported.
   The Soviet delegation also includes top officials dealing with
aviation, nationalities, communications and finance _ an indication
of how complicated a process it will be to unravel relations
between Lithuania and the Soviet Union.
   On June 29, Lithuania decided on the 100-day moratorium on its
declaration of independence in return for an immediate end to an
economic blockade and the start of negotiations on its demands.
   Moscow had cut off almost all oil, most natural gas and numerous
other items on April 18 to try to force Lithuania to rescind its
declaration.
   Lithuania, an independent republic between the two world wars,
was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940 along with
the other two Baltic republics, Latvia and Estonia.
   The Lithuanian government is preparing documents asking Moscow
to suspend its mandatory military draft of Lithuanian youth,
Jursenas said.
   It also wants Moscow to pledge that it will not interfere with
efforts to establish direct economic contacts with other Soviet
republics.

   Scattered rain and cooler temperatures
helped slow the spread of wildfires that have charred more than
550,000 acres of timber, but 2,100 firefighters remained on the job.
   No lives or homes have been lost to the more than 200 fires
across the state, most sparked by lightning strikes. There have
been no reports of arson, authorities said.
   Firefighters from all over the United States were attacking the
43 worst fires, aided by 34 helicopters and 11 air tankers dropping
fire retardant.
   The cooling trend allowed firefighters to get close enough to
flames to begin taking the offensive, said Bureau of Land
Management spokesman Rob McWhorter.
   By early today, more than 550,000 acres of forest and tundra had
been consumed by wildfires, an increase of more than 200,000 acres
from Saturday, when 23 new fires were started after 2,600 recorded
lightning strikes, officials said.
   ``There's so many fires and Alaska's so big, there's still a day
and a half to two-day lag in mapping fires and coming up with
acreages,'' said Frank Carroll, with the Fire Information Center in
Fairbanks. ``Alaska makes Texas look like a very small place.''
   The Tok fire remained a top priority, because it still was
considered a potential threat to people and buildings if winds
changed and hot summer temperatures returned.
   The Tok airport reopened to civilian air traffic Sunday as the
fire that swept near the town moved toward the village of Tetlin,
20 miles away, McWhorter said.
   The village of 60 residents wasn't immediately threatened by the
blaze, but firefighters were monitoring winds to see which way
flames would blow, he said.
   Crews using bulldozers nearly finished digging a fire line
around Tok, a southeastern Alaska town of 1,200 residents located
at the junction of the Alaska and Glenn highways that have been
closed off and on since last week.
   Thirty smokejumpers on Sunday parachuted near a fire threatening
cabins on the Yukon River about 15 miles from the crossing of the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline.
   Cabins were threatened by the 3,000-acre Cassiar Creek Fire
about 50 miles from Fairbanks. The Beaver fire, named after a
village within 10 miles of the flames, was estimated to have
charred almost 200,000 acres by today, Carroll said.

<HEAD>Some Census Workers Lose Unemployment Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many of the temporary workers taking the
nation's census may be ineligible for unemployment compensation
when their jobs end because of a recent money-saving change in the
law.
   The actual number of people affected is hard to estimate because
rules for unemployment compensation eligibility vary from state to
state. Neither congressional or census spokesmen would estimate the
number affected.
   In the past, temporary census jobs have counted toward
eligibility for unemployment compensation just as any other job.
   However, this year an appropriations bill signed by President
Bush on May 25 set an April 20 cutoff on census workers getting
credit toward unemployment. Temporary census work done after that
date doesn't count when they are eventually laid off and apply for
unemployment benefits.
   How that cutoff affects individual workers depends on the
unemployment eligibility rules in their states. Some states, for
example, require 26 weeks of work before someone becomes eligible.
People who haven't accumulated that before April 20 would not be
able to collect benefits.
   April 20 was the deadline for people sending in their mailed
census forms, meaning the credit cutoff applies primarily to the
thousands of temporary field workers who were sent door-to-door to
track down people who did not apply. Much of that work has now been
finished, although follow-up operations are expected to continue at
least through fall in some areas.
   Warren Kane of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which
inserted the provision into a financial bill, said the action made
$70 million available for completing the national head count.
   The low response rate to the mailed portion of the census meant
more staff had to be hired to go door to door, and the committee
had to find money to cover that hiring.
   In looking at census finances, he said, the committee found that
when the bureau hired temporary workers it was setting money aside
to cover their later unemployment costs when the jobs ended. By
cutting off unemployment credit at April 20 the committee
eliminated the need for those funds, which then became available
for hiring more temporary workers, Kane said.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev won a critical
behind-the-scenes struggle today for a new Communist Party
Politburo that is expected to champion his reforms and push for a
looser federation of the Soviet republics.
   The party congress voted to require the Politburo to consist of
the general secretary, his deputy and the first secretaries of the
parties of the 15 republics.
   The change guarantees that the small group of primarily Russian
men who traditionally ruled the Soviet Union would be replaced by
largely pro-reform, non-Russian Communists.
   Most of the republic party leaders want the political
sovereignty, market economy and looser union of states advocated by
Gorbachev.
   The change also allows Gorbachev to bypass the 250-member
Central Committee, expected to be heavily conservative when the
congress elects it later this week.
   The congress is expected to elect Gorbachev to continue as
general secretary, despite vitriolic criticism of his political and
economic reforms from delegates at the largely conservative party
congress.
   Some delegates said he may be allowed to virtually hand-pick his
deputy, although the congress officially elects the person when it
meets once in five years.
   A weary-looking Gorbachev took the floor of the 28th party
congress this afternoon after hammering his proposal through four
hours of ``heated'' discussions in committee.
   After making his announcement, Gorbachev sat down next to the
temporary chairman of the party congress, parliamentary chairman
Anatoly Lukyanov, and urged quietly, ``Let's vote.''
   The key vote on changing the Politburo membership to include the
republic leaders was 3,325 to 839.
   Gorbachev told delegates that others could be added to the
Politburo by the Central Committee from among its members. But the
final rules did not mention this.
   The new rule could completely change the Politburo membership
because none of the 15 republic party chiefs are now members of the
12-man body.
   Seven of the 12 men on the current Politburo already have said
they will resign or have hinted of the possibility.
   Any decentralization, and particularly the looser union of
sovereign republics now under discussion, would give the republics
more power over their own affairs.
   Most republic leaders also believe their areas will fare far
better under a market economy than under continued central
planning, which they blame for sucking dry their republics'
resources and giving little in return.
   Gorbachev said the new structure would allow the 15 republic
parties ``to act independently, and to really influence the Central
Committee and Politburo.''
   The current 12-man Politburo has only two non-Russian members:
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, from the republic of Georgia,
and Ukrainian President Vladimir Ivashko. There is but one
non-Russian, Latvian Boris Pugo, among the seven non-voting members
of the Politburo.
   The congress was expected to take nominations for general
secretary later in the day.
   On Sunday, Gorbachev who has been the party general secretary
since 1985, faced tough questioning at a meeting of workers and
farmers attending the congress as non-voting observers.
   Many Soviets blame the Communists for the economic crisis and
decades of institutional corruption, and the party's candidates
have suffered defeat after defeat at the polls.
   Coal miners announced plans to stage a one-day nationwide strike
Wednesday to warn party leaders they can no longer take for granted
the support of the working class they claim to represent.
   The meeting of workers, farmers and Gorbachev was closed to
foreign reporters, and Soviet media carried no details.
   Many of Gorbachev's remarks were conveyed by Nina Zhukova, a
weaver from the Russian city of Ivanovo. She said she sat near
Gorbachev at the meeting. Her account was confirmed by other
participants interviewed on Red Square.
   Sergei Sotnikov, a party official from Yaroslavl, said the
atmosphere was ``tense'' and included complaints about the lack of
consumer goods in stores.
   ``They criticize me personally or the Politburo, (and debate
whether) to remove us or not,'' Gorbachev reportedly said during
the four-hour session.
   ``I will listen to it all but you will decide everything. Am I
needed by you? You will decide,'' he said.
   Gorbachev sometimes reacts angrily to criticism, and at least
four times in the past two years he has offered to resign.
   He told the workers and farmers that the matter was in the hands
of the congress.
   ``I maintain only one thing: The policy that I have chosen I
will pursue, and for me the biggest prize is that my homeland will
live,'' he said, according to Zhukova. She said Gorbachev urged the
audience to support him.

   A key witness against Marion Barry
acknowledged today that she used drugs just a month ago and said
she has distributed them 300 times to about 10 people in addition
to the mayor.
   The FBI hasn't asked for the names of her other customers, Lydia
Pearson told the jury in Barry's cocaine and perjury trial.
   ``The only one'' of her alleged customers the FBI asked her
about ``was Marion Barry?'' asked the mayor's lawyer, R. Kenneth
Mundy.
   Yes, replied Pearson.
   She said the other customers to whom she has sold drugs numbered
about 10.
   ``How many times'' did she distribute drugs, Mundy asked her,
``300 times, 400 times?''
   ``I will say three (hundred),'' she replied.
   Pearson said she last used drugs June 8. She also used drugs in
February days before appearing before a federal grand jury to
testify in the Barry case.
   She acknowledged that she has been granted limited immunity from
prosecution. None of her statements in the Barry case can be used
against her.
   She testified she supplied him with crack about 25 times in a
three-month span. Three bags of crack at $30 a bag was his usual
purchase, she added.
   She described crack deliveries to Barry at two hotels and a
government office building, and provided approximate dates for the
alleged deliveries.
   Mundy had exploited the inability of former model Rasheeda
Moore, an earlier witness, to recall dates of her alleged drug use
with Barry over several years.
   Convicted cocaine dealer Charles Lewis had testified that he and
the mayor used cocaine repeatedly at the Ramada Inn in December
1988. They conspired to cover up their drug use from investigators
by agreeing to testify falsely to a grand jury, Lewis said.
   Moore testified that she and Barry used cocaine, marijuana and
opium over 100 times from 1986 to 1989.
   She persuaded Barry to come to her hotel room in the Jan. 18 FBI
sting where the mayor was videotaped smoking crack.
   Barry's lawyers say the mayor was the victim of entrapment and
that his accusers are lying to avoid prison. Lewis was released
from jail shortly before his testimony.
   Barry, his lawyers suggest, is merely another in a long series
of black leaders targeted by the FBI.
   Barry, the city's mayor for nearly 12 years, pleaded innocent to
10 counts of cocaine possession, one count of conspiracy and three
felony charges of lying to a federal grand jury.

   Criminals holding a 273-year-old Stradivarius violin
stolen three years ago are seeking $2.5 million in ransom, an
Italian newspaper reported Monday.
   The instrument, once owned by the last czar of Russia, Nicholas
II, is believed held by an organized crime gang in Turin, according
to the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera.
   The instrument was stolen from French musician Pierre Annoyal in
April 1987 when he was in Turin to teach a course at the European
Academy of Music, the newspaper said.
   It was reportedly in the trunk of his car, which was stolen when
he went into a shop to buy a pack of cigarettes.
   Police in Turin declined to discuss the case. The newspaper said
a photo of the violin was recently delivered to the police by an
individual known to have contacts with organized crime groups.
   Corriere della Sera said the ransom demand was made to the
owner. It did not say how it got the information.
   It did not give a value for the violin but decribed it as
``priceless.''

   Gov. Buddy Roemer said today he was cool
to way the Legislature's hastily passed anti-abortion bill was
drafted but also called it a step ``in the correct direction.''
   After failing to override the governor's veto of a stronger
anti-abortion bill, the Legislature passed a measure Sunday that
would ban most abortions and punish doctors who perform them with
up to 10 years at hard labor.
   The law includes provisions demanded by Roemer to exempt victims
of rape and incest, but he said today he wouldn't take action on it
until he had read all the fine print.
   The bill approved Sunday night bans all abortions except those
to end pregnancies that endanger a woman's life and those caused by
rape or incest that is reported promptly. Despite being weaker than
the bill Roemer vetoed last week, it still would be the strictest
state abortion law in the nation.
   At a news conference today, Roemer said he was ``pleased that
there was some movement in the correct direction'' but also was
``disappointed that it was a last-minute move.''
   ``Not well done _ that was my feeling,'' he said.
   Roemer gave no timetable for acting; he has 20 days to take
action.
   ``We'll have to read it first,'' Roemer said. ``It happened late
last night. ... We have an obligation constitutionally to look at
the bill and see if it does what they say it does.''
   If he signs it or does nothing, it goes into effect 60 days
after the end of the legislative session, which is today. If he
vetoes it, the only way the legislature could revive it would be by
calling itself into special session and staging yet another
override vote.
   On Sunday, Sen. John Saunders, mastermind of the revised
legislation, urged fellow legislators to ``vote for the 15,000
unborn children who are murdered in this state every year, for the
200,000 murdered in the nation. The nation is watching us.''
   The measure is intended to challenge Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 U.S.
Supreme Court decision recognizing the right to an abortion.
   Roemer had vetoed the Legislature's original bill Friday because
it made no exceptions for victims of rape or incest.
   The bill was created by amending a flag-burning measure the
Senate had refused to consider, then eliminating the flag-burning
provisions, which would have reduced the penalty for beating up a
flag burner to a $25 fine. The offense currently is punishable by
six months in jail and a $500 fine.
   The maneuver, completed 30 hours before the legislative session
ends at midnight tonight, enabled the Senate to circumvent the
usual process of referring new legislation to a committee.
   ``I would have preferred a stronger bill, but we don't have the
votes for an override,'' Saunders told his colleagues.
   The Senate vote on the bill was 32-7. Less than an hour later,
the House approved the measure 83-22.
   The House had voted late last week to override the governor's
veto of the earlier bill. The Senate on Saturday voted 23-16 to
override, three votes short of the needed two-thirds majority.
   Both abortion-rights activists and staunch abortion foes
criticized the new bill.
   ``We've just seen the Legislature go from the most restrictive
abortion bill in the nation to the most absurd,'' said Planned
Parenthood spokeswoman Terri Bartlett. ``The only thing that
surpasses it is the mockery of the legislative process. Only in
Louisiana could you have a flag-burning bill become an abortion
bill.''
   Rep. Woody Jenkins, the original bill's author, voted against
the new version because ``the unborn is a human being from the
moment of conception and we ought not make exceptions to the
principle.''
   The bill carries a penalty of one to 10 years in prison and
$10,000 to $100,000 in fines for doctors who perform abortions. It
would not penalize women who get abortions.
   The ``hard labor'' provision of the sentence means that the
inmate, if medically able, would be required to perform physical
work rather than clerical or cleanup duties. Louisiana's state
penitentiary is a farm operation that requires field work.
   In the House, Rep. C.R. Jones urged colleagues to reject the
bill, pleading with them to resist the intense lobbying by
fundamentalist Christian groups and Roman Catholics.
   ``I'm concerned that religious groups have taken over in
Louisiana, the South, maybe this nation,'' Jones said.
   Pennsylvania has the strictest state abortion law, but it is
less restrictive than the Louisiana bill.
   The Pennslyvania measure, approved in November, bans abortions
based on the fetus' sex and bans abortions after the 24th week of
pregnancy except to save the life of the mother or prevent
``substantial and irreversible harm.''
   A doctor convicted under the sex-selection ban or the 24-week
provision could be punished with up to seven years in prison and a
$15,000 fine.
   Portions of the law have been put on hold by a state appeals
court.
   An even stricter abortion bill was passed in the U.S. territory
of Guam. But it has been blocked for now by court challenges.
   That law prohibits any abortion except to save the life of the
pregnant woman and makes it a felony to perform an abortion and a
misdemeanor to have one.

<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When former schoolteacher Kenneth Kaunda
led the British colony of Northern Rhodesia to independence as
Zambia 26 years ago, he was the head of one of Africa's richest and
most stable nations.
   World prices for copper _ which accounts for 90 percent of
Zambia's export income _ were riding high. Kaunda warmed in the
glow of popular support and was hailed as the father of Zambia. The
colonial rulers left him with $400 million in credit.
   Today, Zambia is one of the world's poorest nations. It has a $7
billion foreign debt and most of the country's 7.5 million
inhabitants want the 66-year-old president to step down.
   ``Kaunda out, Tembo in,'' was the cry in Lusaka, the capital,
and other parts of the country during last month's riots, six days
of Zambia's bloodiest urban violence since independence in 1964.
   The imprisoned Lt.-Gen. Christon Tembo, 46, Kaunda's former army
commander, has been hailed as Zambia's man of the hour.
   Summoned home from his job as ambassador to West Germany in
October 1988, Tembo was arrested with three other officers for
allegedly plotting a coup. He has been jailed ever since.
   His trial began last year and he has pleaded innocent to a
capital charge of treason.
   The rioting and looting June 25-30 was fueled by state-ordered
increases of 120 percent in the price of cornmeal, the nation's
staple food known locally as mealie meal.
   At least 26 civilians were killed by police and army bullets,
hundreds were wounded and more than 1,500 were arrested, mainly for
violating a dusk-to-dawn curfew.
   Some victims were gunned down June 30 as they rejoiced near
Kaunda's official residence over a state radio broadcast that the
army had seized power in an overnight rebellion.
   The announcer was Signals Corps Lt. Mwamba Luchembe, 38, son of
a Bemba tribal chief. He and three fellow officers plotted to
overthrow Kaunda while the president was visiting the central
province of Ndola.
   Luchembe and his comrades were arrested by loyalist troops at
the Radio Zambia building. They face a treason trial and possible
death if convicted.
   In the last urban unrest in December 1986 _ also over food price
increases _15 people were killed by security forces. But anger then
was directed at the army, not Kaunda.
   This time, in a dozen cities and towns, protesters demanded
Kaunda's resignation, a return to old prices and a restoration of
multiparty democracy, which was abolished with the imposition of a
one-party state in 1972.
   Kaunda was defiant.
   ``All they can do is kill me,'' he said after he learned of the
failed coup attempt. ``I will not bow to thuggery.''
   Still, police guard was reinforced at State House, the curfew
was extended and Kaunda cut down public appearances.
   ``We've had enough,'' said Lucas, a youth from Lusaka's Chilenje
township, who clutched rocks in both hands at the height of the
anti-government riots. ``It's time for him to go.''
   Like most Zambians interviewed, Lucas spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Dorothy Mubanga, a primary school teacher, is a typical Zambian
who suffered from the government decision to lift subsidies on
cornmeal and more than double its price.
   The move was part of a package of economic austerity proposals
made by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and Western
nations, Zambia's main creditors. At least two-fifths of export
income is sapped by debt repayments.
   Mubanga earns about $32.50 a month, from which she has to buy at
least two bags of mealie meal, which now costs $13.45.
   On top of other food purchases such as sugar, meat, tea, bread,
and vegetables, she must pay rent for her small suburban house and
bus fares to work and back, leaving her without a cent to spare.
   Her two brothers _ like most unemployed Zambians _ try to make
ends meet by selling smuggled goods from Botswana and South Africa
on Lusaka's black market.
   Even well-off Zambians expressed sympathy for the rioters and
dismay with the president.
   However, Kaunda has refused to make any significant concessions.
Instead, he promised to crack down on ``coup plotters'' and
``thugs.'' Some 5,000 students from the University of Zambia, who
led the week of violence, have been sent home.
   But Kaunda did seize on the troubles to announce a national
referendum on whether to revive political pluralism.
   The ruling United National Independence Party grudgingly agreed
to put the issue to a vote in March, but only after Kaunda declared
he feared democracy would plunge the country into tribal conflicts.
   If the referendum is free and fair, Zambians are expected to
snub their head of state and opt for the multiparty system used by
the British colonists prior to independence, observers say.

<HEAD>Majority Of French No Longer Drink Wine, Survey Shows</HEAD>

   For the first time, most French people say they
never drink wine, according to a study published Monday by a wine
industry organization.
   The number of people who drink wine every day also dropped
sharply, from 32.5 percent in 1980 to 18.5 percent this year, the
study showed.
   The nationwide survey of 4,000 people was conducted in March and
April by the National Interprofessional Office of Wine, which
represents various associations of winemakers and sellers.
   Participants were asked about the drinking habits of all adults
in their household, and the responses reflected the practices of
12,400 people, the organization said. No margin of error was given.
   In a 1980 survey conducted by the group, 38.7 percent of the
respondents said they never drink wine. That percentage climbed to
45.1 in 1985 and to 50.7 this year.
   Wine consumption varies sharply by sex, according to the survey.
It said 10.9 percent of the women and 28.1 percent of the men
identified themselves as daily wine drinkers.
   Asked why they didn't drink wine, 73.4 percent of the
respondents said they didn't like it and 25.3 percent cited health
concerns.
   The beverage most commonly chosen to replace wine at the dinner
table was water, the study found.

   A year ago, the idea would have been unthinkable.
Now it is the most compelling question to confront these leaders of
the Western world: Should they dig into their deep pockets to help
the Soviet Union and Mikhail S. Gorbachev?
   The risk of saying no could be the failure of perestroika _ the
ambitious restructuring of the Soviet system _ and Gorbachev's
downfall. But saying yes has its perils, too, since it would mean
pouring billions into an economic morass that has resisted five
years of Gorbachev reforms.
   But ``Where would we be if he were chucked out?'' Brian
Mulroney, the Canadian prime minister, wondered aloud on Sunday as
he and leaders of the six other richest nations gathered for their
annual economic summit. Still, Mulroney himself isn't ready to
provide direct help just now.
   Even more skeptical is President Bush, who received Gorbachev's
plea for help in his role as summit host. The President questions
the wisdom of assisting the Kremlin while it provides $5 billion a
year to Marxist Cuba, spends about one-quarter of its budget on the
military and has put few free-market procedures into play.
   At a very minimum, the seven leaders are expected to send a team
of experts to the Soviet Union to assess its economic problems. If
the summit produces nothing more for Gorbachev than that, it would
hardly amount to a ringing endorsement.
   Gorbachev knows he has problems. They are everywhere. And he
wants help.
   As the summit opened today, the issue was completely up in the
air. There was no decisive majority for or against helping
Gorbachev to overcome an ossified economic system that makes the
Soviet Union an unpopular trade partner and faint source of relief
to deprived and depressed consumers.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, with a strong assist from
French President Francois Mitterrand, wants to put together a $15
billion aid package for Gorbachev. They are the strongest advocates
of direct assistance.
   Bush has ``big problems'' with the concept, he said at the NATO
summit meeting last week in London. So does Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu of Japan. He reiterated last Friday it would ``not be
possible'' for Japan to participate in economic assistance to
Moscow until the Soviets resolved a 45-year territorial dispute
over four islands in the Kuril peninsula.
   The split is fundamental. According to a well-placed U.S.
official it is so deep the seven governments have not even decided
whether to deal with aid to Moscow in their summit-ending
declarations later his week.
   Decisions on virtually all the other items on the summit agenda
await only the leaders' pro forma approval. They have been worked
over by experts since the last summit in Paris. But aiding the
Soviet Union is the vexing exception.
   It isn't the first time in the 16 years of economic summits that
a solution to a tough issue had to be hammered out in hard
bargaining at the summit itself.
   In 1983, the last time the United States played host, President
Reagan held out at Williamsburg, Va., for a declaration demanding
the Soviets negotiate the withdrawal of their intermediate-range
nuclear missiles from Asia as well as Europe.
   Japan, of course, backed Reagan, and the president prevailed.
Four years later, he signed a treaty with Gorbachev for the
destruction of all U.S. and Soviet medium-range missiles _ in Asia
as well as in Europe.
   At the Tokyo summit in 1987 a strong declaration against
terrorism emerged from heated debate among the leaders. The
decision was not pre-cooked by the aides, known popularly as
``sherpas.'' It was taken by the leaders, themselves.
   And last year, tough bargaining at the table in Paris produced
the decision to set up a group of 24 nations to channel assistance
to Poland and Hungary, which were shaking free from the Soviet
orbit.
   Only last week in Paris, the 24 countries decided to expand
their program to Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.
   At this point, said the U.S. official who discussed the issue on
condition he not be identified, the three most likely ways of
resolving the Soviet aid problem at the summit are these:
   _Declaring each of the seven nations can decide for itself
whether to help Gorbachev. That would mean Bush and Kaifu would not
stand in the way of Kohl and Mitterrand while maybe helping the
Soviets in less dramatic ways, such as with technical advice.
   _Appointing a panel to study the issue. That would give the
leaders possibly a year to make their minds up while monitoring how
Gorbachev proceeds with his experimentation with capitalistic ways.
   _Setting out conditions in the declaration for direct aid to
Moscow. They could include requirements for less military spending
and a reduction or cutoff of aid to Cuba.
   Only a few months ago, when Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.,
proposed a package of direct U.S. aid to rescue Gorbachev, the
Congressman was ridiculed by administration officials and some of
Bush's strongest supporters, such as Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.
   But now, it is a real possibility, causing Bush to think hard
about the consequences if the Soviet leader falls.
   Canada's Mulroney stressed that theme, saying ``If he were
chucked out by some of the extreme right influences we see at play
in the Soviet party conference that is ongoing in Moscow today, I
think we would be at an infinitely worse position than we are
today.''
   And yet, Mulroney called Soviet aid to Cuba ``profoundly
unacceptable'' and an obstacle to Western aid.
   He said Canada was willing at this point to provide trade
credits, not direct assistance.
   Meanwhile, Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, left no
doubt where the Margaret Thatcher's government stands.
   The summit's message to Moscow, he said, should be ``mend the
hole in the pants before you fill the pockets with dimes and
cents.''
   But no one doubts that a lot more than small change is at stake.

   Authorities can't find rhyme or reason to
the theft of a statue commemorating the little lamb that followed
19th-century resident Mary Sawyer to school one day.
   The heist has vexed some residents who believe they've been
robbed of a piece of history.
   ``I can't understand anybody taking it,'' said Karen Gaylord, a
20-year resident and part-time spokeswoman for the Sterling Police
Department. ``It has great historical value to the town, but it's
not something that you could sell.''
   The concrete statute of the lamb hads stood on the town common
since the early 1960s and was a fixture of this central
Massachusetts town of 6,000, said Ruth Hopfmann of the Sterling
Historical Society.
   ``Innumerable people have stopped and gotten out of the car with
their children to see what the little animal was. It really has
attracted a lot of attention over the past 30 years,'' she said.
   Police theorize vandals removed the statue by rocking it back
and forth. The legs already were crumbling at the base, Gaylord
said. The statue was taken during the night of July 1, and a search
has revealed no clues, she said.
   ``We've been in dumpsters and behind buildings. We've been
everywhere,'' she said.
   The society already was planning a new statue and has raised
about $7,000 toward that, but Mrs. Hopfmann said residents had
hoped to install the original version among the society's
collection of artifacts.
   The statue was donated in 1962 by summer resident Alfred Altman,
who was president of the National Dairymen's Association in New
York.
   The legend dates to about 1816, when Mary Elizabeth Sawyer's
little lamb followed her to school, Mrs. Hopfmann said. The child
hid the lamb under her desk but when she went to the front of the
class it followed her, was discovered and banished to a shed.
   John Roulstone, a young man visiting the school that day
commemorated the event with three verses and in 1830 those were
included in a book of poems compiled by magazine editor Sarah
Josepha Hale, who added several more verses to the nursery rhyme.
   The lamb met with the sad fate of being gored by a cow, but its
fleece lived on in the form of two pairs of stockings. The legend
resurfaced in 1883 when Mary Sawyer, seeking to raise money to save
Boston's Old South Church, sold cards carrying the story of the
verse and wrapped with pieces of yarn from the unraveled stockings.

   Alien smugglers abducted two children in a
dispute over the $400 fee for sneaking them into the United States,
police said. The youngsters were later rescued.
   Two men snatched Maria Morales, 11, and Nasario Morales, 9, off
a downtown street Sunday after their mother told the smugglers she
could not pay them the agreed-upon fee for bringing the children
from Mexico, police said.
   Officers found the children several hours later, said Detective
Dick Heidesch. They and several other suspected illegal immigrants
were held by alien smugglers in a house but escaped by jumping out
a window, he said.
   They were reunited with their mother, Ernestina Cruz Bautista,
who apparently is in the United States legally, Heidesch said.
   Two people were arrested for investigation of kidnapping for
ransom, he said.

<TEXT>
   Fifty-five farm advocates and a pair of
well-behaved longhorn steers paraded next to Rice University
Monday, but the protest's tractors, like so many in summit-snarled
Houston, got stuck in traffic.
   The group of farmers and environmentalists said they had a beef
with President Bush's efforts toward an agriculture trade
agreement, one issue on the table at the seven-nation economic
summit.
   Motorcades and street-closings made a mess of usually congested
Houston arteries Monday morning, and a half-mile stroll down Fannin
Street by Redbone and Tumbleweed, two 1,400-pound farm advocates
from Barker, Texas, only made the going slower.
   A dozen tractors from outlying farm communities never made it
inside Houston's freeway loop, organizer Craig Merrilees said.
   The demonstrators claimed Bush's plan for agriculture under a
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would undercut prices for
American farmers, and allow imports of cheaper foods grown with
pesticides not allowed in the United States.
   ``It is the final nail in the coffin of the family farmer, and
it may be the final nail in all our coffins,'' said Lana Nelson,
daughter of country singer Willie Nelson.
   Bush has been pushing for a plan to phase-out farm subsidies
over the next 10 years. Europeans have been resisting the idea,
which doesn't sit well with small-scale American farmers, either.
   Carl King, corn cobs pictured on his tie, said farmers would
accept a GATT agreement ``if its fair.''
   ``If we open everything up, there will be no fairness involved
because you're going to be competing with farms that have peon
labor overseas and that don't have to deal with regulations from
OSHA or EPA,'' King said.
   ``We just want to see the farmers get their price from the
marketplace,'' said Don Vig, a Valley City, N.D., farmer with the
National Family Farm Coalition. ``But we object to the way Bush
wants to do it.''
   The steers, sporting gold finials on their horns, were the
centerpiece of the ragtag, half-mile march down one lane of
traffic. Houston parks officials wouldn't allow the hungry animals
on the grass of Hermann Park, so they kept to the street.
   A few German and Japanese farmers joined the march. ``With GATT,
you tear down all the barriers that protect a people's own culture,
and the farmers are the first to be hit,'' said Pieter Bricke, a
Bonn economist who marched with his wife, Johanna, a farmer.

<HEAD>Arkansas School District Takes Quake Prediction Seriously</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILSON, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A northeast Arkansas school district is
taking a forecaster's prediction to heart and has tentatively
planned an early December earthquake break.
   The South Mississippi County School District No. 57 won't hold
classes on Dec. 3-4, if the school board approves, in deference to
climatologist Iben Browning's prediction of a major earthquake
along the New Madrid Fault during that time.
   Browning claims to have accurately predicted last fall's
Northern California earthquake within one day. He also says he
correctly predicted the 1971 earthquake in California's San
Fernando Valley, a deadly earthquake in Nicaragua in 1972 and
eruption of the Mount St. Helens volcano in 1980.
   South Mississippi County Superintendent Harvey Barton said he is
taking Browning seriously. Browning has predicted a quake for Dec.
2 or 3, a Sunday and Monday. The district, north of Memphis, Tenn.,
has canceled classes on Dec. 3 and 4. It will use that time for
staff development days mandated by the state Department of
Education, Barton said.
   ``Because we are a large rural area covering approximately 400
square miles, transporting students would be a hardship if we
should have an earthquake,'' Barton said.
   The New Madrid seismic zone stretches roughly from northeast
Arkansas northward to southern Illinois.
   Communities that make up the South Mississippi County School
District are within 30 miles of Marked Tree, the center of a series
of great earthquakes measuring as high as 8.5 on the Richter scale
that rocked the area during the winter of 1811-12. U.S. Geological
Survey scientists consider those the strongest series of quakes in
the nation's recorded history.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Monday that it
condemned a call for stepped up military action from leftist
guerrillas in El Salvador.
   The rebels said Saturday that a renewed offensive was needed to
end El Salvador's long civil war.
   ``Cynicism and illogic underpin this appalling announcement,''
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. ``We condemn it
unequivocally. There is no explanation or excuse for returning to
violence.''
   Boucher said a renewal of violence ``would be the ultimate show
of bad faith'' and could destroy negotiations for a settlement of
the war.
   ``Peace requires an end to the bloodshed, not more violence,''
he said.

   Bernard Perricone, the youngest of the
world's first documented male quadruplets to survive, has died at
age 60.
   Perricone died Sunday at a Nederland hospital after a heart
attack, said his brother Donald.
   Bernard, Donald, Anthony and Carl Perricone were born on
Halloween night, 1929, in a Beaumont farmhouse without electricity.
Their parents, immigrants from Italy, already had five sons and had
hoped for a girl.
   The Perricone quads were only the second documented quadruplets
in the country.
   All four served in the same unit of the Army for seven months in
Korea after receiving special permission arranged by then-Sen.
Lyndon B. Johnson. Army policy normally prohibits brothers from
serving in the same unit.
   Following military service, all four worked for Pure Oil Co.,
which has become Union Oil.
   After Bernard retired from the refinery's clerical department,
he managed a warehouse with his wife, Mildred, until his death.
   He is survived by his wife, eight brothers, including Anthony,
Donald and Carl, and three children.
   Services were scheduled for Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   President Bush welcomed leaders of the world's
major industrial democracies to the economic summit Monday with a
charge to work for ``new stability and prosperity'' in a world
``where all that seems possible is possible.''
   Bush conferred privately with French President Francois
Mitterrand and then with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl before
the mid-afternoon formal opening of the summit.
   In remarks prepared the afternoon ceremony, Bush said, ``These
economic summits have become a framework for frank, constructive
dialogue, a dialogue for progress that I believe will be advanced
greatly in these next three days.''
   ``Together we are called upon as allies and as friends to work
toward decisions here in Houston that will bring new stability and
prosperity to the world, by tapping the power and energy of free
wills and free markets,'' Bush said.
   He said, ``A new world of freedom lies before us, hopeful,
confident, a world where peace endures, where commerce has
conscience, where all that seems possible is possible. So let us
begin, in good faith, to set the stage for the new millennium.''
   Bush met first with Mitterrand, giving Kohl a little more time
to rest up from his overnight flight from Rome, where he watched
the West German 1-0 triumph over Argentina in Sunday's World Cup
final.
   Bush later greeted Kohl with a jaunty thumbs-up, saying,
``Welcommen! Hail the champions of football.'
   ``World champions! It's a big win for Germany,'' said Bush, who
later boasted that Bush had played soccer himself on a championship
team at Yale in the 1940s.
   Mitterrand flew the speedier Concorde to Houston this morning,
then flew by helicopter to the Bayou Club, a polo field near Bush's
Houstonian Hotel. After a short motorcade, Bush was waiting to
greet Mitterrand at the Houstonian's Manor House, but both leaders
declined to answer reporters' questions about whether the Western
allies can forge a common position on bailing out the Soviets'
stumbling economy.
   As they sat across a table in a cool, green-shaded sun room at
the back of Manor House, Bush waved off questions directed at
Mitterrand, saying, ``This is a photo opportunity. President
Mitterrand does not take questions at photo opportunities, and I'm
defending his right not to take questions.''
   ``Nice try,'' Bush told reporters who directed their inquiry at
his guest.
   Then, as the media was ushered out of the room, Bush extended
his arms and said, ``Well, welcome to the travelers. I'm very
pleased you're here.''
   The Soviet aid issue loomed as the largest facing the 16th
annual gathering of the world's richest nations, with Bush on one
side, Kohl and Mitterrand on the other.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has appealed to Bush, as
summit host, for economic help. But so far, Bush has opposed any
immediate funneling of Western cash into the foundering Soviet
economy, while Kohl is pushing a $15 million package which could,
in turn, enhance Kremlin support of German reunification.
   The summit partners were down to business after Bush played host
to a weekend welcoming party that had some of his guests slurping
Texas barbecue, tossing horseshoes and applauding rodeo tricks.
   Both Mitterrand and Kohl, arriving today, missed Bush's
larger-than-life hoedown at the AstroArena.
   ``Tomorrow we get to work. I think we're all working for the
same thing, for world peace and for harmony,'' Bush said at the end
of a Grand Old Opry performance featuring Larry Gatlin, comedian
Minnie Pearl and Charley Pride and Loretta Lynn.
   The evening saw some unlikely sights as the foreign visitors
gamely tried to emulate Bush's exuberance for country fun.
   Margaret Thatcher, smartly dressed in a white and tan spring
suit and clutching a white handbag, gingerly tripped over the
indoor rodeo dirt in her impeccable spectator shoes.
   Toshiki Kaifu wildly waved a Stetson, matinee-cowboy style,
above his head as he was announced into the rodeo arena.
   And a bluejean-clad Brian Mulroney tried his darndest to pitch
horseshoes on astroturf topped with sawdust.
   No matter that some of the foreign guests looked a bit stiff
standing in a buffet barbecue line, plates outstretched for potato
salad and ribs. Or that the unmistakable county-fair smell of
barnyard animals filled the air where sequined cowboys showed them
lassos and saddles.
   This after all, was the ambiance of his adopted hometown, which
Bush was eager to show off to guests who met a year ago in Paris.
   Mulroney, European Community President Jacques DeLors and Bush
wore the specially crafted cowboy boots given to each leader by
local bootmaker Rocky Carroll.
   Kaifu didn't wear his boots, but took great pride in showing off
to Mulroney the huge western belt buckle that he wore with gray
slacks, plaid jacket and loud print shirt.
   The evening capped a day when Bush remained true to his
proclivity for engaging foreign heads of state in sports and
relaxation. He shot some baskets with Mulroney in the elaborate
gymnasium of the Houstonian hotel complex where Bush stays when he
is in town.
   He attended morning church services with Thatcher.

<HEAD>Jury Begins Deliberations in McMartin Pre-School Retrial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge presiding over Raymond Buckey's
second molestation trial told jurors today they must not consider
public opinion in their deliberations of charges involving the
defunct McMartin Pre-School.
   The case was placed in the jury's hands after Superior Court
Judge Stanley Weisberg delivered 30 minutes of legal instructions.
   Buckey, 32, is being tried for the second time on eight counts
of child molestation at the now-demolished school his family owned
in Manhattan Beach. He took the stand in both trials to deny he
ever molested children.
   The retrial, which lasted just three months, followed a nearly
three-year odyssey that became the nation's longest and costliest
criminal proceeding, with costs topping $13.5 million. It has been
nearly seven years since Buckey was first arrested.
   Weisberg told jurors they must not base their decision on
``public opinion or public feeling'' about the notorious case.
   ``You must base your decision on the facts and the law,'' he
said. ``You must not be biased against the defendant because he has
been arrested for this crime or because he was brought to trial.''
   Attending the hearing were a number of parents of former
McMartin students, who had pressured District Attorney Ira Reiner
to pursue a retrial against Buckey.
   The first trial ended Jan. 18 with Buckey's mother, Peggy
McMartin Buckey, acquitted of all charges and Buckey acquitted on
40 counts of sexually abusing children at the school.
   Jurors deadlocked on 13 other charges against him, however, and
prosecutors refiled on eight of those counts.
   The second trial involved testimony from three young girls, who
claimed Buckey molested them when they were students at the
preschool.
   The defense alleged the children were influenced by therapists
who interviewed them in the early stages of the case, and suggested
their testimony was unreliable.
   Prosecutors said the children should be believed, although they
acknowledged their memories had faded over the years.
   The judge told jurors in his instructions: ``You should not
discount or distrust the testimony of a child, or give it greater
weight, solely because the witness is a child.''

   The chairman of a Senate panel said today he
would seek to subpoena former top thrift regulator M. Danny Wall
and a former aide to President Bush to explain how an Arizona man
could buy 15 failing Texas savings and loans by putting up only
$1,000 of his own money.
   ``I expect each of them. ... They owe the public an
explanation,'' said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, chairman of the
Senate subcommittee on antitrust, monopolies and business rights.
   Among those to be subpoenaed within a week, Metzenbaum said, are
Wall, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board;
insurance executive James M. Fail of Phoenix, and Robert J.
Thompson, a lobbyist and former congressional liaison for Bush when
he was vice president.
   Metzenbaum's panel is investigating a federally approved deal in
December 1988 in which Fail was promised $1.8 billion in subsidies
while putting up only $1,000 of his own money and borrowing $70
million to buy 15 S&amp;Ls consolidated into the Dallas-based
Bluebonnet Savings.
   Metzenbaum said that Wall, Fail and Thompson refused to appear
voluntarily before his panel.
   Thompson, according to Metzenbaum's investigators, pushed for
approval of the Fail deal, and in 1989 borrowed more than $500,000
from companies controlled by Fail.
   Metzenbaum said federal payments amounting to $23 million a
month helped Bluebonnet become the nation's most profitable large
savings and loan last year.
   Wall told The New York Times: ``I did nothing for Bob Thompson
that I didn't do for anyone else. There is nothing nefarious about
it.''
   Efforts to contact Fail, Thompson and Wall were unsuccessful
Sunday.
   Investigators said Fail was allowed to acquire the institutions
even though a company he controlled pleaded guilty o fraud in
Alabama in 1976. Fail was indicted for securities fraud in that
case, but the charges against him were dropped and he agreed not to
conduct any new business in the state.
   The congressional panel is trying to determine why the bidding
process for the failed S&amp;Ls was concluded quickly, why some federal
bank board officials who raised questions about Fail were
overruled, and what role was played by Thompson.
   ``The political implications of this deal need a lot of
explaining,'' Metzenbaum said. ``It appears from this particular
instance the negotiators did not do their job very well.''
   George M. Barclay, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank in
Dallas, acknowledged in a telephone interview Sunday that he wrote
a letter overruling staff objections to Fail's eligibility for the
deal. The letter to federal regulators was necessary for Fail's
approval as a buyer.
   He said he could not recall why he came to that conclusion but
acknowledged he may have acted in response to telephone calls from
officials in Washington. But he said ``it's absolutely not true
that anybody attempted to influence me,'' and that the letter
raised a flag for regulators by mentioning Fail's past indictment.
   He said the bank only certified to federal regulators ``that we
felt based upon the information we had that we had no objection, no
legal objection, to his acquiring the institution'' and that the
bank would be able to properly regulate Fail's new institution.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board's regulatory functions were
taken away and replaced by the Office of Thrift Supervision, an arm
of the Treasury Department, as part of the federal bailout of the
savings and loan industry passed by Congress last year.

<HEAD>Rapist Gets Lenient Sentence For Taking AIDS Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who pleaded guilty to raping a Columbia
University freshman got a reduced sentence because he agreed to be
tested for AIDS, according to published reports.
   Reginald Darby, 28, pleaded guilty in March to first-degree rape
in the knife-point assault on a 17-year-old in her dormitory room,
the reports said.
   In a secret deal with the district attorney's office, Darby was
promised that he would be sentenced to no more than five to 15
years if he submitted to the test, according to Monday's editions
of The New York Times and the July-August issue of Manhattan Lawyer.
   The maximum sentence for a first-degree rape conviction is eight
and one-third to 25 years, they noted. Sentencing is scheduled for
Aug. 3.
   Lisa Friel, an assistant prosecutor, said on the court record
that the sentence was ``contingent upon the defendant submitting to
certain testing and making the results of the test available to the
district attorney's office and other appropriate parties.''
   Neither Darby's attorney, Charles Blakeley of the Legal Aid
Society, nor Friel would confirm that the test was for AIDS.
   But other Legal Aid attorneys told Manhattan Lawyer that it was
an AIDS test and said it was the first time that Legal Aid had
worked out such a plea agreement for a rape defendant in Manhattan.
   However, there are questions about the usefulness of the test.
If the rapist tests negative, it does not guarantee that the victim
is not at risk for AIDS because a person may be infected with AIDS
and not yet have produced the antibodies detected by the most
common test.
   And if the rapist tests positive, the victim may not have
contracted the disease.
   Under New York law, those charged with rape cannot be compelled
to submit to AIDS tests. At least eight states _ Illinois, Oregon,
Washington, Indiana, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas and Colorado _
provide for mandatory AIDS testing in some cases, the Times said.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Soviets Making Progress Toward Dismantling Radar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has shown progress toward
dismantling the Krasnoyarsk radar in Siberia that it has said it
will remove because it is in violation of the U.S.-Soviet
antiballistic missile treaty, the State Department said Monday.
   Department spokesman Richard Boucher, asked about the status of
the radar installation, said, ``We have indications that
preparations are under way to begin dismantlement of the radar,
including the removal of some external equipment.''
   The department had said several months ago that indications were
the Soviets were preparing to dismantle the radar.
   What was new in Boucher's statement was the part about removing
external equipment. He declined to elaborate on it.
   ``Certainly the removal of some external equipment is progress,
but what really matters is the complete elimination of the radar,''
he said.
   Boucher declined to give any timetable for the removal. The
United States has said, however, that it hopes to sign a strategic
nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union by the end of the year
and will not do so until the radar has been dismantled.
   An administration official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said some of the external equipment had already been
removed from the radar installation.
   ``Something is being removed,'' the official said. ``Whether
that involves actual dismantlement of the radar is something that I
don't think we are prepared to say. External equipment has been
removed, but that doesn't necessarily qualify as parts of the
radar.''

<HEAD>Conservatives Back Socialists On Strong Military Stand</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Socialist defense minister won praise from the
conservative opposition Monday for pledging to maintain France as
Western Europe's top military power and adhere to its maverick
nuclear policy.
   In his address Sunday, Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement also
said France plans to keep its 50,000 troops in Germany for at least
four more years.
   Chevenement was right to declare that ``all the dangers haven't
disappeared miraculously, and that France must keep the means of
defending its territory, its expatriates and its positions in
different parts of the world,'' said Pierre-Andre Wiltzer, an
opposition legislator.
   Wiltzer, a defense specialist for the center-right Union for
French Democracy, said there was a national consensus to maintain a
strong military. He said the defense budget should not be reduced.
   Some Socialists have urged cuts in defense spending, but
Chevenement thus far has the support of President Francois
Mitterrand in opposing major budget reductions.
   Chevenement recalled that France refused to endorse a
declaration at last week's NATO summit stipulating that the
alliance would use nuclear weapons only as a last resort.
   ``It was in our interests to refuse to go along with this idea
that one uses nuclear weapons as a last resort, when all would be
lost,'' he said at a forum Sunday.
   France would stick with its ``completely opposite'' strategy of
nuclear deterrence, he said. ``This is extremely important for
France and for Europe.''
   Surveys have shown that French voters across the political
spectrum want to keep an independent ``force de frappe,'' as the
country's nuclear arsenal is called.
   France ``is the biggest military power in Europe'' after the
Soviet Union, Chevenement said, and must maintain its capabilities.
   ``In five years, there will be a strategic void, which is very
dangerous because a void of arms can lead to outside interference.''
   Wiltzer sounded a similar note in his statement.
   ``If France is a nation that counts in Europe and the world,
it's due in large part to its defense. To cast doubt on the
coherence and credibility of this policy under the pretext of
budget cuts or because of internal rivalries in the Socialist Party
would be irresponsible.''
   Chevenement rejected any suggestion that French troops withdraw
from Germany by the end of the year.
   ``That won't happen for at least four or five years,'' he said,
adding that withdrawal even then would depend on actions of the
Soviet Union and coordination with Western allies.
   Chevenement said the eventual withdrawal of the 50,000 French
troops would fit in with plans to trim the armed forces by 35,000.
   The defense minister said the tentative withdrawal plans have no
bearing on a newly formed joint French-German brigade.

<TEXT>
   Habitat for Humanity's founder is keeping
some people at arm's length while its leaders and backers struggle
with allegations that he improperly hugged and touched five female
workers.
   The allegations have sent founder Millard Fuller into near exile
and put an uncharacteristic strain on Habitat, a strongly religious
organization that uses ``sweat equity'' to build housing for the
poor around the world. It has a $50 million budget and 100,000 U.S.
volunteers, including former President Carter.
   ``It has been a situation that has caused a lot of pain because
we're all very close,'' said Claire Williams, spokeswoman for
Habitat's board.
   Fuller, who says he only touched the women in exuberant shows of
friendship, still can be found chatting with Habitat volunteers.
But he avoids the headquarters and is careful how he greets people.
   ``I no longer initiate hugs,'' he said in an interview Thursday.
``When charges of this nature are made, it's very difficult to
defend yourself.''
   No criminal charges have been filed against Fuller, 55. The
women have not been identified, and their allegations have been
described only in general terms.
   Geoff Van Loucks, chairman of Habitat for Humanity International
Inc., has said the women alleged ``nothing criminal'' when they
complained to a Habitat chaplain.
   ``They claim inappropriate comments and inappropriate hugging
and touching. They've never, ever claimed anything more. Nor is
there a hint of anything more,'' Van Loucks said. ``Let me make
clear there was no sexual intercourse.''
   Fuller, who founded Habitat with his wife, Linda, also is to
move his base of operations to Atlanta. Because of a reorganization
that was planned before the controversy, he has gone from executve
director to president.
   The organization also hired the Mennonite Conciliation Service
to counsel Fuller and the women. But there have been divisions over
whether enough has been done.
   Tim O'Donnell, who recently finished a 2{-year term at the
headquarters, said he received a harsh handwritten note from Carter
after O'Donnell complained about the way the board investigated the
claims against Fuller.
   ``You are either completely foolish or trying to sabotage the
work of Habitat,'' said a copy of the letter provided by O'Donnell.
``Attacking Millard Fuller and the board of directors is a
reprehensible act. ... Don't make it more difficult for those
trying to resolve the problem.''
   Carter spokeswoman Carrie Harmon declined to comment on the
letter's authenticity.
   Carter, who annually spends at least a week working at Habitat
homebuilding projects, has publicly defended Fuller. In a recent
interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, he said the nature
of the accusations upset the ``extremely conservative'' board
members, who then were ``overly inclined to condemn'' Fuller.
   Fuller still is a visible presence in Americus, a town of 16,000
about 10 miles from Carter's hometown of Plains. Fuller now works
out of his law office, a few blocks from Habitat's headquarters.
   Fuller, a former millionaire who gave away his money in 1970 and
founded Habitat in 1976, said he has apologized to all five women
and met personally with three of them.
   ``When someone says they have been offended, the common-sense
thing and the Christian thing is to seek reconciliation,'' he said.
``I'm not trying to paint myself as a perfect person who has been
victimized. I obviously was not sensitive enough in my relations
with these women.''
   Back at Habitat headquarters, California businessman Jeff
Snider, who arrived Thursday, has taken over as executive vice
president in charge of operations.
   As a reporter arrived, a male employee greeted a female
receptionist with a hug.
   Ms. Williams, the board spokeswoman, said, ``We've seen progress
in the two or three months it's been going on.''
   But O'Donnell said the controversy has taken a toll at the
organization, which has over 450 projects in the United States,
Canada and Australia and more than 80 in 26 developing countries.
   ``People almost feel they have to take sides,'' he said. ``I
know of a handful of people who have left because of the
situation.''
   Fuller said he wants to focus on the future.
   He said his promotion to president and the opening of a Habitat
office in Atlanta are part of a long-range plan developed last year
that just happened to coincide with the controversy. Fuller said he
helped pick Snider to run Habitat.
   ``Because of the timing, it appears that I'm being run out of
town,'' said Fuller. ``I want us to get on with the business of
building houses for the needy.''

   Leaders of the world's richest nations began
their 16th economic summit today, urged by President Bush to
harness ``the power and energy of free wills and free markets'' to
bolster the troubled economies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union.
   The seven leaders were deeply divided on how and when to provide
financial assistance sought by Mikhail Gorbachev, but officials
said a team of western bankers and other experts would be sent to
assess Soviet needs.
   As the meetings began, the leaders lined up ``about half on one
side, and half on the other'' over how to extend financial
assistance to Mikhail Gorbachev, said White House chief of staff
John Sununu.
   Bush has said he has ``big problems'' with extending direct aid
to Moscow until it reduces military spending, moves more forcefully
toward a free-market system and curtails the $5 billion a year
subsidy to Cuba. A Gorbachev aide said Monday that western aid must
be unconditional, explaining, ``We aren't taking orders.''
   Bush met this morning with Francois Mitterrand and a French
spokesman said both men stuck to their position: Bush opposes
direct aid _ at least for now _ while Mitterrand favors ``all aid
that is serious and useful.''
   Officials said the leaders would approve an assessment team to
recommend applications for western assistance. Sununu said the
study might be conducted by a mixture of western financing
agencies, including the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund.
   Bush is offering the Soviets technical assistance for
transportation and agriculture and advice on developing free-market
mechanisms. Sununu pointed out that the Soviets currently lose
almost half their grain crop through faulty storage.
   Sununu noted that different countries view Soviet circumstances
in different ways, perhaps a hint that Bush will not staunchly
oppose direct aid from France, West Germany and Italy _ nations
that are ready to proceed. Also meeting here are leaders from
Britain, Japan, Canada and the European Economic Community.
   ``We are called upon as allies and as friends to work toward
decisions that will bring new stability and prosperity to the
world, by tapping the power and energy of free wills and free
markets,'' Bush said in a statement opening the summit.
   ``These economic summits have become a framework for frank,
constructive dialogue, a dialogue for progress that I believe will
be advanced greatly in these next three days. A new world of
freedom lays before us. Hopeful. Confident. A world where peace
endures, where commerce has conscience, where all that seems
possible is possible.
   ``So let us begin, in good faith, to set the stage for the new
millennium.''
   Soviet aid questions were a highly charged and undecided issue
as the three-day summit began. Decisions were likely to come
Wednesday in a final communique.
   From Moscow came a fresh plea for financial assistance. Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told reporters at the Communist Party
Congress,``I feel it would be advantageous, for us and the West.''
He said Moscow was looking to the west for ``credit, technical
cooperation, personnel training, joint ventures and joint
projects.''
   Meanwhile, the summit partners faced a tangle of their own
differences over trade and the environment. Europeans are resisting
Bush's demand for phasing out farm subsidies over the next 10 years
and, together with Canada, are pushing for agreement on new steps
to halt global warming.
   Sununu sniped at European critics of Bush's go-slow policy on
curbing carbon dioxide and other pollutants blamed for warming the
global environment.
   ``I think West Germany got a lot of good grades for rhetoric,''
he said on ABC. ``If you take a good look at what the United States
has actually done in terms of cleaning up our environment ... I
don't think the United States has to take a back seat to anyone.''
Yet, a prominent U.S. environmental group, the Wilderness Society,
quickly chimed in to say, ``the U.S. gets a failing grade, no
matter how Governor Sununu tries to rejigger the numbers.''
   Before calling the summit into session on the campus of Rice
University, Bush met separately with Mitterand and West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl to discuss their $15-billion aid proposal
for Moscow.
   The world has changed dramatically since the last economic
summit in Paris. At that time, the West was considering a limited
aid package to encourage the beginings of reform efforts in Poland
and Hungary.
   Since that time the Berlin Wall has crumbled and most of the
communist nations of Eastern Europe have been swept away, leaving
the West groping for a way to respond to the dramatic changes.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said today the chief message
from Houston will be to urge East European nations to undertake
necessary economic reforms before they receive Western assistance.
   ``There's no sense in pouring money into a system that isn't
ready to receive it,'' he said on NBC.''
   Despite temperatures in the 90s and humidity topping 80 percent,
the city of Houston went all out to welcome the heads of
government, their contingents and hordes of reporters. Air
conditioning was pumped onto the outddor platform to make the
arrival ceremony comfortable for the leaders.
   Bush was host Sunday night to a pre-summit rodeo, complete with
bareback riding, barrel racing and a calf scramble.
   Japan's Toshiki Kaifu, a first-time summiteer, waived his cowboy
hat as if he'd been doing it all his life.
   Mitterrand, Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti and Kohl
delayed their arrival until today. Kohl was in Rome to watch his
West German team win soccer's World Cup; Andreotti was there to
present it.
   Bush had been in Houston since Friday, arriving from London,
where he saw the NATO allies adopt a U.S. proposal to rewrite
NATO's war-fighting strategy as a way of lessening tensions with
the Soviet Union.
   Bush, as summit host, received a letter from Gorbachev appealing
for western help. Gorbachev's latest plea was expected to be aired
fully during a working dinner tonight.
   Pressing the Soviet case, foreign ministry spokesman Gennady
Gerasimov said Moscow was shrinking its military and moving toward
a market-price system that would curtail Moscow's huge subsidies to
Cuba.

   A day after cheering their soccer team to
victory in the World Cup, Germans woke up Monday to hear of deaths,
broken glass and looted shops, the aftermath of extremist rioting
in both German states.
   Four people were killed and hundreds hurt when jubilant street
celebrations turned reckless and violent following West Germany's
1-0 victory over Argentina in Rome on Sunday.
   Bands of neo-Nazi skinheads and other hooligans brawled with
police in East Berlin and in the West German cities of Hamburg and
Bielefeld.
   Foreigners were singled out for attacks, and stores were looted
and vandalized nationwide, police said.
   More than 120 people were arrested and at least 60 police
officers were among the injured.
   The celebration was far more violent and nationalistic than the
good-natured euphoria that followed West Germany's last cup
championship in 1974.
   It was also the first shared by East Germany, which is on the
threshold of unifying with its Western neighbor and rooted strongly
for its neighboring team.
   Unification and rising German influence on world affairs has
intensified patriotic feeling and spawned new extremism.
   ``I was astonished by what had happened last night,'' said
Detlev Liepmann, a sociologist at West Berlin's Free University.
``There is a special group at the right side of our spectrum who
are searching for any occasion to do these sort of things.''
   About 20,000 cheering, flag-waving fans greeted the West German
soccer team when it returned to Frankfurt Monday after taking the
championship.
   The peaceful display of pride was in sharp contrast to the ugly
scenes of random violence that broke out the night before and
lasted into the morning.
   Hundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets,
fireworks streaked the skies over several cities and a concert of
honking horns lasted into the morning.
   But in East Berlin, about 5,000 youths watching the game on a
huge television screen across from the Parliament building began
hurling bottles and demolishing concession stands when it ended.
   A group of 500 neo-Nazis shouting epithets against foreigners
rampaged on the main square, Alexanderplatz, chasing Vietnamese
workers and ransacking a bar frequented by homosexuals, police and
witnesses said.
   A group of about 200 skinheads later tried to attack a house
occupied by a leftist group, and fought pitched battles with police.
   Twelve were arrested and three people were seriously hurt,
police said.
   In Hamburg, about 400 hooligans and skinheads clashed with
police with rocks and bottles. Fifty-four police officers were
injured and 88 people were arrested, according to police.
   Windows of more than 20 stores were smashed, one bar was
destroyed and several police and private autos were damaged by the
mob, police said.
   Police used truncheons and water cannons to break up the crowd.
   In the West German city of Bielefeld, about 200 neo-Nazi
skinheads attacked police with rocks and firebombs. Six officers
were hurt and 13 people were arrested. Six police wagons were
damaged, authorities there said.
   In Cologne, a mob surrounded a car driven by an 18-year-old Turk
and threatened to lynch him, police said. The car was rocked and
three people were hurt when the motorist attempted to drive away.
   Anetta Kahane, head of the East Berlin office for foreigner
affairs, said Monday that Asians and Africans living in the country
are the target of daily attacks.
   Wolfgang Schoenpflug, a psychologist at the free University,
said resentment of foreigners is rising in both German states, some
of it influenced by East Germany.
   ``New emotions and attitudes are coming from the East, where
hostility against foreigners was suppressed but heavily present,''
he said.
   Four people died in accidents related to the celebrations and
hundreds were reported injured.
   In Cologne, a reveler died when he smashed a window in a moving
street car, leaned out and was struck by a concrete pillar, police
said.
   In the southwest West German city of Heilbronn, two people died
when their car slammed into a lamppost. In Geislingen, a speeding
car with four fans smashed into a post, killing one and seriously
injuring three.
   In the West German city of Schwetzingen, 37 people were injured
when a fan drove his car into a crowd of 5,000 people celebrating
in the street.

   A family whose members travel here each
year from Kentucky and Minnesota for Tom Sawyer Days seems to have
the makings of a fence painting dynasty.
   Tony Youngblood, 12, of Mayfield, Ky., did his part Sunday by
winning this year's fence painting contest. His cousin, Scott
McEndree, 13, of Minnetonka, Minn., was last year's champion.
   The contest is inspired by Tom Sawyer's fence-painting exploits
in Mark Twain's ``Tom Sawyer,'' which is set in Hannibal. In the
book, Tom gets friends to help him whitewash a fence by making the
hated chore appear fun.
   Tony got no such help. He did have the benefit of experience,
though, this being his third year as a contestant.
   His strategy for winning? ``Quality in painting and running,''
he said. ``Each year, I learn a little bit more.''
   The contestants were judged on authenticity of costume, as
described in Twain's writing, as well as speed and quality of
painting.
   As this year's champion, Tony will carry back to Kentucky the
governor's cup, which he will return to Hannibal next summer. He
also won readings by Twain, a plaque and a $500 U.S. Savings Bond.

   The 1990 Ernest Hemingway Foundation Award went to
Mark Richard for his short story collection ``The Ice at the Bottom
of the World,'' his first published book of fiction.
   The $7,500 award administered by the PEN association of writers
was presented Saturday at the Fourth International Hemingway
Conference. The conference is a biannual gathering that draws
scholars and aficionados of the novelist.
   Hemingway's widow, Mary, established the award in 1976 to honor
her husband's memory and noteworthy work by young writers.
   ``It's one of the major literary awards in America and in
particular for new writers _ it means Mark Richard is someone to
watch for,'' said Frank Rigg of the John F. Kennedy Library, where
the conference was held.
   Richard's stories have appeared in publications that include
Harper's, Esquire, Antaeus and Grand Street. His work was also
featured in the ``Best American Short Stories'' of 1989 and ``New
Stories from the South.''
   ``Mark Richard's stories are ambitious and successful,'' wrote
the judges. `We find the quintessentially American balancing act of
despair and high spirits.''
   Richard lives in New York City.

   Senior Soviet officials said Monday they would
welcome Western aid to help rebuild their country, but they
rejected attaching any conditions to such aid.
   Leaders of the world's seven richest nations convened in
Houston, Texas, on Monday and aid to Moscow was at the top of their
agenda.
   President Bush has said he has ``big problems'' with pouring
cash into an anemic Soviet economy that still supports heavy
defense spending and funnels $5 billion a year into Marxist Cuba.
   Deputy Premier Leonid Abalkin, in charge of Soviet economic
reform, appeared to rule out any conditions for the aid.
   ``Any political conditions are unacceptable for negotiations
with the Soviet Union,'' Abalkin said during a break in the 28th
Communist Party Congress.
   An aide to Mikhail S. Gorbachev said he viewed Bush's concerns
as conditions.
   ``To dictate conditions to such a country as the Soviet Union, a
great power, is embarrassing,'' said Gorbachev staff member Georgy
Shakhnazarov. ``We aren't taking orders.''
   The urgings from the West could also backfire, he warned,
playing into the hands of Soviet officials ``who consider that any
foreign help would be insulting.''
   Such officials, he said, believe accepting Western aid would
``mean we will be selling our national interests.''
   Gorbachev is worried his country cannot make the painful leap to
a market system without Western credits and wants help from the
industrial powers to stop Soviet economic decline.
   The most prominent conservative in the Soviet leadership, Yegor
K. Ligachev, said the West could try to push Moscow in a direction
he opposes.
   ``If conditions are attached to these lines of credit ... such
as a move toward a free market economy or private property, then
Ligachev is against it,'' he said at the party congress.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze was more conciliatory.
   ``We understand if no one wants to take a risk. The U.S.A. isn't
speaking in favor of development of economic cooperation if reform
doesn't proceed as we plan,'' he said.
   Such aid, he said, ``would be advantageous, for us and the
West.''
   Soviet officials offered their first detailed list of what kind
of help they want from the West.
   Shakhnazarov said the Soviet Union would like Western technology
for quick construction of small businesses to produce consumer
goods and food, items in short supply. Gorbachev has made
improvements in both a top priority.
   The Soviet economy also suffers from inflation and a huge budget
deficit.
   Help in organizing market mechanisms _ such as banking, finance
and management _ also are priorities, the Gorbachev aide said.
   In return, Shakhnazarov said, Moscow could offer the West help
in converting the defense industry to produce civilian goods.
Gorbachev has launched a program to tap highly developed defense
plants to assist the civilian sector.
   The leaders of West Germany and France advocate helping the
Soviet Union despite disagreements over Cuba, and have called for
$15 billion in aid to bolster reform plans.
   Asked whether the Soviet Union would cut aid to Cuba,
Shevardnadze said that was strictly ``a question of bilateral
relations,'' and did not indicate the government's plans.
   Credits would help Soviet businesses pay bills to Western
companies. The Soviet Union traditionally has been punctual in
making such payments and recent delays have eroded confidence among
foreign investors.
   West Germany already has granted an unconditional loan of $3.1
billion.
   Estimates of how much money the Soviet Union would need to begin
to stabilize its economy range from $5 billion to $20 billion.

   The average business executive spends
about 60 hours a year on hold on the telephone, according to a
survey.
   In the survey, commissioned by Accountemps, a personnel agency,
200 executives of the nation's 1,000 largest corporations were
questioned by an independent market research firm.
   They were asked how much time they spend on unnecessary
meetings, on unnecessary memos and on hold.
   The executives were not asked how much time other people spend
on hold waiting for them.
   The responses came out to 15 minutes a day on hold, or 60 hours
a year for an executive with four weeks' vacation; 32 minutes a day
reading and writing unnecessary memos, or 128 hours a year; and an
hour and 12 minutes a day at unnecessary meetings, or 288 hours a
year.

   Anti-apartheid leader Rev.
Allan Boesak resigned his church positions after press reports
alleged he was having an affair with a white television star,
church officials said Monday.
   Boesak was in seclusion and his lawyers said he had nothing to
say after telling his congregation Sunday that he was stepping
down. Boesak, who is married, said he had done nothing wrong but
had to resign.
   ``This is one of the darkest days of my life,'' he told the
congregation of the Ned Geref Sendingkerk church in Cape Town's
Bellville South area where he served for 21 years.
   ``I am deeply sorry for all the pain I have caused,'' he said.
   Boesak, a leader of the mixed-race community, had become a
prominent anti-apartheid leader in recent years. He helped lead
campaigns against white-minority rule and toured the world to
denounce apartheid.
   Boesak resigned after South African newspapers reported he was
romantically involved with Elna Botha, who works for the state
South African Broadcasting Corporation. Mrs. Botha is a star and
producer of ``Good Morning South Africa,'' a news and entertainment
show.
   Mrs. Botha's husband, TV news anchorman Colin Fluxman, was taken
off the air Monday after breaking down as he read a news report
about his wife and Boesak during ``Good Morning South Africa.''
   Business Day newspaper reported Monday that Fluxman said the
couple were divorcing.
   Church officials said Boesak and his wife, Dorothy, had not
decided whether they would divorce, according to news reports.
   Walter Sisulu, a senior leader of the African National Congress,
the main black opposition group, said Monday Boesak's resignation
would not harm the movement. Boesak has been an ANC ally.
   ``It's really a personal matter, a love affair is a personal
matter,'' Sisulu said at a press conference.
   The incident was seen as a moral rather than a racial scandal.
Apartheid legislation banning inter-racial sex was dropped in 1985.
   Boesak was temporarily suspended from his church posts in 1985
after allegations he was having an affair with a church worker. He
was later reinstated.
   Business Day also reported that Boesak was likely to devote
himself to a political career. He has strong ties to the African
National Congress and other anti-apartheid groups.
   Boesak is long thought to have had political ambitions that go
beyond his role in the anti-apartheid movement.
   Boesak modeled himself on American black civil rights leader
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. He developed a vivid speaking style and
often led non-violent marches and demonstrations.
   Rev. Johan Retief, leader of the council at Boesak's church,
said church leaders were stunned and trying to decide what to do.
``We do not take this lightly,'' he said.
   South African newspapers said Monday Boesak was also resigning
as moderator of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, an
international body of Protestant churches.

   Whatever their differences on a formal framework,
the prosperous Western democracies are gearing up for a
multi-billion-dollar effort to protect Mikhail Gorbachev from the
economic morass that threatens his hold on Soviet power.
   Long lines and restive consumers give ample evidence that
Gorbachev's economic reforms need an infusion of imagination and
cash.
   Inability to keep food stores stocked has already forced Moscow
to spend an extra 3 billion rubles _ $500 million _ on food
imports. The White House says half the Soviet grain crop goes bad
before it gets to the marketplace.
   The French and Germans want to provide billions of dollars, the
sooner the better. The United States leads a go-slow faction that
includes Japan and Britain. Even so, American officials are
briefing reporters at the economic summit on a U.S. drive to help
Soviet agriculture and transportation.
   Seventy-three years after the Russian revolution, Soviet
officials emphasized on Monday that assistance could not carry
Western conditions. ``We aren't taking orders,'' said Gorbachev
aide Georgy Shaknazarov.
   But Bush has three main objections to offering direct aid: the
Soviets' heavy military spending, their sending $5 billion a year
in aid to Marxist Cuba and their slow pace in adapting to
capitalistic ways.
   It was vaguely possible that summit leaders might attempt to set
specific conditions concerning one or more of those problems before
approving aid.
   The Soviets are open about their need for Western help. ``I feel
it would be advantageous, for us and the West,'' said Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. He said he disliked the term ``aid,''
preferring ``credit, technical cooperation, personnel training,
joint ventures and joint projects'' _ a message welcome to Bush.
   Only a year ago, the United States, Britain, France, Canada,
West Germany, Japan and Italy stepped gingerly into these uncharted
waters and decided to help Poland and Hungary. The Soviet Union
presents a far more difficult decision.
   Bush entered the summit discussions already committed to
providing technical assistance.
   That may be as far as he is ready to go _ for now. But Bush
doesn't seem to feel so strongly that he would try to block others
from more ambitious assistance. West Germany alone hopes to make
$3.1 billion in loans available and is leading the push for an
overall Western aid package in excess of $15 billion.
   ``The president has understood different countries may have
different ways of evaluating specific changes'' in the Soviet
Union, Chief of Staff John Sununu said Monday.
   From the French delegation, meanwhile, came a statement of
renewed determination to bolster Gorbachev and the Soviet economy
with ``all aid that is serious and useful.''
   The leaders may endorse diversity when they address aid to the
Soviet Union in their Wednesday communique. Each nation would be
free to go its separate way.
   But the summit nations are planning to act in concert in
dispatching teams of bankers and other experts to assess Soviet
needs.
   Failure of perestroika could mean Gorbachev's downfall and begin
an era of instability across the Soviet Union. Where would the West
be, asked Brian Mulroney of Canada, ``if they chuck him out?''
   U.S. officials make this kind of case for moving slowly.
   _ It is impossible to keep tabs on assistance. Many of the
billions could be diverted to the Red Army where the generals and
Gorbachev do not always see eye to eye.
   _ It doesn't make sense to send billions to the Soviets while
they are sending billions to Cuba, a state whose interests often
collide with the United States'. Mulroney agrees with Bush that
Soviet aid to Cuba is ``profoundly unacceptable,'' and he said
Canada was willing to provide trade credits, not direct assistance.
   _ The Soviet economy is so messed up that immediate aid will be
wasted. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said Monday: ``There's no
sense in pouring money into a system that isn't ready to receive
it.''

   The doctor who performed the world's first
successful liver transplant was recovering Monday following surgery
to remove blockage in one of his coronary arteries, officials said.
   Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, 64, was alert and resting comfortably at
Presbyterian-University Hospital, where he has performed hundreds
of transplants during the past nine years, said Dr. Bruce Wilson,
director of the University of Pittsburgh's Heart Institute.
   Doctors removed a severe blockage from Starzl's right coronary
artery Sunday after he complained of chest pains, Wilson said. The
artery was 99 percent blocked.
   ``He's doing quite well,'' Wilson told reporters. ``We expect a
speedy recovery.''
   Because the blockage was not total, Starzl's heart muscle did
not appear to be damaged, Wilson said. The two remaining arteries
``look pretty normal,'' he said.
   Starzl gained attention in 1967 when he performed the world's
first successful liver transplant at the University of Colorado. He
also pioneered the development of a medical team that performed 200
kidney transplants at Colorado General and Denver Veteran's
Administration hospitals.
   In 1981, Starzl began work at the University of Pittsburgh,
which he helped make the world's premier transplant center. Last
year, the hospital performed more than 460 liver transplants and
210 kidney transplants.
   Wilson said a severe blockage of the kind Starzl had can occur
suddenly when blood strips away crusted plaque lining the arteries
and causes a larger buildup farther along in the artery. People who
disregard the first symptoms of pain run the risk of a complete
blockage, which can cause a heart attack and permanent damage, he
said.
   Wilson said he will monitor Starzl's condition the next few days
and ask him to restrict his work schedule. But he added it may be
difficult to persuade the energetic surgeon to slow down.
   ``A person like Tom Starzl might have more stress if you inhibit
him,'' he said.

   A judge today denied a request to
postpone the case of Ramon Salcido, who is accused of killing seven
people in a wine country murder spree, clearing the way for the
trial to begin next week.
   Sonoma County Public Defender Marteen Miller requested a
continuance for at least two months, but prosecutors argued against
the delay and visiting Judge Reginald Littrell of Sierra County
agreed with them.
   Salcido, 29, is accused of murdering his wife, two of his
daughters, his mother-in-law, her two other daughters and a
co-worker in Sonoma County 15 months ago. A third daughter, whose
throat was slit, survived the attack.
   Miller, who claims his client has a brain dysfunction and also
was illegally extradited from Mexico, said last week he had ``more
than enough to justify a two-month continuance.''
   The exchanges between Miller and District Attorney Peter Bumerts
today were sometimes bitter. Salcido, who appeared in court with a
Spanish language interpreter, listened to the proceedings
attentively.
   At one point, Miller argued that a delay was justified because
``a man's life is at stake.''
   ``If Mr. Salcido had had the same consideration for the seven
people he killed, maybe we wouldn't be here,'' countered Bumerts.
   Investigators say Salcido killed his wife, Angela, because he
suspected she was unfaithful. He told authorities bouts with
alcohol and cocaine preceded the attacks.
   The case was moved to San Mateo County because of widespread
publicity. Miller had said he would seek a second change of venue
because of similar media coverage in the new locale, but no such
request was made today.
   Jury selection is due to begin next week after the lawyers and
the judge work out the list of questions to ask prospective jurors.
   Besides domestic distrust, investigators say Salcido was upset
because he had been ordered to make back child-support payments to
his first wife, a woman Angela Salcido had known nothing about
until the order. The couple had a daughter before they divorced.
   In statements to Sonoma County sheriff's detectives while
returning to the United States, he allegedly said he took his
daughters, Theresa, 1, Sofia, 4, and Carmina, 3, to a county dump
and slit their throats.
   Carmina survived and told police, ``Daddy cut me.''
   Salcido allegedly said he then drove to his in-laws' house,
where he knocked out his 47-year-old mother-in-law, Marion Louise
Richards, before cutting the throats of her daughters, Ruth, 12,
and Marie, 8. He stabbed their mother to death as she regained
consciousness, authorities said.
   Salcido allegedly said he then returned home, beat his wife and
shot her with a .22-caliber pistol.
   He told detectives he thought about killing himself but instead
drove to the Grand Cru Winery, where he worked, and fatally shot
co-worker Tracey Toovey, 35. Salcido said he then went to the house
of another co-worker, Ken Butti, 33, who was shot but survived.
   Miller has said he will argue that his client had an organic
brain dysfunction and was suffering from ``psychotic depression''
at the time of the slayings.

   A woman claiming to be armed with a
bomb and gun held several hostages in a bank lobby today while
police surrounded the building.
   The woman entered an NCNB Corp. branch in North Miami about
12:15 p.m., handed a teller a note, then ordered people from the
bank, said police dispatcher Michelle Stoll.
   Deputy Chief Larry Juriga said police contacted the woman by
telephone about 3 p.m. and began negotiations.
   He said police could not confirm the woman's identity or what
was written on the note.
   Ms. Stoll was not sure how many people left the bank or how many
remained inside. The dispatcher said that as far as she knew,
nothing had been seen of the alleged gun or bomb.
   Police blocked off a half-mile area around the bank. The FBI and
a SWAT team from the Metro-Dade Police Department was called to the
scene.
   Ms. Stoll said she did not believe the incident was a robbery
attempt.
   The bank is in the tree-lined main business district of the
small town a few miles north of Miami.

   Gov. Buddy Roemer said Monday he had
questions about the constitutionality of a record labeling bill
that could become the first law of its kind in the nation.
   Roemer said he favors warning labels on objectionable recordings
but would prefer that the industry do it voluntarily.
   The industry has begun a voluntary labeling program, but it was
not stringent enough for the Legislature, which overwhelmingly
passed the bill Saturday. The measure also bans the sale of labeled
records to minors.
   The measure was approved a day before the Legislature passed a
bill that could become the nation's most stringent state abortion
law.
   Roemer, who is still pondering the abortion measure, also said
he had not decided whether to sign or veto the record labeling
bill. It would mandate labels for recordings with themes of rape,
murder, suicide, incest, illegal drug use, child abuse and satanic
worship.
   During a news conference, Roemer said he had serious legal
questions about the bill's constitutionality. Those questions have
to be balanced with concerns about the content of some recordings,
he said.
   Roemer said most of the industry was acting responsibly, but
``some portions of the industry produce pure trash. Parents don't
know that until they are brought home and played.''
   The governor said he preferred a voluntary program, similar to
the ratings system adopted by the movie industry. ``We'll all be
better off,'' he said.
   In May, the recording industry unveiled a voluntary labeling
system that it hoped would halt state campaigns for mandatory
labeling. Industry spokesmen said every legislature except
Louisiana's pulled back their bills while the voluntary program was
tested.
   The voluntary program went into effect this month, and labeled
recordings already are showing up in stores, said Mike Cutshaw, an
attorney representing the National Association of Recording
Merchandisers.
   Last week, Capitol Records promised to provide legal help to
store operators who are threatened with arrest for selling its
recordings that bear labels warning consumers of sexually explicit
lyrics.
   Although the labeling bill passed both chambers with more than
the two-thirds vote needed to override a veto, the Legislative
session was to end Monday night and a veto would kill it until the
next session, which begins in April. Roemer has 20 days to decide
on the bill after it reaches his desk.
   Under the legislation, record manufacturers would be required to
label recordings with objectionable lyrics. Retailers would be
subject to misdemeanor criminal penalties for selling labeled
recordings to those under age 17.
   The producers of the Grammy Awards show have said such a law
would scuttle Louisiana's chances of being host of the event. Also,
backers of a proposed Grammy Hall of Fame in New Orleans say the
law would end their project and cost the city $100 million a year.
   State Rep. Ted Haik, the bill's sponsor, told reporters he
believed the bill was constitutional. He said that unlike the movie
industry, the recording industry is spread out among companies of
all sizes and difficult to regulate voluntarily.
   The legislation would not take effect until 1992. Haik has said
that if the industry implements its voluntary program, he would
push for repeal of the law.

Monday at the economic summit:
   Well, welcome to Houston. And we think this city a very
appropriate place to host this economic summit, not of the post-war
era, but of the post-post-war era.
   And over the past decade and a half, the leaders of the largest
industrialized democracies have held these summits to address
common problems and challenges.
   These economic summits have become a framework for frank and
constructive dialogue, a dialogue for progress that I believe will
be advanced greatly in these next three days.
   And together we're called upon as allies and as friends to work
toward decisions here in Houston that will bring a new stability
and prosperity to the world _ by tapping the power and energy of
free wills and free markets.
   A new world of freedom lays before us. Hopeful. Confident. A
world where peace endures, where commerce has conscience, and where
all that seems possible is possible.
   So, let us begin, in good faith, to set the stage for the new
millennium. And thank you for coming to Houston, and thank all who
have made us feel so at home here.
   Thank you very much.

   Two hungry black bears damaged cars and
paid an unwelcome call on a camper, prompting authorities to close
two campsites until the animals can be captured, a national forest
spokeswoman said Monday.
   The bears have been spotted in the Pemigewasset Wilderness of
the White Mountain National Forest.
   ``They've damaged some vehicles that belong to some of the
volunteers that work for the Forest Service,'' said Alexis Jackson,
a spokeswoman for the White Mountain National Forest. On Sunday
night, ``they entered a tent that a woman was sleeping in.''
   Jackson said the female camper was not injured. She did not have
the woman's name and said a report had not been filed yet.
   ``I don't know if she had food in the tent with her, or just had
clothes on that she wore when she cooked,'' Jackson said.
   The smell of food doesn't have to be very strong to attract
bears. ``They have a very sensitive sense of smell,'' she said.
   The damaged vehicles were at parking lots up to five miles from
the campsites.
   Jackson said Forest Service employees placed traps to catch the
animals so they can be moved to a more remote area.
   No one has gotten a good look at the bears because they have
turned up mainly at night, but both are fairly large, she said.
   ``We see a lot of bear up in there, but they don't normally
bother people,'' she said. ``Black bear are kind of reclusive and
they don't usually bother people.''
   The last time Jackson said she could determine that bears had
bothered campers and hikers in the national forest was in 1980,
when bears also began raiding campsites for food. She said she has
not found any record of anyone being killed by a black bear in New
Hampshire.

   The Supreme Court said Monday it would not
free a Texas television reporter serving a six-month jail term for
refusing to reveal the name of a confidential source.
   The justices, by a 7-2 vote, rejected an emergency request by
reporter Brian Karem of KMOL-TV in San Antonio.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall voted to grant
Karem's request that he be freed pending his appeal of the judge's
contempt order that led to his jailing.
   Karem was jailed June 27 after refusing to disclose the identity
of a source who helped arrange his telephone interview last year
with jailed murder suspect Henry Hernandez.
   Hernandez is charged with fatally shooting San Antonio Police
Officer Gary Williams in March 1989.
   Attorneys in the murder trial of Hernandez and his brother,
Julian, have said they need to know who arranged the interview to
assure a fair trial and determine whether the interview should be
admitted as evidence.
   Henry Hernandez said in the interview that he shot the officer
in self-defense.
   Sheriff Harlow Copeland of Bexar County, Texas, said last week
that he tracked down the source who helped Karem and identified the
individual as Hernandez's cousin.
   Karem has refused to say whether the cousin was the source.
   Supreme Court Justice Byron R. White on June 28 denied an
earlier bid by Karem to be freed. Karem renewed his request by
asking Brennan for help, and Brennan referred the matter to the
full court.
   Meanwhile, the Society of Professional Journalists called Sunday
for Karem's immediate release and commended the reporter and his
station ``for their dedication and willingness to stand by the
principles in which we believe even in the face of such adversity
and at the cost of such high personal sacrifice.''

   The KGB chief said Monday that eight Soviet
intelligence agents have defected to the West since 1979 and a spy
from an unidentified foreign power was arrested in the past three
weeks.
   Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, answering questions from delegates to the
28th Congress of the Communist Party, denied accusations by a
former KGB general that the agency was ineffective in its
counterintelligence and intelligence operations and had spied on
Soviet citizens.
   ``All these are bald-faced lies,'' said Kryuchkov, who as a
member of the Politburo was required by the congress to account for
his activities and answer questions.
   Former KGB Maj. Gen. Oleg D. Kalugin has caused a sensation in
the Soviet media since he surfaced last month, accusing the KGB of
spying on the leaders of strike committees and emerging political
groups, of running weak counterintelligence operations, and of
having spy rings around the world blown through the defections of
key agents.
   Kryuchkov defended the government for stripping Kalugin of his
rank of major general and all of his service awards. The order was
signed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has not
commented publicly on the issue.
   Kryuchkov said the ``Committee for State Security (KGB) ...
acknowledges that failures and errors in personnel selection that
sometimes cause severe losses.''
   But, he said, ``in the last 11 years, eight of our agents have
gone into the service of the West, not 20 as Kalugin claims.''
   Kryuchkov also said that ``about three weeks ago, another
foreign intelligence agent was arrested. We did not report that. An
investigation is under way, whose results will be communicated to
the public.''
   He also cited the arrest of two other alleged spies, A.
Tolkachev, who worked in a sensitive military field, and a man
named Polyakov, who he said spied for 25 years.
   The KGB has been waging a propaganda campaign against Kalugin,
and Kryuchkov carried it into the Kremlin Palace of Congresses,
where the Communist congress was meeting.
   ``Delegates asked me to talk about about Kalugin,'' Kryuchkov
said. ``He was accepted into the service of the KGB in 1952, with
the help of his father, a career officer in the NKVD,'' a
forerunner of the KGB.
   ``Kalugin's career started to take off in the 1970s. In 1970 he
became chief of internal counterintelligence, and quickly attained
the rank of general. When Kalugin climbed the service staircase, he
said nothing critical about the organs of state security or our
political system,'' said Kryuchkov.
   ``But a complex situation involving him arose in 1979. The
leadership of the Committee on State Security was forced to make a
decision that he could no longer work in intelligence,'' he said.
   He did not give particulars, but said that ``as a result of his
incompetence and breaches of discipline, we lost a valuable source
of information.''
   Kalugin was transferred to Leningrad, but ran afoul of
authorities there, too, and was retired at age 55, said the KGB
chief.
   On retirement, ``Kalugin tried to bargain with the leaders of
the KGB, and threatened to turn to the press,'' but the KGB
refused, Kryuchkov said.
   ``And Kalugin soon started to carry out his threats. On June 14,
he gave a speech on Radio Liberty,'' the U.S.-government funded
radio station broadcasting to the Soviet Union from West Germany.
   ``He waged a steady campaign against the organs of state
security, in interviews with the Soviet and foreign press, in
speeches and on television. He presented the KGB as an all-powerful
monster, an organization of penetrating all spheres of society,''
Kryuchkov said.
   ``The KGB was said to be putting the brakes on the reform and
democratization of the country ... Kalugin portrayed the majority
of contemporary Chekists (KGB officers) as open Stalinists,''
Kryuchkov said.
   He denied all of Kalugin's allegations.

   Engineers at Rockwell International in
California may have located the source of a mysterious hydrogen
leak that grounded the space shuttle fleet, officials said today.
   NASA spokesman Kyle Herring at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston said that tests on Sunday found hydrogen pouring from
plumbing attachments that had been removed from space shuttle
Columbia.
   It was not immediately clear now long it would take to fix the
leak and resume flights with the three-vehicle space shuttle fleet.
   William Lenoir, associate administrator for space flight at
NASA, said investigators found ``a significant leak,'' but said
they don't know which seal, valve or pipe in the maze of tubes is
specifically leaking. ``We haven't eliminated any suspects,'' he
said.
   Lenoir said engineers are looking hardest at a U-shaped, Teflon
seal that prevents leakage at a joint where the external tank is
jettisoned from the shuttle during launch.
   Herring said, ``How big the leak rate is, they don't know yet.''
   ``They did get some sort of leak. It's on the orbiter side,'' he
said. The winged spacecraft that carries the astronauts is called
the orbiter.
   Rockwell was testing an apparatus called the umbilical. This is
a group of pipes and valves that link the orbiter with the external
tank, the large orange tank that holds the rocket propellant for
the shuttle's main rocket engines during launch.
   NASA discovered a leak somewhere in the umbilical plumbing in
May when Columbia's external tank was being loaded with rocket
propellant. The source of the leak could not be found and NASA
rolled Columbia back to the hanger and dismantled the umbilical. It
was sent to Rockwell for testing.
   Engineers found a leak on space shuttle Atlantis that was
similar to the one on Columbia. NASA space flight chief William
Lenoir ordered the space shuttle fleet grounded until the source of
the leak could be found and fixed.
   Lenoir said Friday that the Rockwell test was a key move toward
correction of the leak.
   He said a leak test is now planned for late this week on
Atlantis, which is still sitting on a launch pad at the Kennedy
Space Center.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing
Cabinet easily survived its first test of no confidence on Monday
when Parliament rejected five motions over a housing shortage and
new Jewish settler guard units in the occupied lands.
   A close vote had been anticipated in the 120-member Knesset,
where a coalition headed by Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc has a
narrow majority of 62 seats. The opposition has a total of 58
seats, including 38 held by Likud's major rival, the center-left
Labor Party.
   But following a five-hour debate, the five motions of no
confidence were defeated, 60 to 51. Five legislators put themselves
on record as abstaining and four did not vote.
   One left-wing legislator, Avraham Poraz of the Shinui Party,
decided not to vote to cancel out the absence of Sara Doron of
Likud, who was hospitalized after heart surgery.
   Poraz told Israel radio he acted on ``moral grounds'' after
hearing Likud was considering taking Doron by ambulance to vote if
a majority was not assured.
   Two other legislators also did not vote.
   The motions against Shamir were filed by five left-wing parties
and won support from the Labor Party, headed by former Prime
Minister Shimon Peres.
   It was the first threat to Shamir's coalition, made up of 10
religious and ultra-nationalist parties, since it was installed
June 11 at the end of a three-month political crisis.
   The political crisis began March 15, when Labor toppled a joint
coalition with Likud in a parliamentary vote of no confidence as a
protest against Shamir's opposition to U.S. proposals for
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
   Monday's motions focused on a housing shortage at a time when
thousands of Soviets are emigrating to Israel. In the past month,
hundreds of homeless Israelis have pitched tents in public parks
around the country to dramatize the issue.
   Also on the agenda were motions against the government's recent
decision to set up civil guard units in the occupied West Bank. The
government earlier announced approval of two units, but revealed
Monday that five were actually approved.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens told Parliament the Jewish settlers
in the occupied lands deserved the same protection as all the
citizens of the state.
   But critics fear these units could spur further Jewish vigilante
attacks on Arabs and exacerbate the 31-month-old Palestinian
uprising against Israel in the occupied lands.

   Israeli warplanes blasted bases of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah for a second day Monday, killing 12 people
and raising fears the violence might thwart the anticipated release
of a Western hostage.
   Police said eight civilians and four combatants of Hezbollah, or
Party of God, were killed. Twenty-eight others, including 10
fighters, were wounded, they said.
   A police spokesman said four U.S.-built F-4 Phantom fighter
bombers mounted two bombing runs, 10 minutes apart, on Loweizeh and
Melita in southern Lebanon.
   Palls of black smoke hung over the stricken targets in Iqlim
al-Tuffah, or the Apple region, overlooking Israel's
self-designated ``security zone,'' the spokesman said.
   The attacks came a day after Israeli jets had flattened a
Hezbollah base two miles to the south. Three fighters were killed
and 12 wounded in Sunday's raid.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli military command said its warplanes
struck targets used by Hezbollah for ``organizing and launching
attacks'' and returned safely. It did not elaborate.
   Later Monday, Israeli artillerymen in the security zone traded
heavy artillery fire with Hezbollah positions north of the buffer,
police and U.N. sources said.
   A U.N. source said at that one point, the international
peacekeepers monitored a barrage of 12 Katyusha rockets fired by
Hezbollah into the security zone, which Israel established in 1985.
The source spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Voice of the South, the radio of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army militia, said three people were killed and five
wounded in the barrage.
   Monday's air attack was Israel's third in four days and 15th
this year. In 14 previous raids, 19 people were killed and 51
wounded.
   The sudden escalation of violence coincided with reports that a
Western hostage, most probably a European, would soon be freed by
Moslem captors.
   ``Let us pray the Israeli attacks will not scuttle efforts to
free one of the hostages,'' said a Shiite source close to
Hezbollah's Iranian-backed leadership.
   ``The hostage-holders are definitely restless, but I personally
believe Iran's pressure will probably override the impact of the
attacks,'' he said on condition of anonymity.
   Danny Neveh, spokesman for Defense Minister Moshe Arens,
rejected any links between the raids and hostages and said the
timing of the air strikes was ``based only on our operating policy
against terrorism.''
   An Israeli government source said the timing of the latest raids
might look unfortunate, but could be the result of a lack of
coordination between the military and political echelons in Israel.
He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the United States views the attacks ``as part of the cycle of
violence which harms all the parties in the region.''
   ``We are against all acts of violence committed by different
groups in southern Lebanon,'' he said.
   Shiite fundamentalists accuse Western governments of favoring
Israel and hold them responsible for its actions against Arabs.
   A Shiite source, who requested anonymity, said Tehran was
pushing hard for the release of a hostage in appreciation for aid
it received after the June 21 killer earthquake there.
   He would not speculate on the identity of the hostage, despite
expectations in Beirut, London and Dublin that it would probably be
Irish educator Brian Keenan.
   The Irish Red Cross flew the first Western relief plane into
Tehran after the earthquake, in which 40,000 people were killed.
   The hostages are six Americans, four Britons, two West Germans,
two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   A source close to the Syrian command in Moslem west Beirut said
Sunday he did not expect a hostage to be freed before the middle of
the week.
   Syria, Lebanon's main power broker, has 40,000 troops in control
of 70 percent of Lebanon's territory under a 1976 Arab League
mandate to snuff out the civil war, now in its 16th year.
   The Syrians were instrumental in the release of American
hostages Robert Polhill on April 22 and Frank Reed on April 30.

   The British rock group Pink Floyd is planning
to stage an $8 million concert extravaganza based on its album
``The Wall'' in Berlin, where else, next to the Wall.
   The performance, set for July 21 at Patzdamer Platz near the
site of the Brandenburg Gate, will feature the construction and
demolition of a 80-foot-tall, 600-foot-long wall.
   The concert will launch a five-year campaign to raise $800
million for the Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief, said founding
member Roger Waters.
   ``I want Russians, Germans, Americans building the wall and
tearing it down, as a symbolic act of collaboration and the aims of
the Memorial Fund,'' Waters said by telephone from London.
   The group wants to get ``the armed forces freed to do disaster
relief work when they have time off from training or polishing
their boots,'' Waters said.
   The movie version of ``The Wall,'' a story of a troubled rock
star, was released in 1979 and is based on the band's album. Some
19 million albums were sold worldwide.
   Due to join Waters on stage in Berlin are Sinead O'Connor, Van
Morrison, Thomas Dolby, The Band, Bryan Adams, The Scorpions, the
East Berlin Rundfunk Symphony Orchestra, and the East Berlin Radio
Choir.

   Rays of sun powered wheels of
thunder on 31 exotically styled cars that hit the road Monday in a
1,600-mile race.
   The shiny, low-slung vehicles caused many doubletakes among
motorists along U.S. 192 shortly after leaving their starting point
at Walt Disney World.
   All of the automobiles for the 11-day GM Sunrayce USA were
designed and built by college engineering students from the United
States and Canada at costs ranging from about $30,000 to more than
$1 million.
   The cars are powered strictly by the sun and solar-energy
storage batteries.
   The winner will have the lowest elapsed time over secondary
roads in eight states. The race is in daily stages, with each car
starting at the same point each day. It ends July 19 at the General
Motors technical center outside Detroit.
   GM President Bob Stempel said he hoped the race would serve as
an incentive for young people to study science and engineering.
   Among the entries was a pontoonlike auto with two drivers in
fishbowl-shaped cockpits facing in opposite directions. That one's
from Western Washington University.
   The ``Sunshine Special'' from Florida Institute of Technology
features wraparound solar cells, including the bottom of the car to
catch sunlight reflected off the road.
   ``Midnight Sun'' from the University of Waterloo-Ontario,
Canada, looks like a flying saucer gliding down the highway, and
the University of Texas reportedly spent more than $1 million on
its 340-pound dynamo made out of carbon graphite.
   Many of the entrants and officials were talking about the unique
solar array on the bottom of Florida's car, which Professor Bill
Thrasher said was ``a closely guarded secret'' for almost two years.
   Thrasher said tests showed that the reflected solar energy was
about one-third as much as that captured from the top of the car.
   The entry cost $225,000 to build. The governor's energy office
contributed $95,000, the rest came from about 40 sponsors.
   The auto from Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a squat,
buglike affair with only the driver's head showing. It cost only
$30,000 to build, said MIT driver Thomas Massie.
   Tuesday's leg from Floral City will end in Tallahassee, 192
miles away by the planned rural route. Wednesday, the drivers hope
the cars will run 205 miles from Tallahassee to Montgomery, Ala.,
via Georgia.
   The race is sponsored by GM, the U.S. Department of Energy and
the Society of Automotive Engineers. GM and the Energy Department
provided each school with $7,000 in seed money to start their
projects last year.
   The top two finishers and a third selected for technological
innovation will be sent by GM to compete in the 1990 World Solar
Challenge in Australia.
   ``We want to encourage students to pursue science and
engineering in the future,'' said Stempel.
   The other states along the route are Tennessee, Kentucky,
Indiana and Ohio.

<HEAD>Rebel Assault Slows in Liberia; Gov't Troops Roam Capital</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The rebel assault on the capital
appeared to have slowed Monday and government troops roamed the
city, reportedly killing suspected insurgents.
   Automatic and semi-automatic gunfire and rockets echoed through
the eastern suburb of Paynesville, eight miles from the city
center. Rebels have said they are fighting there from house to
house.
   It was not immediately clear what caused the rebel advance to
slow.
   On Monday, the rebel radio station was reported to have said
insurgents accepted a cease-fire proposed last week by President
Samuel Doe. The radio said a rebel delegation would attend peace
talks in Freetown, Sierra Leone aimed at ending the six-month
tribal war. The talks were scheduled to begin Tuesday.
   But in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, chief rebel spokesman Tom Woewiyu
said Sunday the rebels rejected a truce, and were sticking to their
demand that Doe leave Liberia before fighting could stop.
   There have also been reports of infighting among rebel comanders.
   The rebels invaded from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24 to overthrow
Doe's government. They accuse Doe of corruption, tribalism and
brutal suppression of opposition.
   Hundreds of civilians have been killed in the past week since
rebels attacked the outskirts of the Liberian capital in an attempt
to end Doe's 10-year rule.
   On Monday, three soldiers drove a man to the Monrovia's Atlantic
Ocean shore, ordered him out of the car and shouted: ``Go to the
beach.'' The man imploringly waved his identity papers.
   All three then pumped bullets into his head, back and legs from
their U.S.-supplied M-16 automatic rifles just outside the front
gate of the home of Dennis Jett, second-in-command at the U.S.
Embassy.
   The soldiers told reporters who watched: ``This man is a rebel.''
   The troops said they believed the man was a rebel because he
said he was going to buy rice but had only $1.15 in his pocket. A
cup of rice now costs $2.
   Doe's troops have been accused of killing hundreds of members of
the Gio and Mano tribes, who support the rebels. The rebels have
retaliated by killing members of the Krahn and Mandingo people, who
back the government.
   Monrovia has been without water, electricity and fresh food for
more than a week and food prices have soared. Monrovians lined up
for hours outside a handful of supermarkets under army guard on
Monday.
   Shopkeepers, fearful of soldiers who have been looting stores,
opened only because Doe ordered them to in a Sunday broadcast. Doe
also asked government workers to return to work, but most offices
and shops remained closed.
   The broadcast was made from a makeshift radio in his executive
mansion, protected by a presidential guard.
   The national bank, which was robbed by soldiers of about $2.5
million last week opened Monday to pay civil servants their wages.
   Thousands of Liberians have fled the country over the past two
months.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the U.S. was arranging charter flights for a half-dozen Americans
who asked for help leaving Liberia. The embassy has already
evacuated most Americans from the country.
   In Monrovia's port, soldiers stole 50 Romanian Dacia jeeps from
a ship which they had forced to berth Sunday. Doe had ordered one
of his few remaining vessels to intercept the Rupea, shipping
sources said without giving details.
   Doe seized power in a bloody 1980 coup that ousted elitist
descendants of American slaves who founded this country in 1847.

<HEAD>Soviet Union Will Cut Its Oil Exports</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union, facing a lack of fuel for
domestic use, will cut its oil exports by 140,000 barrels a day,
according to Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
   The Soviet Union is the world's largest oil producer, although
production levels have been declining. The U.S. government
estimated 1989 total Soviet oil output at 12.14 million barrels per
day.
   Production has fallen because of the cost of maintaining output
as well as ethnic unrest in oil producing regions such as
Azerbaijan.
   Ryzhkov said the government decided in late June to cut its oil
exports by 7 million metric tons, or 140,000 barrels a day.
   The cut in exports would apply to socialist bloc countries as
well as Western nations, he said Saturday, answering questions by
delegates to the 28th Communist Party Congress on the upcoming
Soviet harvest.
   ``This will permit us to supply our agriculture,'' Ryzhkov said,
adding that otherwise, fuel shortages would hurt the harvest.

   As the summit leaders focus on global issues,
their spouses have a full schedule of sightseeing and socializing,
starting with a private dinner at friends of President Bush's
Monday night.
   The seven leaders of the industrialized world planned a working
dinner Monday at Bayou Bend, a mansion-turned-museum, while they
spouses were guests of Betty and Hugh Liedtkes.
   The Liedtkes, close friends of both Bush and his wife, Barbara,
invited the spouses to their home for dinner in the upscale
Memorial neighborhood. Liedtke is a wealthy oil man who knew Bush
when the president was in the oil business in Texas before entering
politics.
   On Tuesday, the spouses planned to fly to San Antonio to tour
the Alamo, the Mission San Jose and the renovated Majestic Theatre.
San Antonio also was in the running to host the economic summit,
but the city lost out to Houston, Bush's adopted hometown. .
   The Alamo is the site of the historic 1836 battle between the
Mexican army and a group of men led by Col. William Travis who were
fighting for Texas' independence from Mexico.
   Mexican Gen. Santa Anna's troops greatly outnumbered the Alamo
forces, although historical records do not provide an exact number.
The Mexican soldiers laid siege on the Alamo for 14 days before
attacking.
   All of Travis' men _ 189 _ were killed, and the tragic fight
gave birth to the battle cry, ``Remember the Alamo!'' for other
Texans fighting for freedom.
   After visiting San Antonio, the spouses were to return to
Houston. They also planned to tour the Texas Medical Center on
Wednesday, the final day of the summit.
   Besides Mrs. Bush, the spouses include France's Danielle
Mitterrand, Canada's Mila Mulroney, Italy's Livia Andreotti,
Japan's Sachiyo Kaifu and England's Denis Thatcher, the only male
spouse.
   Hannelore Kohl, wife of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and
Marie Delors, wife of European Commission President Jacques Delors
did not accompany their husbands to Texas.
   The wives of several other local leaders also planned to attend
Monday night's dinner at the Liedtke home. The menu included quail,
gazpacho soup, shrimp creole remoulade, poached snapper and
asparagus. Dessert was called strawberries summit.
   After dinner, the group was to be entertained by a string trio
and a singing duo. The trio's members are all teen-agers.
   Bush and Liedtke met years ago in West Texas while both were in
the oil business, and they helped form Zapata Petroleum.
Eventually, the company's investors spilt, although Liedtke and
Bush remained friends.
   Liedtke is the former chief of Houston-based Pennzoil Co., the
oil company that won an $10.3 billion judgment in 1985 from Texaco
Inc. over Texaco's takeover of Getty Oil Co. Pennzoil later settled
for $3 billion.
   Liedtke is still chairman of Pennzoil's board.

   Character actor Howard Duff, who
played tough detective Sam Spade on radio in the 1940s and Sheriff
Titus Semple on TV's ``Flamingo Road'' in the 1980s, has died. He
was 76.
   Duff died Sunday night at his home, said Judy Duff, his wife of
17 years. She said authorities believe her husband suffered a heart
attack.
   Duff had taken part in a telethon Saturday night to raise money
for victims of last month's devastating Santa Barbara fire, which
left hundreds homeless.
   He was a regular on such hit television series of the 1950s and
'60s as ``Mr. Adams and Eve,'' ``Dante'' and ``Felony Squad'' and
appeared in many movies, including ``Kramer vs. Kramer,'' ``The
Late Show'' and ``The Wedding.''
   In recent years, he was a guest on such shows as ``The Golden
Girls,'' ``Midnight Caller'' and ``Knot's Landing.''
   In addition to his wife, survivors include a daughter, Bridget,
and a brother, Doug.
   Mrs. Duff said a memorial service will be held at a later date
in Los Angeles.

   Restaurant and gourmet shop purveyors savored
caviar soup, cactus salsa and other eccentric vittles Monday at a
19,000-course meal: the international fancy-food trade show.
   ``It adds a prickly flavor,'' W. Park Kerr, president of the El
Paso Chile Co., said of his salsa, which features cactus leaves
that were harvested ``very, very carefully,'' then dethorned with a
vegetable peeler.
   Kerr was among about 1,250 vendors who eagerly angled their
estimated 19,000 products at the Fancy Food &amp; Confection Show in
the Javits convention center. Their customers, thousands of
industry buyers, milled around _ munching, networking and sipping
wine from shot-glass-size plastic cups.
   Show-goers were plied with olives, espresso and wild-rice
muffins; Belgian waffles, turkey sausage and espresso. Crackers
were topped with cheese, or dipped in sauces and jams. Bags of
``all-natural'' potato chips beckoned.
   One woman, wearing shocking-pink roller skates and matching
miniskirt, circulated with a tray of scones. An array of cake,
cookies and chocolates made for a dieter's dream _ or nightmare.
   Tom and Sally Fegley of Brattleboro, Vt., hawked ``Cow Pies.''
The chocolate patties, with labels bearing animal cartoons, are
sold in Washington, D.C., as ``Donkey Pies''; in New Jersey as
``Road Apples''; in Maine as ``Moose Pies'' and _ well, you get the
picture.
   ``Ham I Am,'' a company from Plano, Texas, offered Hogwash, a
sweet-pungent sauce, sampled with cubes of peppered ham. Company
founder Sharon Meehan, mother of four, invented Hogwash in her
kitchen; now it's sold by Nieman-Marcus and elsewhere for about $5
a jar.
   Bewley Irish Imports suggested topping toast with orange-whiskey
marmalade. ``It does give you a little nip, but you don't get a
buzz at breakfast, unless maybe you eat the whole jar,'' advised
assistant manager Chris Hausler.
   The Hansen Caviar Company Inc. had a chef whip up a little
chilled beluga caviar soup. The recipe calls for one-half pound
ripe tomatoes, 1 cucumber, 2 onions. ... Actually, with 14 ounces
of Hansen-Sturm Russian Beluga retailing for up to $750, do
inquiring minds really want to know?
   Ron Tanner, spokesman for the National Association for the
Specialty Food Trade Inc., said he'd noticed more health-oriented
products, such as low-cholesterol cheeses and sugar-free jams and
cookies, aimed at the general market this year.
   But Tanner said that doesn't necessarily indicate a trimming
trend. Instead, he said, Americans seem to be devouring the
decadent stuff _ then assuaging their guilt with diet foods.
   There was opportunity for both at the convention center. At the
show, which continues through Wednesday, even the strong
capitulated at the sight and aroma of food, food, food.
   In their midst was a courageous model of self-control: James
Gilbert, salesman for Bel Canto Fancy Foods, whose salmon-pesto
mousse was unveiled late Monday as the association's 1990 winner in
the meat, pate and game category.
   ``This is my lunch,'' said Gilbert, downing a Slim Fast diet bar
between sales pitches.

   Orphanages in Nicaragua will receive kits for
eye examinations for children and supplies to help grow vegetables
as part of a $1.4 million grant announced Monday by the Agency for
International Development.
   The grant was made to Partners of the Americas, a private
voluntary association that works through state chapters to provide
humanitarian and developmental assistance to Latin America. The
group's Wisconsin affiliate will carry out the Nicaraguan program.
   AID said the grant will provide medical, psychological and
nutritional care to orphans, whose country has been battered by
almost a decade of war between the former Sandinista regime and the
disbanded U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   It will also strengthen hospitals, clinics and other
institutions, the agency said.
   ``This grant represents one of many U.S. activities recently
initiated in Nicaragua and is an example of our desire to assist
the Nicaraguan people in rebuilding their lives,'' said James H.
Michel, assistant AID administrator for Latin America.
   AID has also initiated three grants totaling $4 million to
provide health assistance for victims of the civil strife and
designated $2.5 million for emergency medical supplies, Michel said.
   The money will be used to train health care professionals and
procure medicine, vitamins, food and recreational equipment for 15
orphanages, he said.
   Each orphanage will receive supplies for a self-help project to
grow vegetables to improve the children's diets. The grant will
also provide eye examination kits for the children. The Wisconsin
Lions Clubs will donate eyeglasses for children with vision
problems.

<HEAD>Report: Investigators Delayed Probe of FBI Agent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two weeks after a pregnant FBI informant
was slain last year, state police had evidence that a federal agent
was her lover and may have played a role in her disappearance,
according to a published report.
   But eight months went by before investigators focused their
probe on former FBI special agent Mark Putnam. He confessed last
month to strangling Ms. Smith on June 8, 1989, during a dispute
over her expected child.
   Some outside law enforcement experts said police erred by not
making Putnam the prime suspect earlier, the Lexington
Herald-Leader reported Sunday.
   In a controversial plea agreement the day he was indicted,
Putnam pleaded guilty on June 12 to manslaughter. He immediately
received a 16-year prison sentence. Ms. Smith's family, outraged at
the deal, wanted him to stand trial for murder.
   John Paul Runyon, the commonwealth's attorney in eastern
Kentucky's Pike County, said last month that without Putnam's
confession, ``we had absolutely no evidence'' to prosecute the
former agent.
   Afterward, the Herald-Leader reviewed the state police case
file, interviewed investigators and witnesses, and asked several
law enforcement experts to examine the file and evaluate the
investigation.
   The newspaper concluded that authorities ``might have been able
to build a case against Putnam if they had reacted promptly to
information that pointed to him.''
   Two weeks after Ms. Smith disappeared on June 8, 1989, police
knew she may have been pregnant by Putnam, the newspaper reported.
   Police also knew Putnam threatened her before when she discussed
the pregnancy. And Ms. Smith was expecting Putnam to pick her up at
a hotel the day she disappeared, according to the newspaper.
   Further, Putnam and his partner, special agent Ron Poole, were
giving contradictory accounts of why Smith was at the motel, the
newspaper said.
   ``There was plenty of physical evidence that they could have
developed,'' said Anthony V. Bouza, a former police chief of
Minneapolis.
   Police did no laboratory examination of the motel room where Ms.
Smith and Putnam stayed the night before her death or of the
belongings she left there, Bouza said. And they didn't quickly
locate the rental car Putnam was driving when he killed Ms. Smith.
   State police Detective Richard Ray, the lead investigator,
acknowledged it was ``kind of awkward to investigate'' an FBI agent.
   ``But I tried to think of everything,'' he added. ``I did
suspect from the start that something could have happened.
Something very bad.''
   State police Capt. Gary Rose said authorities wanted to
eliminate stronger suspects, including Ms. Smith's estranged
husband, before pursuing Putnam.
   Detectives were not even convinced Ms. Smith was dead until last
Christmas, when she didn't contact her two children, police said.
   The agent was questioned June 20, 1989, and offered to take a
lie detector test, Rose said. Putnam became the prime suspect in
February when he refused to take a polygraph.
   George Parry, a former head of special investigations for the
Philadelphia district attorney and a former federal organized crime
prosecutor, said state police made a sincere effort. But Parry said
the FBI should not have allowed the suspect's partner, Poole, to
investigate Smith's disappearance.
   The FBI has declined requests from The Associated Press and the
Lexington newspaper to interview Poole.

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia has signed an agreement to
purchase 315 of the Army's most advanced tanks in a deal worth more
than $3 billion, the Pentagon announced Monday.
   The M-1A2 tank, the most up-to-date version of the Abrams, the
Army's main battle tank, is manufactured by the Lands Systems
Division of General Dynamics Corp.
   The tanks are scheduled for delivery from 1993 through 1995.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, citing lessening chances for U.S.
involvement in a major European land war, had proposed terminating
the M-1 tank program in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   The Saudi deal means that the nation's tank production lines, at
plants in Lima, Ohio, and Warren, Mich., will not be shutting down.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., applauded the arrangement as ``good
news for Michigan and for the nation.''
   Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, said the Saudi order alone isn't
enough to prevent scheduled cutbacks at the two plants, but will
enable the United States to offer lower prices for tank sales to
other countries.
   The $3 billion agreement includes support equipment, spare
parts, training, munitions and the construction of maintenance
facilities, the Pentagon said in a statement.
   The M-1A2 version is outfitted with a 120mm gun and toughened
armor to protect it against Soviet-produced antitank weapons
systems.
   It also features special viewers for the gunner and tank
commander that will allow each to seek out targets in the dark.
   The systems are separate from one another, enabling the gunner
to shoot at one target while the commander seeks out the next one.
   Congress was told last year that the deal was pending. Bush
administration officials have said that United States would ensure
that Israel maintains a qualitative edge over Arab armed forces.
   Oxley said the Saudis wanted to tanks to patrol their border
with Iraq.

<HEAD>Consumer Borrowing Increases in May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Americans took out $3.9 billion more in
consumer credit than they paid off in May, 10 times the amount
incurred only a month earlier, the government said Monday.
   The Federal Reserve said consumer credit increased at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.5 percent, up from the
previous month's 0.6 percent growth rate. Net new debt in April
totaled $390 million.
   It was the highest annual rate of increase since a 7.5 percent
rate in October when Americans borrowed $4.4 billion more than they
paid off.
   The May increase was concentrated in credit card debt, which
rose $3.1 billion, or an annual rate of 18.5 percent.
   Consumers, who account for about two-thirds of U.S. economic
activity, had appeared to be more cautious in their borrowing and
spending in recent months.
   Analysts had attributed the slower pace to high interest rates,
waning confidence because of adverse economic news and to the high
level of debt already held by many Americans.
   The annualized rate of credit growth for the first five months
of 1990 was 3 percent, down from the 7.6 percent for all of 1989
and 8.5 percent for 1988.
   At the same time, Americans' savings rate _ savings as a
percentage of disposable income _ has been pegged above 6 percent
for several months after dropping to a low of 3.2 percent for all
of 1987.
   Gilbert Benz, an economist with Swiss Bank Corp. in New York,
said varying methods of computing economic statistics are used by
different government agencies and occasionally produce different
results.
   The Commerce Department's retail sales reports, which have
fallen for three consecutive months, don't include services such as
health care and have a smaller survey sample than the Fed's
consumer credit reports, Benz said.
   Benz also said that April borrowing was weak and that the May
borrowing was ``somewhat of a payback.''
   ``Consumers are not dying,'' Benz said. ``Perhaps they're a
little more cautious, definitely slowing, but by no means do we
have a recession scenario.''
   Automobile loans continued to decline in May, but at a slower
rate. Debt dropped $87 million, a 0.4 percent rate of decline. That
compared with a net decline in automobile debt of $2 billion the
previous month.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose $533
million, a 3.1 percent annual rate after a 4 percent annual growth
rate in April.
   Borrowing for mobile homes increased $325 million, a 17.2
percent annual rate of growth after a 0.3 percent decline the
previous month.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at the end of May
at $724.7 billion.

<HEAD>Bishop Testifies He Supports Homosexual Ministers _ If They Don't
Have Sex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lutheran bishop who filed charges
against two churches for hiring homosexual ministers says he
supports parishes led by gays and lesbians as long as the preachers
do not engage in homosexual sex.
   ``I found it necessary to file charges because the congregations
had violated the (church's) constitution on a very serious
matter,'' said Lyle Miller, bishop of Sierra Pacific Synod, the
regional judiciary branch of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America.
   A 14-member church discipline committee was set to begin
deliberations Tuesday after three days of meetings on whether to
expel two San Francisco churches, St. Francis Lutheran and First
United Lutheran, for ordaining a gay man and a lesbian couple who
refused to take vows of celibacy.
   The panel is expected to issue a decision by July 17.
   Miller in 1989 refused to recommend Jeff Johnson, an openly gay
man, for an ordained ministry because Johnson would not vow
abstinence from homosexual relations.
   But the First United Lutheran Church hired Johnson as an
assistant pastor in 1989. Two months later, St. Francis Lutheran
ignored church guidelines and hired two lesbian pastors who also
refused to pledge celibacy.
   The Evangelical Lutheran Church, with 5.3 million members, is
the largest Lutheran body in the United States. Like other
mainstream churches, it forbids ordination of sexually active
homosexuals, arguing that sex should only be practiced within
marriage.

Study Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Out-of-pocket health expenses are taking the
same size bite out of Americans' incomes as they were in the early
1970s, and even less than in 1960, according to a team of
government researchers.
   Over the past three decades, as health costs have climbed, the
government and employers have shared most of the increased costs,
the Health Care Financing Administration researchers reported.
   Private insurance has been providing more benefits, largely
because states are requiring more coverage, but employers have been
unsuccessful in shifting the costs of better coverage to workers,
said economist Katharine R. Levit.
   However, she predicts that will change.
   ``Businesses are essentially being squeezed (by medical costs)
on the employer side and by competition on the price side,'' she
said. ``Some reconciliation of the problem is going to have to
occur.''
   But while many business leaders and some politicians have been
calling for changes in the nation's health care system, ``we as
individuals don't feel the pressure yet,'' Levit said. ``And until
we do, we won't join the ranks of business and government'' in
clamoring for changes.
   In 1988, spending from all sources for health care in the United
States was nearly $540 billion _ more than 11 percent of the gross
national product that year, Levit and two colleagues reported in an
article published in the summer issue of Health Affairs, a
quarterly journal on health policy.
   The figures tallied by Levit, Mark Freeland and Dan Waldo are
the latest comprehensive figures available, they said.
   National health expenditures have grown at an average annual
rate of 11 percent over the past three decades, and 10.4 percent
from 1987 to 1988.
   Americans used about 5 percent of their after-tax income in 1988
on health care expenses _ including their share of insurance
premiums and out-of-pocket costs to meet deductibles and pay for
medical care not covered by insurance.
   This proportion is the same as in 1972-73 and lower than the 6.1
percent of after-tax income used for health care expenses in
1960-61, the researchers reported.
   Since 1964-65, health spending has grown from 4.2 percent of all
federal expenditures to nearly 14 percent in 1987, Levit said. For
state and local expenditures combined, health spending has grown
from 7.4 percent to 13 percent over the same period, she said.
   Businesses have seen their share of health insurance premiums
increase from 2 percent of total employer compensation in 1965 to 6
percent in 1987, Levit said.

<HEAD>Two Widows Divide Estate of Husband They Shared</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNISTON, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two women have agreed to divide the $10
million estate of a husband they unknowingly shared for more almost
three decades, according to court documents.
   The estate of Harry Glenn Davis, a Calhoun County landowner,
included cash, rental property and real estate in Calhoun and
Talladega counties, according to 1989 documents unsealed last week
at the request of a local newspaper.
   Davis was married to Ruth Davis and Flossie Davis for 28 years
but neither wife knew of the other until after his death in 1988.
   Ruth lived on the couple's Boiling Springs farm near Oxford, in
northeast Alabama, while Flossie, one of Davis' former tenants,
lived in Tallahassee, Fla.
   Davis commuted between the two sites, telling the women he spent
weekdays ``handling his business interests'' in Calhoun County and
weekends ``gambling in New Orleans,'' according to their attorneys.
   There were no children from the 51-year marriage between Davis
and Ruth. Flossie, who was married to Davis for 28 years, had two
children: Harry Glenn Davis Jr. and Debbie Anne Davis.
   When Davis died at age 76, he apparently left only one heir,
Ruth. But a few months later, Flossie filed a 1969 will in which
Davis left most of the estate to her and their two children. It
provided $50,000 and a monthly allowance to Ruth.
   Ruth's lawyers contested the 1969 will and contended that Davis
left the estate to Ruth in a will written in 1959, prior to
Flossie's 1960 marriage.
   According to court records, Circuit Judge Harold Quattlebaum
said his opinion was that the marriage of Flossie and Davis was
null and void because Davis was legally married to Ruth at the time
of the second union.
   But the women agreed to share the estate rather than risk
getting nothing in the court battle.
   Neither received the amount they were seeking. Flossie had filed
a claim for $10 million, and each child sought $2 million. Ruth had
filed a claim for $40 million.
   In the settlement, Flossie was awarded $360,000 in cash, a
$165,000 promissory note owed to Davis by Williamson Oil Co. and
real estate appraised at more than $600,000. Her children received
$20,000 each.
   Ruth received the remainder of the estate, including several
thousand shares of stock, two checking accounts which contained
undisclosed amounts and property appraised at about $5 million.

<HEAD>3 Americans Among 10 Alleged Sect Members Jailed, 22 Kids Held</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARCELONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Monday said they had jailed 10
adults, including three Americans, and placed 22 minors under
protective custody after raiding a commune belonging to an outlawed
religious cult.
   The three U.S. citizens, six Spaniards and one Briton were
arrested Sunday when the Catalonian regional police raided two
villas near Barcelona that allegedly belonged to members of the
Children of God sect.
   A police spokesman declined to identify those jailed, but said
they were expected to appear before a Barcelona judge on Tuesday on
suspicion of kidnapping and illegal proselytizing.
   Children of God, also known as the Family of Love, was founded
in California in 1968 by an itinerant preacher named David Berg.
The group came to Europe in the early 1970s and has been criticized
by parents of members who say it relies on brainwashing and
hypnotism to woo and hold its young members.
   The police spokesman said the children, who were living with
eight of the adults in one of the villas, were being held in a
public foster care center. They included nine Spaniards and 13
others, and range in age from 11 months to 14 years, said the
spokesman, who was not identified in keeping with custom.
   The group has been declared illegal in Spain, according to Pilar
Salarruyana, former chairwoman of a parliamentary committee that
investigates sects.
   The sect has been involved in several skirmishes with the law in
Spain since the mid-1980s, authorities say.

<HEAD>Ethnic Albanians Rally in Kosovo; Provincial President Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians staged peaceful demonstrations and strikes throughout the
troubled southern province of Kosovo on Monday to protest the
near-abolition of Kosovo's autonomy.
   In the provincial capital of Pristina, 150 miles south of
Belgrade, baton-wielding security forces dispersed a crowd of about
1,000 people.
   But witnesses and the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said the vast
majority of employees of Albanian origin left their jobs in
state-run companies Monday and peacefully paraded on the streets of
Kosovo towns.
   Hisen Kajdomcaj, president of Kosovo's collective state
presidency, and two other members of the body resigned Monday to
protest last week's decision by Serbia's Communist authorities to
dissolve local governing bodies in Kosovo.
   In resigning, they described Serbia's action as ``a drastic,
unconstitutional attack on the ... province.''
   Kosovo is an administrative part of Serbia, the largest of
Yugoslavia's six republics. Serbia's move all but abolished the
autonomy Kosovo was granted under the 1974 federal constitution.
   In reply, Kosovo's ethnic Albanian opposition groups organized
the ``peaceful resistance protest.''
   ``The autonomy of the province is guaranteed by the
constitution, and cannot be jeopardized,'' they said in a joint
letter of resignation carried by Tanjug. They appealed to the
leadership of this nation of more than 23.4 million people to
``undertake immediate measures to ensure the democratic settlement
of the situation.''
   Serbian authorities disbanded the local assembly and government
after 114 ethnic Albanian members of the assembly announced plans
to declare Kosovo's full autonomy from Serbia. Both dismantled
bodies were dominated by ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent
of the province's 1.9 million people.
   On Monday, heavy security forces patrolled the streets of
Pristina, occasionally breaking up smaller groups of protesters,
witnesses said.
   At least 60 ethnic Albanians have died in clashes with security
forces since Kosovo's autonomy was limited by constitutional
changes enacted by Serbia in March 1989.
   Serbia also announced Thursday that the managers and leading
Albanian journalists of local news organizations were being
replaced. Albanian-language programs on Pristina radio and
television were taken off the air.
   The Rilindja Albanian-language newspaper was banned. Tanjug said
the daily did not appear on Monday because police impounded its
entire circulation during the night.
   Serbian authorities say ethnic Albanians seek independence and
have pressured Serbs to move out of Kosovo.
   Ethnic Albanians deny it. They want free elections and a
multiparty system, and say Serbia's Communist leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, is using the Kosovo issue to gain popular support for
his brand of orthodox single-party rule.

<TEXT>
   The nation's longest and costliest criminal
court proceeding went to a jury Monday for a second time, with a
judge telling jurors to ignore public opinion in deciding charges
against Raymond Buckey.
   ``It's been close to seven years of my life and now it's come to
a finale, McMartin Two, the summer rerun,'' Buckey told reporters
outside court, referring to the now defunct McMartin Pre-School.
``Twelve more people will decide my fate.''
   Buckey is charged with eight counts of molestation involving
three young girls who once attended the Manhattan Beach preschool
operated by his family.
   Buckey, 32, is the only one of seven teachers accused of
molesting children at the preschool still facing charges. Charges
against five of the teachers were dismissed and his mother, Peggy
McMartin Buckey, was acquitted on all counts following the first
trial.
   At the first trial, Buckey was acquitted on 40 counts of
sexually abusing children at the school. Jurors deadlocked on 13
other charges against him, however, and prosecutors refiled on
eight of those counts.
   Jurors began deliberations after Superior Court Judge Stanley
Weisberg delivered 30 minutes of instructions.
   He addressed the issue of witness credibility, focusing on how
jurors should view the unique testimony of child witnesses.
   ``You should not discount or distrust the testimony of a child,
or give it greater weight, solely because the witness is a child.''
Weisberg said.
   The retrial, which lasted just three months, followed a two-year
preliminary hearing and a nearly three-year trial. That was the
nation's longest court proceding and cost Los Angeles over $13.5
million _ a record for a criminal trial.
   Buckey took the stand in both trials to deny he ever molested
children.
   Both trials have been held in a highly charged atmosphere, and
Weisberg told jurors they must not base their decision on public
opinion about the notorious case.
   ``You must base your decision on the facts and the law,'' he
said.
   The retrial featured testimony from three young girls who said
Buckey molested them when they were students at the preschool.
   The defense alleged the children were influenced by therapists
who interviewed them in the early stages of the case, and suggested
their testimony was unreliable.
   Prosecutors said the children should be believed, although they
acknowledged that memories had faded over the years. The children
who were barely verbal when they attended the school are now 12-and
13-years-old, prosecutors noted.
   Buckey was arrested nearly seven years ago and spent five years
in jail before a judge released him on bail.
   The defendant said outside court he has not decided what to do
with the rest of his life.
   ``For a long time I didn't want to deal with society. I wanted
to go away and become a hermit. But now, people come up to me and
ask me how I got through this. Maybe I can help other people. ... I
don't know what I'll do, maybe grow Christmas trees in Oregon,
maybe give advice on how you survive a witch hunt.''
   The prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Joseph Martinez told
reporters: ``We're confident that if the jury views the testimony
of the children and considers the medical evidence and the
testimony of the parents, we feel the jury might convict. ... You
never know.''

   The Environmental Protection Agency outlined
hazardous waste cleanup procedures and standards on Monday that it
said could cost private industry as much as $42 billion to carry
out.
   EPA administrator William K. Reilly called the plan ``a
pragmatic approach for correcting existing problems'' and said it
will ensure ``to the extent practical'' prevention of releases that
might threaten human health and the environment.
   The proposed standards and procedures, affecting a wide range of
industries and federal facilities regulated under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, will be published later this month
in the Federal Register.
   The public will have 60 days from publication date to comment on
them. Public hearings have been scheduled in San Francisco and
Washington, D.C. in October.
   EPA said the new regulations would affect 3,000 to 4,000
facilities, including several hundred owned by the federal
government.
   The agency estimated it could cost privately owned facilities
between $7 billion and $42 billion to meet the requirements. The
price tag for federal facilities would total $3 billion to $18
billion, EPA said in a statement.
   ``The scope of the work that needs to be done under this program
underscores the value of preventing, rather than having to clean
up, pollution,'' Reilly said.
   The wide range of the cost estimates is due to markedly varied
conditions from site to site involving uncertain levels of ground
water monitoring and cleanup, the agency said.
   EPA said its plan allows corrective actions to be tailored to
site-specific conditions and sets health-based standards for the
cleanup of pollutants. The plan also contains requirements on how
wastes must be stored, treated or disposed of during cleanups.
Remedies would have to be consistent with those required under the
agency's Superfund cleanup program.
   Industries affected would include petroleum refiners, wood
preservers, metal finishers and auto manufacturers.
   Further information on the proposal can be obtained from EPA by
calling 1-800-424-9346.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Army, Air Force Could Cut Rosters by 120,000</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Faced with a lessening Soviet threat and fewer
dollars for defense, the Pentagon could cut Army and Air Force
rosters by 120,000 personnel by restricting re-enlistments,
imposing early retirements and reducing promotions, analysts said
Monday.
   But a study by the Congressional Budget Office found that the
savings from an across-the-board approach would amount to only $900
million from the $307 billion President Bush has proposed in
military spending in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   Savings totaling $1.4 billion would occur if the services simply
scaled back promotions, a step that would be feasible only if the
Army and Air Force expect no additional active-duty personnel cuts
beyond 1991, the CBO said.
   This approach, however, ``would create a `hole' in the enlisted
experience profile _ that is, the distribution of personnel over
years of service,'' the study said.
   The CBO also said that ``some loss of readiness is probably
inevitable whenever significant personnel reductions are made.
Slowing the pace of the drawdown might merely spread out its
effects.''
   At the request of Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis. and the chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee, the CBO examined the options in
reducing the two services by 120,000. The Navy and the Marine Corps
were not included in the study.
   The Bush administration, in its budget for fiscal 1991, has
proposed cutting active-duty strength by 38,000. About 80,000
troops would be withdrawn from Europe under the administration's
proposal in negotiations with the Soviet Union on reducing
conventional forces.
   Hardest hit by the administration's cutbacks would be the Army
and Air Force, the two services with the largest contingents
overseas. As of March 31, the Army had 764,259 active-duty
personnel. The Air Force has some 550,000.
   The analysis, which makes no recommendations, said the
across-the-board approach would include reduced promotions;
restricting first, second and third re-enlistments; selective early
retirements, and so-called ``involuntary separations'' of personnel
with more than six years of service.
   ``The approach to personnel reductions would avoid the hole in
the enlisted experience profile,'' the CBO said.
   However, the across-the-board approach would raise the thorny
issue of involuntary separations, or layoffs, for some personnel
with more than 10 years in the military.
   ``These people would have their lives disrupted, face at least
temporary unemployment and lose the chance to receive the
retirement benefits that may have been an important factor in their
earlier decisions to re-enlist,'' the CBO said.
   The analysis notes the three bills pending in Congress that
would provide severance pay for enlisted personnel who are
involuntarily separated.
   ``The proposed severance payments would offer fairer treatment
than is available under current law, which provides severance
payments only for officer personnel,'' the CBO said.

   Strong thunderstorms darkened skies in many eastern states
Monday, bringing heavy rains and 60 mph winds to the Ohio Valley.
   Winds gusted to 64 mph at Mansfield, Ohio, and storms spawned a
tornado at Celina and produced high winds which downed trees and
power lines in Mercer County, western Coshocton County and Union
County.
   A posted flood watch included Belmont County in eastern Ohio,
which last month was hit by flash floods that killed 26 people.
   Thunderstorms developed along a cold front and extended from
central Pennsylvania into northern Indiana Monday afternoon.
   Showers and thunderstorms also hit southern Florida and swept
through northern Mississippi, northern Alabama and eastern
Tennessee.
   Storms extended from southeastern Idaho to south-central
Montana, and from eastern South Dakota to northern Illinois, and
central Kansas.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with sunny
skies west of the Rockies.
   Strong southwesterly winds blew from the southern Plains to the
lower Missouri Valley, and along the middle Atlantic Coast.
   Temperatures were generally in the 90s by early Monday afternoon
from eastern Kansas and the southern Plains to the southern and
middle Atlantic Coast, with 100 degree readings reported in
Arkansas and western Tennessee.
   Temperatures were in the 70s in the central Plains, the upper
Mississippi Valley, the upper Great Lakes region, upstate New York
and northern New England.
   Temperatures were in the 60s and 70s along the northern and
central Pacific Coast, but soared into the 90s and above 100
degrees in the southwestern deserts.
   The nation's low Monday morning was 43 degrees at McCall, Idaho.

<HEAD>These Computer Birds Flock Together</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The age-old question of why birds of a
feather flock together could be answered with a few equations and a
computer, a zoology professor said Monday.
   Zoologist Frank H. Heppner of the University of Rhode Island and
Ulf Grenander, a Brown University applied mathematician, have
produced flocks of simulated birds by plugging in a few numbers,
building on the work of others who have shown that in a branch of
mathematics that deals with chaos there is order.
   ``We've got something here that looks like a bird flock or a
swarm of bees,'' Heppner said. ``So we know we can produce that
kind of behavior, but we're not sure why it works the way it does.''
   The implications are tremendous, say those familiar with the
field: New ways to control swarms of planes around busy airports,
crowd control, even simpler computer animation.
   The beauty is that the complex behavior comes from some simple
rules interacting with each other, said Christopher Langton, a
mathematician with Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.
Any minor change is magnified through the chain, much like one bird
swerving suddenly can divert the whole flock.
   ``That's what chaos is all about,'' he said.
   Heppner, 49, who calls himself ``just a simple country scientist
_ I like to work on things I can see,'' spent about 15 years
pursuing theories that flocks needed a leader, before a computer
game changed his thinking in 1987.
   The game, ``Life,'' uses a few simple rules to make squares
interact on a screen. Heppner made up some rules and when he tried
to generate patterns across the screen he realized ``this is a bird
flock.''
   He concluded that it explained the actions of a flock of
thousands of starlings, for instance, much better than looking for
a bird leader.
   He hooked up with Grenander, an amateur bird watcher, and
graduate student Daniel F. Potter, and they wrote equations and a
computer program.
   The simple rules were that birds like to be with each other, but
not too close. They probably will try to keep up with each other
and they will be attracted to something, such as a roost.
   Then, based on Heppner's real-life studies, they plugged in
numbers.
   Sometimes the little triangles representing birds would fly off
their perch on a simulated wire and come together, only to fly
apart again. Other times they would come together but fly off the
screen. ``Nine out of 10 times the birds didn't do anything,''
Heppner said.
   But sometimes the numbers would work, and the birds would swoop
around the roost in complicated, but cohesive patterns.
   ``It's very dramatic when you see it on the screen,'' said
Heppner.
   ``There's been a lot of serendipity with this,'' he said.
``We're really at the stage of playing with it.''
   The current model looks down on the simulated birds. Next is to
create a three-dimensional model that can be viewed sideways.
Heppner says the team then will compare it with videotapes of real
flocks.
   Heppner said he has had calls from people studying bee swarms
and from Federal Aviation Administration researchers wondering if
pilots, given more information about other planes in their area,
might naturally slide into landing formation without as much
intervention from controllers.
   A researcher from a military think-tank even called to see if
the team's work might help explain if soldiers without a leader
could function as a unit.
   ``What the birds would indicate is that, yeah, they probably
could reach a pretty decent decision,'' Heppner said.

<HEAD>Stately Mansion is Site of Summit Dinner</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Summit Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The seven world leaders attending the economic
summit have dinner reservations Monday night at Bayou Bend, a
stately mansion that once was the home of the late Ima Hogg, the
oil-rich daughter of the first native-born governor of Texas.
   It will be the first time that a U.S. president, much less the
heads of government of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada or
Japan, have dined at Bayou Bend since it became a museum nearly a
quarter-century ago.
   Sitting amid Miss Hogg's collection of antiques and art objects,
the summit leaders will dine on tortilla soup, cornbread sticks,
grilled gulf red snapper, sweet corn puree and onions, lettuce and
almond salad and American cheeses. For dessert, there will be
blackberry peach swirl ice cream with sliced peaches and cookies.
   Miss Hogg was a widely known Texas philanthropist from a family
that made a fortune in oil and real estate. Her father, James Hogg,
was the first native-born Texan to become the state's governor.
   Bayou Bend was built in 1927 along a bend in Buffalo Bayou. The
14-acre estate opened as a museum in 1966. It is situated in the
River Oaks section on Lazy Lane, the most exclusive street in
Houston. The home's value is unknown, but real estate broker Diane
Lokey said the Dogwood Gardens estate next door listed for $11.5
million.
   Bayou Bend Director David B. Warren said the museum was chosen
for the summit dinner partly because of its intimate, historical
atmosphere.
   ``Surrounded by this wonderful collection of American art,
objects and furniture, the president will be able to convey a grand
sense of this country's heritage to our visitors,'' Warren said.

<HEAD>Robert Mapplethorpe Exhibit: Not Banned in Boston</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years after the film ``Caligula'' was seized
by city vice detectives, the controversial photographs of Robert
Mapplethorpe will arrive next month with the impassioned backing of
the Institute of Contemporary Art.
   Far from being banned in Boston, Mapplethorpe's work will
receive extra security, the director of the institute said Monday,
to ensure that it is properly showcased in the city where
Mapplethorpe died of AIDS a year ago.
   The exhibit will also receive corporate sponsorship for the
first time on the tour, from Phoenix Media@Communications Group.
   Despite threats of protest from a Catholic lay group, ICA
director David Ross said the museum wouldn't omit the seven
sexually graphic photographs in the exhibit. The collection of 160
photographs, which includes still lifes, portraits and nudes, will
be on exhibit from Aug. 1 to Oct 4.
   ``We promised him we would do what we could to make sure the
exhibit was shown according to his wishes,'' said Ross. ``Robert
Mapplethorpe was a friend of mine and someone I knew for 15 years.
We're showing this because we believe Robert Mapplethorpe was an
important artist. His work spoke to the tenor of our times, as all
good artists do.''
   To edit out the controversial works would be ``egregious,'' Ross
said. ``He was an artist whose career deserved an entire
retrospective.''
   Philip Lawler of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil
Rights said the art institute can ``count on some strong
demonstration of outrage.''
   Lawler and former Boston Mayor John Collins have called on Mayor
Raymond Flynn to stop the exhibit. Flynn aides have said the mayor
will not block the show.
   ``Caligula,'' a sexually graphic 1980 film about ancient Rome,
was the last casualty of the legendary censorship that led to the
phrase ``Banned in Boston.'' Since the last century, at least 16
books have been banned in Boston, according to the American Library
Association. Casualties included works by Theodore Dreiser, Ernest
Hemingway and Elizabeth Barrett Browning.
   Controversy has trailed the Mapplethorpe exhibit in its tour
around the country. Last month an Ohio judge ruled that an art
gallery and its director must stand trial for displaying two
Mapplethorpe photographs that included nude or semi-nude children.
   A county grand jury indicted the Contemporary Arts Center in
Cincinnati and director Dennis Barrie on April 7, the day the
exhibit opened.
   Ross called the Cincinnati indictment a ``very sad event. It's
not a good day for museum directors when they're hauled off to
court for doing what museum directors have been doing for years.''
   The Boston show concludes an 18-month tour that included stops
in Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Hartford, Conn.,
Berkeley, Calif., and Cincinnati.

<HEAD>Engineers Find Hydrogen Leak During California Test</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New material thruout</NOTE>

   NASA officials said Monday they still have not
pinpointed the mysterious hydrogen leak that grounded the space
shuttle fleet, even though engineers repeated the leak in
laboratory tests.
   Rockwell International engineers detected escaping hydrogen in a
weekend test of hardware from space shuttle Columbia, but NASA
space flight director William Lenoir said engineers still don't
know the precise valve, pipe or seal in the complex plumbing of the
liquid hydrogen rocket fuel system that is leaking.
   The Rockwell test, in effect, proved that the leak was related
to the design or assembly of the equipment. Lenoir said the next
step now is to find the exact source.
   ``My biggest fear was that we would go through the Downey test
and get no leak at all,'' said Lenoir. ``I'm encouraged.''
   Finding no leak, officials said, would have made the leak even
more puzzling and more difficult to repair.
   Space shuttle program director Robert Crippen cautioned that
although the leak discovery is important ``we really do not know
what the problem is yet. We haven't eliminated anything yet.''
   An even more important leak test is planned for Friday or
Saturday on space shuttle Atlantis, which is on a launch pad at the
Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
   Lenoir said the ``prime suspect'' for the source of the leak is
a U-shaped Teflon seal that is supposed to keep hydrogen from
leaking from what is called a disconnect. This disconnect is in a
17-inch hydrogen pipe that pulls apart when the shuttle rocket
propellant tank is jettisoned after launch.
   Rockwell engineers at the company's Downey, Calif., plant found
the leak during weekend tests when liquid hydrogen was pumped
through an apparatus of pipes, seals and valves, called an
umbilical, which had been removed from the shuttle Columbia.
   The umbilical carries rocket propellant from the shuttle's large
orange tank to the rocket engines in the orbiter, the winged
spacecraft that carries the astronauts. The 17-inch disconnect
separates halves of the umbilical.
   The umbilical also is used to load the fuel tank before launch.
The hydrogen leak on Columbia was first detected in May, when
technicians were pumping the supercold hydrogen on board. The
mission was postponed and the umbilical on Columbia was removed and
sent to Rockwell for testing.
   A second hydrogen leak was found on Atlantis last month. As a
precaution, NASA grounded all three shuttles until the leaks are
fixed.
   The Rockwell test was a laboratory experiment that did not
exactly duplicate the conditions that occurred when Columbia's leak
was detected, said Lenoir. He said it was a static test that
attempted to match the pressures and the minus 420 degree
temperature of liquid hydrogen, but it could not match the 84
gallon-a-minute flow used when the tank is being filled.
   The test late this week on Atlantis will match all conditions of
the earlier leaks. Lenoir and Crippen said that Atlantis' umbilical
is being outfitted with sensors and with plastic bags to capture
and detect leaking hydrogen. It is hoped that the test will help to
isolated the source of the leak.
   But Crippen noted, ``We have not eliminated the possibility that
we might have two different problems on the two different
vehicles.''
   Liquid hydrogen is at minus 420 degrees when it is pumped into
the shuttle fuel tank. Preflight tests of the umbilical had been
conducted in the past using liquid nitrogen or helium, both of
which are warmer than liquid hydrogen. The pipes and valves on
Columbia and Atlantis had passed the nitrogen and helium tests.
   It was only when the supercold hydrogen was pumped on board that
the leaks occurred.
   Rockwell engineers used liquid hydrogen, but NASA spokesman Kyle
Herring said the rate of flow in the laboratory experiment is
slower than what is used when the tank is being filled.
   The shuttles' main rocket engines burn liquid hydrogen and
liquid oxygen. The supercold chemicals are loaded into separate
vessels inside the propellant tank, the 153-foot-long tank attached
to the belly of the orbiter during launch.
   In Houston, meanwhile, NASA said it was grounding two veteran
shuttle crew commanders, Navy Cmdr. Robert L. ``Hoot'' Gibson and
Navy Capt. David M. Walker, for violations of flight crew
operations guidelines.
   NASA said Gibson was removed from shuttle flight assignments and
from T-38 jet trainer flight status for one year for violating a
policy that restricts high-risk recreational activities for
astronauts named to flight crews.
   Gibson's stunt plane collided Saturday with another plane,
sending the second craft hurtling into a cornfield and killing its
pilot, Henry W. Jones Jr., 69, a retired fighter pilot.
   Walker was suspended for a May 1989 incident in which the pilot
of a Pan Am plane reported a ``near midair collision'' between his
aircraft and a T-38 flown by Walker.

   Officials of the seven industrialized democracies
debated on Monday whether to relax the restrictions they proposed
last year on trade with China.
   Diplomatic sources said only Japan favored a lenient approach.
   It was the only unsettled foreign policy issue apart from how
much aid to extend to the Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in
his effort to pep up his country's economy.
   Last July, the United States, Japan, Britain, France, Canada,
Italy and West Germany condemned the repression of pro-democracy
forces in China. The seven nations agreed that an examination of
new loans by the World Bank be postponed. Also, the countries
extended the stays of Chinese students in the seven countries.
   Since then, Chinese authorities have released thousands of
political prisoners, but others are still being detained.
   The sources, speaking on condition they remain anonymous, said
there is no split between the United States and Canada and the four
European nations on taking a tough line in the political communique
to be issued on Tuesday. Only Japan favors a softer line, the
sources told The Associated Press.
   On two other issues unanimity was reported.
   President Bush and the six other leaders will condemn terrorism
and deplore the proliferation of missiles and nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons technology.

<HEAD>Witness Uses Dollar Bill to Show How Barry Snorted Cocaine</HEAD>

   Using a rolled up dollar bill, a Tehran-born
restaurateur demonstrated on the witness stand Monday how he said
Mayor Marion Barry repeatedly snorted cocaine, once only minutes
before giving a speech.
   Hassan Mohammadi said he furnished cocaine to Barry about 30
times, once delivering more than 2 grams of the drug to the mayor
in his office.
   ``He wouldn't ask for cocaine, but say, `What's happening? Are
you loaded?''' the witness said.
   Barry never paid, Mohammadi testified. In fact, he said, on a
November 1987 trip to the Bahamas, Barry played blackjack using the
$3,000-$4,000 worth of chips that Mohammadi bought.
   The mayor leaned back in his chair at the defense table,
sometimes smiling, once grinning broadly. During breaks in the
proceedings he joked with his lawyers, his campaign manager and his
press secretary.
   Mohammadi, who immigrated from Iran in 1972 at the age of 18,
said he met Barry at a District of Columbia party during the
Democratic National Convention in San Francisco in 1984. He invited
the mayor to the grand opening of Pardi's restaurant, in the
Georgetown section of Washington, in February 1985.
   The first time he saw Barry ingest cocaine, the witness said,
was on that occasion, in an office atop the restaurant.
   Mohammadi said he, Barry, and nightclub owner Samad Arshadi,
went upstairs where Arshadi, placed some powder on the table.
   Using a credit card, Arshadi ``made a line'' out of the powder
``and he and Mr. Mayor snorted'' the substance through a rolled-up
bill, said Mohammadi.
   ``He bent over the coke and he snorted,'' Mohammadi said of the
mayor.
   Barry then licked his fingers to make them wet and began
``cleaning his nose with his fingers,'' said Mohammadi. The mayor
finished the cleaning by rubbing his fingers across the table top,
the businessman testified.
   The men then went downstairs and Barry ``made a speech'' to the
guests at the packed restaurant's grand opening, said Mohammadi.
   Then followed visits by the mayor to Mohammadi's apartment
nearby in which Mohammadi and Barry snorted cocaine. There was
another occasion in a room at the Capital Hilton and a number of
times in the Cable Beach Hotel in the Bahamas.
   ``Did you force the defendant to accept those quantities of
cocaine from you?'' asked Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts.
   ``Not at all,'' the witness said.
   ``Did anyone force the defendant to accept those quantities of
cocaine?''
   ``No.''
   Barry is charged with 10 counts of cocaine possession, one count
of conspiracy and three counts of lying to a federal grand jury
about his alleged involvement with drugs.
   Throughout his testimony, Mohammadi referred to Barry as ``Mr.
Mayor.''
   At Roberts' urging, Mohammadi demonstrated how Barry allegedly
rolled up a bill, put his left finger to close off one nostril and
inhaled through the bill with his right nostril.
   At that point in Mohammadi's demonstration, Barry grinned
broadly.
   At the start of the afternoon session, with the jury out of the
room, Roberts said he intended to elicit testimony from Mohammadi
that he also saw Barry use marijuana and opium on several occasions.
   ``At one cookout,'' said Roberts, ``there was use of cocaine and
opium.''
   Roberts said the proposed testimony was to show ``the
defendant's predisposition toward controlled substances,'' to
counter defense claims that Barry was trapped into using cocaine on
Jan. 18 when he was arrested.
   Mohammadi said that as part of his agreement with prosecutors to
testify against Barry, the government promised to speak up for him
in any deportation proceedings. Mohammadi has pleaded guilty to one
count of conspiring with Barry to possess cocaine.
   Earlier, a prosecution witness testified that she smoked crack
cocaine as recently as last month and had used drugs six days
before she appeared before the grand jury that indicted the mayor.
   In cross-examination, Lydia Pearson stuck to her story that she
had sold crack to the mayor 20 to 25 times in a three month period
in 1988, delivering one shipment along with an application for a
city job.

   A top State Department official lodged a
protest Monday with the Kenyan ambassador over the East African
nation's criticism of the United States.
   Herman Cohen, the assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, made the complaint in a meeting with Kenyan ambassador
Denis Afande amid continuing clashes in Kenya between the
government and pro-democracy protesters.
   ``We protested the language they have been using against our
ambassador,'' said a State Department official who spoke on the
condition he remain anonymous. The official said Washington is
concerned with statements by Kenyan officials that somehow the
United States is fueling the demonstrations.
   ``We also made it clear that (U.S.) Ambassador (Smith) Hempstone
has our full support,'' the official said.
   The meeting came as Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., chairman of the
House Africa subcommittee, said he would press Congress to freeze
or cut U.S. aid to Kenya until that country improves its human
rights record.
   ``I am deeply disturbed by these developments,'' Wolpe said of
the events in Kenya. ``They are clearly are not isolated
incidents.''
   Wolpe said he has directed his aides to come up with a strategy
for halting millions of dollars in development and military
assistance given to Kenya.
   Wolpe's comments came as U.S. officials said they are helping
Gibson Kumau Kuria, a human rights lawyer, find a way to leave the
country.
   Kuria, 43, sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi on
Saturday. Earlier, Kuria had been detained by the government of
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, who has banned political
pluralism in the one-party state.
   Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Kuria is the only
activist who had taken refuge in the U.S. Embassy. Kuria ``has
expressed a desire to leave Kenya, and we are assisting with
necessary arrangements,'' Boucher said
   The Kuria case came up in the meeting between Cohen and the
Kenyan ambassador.
   In Nairobi, meantime, police used force to quell anti-government
protests that have spread from Nairobi to other cities. In the last
three days, eight people have been killed in rioting.
   Wolpe has long been concerned about human rights in Kenya. Last
month, he joined Reps. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Gus Yatron, D-Pa., in asking
Moi to relax his clamps on political activists. The lawmakers
received no reply.
   A congressional aide, speaking on condition he remain anonymous,
said Wolpe is seeking a consensus on how lawmakers want to handle
aid to Kenya. Many members are out of town for the July 4th recess.
   One option is to freeze what is left in the unobligated accounts
for fiscal yer 1990, the aide said. Washington has promised Kenya
$35 million in development aid for the year. All but $8 million has
been sent. The Kenyans have also been promised $10 million in
military aid.
   Another option is to cut money for the fiscal year beginning in
October. The House has passed a bill that includes about $33
million in economic aid and $9.1 million in military aid. That
measure is pending in the Senate.
   Congress would not touch money for the Peace Corps or food aid.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has won another political
victory, gaining Communist Party approval to restructure the
Politburo that once ruled the country. The Politburo now promises
to play second fiddle to the separate government structure he also
leads.
   The vote by the 28th Communist Party Congress on Monday also
marks a new effort to reduce the ethnic unrest that is tearing the
Soviet Union apart by including party leaders from the 15 Soviet
republics on the Politburo, the party's ruling inner circle.
   The new body will have up to 23 members, nearly twice the 12
voting members on the old body, and many if not most of the faces
should be new.
   The expansion and restructuring will accelerate the process that
Gorbachev began after he was elected to a strengthened presidency
in March, transferring power to a newly created Presidential
Council _ a development that has angered such hard-line Politburo
members as Yegor K. Ligachev and could squeeze them out of their
jobs.
   Unlike the Politburo, whose members are elected by the party,
members of the Presidential Council are appointed and dismissed by
the president, along the lines of a Western-style cabinet.
   The Politburo, which formerly met once every Thursday, has been
meeting only once a month since March, and has been concentrating
on Communist Party rather than government issues.
   Since most of the Politburo members will reside in their home
republics, the Politburo will continue to meet relatively
infrequently and will not exercise as tight control over national
affairs as the body has traditionally done.
   The duties of the government council have not been fully
defined. The 16-man body consists of six voting members of the
Politburo, including the prime minister, defense minister, foreign
minister, the KGB chief, and Gorbachev's right-hand man, Alexander
Yakovlev. Other members are the chief law enforcement official, a
reform-minded economist, a crusading environmentalist and a
workers' rights activist.
   Significantly, whereas nine of 12 men on the old Politburo were
members of the ethnic Russian majority, the new Politburo will
include a majority of non-Russians. And the Presidential Council
contains five non-Russians.
   The new Politburo will include the heads of the party
organizations in the 15 republics, most of whom are clamoring for
greater control over political and economic decisions affecting
their regions.
   Shortly after becoming general secretary of the Communist Party
five years ago, Gorbachev sought to centralize his authority, but
he has been driven to support greater regional autonomy by the
independence drives of the three Baltic republics.
   Moreover, the largest Soviet republic, the Russian Federation,
last month proclaimed its intent to seek greater control of its
affairs under the leadership of its populist Communist president,
Boris N. Yeltsin.
   Mostly recently, Gorbachev has embraced the idea of
reconstituting the Soviet Union as a looser confederation of
republics.
   The Politburo has had its ups and downs since it was created on
the eve of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution that swept the Communists
to power. The first two Soviet leaders, Vladimir I. Lenin and Josef
V. Stalin, exercised virtual one man rule, appointing aides and
allies to the Politburo.
   Under Leonid Brezhnev, who ruled for 18 years until his death in
1982, the Politburo was a coalition that made all the key decisions.
   As Brezhnev and the other Politburo members weakened with age,
the country lapsed into what Gorbachev has labeled the period of
stagnation.
   The first Politburo consisted of seven Bolsheviks, among them
Lenin, the founder of the Red Army Leon Trotsky, and the
lesser-known Stalin.
   Following Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin eliminated Trotsky and
other rivals from the ruling body. By the height of his power in
1952, he had expanded the membership to 25 voting members, all
loyal aides. It also included 11 non-voting members.
   Nikita S. Khrushchev, who rose to power after Stalin's death in
1953, whittled the body to 15 voting and nine non-voting members.
Although he instituted reforms, he tried to keep a tight personal
grip on power, angering Politburo colleagues who tried
unsuccessfully to oust him in 1957 and succeeded in 1964.
   Brezhnev, Khrushchev's successor, used the Politburo to forge a
coalition among Soviet interest groups, such as the armed forces,
the KGB, other government ministries and major industrial sectors,
who held most of the dozen slots.
   He also included seven heads of republic parties as non-voting
Politburo members, allowing them to run their regions in return for
loyalty. Gorbachev and his allies argue that Brezhnev's system led
to widescale corruption and blocked the transformation of the
country into a modern industrial society.

<HEAD>Incidents Prompt Warnings Along Appalachian Trail</HEAD>

   Appalachian Trail hikers have been
urged not to stop or stray along a 14-mile stretch of the
Maine-to-Georgia route because of a series of suspicious fires and
booby traps.
   Forest Service officials blame the incidents, which include the
stringing of fish hooks at eye- and hip-level across paths, on a
dispute between the government and landowners who fear their land
will be seized to create a 500-foot buffer along the trail.
   The Forest Service has put up signs encouraging hikers not to
stop or leave the trail in the Buck Mountain area between Roan
Mountain and the North Carolina state line, Forest Service
spokesman Bill Sweet said.
   ``Hikers have been scared by them and since we don't know what
we're dealing with, that's a good thing,'' said Brian King, public
affairs director for the Appalachian Trail Conference, based at
Harpers Ferry, W.Va.
   ``We haven't had any problems there since late April,'' King
said Monday. No decision has been made on when the signs may be
removed.
   King said that in April a shelter on the trail was destroyed by
fire. Authorities determined that someone had pulled brush into the
shelter and ignited it. Suspicious brush fires also were reported
in the area.
   King said no injuries were reported.
   Sweet said no arrests have been made and none are expected.
``There's no way to have a very effective investigation,'' Sweet
said.
   Congress has mandated that the Forest Service acquire about 500
feet on each side of the 2,143-mile trail.
   But Sweet said the Forest Service does not intend to take
anyone's land in the disputed area, and is looking at an alternate
route for that part of the trail in order to comply with federal
law.
   He said he believed that message had gotten through to
landowners.
   ``We don't think the trail hikers are in any danger,'' Sweet
said. ``We just don't want to encourage people to get off the
trail'' for these 14 miles.

<HEAD>Police Hunt for White Extremist Group Members Linked to Bombing</HEAD>

   Police hunted Monday for
members of the White Liberation Army, which claimed responsibility
for a bombing that injured 27 blacks and threatened to carry out
more such attacks to preserve white rule.
   Meanwhile, four more white right-wing activists were arrested in
connection with an investigation of a series of recent bomb attacks
against opponents of the apartheid system, according to police and
news reports.
   Three of the men appeared briefly in the Johannesburg
Magistrates Court on Monday in connection with the possession of
weapons, although they have not yet been charged with any crime.
   So far 13 whites have been arrested in a police crackdown that
began over the weekend against right-wing extremist groups
suspected in the bombings.
   The Star newspaper reported Monday that security police hunting
right-wing groups had uncovered a huge cache of weapons and
explosives.
   The White Liberation Army took responsibility late Sunday for
Friday's bombing of a black bus terminal in central Johannesburg.
The bombing was one of at least six in Johannesburg the past 10
days.
   The group, calling itself the Wit Bevrydingsleer in Afrikaans,
said in a fax to newspapers late Sunday that it planted the bomb to
protest government plans to end white-minority rule. It warned
there would be more bombings.
   The message was sprinkled with racist insults against blacks. It
called Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, who heads the police, a
``traitor.''
   A police official, who declined to be named, said the
authorities had heard of the White Liberation Army before and were
hunting for its members.
   It is one of several extreme right-wing groups linked to violent
attacks in recent weeks, he said. The bombing targets included an
anti-apartheid Afrikaans newspaper, a Jewish synagogue and several
liberal politicians.
   Police said Sunday they had detained nine white men in
connection with the recent bombings, but no charges have been filed
against them yet. Vlok said all were being held under the Internal
Security Act, which allows for indefinite detention without trial.
   ``The people arrested are all supporters of a far right
political ideology, but can not thus far be connected to any
particular organization,'' Vlok said.
   He said three prominent right-wingers were among those arrested,
identifying them as Leonard Veenendaal, Darryl Stopforth and David
Rootenberg.
   He said the other six arrested could not yet be named because of
the delicate nature of the investigation.
   Vlok said the arrests quashed any suggestion that police were
tardy in their investigation of right-wing extremists.
   Right-wing whites have expressed outrage at President F.W. de
Klerk's plans to end apartheid and share power with the black
majority.
   Both de Klerk and the African National Congress, the leading
black opposition group, have acknowledged a terrorist campaign by
heavily armed right-wing whites could undermine black-white
negotiations.
   The Sunday Times of Johannesburg described Rootenberg as ``a
close friend'' of Barend Strydom, who is on death row for killing
seven blacks and an Indian in a racially motivated shooting spree
in Pretoria in 1988.
   Eugene Terre'blanche, leader of the right-wing Afrikaner
Resistance Movement, said Monday the arrests offered ``tragic
proof'' that the government was yielding to the ANC and the
Communists, who play an influential role in the black nationalist
group's leadership.
   ``The government is recklessly busy intimidating right-wingers
in order to impress its Communist Party allies so that they can go
to the negotiation table as fast as possible,'' he said.
   He warned there would be ``greater actions of resistance and
anger'' from whites if those arrested continue to be held without
trial.
   The African National Congress had earlier criticized police for
failing to solve any of the recent bombings, but on Monday the
group said it ``appreciated'' the arrests.
   Walter Sisulu, the ANC internal leader, said the movement had
demanded right-wing suspects be detained as ANC suspects had been
in the past.
   Sisulu said there was an essential difference between the
bombings committed by the right-wing extremists and the armed
struggle launched by the ANC against the white minority government
in 1961.
   He said the ANC's struggle was part of a human rights campaign
on behalf of disenfranchised blacks, while the whites already had
the vote and extensive privileges.
   ``They just have no reason to take up arms except to act as
terrorists,'' Sisulu said.
   Most right-wing whites are Afrikaners, the Dutch-descended
settlers of South Africa who account for 3 million of the 5 million
whites.
   The right-wing whites want to maintain the apartheid system of
racial separation that denies political and economic rights to the
30 million black majority.

   NASA on Monday grounded two veteran
shuttle crew commanders, one involved in a fatal collision of stunt
planes at a weekend air show and one accused of flying too close to
an airliner.
   Navy Cmdr. Robert L. ``Hoot'' Gibson and Navy Capt. David M.
Walker were grounded for violations of Johnson Space Center flight
crew operations guidelines, NASA said. Gibson was grounded for one
year, Walker for 60 days.
   ``This is the first time we have removed crew members from
flights for disciplinary reasons,'' said NASA spokesman Jeff Carr.
   Gibson, 43, piloted an eight-day Challenger mission in 1984 and
commanded the 1986 Columbia mission and the December 1988 Atlantis
mission.
   Walker piloted a space shuttle flight in 1984 and was commander
of the space shuttle Atlantis during a four-day flight in May 1989.
   NASA said Gibson was removed from shuttle flight assignments and
from T-38 jet trainer flight status for one year for violating a
policy that restricts high-risk recreational activities for
astronauts named to flight crews.
   Gibson's stunt plane on Saturday collided with another plane
during a Texas airshow. The second craft hurtled into a cornfield
and killed its pilot, Henry W. Jones Jr., 69, a retired fighter
pilot from Newport News, Va.
   Gibson landed his plane safely at the New Braunfels Municipal
Airport, 25 miles northeast of San Antonio.
   Donald R. Puddy, director of flight crew operations, said
Gibson's participation in the event was a ``clear violation of
safety.''
   Walker was scheduled to command a Department of Defense mission
in March 1991. He was replaced on the flight and suspended from
T-38 flight status, NASA said.
   Walker was suspended for a May 1989 incident in which the pilot
of a Pan Am Airbus 310 reported a ``near mid-air collision''
between his aircraft and a T-38 jet flown by Walker near
Washington's Dulles International Airport.
   A near collision is generally reported when two planes come
within 500 feet of each other and either pilot feels the planes
were in danger of colliding.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said air traffic controllers
filed a ``pilot deviation report'' accusing Walker of violating
flight procedures. It said the planes came within 100 feet
vertically but that it was not clear how near the planes were at
their closest point.
   Walker had descended to 7,000 feet _ the assigned altitude of
the Pan Am airliner _ when a controller ordered him to climb to
8,000 feet, FAA spokesman John Leyden said at the time.
   Carr said the timing of the two groundings was ``an incredible
coincidence.''
   The decision to ground Walker was made a week ago, but the
announcement was delayed while authorities searched for a
replacement for him on next year's Pentagon shuttle flight, Carr
said.
   Walker had come up for disciplinary action review because of a
number of ``aircraft operating infractions,'' including the Pan Am
incident, Carr said. He refused to disclose any of the other
infractions.

   Homeless people, activists and others who
mourned the death of Mitch Snyder lined up in sweltering heat
Monday to pay last respects to the man who ended his own life after
years of fighting for the downtrodden.
   ``I always liked what he did,'' said Margaret Moore, a homeless
woman who waited with others outside the shelter where Snyder's
body lay. ``I didn't know anything about homeless people until I
became one. I thought they all were bums. But I listened to him,
and it helped me to learn that the homeless are people too.''
   The mourners, waiting in temperatures that approached 100
degrees, stood in a line that snaked around the three-story shelter
Snyder had fought to win from the federal government. Inside, his
body lay in simple pine casket.
   Snyder's long-time companion, Carol Fennelly, said she hoped the
commitment of many activists would not fade with the death of the
nation's most visible advocate for the homeless.
   ``I want people not to remember him and go on with their lives
but remember him and do something to make a difference,'' she said.
``We can't ever bring him back or replace him, but we can carry
on.''
   Members of the Community for Creative Non-Violence, the group
Snyder spoke for, were also planning to keep pushing to help the
destitute as they mourned Snyder's death.
   ``He learned to love everybody but himself,'' said CCNV
volunteer Ronald Williams said. ``It's a story of human frailty,
and tragedy, I guess.''
   The funeral was planned as the sort of gathering that Snyder
often organized to promote causes for the needy.
   Snyder will be cremated after a funeral Tuesday that will
include a march to city hall in which Snyder's body will be carried
in a horse-drawn carriage, said Fennelly. His remains will be kept
at the shelter alongside those of homeless men and women who have
died, many anonymously, on the streets of the nation's capital.
   Fennelly spoke with reporters only on condition that she not be
asked to discuss her relationship with Snyder.
   Snyder's body was found hanging from an electrical cord last
Thursday, near a note that police said contained ``suicidal
references.'' Law enforcement sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the note referred to problems he was having in his
relationship with Fennelly. The two had known each other for 13
years and had planned a September wedding.
   ``All I am willing to say right now is that he was very tired,''
Fennelly said. ``It's such a personal tragedy.''
   She called Snyder's life of commitment ``a magical moment in
time.''
   Jesse Jackson, Mayor Marion Barry, actor Martin Sheen, and the
Rev. Philip Berrigan were scheduled to speak.
   Sheen portrayed Snyder in a made-for-television film about
Snyder's battles on behalf of the homeless. Snyder credited
Berrigan and his brother Daniel, who is also a Roman Catholic
priest, with helping him turn his life around.

<TEXT>
   The Alaska Legislature has adjourned its
two-week special session after failing to agree on a way to end a
federal takeover of game management on two-thirds of the state's
land.
   The House, which agreed only that something needed to be done,
ended up doing nothing by Sunday's adjournment, after the Senate
had approved a constitutional amendment in the session's first week.
   The problem arose when the Alaska Supreme Court in December
declared unconstitutional part of a state law that gave rural
Alaskans preferential rights to subsistence hunting and fishing.
   The court said the law discriminated against urban hunters and
fishermen; an estimated 110,000 Alaskans venture into the wild to
hunt, fish and gather plants for food.
   That ruling put the state at odds with a fderal law that
requires a rural preference on federal lands in Alaska. Because of
the discrepancy, five federal agencies took over game management
from the state on federal lands July 1. Management of fisheries
remained under state control.
   Gov. Steve Cowper and the Democratic majority were unable to get
enough votes in the House for any of several amendments they
proposed to restore the subsistence preference for rural residents.
   Democrat Cowper, two-thirds of the Republican-led Senate,
Alaska's all-Republican congressional delegation, the state's two
largest newspapers and its largest native groups supported a
constitutional amendment.
   But the 16-member Republican minority in the House remained
solidly against amending the constitution, contending that would
weaken the document's equal-rights guarantee. The minority said the
state instead should challenge the federal law in court.
   A two-thirds majority _ 27 votes _ in the House was needed to
refer an amendment to voters in November. The most votes any of the
amendments attracted was 23.
   Minority Leader Robin Taylor, R-Wrangell, said the defeat of the
amendments was his ``proudest moment'' in six years in the
Legislature. ``What we have done is we have protected the bill of
rights so that equality still exists among Alaska citizens,''
Taylor said.
   Some of his fellow Republicans did not share Taylor's pride.
   ``Federal intervention in the management of Alaska game is a
serious affront to the state,'' Senate President Tim Kelly said.
``The Legislature, had it acted, could have avoided it. I think
it's going to be much tougher to regain control with the more time
that goes by.''
   Julie Kitka, president of the Alaska Federation of Natives, said
the lack of action was a setback for the state.
   ``A number of native people in villages will see this as a
failure of the state system to respond to real needs of people, and
to let people decide their own destinies and future,'' she said.

   A federal judge told attorneys Monday he doubted
he would take action in a lawsuit challenging Georgia's
majority-rule vote before next week's state primary elections.
   U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman addressed the timeliness
of the suit at the end of the first day of testimony in the case.
   David Walbert, an attorney representing the state, had asked
Freeman if Tuesday's session could start a few hours later than
scheduled. Freeman responded: ``The longer we wait, the harder it
will be to get this done. ... I don't think it will be done anyway,
to be perfectly frank.''
   Freeman noted that the lawsuit challenging the majority-vote
requirement was filed in May, though a motion asking him to stop
the use of the requirement in the July 17 primary was filed only
last week _ ``at the last minute.''
   The lawsuit filed by a group of black officials contends that
the 1964 majority vote law, which requires a runoff when one
candidate fails to win a majority, effectively keeps blacks out of
public office.
   The lawsuit seeks to replace the current system with a plurality
method, which would give the election to the candidate who wins the
most votes.
   The plaintiffs say the majority-vote requirement hurts black
candidates because it is difficult for them to win more than 50
percent of the vote in a state that is about three-quarters white.
   Freeman did not indicate if he was leaning toward either side in
deciding the suit.
   Laughlin McDonald, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney
representing the plaintiffs, said filing the suit before the
election gives the plaintiffs the option, if the judge rules
against them, of maintaining their objections to the election
results and seeking to have them changed afterward.
   The first witness in the case was a political scientist from the
California Institute of Technology, who testified there were
numerous indications that the Georgia Legislature had racial
motivations in enacting the majority-vote law.
   J. Morgan Kousser, a professor of history and social science and
the author of a book on Southern politics, said state Rep. Denmark
Groover pushed the majority-vote law through the Legislature after
national civil rights legislation led to the abolition of the
state's county unit election system. That system, resembling the
electoral college system of choosing presidents, awarded one to
three ``units'' to a candidate for each county he carried.
   Kousser said Groover was at the time an avowed segregationist.
   Groover, who lost his legislative seat in 1958 to a moderate
white candidate with considerable black support, had publicly
complained about black ``block voting,'' according to Kousser.
   Groover returned to the Legislature in 1962. In 1984, Kousser
said, Groover admitted that in the early 1960s ``I was a
segregationist ... I had my prejudices and I don't mind admitting
it.''
   McDonald said he does not plan to call Groover as a witness.
   Kousser said there were other signs that lawmakers in 1964
wanted to keep blacks out of public office, including an attempt to
stiffen the literacy test for voter registration.

   African leaders gave a standing
ovation Monday to Nelson Mandela, who declared that South Africa's
apartheid system was nearing its end in a speech to the opening
session of the 26th Organization of African Unity summit.
   The deputy president of the African National Congress made a
triumphant appearance at the OAU summit just five months after
South African President F.W. de Klerk released him from prison and
agreed to talks with black leaders on ending apartheid.
   ``Nothing can stop the emancipation process,'' the deputy
president of the African National Congress told the gathering of
African leaders in the Ethiopian capital.
   ``The days of apartheid are numbered,'' Mandela, 71, said to
thunderous applause.
   Mandela, who was accompanied by his wife Winnie, was making his
first appearance at a summit of the 51-member OAU, which joins
together the black and Arab states of the African continent.
   The three-day summit is expected to focus on the impact on
Africa of the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, popular
demands for multiparty democracy, the growing plight of refugees on
the continent, and how to deal with foreign debts now totaling more
than $250 billion for member states.
   The African leaders are likely to issue declarations on these
issues at the closing session on Wednesday.
   Mandela, who spoke for 10 minutes at the opening session,
appeared weary after his recently concluded month-long tour of
European, North American and African countries aimed at winning
support for the ANC and backing for continued sanctions against the
white minority government.
   He nodded off briefly several times during the opening addresses
by other African leaders.
   In his speech, Mandela paid tribute to the OAU for its
assistance to the African National Congress during the 27 years he
spent in prison for his anti-apartheid activities.
   He said the OAU's backing had given the ANC ``inspiration and
strength'' in its efforts to gain full political rights for South
Africa's black majority.
   ``Only South Africa now remains victim of white minority rule in
Africa,'' he declared, praising the help provided by the OAU in
bringing the black majority to power in Zimbabwe and Namibia.
   Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam, the summit host,
welcomed the recent political reforms in South Africa that led to
the release of Mandela and other anti-apartheid activists from
prison.
   But he said these measures ``have in no way affected the basic
structure of the inhuman system of apartheid.''
   In his opening speech, Mengistu hailed Mandela as ``a shining
symbol of the struggle for liberation and a man of unbreakable will
... a true son of Africa.''

   President Bush figured there was more on
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's mind than trade and economics when he
arrived for the start of the summit.
   ``Hail the champions of football,'' the president said as he
greeted the West German leader, who missed a rodeo and other
pre-summit festivities so he could watch the German team beat
Argentina, 1-0, in the World Cup soccer final.
   ``World champions! It's a big win for Germany.'' Bush said.
``There must be great excitement at home.''
   Later, Bush told Kohl he was a soccer player in college. Bush
played for Yale University in 1945.
   ``I loved the game, and the American people are lod more,'' said Bush.
The United States hosts the next World Cup
in 1994.
   `ving it more
an`I think President Bush is going to inaugurate that great event
in four years,'' said Kohl.
   ``Either as an unemployed person or as president,'' Bush said.

   One buffet line in the giant food hall at the media center is a
concession to the summit's only non-Western nation.
   Offerings include tofu soup, squid and other delicacies familiar
to the Japanese press delegation, largest among the more than 3,000
reporters and other newspeople registered. Other n the 16-member Common
Council,
was censured by his colleagues June 29 for the threats and for the
sausage scare, in which he told newspapers an underground black
militant group had injected rat poison into products from Usinger's
Famous Sausage Inc.
   The warning forced the family-owned business in downtown
Milwaukee to recall and destroy nearly 38,000 pounds of meat, at a
cost of more than $135,000. An investigation found none of the meat
was tainted.
   Before the sausage incident, McGee had picketed Usinger's when
the owner opposed renaming a street in front of its retail outlet
after slain civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
   McGee complained in his letter Monday that police protection has
been limited ``by all the fun Milwaukee is having this year.''
   The reference was to the city's annual Summerfest, an 11-day
lakefront festival that ended over the weekend after drawing nearly
900,000 visitors. The festival requires a large police presence at
the lakefront.
   ``White people's fun is more important than black lives,'' McGee
said.
   A crime wave has been sweeping Milwaukee's black community.
Seventy-three murders have been committed in the city this year,
compared to 58 by this time last year, when a new murder record was
set.

   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald
Riegle, D-Mich., was the top congressional recipient of campaign
donations linked to the troubled Columbia Savings and Loan, an
independent watchdog group said Monday.
   Common Cause reported that Riegle received $29,000 from
individuals associated with the thrift's political action committee
between January 1981 and last April. He was a member of the banking
panel during that time and became chairman last year.
   Columbia executives, their spouses and the PAC contributed a
total of $284,900 to congressional incumbents and challengers
during the nearly decade-long period examined by Common Cause, the
report said.
   The federal Office of Thrift Supervision last week filed civil
charges of violating banking regulations against Thomas Spiegel,
the thrift's former chief executive.
   Aside from Riegle, 51 congressional candidates _ including 38
incumbents _ received donations from people associated with
Columbia Savings and Loan and its PAC.
   Spiegel's nearly-insolvent institution was the thrift industry's
biggest purchaser of risky, high-yield junk bonds. The government
is seeking $24 million from Spiegel, who is accused of squandering
depositors' money on personal expenses such as wine-tasting
classes, rock concerts and $100,000 worth of firearms.
   Riegle is among five senators under investigation by the ethics
committee for intervening with federal regulators on behalf of
Charles Keating, another S&amp;L executive. The government seized his
insolvent Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif., last year.
That bailout alone is expected to cost taxpayers up to $2 billion.
   Keating and associates contributed $78,250 to Riegle's 1988
re-election campaign. Riegle later returned the money.
   Riegle spokeswoman Martha Quinn said the senator had received
$6.2 million from more than 10,000 contributors during the last
decade.
   ``As the new chairman of the Banking Committee in 1989, Sen.
Riegle led the effort in Congress to crack down on the savings and
loan industry and enact the toughest financial regulation bill in
50 years,'' Ms. Quinn said. ``It did stop once and for all the
abuses carried out by the savings and loans.''
   Columbia S&amp;L was the institution hit hardest by the bill Riegle
sponsored, Ms. Quinn said.
   Spiegel was the thrift's top campaign contributor, personally
giving $50,150 to congressional candidates from 1981 to April of
this year, the Common Cause report said. Riegle received $2,000
from Spiegel.
   The leading recipient of money from Spiegel was former Banking
Committee chairman Fernand St Germain, D-R.I., who received $3,500.
He was defeated for re-election in 1988.
   Other leading recipients included Sens. Jake Garn, R-Utah,
$25,200; Tim Wirth, D-Colo., $17,500; Bob Packwood, R-Ore.,
$17,000; Pete Wilson, R-Calif., $15,500; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
$13,500; Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, $11,000; Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., $7,000.
   Top House recipients included Reps. Howard Berman, D-Calif.,
$5,000; Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., $4,000; Carroll Hubbard, D-Ky.,
$4,000; Barney Frank, D-Mass., $3,000; Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga.,
$2,000.

   A woman who police said craved
attention held seven people hostage in a bank Monday, claiming she
was armed with a hand grenade and gun during a four-hour standoff.
   The hostages escaped at about 4 p.m. after a police SWAT team
distracted the woman, identified as 37-year-old Vicki Molina.
   She was arrested and no explosives or weapons were found, police
said.
   ``When the negotiators and these tactical people started to move
in she became distracted,'' said Metro-Dade police spokesman
William Kinnebrew. ``Most of the hostages ran toward the tactical
people. They got them out to safety and then were able to go in and
subdue this woman and take her into custody.''
   No shots were fired and no one was injured. Ms. Molina was
charged with nine counts of false imprisonment and jailed under a
suicide watch, said Police Lt. Nancy McCue.
   The ordeal began after the visibly nervous woman entered the
NCNB Corp. branch shortly before noon. After a few minutes, she
handed an employee a note, then ordered an undetermined number of
people to leave the bank, said Metro-Dade Officer Ralph Hernandez.
   ``She said she wanted attention,'' said McCue.
   The woman allowed several calls to be made by hostages,
including one to North Miami police informing them she did not
intend to rob the bank, she said.
   Ms. Molina's husband told police she has been in and out of
psychiatric treatment for 15 years. She was chain-smoking and kept
her hand in her purse during much of the standoff. At one point,
she tried to cut her hair with a pair of scissors, McCue said.
   ``Apparently she was trying to prove a point to someone,'' McCue
said. ``We don't know who at this time.''
   The woman said that before entering the bank she had ``taken
care of everything,'' including giving away her dog, said McCue.
   Police contacted the woman by telephone about 3 p.m. and began
negotiations, said Deputy Chief Larry Juriga.
   The FBI and a SWAT team from the Metro-Dade Police Department
were called to the scene, in the small town's main business
district, and police blocked off a half-mile area around the bank.
   Relatives of the bank hostages were taken into another bank
across the street to wait out the standoff.

<TEXT>
   The International Federation of Newspaper
Publishers called Monday for the immediate release of a Kenyan
journalist who was detained last week in a crackdown on government
opponents.
   Police took Gibotu Imanyara, editor of the Nairobi Law Monthly,
from his home Thursday evening, and neither his family nor
colleagues know where he is being held, the newspaper publishers
organization said.
   ``It is clear that Mr. Imanyara has been arrested as a result of
his journalistic activities and the principled stance he and his
publication have taken in favor of the protection of constitutional
guarantees and, among them, the guarantee of press freedom,'' the
federation said in a message to Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.
   The federation called for the immediate release of Imanyara as
well as ``all those detained for the peaceful exercise of their
right to freedom of expression.''
   The Nairobi Law Monthly, founded in 1987, has carried outspoken
criticism of the government and its human rights record.
   Imanyara, 36, has been jailed twice before and spent two years
in solitary confinement before establishing the publication, the
federation said.
   At least eight people have been reported killed in rioting the
past three days after police broke up a pro-democracy rally in
Nairobi.
   The violence follows last week's detentions of Imanyara and
other prominent advocates of a multiparty system.

<TEXT>
   Researchers are warning insulin-taking diabetics
to quit smoking, citing discoveries that tobacco use greatly
increases their risk of death.
   The researchers studied more than 500 patients in what is
believed to be the first look at the ill effects of smoking in
insulin-dependent diabetics. The study's results were published in
the July issue of the journal Circulation, published by the
Dallas-based American Heart Association.
   Claudia Moy and colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh and
Children's Hospital said the risk of premature death for
insulin-dependent women is more than twice that of diabetic females
who don't smoke. The researchers said diabetes increases the risk
of death 10-fold, meaning insulin-using women who are heavy smokers
are 20 times more likely to die prematurely than the general
population.
   The risk of premature death among diabetic men who smoke heavily
is about 10 times greater than the general population, according to
the study. Non-smoking diabetics run a risk about six times higher
than normal men.

   The Communist Party congress voted Monday to
require the Politburo to include the general secretary, his deputy
and the first secretaries of the Soviet Union's 15 republics.
   The 15 republic party chiefs include Givi Gumbaridze of Georgia,
whose republic is pushing for independence from the Soviet Union,
and Pyotr Luchinsky of Moldavia and Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan,
whose republics have declared themselves sovereign with the right
to overturn national laws. Nursultan Nazarbaev of Kazakhstan has
spoken in favor of some limited sovereignty.
   Ayaz N. Mutalibov of Azerbaijan leads a republic that has been
under martial law for six months, since ethnic rioting that turned
into what Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov said was a revolt
against Soviet power.
   Ivan Polozkov of Russia and Efrem Sokolov of Byelorussia are
conservatives who would counterbalance reformers.
   The Communist Parties of Lithuania and Latvia have split, and
their most progressive members chose to form separate independent
parties.
   The conservative branches loyal to Moscow have representatives
at this congress, indicating it is their first secretaries who are
likely to sit on the Politburo. They are Alfreds Rubiks of Latvia
and Nicolas Burakevicius of Lithuania.
   The Estonian Communist Party plans to split next fall. The
independent faction is led by chairman Vaino Vyalyas and first
secretary Enn Arno Sillari, while the loyalist faction is led by
Alexander Gusev, according to the Estonian News Agency. Both
Estonian factions are represented at the congress.
   The other republic party chiefs are Vladimir Movsisyan of
Armenia, Stanislav Gurenko of Ukraine, Sappar Niyazov of Turkmenia,
Kakhar Makhkamov of Tadjikistan and Absomat Masaliyev of Kirgizia.

<TEXT>
   Israel's second experimental satellite
disintegrated on re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere on Monday, 97
days after it was launched, officials said.
   The 352-pound Ofek-2 satellite was launched April 3 amid
speculation it was part of a program to spy on Israel's Arab
enemies.
   Israeli leaders denied this was the purpose but also bragged the
launch showed Israel's scientific and military superiority over
Arab states.
   Ofek-2 was launched a day after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
threatened to react to any Israeli assault on his country with a
chemical attack that would destroy half the Jewish state.
   The satellite's orbit ranged from 130 miles at its lowest point
to 923 miles at its highest, according to a statement from Israel
Aircraft Industries, which developed the satellite.
   It did not say where the re-entry occurred.
   Ofek-2, Hebrew for Horizon-2, stayed in orbit about 40 days
longer than expected ``due to the large reduction in the actual
solar activity compared to the forecast,'' the statement said.
   It termed the flight ``an unqualified success.''
   Ofek-1 was launched on Sept. 19, 1988, and stayed in space 115
days. Israeli officals had said Ofek-2 would not stay in space as
long as its predecessor.
   Ofek-2 was more advanced because it was capable of two-way
communication with its earth base, scientists said.
   According to official reports, Israel is expected to launch a
third test satellite in 1992 and eventually put in orbit a
communications satellite with 10-year lifespan. Israeli scientists
have developed a prototype of a communications satellite called the
Amos.

<TEXT>
   An Arkansas abortion rights group
offered Monday to arrange car pools for Louisiana women seeking
abortions should the restrictive bill passed by that state's
Legislature become law.
   ``Should the legislation in Louisiana be signed into law, we
will be available to assist them _ whether it's caravans or
whatever,'' said Kimberly Collins, chairwoman of the Committee for
Reproductive Choice. ``We will certainly find a way to help those
women.''
   She said the group also would buy advertising space in
newspapers promoting the availability of abortions in Arkansas.
   Louisiana lawmakers Sunday passed a measure that would ban most
abortions and punish doctors who perform them with up to 10 years
at hard labor.
   The law includes provisions demanded by Gov. Buddy Roemer to
exempt most victims of rape and incest, but he said won't act on it
until he had read the bill carefully.
   Abortions are legal in Arkansas, although a constitutional
amendment narrowly approved in 1988 makes it illegal to spend
public funds on abortions, except to save the mother's life. That
amendment also makes the protection of unborn children state policy.
   A 1989 law requires women under the age of 18 to notify both
parents should they seek an abortion. Minors can avoid notification
of their parents if they convince a probate judge they have good
reason to get the abortion without notifying their parents.

   Dapper dressing may help you get ahead,
but a necktie tied too tightly can make your head swim and blur
vision, says the author of a book on improving health habits.
   Viselike ties can constrict blood flow to the brain and sensory
organs, says Dr. Don R. Powell of the American Institute for
Preventive Medicine.
   He cited 1989 research at Cornell University for the necktie
tip, one of 365 suggestions in his book, ``A Year of Health Hints.''
   ``It can be a problem for people who have to use their eyes in
an important way,'' Powell said Monday, noting that computer
operators, pilots and surgeons depend on clear vision.
   Powell suggested buying shirts a half-size bigger in the neck,
leaving the top button undone, tying knots loosely and loosening
the tie throughout the day.
   He also said ``casual days'' at work, when a tie isn't
necessary, would help alleviate the problem and boost morale. He
said the institute has ``casual Mondays'' and ``casual weeks,'' and
is discussing ``casual summers.''
   ``Not having to put on a necktie and a suit seemed to improve
morale,'' he said.

   With all the mysterious phone calls
and misguided mail over 50 years, the Frank William Boumas of this
town knew someone shared their name.
   But when the two Frank William Boumas finally met about ten
years ago, they found the name was but one of many coincidences.
   They first met at the Kent County International Airport because
of a ticket mixup: they were booked to Florida on the same airline
the same day.
   In conversation, they learned each had married on July 9. On
Monday, Frank and Trudy Bouma celebrated their 50th wedding
anniversary; Frank and Nella Bouma celebrated their 55th.
   ``We tried to get our anniversary picture in the newspaper five
years ago, but they must have looked at the name and thought it was
a duplicate picture. The only one that got printed was Frank and
Nella's,'' said Trudy Bouma.
   After Frank and Trudy returned from their honeymoon, they read
in the newspaper that the other Frank William Bouma had fathered a
child.
   ``We hoped people didn't get the wrong impression from that,''
Trudy said. ``We weren't married nearly long enough to have a
baby.''
   The next year Frank and Trudy had a daughter, whom they named
Marcia. They did not learn until much later that Frank and Nella
also have a daughter named Marcia.
   The uncanny name game not only goes forward a generation, but
back one. The two Frank's fathers are both named Fred.

   With a 21-gun salute, a flourish of trumpets and
a steady flow of high-powered air-conditioning, President Bush
formally opened Monday what he dubbed the first ``post-postwar''
economic summit.
   After a weekend of rodeo and down-home Texas hospitality, Bush
welcomed the other foreign leaders on the picturebook campus of
Rice University where the Academic Quadrangle proved a good staging
ground for a full-dress military welcome.
   But a lot of people were thinking at least as much about the
weather _ temperatures in the mid-90s and humidity topping 80
percent.
   With the heat in mind, the welcoming ceremony was held to 10
minutes, from the time the leaders stepped into the quadrangle
until they retreated inside Lovett Hall.
   And in an effort to make even those few minutes more bearable,
the outdoor reviewing stand they stood on had a three-ton air
conditioner spewing cold air up from vents at their feet. A white
canopy overhead also shielded the leaders from the broiling sun.
   Offstage, the sweat poured off the faces of less fortunate
summit aides and the military color guard.
   Bush, the transplanted New Englander who now calls Houston his
hometown, said, ``We think this city is a very appropriate place to
host this economic summit.'' As Cold War tensions continue to
recede, he called the gathering the first ``not of the postwar era,
but of the post-postwar era.''
   ``A new world of freedom lays before us,'' Bush told the leaders
of Great Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada
before they went inside to begin their deliberations in private.
   Bush urged his fellow presidents and prime ministers ``to work
toward decisions here in Houston that will bring new stability and
prosperity to the world.''
   The president and his wife Barbara personally greeted each
leader upon arrival on the campus. After meeting each motorcade,
they waited inside before venturing out again in the heat.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who had to walk
gingerly amid the dirt and hay at Sunday night's rodeo, was
overheard telling her host, ``Last night was fabulous!''
   The leaders finished their first round of talks early and,
emerging back out in the heat, walked down a long red carpet to
pose for their traditional class photo.
   ``We had very good discussions,'' said Bush, who playfully waved
behind his back to photographers as the leaders turned to walk away.
   Later, they were reassembling to talk politics over a working
dinner at the Bayou Bend, a mansion-turned-museum where the summit
fare included tortilla soup, grilled red snapper and blackberry
peach swirl ice cream.
   Bush began his day in separate talks with French President
Francois Mitterrand and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who are
leading the push against Bush's resistance for direct Western aid
to bolster the staggering Soviet economy.
   Bush met first with Mitterrand to give Kohl a little more time
to rest from his long overnight flight to Houston from the World
Cup finals in Rome, where Kohl witnessed West Germany's triumph
over Argentina on Sunday.
   Mitterrand also flew in early Monday morning, but his was a less
time-consuming trip aboard the supersonic Concorde.
   Bush and Mitterrand both resisted reporters' efforts to draw
them out on the potential squabble over Soviet aid. ``I'm defending
his right not to take questions at photo opportunities,'' said Bush.
   As soon as Mitterrand left the Houstonian hotel after his
meeting with Bush, the French tricolor flag was replaced on the
wall of the Houstonian's Manor House with the black-red-and-gold
banner of West Germany in readiness for Kohl's arrival.
   Bush greeted the chancellor with a jaunty thumbs-up, saying,
``Willkommen! Hail the champions of football. ... World champions!
It's a big win for Germany.''
   Inside, Bush boasted that he had played soccer himself on a
championship team at Yale in the 1940s, and Kohl said Bush would
get to inaugurate the next World Cup games, which will be played in
the United States in 1994.
   ``Either as an unemployed person or as president,'' Bush quipped.

<TEXT>
   The first of more than 5,000
Albanians who rushed foreign embassies in Tirana in a desperate bid
to emigrate arrived in Prague early Tuesday aboard the personal
plane of Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel.
   In the Albanian capital, a U.N. envoy was trying to negotiate
safe passage abroad for the thousands stranded in their flight from
Europe's last bastion of hard-line Communism.
   Havel sent his Soviet-built TU-154 to Tirana and it arrived back
at about 1:15 a.m. carrying 51 Albanians who sought asylum in the
Czechoslovak Embassy.
   The beaming occupants, all adults, yelled ``Long live Havel!''
before being whisked away on buses to dormitories in an outlying
district of Prague.
   Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier told reporters at the capital's
airport that Czechoslovakia got the refugees out first due to ``a
little luck and a lot of patience.''
   He said most of the group wanted to emigrate to the United
States, but that in any event, ``we're not going to send them
back.''
   In a brief dispatch, Albania's state ATA news agency had
announced that the group left shortly before midnight Monday.
   ATA said ``a group of Albanian citizens, sheltering in the
Czechoslovak Embassy, left for Prague with regular documents.''
   Although Albanian authorities agreed Saturday to permit all the
Albanian asylum-seekers to leave under foreign supervision, the
process of providing them with travel documents and transportation
was expected to take days.
   Albanian authorities continued on Monday to refuse aid shipments
for the would-be-emigres packed in Western embassies.
   The Austria Press Agency reported from Tirana that 2.5 tons of
supplies destined for the West German and French embassies were
flown out on the same Swissair plane they came on because
authorities did not permit unloading.
   About 3,000 Albanians seeking asylum were jammed behind the
gates of the West German Embassy.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher promised that ``those
Albanians wishing to come to Germany will be welcomed,'' the
ministry said in Bonn.
   About 1,000 Albanians were in the Italian Embassy.
   The refugees overwhelmed the missions, which have been unable to
provide sufficient food and water. Sanitary conditions were bad.
Genscher termed the situation ``intolerable.''
   One refugee gave birth to a girl in the West German compound
over the weekend, the Germans said.
   The shaken Albanian leadership announced more government changes
on Monday, an apparent attempt to reduce public dissatisfaction
over shortages of food and other consumer items in that nation of
3.2 million people.
   The Albanian parliament fired Jovan Bardhi, the minister in
charge of food production, and Vita Kapo, minister of light
industry, and reassigned ministers of public services and home
trade, ATA reported.
   The changes followed the replacement of the minister of police
and the minister of war on Sunday.
   ATA also announced wage reforms that will result in more wage
differentiation and said unemployment benefits would be paid to
workers idled through no fault of their own.
   Many of the more than 5,000 Albanians crowding foreign embassies
have said they seek a better economic life abroad.
   A spokesman at the Foreign ministry in Budapest, Gyoergy Lukacs,
said six of the 40 Albanians at the Hungarian Embassy expressed a
desire to settle in Hungary. Most wanted to go to the United
States, he said.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
he had no information about requests to travel to the United States
and no comment on what U.S. policy would be toward such requests.
There is no U.S. Embassy in Tirana.
   In Paris, the Foreign Ministry said the formalities of obtaining
passports for the 550 refugees at its embassy in Tirana were moving
along rapidly, and ``we hope they will be finished by the end of
the day.''
   The asylum-seekers, some dodging police bullets, began taking
refuge on June 28. Albanian authorities pledged Saturday that those
seeking to emigrate would receive travel papers.
   Hanns Schumacher, spokesman for the West German Foreign
Ministry, said in Bonn that a U.N. envoy was representing the West
German, Italian, French and Greek embassies in talks with the
Albanian government.
   About 30 Albanians were in the Greek Embassy.
   Albania's Communist leader, Ramiz Alia, has begun this year to
institute some cautious economic reforms in an attempt to alleviate
shortages and raise the standard of living by creating incentives
for workers and farmers.
   For 45 years, travel for average Albanians has been virtually
impossible. But since the death of President Enver Hoxha in 1985,
Albanian leaders have sought better ties abroad and in the last
year began to implement reforms. Albania this year has been seeking
better relations with the outside world.
   New regulations that took effect Tuesday entitled all Albanians
over age 16 to own a passport.
   Police sealed off Tirana's embassy row on Sunday to prevent more
Albanians from taking refuge, but some appeared to be getting
through.
   In Warsaw, the Polish Foreign Ministry reported 51 Albanians at
its embassy, compared to 46 Sunday.

Death Penalty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lawyers for a man accused of killing
seven people in a 1988 shooting rampage at a Sunnyvale defense
company moved Monday to block prosecutors from seeking the death
penalty.
   It was the first day of trial for Richard Farley, who faces
seven counts of first-degree murder and three counts of attempted
murder stemming from the February 1988 massacre at ESL Inc.
   Farley is accused of entering the Sunnyvale office draped with
guns and ammunition and going on a shooting spree because a
co-worker, engineer Laura Black, had refused a date with him.
   Public Defender Gregory Paraskou argued that the refusal of the
U.S. government and ESL Inc. to turn over information on Farley's
work history would hurt the defense and jeopardize the penalty
phase of the upcoming trial if Farley is convicted.
   Prosecutor Alan Nudleman argued that the defense already had
been given ``voluminous'' amounts of information on Farley's work.
   Santa Clara County Superior Judge Joseph Biafore issued a gag
order that bars lawyers from discussing the trial with news
reporters.
   Biafore also said he would take Paraskou's arguments under
submission and review the documents in question before issuing a
ruling.
   Farley allegedly told police negotiators he only wounded Black
so she would survive and regret what she had done. Black had
obtained a court order against Farley because she said he had been
constantly bothering her.
   Farley surrendered at the shooting scene after long telephone
negotiations with police.

   Standing apart from its summit partners, the Bush
administration on Monday renewed its opposition to any concrete
guide for reducing pollutants blamed for warming the earth's
atmosphere.
   Shortly before the seven-nation summit formally opened, White
House hief of Staff John Sununu reiterated American worries that
efforts to sharply curtail polluting emissions would hamper
economic growth.
   The administration is concerned that it is being asked for ``in
essence a perpetual stabilization'' in energy use, Sununu said at a
news conference.
   ``Continued economic growth ... requires that you continue to
use energy, and that any growth at all then would not be
permitted,'' he said.
   A discussion of environmental issues was on the agenda for the
summit meeting of President Bush and the leaders of Britain,
Canada, France, West Germany, Italy and Japan.
   At the end of their talks Wednesday, the leaders will release a
final statement expected to include endorsement of a 93-nation
accord that in turn calls for getting rid of chlorofluorocarbons,
which deplete the earth's protective ozone layer, by the end of the
decade.
   The United States, though, has been isolated from its European
allies in a go-slow policy on curbing carbon dioxide and other
pollutants blamed for warming the global environment.
   Several European countries intend to reduce or stabilize carbon
dioxide emissions by the year 2000 or 2005. But Bush argues more
research needs to be carried out before such dramatic measures are
adopted.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in an opening statement to
his counterparts, said, ``A lack of scientific knowledge about the
causes and effect cannot justify slowing down the taking of
concrete measures.''
   He said decisive steps must be taken to reduce the greenhouse
effect and urged immediate action to stop the destruction of rain
forests.
   ``The Houston summit,'' he said, ``should give a clear and
concrete signal for the effective protection of mankind and
environment.''
   In advance of the summit, officials said the Europeans appeared
willing to ease their previous insistence that specific reduction
goals be set at the summit. Led by Germany, some had wanted
agreement to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions or reduce them by
up to 25 percent by the end of the decade.
   Sununu, in an interview on ABC, took a swipe at the United
States' critics on the other side of the Atlantic.
   ``I think West Germany got a lot of good grades for rhetoric,''
he said.
   ``If you take a good look at what the United States has actually
done in terms of cleaning up our environment ... I don't think the
United States has to take a back seat to anyone,'' he said.
   But the Wilderness Society, a private American environmental
group, shot back: ``The U.S. gets a failing grade, no matter how
... Sununu tries to rejigger the numbers.''
   On Sunday, environmentalists denounced what they said was the
failure of the summit nations to meet the aims of last year's Paris
summit, during which they promised to protect the world's
environment.
   Sununu told reporters the United States wanted ``a commitment
... that would allow both the industrialized countries and the
developing countries to address the broad issue of greenhouse gases
without picking them one by one and setting caps on them
individually.''
   ``What we have proposed constantly is to address them in the
broad context and let each country take into account its own
particular structure,'' he said.
   In addition to global warming, summit participants are expected
to discuss ways to curtail the destruction of tropical forests and
whether to create an international ``green fund'' to help
developing countries protect their environments.
   Kohl told Bush he wanted the summit to support help for Brazil
in its fight to save its rain forests from destruction, said
spokesman Hans Klein. Kohl and Bush met privately Monday morning
before the summit began.
   Environmentalists from Eastern Europe appealed to the summit
leaders at a news conference Monday to help their countries clean
up.
   ``In the past, money was pumped into the government without
economic or environmental concern,'' said Zbigniew Bochniarz, a
member of the Polish Ecology Club. ``Now we must create a new
approach and build conditions that will modernize outdated
pollution standards.''

   Leaders of the six East African
nations on Monday signed an unprecedented peace pact to end
conflicts in their region.
   The signing followed urgings by President Mengistu Haile Mariam
of embattled Ethiopia that the African heads of state follow the
lead of superpowers and try to defuse confrontations through
negotiations.
   The pact committed Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and
Uganda to seek peaceful means to end regional conflicts.
   ``Peoples and governments in various parts of the world which
had been locked in antagonism are now making efforts to resolve
their differences through peaceful negotiations, '' Mengistu said.
   ``With the phasing out of the Cold War the peoples of the world
have begun to breathe the air of peace.''
   Mengistu's government is engaged in what he has termed ``life
and death'' struggles with two separate insurgencies in Eritrea and
Tigre provinces.
   Sudan, Somalia and Uganda are trying to contain long-running
insurgencies and the six nations that signed the pact have at one
time or other accused each other of harboring and aiding their
opponents.
   The accord was signed by Mengistu; presidents Hassan Gouled
Aptidon of Djibouti, Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Maj. Gen. Omar
Hassan El Bashir of Sudan and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, and by
Somalia Prime Minister Ali Samantar.
   The six met hours before the opening of the 26th annual summit
of the heads of state of the 51-member Organization of African
Unity in the Ethiopian capital.
   The OAU summit is expected to focus on issues ranging from
mounting popular calls for multiparty democracy to the mountains of
foreign debt.
   Mengistu's government held fruitless peace talks late last year
with Ethiopia's two guerrilla groups each of which has intensified
its efforts to topple him.
   One group has been fighting 29 years, seeking independence for
Ethiopia's northernmost province, Eritrea, and Mengistu has not
softened his objection to the secession.
   He did not mention his troubles at home, but observed that
unification had become a current byword with mergers of the two
Yemens and East and West Germany.
   ``Furthermore, the countries of Western Europe through the
European Community are taking historic steps towards integration
and, by developing closer ties in all fields with East European
countries, are moving toward making Europe for the first time in
its history, a continent of peace and cooperation,'' Mengistu
declared.

   Ramon Salcido, the winery worker
charged with the bloody slayings of his wife, two daughters and
four other people, lost a bid Monday for a two-month delay of his
trial.
   Sonoma County Public Defender Marteen Miller had sought to stall
the trial until September. But after a 40-minute private discussion
with lawyers, Superior Court Judge Reginald Littrell said jury
selection would start next Monday.
   Salcido, 29, is accused of murdering his wife, two of their
three daughters, two of his wife's sisters, his mother-in-law and a
co-worker 15 months ago in the wine country of Sonoma County, north
of San Francisco.
   Miller had said he also planned to ask for a second change of
venue, but did not make a formal request Monday. The trial was
moved to San Mateo County, south of San Francisco, because of heavy
news coverage.
   Miller and the prosecutors agreed on a list of 97 questions for
potential jurors. Many deal with the jurors' frame of mind
regarding the death penalty _ the expected focus of the Salcido
trial.
   Jury selection is expected to take at least six weeks with 500
prospective jurors called for possible selection.
   Miller said he plans to agree to most of the evidence against
his client, who submitted a full confession to police, but said he
would fight the death penalty.
   ``I want to keep my client alive,'' Miller said outside the
courtroom.
   Miller and Prosecutor Peter Bumerts clashed repeatedly in court.
   At one point, Miller stood, jabbing the air as he argued for a
delay in the trial.
   ``A man's life is at stake,'' he pleaded.
   ``If Mr. Salcido had had the same consideration for the seven
people he killed, maybe we wouldn't be here,'' countered Bumerts.
   Authorities say Salcido began his murderous rampage after a
night of drugs and drinking, because he thought his wife, Angela,
was unfaithful and that he was not the father of the couple's
eldest daughter.
   Contributing to his anger, they believe, was a court order to
make back child-support payments to his first wife, a woman Angela
was not aware of until the order arrived at their home. Salcido has
a daughter by his first wife.
   Salcido was arrested in his native Mexico a few days after the
slayings. Sonoma County Sheriff's detectives said he confessed on
the return trip to California.
   According to the detective, Salcido gave this account of the
rampage:
   He took daughters Theresa, 1, Sofia, 4, and Carmina, 3, to the
county dump and cut their throats; Carmina alone survived. Then
Salcido drove to his in-laws' house, where he knocked out and
stabbed to death his mother-in-law Marion Louise Richards and cut
the throats of her daughters, 12-year-old Ruth and 8-year-old Marie.
   Salcido returned home, beat his wife and shot her with a
.22-caliber pistol. He next drove to the Grand Cru Winery where he
worked, and shot and killed co-worker Tracey Toovey, 35. Then he
shot and wounded a second co-worker, Ken Butti, 33, at Butti's home.
   Salcido was charged with seven counts of murder and three counts
of attempted murder. One of the attempted murder counts stems from
his allegedly pointing a gun at Butti's wife, Terri.
   Miller has said he will argue that his client had an organic
brain dysfunction and was suffering from ``psychotic depression''
at the time of the slayings.

<HEAD>Catholic Official Says Brazil Fails to Halt Genocide of Indians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic church official
assailed President Fernando Collor de Mello on Monday, saying he
failed to halt the destruction of the Yanomani Indians, one of the
world's largest remaining primitive tribes.
   ``The Yanomani genocide and violence against indigenous peoples
continues ...,'' said Antonio Brand, secretary of the Catholic
Church's official Indian Council. ``The Indians are tired of
declarations that don't bring change.''
   Collor, who took office in March, has vowed to defend Indian
rights. In April, he ordered the destruction of clandestine landing
strips on Yanomani lands that are used by Amazon gold miners.
   The Yanomani live on Brazil's northwest frontier with Venezuela.
Thousands of miners invaded their territory after large reserves of
gold, diamonds and other minerals were found there in 1987.
   Brand dismissed the dynamiting of the landing strips as ``a
publicity stunt.''
   ``Only 14 of over 100 strips were destroyed and the majority
have already been recovered (by the miners),'' he said.
   Brand said the church's Indian Council wants the government to
remove all gold miners from the region and revoke decrees issued by
former President Jose Sarney's government which created mining
reserves on Yanomani territory.
   ``The negligence of Collor's government in the face of this
problem makes it co-responsible for the Yanomani genocide,'' he
said.
   He said the Yanomani's situation was rapidly worsening, and
medical care and food supplies were desperately needed.
   Miners have disrupted the Yanomani's hunting and fishing,
polluted rivers with mercury used to clean gold, and brought
diseases previously unknown to the indians.
   Many tribes have been hard hit by malnutrition, venereal
diseases and malaria introduced by the outsiders. Other
tribespeople have died in clashes with miners.
   Brand said 15 percent of the Yanomani population, estimated at
9,000, ``has disappeared in less than three years.''

<TEXT>
   The leader of a pro-Cuban guerrilla group and
at least 39 other suspected leftist rebels escaped early Monday
from a maximum-security prison by crawling through a 660-foot
tunnel, officials said.
   Corrections department director Victor Miranda identified Victor
Polay, head of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, or MRTA, as
among those who escaped the Miguel Castro prison on the
northeastern outskirts of this capital.
   Miranda said 39 male and nine female members of MRTA fled, while
President Alan Garcia said 40 rebels escaped. The different figures
could not immediately be reconciled.
   The breakout occurred about 3 a.m. in a facility that is
considered the country's highest security prison and houses
hundreds of suspected communist rebels.
   Government prosecutor Maria Astete said police found two
submachine guns, a walkie-talkie and four booby-trap bombs in the
block-and-a-half-long tunnel.
   Ms. Astete also said five hooded gunmen held up a bank at midday
in a northern suburb, killing a guard and making off with
45,000,000 Peruvian intis, about $450. She said police believed the
five to be among the escapees.
   Police captured Polay on Feb. 3, 1989, in the highland city of
Huancayo, 120 miles east of Lima. His capture was considered a
serious blow to the pro-Cuban MRTA, which began fighting Peru's
elected government in 1984.
   The Shining Path group that operates primarily in the Peruvian
highlands is considered the largest and most dangerous of the two
anti-government organizations fighting President Garcia.
   Polay, 38, was facing terrorism charges and was to be sentenced
within weeks after a highly publicized trial. The government
prosecutor was recommending a 15-year sentence.
   Before taking up arms, Polay was a student leader of the
center-left Aprista Party in the late 1960s. He studied with
Garcia, current leader of the Aprista Party, in Spain in the early
1970s.
   The MRTA is believed to number about 1,000 combatants and
operates mostly in Peru's northern and eastern jungles. It also
carries out occasional bombings against banks, embassies, and
government buildings in the capital.
   Its most spectacular action to date was the assassination in
January of former Defense Minister Gen. Enrique Lopez. Lopez was
gunned down in broad daylight by three men near his office in a
fashionable Lima suburb.
   Speaking to reporters, Garcia blamed the prison guards, who he
said shared responsibility for the breakout.
   Garcia said that despite the dramatic escape the guerrillas were
losing their fight against the government.
   ``I reiterate that terrorism in Peru is in retreat,'' Garcia
said. ``They have had 10 years and have not achieved anything.''
   Hugo Otero, adviser to Garcia, told The Associated Press the
president canceled appointments for the day because of the breakout.
   Officials did not say how the escape was engineered, but sources
in the Interior ministry, who asked not to be named, said given the
high number that escaped they may have gotten inside help.
   Prison workers have been on strike for months demanding higher
pay. Corrections department officials said striking workers had
been replaced by temporary workers.
   Police said they had closed off roads leading from the city and
detained more than 2,000 people throughout the metropolitan area
who were not carrying documents.
   On May 14, a column of 300 MRTA rebels seized the northern
jungle town of Saposoa, freeing 35 suspected guerrillas from the
town's jail and robbing three banks.
   The MRTA takes its name from an 18th century mestizo, or mixed
blood revolutionary who led a peasant revolt against Spanish
colonial rule in the Andes.
   It is smaller and less radical than the Maoist Shining Path
guerrilla group, which has been fighting since 1980. The government
says more than 18,500 people have died in the decade of political
violence, including police, soldiers, rebels, government officials
and civilians.

   East German officials have
discovered what they said were two mass graves of people executed
by Soviet secret police, the East German news agency ADN reported
Monday.
   The discovery on the site of a former Nazi concentration camp
was the latest in disclosures on alleged atrocities committed by
the Soviet occupiers who directly ran what is now East Germany
until 1949.
   ADN did not say what evidence existed to assume the victims were
executed by the Soviets rather than by Nazi troops.
   The Nazis set up the forced labor camp on Berlin's northern
outskirts in 1936. More than half its 200,000 inmates died of
execution, starvation or disease before the Red Army captured the
camp and interned Nazis and Nazi sympathizers there.
   Investigation into purported atrocities followed the ouster of
East Germany's hard-line communist leadership last fall.

<HEAD>Former Hostage Says Captors Poisoned Him With Arsenic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air Force doctors informed former hostage Frank
Reed that his captors poisoned him with arsenic during his 44
months in captivity, the former hostage said Monday.
   Reed also said that hostage Brian Keenan's sister had told him
in a telephone conversation from Belfast, Northern Ireland, that
negotiations toward the Irish educator's release were ``50 percent
finished.''
   ``I think it's the most wonderful news I've heard since I've
been home,'' Reed said of Keenan's possible release. ``Brian and I
were mates in the holes, the hideouts. Brian on several occasions
tried to intervene to try to stop the beatings that were going on.''
   A Shiite source in Beirut, Lebanon, said Iran was pushing hard
for the release of a hostage in appreciation for aid it received
after the devastating June 21 earthquake.
   The Irish Red Cross flew the first Western relief plane into
Tehran after the earthquake, in which 40,000 people were killed.
   Based on hair and nail samples, Air Force and Justice Department
officials believe Reed, 57, was given arsenic over a long period of
time and one large dose shortly before he was released April 30,
Reed told Boston television station WHDH.
   The news made Reed wonder if Keenan may also have been given
arsenic.
   ``Brian was exhibiting the same symptoms that I had of arsenic
poisoning, so let us hope that it hasn't been too severe. Brian and
I got in a little trouble over there together and maybe they were
giving it to him for the same reasons,'' he said.
   Reed speculated that the captors' goal may have been to subdue
the hostages or to make them appear sickly in order to speed
negotiations.
   Exposure to high levels of arsenic can produce a burning pain in
the esophagus and stomach, vomiting, diarrhea and depression.
Prolonged exposure can lead to a rapid, feeble pulse and
circulatory collapse.
   Traces of arsenic are present in water and food, especially
seafood.
   A spokesman at the Malcolm Grow Medical Center on Andrews Air
Force Base in Maryland said Reed was released from the hospital on
Friday. Neither Reed, the Justice Department nor medical personnel
on the base could be reached for comment late Monday.
   The hospital reported last month that tests on Reed had found
arsenic, but gave no indication of deliberate poisoning.
   Hostages held in the Middle East include six Americans, four
Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian.
The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Keenan was taken hostage April 11, 1986.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Border Patrol arrested a
record 947 alleged illegal immigrants in a weekend raid, and
officials said Monday that arrests of aliens are up more than 40
percent over last year.
   ``The thing that this illustrates is the volume of illegal alien
traffic that we are dealing with down here,'' said Ted Swofford,
the Border Patrol's supervising patrol agent for the San Diego
sector.
   This and other raids also indicate that illegal immigrants are
coming across the border steadily throughout the year and that jobs
other than seasonal farm work are luring them, he said.
   ``It's just gradually increasing. The seasonal fluctuations have
evened out,'' Swofford said.
   Arrests of illegal immigrants are running 40 percent to 50
percent above last year's levels, he said.
   Charles Wheeler, director of the non-profit National Immigration
Law Center in Los Angeles, said: ``This shows that the
administration's efforts to control illegal immigration through
employer sanctions have not worked to discourage aliens from coming
to the United States.''
   All but 10 of the 947 taken into custody at the San Clemente
border checkpoint were from Mexico. The Mexicans all were returned
after waiving deportation hearings, Swofford said.
   Deportation proceedings were being held for the others, from
Guatemala, India, Egypt, El Salvador and Australia, he said.
   The last major sweep was three years ago when 720 suspected
illegal immigrants were arrested in a 24-hour period, officials
said.
   Four other people were taken into custody for possible alien
smuggling. Swofford said some were released, but he did not have
further details.
   The sweep was accomplished by a team of 67 agents who manned the
border checkpoint and fanned out into fields on both sides of
Interstate 5, said Douglas Becktel, a supervising Border Patrol
agent.
   Northbound freeway traffic was tied up for several miles from 5
p.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday.
   A helicopter searchlight helped spot illegal immigrants
attempting to get around the checkpoint. Most of those arrested
were either walking or riding in cars and trucks trying to cross
the checkpoint, Becktel said.

   Immigration officials Monday night offered to
release anti-Castro militant Orlando Bosch from federal prison and
place him under a restrictive house arrest, his attorney said.
   Bosch, a convicted terrorist who has been imprisoned since 1988
when he illegally entered the United States, could be released as
early as Tuesday if he agrees to the government's terms, said
attorney Raoul Cantero.
   For two years, the Justice Department has sought to deport
Bosch, but 31 countries have said they will not take him.
   Bosch's family maintains the 63-year-old former pediatrician is
suffering from ulcers and that years in prison have taken their
toll.
   Bosch was jailed for 11 years in Venezuela for the 1976 bombing
of a Cuban jetliner that killed all 73 people aboard, mostly Cuban
athletes.
   After being acquitted in three trials, Bosch returned to Miami
in 1988 to be reunited with his family, and was immediately
arrested for violating his parole.
   The Bosch controversy has been a cause celebre for Miami's
staunchly anti-Castro Cuban exile community, which has held rallies
and demonstrations on his behalf attended by leading politicians.
   The two-page list of conditions for Bosch's release that the
government set include requirements that Bosch wear an electronic
monitoring device, remain at home for 21 hours a day, keep a
visitors' log and allow his telephone to be monitored, said Richard
Smith, director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
in Miami.
   Bosch also would be subject to unannounced searches, lie
detector tests and would be banned from meeting with any Cuban
exile groups that advocate violence to achieve their political
goals, according to Cantero.
   The agreement also says the INS can alter the terms of Bosch's
house arrest program at any time, and if instructed, he must
present himself for deportation within 72 hours, Smith's statement
said.
   Attorney Henry Adorno said Bosch would agree to all the
conditions except for the visitors log.
   Keeping the log ``would indicate to the people of this community
that he is an informant. He is not an informant. He believes that
lists are kept by people like Joe McCarthy and Fidel Castro,'' said
Adorno.
   ``This set of conditions is so ridiculous. You get more freedom
in a communist country than you do with this ... it's pure
harassment,'' said Myriam Bosch, one of Bosch's daughters.
   The release offer signified a departure for the Justice
Department, which has maintained for years that Bosch would
continue his terrorist ways if released.
   ``It would be prejudicial to the public interest for the U.S. to
provide a safe haven for Bosch. We must look on terrorism as a
universal evil, even if it is directed toward those with whom we
have no political sympathy,'' wrote acting-Associate Attorney
General Joseph Whitley in a 1989 deportation order.
   Even before the airliner bombing, in which he has denied
involvement, Bosch had an extensive record of involvement in
terrorist acts directed at Fidel Castro's communist government.
   In 1968, he was convicted of firing a bazooka at a freighter at
the Port of Miami. He was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison
and was paroled in 1972.
   In 1974, Bosch fled the country in violation of parole. He
traveled throughout Central and South America, using aliases.

   The woman whose lawsuit led to legalized
abortion in 1973 called for an economic boycott of Louisiana on
Monday if a bill banning abortion on demand becomes law in that
state.
   Norma McCorvey, the Jane Roe of the U.S. Supreme Court case Roe
vs. Wade, said she and her lawyer, Gloria Allred, have sent a
letter to Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer urging him to veto the bill.
   The bill approved Sunday night bans all abortions except those
to end pregnancies that endanger a woman's life and those caused by
rape or incest that are promptly reported. The bill is weaker than
one Roemer vetoed last week, but still would be the nation's
strictest state abortion law.
   Roemer has 20 days to veto the bill before it goes into effect.
If he vetoes it, the only way the Legislature could revive it would
be to call itself into special session for another override vote.
   ``If this bill is not vetoed, not only will women lose their
rights as individuals but women will have illegal abortions that
may possibly end up in death,'' said Ms. McCorvey.
   She and Ms. Allred called on feminist groups to urge the
governor to veto the bill.
   Ms. Allred said she also plans to ask businesses in Louisiana to
help with her fight.
   ``Ms. Roe and I will help to organize a `woman-cott' of
Louisiana and urge all businesses to refuse to hold conventions and
conferences in that state,'' she said. ``We will not allow
Louisiana to continue to make a profit while at the same time
attempting to kill women.''
   The 1973 Roe vs. Wade case, which originated in Texas, made
abortion legal. The U.S. Supreme Court said a woman's
constitutional right to privacy included the right to have an
abortion. The high court judged a Texas state law making abortion a
crime unconstitutional.

   A manager of a Korean-American vegetable market
that has been the target of a 5{-month boycott by black community
activists was charged with assaulting a customer, authorities said
Monday.
   Pong Ok Jang, manager of the Family Red Apple, was charged
Saturday with third-degree assault and released on his own

   Giselaine Felissaint, a Haitian immigrant, said she was beaten
in the store in the Brooklyn borough on Jan. 18. Three employees of
the store grabbed her around the neck, slapped, punched and kicked
her, she said.
   The store workers said they believed she was stealing.
   Black community activists have organized a boycott since the
episode.
   Store owner Bong Jae Jang, the brother of Pong Ok Jang, was
initially arrested, but charges were dismissed June 6 after Ms.
Felissaint told prosecutors the wrong man was charged.
   Pong Ok Jang faces a $1,000 fine and a year in jail if convicted

<TEXT>
   A death row inmate got an indefinite
stay Monday fewer than 15 hours before his scheduled execution, and
another condemned man was granted a temporary reprieve.
   Roy Allen Stewart and William Squires both had been scheduled to
die in Florida's electric chair Tuesday.
   Stewart, under his third death warrant, got a temporary stay
Monday from a state judge in Miami. He is now scheduled for
execution at 7:01 a.m. Wednesday.
   Squires, under his first warrant, turned to the federal courts
Monday for the first time and got a stay several hours later from a
judge in Fort Myers.
   Stewart, 34, was condemned for the February 1979 murder of a
77-year-old woman who invited him into her home for a sandwich but
became angry after seeing him take a gold watch.
   Squires, 48, was convicted of the September 1980 fatal shooting
of a service station attendant in Hillsborough County.
   None of the 22 men executed in Florida since the state resumed
capital punishment in 1979 went to the electric chair under the
first death warrant.
   Defense attorneys for the men reprieved Monday have alleged that
Florida's electric chair is broken and would subject their clients
to cruel and unusual punishment.
   In May, during the execution of Jesse Tafero, smoke and flames
rose from the head piece over Tafero's hea.
   The defense attorneys, who also raised the claim in the case of
condemned ``Black Widow'' killer Judi Buenoano last month, say the
problem was a broken head electrode that has not been fixed. The
electrode, they say, lowered the level of electricity from a fatal
2,400 volts to a mere 90 or 100 volts.
   The state Department of Corrections, however, maintains that the
problems in the Tafero execution were caused by a new synthetic
sponge that has been replaced.
   Several state and federal courts have rejected the defense
contentions. The issue is pending before the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta, which issued Ms. Buenoano an
indefinite stay.

<HEAD>Gannett Sees Profit Dropping in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROSSLYN, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gannett Co. Inc. says it expects
second-quarter earnings to be lower than a year earlier, its first
quarterly drop since the company went public 22 years ago.
   Sheila Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the nation's biggest newspaper
company, said July 6 that Gannett would issue its actual earnings
report for the April-June period in a few weeks.
   Douglas McCorkindale, vice chairman and chief financial officer,
first projected an earnings decline during an interview published
in July 6 editions of The Wall Street Journal.
   McCorkindale said he could not disagree with Wall Street
analysts who forecast that Gannett's net income would be below the
$112.1 million, or 70 cents a share, of the year-earlier quarter.
However, he would not predict specific earnings figures.
   A decline in earnings would indicate how Gannett is being
affected by a slump that has hit the entire newspaper industry. A
number of Wall Street analysts have forecast declines for earnings
of many newspaper publishers because of the soft ad revenue.
   ``We started to see softness in advertising business in 1989,
and have been getting softer in the last eight to 12 months,''
McCorkindale said. ``We have not seen any signs of improved
business conditions.''
   The expected earnings decline would come at a difficult time for
Gannett.
   The Gannett Foundation, the company's largest shareholder,
announced April 26 that it planned to sell its 10 percent stake. A
weak stock price could make the company a possible takeover target.
   The foundation, headed by former Gannett Chairman Allen
Neuharth, is sorting through potential bidders.

<HEAD>Ingersoll Gives Up U.S. Newspapers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ralph Ingersoll II agreed to give up control of
his U.S. newspapers after failing to make an interest payment on
junk bonds.
   The publisher said he would trade his U.S. interests and their
troublesome debt to his investment partners in exchange for control
of a smaller group of European newspapers.
   Ingersoll, whose U.S. properties included the New Haven (Conn.)
Register and the short-lived St. Louis Sun, said the July 2 deal
was driven by a desire to get more involved in European publishing.
   But bankers and investors with knowledge of the publisher said
Ingersoll was facing the same reckoning as Robert Campeau and
Donald Trump, who also used junk bond financing to build business
empires but couldn't handle their massive interest payments.
   ``He has an unworkable balance sheet,'' said James Rubin, an
analyst at M.D. Sass Investors Services, a New York investment firm
that successfully urged bondholders to reject Ingersoll's bid to
work out his debt troubles this spring.
   Rubin said Ingersoll took on too much debt in buying daily and
weekly newspapers and was hurt further by the nationwide slump in
advertising revenue.
   Ingersoll is relinquishing his stake in three companies that
publish dozens of daily and weekly newspapers to the New York
investment firm E.M. Warburg, Pincus &amp; Co. The two had been joint
owners, although Ingersoll had voting control.
   Warburg, Pincus gains full control of Ingersoll Newspapers Inc.,
which publishes nine dailies and 53 weeklies; New Haven Acquisition
Co., publisher of the Register; and Community Newspapers Inc.,
which has newspapers in Ohio and on New York's Long Island.
   Ingersoll President Robert Jelenic, formerly second-in-command,
was made chief executive officer of the new company.
   Ingersoll, meanwhile, will gain control of a group of British
and Irish newspapers that he controlled jointly with Warburg,
Pincus.
   The announcement came as Community Newspapers said it would not
make a July 1 interest payment on its $125 million in 13 percent
junk bonds. Ingersoll had been trying for months to buy back the
bonds at a steep discount to alleviate his debt burden.
   In a telephone interview, Ingersoll said the three U.S.
companies were on track to make $100 million in profits before
taxes and interest this year on revenue of $400 million.
   ``We are having a record year despite the economy,'' he said.
   The companies could have serviced their debt if not for the
collapse of the junk bond market, which hit bonds like Community
Newspapers' especially hard, Ingersoll said.
   The announcement comes a little more than two months after
Ingersoll folded the St. Louis Sun, a new tabloid that he hoped
would revolutionize the slumping newspaper market by using new
technology and marketing strategies.
   The British and Irish newspapers Ingersoll is gaining have
combined circulations exceeding 1 million and annual revenue of
$178 million.
   Europe offers great opportunities because of the planned
dropping of trade barriers in Western Europe and the spread of
free-market economies in the East, Ingersoll said.

<HEAD>Reporter Remains Jailed After Source Identified</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reporter jailed for refusing to identify a
news source remained behind bars despite a sheriff's claim that the
source had been discovered.
   Sheriff Harlon Copeland said July 5 the source was a cousin of a
murder suspect that KMOL-TV reporter Brian Karem interviewed last
year.
   Karem started a six-month term for contempt of court on June 27.
He won't be freed early without disclosing the source himself, said
Prosecutor Beth Taylor.
   ``He still has to produce a piece of paper of his sources. We
need to see that,'' she said.
   State District Judge Pat Priest agreed, but Karem refused to
back down.
   ``I have a promise between myself and that source. That source
has not absolved me of my promise,'' the reporter said.
   Jane Kirtley, executive director of The Reporters Committee for
Freedom of the Press in Washington, said the only reason Karem was
still in jail was to punish him.
   ``Once you've got the name of the source, you don't have to keep
the journalist jailed, unless you're just offended that the
journalist wouldn't buckle under to you,'' she said.
   Karem has refused to say who arranged an interview with Henry
David Hernandez, accused of killing a San Antonio police officer
last year. In the telephone interview, Hernandez said from the jail
that he shot the officer in self-defense.
   Defense attorneys and prosecutors say they have to know who
arranged the interview to determine if the interview is admissible
in his trial.
   Copeland said he learned the name June 29 through his own
investigation and tried to tell the judge, but was told Priest
could not discuss the case with him.

<HEAD>Sports Editors Seek Review of Club Racial Policies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Associated Press Sports Editors called on
major golf organizations to examine the membership policies of
country clubs before awarding championship events.
   The July 2 action followed statements by Hall Thompson, founder
of the Shoal Creek Golf Club near Birmingham, Ala., that the club
``would not be pressured'' into accepting blacks. Shoal Creek is
the site of next month's PGA Championship.
   ``The country club is our home and we pick and choose who we
want,'' Thompson said, adding that blacks were not admitted to the
club because ``that's not done in Birmingham.'' He later apologized
to ``those that took offense at those comments.''
   The APSE, an organization of sports editors of AP member
newspapers, sent a letter protesting Thompson's remarks to Patrick
J. Reilly, president of the PGA; Deane Beman, commissioner of the
PGA Tour; Grant Spaeth, president of the United States Golf
Association, and William Blue, commissioner of the LPGA.
   The letter urged that membership and guest policies of country
clubs be considered before championship sites are chosen.
   The letter was signed by John Rawlings of the San Jose Mercury
News, the APSE president, and Dave Robinson of the Detroit Free
Press, APSE liason to the Golf Writers Association of America.

<HEAD>Technicians Reject AP Contract Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Technical employees of The Associated Press have
rejected a proposed two-year contract with the news agency, their
union said July 3. The union and the AP agreed to meet again July 9.
   James Peecook, president of Local 1314 of the Communications
Workers of America, said members overwhelmingly rejected the
contract. He said the vote count would not be released.
   AP technicians have been working under a contract extension
since early last month, when negotiators agreed to submit a
two-year contract proposal to a ratification vote. The union,
however, described the pact as inadequate and urged members to
reject it.
   Local 1314 represents about 300 AP technicians.
   The contract calls for a ``managed care'' approach to control
the cost of the medical plan. It also proposes weekly pay increases
of $23.50 for top-scale technicians in the first year and $24 in
the second, bringing weekly top-scale technician salaries to $612
in 1991.

<HEAD>Newspaper Photographers, Reporter Injured in Melee at Club</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dispute with promoters prompted the rap group 2
Live Crew to cancel a concert July 7, triggering a melee by fans
that injured two newspaper photographers and a reporter.
   The rappers, whose album ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' has been
ruled obscene by a Florida judge and banned in San Antonio, refused
to play after a promoter refused to pay them in advance.
   Shortly afterward, about 50 people went on a rampage, breaking
chairs and throwing bottles. Police in riot gear dispersed the
crowd within 15 minutes.
   Dallas Times Herald photographers Jesse Hornbuckle and Cedric
Thompson, assigned to cover the concert, were treated for minor
injuries.
   Reporter Mindy Donnelly was hit in the head and lost a tooth cap
but didn't require treatment.
   Hornbuckle said up to 10 fans attacked him as he attempted to
photograph a smaller group attacking Thompson. Cameras and other
equipment belonging to both photographers were destroyed by the
fans.
   Hornbuckle salvaged one roll of film, and his picture of a fan
being restrained by guards appeared in one edition of the Times
Herald on July 8.
   A car belonging to another Herald reporter was vandalized. The
fans also smashed the windshield of a KXAS-TV remote broadcast van.

<HEAD>Condoms Attached to Newspapers in Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS activists attached condoms to 2,000 coin-box
copies of The Arizona Republic to protest an editorial cartoon that
one protester claimed amounted to ``AIDS hate-mongering.''
   The June 26 cartoon by the newspaper's editorial cartoonist
Scott Stantis showed two men walking into a bathhouse and one
saying, ``It puts me in a tizzie to think the government hasn't
done a thing to stop the spread of AIDS.''
   The Phoenix chapter of the national AIDS Coalition To Unleash
Power, or ACT UP, said it attached the condoms in packages
emblazoned with the group's name to July 2 editions of the
newspaper on sale in Phoenix and three suburbs.
   ``That cartoon presents such misinformation, it's a heinous
crime to the Valley,'' said the chapter's vice chairman, Jeff
Ofstedahl. ``It was AIDS hate-mongering. ... It's been the gay
community that's been chiefly responsible for closing down the
bathhouses.''
   Stantis said the cartoon was inspired by the ``abominable''
disruption of last month's Sixth International Conference on AIDS
in San Francisco by AIDS activists who drowned out a speech by
Health Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   The activists have criticized U.S. immigration restrictions on
people with AIDS and say more money needs to be put toward the
fight against AIDS.

<HEAD>State Shows Interest in Daily News Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York state is preparing to enter the
negotiations between the Daily News and its 10 unions, the head of
the state mediation board said July 3.
   The chairman of the panel, Hezekiah Brown, said that because of
union support for state intervention he would begin the process
leading to a formal state inquiry into contract negotiations at the
tabloid.
   Brown would look at the negotiations between the paper and the
unions. If he determined it could be helpful to a settlement he
would recommend the state labor commissioner form a board of
inquiry.
   A board of inquiry, usually formed during a strike, is used to
air differences between disputing parties and help them resolve
their problems. It has subpoena power but no enforcement power.
   The Daily News is involved in contentious negotiations with the
10 unions making up the Allied Printing Trades Council over
contracts that expired in March.
   One of the first steps toward a board of inquiry is to get at
least one of the parties in a dispute to say it wants a board.
   The council adopted a unanimous resolution July 3 supporting a
board because, it said in a statement, ``efforts to effect
voluntary settlement of the disputes at the Daily News have been
unsuccessful.''
   The unions complain, among other things, that the hired
negotiators are not familiar with operations at the News; that the
News is trying to eliminate the unions; and that strikes or
lockouts are feared.
   John T. Sloan, the paper's vice president for human resources,
did not return telephone calls seeking comment. His secretary
referred a reporter to a statement Sloan made earlier that the News
favored face-to-face talks without outside participants.

<HEAD>Arizona Supreme Court on Delivery People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers could be liable in some instances for
the acts of their delivery people, the Arizona Supreme Court said
July 3.
   The decision came on a lawsuit filed by William Santiago, a
motorcyclist injured in a 1986 collision with Frank Frausto, who
was delivering Sunday editions of The Arizona Republic.
   Trial judge Daniel Nastro of Maricopa County Superior Court
ruled that Santiago could not sue the Republic's corporate parent,
Phoenix Newspapers Inc., because Frausto was an independent
contractor and not a PNI employee.
   The Supreme Court, in its 5-0 decision, said Nastro should have
let a jury decide the question because there was conflicting
evidence as to Frausto's relationship to PNI.
   ``A jury could infer ... that Frausto was an employee because
PNI involved itself with the details of delivery, received directly
all customer complaints and changes so as to remove much of
Frausto's independence, retained broad discretion to terminate, and
relied heavily on Frausto's services for the survival of its
business,'' the court said.
   ``The jury also could infer that Frausto was an independent
contractor because he used his own car, was subject to little
supervision, provided some of his own supplies, and could have
someone else deliver for him within limits.''
   Frausto's contract with PNI specifically said that he was an
independent contractor, not an employee.
   But the court said contract language ``does not determine the
relationship'' and that juries must look to such factors as the
extent to which the workers set their own hours and working
conditions, their degree of specialization, who pays for the
material, how long the relationship lasts, whether pay varies with
the work, how important the work is to the employer's bottom line
and how the parties to the contract see their relationship.

<HEAD>Damages for Man Named in Newsletter Reversed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court has overturned
$32,500 in damages awarded to a Santa Cruz man who sued a women's
group for libel after its newsletter named him as a would-be rapist
without proof.
   In a ruling June 27, the 6th District Court of Appeal said the
trial judge failed to tell the jury that it had to find negligence
by Santa Cruz Women Against Rape before awarding damages for libel.
   It also said the jury should have been told that a deliberate or
reckless falsehood was required for punitive damages, which made up
most of the award.
   A lawyer for Steven Carney, whose damages were reversed by the
ruling, said July 2 that he looked forward to a new trial.
   ``We'll get a better verdict,'' said attorney David Sabih.
``Negligence is failure to investigate. ...They admitted they never
investigated this girl's complaint.''
   Sabih said the center had stopped publishing the names of
alleged rapists in its newsletter based solely on the statements of
the center's clients _ the practice that led to the suit.
   The court said a 19-year-old drug store co-worker of Carney's,
identified as Karen W., came to the center in June 1984 and told
staffers that Carney and another man had taken advantage of her the
previous night after she had passed out drunk. Five months later,
the center printed Carney's name, description and workplace in its
newsletter under the heading ``assault@attempted rape.''
   The center admitted it had relied solely on the woman's account
and its observations of her behavior and had not tried to contact
Carney or investigate in any other way, the court said.
   Before the trial, Karen W. sent Carney a letter, part of a
settlement of suits they had filed against each other, saying she
had not been raped or had sex with either man.

   Cities and towns have little control over

municipalities to regulate cable TV.
   Rep. Spencer Black, D-Madison, told a news conference July 2

competition leaves the companies with little incentive to improve.
   Tom Hanson, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Cable Communications
Association, said government regulation wouldn't help.
   He said rate increases had been needed to increase cable
programming and for special features, such as sports events.

   NBC says it wasn't trying to fool anyone with
its special morning coverage July 5 of the dramatic match between
Zina Garrison and Steffi Graf.
   Many viewers in the United States might not have known that the
coverage was taped, not live.
   Garrison's upset of the two-time defending women's champion had
been over more than an hour, but the only indication of that was a
single announcement by host Bob Costas midway through the telecast.
There were no other reminders, no graphic on the screen.
   ``We didn't think it was necessary because Costas made an
announcement about halfway through the match,'' said network
spokesman Ed Markey. ``We weren't trying to mislead viewers at
all.''
   Markey said NBC had been faced with showing the whole match on
tape delay or picking it up in progress.
   The All England Lawn Tennis Club, and not NBC, schedules the
matches, and Garrison-Graf was entering the third set when NBC came
on the air.
   ``If we can go on live, that's our obvious preference,'' Markey
said. ``But our main objective is to present the match to viewers
as a complete story and in as close a sequence of how it unfolded
as possible.
   ``Given the restrictions, we felt that was the best way to
accomplish that.''

<HEAD>TV Station Sues Government for Crash Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A television station has sued four federal
agencies to get documents related to the 1985 crash of a military
transport plane that killed 248 U.S. soldiers.
   KDKA filed the suit June 29 in U.S. District Court in
Washington, D.C. Managing Editor Jim Esser said July 6 that the
station is requesting more than 2,000 pages of documents.
   Esser said the station filed the suit after making 70 requests
for documents with numerous government agencies. The requests under
the federal Freedom of Information Act turned up nothing that the
station considered significant, he said.
   The agencies sued included the Justice Department and the FBI.
Esser would only say the station was seeking ``documents related to
the crash.''
   KDKA began looking into the accident because 14 families in the
Pittsburgh area lost relatives in the crash. ``We've turned up
enough unanswered questions that we feel it has to be pursued,''
Esser said.
   The crash occurred Dec. 12, 1985, in Gander, Newfoundland,
Canada. It also killed eight crew members of the chartered Arrow
Air troop transport.

   A year ago, the idea would have been unthinkable.
Now it is the most compelling question to confront these leaders of
the Western world: Should they dig into their deep pockets to help
the Soviet Union and Mikhail S. Gorbachev?
   The risk of saying no could be the failure of perestroika _ the
ambitious restructuring of the Soviet system _ and Gorbachev's
downfall. But saying yes has its perils, too, since it would mean
pouring billions into an economic morass that has resisted five
years of Gorbachev reforms.
   But ``Where would we be if he were chucked out?'' Brian
Mulroney, the Canadian prime minister, wondered aloud on Sunday as
he and leaders of the six other richest nations gathered for their
annual economic summit. Still, Mulroney himself isn't ready to
provide direct help just now.
   Even more skeptical is President Bush, who received Gorbachev's
plea for help in his role as summit host. The President questions
the wisdom of assisting the Kremlin while it provides $5 billion a
year to Marxist Cuba, spends about one-quarter of its budget on the
military and has put few free-market procedures into play.

   Mikhail Gorbachev and trade feuds aren't the only
hot topics on Houston's summit menu.
   At the Goode Co. Bar-B-Q barn, loyalists were simmering over the
rival stuff the folks tasted at Sunday night's presidential hoedown
for his summit guests. George Bush probably would agree. His
favorite, Otto's, wasn't served up, either.
   In Houston, barbecue is a serious subject and a never-ending
source of argument. ``We're the best,'' boasted Goode Co. manager
Tanguy Libbrecht. ``Otto's is arguably one of the best-known
because George Bush plugs it. I've got nothing bad to say against
Luther's, but everyone know's we're the best.''
   Luther's Bar-B-Q, a popular chain that sports red-and-white
check tablecloths and curtains and boasts a ``Taste as Big as
Texas,'' donated all the food at Bush's summit feast for 5,000
people. The spread included 1,250 gallons of barbecue sauce, 500
pounds of onions and a jalapeno or two.

   Democratic Rep. James McClure Clarke is being

industry continue investing in junk bonds. So did 113 other House
members, none of whom were criticized for that on the GOP hit list.
   Clarke is one of the politicians caught in the crossfire as
Democrats develop the theme they hope to ride to the White House in

   Despite spiraling heath care costs, Americans
are using a smaller chunk of their income for out-of-pocket medical
expenses than they were 30 years ago, a team of government
economists reports.
   The bite is about the same as in 1972-73, said the Health Care
Financing Administration researchers.
   The reason, says Katharine R. Levit, is that private insurance
is providing more benefits _ in large part because states are
requiring more coverage _ and employers have been unsuccessful in
shifting the costs of better coverage to workers.
   That's bound to change, she predicts, as consumers are pressured
to carry a larger share of the burden.

this week in a case that raised questions about social workers'
failure to protect the toddler.
   Prosecutors will seek the death penalty for Thomas Coe, who told
police he was punishing Bradley McGee for soiling his diaper. The
boy's death brought unprecedented charges against four social
workers, one of whom was convicted of child abuse.
   ``If nothing else, all this has made caseworkers be more careful
to realize they're making life-or-death decisions here,'' said Pam
Kirkland, the boy's foster mother before he was returned to Coe and
the mother who abandoned him. ``With every child, they have to stop
and ask _ `Could this be the next Bradley McGee?'''
   Coe, 23, goes on trial Tuesday in Fort Myers. Defense attorneys
have acknowledged the dunking but say Coe did not intend to kill
the boy, so it wasn't murder.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ One of the world's dirtiest
capitals is becoming cleaner because public-spirited citizens got
fed up with the filth and decided to tackle it themselves.
   ``Everybody's sick and tired, and ashamed, of the situation,''
said Cayotte Bissainthe, co-director of Lave Figi Potoprens, Creole
for Let's Wash the Face of Port-au-Prince.
   ``If the government can't cope, we'll roll up our sleeves and
clean up the mess ourselves,'' she said.
   From her makeshift office downtown, Bissainthe and three other
unpaid members of the Lave Figi steering committee coordinate 100
neighborhood committees involved in the project.
   Cleanup squads have been taking a city block at a time,
sweeping, hauling away refuse, hosing down and sometimes repairing
the pavement, even planting trees in old tires filled with earth.
In some cases, they've added a decorative touch by painting wall
murals.
   ``The response has been wonderful and shows how full of life and
hope the Haitian people are, in spite of all our troubles,''
Bissainthe said.
   This destitute city of more than 1 million people has long been
not only unsightly, but woefully unsanitary, with chest-high heaps
of garbage on every corner, and sometimes even in the middle of the
street.
   Only 50 percent of the 500 tons of garbage the capital produces
daily was picked up even in better times _ before the Public Works
Ministry took over garbage collection from the city last year.
   Torrential rains washed the rest downhill, through the slums and
into the polluted bay.
   Ecologists of the Federation of the Friends of Nature raised
alarms about the health hazard but the city government went broke
and, through similar mismanagement and corruption, so did the
Public Works Ministry.
   Since April 12, when the government officially recognized it,
Lave Figi has received $4,350 in private donations, ranging from
individual gifts of $2 to a $2,100 contribution from the Roman
Catholic charity CARITAS.
   President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot's civilian government, which
assumed power March 13, is in financial straits and has not yet
been able to fulfill its promise of funds for the campaign.
   Lave Figi has used the donated money to buy safety masks and
hire workers to load garbage trucks. Businessmen provide some
workers on loan.
   Shovels, rakes and wheelbarrows have been donated. The
government provides the garbage trucks and Lave Figi fills the gas
tanks and tips the drivers.
   ``We have no choice but to do it ourselves; our lives and our
dignity depend on it,'' said Bissainthe, who was Haiti's consul
general in Puerto Rico for a time after dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier fled the country in 1986.
   Response to Lave Figi was immediate from a citizenry that
suffered one variety of flu after another and had to live with
stench, flies, roaches and rats. Sixty neighborhood organizations
joined as soon as it was formed.
   ``It isn't as much as we need, but it encourages us to go on,''
said Max Valbrun, 24, co-leader of the Dehoux Street Youth
Committee. ``In our four years' existence, this is the first time
we have been able to get any outside help.''
   The 50 youths of the Dehoux Street committee clean up their

   Lave Figi is non-partisan, but Bissainthe said community action
is part of the struggle for democracy in Haiti.
   ``The same community effort to clean its collective house
occurred spontaneously after the fall of Duvalier, but this time
the movement is organized citywide,'' she said.
   ``Our aim is to give it a permanent structure, to set up a
non-profit association which will see that our citizens' initiative
lives on and on and on.''

   Today is Saturday, July 21, the 202nd day of 1990. There are 163
days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On July 21, 1925, the so-called Monkey Trial ended in Dayton,
Tenn., with John T. Scopes found guilty of violating state law for
teaching Darwin's Theory of Evolution. (The conviction was later
overturned.)
   On this date:
   In 1816, Paul Julius Reuter, founder of the British news agency
that bears his name, was born in Hesse, Germany.
   In 1831, Belgium became independent as Leopold the First was
proclaimed King of the Belgians.
   In 1861, the first Battle of Bull Run was fought at Manassas,
Va., resulting in a Confederate victory.
   In 1899, author Ernest Hemingway was born in Oak Park, Ill.
   In 1944, American forces landed on Guam during World War II.
   In 1944, the Democratic national convention, meeting in Chicago,
nominated Sen. Harry S. Truman to be vice president.
   In 1949, the U.S. Senate ratified the North Atlantic Treaty by a
vote of 82-13.
   In 1954, France surrendered North Vietnam to the Communists.
   In 1961, Captain Virgil ``Gus'' Grissom became the second
American to rocket into a sub-orbital pattern around the earth,
flying aboard the Liberty Bell 7.
   In 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin ``Buzz''
Aldrin blasted off from the moon after 21{ hours on the surface and
returned to the command module, piloted by Michael Collins.
   In 1983, Maine schoolgirl Samantha Smith ended her two-week tour
of the Soviet Union as she and her parents left without getting to
see the man who had invited them, Yuri V. Andropov.
   In 1988, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis accepted the
Democratic presidential nomination at the party's convention in
Atlanta.
   Ten years ago: Draft registration began in the United States for
   19- and 20-year-old men as anti-war demonstrators staged protests.
   Five years ago: A state of emergency went into effect in South
Africa, giving police broad new powers in 36 towns and cities to
combat anti-apartheid rioting.
   One year ago: The State Department confirmed an ABC News report
that Felix S. Bloch, a veteran U.S. diplomat, was being
investigated as a possible Soviet spy. (To date, Bloch has yet to
be charged with a crime.)
   Today's Birthdays: Violinist Isaac Stern is 70. Actor-comedian
   Don Knotts is 66. Movie director Norman Jewison is 64. Actor Edward
Herrmann is 47. Yusuf Islam, formerly singer Cat Stevens, is 43.
Comedian-actor Robin Williams is 38.
   Thought for Today: ``There is no bigotry like that of `free
   thought' run to seed.'' -- Horace Greeley, American journalist
(1811-1872).

<TEXT>
   America, land of immigrants, has long been of
two minds about immigration.
   On the one hand, people remember their own forebears. They react
to the words on the base of the Statue of Liberty.
   On the other hand, the new immigrant is often resented. When the
Irish were pouring into America by the tens of thousands to avoid
famine, public sentiment was against Irish immigration.
   When Italians arrived by the boatload to provide the labor
supply that transformed the country from an agricultural society
into an industrialized society, sentiment was anti-Italian.
   When the Chinese settled in San Francisco and became famous for
the laundries they operated, their non-Chinese competitors
persuaded the state legislature to require that laundries be built
of brick. Somehow, the only launderers prosecuted for working out
of wooden buildings were Chinese.
   There's always been at work a last-one-off-the-boat,
pull-up-the-ladder syndrome.
   Organized labor, normally on the liberal side of issues,
frequently opposes liberalized immigration. It suspects immigrants
will take jobs and take lower wages.
   Old Guard conservatives also often want to restrict immigration.
They fear that the Western European heritage that is the foundation
of the Constitution and the culture will be worn away under waves
of today's newcomers, many dark-skinned and from the Third World,
who know nothing of the Bible, the Magna Carta, checks and balances.
   Yet humanitarian instincts exert their own tug. The land of
opportunity over the decades has sheltered those yearning to be
free.
   Exerting the tug these days are Russian Jews and Eastern
Europeans who waited for years for the opportunity to leave and
risked much by applying to go; Vietnamese who jeopardized their
lives to flee home in dangerous boats; Afghans who fought in a war
supported by the United States.
   Let them in, argues a conservative economist, Stephen Moore, who
said he bases his appeal not on any squishy sentimentality but on
self-serving pragmatism.
   ``I see it not that we're doing good for them but that they do
good for us,'' he said.
   Moore, formerly with the Heritage Foundation, is executive
director of the American Immigration Institute, newly founded to
campaign for increased immigration. Its co-chairmen are a
conservative, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., who was born in Berlin,
and a liberal, Mayor Raymond Flynn of Boston.
   ``If America's going to continue to be a first-class economic
power, we've got to be able to compete,'' Moore said in an
interview. ``If an immigrant works 18 hours a day, that's not
something to be held against him, that's what capitalism is all
about: work hard and you'll get ahead.''
   He said the United States now admits about three immigrants per
1,000 residents. At the turn if the century it was 15 per 1,000.
His group wants to return to 15.
   At the same time, as a conservative, Moore opposes the $5,000
per person given refugees (but not immigrants) resettling in the
United States as a safety net. He said it implants a welfare
mentality, starts the newcomers off looking for handouts.
   ``Refugees locating in California have four times as high a
dependency rate and only half the labor force participation rate as
do those in Texas, where benefits are less than half as generous,''
he said in an essay in Policy Review, published by the Heritage
Foundation. He would substitute low-interest loans.
   U.S. law distinguishes between immigrants and refugees and
between economic refugees and political refugees, those who have
``a well-founded fear of persecution'' if they were returned to
their former country of residence.
   Currently, the United States admits about 600,000 people a year,
of whom about 100,000 are political refugees. It is sometimes
estimated that illegal immigration brings the annual total to 1
million.
   Moore argues that the distinction between political and economic
refugees no longer makes sense. The policy, he said, translates to:
``We will not let you die at the hands of the executioner, but are
ambivalent to your death from economic deprivation.''
   He cites what happened 10 years ago. In what became known as the
Mariel boat lift, thousands of Cubans, let loose by Fidel Castro as
a safety valve for his island's faltering economy, traveling in
tiny boats, arrived in Florida. Ultimately, they numbered about
120,000.
   Americans looked askance. In a poll, 91 percent said all
immigration to the United States should be halted until the
national unemployment rate, then 7 percent, fell to 5 percent.
   Much was made of the psychotics and the criminals Castro sent
along with economic immigrants.
   ``But if you look at the vast majority who came, they have
assimilated extraordinarily well in the Miami economy, which
throughout the 1980s flourished,'' said Moore. Miami Mayor Xavier
Suarez called the boat lift the greatest rescue mission since
Normandy.
   Moore said a study done at Princeton University found that eight
years after the Mariel outpouring other minority groups had not
suffered from the infusion of low-skilled workers.
   ``If 100,000 Cubans could assimilate in a very short time in one
labor market, the idea of bringing in more than 600,000 into the
national economy shouldn't frighten us,'' he said.
   ``Immigrants have a very high rate of entrepreneurship,'' he
said. ``We see this in the refugee groups _ the Koreans, the
Vietnamese, the Afghans. It is very common to see Afghans owning
convenience stores, parking lots, taxicab franchises. They're not
only starting businesses, they're often hiring American workers.''

   Too old for head-banging music? Too much
smoke get in your eyes at rock concerts? Tired of shelling out the
big bucks for concert tickets only to have a view that reduces the
performer to the size of a peanut?
   Take heart. In the privacy of your own home there is a way to
see some of the hottest musicians in the business. Up close. With
no special effects. And sans ear-splitting amplification.
   In an industry where folk music and acoustic guitars are making
a comeback, television, too, has picked up a softer beat when it
comes to rock 'n' roll.
   One of the more unlikely places to see it is on MTV. The music
network's ``Unplugged,'' which airs Sundays at 11 p.m., offers a
mix of big-name stars and up-and-coming musicians in a decidedly
different format from its usual flash and fire. The music is
performed live specifically for the program in intimate studio
settings. No videos or concert clips.
   ``Unplugged,'' which debuted in January, has only one rule: no
matter who you are, no matter what kind of music you play,
everything on this show is acoustic. No amps.
   Showtime's ``Coast to Coast'' is another place to see favorite
rockers up close, without hype and in original live performances.
Unlike ``Unplugged,'' Showtime's program, which has no scheduled
time slot, does not take place in a television studio and musicians
can use all the amplification they want.
   Instead, writer-director-producer Ken Ehrlich assembles a
gathering of like-minded musicians to play whatever their hearts
desire at various clubs across the country.
   Hosted by Herbie Hancock, the latest ``Coast to Coast''
installment will air Saturday and features a custom-made
celebration of jazz, blues and country music by performers such as
Bonnie Raitt, John Lee Hooker, Lee Ritenour, John Hiatt and John
Prine.
   A recent ``Unplugged'' show featuring ex-Eagle Don Henley was so
successful it actually helped record sales, said Geffen Records
spokeswoman Bryn Bridenthal. ``We definitely see an impact from the
show,'' she said.
   These shows not only offer a new format for old-time rock 'n'
rollers, they also provide an inexpensive way to boost the image of
MTV and Showtime.
   On MTV's ``Unplugged,'' which also has featured sets by Sinead
O'Connor and Elton John, the performers work for free. On ``Coast
to Coast,'' they are paid scale _ only about $250.
   By comparison, the televising of major rock concerts such as
Madonna's Blonde Ambition on HBO or the Rolling Stones' Steel
Wheels on Fox can cost big bucks. MTV doesn't feel it's is worth it.
   ``The cost of (such) live shows can be phenomenal,'' said MTV's
senior vice president of programming, Doug Herzog. ``We had looked
at live shows, but everyone does them.''
   The idea for ``Unplugged,'' Herzog said, came after heavy
metaler Jon Bon Jovi did an acoustic set on the last MTV awards.
   Lee Masters, the popular MTV executive who quit last fall,
explained the premise of ``Unplugged'' more bluntly.
   ``My guess was that it was not going to be a big ratings
getter,'' said Masters, who was involved with the show's inception
before he left.
   ``It was designed to get some great press for the channel. It
was meant as an image piece. You can't get Don Henley to do a
concert on MTV because he's going to charge you a lot of money,''
he added. ``The twist was let's get some people and let them play
acoustically.''
   Said Herzog, ``At first we were a little nervous. I think there
was a little bit of concern that it was going to turn into the
campfire show.''
   But the response from shows such as Henley's, as well as ones
featuring acclaimed singers such as Michelle Shocked and the Indigo
Girls, has lead to an avalanche of requests from performers, Herzog
said.
   ``We've had some really, really big names call and say they want
to do it,'' he said. ``It's really a place for musicians and their
songs. We're trying not to hand it out to very band that comes
along.''
   At Showtime, Ehrlich has been able to coax some of the most shy
singers in the business to do his show. A segment featuring Van
Morrison, a well-known hater of live performing, will air in
September.
   Part of the reason is that Ehrlich has known such folks for a
long time. He has produced big shows such as the Grammy awards, as
well as more humble ventures such as ``Coast to Coast,'' which
debuted in 1987.
   Ehrlich also is the man who did the critically acclaimed
``Soundstage'' on PBS _ the ``granddaddy,'' as he calls it, of
up-close music shows.
   ``What's happened to audiences today is they've been detached
from that up-close, personal, one-on-one relationship with the
artist,'' Ehrlich said. ``Someone who wants to enjoy the music has
a tough time of it from two football fields away.''

<HEAD>Alaska Series Starts CBS Summer Rush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In theory, there may be something funny about a
young New York doctor winding up in a small Alaskan town so far
back in the woods that the mayor is a bear.
   The bad news is that ``Northern Exposure'' has no bear.
   This new CBS summer series, which premieres Thursday, has only
the young New York doctor, the small Alaskan town and an
opening-show script that starts amusingly, then comes down with
attack of the feebles.
   This does not bode well for a one-hour series that hopes to go
beyond the eight weeks CBS is giving it.
   Be that as it may, Rob Morrow stars here as a cocky New York
yuppie _ pardon the redundancy _ fresh out of Columbia Medical
School. His first job is in Alaska because that state, in need of
doctors, financed his education.
   In return, he must work there for four years. Leaving behind his
law-school fiancee, he nervously arrives in Anchorage, bearing golf
clubs and telling a state official he needs a few days to get a
condo, cable TV and such.
   Er, we now have too many doctors, the official says. But the
state will set him up in the backwoods hamlet of Cicely. The young
sawbones, falsely told he can leave the town if he doesn't like it,
decides to give it a shot.
   Thus is the stage set for a clash of cultures, the big-city kid
used to bright lights and brie versus the sturdy, stoic inmates of
a world so removed from New York that one inhabitant even asks,
``What's a bagel?''
   Well, sure as heck, the new sawbones wants out. With seven shows
to go, though, you can safely lay 100-to-1 odds he won't make it.
   Some observers might contend that ``Northern Exposure'' is a
faint echo of ABC's ``Twin Peaks,'' which also is set in a small
backwoods town. Not so. For one thing, ``Twin Peaks'' occurs in
Washington State.
   For another, ``Peaks'' has stoplights. ``Exposure'' doesn't. And
there is no murdered homecoming queen in CBS' show (although
suppose its homecoming queen is a bear? Naaaah).
   However, like ``Peaks,'' ``Exposure'' does have characters who
are a little ... eccentric. One even is a kid who wears a black
leather jacket and whose black hair is parted in the middle.
   Another is a woman who brings a sick beaver in for treatment,
saying, ``I think his teeth hurt.'' There's also a man who, shot in
the leg by his wife, explains, ``She said, `Loud doesn't work with
me anymore.' ''
   There's a beautiful charter pilot, a native of wealthy Grosse
Point, Mich., whose true love froze to death on a glacier. And a
tavern owner whose best friend vows to shoot him dead if the latter
ever speaks to him.
   This is because, the bar owner (John Cullum) explains, his
friend imported a beautiful young woman to marry, but one day she
showed up alone at his bar, ``and said if I wanted her, she was
mine.'' A pause. ``I did.''
   The friend (Barry Corbin), a middle-aged former astronaut, owns
15,000 acres, the town newspaper and its radio station. He's
Cicley's biggest booster and, it turns out, ready to do harm to its
new doctor if he tries to leave.
   ``We've got an outstanding little town here, Joel, ready to step
up in the world,'' he says when they first meet. ``We've got
natural resources, we've got land, we've got wildlife just waiting
to be fondled.''
   Despite such strangeness, these characters are basically decent
folk and have none of the deapan madness of the ``Twin Peaks''
citizenry.
   Morrow, as the young doctor, is very good, even in a script that
after a few nice touches of whimsy just sort of wanders off to a
finale featuring a town festival where our hero munches morosely on
a mooseburger.
   In a way, `Northern Exposure'' may remind some of ``Local
Hero,'' a 1983 film about a Texas oil yuppie who finds the meaning
of life while on business in a remote seacoast town in Scotland.
   But that clash-of-cultures exercise was both funny and moving.
   CBS' Alaskan expedition, created by ``St. Elsewhere'' creators
Joshua Brand and John Falsey, is more like what happens when you
eat a mooseburger. It's mildly interesting at the start, and then
it just sits there.

   ``Not now,'' Hurricane Davis was saying,
sniffing the mountain air. ``Not today. But it will come. Bet on
it.''
   Brush country residents of Southern California and Arizona have
already experienced a hellish version of what Davis expects in the
Northwest, where giant ponderosa pines reach for the sky. He
forsees yet another summer of lightning-born wildfires racing
across America's great Western mountain ranges, the ruggedest
terrain in the land, tinder-dry after five years of drought.
   ``No,'' says Davis, ``don't bet on it, don't tempt the devil.
But don't bet against it. The conditions this season are the worst
I've ever seen.''
   Hurricane Davis is a smokejumper. He reads wildfire conditions
not just off a weather chart but up close on the forest floor.

   The seven world leaders attending the economic
summit have dinner reservations Monday night at Bayou Bend, a
stately mansion that once was the home of the late Ima Hogg, the
oil-rich daughter of the first native-born governor of Texas.
   It will be the first time that a U.S. president, much less the
heads of government of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada or
Japan, have dined at Bayou Bend since it became a museum nearly a
quarter-century ago.
   Sitting amid Miss Hogg's collection of antiques and art objects,
the summit leaders will dine on tortilla soup, cornbread sticks,
grilled gulf red snapper, sweet corn puree and onions, lettuce and
almond salad and American cheeses. For dessert, there will be
blackberry peach swirl ice cream with sliced peaches
   Miss Hogg was a widely known Texas philanthropist from a family
that made a fortune in oil and real estate. Her father, James Hogg,
was the first native-born Texan to become the state's governor. and

   Bayou Bend was built in 1927 along a bend in Buffalo Bayou. The
14-acre estate opened as a museum in 1966. It is situated in the
River Oaks section on Lazy Lane, the most exclusive street in
Houston. The home's value is unknown, but real estate broker Diane
Lokey said the Dogwood Gardens estate next door listed for $11.5
million.
   Bayou Bend Director David B. Warren said the museum was chosen
for the summit dinner partly because of its intimate, historical
atmosphere.
   ``Surrounded by this wonderful collection of American art,
objects and furniture, the president will be able to convey a grand
sense of this country's heritage to our visitors,'' Warren said.

<HEAD>McCALL, Idaho: close edge.''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Koncinski is one of only four year-round staff members at the
McCall base. He is the loft foreman, the supervisor of parachutes,
which undergo some rugged use. The others are a director of
training, a loadmaster, who sees to equipment and cargo, and
Hurricane Davis, the base manager.
   McCall, with 70 jumpers, is the largest of nine bases in Idaho,
Montana, northern California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. But
during the fire season the jumpers move from base to base depending
on where the action is. At one point last year 167 jumpers were
camped at McCall and on four different occasions all were fighting
fires, none in reserve.
   Except for the smattering of administrators, who also jump, all
smokejumpers hire on only for the fire season. Most return year
after year. They are a varied bunch at McCall _ three doctors, a
lawyer, a professor of entomology, a veterinarian, a high school
principal, several teachers. All must pass a rigorous physical test
each summer to re-qualify. Their average age is 32.
   If they have one thing in common it is a love of the outdoors,
of nature. ``Keep a light hand on the land'' is their dictum.
   ``It's quite a feeling,'' said Roger Staats, a 25-year-old
jumper from Colorado, ``to stand on a ridge over a canyon and think
you might be the only person to have set foot on that spot. I don't
want to leave any evidence that I was there.
   ``Once in the wilderness we found a little snowmelt stream
nearby and we diverted it to help catch the fire. When the fire was
out we put the stream back where it was.''
   Most, like Koncinski, who was a forestry student at the
University of Connecticut, learned about the smokejumpers when they
took summer jobs as Forest Service firefighters to earn college
tuition.
   About 500 hopefuls apply each year for only a handful of
openings. All must have experience fighting wildfire but they'll
tell you that veteran smokejumpers and their own experience has
taught them more than they ever learned on a fire line.
   They learn that when lightning hits a tree, the tree explodes in
a spray of burning faggots, or else it spirals down the trunk,
peeling bark like a corkscrew, down to the roots, setting the
forest undergrowth ablaze.
   They learn that a few spruce trees are more dangerous than a
stand of lofty pines, more apt to spread fire to the treetops
because their downswept boughs reach the burning undergrowth. They
know that aspens are slow to catch fire, and that the sage that
perfumes a mountain meadow contains oils that flash off like
gunpowder.
   ``We get a look at the fire from the air, so that's an
advantage,'' said Jerry Ogawa. ``You have an idea of what you're
getting into, how you're going to attack it.''
   Ogawa, 44, is a fourth-grade teacher in Oregon in the winter and
a smokejumper the past 24 years at McCall. He has made about 160
jumps on fires and another 160 for practice. He's seen it all, and
is one of McCall's qualified spotters, the person in charge aboard
the drop airplane.
   Here's how he explains the procedure:
   Lightning hits tree. Mountaintop lookout spots fire. Bell rings
in the McCall ready room. Within 10 minutes 12 jumpers are airborne
aboard a DC-3, which is as old as Jerry Ogawa and maybe even as
durable.
   ``We circle the fire, size it up, check the terrain, select a
landing target and look for a route for the jumpers to pack out to
where somebody can pick them up. I once had to walk 22 miles.
   ``Then we drop streamers to tell us which way the 'chutes will
drift to be on target _ you can only steer them so much. In this
terrain, if the fire is on a ridge and you miss the target you
could wind up halfway down a near-vertical slope and get to the
fire too late.
   ``The streamers also tell us our altitude. We jump at 1,500
feet. The plane has an altimeter, of course, but this country is
all ridges and canyons and we need to be sure. We need for those
streamers to hit the ground in one minute and a half or we adjust
up or down.
   ``The spotter decides how many jumpers it will take to do the
job _ two, four, six. We go in pairs. Everybody likes two-man fires
the best. We send as few as possible so as many as possible will be
available for other fires.
   ``They jump, land, and radio back that they are safe. Then we
make another pass at about 500 feet and drop their fire packs. One
pack for each two men. These contain their tools _ just a
break-down shovel and a pulaski, a combination axe and grubbing hoe
_ and their sleeping bags, first aid kit, water, food for six meals.
   ``Then they're on their own.''
   The jumpers carry a 150-foot let-down rope in one leg pocket in
case they land in a tree, which is not uncommon. In fact, it is
sometimes preferred.
   Tall grass in a mountain clearing may look inviting but
underneath lurk stumps and snags and rocks that can break a leg.
Many a smokejumper has trusted a padded suit and crash helmet and
steered instead for the nearest tree. Later he must climb the tree
to fetch the parachute. No self-respecting smokejumper would come
home without his 'chute
   They wear crash helmets with steel mesh face masks and jump
suits heavily padded from ankle to neck. These they shed on the
ground and fight the fire in jeans and a hardhat. But, get this,
they draw no hazard pay for jumping into those trees and stumps and
rocks. Hazard pay, for these government workers, begins only when
they start fighting the fire, same as if they arrived by truck.
   The risks of smokejumping are obvious, but the jumpers do not
dwell on them.
   Six-year jumper Jim Duzak, a paramedic, only reluctantly tells
about the time he carried out Barry Koncinski after Barry suffered
two broken ankles, or about the night that huge rocks, loosened by
burned-out tree roots, tumbled down the mountain and broke both
arms and a leg of a fellow jumper.
   ``It took all night to pack him out five miles,'' Duzak recalls.
   And no one mentions the fire in Mann Gulch, Mont., where 13
smokejumpers perished and three escaped, but that was back in 1949
when the service was in its infancy.
   Shared risk, though, along with unlimited confidence in one
another, account in large measure for the obvious camaraderie that
has lured these adventurous and resourceful men _ and, since 1982,
women _ back to America's Great Basin each year for half a century.
   ``It's a big fraternity, a family,'' said Hurricane Davis. ``We
think we're among the best. Wait,'' he said. ``Strike `think' and
`among.' We're the best.''

   Fifty years ago two adventurous men in the employ of the U.S.
Forest Service jumped out of an airplane over Martin Creek in
Idaho's Nezperce National Forest and put out a fire.
   Rufus Robinson and Earl Cooley on July 12, 1940, became
America's first smokejumpers.
   What began with two determined men and a revolutionary way to
fight wildfires _ catch 'em while you still can _ today has grown
to an elite corps of about 400 men and women who have logged nearly
200,000 jumps over the last half century.
   Six years before that first jump the idea of parachutists
attacking fires was proposed to the Montana regional forester, Evan
Kelley. In a letter to his superior in Washington Kelley asked that
if the service wanted to get into such foolishness to please do it
in somebody else's region.
   ``The best info I can get from experienced fliers,'' Kelley
wrote, ``is that all parachute jumpers are more or less crazy, just
a little bit unbalanced or they wouldn't be engaged in such a
hazardous undertaking.''
   Others didn't think it was harebrained at all. That same year,
1940, Maj. William Cary Lee visited Montana, watched Cooley and
Robinson train, and adapted their techniques to organize the first
paratroop training center at Fort Benning, Ga. Lee, who later
attained the rank of major general, commanded the 101st Airborne
Division in World War II.
   Cooley jumped 46 times from 1940 to 1951. Today he is a
semi-retired real-estate agent in Missoula, Mont., which is still a
major smokejumper base. Robinson died in Idaho in 1987.
   In a recent telephone interview, Cooley remembered that for him
smokejumping almost ended the day it began.
   Determined to jump that day, despite the conditions, he and
Robinson bailed out in very strong winds.
   Cooley's parachute did not open properly until he was just 600
feet from the ground, and then the strong winds carried him right
through the branches of a huge spruce tree.
   ``I hit this tree about 100 feet up at such speed that I went
through the branches and broke them off, but my chute clung to the
side of the tree,'' he later wrote in his book, ``Trimotor and
Trail.''
   ``I was still swinging, my heart pounding _ I was alive. I felt
for the 100-foot rope in my right pants pocket. I tied my rope to
the chute risers but decided that the chute wasn't hung up well
enough to trust it. I climbed down the limbs to the ground.''
   Today's smokejumpers still carry a rope in their right pants
pocket. and use it often.

   BOISE, Idaho (AP) _ The Boise Interagency Fire Center, which
coordinates firefighting efforts throughout the nation, resembles a
space age war room.
   On one wall is a huge map of the United States, a battle map as
it were, where the center's round-the-clock staff keeps track of
every firefight raging in America and where every firefighting crew
and piece of equipment, down to the last airplane, helicopter, and
pumper truck, is deployed.
   Arrayed before the map are tiers of radar screens that blip and
computer terminals that blink and printers that spit out
minute-by-minute weather reports and other data.
   The director of the center is Jack Wilson, a one-time
firefighter himself, who doesn't try to conceal his pride.
   ``We monitor every single lightning stroke,'' he said, pointing
to a screen dotted with a thousand points of light. ``The ones that
are flashing are the most recent bolts.
   ``Look close. The shapes are different. This one is a positive
bolt, one that comes down from the sky to the ground. That one is
negative, which travels from the ground up.''
   Does that make any difference in starting fires?
   ``No. Just interesting.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The number of illegal aliens sneaking into the
United States through Canada has more than doubled in the past five
years, immigration officials say, mostly refugees from Third World
countries. Often they place their lives in the hands of
unscrupulous smugglers who devise dangerous ways to cross the
border.

   In the dark of night, smugglers lead
illegal immigrants over the spidery underside of a railroad bridge
hundreds of feet above the raging Niagara River that separates the
United States and Canada.
   Others paddle their clients across the river in flimsy rubber
rafts and then drive them hundreds of miles so they can vanish
anonymously into the teeming city.
   Upscale aliens who can pay $20,000 or more ride in chartered
planes and boats. But the less well-heeled are packed like luggage
into the trunks of cars or secret compartments, not much larger
than queen-sized beds, in the backs of tractor-trailers.
   In the desert Southwest, these smugglers are called ``coyotes,''
ruthless operators notorious for the callousness with which they
treat their customers.
   Along the U.S.-Canadian border, they are just as ruthless and
they are becoming one of the biggest problems of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   ``We obviously don't have the hordes of people that you have in
Mexico,'' says John J. Ingham, INS district director in Buffalo.
``Canadians enjoy a high standard of living that's comparable with
the United States, so we don't have Canadians coming across the
border in the same way Mexicans seek entry.''
   What Ingham and his colleagues do have is a stream of refugees
from around the globe who enter Canada on tourist visas _ real or
faked _ and then pay smugglers thousands of dollars to be ferried
across the world's longest unfortified border.
   That stream appears to be swelling at a rapid rate. By one
measure _ seizures of vehicles used in smuggling attempts _
alien-smuggling into New York state alone has risen 150 percent
since 1985. In 1985, 220 vehicles were seized, in 1989 the number
was 560 and the projected figure for 1990 is more than 700.
   While aliens along the Mexican border typically wade the Rio
Grande or cross the desert far from border stations, INS officials
suspect that most illegal aliens coming in from Canada use
established ports of entry.
   Although much of the U.S.-Canadian border is unfenced, it is
guarded by hidden cameras and suspicious natives who are quick to
report strangers to the authorities, Ingham says. At official
border crossings, however, it is all too easy for aliens to blend
in with the crowds.
   ``It's easier to cross the bridges in some ways because of the
volumes of traffic,'' Ingham says. ``With the backups we're having
because of the large number of shoppers coming in, everyone knows
we can't open every trunk.''
   Jerry Maffre, a spokesman for Employment and Immigration Canada,
says his agency, the Canadian equivalent of the INS, does ``have a
concern about people who come here for the sole purpose of trying
to arrange a southbound smuggle.''
   However, Canadian immigration officials can take no action
against them if they have entered Canada legally, Maffre said in a
telephone interview from Ottawa.
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has jurisdiction over attempts
to smuggle aliens into the United States, Maffre said. RCMP
officials did not return several telephone calls seeking comment.
   A husband and wife charged with heading separate smuggling rings
are typical of the operators who deal in human lives, INS officials
say.
   The wife, Cheng Chui-Ping, pleaded guilty on July 27 to
conspiring to transport aliens illegally, admitting that she paid
an undercover Canadian police agent $340 to transport three aliens,
including a pregnant woman, from the Toronto airport to the United
States in March 1989.
   In a written statement submitted to U.S. District Judge Richard
J. Arcara, Ms. Cheng said the pregnant woman was her cousin, Tsui
Kim Wong, and a woman who made the trip to Toronto with her was her
best friend's daughter.
   However, government agents have said the pregnant woman was
actually Wang Sai Zhen, who fled China with her husband and nephew
so she would not be forced to undergo an abortion under China's
harsh family-planning laws.

   The charge carries a maximum of five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine. But under federal sentencing guidelines, Ms. Cheng
would probably face no more than 14 months in prison when she is
sentenced Aug. 8.
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, in a report
last July, named Ms. Cheng, 41, a resident alien who lives in New
York City, as a leader of a ring that charged would-be immigrants
$23,000 apiece to be smuggled into the United States.
   However, the indictment only charged her with the 1989 incident,
which was uncovered during a covert investigation by the INS and
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of traffic in illegal aliens
between Toronto and New York City.
   Her clients, according to court papers, included Li Jin Mu and
his wife, Wang Sai Zhen, the refugees whose plight became a test
case for the new U.S. policy allowing fear of forced abortions to
be grounds for political asylum.
   The papers state that Ms. Cheng personally met Li, his wife and
nephew at the Toronto airport last March and paid a driver $340 to
take them to the U.S. border at Queenston, Ontario. There, a second
driver took over, driving them across the border and across New
York state to Albany.
   In Albany, another member of the ring paid the driver $3,000 and
bought the Li family bus tickets to New York City. But the drivers
were undercover agents from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and
the INS and all involved were arrested.
   Months later, after Li and his nephew had been deported and had
been caught in another smuggling attempt _ this time jammed in with
Uruguayan refugees in the back of a tractor-trailer _ the
government granted Li and his wife political asylum.
   For other aliens, the consequences have been tragic.
   Ms. Cheng's husband, Yick Tak Cheung, is charged with smuggling
dozens of aliens in small rubber rafts across the rapids below
Niagara Falls. Some of the rafts were equipped with cellular phones
that the aliens, or their couriers, could use to arrange for
drivers to meet them on the U.S. shore.
   But they apparently were not equipped with life jackets and four
aliens drowned when a raft deflated and sank in the ice-choked
river in late December 1988.
   ``That was particularly cruel and callous on the part of the
smugglers,'' Ingham says. ``We perceive many of these aliens as
victims.''
   Court papers filed in Yick's case said his ring recruited two
Lewiston taxi drivers to drive the aliens to New York City, without
at first telling them who their fares were. When the cab drivers
figured out what was going on, the threats began.
   In a sworn statement, cab driver James Dullan said an alleged
associate of Yick's told him, ``We take care of our own, one way or
the other.''
   ``I took it as a verbal threat,'' Dullan said. ``Work with him
or else.''
   Yick has pleaded innocent. His lawyer declined to comment.
   Aliens who cannot scrape together large sums of cash can still
use the smugglers' services. To pay their debts to the smugglers,
some pledge themselves to years of menial work in restaurants.
Others allow themselves to be recruited into Chinese organized
crime groups.
   ``It's a form of indentured servitude,'' says Dennis Peruzzini,
an INS investigator in Buffalo.
   While Chinese people comprise the single biggest nationality
involved, the border patrol has caught a veritable United Nations
of aliens in the past few years.
   Large numbers of Jamaicans and Guyanese attempted to sneak into
the United States until Canada toughened its visa requirements for
residents of those Caribbean countries. Agents on the New
York-Quebec border recently found a large group of immigrants from
India, apparently dumped there by a truck driver who panicked after
hearing about a state police truck check on the radio, Ingham said.
   Thirteen were found in a 4-foot-deep, 8-foot-wide hiding space
in a truck trailer at Lewiston in May.
   A smuggling operator arrested a few years ago brought Brazilians
into the country by leading them across the Niagara rapids on the
underside of a railroad bridge, Ingham says.
   ``He'd take the group from Toronto to Niagara Falls, Ontario, by
bus and then under cover of night, he'd take them down over the
side of the bridge and climb onto the arches,'' Ingham says. ``If
you have any degree of fear of heights, that is a scary place.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ What to make of that peril-prone punctuation,
the hyphen? It both divides and unites. In the case of the
Czecho-Slovak Republic it did both at the same time. Now the French
have chased it, like an unwanted ant, from pique-nique. Ignore the
hyphen? Mais non! Take it seriously? Madness. A lingering look at
the curious hyphen with a dash (which is different) of wit.

   It is smaller than an eyelash and less protective, a single,
arbitrary mark in mankind's search for order. It promises clarity
but risks anarchy and, like all efforts to standardize and thus
regulate human behavior, it groans under many burdens and cries
with painful exceptions. It is used to make war and peace and
soothe the pride of nations, brides and banks.
   Some of us can't get the hyphen out of our minds.
   ``Come to terms with this hyphen!'' President Vaclev Havel
implored the Parliament of the new Czechoslovakia this spring.
   But how does one make peace with a tiny, elusive chameleon who
appears in half-life but not at halftime, in Italian-American but
not in Latin American, in flag-waving but not childbearing, a
devious, unpredictable, contrary creature who shows up even in
absentia, as in hyphen-less?
   For 300 rococo years it was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire
and for three shaky weeks this year it lived again in the name of a
descendant.
   With Karl Marx fallen on hard times, the Parliament of
Czechoslovakia talked about dropping ``socialist'' from the name of
the republic. That emboldened the Slovaks to try to improve their
billing. They argued for Czecho-Slovak Republic, thinking the
hyphen would let the world know the country is made up of two
separate states, 5 million Slovaks in one, 10 million Czechs in the
other.
   The majority fought back fiercely. Finally, the brave
legislators came to a neo-Solomonic decision. It would be the
Czechoslovak Federative Republic in the Czech area and the
Czecho-Slovak Federative Republic in Slovakia. Madder than ever,
unrequited Slovaks took to the streets by the thousands demanding a
better name or a completely independent state.
   Weak from a hernia operation, President Havel sought to defuse
the crisis from his hospital bed. He sent a speech begging his
fellow Czechs in Parliament to consider that the hyphen symbolized
the hunger of Slovaks for a national identity they were denied for
centuries under Hungarian kings and even in 1918 at the birth of
the modern nation after World War I.
   He said the founding fathers, Thomas Masaryk and Eduard Benes,
had a hyphenated, two-nation republic in mind but thought that
would be too complicated to explain to the victorious Allied powers
then creating nations at Versailles.
   ``So they left out the dash and that is what gave rise to the
whole painful story of Czechoslovakia.''
   Havel was so eloquent he got more than a hyphen out of
Parliament. He got two spaces and an and. And so it came to pass,
in a part of the world shaped by the tribal migrations before
history and, since then, by wars, revolutions, plots, coups and
summit deals without number, the nation now is officially the Czech
and Slovak Federative Republic.
   Perhaps it was his hernia or the distractions of governance but
the hero of the nation's liberation might be forgiven for mistaking
a dash for a hyphen. A dash is a tad longer and, in function,
probably more useful in Havel's work as a playwright and
politician. Its first assigned mission is to indicate an emphatic
pause or abrupt change in thought.

   In Mr. Webster's first definition, a hyphen is used to divide or
join words or parts of words. Thus, from the start, a hyphen is
expected to be both a divider and a unifier, which is why the
stylebook of the Oxford University Press warns, ``If you take the
hyphen seriously, you will surely go mad.''
   A hyphen also is expected to help avoid confusion, ambiguity,
absurdity, even insult. It treads on treacherous turf. Think of the
thin line that is crossed should you drop a hyphen from a
small-business man, who is not a midget.
   According to ``The Story of English,'' there are about 2,700
languages in the world, and, as with death and taxes, one assumes
the hyphen gets to most or many of them.
   More people speak Chinese than any other language, but English
is used in the most countries and, with the orbiting impact of
television and radio, comes closest to being the planetary
language. Thus, le snacque-barre found its way to Paris and, like
seksapil, dzhin-in-tonik surfaced in Moscow.
   Clearly, the hyphen is not exclusively an American or capitalist
problem, although the Chinese might be suggesting that. Baden Baden
may have escaped but not Bosnia-Hercegovina, Yugoslavia, which
belonged to Turkey until the Hapsburgs took it in 1908 and made it
part of the schizoid Austro-Hungarian Empire where the same man
ruled as emperor on one side of the hyphen and king on the other
and commanded different prime ministers in both.
   In England, whether the Tories or Socialists are in, a woman
with enough money or social clout joins her name to her husband's
with a hyphen. So might an insurance company and a fertilizer firm
in the current contagion of corporate mergers.
   Mao Tse-Tung is now Mao Zedong because the Chinese officially
changed the English phonetic spelling of Chinese names, which
caused a severe drop in the hyphen market. Revolutionary
governments tend to shed the clothes of their colonial masters.
   Ours did. ``Our honor requires us to have a system of our own,
in language as well as government,'' Noah Webster wrote before
publication of his ``American Dictionary of the English Language''
in 1828.
   We may have gone too far, as in a ``pre-dawn vertical
insertion,'' which was the White House's contribution to the
language of Shakespeare and Keats to announce a parachute drop in
Grenada.
   Through the ages, language moves with an inexorable force that
brushes aside teachers, linguists, critics and other unlicensed
arbiters. It gathers new words, it buries rejects, it accepts the
unacceptable.
   So it is with hyphens. Popular use tends to become proper use.
With time, two words eventually become one after a period of
hyphenation. Relentlessly, bed chamber snuggled into bed-chamber
until it became bedchamber.
   Stylists in the American South were in the vanguard of the
trend. Far more than a century ago, they made one word out of two,
as in damnyankee.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He compares his job to being in the middle of a
sack full of cats, and he's felt the claws lately. But Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan likes his work. His problem, aides say, is
that he thinks out loud, often getting his foot lodged in his
mouth.

   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan has started
choosing his words more carefully these days.
   His earlier off-the-cuff remarks on everything from cattle
grazing on federal lands to the Alaska oil spill provided his
critics with ample ammunition during his first 18 months in
President Bush's Cabinet.
   Some of these critics have even raised questions about his
ability to run one of the government's oldest, most broad-reaching
and powerful departments.
   ``Manuel thinks out loud, and that causes some difficulty once
in a while,'' acknowledges John Schrote, a top aide who has known
Lujan for two decades.
   But Lujan is not staying out of the spotlight.
   In back-to-back news conferences on one June day, he was the
point man for the Bush administration on its decision to restrict
offshore oil drilling and on its plan to balance the needs of the
``threatened'' spotted owl with the economics of the timber
industry.
   Environmentalists hailed the former and denounced the latter.
   The former New Mexico congressman is not unaccustomed to being
the target of environmentalists.
   ``Do we have to save every subspecies?'' Lujan asked recently in
Colorado, maintaining that the federal Endangered Species Act
should be made more flexible to accommodate economic interests in
some cases.
   Questioning environmentalists' concerns over the construction of
a $200 million telescope in Arizona that threatens an endangered
colony of red squirrels, Lujan told a reporter, ``Nobody told me
the difference between the red squirrel, a black one or a brown
one.''
   The National Wildlife Federation, Sierra Club and Wilderness
Society and other conservationists attacked Lujan. In a floor
speech Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell suggested the
Interior Secretary didn't know the endangered species law he is
supposed to implement.
   Among other things, environmentalists have criticized Lujan's
strong support for oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge, his repeated calls for more offshore oil drilling, and his
renewal of long-term water contracts in California before reviewing
their environmental impact.
   When the National Park Service produced a long study showing
that sulfur emissions from an electric power plant are polluting
the air over the Grand Canyon, the park service wanted the
Environmental Protection Agency to intervene. Lujan, instead,
referred the matter for more study by the National Academy of
Sciences.
   ``We're clearly not impressed. When the going gets tough he
punts,'' says Steve Whitney, who follows national park issues for
the Wilderness Society.
   At first glance, it's hard to envision Lujan in the midst of
such rows.
   Well-liked personally, even by his critics, the interior
secretary is easygoing, affable and without pretensions. He
resembles more the insurance agent he once was in Albuquerque than
a Cabinet member under fire.
   ``Interior is like a sack full of cats,'' Lujan says. ``You have
the mining interests, the environmental interests, the timber
interests and the recreation interests. All those different
interests and you're in the middle of that sack trying to keep
everybody away from each other.''
   All the reaction is not negative.
   Environmentalists praise his moves to revitalize some of the
national parks and some of his coal mining decisions.
   ``He's trying to do a good job. You don't judge someone on
whether he's done everything you want,'' says Paul Prichard,
president of the National Park and Conservation Association.
   Still, some of the attacks have been vicious, with critics
suggesting that Lujan may not know enough about the major issues
facing his complex and powerful department.
   ``It's too easy to look better than James Watt,'' says David
Gardner, legislative director of the Sierra Club. It was a
reference to the pro-development Reagan-era interior secretary
still widely disliked among environmentalists.
   Newspaper headlines have called Lujan the ``weak link'' in the
Bush Cabinet and a magazine article last year compared him to ``a
kinder, dimmer version'' of Watt.
   ``You don't like it when they say that, naturally,'' Lujan says.
``One is a human being and you'd rather they said nice things about
you ... But I've been in politics for 20 years and I'm no stranger
to criticism.''
   His senior aides bristle at the attacks. They charge that
environmentalists are never satisfied unless their agenda is
followed without compromise, that the Eastern press is looking for
easy headlines and that political opponents in Congress all are
eager to jump on an offhand remark.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Along the border between south Lebanon and
Israel, Israeli-armed Lebanese Christian militiamen help defend the
Jewish state against attacks by Palestinian guerrillas. An AP
correspondent who recently spent a week inside what is known as
``the zone'' filed this report.

   The gulleys and hills of this killing
ground echo with gunfire most days as guerrillas attack a Lebanese
border zone occupied by Israel and its militia ally, the South
Lebanon Army.
   At night, parachute flares fired to spot infiltrators cast a
ghostly light around the hilltop forts manned by the 3,000-strong
SLA, mostly Christians.
   ``They're human sandbags,'' says an officer of the United
Nations peacekeeping force. ``They absorb the raids and take the
casualties rather than the Israelis. In return, the Israelis arm
them, pay the bills and keep them in power.''
   The militia, backed by some 1,200 Israeli soldiers and hundreds
of security agents, man the so-called ``security zone,'' a strip of
Lebanese territory that runs north of the border from the
Mediterranean coast in the west to the foothills of Mount Hermon in
the east.
   It costs Israel $3 million a month to support the SLA, but for
them it's money well spent. In the last 4{ years, nearly 200
militia fighters have been killed and some 600 wounded defending
Israel in south Lebanon, where guerrillas fight among themselves as
much as they do the Israelis.
   Hundreds of Palestinian guerrillas and Lebanese leftist and
Moslem irregulars have been killed or wounded.
   No Israeli civilian has been slain in guerrilla raids from south
Lebanon since 1985, although the guerrillas still occasionally fire
ineffectual rocket salvos into northern Galilee.
   Still, more than 30 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the
security zone since it was established in mid-1985. That was when
the Israelis withdrew after three years of occupying a large chunk
of Lebanon, harried all the way by suicide bombers and leftist and
Moslem guerrillas.
   The zone, 6 to 10 miles deep, joins a finger of territory held
by the SLA that runs north to the Christian mountain town of
Jezzine, 15 miles above the Israeli border.
   ``Israel pays the SLA salaries and covers all our expenses,''
says Gen. Antoine Lahd, the silver-haired retired Lebanese Army
officer who commands the SLA. ``Israel provides us with all our
needs. We protect the zone and Israel's northern borders.''
   Lahd, a Maronite Catholic, says his objective is ``a normal
relationship of good neighborliness with Israel. They're our
neighbors. We don't see any point in fighting them.''
   The Israelis invaded Lebanon in June 1982 ``because Palestinians
attacked them from Lebanon,'' he says.
   ``It's our duty to prevent anyone _ the Palestinians, Iranians
and others _from using our land to attack Israel,'' Lahd said in an
interview at his heavily guarded villa in the SLA's headquarters
complex in the mountain town of Marjayoun.
   ``This way we keep our land free and we avoid Israeli reprisal
attacks against terrorists on our land.''
   The Israelis insist they do not want to stay in south Lebanon.
   The SLA emerged from a group of Christians armed by the Israelis
in 1976 to combat Palestinian guerrillas. Lahd took over command of
the SLA in 1984 after its leader, a renegade Lebanese Army major
named Saad Haddad, died of cancer.
   Lahd, 62, was wounded in November 1988 when a woman member of
the Lebanese Communist Party, who had a job as his wife's dance
instructor, shot him in an assassination attempt.
   The Lebanese government considers Lahd's force to be agents of
the Israelis who occupy Lebanese territory and show no sign of
withdrawing.
   ``But one day, when the Middle East crisis is over and the
problem of Lebanon has been settled, we'll be integrated into the
regular Lebanese armed forces,'' Lahd says. Given his cooperation
with Israel, that remains to be seen.
   The SLA is armed with obsolete Israeli tanks, artillery and
other weaponry, much of it captured from the Arabs. Lahd says the
militia is divided into two brigades of 1,500 fighters, most of
them deployed along the 72-mile northern edge of the enclave.

   Lahd's spokesman, Caesar Saqr, says the zone was attacked 353
times by infiltrators, roadside bombs, or artillery, mortar and
rocket bombardments last year, almost one a day.
   ``All the infiltration attempts were intercepted and dealt with
in the security zone,'' Saqr says.
   The SLA fighters have a reputation for poor discipline and
brutality. Most Moslems and not a few Christians consider them
Israeli mercenaries.
   An SLA private is paid $150 a month, six times the average wage
in other parts of Lebanon, and a second lieutenant gets $240.
   Lahd has sought to recruit Shiites to give his army a sectarian
mix. But many of those defected.
   The Israelis say that better training by Israeli instructors has
improved the SLA's discipline and reliability.
   The Israelis in the zone are deployed primarily in strategic
hilltop fire bases bristling with electronic surveillance equipment.
   The Israeli air force regularly attacks Palestinian and Lebanese
guerrilla bases to avenge major attacks. Israeli troops with tanks
and helicopter gunships often strike out of the zone on punitive
raids, seizing Moslem suspects.
   ``The Israelis are not an occupation army,'' Lahd insists. ``You
don't see them in the streets or villages of the security zone.
They don't interfere with the population.''
   But Shin Beth, Israel's security service, operates in the zone,
along with an estimated 750 Lebanese agents and informers, U.N.
officials say.
   Most of the estimated 200,000 people living in the
328-square-mile enclave are Moslems. The Christians total only
about 69,000 and that makes them nervous.
   Their numbers have recently been swollen by some 20,000 people
who fled fighting in the Christian enclave north of Beirut.
   Many Moslems believe that Lahd, with Israel's blessing, seeks to
turn the zone into a Christian mini-state, a perpetual buffer bound
economically to Israel. Lahd and the Israelis deny that.
   The Israelis and the SLA impose tight restrictions to combat the
guerrillas, who include Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem zealots,
pro-Syrian Lebanese and Communists.
   At entry points into the zone on the Lebanese side, everyone is
frisked. Even cigarette lighters are seized, unless they're the
transparent plastic variety, in case they contain electronic
devices.
   There's no official curfew, but few people venture out at night.
   ``You never know when you're going to get caught up in a gun
battle between the SLA and infiltrators, said one Christian, who
gave his name only as Luftallah. ``The Israelis open fire
immediately on drivers who don't pull over when their convoys are
on the move.''
   Like many other inhabitants of the zone, he pays about $5 to
anyone who'll ride with him for a day in his pickup truck
distributing butane gas cylinders. Luftallah, who hails from the
village of Qleiaam, explained that, ``Every vehicle has to have at
least two people in it because the Israelis are afraid of suicide
attacks.''
   The last such attack was on Oct. 20, 1988, when a Shiite zealot
named Abdallah Atwi detonated his explosives-packed car as he drove
past an Israeli convoy, killing himself and eight Israelis.
   The Israelis have tried to set up ``civil administrations'' in
the villages, but many Moslems refuse to recognize them.
   The militiamen, sometimes aided by Shin Beth agents, regularly
raid Shiite and Sunni Moslem villages, rounding up suspected
guerrilla sympathizers.
   The SLA prison at Khiam south of Marjayoun holds some 350 Arabs,
mostly Lebanese Shiites, in the former French colonial fortress.
Men who have been released from Khiam claim that torture, beatings
and malnutrition are commonplace.
   The inmates of Khiam have become part of the long-running drama
of Western hostages held by Iranian-backed Shiites in Lebanon. The
kidnappers have said they will free hostages if Israel releases the
Khiam prisoners, many of whom have been held as long as some of the
Western captives.

<DATELINE>KFAR KILA, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every morning some 2,500 Lebanese,
mostly women, cross into Israel through what they call ``the Good
Fence'' to go to work.
   To the Lebanese government they're traitors. But for many of the
200,000 people living in the Israeli-occupied region of south
Lebanon, working in the Jewish state means survival.
   The $1 million a month they earn is the economic lifeline for
the region that has been shunned by Lebanon's central government
since the Israelis established the so-called ``security zone'' five
years ago as a buffer against guerrilla attacks.
   ``The government in Beirut considers us collaborators with the
enemy,'' said a Shiite Moslem woman, who gave her name only as
Zainab, as she underwent security checks at Kfar Kila on her way to
work as a maid at an Israeli hotel.
   ``Beirut doesn't help us, but they don't like us working in
Israel either. We have no choice.''
   Gen. Antoine Lahd, commander of the Israeli-armed South Lebanon
Army, said, ``If Beirut sent us $1 million every month I'd stop
anyone working in Israel.''
   The Israelis set up the fence in 1976, the year after Lebanon's
civil war started, when they began cooperating with southern
Christians to curb attacks by Palestinian guerrillas based in the
region.
   The Lebanese who work in Israel earn an average $350 a month,
four times the minimum monthly wage set by the Lebanese government.
   Most of the women work in hotel kitchens, small factories or
textile plants. The men generally work as gardeners or in
construction.
   By allowing Lebanese to work in the Jewish state, the Israelis
make the zone dependent on them economically. But it also makes it
easier to recruit men for the 3,000-strong SLA which, backed by
some 1,200 Israeli soldiers, blunts attacks by guerrillas.
   ``Only SLA personnel can send a wife, a mother or a member of
their family to work in Israel,'' said a Lebanese police officer,
who declined to be identified.
   The zone is under constant attack by guerrillas. While they have
some support, particularly among the Shiite Moslems, many
inhabitants of the zone wish the guerrillas would go away.
   ``The Israelis are my enemy,'' said a schoolteacher who
identified himself only as Hassan. ``But if we allow them to fight
Israel from here, the Israelis will employ scorched earth tactics.
The people who live here have nowhere to go.''
   The policeman is one of about 200 Lebanese police officers who
operate in the zone, along with scores of administrative and
educational personnel, all local people.
   ``We only have civil duties,'' the officer said. ``The Israelis,
through their various agencies, control political security.''
   Deputy Mayor Mahfouz Mahfouz of Marjayoun, the zone's
``capital,'' lamented:
   ``We're the forgotten ones. The government doesn't send us
anything; not stationary, heating fuel, nothing. I even had to buy
the Lebanese flag in my office with my own money.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In the world of horse racing, he's remembered as
the jockey aboard the royal horse that collapsed just before
winning England's prestigious Grand National. In the publishing
world, he's known as the prolific author of nine best-sellers, all
set in the world he knows best. Meet Dick Francis, royal jockey,
thriller writer.

   Writers often deny that their novels
are in any way autobiographical. Not Dick Francis, the former royal
jockey who is one of the world's favorite thriller writers.
   ``The main characters I use in my books are autobiographical,''
Francis says. ``I am not as clever or brave as they are, but they
have my characteristics a lot.''
   Not entirely, of course. Francis has never been shot, hunted
down by a fleet of taxicabs or thrown off a balcony. But the
unvarying backdrop of his novels _ the world of horse racing _ is
very much part of his previous life as a jockey.
   Francis' newest hero is called John Kendall, and he is _ you
guessed it _ a writer. He appears in ``Longshot,'' Francis' 29th
novel, to be published in Britain and the United States this fall.
   ``Things happen,'' Francis says, impishly. ``That's all I'm
going to tell you.''
   Francis was relaxing over a cup of coffee in the living room of
Folly House, the Lambourn stable and home of his horse-trainer son,
Merrick. It is big, light and comfortable, and filled with
horse-racing pictures and half a dozen affectionate dogs and cats.
   As Dick Francis devotees ought to know, this compact, prosperous
village in rolling Berkshire about 60 miles west of London is the
heart of English steeplechasing.
   Roofs are thatched, hedges neat. Large, big-eyed hunters
clip-clop along the twisting roads.
   Francis, who lives in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., was in England for
the Grand National, England's _ if not the world's _ greatest horse
race. It's the one he never misses and the one he lost famously in
1956 while riding the Queen Mother's Devon Loch. The horse simply
collapsed in the final strides, with a clear field.
   Francis, 69, is reserved among inquisitive strangers, but polite
and unpretentious for somebody who has sold more than 20 million
books in 22 languages around the world.
   At one point Francis tried to cut down to one novel every two
years, but his publisher, Michael Joseph Ltd. of London, wouldn't
have it.
   The youngest of two sons, Francis was born into a horse-racing
family in south Wales, and rode a donkey at age 5 _ ``the first
mount I had.''
   Missing school regularly for hunts and competitions, he left
altogether at age 15 to help his father, a horse dealer. He wanted
to be a jockey, but his parents balked. ``They knew all the trials
and tribulations.''
   After World War II, in which he flew bombers, Francis became a
gofer for a Cheshire trainer, George Owen. Like his father, he was
too big for flat races. But in that yard he became an amateur
steeplechase rider and within 18 months went professional.
   His riding career flourished and in 1953 Francis joined trainer
Peter Cazalet's yard, where Queen Mother Elizabeth kept her horses.
Cazalet gave him two bits of advice Francis remembers vividly:
Always ride to win and never look around in the final stretch.
   Francis became the Queen Mum's No. 1 jockey for four seasons and
during the 1953-1954 season he realized one of his two great
ambitions: to be champion jockey by winning the most races that
year.
   The other, to win the Grand National, proved more elusive.
   Francis blames Devon Loch's collapse on the stunning roar of the
crowd excited by the prospect of the first royal win since 1900.
   ``As I was in mid-air over the last jump, I could hear this
crescendo building up,'' Francis says. ``I was just riding out with
my hands and heels. The horse just collapsed under me.
   ``I had to get off him and walk away in disgust. It was a
terrible moment.''
   Hurtling around courses, Francis broke his collarbone 12 times,
his nose five times, his back, his skull, his wrist and numerous
ribs.
   As his bones took longer to knit, he got out of racing, on top,
in January 1957. He was 36 and in 10 years as a jockey had won a
creditable 345 out of 2,305 races.
   He wrote his autobiography, ``Sport of Queens,'' and was racing
correspondent for the Daily Express for 16 years.
   His wife, Mary Francis, prodded him into writing his first novel
to help pay for their two sons' school fees and replace a
threadbare carpet.
   ``Dead Cert'' was published in 1962 and Francis immediately
found his formula: a gallant, idiosyncratic hero with a tie to
horse-racing. A ``dirty deed,'' as he calls it. Suspense. Some
bone-crunching violence. A little romance. Triumph over evil. A
bittersweet ending.
   Poet Philip Larkin once praised ``the absolute sureness of his
settings, the freshness of his characters, the terrifying climaxes
of violence, the literate jauntiness of style, the unfailing
intelligent compassion...''
   More recently, critics have occasionally found his powers
flagging. But to have pulled off nine best-sellers, all set in the
narrow world of horses, is an unusual achievement. Since ``Whip
Hand,'' which was published in 1981, all his books have made the
American best-seller list.
   To broaden his field, Francis now focuses each novel on a
specific subject, diligently researched _ banking, photography,
computers _ and takes his readers to new locations such as Canada
and the Soviet Union.
   Francis says he pays no attention to critics, and he doesn't
pretend to write great literature.
   In 1986, the Francises moved to a condominium in Fort Lauderdale
because his wife, who suffers from asthma, could no longer tolerate
the English climate. Francis visits England three times a year. He
usually begins a book in January, finishes it in May, and spends
the rest of the year traveling and researching his next novel.
   Francis usually takes a long morning walk and goes for a swim.
Then he writes by hand for five hours _ ``I like to see a sentence
on a page, see how it flows'' _ and finally copies his words into a
word processor.
   But writing's rewards last longer. ``Winning a race, there's the
immediate satisfaction where people hit you on the back and say,
`Well done.' But you go out half an hour later and you go end over
end,'' he said.
   But books are talked about, he said. ``Nowadays, it's `Ah yes,
Dick Francis.' I'm known worldwide. Before it was `Dick Francis,
the chap who didn't win the Grand National'.''

   Isabella Hofmann, who stars as Kate on NBC's
``Dear John,'' likes to return to her hometown of Chicago to do
theater work.
   In fact, she's just back from a one-month appearance at the
Goodman Theatre in Chekhov's ``Uncle Vanya.''
   ``Chicago is one of the few remaining theater towns where the
work and the process is important,'' she says. ``In Hollywood, the
finished product is the most important thing. A play is never
finished, it's always growing.
   ``It was wonderful to be back on the stage. I hope I don't have
to wait another two years before I do another play.''
   Hofmann, the daughter of German immigrants, got her start on the
stage in Chicago and with the Second City troupe.
   ``Dear John'' centers on the relationships of a group of
divorced people who meet for support at the One-Two-One Club.
Usually in an ensemble comedy the star is the calm center, but Judd
Hirsch as the John of the title can be as off-the-wall as the
others. Kate is the calmest and most normal of the bunch.
   ``I think Kate is the character most people identify with,''
says Hofmann. ``John is more quirky, more of a victim. Kate is the
most neutral. I think people reflect on their own experiences
through her.''
   The background of her character is that she put her husband
through medical school, and when he became a successful plastic
surgeon he dumped her. But beyond that, very little is known about
Kate.
   In the first season, Kate and John were romantically involved,
but the romance has cooled. They are now just good friends.
   The show also stars Jane Carr, Jere Burns, Harry Groener and
Billie Bird. Susan Walters will join the show in the fall season.
   The comedy finished its first season last year in 11th place
behind ``Cheers'' on NBC's highly successful Thursday comedy
lineup. In January, NBC moved the show to Wednesday and it ended
the season in 18th place. Counting just its Wednesday appearances,
it was in 27th place.
   NBC's ``official'' explanation for the move was to bolster the
Wednesday night ratings, which it has. Unofficially, the move was
to make room for ``Grand,'' a new show from Carsey-Werner
Productions, makers of NBC's monster hit ``The Cosby Show.''
   The series is the first for Hofmann, who had made guest
appearances in such shows as ``Head of the Class,'' ``Matlock,''
``Night Court'' and ``Beauty and the Beast.'' She'd also been in
several movies of the week and the theatrical movie ``Real Men.''
   What got her out of Chicago was a role in an NBC movie pilot
called ``Independence.''
   ``I played an Irish immigrant who ran a boarding house for
miners,'' she says. ``It was a Western that we made in Santa Fe,
N.M. John Bennett Perry played the sheriff. I learned to ride a
horse. I went out with the wranglers every morning.
   Next she worked in the movie `Real Men' and was in an episode of
`Head of the Class.' Then she didn't work for six months.
   Hofmann had a series development deal with MTM Enterprises. ``My
contract was almost up,'' she says. ``I wrote a treatment they were
interested in. Then the script for `Dear John' sort of happened at
my agent's office. It was so funny I wanted to do it. Apparently,
they had been reading people for the role. It happened very
quickly.''
   After she did the pilot and was waiting for the network pickup,
she married actor Steven Memel.
   ``Steven's an actor, musician, writer, so many things,'' she
says. ``We met while doing a play in Chicago, Isaac Beshevis
Singer's `Teibele and Her Demon.'''
   Her husband is also just back from doing a play. He spent 2{
months performing in ``Tamara'' in Italy.

   Larry Bryggman is a cardiologist by day, a
dentist by night.
   Bryggman is, of course, an actor.
   He has been a villainous cardiologist on the TV soap opera ``As
the World Turns'' for 21 years and is now in ``Prelude to a Kiss,''
a Broadway hit at the Helen Hayes Theater.
   He plays Dr. Boyle, a New Jersey dentist who is the father of a
young woman who exchanges souls with an old man at her wedding
reception. The main characters are the young couple, played by
Mary-Louise Parker and Timothy Hutton. Barnard Hughes plays the old
man.
   In ``As the World Turns,'' Bryggman's Dr. Dixon has endured
while some characters have been written out.
   ``I've been there so long I have a value to them now,'' he says.
``I think Dr. Dixon has been married six times. For the longest
time he was married to the same woman. Then all of a sudden he
started marrying everybody. They change writers and writers write
differently.''
   As a stage actor, Bryggman has been quite versatile.
   ``I think you should feel you can do anything that comes
along,'' he says. ``But you should know what you project and what
you do well.''
   When he was growing up in Concord, Calif., where his father made
neon signs, Bryggman wanted to be a musician.
   ``My mother was a piano teacher and I studied piano from the
year one,'' he says. ``When I got into school I started taking
other instruments, woodwinds and percussion. I was in all the bands
and orchestras through school. I played in a group of my own in
pubs around town.
   ``I just decided one day to try acting and I did a couple of
shows in high school. I liked it. When I graduated I enrolled at
the City College of San Francisco as a drama major.
   ``Within two years I was in New York. A lot of my friends went
south to Los Angeles to movies. I didn't want to do that. I always
wanted to be in the theater.''
   The first thing Bryggman auditioned for in New York was a soap
opera, to replace an actor who was going to Vietnam. They said
they'd hire him but he should check with his draft board. He did
and his induction papers had been mailed that day. He spent the
next two years in the Army.
   Back in New York in 1969, his agent sent him to read for an
``under five'' on ``As the World Turns.'' ``That means less than
five lines,'' he explains.
   When the ``under five'' became far more than five, ``My attitude
and my agent's attitude was, it was a good part-time job that I
needed to make enough money to support my hobby, which is the
theater.
   ``This TV show has been good for me. I've not had to go to
California to live.''
   Before ``Prelude to a Kiss'' opened on May 1, Bryggman was
Banquo in Shakespeare's ``Macbeth'' at the Public Theater. ``Joe
Papp called my agent and offered me the job,'' he says.
   ``I thought, `Have I finally reached that magical place where I
don't have to audition any more?' I don't think that's true.''
   Bryggman played one of the tribunes _ ``one of the slick guys
who went around and caused all the trouble'' _ in ``Coriolanus,''
directed by Steven Berkoff.
   ``In `The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel,' Al Pacino and I had
the whole first act,'' he recalls. ``But I wasn't in the second act
at all.''
   He also was in Pacino's ``Richard III'' on Broadway.
   Bryggman played Pozzo in an off-Broadway production of ``Waiting
for Godot'' for six months.
   A year ago, Bryggman had a 56-minute monologue in Terrence
McNally's ``Prelude and Liebestod'' off-off-Broadway. A conductor
speaks his thoughts while conducting ``Tristan und Isolde.'' He
hopes it'll be done again next season off-Broadway.
   Bryggman, whose name is Swedish, is a member of the
off-off-Broadway Manhattan Class Company, which staged ``Prelude
and Liebestod.'' ``We take a play from its early draft and stay
with it right on through,'' he says. ``It's great to work with the
playwright. I like working on new material. I like the attitude and
spirit there.''
   In his personal life, Bryggman has two ex-wives and three
children, a daughter, 29, who works for Home Box Office in
California, a son, 24, studying film scoring at the Berklee College
of Music in Boston and a son, 20, installing burglar alarms on Long
Island.
   He lives in Manhattan with a Scotch terrier and has a 30-acre
farm, with 10 acres in crops, in upstate New York. ``I try to take
care of it myself,'' he says. ``Another fellow helps me with
plowing and cutting.
   ``We do a Sunday matinee and I get to the farm about 8. I jump
on the tractor and cut a back field by 10:30 with the lights on. I
get up at 6 Monday and start work, finishing by 7 that evening.
   ``The neighbors all must stand around and laugh, `The crazy
actor's back here again.'''

<HEAD>Alcoholism Among the Elderly Largely Undetected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL BASKERVILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A preoccupation with treating alcoholism in
younger people has obscured a serious and neglected problem among
old people in this country, experts say.
   ``Alcoholism in the elderly is drastically underdetected and
undertreated,'' said Nancy J. Osgood, a Medical College of Virginia
gerontologist. ``We have a hard time thinking a person 85 years old
could have an alcohol problem.''
   Ms. Osgood and officials of the Virginia Department for the
Aging have developed what they say is the nation's first statewide
program to detect alcoholism in the elderly.
   About 100 two-member teams of volunteers will receive a day of
intensive training from the state, and each team in turn will train
125 people. The first training session was in February; another is
set for September.
   The goal is to have 12,500 relatives of older alcoholics, older
adults and social service and health professionals versed in the
physical and psychological effects of alcohol and aging.
   Delaware is setting up a detection program, using Virginia as a
model, Ms. Osgood said.
   Rita Albery, a public health adviser to the National Institute
on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, said the focus has been on
alcoholism in younger people but not in older people.
   ``We've got to start paying attention to this population,'' she
said.
   Studies have found that 2 percent to 10 percent of Americans
over 65 are alcoholics, or 560,000 to 2.8 million people. But the
statistics are misleading because the problem is largely
undetected, said Ms. Osgood.
   ``The elderly don't usually come in contact with work officials
or even with family members because they live alone,'' she said.
   Many older people also grew up believing alcoholism was a moral
issue _ instead of a chronic disease _ and that overcoming it was a
matter of will power. This makes it hard for older people to seek
help.
   It's sometimes difficult for physicians to distinguish symptoms
of alcoholism _ such as memory loss and blackouts _ from the
natural aging process, Ms. Osgood said. Many physicians also are
reluctant to recognize alcoholism in the elderly or to confront an
older patient, she said.
   Elderly alcoholics themselves can make diagnosis difficult.
   ``Alcoholics can hide it from anybody. It's a real hidden
disease,'' said Ms. Osgood, who has written extensively on
geriatric alcoholism, depression and suicide.
   A more insidious barrier to detecting and treating alcoholism
among the elderly is an attitude of ``the bottle is the only thing
they have left ... why take it away from them,'' Ms. Osgood said.
``They're really the ones we should be taking it away from.''
   J. James Cotter, director for program development and management
for the Department for the Aging, agreed.
   ``There is a tendency to use age as a justification for not
seeking stronger intervention and providing help,'' he said.
   Taken to a further extreme, some people believe, ``why treat it,
they're going to die anyway,'' Ms. Osgood said. ``It's a crazy kind
of rationalization.''
   Among the clues to alcoholism in the elderly are repeated falls,
gaps in memory, confusion, a flushed face, trembling, weight loss,
extreme fatigue, incontinence, aggressive or abusive behavior and
depression.
   The goals of intervention are to allow a person to become aware
of the problem, to build the alcoholic's motivation to recover and
to help the alcoholic overcome fears of the disease and treatment.
Intervention may take only a single meeting or many visits over a
period of months.
   An irony of the failure to detect alcoholism in old people is
that they have a better treatment prognosis than other age groups,
Ms. Osgood said.
   Most geriatric alcoholism is related to a specific problem,
crisis or stress related to aging rather than to a lifetime of
drinking, she said.
   Still, elderly alcoholics are more at risk for associated
illnesses such as liver damage and gastrointestinal problems
because their bodies are weaker.
   Another physical threat is the sometimes lethal reaction between
alcohol and prescription drugs.
   Cotter said geriatric alcoholism will worsen as life expectancy
increases.
   ``It's going to cost a fortune to take care of elderly
alcoholics,'' Ms. Osgood said. ``The drain on social services and
the health care system in terms of money will be extremely high.''
   ``The human cost in terms of quality of life'' will be even
higher, she said. Ms. Osgood said she believes the increase in
elderly suicides is tied to alcoholism, although there has been no
definitive research on the subject.
   As with geriatric suicide, alcoholism among the elderly
primarily targets men. Male alcoholics make up 88 percent of the
elderly who are receiving treatment.
   ``In our society men, more than women, have held positions of
power, status and authority. So when they become old and lose their
jobs and income and the status and power, they've got the farthest
to fall,'' Ms. Osgood said.
   Social history may also make alcoholism harder to spot among
elderly women.
   ``I think ... we probably have many more women alcoholics than
we've recognized because traditionally we haven't even had programs
for women alcoholics,'' she said. ``As a society we say nice women
don't drink. We don't want to admit that our grandmother is an
alcoholic.''

<HEAD>Generation of Retarded People Surviving Parents</HEAD>
<HEAD>By CATHERINE WILSON</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 3 percent of America's older
population have been called the ``sheltered generation,'' mentally
retarded senior citizens who outlive their parents.
   ``We're not prepared,'' said John Stokesbury, director of the
University of Miami's Center on Aging and Developmental
Disabilities. ``The professional and social service community is
not prepared to suddenly deal with someone who is orphaned at age
60.''
   Long before the 1960s push for special education, parents chose
whether to send their children to an insane asylum or keep them
home. Many families who kept their children at home dealt little
with the social service system and haven't planned for their own
deaths.
   In Florida, social service agencies are aware of 1,500 adults
with any of about 200 lifelong developmental disabilities ranging
from Down's syndrome to autism to cerebral palsy. But some social
service workers believe the actual population is closer to 15,000.
   ``Many of these parents realize there's a problem. They never
thought their child would outlive them,'' said Stokesbury, a state
social service worker and administrator for 18 years. ``The doctors
said their children wouldn't live past their teens. But they did.''
   Many developmentally disabled people are susceptible to
respiratory diseases, but antibiotics virtually eliminated
pneumonia as a fatal illness. Congenital heart problems were
repaired with surgery. Lifespans were stretched.
   An increasing focus on the aging of American society drew
attention to this overlooked group and pushed federal agencies for
the aging and developmentally disabled last year to jointly fund
research work for the first time.
   At the University of Miami's medical school, the center is
trying to identify the ``sheltered generation'' born from the 1920s
to 1940s, develop an advocacy program and train professionals to
deal with them.
   The center is asking home meal delivery groups, churches,
physicians and others with direct family contact to help.
   Parents can be briefed on guardianship and financial planning to
ease their children through the emotional crisis of their deaths.
   ``The big problems are accessibility to adequate, appropriate
and affordable health care because there's not a critical mass of
physicians trained in gerontology and developmental disabilities,''
Stokesbury said. ``The majority of doctors treating mentally
retarded adults are pediatricians.''
   Adult day-care has become relatively common for the elderly, but
Stokesbury said there is opposition to accepting developmentally
disabled clients in the same programs.
   Researchers nationally are looking at legal issues, recreation
and leisure activities, training programs and special concerns for
rural elderly to produce some policy direction.

<HEAD>Couple About to Become Great-Grandparents Reflects on the Past</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES E. WALTERS</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   My wife, Virginia, and I were born in the 1920s.
She never had a glimpse of her grandparents. I have vague
recollections of one _ my mother's father, who died when I was 5.
   Now Susan and Michael Springer of Canyon Country, Calif., have
anounced we are to become great-grandparents. After the spontaneous
outrush of joy, the full implication of the aging of America
smashed in. And if two kids who began dating in high school get the
chance, what lasting impression do Virigina and I want to leave
with our first great-grandchild?
   My reporter's instincts always have been tantalizied by the
lives of my grandparents. If only I could have interviewed them.
   Anders Valter (the name was changed to Andrew Walters at Ellis
Island) was 39 when he left Sweden in the 1880s with a wife and
three daughters (Two children were born in this country, including
my dad). I have the 15-inch jardiniere grandmother Mathilda brought
with her. What would induce her to take such an impractical but
beautiful, piece of porcelain in the 10 cubic feet of steerage
luggage allowed the family? Did my grandfather know before they
left?
   Anders Erikson, my maternal grandfather who became Andrew W.
Ericson, came alone from Sweden about the same time. I have his
contract of passage. He paid $35.74 in U.S. currency. For that he
was assured he would sail in steerage by way of England to New York
City and be carried by train to Porter, Ind., all this ``with good
and sufficient food and hotel accommodations where called for.''
   In 1892, he won a gold medal at the World's Fair. I have a
postal card, apparently as mass advertisement, showing him and his
``refrigerator,'' an ornate box using ice for the coolant.
   His wife, Emma, was born at Porter. Her death, at 42, rated a
long front-page story in the daily newspaper at Michigan City,
Ind., where the Ericsons and Walters then lived. But the story,
also among my possessions, says only that she was known for many
good works in the community, without specifying.
   When our parents were born around the turn of this century, life
expectancy was about 50 years. Today it's 75. Many chldren know
their grandparents, some their great-grandparents.
   However, the mother of Virginia's mother died from complications
of childbirth. The father died a few years later. My future
mother-in-law was raised by relatives. Those three events were
common at that time. My wife's father immigrated from Poland.
Virginia remembers receiving small packages of Polish hard candy
once a year from her grandmother until World War II began. Nothing
afterward.
   Virginia's dad was fluent in eight languages, including Russian,
German and Polish. In Indiana, he managed a factory. But he was
vague about Poland and the reason for his linguistic skills. Was he
involved in revolutionary activities and had to flee for his life,
as a relative later told me?
   Except for vital statistics such as birth, marriage and death
records, that's about all I can tell my grandchildren _ three boys
and three girls _ of their great-grandparents. Will my
great-grandchild want to hear my stories? I can hardly wait.
   Actually, my own great-grandad may have warned me against
smoking marijuana. I'm going to check courthouse records to see if
I can find out when I visit Indiana later this summer. As a
youngster, I went to Porter often to visit ``Grandpa Swanson.'' My
grandmother Emma's maiden name was Swanson, so he could have been
her father. He couldn't have been my grandfather. Family lines were
blurred in those days, and most of us had dozens of ``aunts'' and
``uncles.''
   Once in a while he would tell stories about the Civil War or
Indians. On rare occasions he would take a troop of youngsters for
short walks. On one he pointed to a weed growing alongside a ditch
on his farm and said something like this:
   ``Years ago, when the Pottawatomie Indians lived around here,
they would sit around their evening campfire and some would smoke
this. Now I know you boys and girls are going to try smoking
sometime. It's not a good idea. But if you do, stick to cornsilks
and tobacco. The Indians who smoked this stuff would go real
crazy.''
   Maybe it was because his delivery was so impressive. Maybe we
were so impressionable. But so far as I know, none of us ever tried.
   A Swedish immigrant, he also told of fighting with the Indiana
volunteers at Gettysburg, arriving by forced march on the third day
of the battle.
   ``There were bodies in blue and gray uniforms all over,'' he
said. ``The smell was terrible. The flies came from miles away,
thousands of them. The Army fed us hardtack spread with honey. At
first we tried to pick them off, but two would land for every one
we picked off. Finally, we gave up and ate it, flies and all.''
   Years later, I went to Gettysburg and stood where he must have
been. It was beautiful and peaceful. But in my mind all I could see
where hungry soldiers eating fly-covered honey and crackers.
   I never have been sure of his first name. But each Fourth of
July, when I was a boy, he would dress in his blue uniform and ride
at or near the head of the local parade. Once, at the cemetery, I
saw tears flood down his cheeks when the bugler played taps.

<HEAD>Planning Can Lessen Stress of Hospital Stay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DR. T. FRANKLIN WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For many of us, going to the hospital is
somewhat like traveling to a foreign country _ the sights are not
familiar, the language sounds strange, and the people wear unusual
costumes.
   No matter what the reason for the trip _ whether it's an
overnight visit for tests or a longer stay for medical treatment or
major surgery _ entering the hospital may be worrisome.
   In my experience, knowing about hospitals and the people who
work there and planning can make the trip less stressful.
   The following hints are meant especially for those who know in
advance they'll be going to the hospital and therefore have time to
prepare. Relatives and friends of people who are admitted to a
hospital because of an emergency also may find this information
useful.
   Take as little as possible with you. However, be sure to pack
the following: a list of the medicines you are taking (prescription
and non-prescription drugs); details of past illnesses, surgeries,
and any allergies; your health insurance card; telephone numbers of
relatives to contact in an emergency; and a few personal items such
as nightclothes, toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo and deodorant.
   Leave money, jewelry (including wedding rings and watches),
credit cards, and checkbooks at home or have a family member or
friend keep them. If you must take valuables, ask if they can be
kept in the hospital safe.
   If possible, ask a relative or friend to go with you to the
hospital for support.
   While there, you'll have an attending physician, who directs
your overall care. In a teaching hospital, you'll also be treated
by medical students and residents, doctors who have graduated from
medical school and are continuing their training.
   Registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and aides give
medicines, check your blood pressure, and provide other services.
Physical, occupational and respiratory therapists also may be
involved in your care, as well as the hospital dietition,
pharmicist and social worker.
   In some hospitals, a team that includes a doctor, a nurse, a
social worker and other specialists performs a thorough review and
examination, called a geriatric assessment, to learn about your
physical and mental health, family life, income, living
arrangements, access to community services and ability to perform
daily tasks such as dressing and preparing meals.
   The team not only diagnoses health problems but also develops a
plan to make sure you receive appropriate health care and social
services on a continuing basis.
   Before leaving the hospital, you can arrange for home care. A
service called discharge planning is offered in the hospital so
that, if needed, a visiting nurse, hospital equipment, meals-on
wheels or other services will be there when you go home.
   The discharge planner also knows about senior centers, nursing
homes and other long-term care facilities in your community.
   In the event of a serious illness or accident, it's vital to
seek medical help right away. In many areas, you can reach
emergency help by calling 911 or the telphone operator. Be sure to
tell the operator the type of emergency and your location.
   If you have a minor injury or your symptoms aren't severe, call
your doctor or a nearby clinic before going to the emergency room.
Sometimes an emergency room visit isn't necessary. If it is, your
doctor can make things easier by calling the hospital to let them
know you're coming. Your doctor also may arrange to meet you there.
   If there's time, try to take your health insurance card or
policy number, your doctor's name and telephone number, a list of
the medicines you take, information about other medical problems,
and the telephone numbers of close relatives.
   It's helpful to record and keep this information on a note card
you can carry in your wallet or purse. If you have a particular
medical problem such as diabetes, epilepsy or allergies, you should
wear an ID bracelet or necklace or carry an ID card to let rescue
workers and hospital personnel know about these conditions.

<HEAD>Shortcuts to a Fruitful Garden</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BRIA</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As time goes by, some of us become
shortcut gardeners _ happy to have found ways to lighten the work
load and still enjoy the fruits of the soil.
   Viewed from this angle, the novice toils unnecessarily with
spade and hoe, machinery, heavy bags of fertilizer. The veteran
lets nature do much of the work.
   Back in the 1950s, a Connecticut gardener named Ruth Stout wrote
a book called ``How to Have a Green Thumb Without an Aching Back,''
which became the bible of the lazy gardener. Basically, what Ms.
Stout did was to cover her vegetable garden with a permanent
eight-inch layer of hay and dump her daily kitchen scraps on top of
that.
   Ms. Stout _ a sister of detective story writer Rex Stout _ also
tossed leaves, grass clippings, uprooted weeds and other plant
wastes on the pile, all of which gradually decayed and turned into
rich topsoil. The thick cover _ called mulch _ also stifled weeds.
When planting, Ms. Stout pushed aside the mulch and, after the
seeds sprouted, pulled it back around the seedlings.
   The process goes all year round. In winter, the kitchen garbage
gets tossed on the snow. This is organic gardening with a
vengeance. In effect, your compost heap is your garden, so you
don't have to build up and keep a separate compost heap.
Practitioners never have to turn up the soil in fall or spring,
never have to pull up a weed.
   Now, grateful as we are to Ms. Stout, not all of us want to look
at banana peels on the snow. Out in the county where I live, my
vegetable garden is the first thing people see when they come up
the drive. My wife is great for vegetables _ sun most of the day
and good drainage on a slight slope. But she draws a line at
eggshells and coffee grains.
   Sacrificing the garbage, a mulch gardener can still achieve
pretty much the same results with a deep cover of leaves, grass
clippings and _ with money _ bales of salt hay available at
nurseries. The yellow hay makes a pretty background for the
vegetables. Wood ashes, or lime, occasionally mixed in with the
leaves, insure against the danger of acidity.
   Having eliminated tilling and weeding, a lazy gardener soon
finds additional ways to reduce work. The plants themselves will
help, if you know the ones you can count on. Perennials, like
asparagus and rhubarb, need only the initial planting. After that
they come up year after year. All you do is harvest them.
   Most vegetables are annuals, however, needing to be sowed anew
every year. Of those, broccoli is my ideal labor-saving crop.
Planted early in spring in my southern New York garden, broccoli
produces a large head in late June or early July. After this is
harvested, the plant keeps yielding side shoots, or florets, deep
into the frosts of fall, with little or no attention fro me. And
broccoli ranks high on nutrition charts, a powerhouse of vitamins
and minerals.
   I save much work by letting tomatoes sprawl on the salt hay
instead of staking them. And I include a few tomatoes of
indeterminate varieties, like Yellow Pear, which yield all season
long instead of all at once. Pole limas, unlike the bush varieties,
also keep yielding until frost.
   Many lettuces respond well to cut-and-come-again harvesting. At
maturity, you cut the plant at near soil level and the stump will
come back and give you another harvest. Plants like Swiss chard and
New Zealand spinach also are season-long performers. A fine beet is
Winter Keeper. It can stay in the ground for months and never lose
its flavor.
   A gardener who prefers his exercise on the tennis court or golf
course also learns to plant sparingly. Nine tomato plants will do
handsomely. Who needs to lug baskets of produce out of the garden
and then try to give them away to the neighbors?

<HEAD>Survey: Elderly Consumers More Trusting than the Young</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Older Americans, who acquired their buying
habits in a more trusting era, are less knowledgeable than the
young about their rights as consumers, a survey shows.
   The survey, conducted for the American Association of Retired
Persons, shows that while 62 percent of people under 65 believe
businesses try to mislead consumers at least half the time, only 44
percent of older people say that is true.
   Of those older than 65, only 36 percent said they knew a buyer
has several days to cancel a purchase made from a door-to-door
sales person, and only 28 percent said they knew consumers are not
liable for all charges to a stolen credit card prior to notifying
the company.
   ``Older consumers' buying habits were formed during a time when
a more trusting relationship existed between the sellers and buyers
of goods and services,'' said Horace B. Deets, the association's

<HEAD>Elderly Black City Dwellers May Live Longer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New evidence suggests that once they reach 75,
big-city black Americans live longer and go to nursing homes less
often than whites of the same age.
   On the other hand, elderly blacks are more likely to develop
diabetes, high blood pressure and glaucoma.
   The study on race-related differences among the elderly was
supported by the National Institute on Aging and is reported in the
July issue of ``The Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences.''
   The study involved 1,598 urban dwellers aged 65 and over.
Initial interviews were conducted in 1975, and 645 survivors were
re-interviewed in 1984.
   Although interviewers rated elderly whites as more physically
impaired _ 40.9 percent to 31.2 percent _ blacks rated their own
physical health more unfavorably than did whites.

<HEAD>The Elderly in Popular Music: `Over the Hill to the Poor House'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Popular sheet music issued in the United
States from 1830 to 1980 shows a clear preference for youth and
often portrays the elderly with fear, concern and ridicule, a study
shows.
   Reviewing more than 15,000 pieces of sheet music and titles,
reviewers Elias S. Cohen and Anna L. Kruschwitz of the Community
Services Institute Inc., of Narbeth, Pa., said a substantial
majority of those dealing specifically with the elderly showed them
in a distinctly negative light.
   ``Old age is seen more as a time of failing capacities and
diminished status than as a time of fulfillment and the `golden
years,' '' Cohen said.
   Fear of old age, he said, is seen in such titles as ``The
Withered Tree,'' issued in 1850, and 1874's ``Over the Hill to the
Poor House.''
   The cover art illustrating many pieces of sheet music shows an
exaggerated view of age,'' the study said.
   In ``Happy Family Polka,'' written in 1851, grandchildren of no
more than 8 or 9 years old are shown. The parents appear to be in
their early 30s, but the grandparents, who logically would be in
their 50s, are shown as they would appear in their 70s or 80s.
   The study was published in the June issue of The Gerontologist.

   As President Bush welcomes leaders of the world's
seven richest industrial democracies for their annual economic
summit, the United States is adjusting to a new role in an era
where economic power counts more than military might.
   While the Western allies were once willing to let the United
States set the agenda, the summit countries seem willing, even
eager, to chart their own courses now that America's nuclear
umbrella no longer seems crucial.
   ``1990 is the first year after the end of the Cold War,'' said
Michael Mandelbaum of the Council on Foreign Relations. ``The
American nuclear surplus will be less and less important and the

   The nation's unemployment rate edged downward

   Fewer Americans looking for work _ not any rebound in sluggish

   Shearson agreed to pay the fine without admitting or denying

   According to the NYSE, Shearson violated exchange rules in 1986
by failing to announce on the exchange floor as it bought a 4.9

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Rep. James McClure Clarke is being
cast by the Republican Party as one of ``the worst violators of the
public trust'' in the savings and loan crisis.
   Why? The North Carolina lawmaker voted last year to let the
industry continue investing in junk bonds. So did 113 other House
members, none of whom were criticized for that on the GOP hit list.
   Clarke is one of the politicians caught in the crossfire as
Democrats develop the theme they hope to ride to the White House in
1992, and Republicans respond with fusillades of their own.
   The result is a spotlight on a handful of House members facing
the voters this fall. And some of them aren't too happy about the
escalating party rhetoric.
   ``Making a political football of it is not going to solve the
problem,'' said Rep. Charles Pashayan, R-Calif. His Democratic
challenger consulted with party strategists in Washington and came
out swinging on S&amp;Ls.
   ``Frankly, from my standpoint, there is enough blame to go
around to everybody,'' said Rep. Doug Barnard of Georgia, one of
the Democrats on the GOP list. ``In all fairness, they ought to
take that off the board _ both Democrats and Republicans.''
   Both parties acknowledge a few members of Congress are
vulnerable on S&amp;Ls. But the Democrats aren't about to soft-pedal a
promising national strategy and the Republicans can't take the
assault lying down.
   ``To me this is apples and oranges,'' said Democratic Party
Chairman Ronald Brown. ``On the one hand, you have accusations
against individuals. On the other, you have the question of whose
policies allowed this mess to happen. And there is no doubt in my
mind that this happened because of Republican economic policies.''
   The Democrats, though taking a broad-brush approach, are not
ignoring individual Republicans with S&amp;L problems. Pashayan is one
example.
   The Fresno congressman is under fire for trying to block
restrictions on risky thrift investments and taking $26,000 in
contributions from former S&amp;L operator Charles Keating and his
friends. Pashayan said his actions have not been influenced by
S&amp;L-related contribution, but he returned the money.
   The national GOP strategy has been to defend President Bush's
handling of the $300 billion-plus bailout and, when provoked, point
fingers at Congress and individual Democrats.
   The Republican National Committee hastily compiled its list of
10 alleged ``violators of the public trust'' after learning that
Brown was launching an S&amp;L offensive at a June 29-30 meeting of
state party chairmen.
   Among those named were the four Democrats among the Keating Five
_ senators under investigation for accepting hundreds of thousands
of dollars from Keating and his S&amp;L associates, then allegedly
lobbying regulators to keep his failing S&amp;L open. None of the five
is up for re-election this year.
   The GOP case against Barnard and Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill.,
both Keating beneficiaries and heads of subcommittees dealing with
S&amp;Ls, is that they protected the industry while the crisis was
developing. Both deny it.
   Rep. Steve Neal, D-N.C., made the list for sponsoring a 1987
amendment that Republicans claimed was too nice to S&amp;Ls. He
disputes the interpretation and says he's targeted because his
re-election races are always tough.
   ``They're going to try this stuff to confuse the issue and pass
the buck, but ultimately they cannot do it, because it was their
main philosophy,'' said Neal, another banking subcommittee
chairman. ``It was a conscious decision on their part not to
supervise this industry.''
   Neal's Republican opponent didn't raise the S&amp;L issue until the
GOP list appeared. But Neal says the Democrats should stay on the
offensive _ even if he gets hit by a stray shot.
   ``They ought to tell the truth about it and let the chips fall
where they may,'' he said. He added: ``I don't feel caught in it
myself. Anything they say about me on this, they are saying the
same thing about a whole lot of Republicans.''
   Clarke, who is not involved with banking policy, appeared to be
on the S&amp;L list because he won his last race by just 1,529 votes.
   ``We were automatically destined for the Republican hit list and
always have been. So they fished around for this S&amp;L-related
thing,'' said Terry Garren, Clarke's administrative assistant.
   Garren said they should have fished around for something else.
He said the same type of ammunition can be used against Clarke's
Republican challenger, Charles Taylor, a banker.
   ``I guarantee you positively, just like Federal Express, that
they're going to hear about it,'' Garren promised.

<TEXT>
   France's largest retailer, Galeries Lafayette,
has signed a lease in Trump Tower reportedly worth millions of
dollars to developer Donald Trump.
   The lease to create the first Galeries Lafayette branch in the
United States should increase Trump Tower's value and strengthen
the financially troubled developer's credit standing. It was
announced by Trump today.
   The New York Times reported that the lease is for 25 years.
Trump and Georges Meyer, chairman of the department store, declined
at a news conference to comment on the term or price of the
agreement. The newspaper put the value in the tens of millions of
dollars.
   Trump's commercial and residential skyscraper is located on
Manhattan's fashionable Fifth Avenue. Meyer said the lease is for
80,000 square feet.
   The site had been occupied by Bonwit Teller. Trump bought out
Bonwit's 12-year lease for about $5 million after the store's
parent company, L.J. Hooker Co., filed for bankruptcy.
   Galeries Lafayette is second only to Harrods of London among
Europe's largest department stores. Meyer said its Trump Tower
store will concentrate on fashion, cosmetics and accessories. It is
to open in fall 1991.
   ``For French people, America is the place to be. New York is the
place to be in America. And Trump Tower is the place to be in New
York,'' said Meyer.
   Trump said the agreement was ``a wonderful thing for New York
City. A great department store from Paris is coming to New York _
one of the great stores of the world.''

   This is a very important week in economic
affairs, not just because of the economic summit in Houston but
because the week's dosage of key indicators will be released on
Friday the 13th.
   Sensible people understand that the coincidence doesn't ensure
the figures will be bad, but such a degree of uncertainty exists
these days that you cannot be complacent. Securities markets have
been shaken by less.
   Uncertainty is the enemy of economic progress. It is a malady
made worse in modern times by computers that spit out positive data
one day, negative the next. It is the all-purpose explanation for
lethargy in securities markets.
   These days, it reigns over all.
   It rises just before budget deficit or trade figures are
released and it is exacerbated every time a statement is released
about the progress of trade talks with Japan. Will the Japanese
live up to their agreements?
   The celebration over political-economic events in Europe is
muted by the uncertainty of what might follow. It rises every time
another blue chip company reports a decline in earnings, as many of
them have been doing lately.
   Uncertainty received a megashot in recent days when President
Bush indicated he might renege on what had been a near-certainty _
that the phrase ``tax increase'' would not escape his lips. Will
he? Or won't he?
   And will Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,
allow interest rates to fall, as so many Wall Street analysts have
been forecasting? Or, perish the thought, might he allow them to
rise, as some analysts fear?
   There's that savings and loan fiasco to deal with. It might be
the ultimate statistical uncertainty; what had been thought to be a
$50 billion disaster, then a $500 billion catastrophe might become
a trillion-dollar tragedy.
   Hearing this, an unnerved financial analyst was thought to say
something to the effect that you haven't heard anything yet. Some
banks and insurers, he said, are in bad shape. They might survive,
he said, but you can't be certain.
   All these concerns must be viewed in the context of the
all-encompassing macro uncertainty, which is whether the economy
will fall into recession or instead grow slightly or perhaps even
embark on a boom.
   Who really knows?
   What is known is that you can never be certain that interest
rates and prices will fall in a recession, no matter what economic
theory states.
   And, you are warned almost every day, if the economy expands
instead, then higher prices and higher interest rates are a real
threat.
   If weather reports were issued this way everyone would run for
cover. But most people hear the bad news forecasts of storms to
come and simply take an umbrella with them. Some just smile, and
sometimes the weather smiles back.
   It is different with economic forecasts. You must think
``dismal.'' There's a statistical threat a day, and even the
brightest indicators carry caveat asterisks, as if every
fair-weather cumulus was a developing tornado.
   Well, said an analyst, you can't be 100 percent certain it
isn't.

   Louisiana's abortion bill isn't the only
piece of restrictive legislation facing Gov. Buddy Roemer, who also
must decide whether to sign a bill to require warning labels on
records.
   Roemer said today that he favors warning labels for recordings
with themes of rape, murder, suicide, incest, illegal drug use,
child abuse and satanic worship, but would prefer that the industry
adopt a voluntary program.
   The Legislature passed legislation Saturday requiring warning
labels on recordings with those themes, and banning sales to minors.
   At a news conference, Roemer said he had serious legal questions
about the constitutionality of the labeling bill. But he said he
did not know yet whether he would sign or veto the measure.
   Roemer said most of the recording industry was acting
responsibly, but ``some portions of the industry produce pure
trash. Parents don't know that until they are brought home and
played,'' he said.
   Roemer said he preferred a voluntary program, similar to he
ratings system adopted by the movie industry. ``We'll all be better
off,'' he said.
   In May, the recording industry unveiled a voluntary labeling
system that it hoped would halt campaigns in some states for
mandatory labeling. The program became effective this month and
labeled recordings already are showing up in stores, said Mike
Cutshaw, an attorney representing the National Association of
Recording Merchandisers.
   The House voted 79-9 to concur with Senate amendments to the
bill by Rep. Ted Haik, and sent it to Roemer for his signature or
veto.
   Although the bill passed both chambers with more than the
two-thirds vote needed to override a veto, the regular session ends
tonight and Roemer has 20 days to decide on the bill after it
reaches his desk. If he vetoes the bill, that would effectively
kill it unless there were a special session called.
   Karen Knowles, the head of the Louisiana Music Commission, which
promotes the state's music industry, said the panel was concerned
because of the potential economic effect the bill could have.
Knowles said she had discussed the bill with the governor, but he
did not say whether he would sign it.
   Thomas Casey, Roemer's executive counsel, said Sunday that the
bill would be studied carefully before the governor makes a
decision.
   Already, the producers of the Grammy Awards show have said such
a law would scuttle Louisiana's chances of being host of the event.
Also, backers of a proposed Grammy Hall of Fame in New Orleans say
the law would end their project, at a cost to the city's depressed
economy estimated by some at $100 million.
   Under the legislation, record manufacturers would be required to
label recordings with objectionable lyrics. Retailers would be
subject to misdemeanor criminal penalties for selling labeled
recordings to those under 17.
   Jay Berman, president of the Recording Industry Association of
America, said most state legislatures considering such bills had
backed down since the industry announced its plans for voluntary
labeling.
   Last week, Capitol Records promised to provide legal help to
store operators threatened with arrest for selling its recordings
that bear labels warning consumers of sexually explicit lyrics.
   Haik said he pushed the bill to force the recording industry to
follow through on long-standing promises to institute a voluntary
labeling system.
   ``This is designed to make the industry put its money where its
mouth is,'' said Sen. Mike Foster, a supporter of the labeling bill.
   The legislation would not take effect until 1992. Haik has said
that if the recording industry implements its voluntary program, he
would push for repeal of the law.
   Cutshaw said a labeling law would not keep objectionable
recordings out of the hands of youths, since older siblings and
friends could make the purchases for them. Instead, the law would
be a ``nightmare'' for retailers, he said.

<TEXT>
   The average business executive spends
about 60 hours a year on hold on the telephone, according to a
survey.
   The survey commissioned by the personnel agency Accountemps
asked questions of 200 executives of the nation's 1,000 largest
corporations. They were questioned by an independent market
research firm, which asked how much time the executives spend on
hold, as well as on unnecessary meetings and unnecessary memos.
   According to the results, the average executive spends 15
minutes a day on hold, or 60 hours in a year that includes four
weeks' vacation; 32 minutes a day reading and writing unnecessary
memos, or 128 hours a year; and an hour and 12 minutes a day at
unnecessary meetings, or 288 hours a year.
   The executives were not asked how much time other people spend
on hold waiting for them.

   Under a bright, sunny sky, 29
solar-powered cars designed and built by college students today
began a 1,600-mile race from Florida to Detroit, Mich., in efforts
to prove a future technology.
   The start of the 11-day race sponsored by the Department of
Energy, the Society of Automative Engineers and General Motors was
led by the first three qualifiers _ from the univerities of
Maryland, Michigan and Mankato State in Minnesota.
   ``We hope young people will get excited about this race'' and
that it serves as an incentive for future technology, said GM
President Bob Stemple in ceremonies before the start.
   Thirty-two cars entered the competition, but Arizona State had
problems with its brakes and gears and was scratched from the first
day's start, organizers said. That car will start up on the second
leg of the race and be penalized for the lost time.
   Winners will be determined by adding up the times it takes to
complete each day's leg of the race.
   Two other cars had trouble getting away immediately but were
expected to leave later in the day. They were the entries from the
Unversity of North Texas and Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in
Indiana.
   The cars, powered only by the sun and storage batteries, will
travel over secondary roads in Florida, Georgia, Alabama,
Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio and Michigan.
   They are headed for a July 19 finish at the General Motors
technical center in Warren, Mich., a suburb outside the motor city.
   The combination of direct sunlight and stored energy can propel
some of the vehicles at high speeds for limited distances, but the
cars must abide by posted speed limits.
   Nevertheless, the students want to win. The top two finishers
and a third selected for technological innovations will be sent by
GM to compete in the 1990 World Solar Challenge race in Australia
later this year.
   ``Each car was conceived, designed and built from the ground
up'' by some of North America's top engineering and science
students, said GM vice president Donald L. Runkle.
   Some of the cars cost more than $250,000 and took more than a
year to build.
   Entries come from schools including MIT, Stanford, the
University of Michigan, Florida Institute of Technology, Viginia
Polytechnic Institute, the University of Pennsylvania,
Waterloo-Ontario and Puerto Rico-Mayaguez.
   GM selected the 32 entries in April 1989 after considered more
than 100 schools and 60 detailed design proposals.
   Sunlight is the only power source, but battery charging from the
car's solar array is allowed daily in the morning and late
afternoon.
   Each of the 32 schools received $5,000 from General Motors and
$2,000 from the U.S. Department of Energy as seed money, but each
each car cost thousands more to build.

<HEAD>Maritime Agency Reaches Settlement with Ocean Freight Lines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Maritime Commission said Monday it
has reached a settlement with several shipping lines operating in
the Pacific that allegedly charged less for cargo than their
published rates.
   The agency said it would not disclose the names of the companies
or the amount of money they will pay until Aug. 28. But a statement
released by the commission said the companies will make the largest
monetary payment to the maritime commission in its 29-year history.
   ``We realized from the beginning that only a strong deterrent
would prevent unlawful practices'' in Pacific trade, acting
commission Chairman James J. Carey said in the statement. ``This
agreement goes a long way toward assuring future compliance with
the Shipping Act of 1984.''
   The largest previous settlement with the commission was $4
million, made in the late 1970s, said Seymour Glanzer, director of
the agency's Bureau of Hearing Counsel. Glanzer declined in a
telephone interview to reveal the identity of the companies, how
many are involved, whether they are U.S. or foreign lines and the
amount of money in the settlement.
   Violations of the Shipping Act or commission regulations can
result in penalties of up to $25,000 per shipment.
   A source familiar with the agreement said it involved between
four and 10 companies.
   The companies allegedly charged rates to ship cargo that were
less than the official tariffs they had previously filed with the
commission, Glanzer said.
   In addition to paying the penalties, the settlement requires
them to fully disclose alleged wrongful or questionable rate
practices, including rebates and inaccurate descriptions of cargo.
   The companies also have agreed to participate in a new
compliance accord that involves stronger policing of cargo rates by
the shipping industry.
   A similar settlement covering cargo trade in the Atlantic, for
$2 million, took effect in 1987.

   Stock prices ended modestly lower on London's
Stock Exchange Monday amid limited buying interest.
   A string of company profit downgradings by equity analysts added
to the growing wariness in the market about British corporate
profitability.
   Some investors were waiting for Britain's June inflation figures
to be released Friday, traders said.
   The strong pound was encouraging for some segments of the
market, particularly those stocks with predominantly British
earnings, dealers said. But the same equities also were being hit
by high interest rates, dealers said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 2.5
points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 2,337.5.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was quoted at 1,859.3, down
5.7 points at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index fell
2.46 points to close at 1,262.84.
   Volume was light at 369.8 million shares, compared with 741.3

   The stock market was mixed in a drifting session
today, bogging down after Friday's rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 25.74 points on
Friday, rose 0.50 to 2,905.45 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers held a slight edge on gainers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 651 up, 666 down and
559 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders found little inspiration in the news to
prompt them to make big commitments either way.
   Interest rates have been moving up since late last week as hopes
have faded for any action soon by the Federal Reserve to relax its
credit policy.
   Economists generally believe that business activity, while
showing anemic growth at best, is not weak enough to spur the
central bank into any stimulative measures.
   At the same time, traders seem to be bracing for a good many
disappointments in forthcoming corporate earnings reports for the
second quarter of the year.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric rose &rsqb; to 71;
International Business Machines added | to 118|; Exxon dropped | to

   Nike class B shares, traded in the over-the-counter market,

   The company that makes OFF! insect
repellent is taking a swat at a small St. Augustine company that
also manufactures a bug repellant.
   Johnson Wax, which introduced OFF! in 1956, alleges trademark
infringement in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in
Jacksonville. The suit also alleges SKEETER OFF, an herbal lotion
mixed with citronella, is taking a bite out of its profits.
   Wayne Ellison, president of EcoSafe, which makes SKEETER OFF,
said his product is available only in health food stores and has
sold only 3,000 bottles since the product was introduced last fall.
   ``They're just too big and powerful. We would be like a flea on
the back on an elephant,'' Ellison said of the suit, filed last
week.
   Daniel Frohling, an attorney representing Johnson, refused to
discuss the lawsuit, which asks the court to order EcoSafe to stop
making SKEETER OFF, transfer all profits from the product and pay
damages and attorney fees.
   Johnson Wax, also known as S.C. Johnson &amp; Son Inc., is based in
Racine, Wis., and employs more than 12,500 workers worldwide. It
also makes Raid roach killer, Pledge furniture polish and Future
floor wax.
   Ellison and two employees run EcoSafe. All but two of its
products are pet-oriented; the company has sales of less than
$500,000.
   SKEETER OFF was originally marketed as SKEETER SHOOO, but the
name was changed because customers became confused with one of his
pet products, INSECT SHOOO, Ellison said.
   Ellison said he will probably quit marketing SKEETER OFF and
return to SKEETER SHOOO, although it means a loss of $5,000 in
packaging materials.

<HEAD>Nike Claims to Pass Adidas to Become World's Largest Sports Shoe
Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nike Inc. vaulted ahead of all worldwide
competitors last year, the company said Monday in reporting an 84
percent leap in its fourth-quarter profit.
   Chairman Philip H. Knight said at a meeting with securities
analysts in New York that Nike intends to enhance its position by
working to boost its already strong business outside the United
States.
   He announced that the company earned $67.2 million, or $1.77 a
share, in the three months ended May 31, up from $36.5 million, or
97 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 47 percent to $609
million from $413.4 million.
   Profit for Nike's entire 1990 fiscal year rose 45 percent to
$242.96 million, or $6.42 a share, from $167.05 million, or $4.45 a
share, in 1989. Annual revenue rose 31 percent to $2.24 billion
from 1989's $1.71 billion.
   ``In 1990, Nike became the largest sports and fitness footwear
and apparel company in the world,'' Knight said. ``We have
accomplished this by marketing a wide range of quality in a variety
of sport categories built on a foundation of truly innovative
performance technology.''
   Nike nosed out Adidas AG, the West German manufacturer, for the
top spot among athletic shoemakers. The company based its claim to
the No. 1 ranking on global sales of the Nike brand and said it
also was the leader in terms of profitability.
   In the United States alone, Nike estimates that it holds about
28 percent of the market. Its closest competitors, Reebok
International Inc. and L.A. Gear Inc., hold 22 percent and 12
percent of the U.S. market, respectively.
   Sales of Nike brand goods worldwide last year surpassed Adidas'
sales, excluding sales of non-Adidas brand merchandise owned by the
Adidas group and revenue from licensed merchandise. As a
privately-held company Adidas doesn't regularly report its results.
It has previously been reported that Adidas had revenue last year
of about $2.8 billion, including licensing revenue.
   Thomas Clarke, Nike's vice president of marketing, said the
practice of including revenue from licensed merchandise
artificially inflates the total. He said Nike calculates that
actual sales of the Adidas brand alone were about $1.6 billion last
year vs. about $2.1 billion for Nike.
   Adidas has been losing market share for years and reportedly
lost about $90 million last year. It was announced over the weekend
that French entrepreneur Bernard Tapie will buy an 80 percent stake
in Adidas. Tapie promised to return Adidas to profitability by next
year.
   The change in Adidas' ownership will not upset Nike's strategy
to dominate the world sports shoe business, said Richard K.
Donahue, Nike president and chief operating officer.
   ``We see them as not being in our league,'' Donahue said,
describing Adidas as a has-been, troubled company.
   Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore., plans to become more aggressive
in promoting its products overseas. It will inaugurate its first
globally coordinated advertising campaign with the launch next
spring of the Air 180, a new model of running shoe incorporating
the latest developments in Nike's air-sole cushioning.
   Clarke said Nike will spend about $20 million on the global
launch of the shoe that will sell for about $130.
   At the securities analysts meeting, Nike also provided a preview
of new television commercials.
   Besides its product-oriented commercials, it showed a public
service-type message encouraging youngsters to stay in school,
starring basketball David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs, his
mother and Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson.

<HEAD>Apple Introduces New Laser Printers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. improved its line
of printers Monday by introducing two new models it hopes will
maintain these machines as a moneymaker.
   The Cupertino-based personal computer company introduced the
laser printers partly in response to stiff competition on several
fronts.
   At $1,999, Apple's new Personal LaserWriter SC cuts the cost of
an entry-level Apple printer by $800. It is aimed at individual
users who might be tempted to buy one of the several lower-priced
printers sold by Apple competitors.
   But analysts say the other new model, the $3,299 Personal
LaserWriter NT, is more important because it is designed to be
shared by a network of computers.
   In addition, unlike the model SC, the NT comes with PostScript,
a brand of software from Adobe Systems Inc. that provides Apple's
Macintosh computers with one of their most important features, the
ability to print elegantly a variety of typefaces and graphics.
   Analysts say sales of laser printers last year accounted for
more than 15 percent of Apple's $5.3 billion in revenues. That
showing could be seriously threatened in the future by
Hewlett-Packard Co., the market leader in laser printers. H-P
recently started making printers that work with Apple's Macintosh
computers.
   In addition, several small printer companies have been
challenging Apple for sales to Macintosh users.
   Apple introduced its first laser printer shortly after it
announced the Macintosh in 1984. The combination of these two
products and special software resulted in a new computer
application called desktop publishing, a way of computerizing the
layout process of printing.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn ended mixed
to higher after some private forecasters predicted hotter, drier
weather for the Corn Belt.
   But most meteorologists continued to forecast a week of mild
temperatures and scattered showers in the Midwest, ideal weather
for corn and soybean development.
   Wheat futures remained under pressure from the winter wheat
harvest, which is nearing completion.
   ``We've got increasing supplies in a time of very poor foreign
demand, and that leaves prices with nowhere to go but lower,'' said
Joel Karlin, a grains analyst with Research Department Inc. in
Chicago.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1} cents to 4{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in July at $3.07 a bushel; corn was \

   Britain on Monday denied it was about to link the
pound to the exchange rate mechanism covering other major European
currencies.
   Sterling strengthened in foreign exchange on speculation that
such an announcement would be made at the Houston summit. In late
New York trading, the pound was quoted at $1.8065, up from late
Friday's $1.7865.
   ``I can assure you that I am not going to announce this morning
that Britain is about to join the exchange rate mechanism,'' John
Major, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, told a news
conference.
   Major, speaking shortly before the opening of the summit of the
world's seven top industrialized nations, reiterated that Britain's
conditions for joining the exchange rate mechanism were unchanged.
   Britain promised in principle last summer to join the mechanism
when its inflation rate _ now nearly 10 percent and among the
highest in the European Community _ falls. Other conditions about
free capital movements in the community largely have been met.
   The exchange rate mechanism links nine of the 12 currencies of
the European Community. It is designed to prevent wide fluctuations
in exchange rates.
   Earlier, Major met Jacques Delors, president of the community's
executive commission, to press Britain's alternative plan to
Delors' radical proposals for a single European Community currency.
   ``President Delors made it clear the commission is seriously
examining our proposals,'' said Major.
   The British proposal is for a new, hard European currency, the
European Currency Unit or ECU, to circulate alongside the
community's present currencies. At present the ECU is used
primarily as an accounting mechanism.
   Britain announced the plan last month. A special conference is
due to open in December and is supposed to make final decisions by
the end of 1992, the year internal EC trade barriers are to be
dismantled.
   The Delors program calls for a single central banking system as
well as one currency. Britain says it never will agree to the
Delors plan because it means surrendering national control over its
economy.

   A Japanese developer again topped a list of the
world's richest people, but the annual tally has one conspicuous
deletion this year: Donald J. Trump.
   Despite the financial troubles of the New York developer, the
United States continues to contain the world's largest number of
billionaires _ 62 _ according to estimates by Forbes magazine. In
addition, there are 37 U.S. families with fortunes over $1 billion,
Forbes says in its July 23 issue.
   Forbes, in estimates released Monday, says the world's
wealthiest person for the fourth straight year was Yoshiaki
Tsutsumi of Japan, whose railroad and real estate empire includes
golf courses, ski resorts and hotels. Forbes estimated his net
worth at $16 billion, up about $1 billion from last year.
   That estimate was far greater than that of rival business
magazine Fortune, which put Tsutsumi's net worth at $3.1 billion
last September.
   Fortune said the world's richest person is the Sultan of Brunei,
at $25 billion. Forbes excludes heads of state from consideration.
   Following the 56-year-old Tsutsumi on the Forbes list was
Japanese developer Taikichiro Mori, a former economics professor
who now owns 78 office buildings. Forbes put Mori's net worth at
$14.6 billion.
   Ranked third was the family of Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart,
the third-largest U.S.retail chain. Forbes estimates that the
Waltons, who also were third-ranked last year, are worth $13.3
billion, up from $8.7 billion in 1989.
   America's du Pont family was fourth, with a net worth estimated
at $10 billion. They were followed by Hans and Gad Rausing, two
Swedish brothers who control a packaging empire worth $9.6 billion.
   Kitaro Watanabe, a Japanese real estate owner, was sixth at $9.2
billion. He was followed by Canada's Reichmann brothers, owners of
the Olympia &amp; York real estate company, at $9 billion.
   Kenkichi Nakajima and his family, founder of Japan's largest
maker of pachinko machines, a gambling game similar to pinball,
were eighth at $8.4 billion.
   South Korea's Shin Kyuk-ho, who owns a candy and real estate
empire, was ninth at $7 billion to $8 billion; and Forrest E. Mars
and family of the United States, of Mars candy fame, were 10th at
an estimated $6 billion.
   Other American families with net worth exceeding $3 billion
included the Newhouse, Hearst and Cox families, which derive their
fortunes from publishing and broadcasting; the Bass family of
Texas; the Mellon family of banking fame; the Dorrance family,
whose wealth comes from Campbell Soup Co.; and Bill Gates, founder
of the computer software company Microsoft Corp.
   John Werner Kluge remained the richest American individual,
according to Forbes. Kluge, founder of the media company
Metromedia, has an estimated net worth of $5.2 billion, placing him
in a tie for 12th place on the worldwide list with the Newhouses.
   As for Trump, Forbes put his net worth last year at $1.7
billion, but it dropped sharply this year as the value of his real
estate and airline empire plummeted. In April, the magazine said he
was worth about a half a billion dollars. Some sources peg it even
lower.
   Forbes says one trend it noticed in compiling this year's list
was the number of wealthy Germans. The magazine identified 38 West
German billionaire families _ far more per capita than in Japan or
the United States.
   The list includes 40 Japanese and 99 American individuals or
families with a net worth over $1 billion.
   Forbes says it identified 271 billionaire individuals or
families worldwide, up from 226 last year. The compilation is based
on recent stock valuations, comparable real estate valuations and
currency exchange rates, among other factors.
   The magazine says it excludes from consideration royal families
and heads of state because their wealth ``derives more from
political heritage than from economic effort.''
   But it doesn't exclude drug dealers. Among the billionaires it
lists are Colombia's Pablo Escobar Gaviria, the head of the
Medellin cocaine cartel, at about $3 billion, and Colombia's Ochoa
family, at about $2 billion.

<HEAD>Three Computer Hackers Plead Guilty to BellSouth Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three members of an underground group of computer
hackers that bilked telecommunications companies of money and
credit information pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges
Monday.
   The three are members of the ``Legion of Doom,'' a closely knit
group of about 15 computer hackers operating in Georgia, Texas,
Michigan, Illinois, Florida, New York and other states, said U.S.
Attorney Joe Whitley.
   Whitley said the group disrupted telecommunications, stole
computer source codes and information, stole credit information and
fraudulently obtained money and property.
   In May, authorities in Indiana who prosecuted a teen-ager
involved with the group called it an elite group of hackers that
accepted only the nation's best computer moles.
   The juvenile, who was not identified, pleaded guilty to 11
counts of fraud and agreed to testify against the Atlanta men in a
trial scheduled to begin Monday.
   Instead, the three pleaded guilty. They were identified as Adam
E. Grant, 22, and Robert J. Riggs, 22, both of Atlanta, and
Franklin E. Darden Jr., 24, of Norcross.
   Federal authorities charged that between Sept. 10, 1987, and
July 21, 1989, the three men illegally accessed various BellSouth
Co. computer systems and obtained valuable information that they
distributed to other hackers.
   Grant and Darden also monitored private telephone conversations,
Whitley said in a statement.
   They were charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud, wire
fraud, access code fraud and interstate transportation of stolen
property.
   Darden and Riggs pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy each
and face a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000
fine.
   Grant pleaded guilty to possessing 15 or more BellSouth access
devices with intent to defraud and faces a possible 10 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.
   A spokesman for BellSouth, Scott Ticer, said the operation cost
his company about $1.5 million, most of it for investigating and
changing access codes.

<HEAD>Rates Increase at Treasury Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Monday's auction to their highest level in
several weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $9.0 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.81 percent, up from 7.73 percent
last week. Another $9.0 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.75 percent, up from 7.60 percent last
week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 7.91
percent on April 30, and six-month bills averaged 7.79 percent on
May 21.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.08 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,802.60, and 8.18 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,608.20.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 8.06
percent last week, down from 8.13 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Prestigious French Department Store Comes to Tower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAYNER PIKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump announced Monday that Galeries
Lafayette, the giant French retailer, will open a branch store in
Trump Tower, helping to solidify the value of his 68-story
skyscraper on Fifth Avenue.
   ``We have a fabulous anchor for Trump Tower, it's a fabulous
tenant,'' Trump said at a news conference with Galeries Lafayette's
chairman, Georges Meyer.
   Neither Trump nor Meyer disclosed terms of the lease. Published
reports said it would be for 25 years and estimated it would be
worth tens of millions of dollars to Trump by enhancing the tower's
attractiveness as security for loans.
   Meyer said the new branch would open in the fall of 1991. It
will occupy 80,000 square feet fronting on 57th Street in a
six-floor section of the tower vacated by Bonwit Teller's flagship
store.
   Trump had made no bones about wanting to be rid of Bonwit, the
previous prime tenant that he characterized as a poorly run
has-been and unfit to be a neighbor of the other shops in Trump
Tower.
   He paid about $5 million to acquire its lease earlier this year
after Bonwit's owner went into reorganization proceedings.
   A deal with Galeries Lafayette was made several weeks ago and
the papers were signed Sunday night, Trump said.
   ``We took a little bit of a risk when we bought out the lease,''
Trump said. ``It was my intention to get this group into this
building and it worked out,'' he said.
   Asked how his bondholders and investors might feel about it,
Trump said, ``I think they're very, very happy.''
   The main Galeries Lafayette store in Paris occupies 500,000
square feet, six times the space of the New York branch. After
Harrods of London, it is Europe's biggest department store.
   Meyer said the company has done more than $4 billion a year in
business at its 136 stores. Twenty of the stores bear the Galeries
Lafayette name and the rest are operated by subsidiaries, he said.
   Meyer said he was not ready yet to estimate how much business
the new branch might do.

   Energy futures rose Monday led by a surge in
wholesale gasoline prices.
   The session started with brisk selling on the New York
Mercantile Exchange amid speculation that supply will exceed demand
for the near future. The end of an oil workers' strike in Norway
provided another selling incentive.
   But an afternoon rally, motivated in part by technical forces,
helped energy prices rebound.
   Wholesale gasoline prices continued to firm in the aftermath of
Friday's explosion and fire at an Arco Chemical Co. plant in Texas.
Traders bought on the assumption that temporary shortages in a gas
additive produced by the plant could disrupt availability of
premium gas grades in some areas.
   Unleaded gasoline for August delivery jumped 1.44 cents to 56.85
cents a gallon after adding 0.46 cent on Friday. Contracts for
delivery during September through November also posted gains.
   The contract for August delivery of the benchmark U.S. crude
oil, West Texas Intermediate, advanced 11 cents to $16.58 cents a
42-gallon barrel following Friday's decline of 3 cents. The
contracts for delivery through November also settled higher.
   Among other refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale
home heating oil for August delivery settled at 48.90 cents a
gallon, up 0.60 cent. The contract lost 0.03 cent on Friday. The
September through November contracts finished higher.
   In natural gas trading, the August contract fell to $1.493 per
1,000 cubic feet from $1.498 on Friday.
   Analyst James Steel at Refco Inc. said crude garnered technical
support from the ability of the August contract to remain above $16
a barrel despite heavy selling in the morning.
   Fresh indications that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is making a concerted effort to cope with a world oil
price slump ahead of a general meeting July 25 also encouraged
buying, he said.

<HEAD>Leather Goods Maker Charges Retailer With Copying Handbags</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coach Leatherware Co. on Monday said it has
charged specialty retailer Ann Taylor Inc. with deliberately
copying some of Coach's most popular handbags.
   A lawsuit seeking damages has been filed by Coach, a subsidiary
of Sara Lee Corp., against Ann Taylor and its manufacturer, Laura
Leather Goods Ltd., Coach said in a news release.
   Coach President Lew Frankfort said, ``It is clear from looking
at these Ann Taylor products that the intention was to make
customers believe they were Coach.''
   The Ann Taylor handbags are more than just imitations, ``they
are direct knock-offs,'' he said.
   Joseph Schumm, Ann Taylor's executive vice president and general
counsel, who normally would comment on legal matters, was not in
the New York headquarters Monday and was unable to be reached, a
secretary in his office said.
   Jan Still-Lindeman, a spokeswoman for Coach, said the Ann Taylor
bags alleged to closely resemble Coach styles bear small leather
tags, attached with a chain, that are almost identical to ones on
Coach bags.
   She said Coach has estimated the damages at over $500,000.
   The lawsuit is pending in U.S. District Court in New York.

   The stock market crept ahead in a quiet,
drifting session Monday, extending the upswing it began late last
week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.16 to 2,914.11 on
top of Friday's 25.74-point gain.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 8 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
764 up, 673 down and 545 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders found little inspiration in the news to
prompt them to make big commitments either way.
   Interest rates have been moving up since late last week as hopes
have faded for any action soon by the Federal Reserve to relax its
credit policy.
   In Monday's activity prices of long-term government bonds
dropped nearly $5 for each $1,000 in face value, increasing their
yields to the 8.54 percent-8.58 percent range.
   Economists generally believe that business activity, while
showing anemic growth at best, is not weak enough to spur the Fed
into any stimulative measures.
   At the same time, traders seem to be bracing for a good many
disappointments in forthcoming corporate earnings reports for the
second quarter of the year.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric rose } to
71&rsqb;; International Business Machines added 1 to 119; Eli Lilly
dropped { to 86, and Philip Morris was down &rsqb; at 48~.
   Nike class B stock, traded in the over-the-counter market,
climbed 7\ to 87\. The company reported earnings for the fiscal
quarter ended May 31 of $1.77 a share, up from 97 cents in the
comparable period a year earlier.
   Wal-Mart Stores rose 1\ to 32} on turnover of some 2.68 million
shares, aided by expectations on a bright June sales report from
the company later this week.
   Elsewhere in the retailing group, Melville Corp. gained { to
53{; J.C. Penney 1 to 60}; Sears Roebuck &lsqb; to 36\; Woolworth \ to
34|, and K mart \ to 35\.
   Luby's Cafeterias rose &lsqb; to 29, trading at three-year highs. The
company declared a 3-for-2 stock split and a dividend increase.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 119.39 million
shares, barely outpacing Friday's 1990 low of 111.73 million.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 146.49 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $8.01 billion, or 0.23
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .45 to 196.23.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.78 to 424.10, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.10 at 359.52.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
advanced 1.15 to 461.68. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 358.65, down .22.

   A French investor accused of insider trading
on Rorer Group Inc. securities has settled the charges with federal
officials, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced Monday.
   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Robert Rossi agreed to
pay nearly $1.45 million in alleged illegal profits plus interest.
   The settlement was approved by a federal judge in New York on
July 3.
   Rossi, who maintains a mailing address in Geneva, Switzerland,
was accused with three foreign companies last January of trading on
inside information about merger talks between Rorer, a Fort
Washington, Penn., pharmaceutical company, and another company
later identified as France's Rhone-Poulenc SA.
   Daniel A. Pollack, an attorney for Rossi in New York, said his
client was pleased with the settlement and ``takes the position
that his investment decision was based on his own analyses of Rorer
and other drug stocks. The fact that the commission did not
penalize him, but only required him to disgorge his profits is some
indication that the SEC would have a difficult time proving the
charges agasinst him in a courtroom.''
   Pollack said Rossi was a French citizen living in Africa, but
declined to say where, adding ``for Rossi to have litigated in New
York City'' would have been ``expensive, burdensome and time
consuming.''
   In January, Rorer Group said it had agreed in principle to
pursue the sale of a 68 percent stake to Rhone-Poulenc for about
$73 per share.
   The SEC has not disclosed how the defendants allegedly obtained
the inside information.
   Rossi's settlement was the first in the case, said Gary Sundick,
an attorney with the SEC in Washington. He said charges have been
dismissed against Foundation Hai of Monte Carlo, Monaco.

<HEAD>Cotton Futures Take Tumble After Long Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cotton futures prices fell sharply Monday on the New York Cotton
Exchange, extending a slide that began last week and represents the
market's steepest drop this year.
   On other commodity markets, energy futures rallied; sugar
plummeted; precious metals were lower; grains and soybeans were
mixed; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Cotton futures fell 0.8 cent to the permitted daily limit of 2
cents with the contract for delivery in October off 2 cents at
76.74 cents a pound. The July contract expired at 90 cents a pound.
   The retreat followed limit losses in most contracts on Friday.
Analysts attributed the selloff to profit-taking after a six-month
rally that boosted the price of cotton for near-term delivery from
about 66 cents in early January to a high of 93.9 cents a pound on
July 5.
   ``This has been a bull market like we haven't seen in years and
years,'' said Ernest Simon, a cotton specialist with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   He said prices had been driven steadily higher over the past six
months by strong domestic and international demand for U.S. cotton
and, more recently, by poor growing weather in the high plains of
Texas, where ``it has been much too dry and much too hot for weeks
on end.''
   A surge in wholesale gasoline prices led energy futures higher
on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Analyst Stephen W. Platt of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said
gasoline prices continued to firm in the aftermath of Friday's
explosion and fire at an Arco Chemical Co. plant in Texas.
   Traders bought on the assumption that temporary shortages of a
gas additive produced by the plant could disrupt availability of
premium gas grades in some areas, Platt said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 27 cents
lower with August at $16.58 a barrel; heating oil was .53 cent to
.63 cent higher with August at 48.90 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .20 cent to 1.44 cents higher with August at 56.85
cents a gallon.
   Sugar futures plummeted on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange after the European Commission released a European sugar
beet crop forecast of 14.18 million metric tons, up 106,000 from a
year earlier.
   Further support stemmed from the Brazilian government's decision
to authorize refiners in Brazil to produce more sugar and less
alcohol from sugar cane, said analyst Arthur Stevenson of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Stevenson said trading volume was ``huge'' and dominated by
speculative fund selling.
   Sugar settled .50 cent to .74 cent lower with October at 11.9
cents a pound.
   In precious metals trading on New York's Commodity Exchange,
gold futures settled $2.90 to $3 lower with August at $359.90 a
troy ounce; silver was 6.6 cents to 6.9 cents lower with July at
$4.80 a troy ounce.
   Wheat and soybean futures ended lower on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Corn advanced after some private forecasters predicted drier
weather for the Corn Belt later this week.
   After the close, the National Weather Service issued a new
six-to-10-day forecast for mild temperatures and drier-than-normal
conditions in the Midwest during the first half of next week.
   But most meteorologists continued to forecast scattered showers
in the region this week, which would be beneficial to the corn and
soybean crops.
   Wheat futures remained under pressure from the winter wheat
harvest, which was 71 percent complete as of Sunday, according to
the Agriculture Department's weekly crop-conditions report.
   The report showed slight improvement in the corn crop but no
improvement in the soybean crop.
   Wheat futures settled 1{ cents to 5 cents lower with July at
$3.06{ a bushel; corn was \ cent to 6} cents higher with July at
$2.80} a bushel; oats were 2} cents to 3{ cents lower with July at
$1.27{ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 4 cents lower with July at
$6.16{ a bushel.
   Hog futures extended Friday's steep losses on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, reflecting recent high hog slaughter numbers
and slack demand for bacon. Cattle futures rose in line with
stronger cash markets.
   Live cattle settled .25 cent to .50 cent higher with August at
74.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .27 cent to .70 cent higher
with August at 85.27 cents a pound; live hogs were .47 cent to 1.08
cents lower with July at 60.97 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 2 cents lower to .10 cent higher with July at 52.17 cents a
pound.

<HEAD>Digital Announces New Computer Line</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp., which is suffering from
sluggish earnings, announced a new midrange computer line Monday
designed to provide desktop computer users with more flexibility.
   The computer line, called VAX 4000, is designed to compete
directly with computers offered by International Business Machines
Corp. Digital unveiled the products at its annual DECWorld sales
exposition here.
   The new line is based on client-server computing, which allows
one or more computers to act as control centers for networks of
desktop machines.
   ``In the '90s, people want to use computers in a much more
effective way,'' said Kenneth Olsen, Digital's president.
   Digital says the VAX 4000 delivers more power than IBM's popular
AS-400 minicomputer at half the cost. Digital is the world's
second-largest computer company behind IBM.
   ``Users want to sit at the desktop of their choice,'' Olsen
said. ``They want the flexibility to quickly access information in
any database on the network, use the right application to get their
work done, and share the work they do with anyone else who needs
it.''
   Digital estimates there is a potential client-server market of
more than $100 billion over the next five years, as the networked
style of computing spreads from the office to the laboratory to the
factory.
   The VAX 4000 announcement follows a fiscal year in which Digital
reported sluggish earnings. The company, based in the suburb of
Maynard, has offered voluntary severance to thousands of employees
to reduce its work force.
   Digital has not reported its fourth-quarter earnings for the
fiscal year ended June 30. But the company said last month that
external forecasts of its fourth-quarter earnings were too
optimistic.
   In the quarter that ended March 31, Digital earned $24.9
million, or 20 cents a share, compared with $256 million, or $2.05
per share, during the same period a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   Microelectronics and Computer Technology
Corp., a computer industry consortium, said Monday it has named
former Pentagon researcher Craig Fields as its new president.
   Grant Dove, chairman and chief executive officer of the
consortium, said the appointment of Fields would begin ``a smooth
transition to the next generation of leadership for MCC.''
   Dove said Fields would be named to the additional post of CEO
next year ``to allow me to transition to a less than full-time role
as chairman of the board.''
   Fields, who was director of the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, also will serve as chief technical officer and
chief operating officer of the consortium.
   The consortium, owned by 21 high-tech companies, conducts
long-term research on computer technology and microelectronics.
   ``MCC has proven that competitors in industry can collaborate on
high-risk applied research, providing significant competitive
advantages to the participating companies,'' Fields said.
   Dove, who was executive vice president of Texas Instruments
Inc., was elected MCC's chairman in 1987. He said Fields'
experience is exactly what the 8-year-old research group was
looking for.
   ``Many of our original research programs are starting to mature
and bear fruit. Craig will help us to establish and implement our
new vision and priorities for the next seven to 10 years,'' Dove
said.

<TEXT>
   With West Germany and France in the lead, the
prosperous Western democracies are gearing up for a
multi-billion-dollar effort to protect Mikhail Gorbachev from the
economic morass that threatens his hold on Soviet power.
   Long lines and restive consumers give ample evidence that
Gorbachev's economic reforms need an infusion of imagination and
cash.
   Inability to keep food stores stocked has already forced Moscow
to spend an extra 3 billion rubles _ $500 million _ on food
imports. The White House says half the Soviet grain crop goes bad
before it gets to the marketplace.
   Gorbachev has asked the West for financial and technical
assistance and the subject dominated the first day of this week's
economic summit. The summit leaders are split down the middle on
how to proceed, and apparently agreed Monday to allow one another
to go their own way.
   West Germany alone hopes to make $3.1 billion in loans
available. Along with France and Italy, it is pressing for an
overall Western aid package in excess of $15 billion.
   ``If we don't decide now to help the Soviet Union there is a
risk that there will be no progress, no further reform'' of the
Soviet political system, France's Francois Mitterrand said in the
opening summit session. His remark was relayed by spokesman Hubert
Vedrine.
   President Bush and Margaret Thatcher of Britain lead the go-slow
faction. They question the wisdom of pumping in aid without more
Soviet reform and the Americans are emphasizing instead their
willingness to provide technical assistance to improve Soviet
agriculture and transportation.
   Nonetheless, they have delivered Gorbachev a substantial gift by
not trying to block the others. The summit nations are planning to
act in concert in dispatching teams of bankers and other experts to
assess Soviet needs _ perhaps setting the stage for a more
substantial American commitment.
   ``Every country has its own kind of legitimate interests and
concerns,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said. ``We
do not question them.''
   Seventy-three years after the Russian revolution, Soviet
officials emphasized on Monday that assistance could not carry
Western conditions. ``We aren't taking orders,'' said Gorbachev
aide Georgy Shaknazarov.
   But Bush has three main objections to offering direct aid: the
Soviets' heavy military spending, their sending $5 billion a year
in aid to Marxist Cuba and their slow pace in adapting to
capitalistic ways.
   It was vaguely possible that summit leaders might attempt to set
specific conditions concerning one or more of those problems before
approving aid.
   The Soviets are open about their need for Western help. ``I feel
it would be advantageous, for us and the West,'' said Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. He said he disliked the term ``aid,''
preferring ``credit, technical cooperation, personnel training,
joint ventures and joint projects'' _ a message welcome to Bush.
   Only a year ago, the United States, Britain, France, Canada,
West Germany, Japan and Italy stepped gingerly into these uncharted
waters and decided to help Poland and Hungary. The Soviet Union
presents a far more difficult decision.
   From the French delegation, meanwhile, came a statement of
renewed determination to bolster Gorbachev and the Soviet economy
with ``all aid that is serious and useful.''
   Failure of perestroika could mean Gorbachev's downfall and begin
an era of instability across the Soviet Union. Where would the West
be, asked Brian Mulroney of Canada, ``if they chuck him out?''
   U.S. officials make this kind of case for moving slowly:
   _ It is impossible to keep tabs on assistance. Many of the
billions could be diverted to the Red Army where the generals and
Gorbachev do not always see eye to eye.
   _ It doesn't make sense to send billions to the Soviets while
they are sending billions to Cuba, a state whose interests often
collide with the United States'. Mulroney agrees with Bush that
Soviet aid to Cuba is ``profoundly unacceptable,'' and he said
Canada was willing to provide trade credits, not direct assistance.
   _ The Soviet economy is so messed up that immediate aid will be
wasted. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said Monday: ``There's no
sense in pouring money into a system that isn't ready to receive
it.''

   The dollar finished mixed in light domestic
trading Monday as currency traders kept a close watch on the
economic summit in Houston but had little news to act upon.
   Gold prices fell. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold bullion
for current delivery slipped $2.90 from late Friday to settle at
$358.20 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a
late bid for gold at $357.40, off $2.80.
   Currency dealers said trading in the British pound was the most
active feature of the foreign exchange markets Monday.
   Sterling was boosted by continued expectation that Great Britain
soon will join Europe's exchange rate mechanism. The mechanism
limits exchange rate movements, and the markets expect it would
strengthen the currency.
   The pound also was supported by comments from British Chancellor
of the Exchequer John Major that the recent strength of the pound
was no fluke but reflected the currency's true value. Major spoke
at the Houston meeting of the leaders of the seven biggest
industrial nations.
   ``Sterling remains extremely strong across the board,'' said
Robert Hatcher, a corporate currency dealer for Barclays Bank PLC
in New York.
   In London, a pound was quoted at $1.8055, up strongly from late
Friday's $1.7865. The pound had not been above $1.8000 in London
since Jan. 4, 1989. Later, in New York trading, a pound cost
$1.8080, more expensive than $1.7865 late Friday.
   The Japanese yen was boosted in domestic trading by comments
from a U.S. Treasury official that the currency was considered low
in value compared with other currencies, said Lorenzo Troni, vice
president of foreign exchange at PaineWebber International Inc. in
New York.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 150.70 yen, down 0.25 yen from
Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 151.10
yen. In New York, a dollar bought 151.15 yen, down from 151.70 yen
late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's late
rates, included: 1.6528 West German marks, up from 1.6515; 1.3965
Swiss francs, down from 1.3983; 5.5460 French francs, up from
5.5435; 1,211.25 Italian lire, down from 1,211.50; and 1.1586
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1619.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with Friday's late
levels, included: 1.6495 German marks, down from 1.6540; 1.3950
Swiss francs, down from 1.4005; 5.5353 French francs, down from
5.5515; 1,208.50 Italian lire, down from 1,213.25; 1.8573 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.8595; and 1.1590 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1630.
   Gold in London was quoted at a late bid of $358.15 a troy ounce,
down from late Friday's $361.25. In Zurich, gold was quoted at
$357.90 an ounce, down from $361.25 late Friday. Earlier, in Hong
Kong, gold closed at $360.62 an ounce, up 14 cents from Saturday's
close.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London at $4.86 a troy ounce, down
from $4.88 from late Friday.
   Silver prices were marginally lower. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery settled at $4.80 a troy ounce, down
from $4.866 late Friday. In London, silver was $4.86 a troy ounce,
down from $4.88 late Friday.

<TEXT>
   President Bush argued ``very forcefully'' with
his summit partners Monday to phase out billions of dollars in farm
subsidies but there were few signs that European leaders would heed
the arguments.
   Bush has made reaching a compromise on the farm issue a top
priority at this week's seven-nation economic summit, believing
that a resolution is critical to breaking a deadlock in a four-year
effort to overhaul the global trading system.
   But officials of the 12-nation European Community, which
participates in the annual economic summit gatherings, insisted
that Houston was not the place to negotiate on the trade issue,
throwing into doubt whether the administration will be able to
achieve a hoped-for breakthrough.
   The United States has much at stake in the global trade talks
because they offer the promise of greatly expanding markets for
U.S. farmers and businesses. More exports would help reduce
America's $100 billion annual trade deficit.
   The trade talks, known as the Uruguay Round for the country
where they were launched in 1986, have reached a virtual stalemate
over the divisive farm issue.
   Bush brought up the trade negotiations in a string of one-on-one
sessions with world leaders before the summit officially got under
way Monday.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu told reporters that Bush
believed resolution of the trade dispute ``is critical. It should
and must be done.''
   The agricultural question was taken up in the first round of
talks between the leaders on Monday afternoon at Rice University.
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the
administration fears that the entire global free trade talks will
falter without a resolution of the farm issue.
   Bush is ``making the point very forcefully to his summit
partners that this is an enormously important activity,''
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter told reporters.
   Yeutter said that so far ``the European Community has not been
engaged in the process.''
   But the European Community contends that between 2 million and 3
millin European farmers could lose their jobs if the subsidies
which support their less-efficient operations were eliminated.
   The EC, known as the Common Market, is represented at the
economic summit by EC President Jacques Delors, who met with Bush
before the summit began to discuss their differences.
   Bush took a tough stance, telling Delors that the political
leaders needed to exhibit courage to resolve the issue, an EC
official said.
   ``It was quite hard on agriculture,'' said the official, who
spoke on condition that his name not be used.
   Aides said Bush also discussed agricultural policy in his
meeting with French President Francois Mitterrand and West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the two leaders with the strongest
opposition to total elimination of farm subsidies.
   Kohl indicated to Bush that a draft negotiating paper on the
agricultural issue unveiled recently by the chairman of the
negotiating group, Aart de Zeeuw, a former Dutch agricultural
official, could be the basis for breaking the deadlock, Hans Klein,
Kohl's spokesman, told reporters.
   Yeutter said Kohl's stance was ``mildly encouraging.'' But
another U.S. official, who spoke on condition that his name not be
used, said that it was unclear whether Kohl's comments really
signified a new willingness to negotiate.
   Kohl is particularly crucial to resolving the agricultural
question because Bush is unlikely to push too hard for concessions
if the German leader digs in his heels because of upcoming German
unification elections.
   Those elections will occur around the time negotiators are
scheduled to meet in Brussels for the final bargaining session to
complete the Uruguay Round of trade talks. The talks are being
conducted under the auspices of the 97-nation General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
   In the opening session, Kohl spoke about the need to conclude
the global trade talks successfully, telling the other leaders,
``We should give the negotiators ... a positive signal and a
political orientation that we all jointly stand for strengthening
the GATT.''
   Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark said he believed after
discussions with Common Market officials that ``some ground can be
found for forward movement.''
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills told reporters that the
United States hoped to achieve a commitment from the summit
countries to use the de Zeeuw paper as the basis for working out a
final agreement but she said it was not certain whether even this
position would overcome European resistance.
   In addition to phasing out farm subsidies, the United States has
an ambitious goal of expanding global trade rules to include about
$1 trillion in trade not now covered by the GATT, the world body
which policies trade disputes.
   The U.S. proposal would result in the elimination of barriers to
trade in the high-growth area of banking and other services, where
U.S. companies are extremely competitive. American negotiators are
also pushing to extend GATT rules to cover better enforcement of
trade and copyright piracy, which is estimated to cost American
companies $60 billion in lost sales each year.
   In all of these issues, agriculture is seen as the key because
Third World countries have balked at agreeing to U.S. proposals on
expanding GATT coverage unless they win expanded markets for their
farm products.

<HEAD>Mitusbishi To Form Joint Venture With Chicago Arbitrage Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. said Tuesday it
will form a joint venture with Chicago Research &amp; Trading Group
Ltd., one of the United States' leading futures and options traders.
   The joint venture, with $150 million in start-up capital, will
enable Mitsubishi Trust to join major European and U.S. option
trading exchanges, such as those in Chicago and Philadelphia,
Mitsubishi officials said.
   The deal appears to mark a rare case of a Japanese financial
institution taking an active managgement and policy making role in
a joint venture with an American financial institution.
   In addition, Japanese firms in the past have not joined forces
with any U.S. firms that deal strictly with futures and options in
the United States.
   Toshihiro Hayashi of Mitsubishi Trust's bond and money market
division said the joint venture, as yet unnamed, will be formed
later this year. The project is awaiting approval from Japan's
Finance Ministry and the U.S. government.
   He said the joint venture would strengthen the credit standing
of the Chicago-based firm, one of the world's largest arbitrage
trading firms, a member of 20 exchanges worldwide.
   Arbitrage trading refers to buying currency, commercial bills or
securities in one market and selling them at the same time in
another market to reap profits on the price discrepancy.
   The joint venture is to be based in Chicago and have offices in
Tokyo, London, New York and Philadelphia. It will pursue arbitrage
trading primarily in currencies and interest rate-related products
on major exchanges and on over-the-counter markets.

   The timber industry urged the government
Monday to reject a spotted-owl protection strategy proposed by
government scientists, saying it would cost 102,000 jobs and turn
some towns into rural ghettos.
   Researchers commissioned by the American Forest Resource
Alliance said logging communities in Washington, Oregon and
Northern California accept the need to reduce timber harvests to
protect the environment.
   But they said the government should consider human as well as
environmental needs in developing a plan to protect the endangered
owl.
   ``Yeah, we're going to lose jobs,'' said John Beuter, a forest
economics consultant from Portland, Ore. He said the question is,
``How much of this is really necessary and how will it be
implemented over time?''
   The Forest Service has estimated that 28,000 timber jobs would
be lost by the end of the decade under owl-protection policies
recommended in an April report written by team of government
scientists headed by Jack Ward Thomas.
   Beuter said his research shows the figure would be twice that,
plus thousands more jobs lost outside the timber industry. The
direct and indirect job loss would come to 102,000 by the end of
the decade if the report's strategy is applied to public and
private lands, he said.
   A federal timber task force is scheduled to come up with an
extensive owl-protection plan by Sept. 1.
   Estimates of the remaining spotted owl population range from
3,000 to 5,000 pairs. Each nesting pair needs a large tract of
undisturbed old-growth forest, biologists say.
   Robert Lee, a natural resource sociologist at the University of
Washington, said a bitter class war already has developed between
urban environmentalists who want to save old-growth forests and
loggers who are ``portrayed as Neanderthals of the woods.''
   Lee, part of the timber industry's research team, predicted
rural communities would find it difficult to adapt to a changing
economy. ``People are so isolated,'' he said. ``They have
non-transferable skills. They have a sense of identity. ... They
may not be able to sell their homes. They're immobilized.''
   The stress on timber workers could lead to increased suicides,
drug abuse and family violence, Lee said.
   ``The real issue is how to humanize the transition to another
way of life,'' he said, adding that one way would be to let
Northwest communities participate in the decision-making process.
   Last month the Bush administration announced partial plans to
reduce timber harvests on land controlled by the Bureau of Land
Management. The estimated impact of those plans would be about
1,000 logging jobs lost over two years.
   The administration also formed the task force, which is working
on a plan for the millions of acres controlled by the Forest
Service.
   Environmentalists have indicated they will go to court if the
eventual plan is less than the Thomas report strategy.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service last month announced it will
classify the spotted owl as threatened and entitled to protection
under the Endangered Species Act. The act requires federal agencies
to secure permission from the service before harming a species or
its habitat.
   The study team for the American Forest Resource Alliance reports
included private consultants as well as economists, social
scientists and foresters from the universities of Washington,
California, Montana and Minnesota.
