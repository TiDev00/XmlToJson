   ``Quiet on the Set'' is an off-Broadway play
that's fun _ several layers of soap opera froth _ though it's
slightly more fun in the idea than the delivery.
   The play is about the actors on a TV daytime drama and their
off-screen lives, which are as tangled as the plot of their show.
The play opened Wednesday at the Orpheum Theater.
   It's a chance for two couples to overact on purpose, put on the
throaty, overdramatic voice of the soaps and breathe lines like,
``That's a long and sordid story.''
   The five actors and the writer of ``Quiet on the Set'' are soap
opera stars. Trent Bushey plays David Rampal, Kate Collins plays
Natalie Hunter, Cady McClain plays Dixie Cooney and Matt Servitto
plays Trask Bodine on ``All My Children.'' Robert Newman plays
Joshua Lewis and playwright Terrell Anthony played Rusty Shayne on
``Guiding Light.''
   The plot of the soap-within-the-play, ``Sunset,'' involves a
young woman who returns home to her sister after miscarrying the
child of a rich, married man, and running away from another man to
whom she had turned. The second man tracks her down and turns out
to be the first man's brother.
   In ``real life,'' Bushey's character is a beginner, an insecure
goofup who maddeningly wants to analyze scenes. Newman is newly
sober, trying to make a comeback, getting his role on ``Sunset''
through his sister, McClain. He was previously the star of another
soap, fired his lover, Collins, then lost his job through cocaine
and alcohol. Collins carries bitchy vindictiveness beyond the
``Sunset'' set.
   Servitto is in and out as comic relief in a series of campy,
cliche parts _ a deliveryman, a hairdresser, a stagehand who snores
through a love scene.
   Director A.C. Weary got his start directing on ``Another World''
and ``Guiding Light.'' Coup de Grace Productions in association
with 126 Second Ave. Corp. produced the show which was first seen
at the Westbeth Theater Center.
   ``Quiet on the Set'' is fun but has its slow spots. Kind of like
a soap opera.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disagreement by the two sides
over whether to kick dozens of allegedly corrupt officers out of
the army could push El Salvador into another round of civil war.
   On July 26, government and rebel negotiators ended a third
session of monthly U.N.-mediated peace talks with an accord on
human rights. They are to meet again Friday in San Jose, Costa Rica.
   July's agreements skirted armed forces reform, the main item on
the peace agenda and the key to ending a decade-long war that has
killed an estimated 72,000 people, most of them civilians.
   Salvadorans, barely recovered from the bloody rebel offensive of
November 1989, are waiting for the other shoe, a combat boot they
expect will crash down in the next few weeks.
   Leftist rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,
known as the FMLN, have warned of another major attack unless the
government agrees to steps toward ``demilitarization.''
   Acrimonious debate of the military's role has occupied more than
90 percent of the negotiating time and produced only cosmetic
changes in positions, with no agreement. Each side accuses the
other of intransigence.
   The army has been on alert since early July. Soldiers with
assault rifles are everywhere on downtown and suburban streets,
patrolling or manning roadblocks.
   Forced recruitment of young men has increased. Soldiers
routinely stop intercity buses to induct those who cannot prove
they have served already.
   Last month, citizens frightened by rumors of an imminent
guerrilla offensive stocked up on beans, a staple of the Salvadoran
diet, driving up the price.
   Seven points are on the peace agenda, but both sides agree the
only really sticky one is what to do about the army.
   El Salvador has held periodic elections since 1982 and tried to
consolidate some democratic institutions, but the military retains
tremendous influence.
   The main obstacle to an armistice that would disband the FMLN is
the dispute over the rebels' insistence that the high command be
purged of officers they accuse of corruption and abusing human
rights. The government and armed forces say that would amount to
interference with the military.
   Oscar Santamaria, the chief government negotiator, said in an
interview: ``The FMLN position appears designed to cripple the
armed forces rather than to change or reform them,''
   President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government has proposed
letting the armed forces police themselves. The rebels say history
shows the army cannot be trusted to do that.
   Despite evidence implicating the military in torture,
disappearances and thousands of murders, no officer has been
convicted of a crime involving the politically motivated abuse of
human rights.
   ``They are saying, `Trust us. We're going to be good from now
on,''' said Schafik Handal, a guerrilla commander and the chief
rebel negotiator. ``If we lay down our arms before agreeing on a
purge and an end to military impunity, there would be another
bloodbath like that of the early 1980s.''
   Guerrilla demands for a purge and a drastic reduction in the
army's numerical strength have struck a chord in a people who
traditionally view the army with a mixture of fear and contempt.
   ``Chafarote,'' the popular term for soldier, is a combination of
words meaning falseness and filth.
   ``I don't like the guerrillas, but I completely agree with their
demand for a purge and demilitarization,'' said the owner of a tile
factory. ``The military has been a scourge for this country.''
   As often happens in this violent nation, he asked that his name
not be used.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who follows
Central American affairs closely, said in July that 40 to 50
Salvadoran officers should be retired early or otherwise removed.
   Guerrilla spokesmen talk of purging 200 officers, but that is
seen as a negotiating figure subject to change. The rebels demand
only removal, not trials and punishment.
   Col. Mauricio Vargas, a brigade commander and member of the
government negotiating team, agreed that the military could benefit
from a change in its upper echelons, but said the process must be
gradual and internal.
   He said in an interview that about 10 top officers could be
removed in the next year, but that a more drastic housecleaning
would irreparably damage the command structure.
   The United States provides about $1 million a day in economic
and military aid to El Salvador. Earlier this year, the State
Department and U.S. Embassy appeared to be seeking some sort of
military shakeup, but recent comments indicate Washington has eased
the pressure.

<HEAD>Union Files Unfair Labor Charge Against NBC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a petition filed with the National Labor
Relations Board, a technical union at NBC accused the company of
unfair labor practices. NBC immediately denied the accusations.
   The charges by the National Association of Broadcast Employees
and Technicians were filed on the same day NBC put in effect
four-year contract proposal that a majority of the union's members
at NBC have rejected twice.
   The union, which represents 2,373 employees at NBC and NBC-owned
facilities, accused the company of ``failing and refusing to
bargain in good faith.'' Its previous contract expired on March 31.
   ``NBC has fully met its obligations under the National Labor
Relations Act,'' said NBC spokesman Joe Rutledge, who said the
company's final offer came after more than seven months of
negotiations and 35 separate meetings.
   ``We're confident that just as when NABET filed a similar
complaint in 1987, the NLRB will find the charges without merit.''
   The 1987 charge was filed during a bitter strike by the union
that lasted 17 weeks. No walkout this time is imminent. No strike
vote has been taken and union officials say they'll probably go to
court to fight NBC's action.

<TEXT>
   It has all the elements of a twangy tune
at the Grand Ole Opry. Steamy days in the South. Nights even hotter.
   She's an aspiring country music singer, and her love affair with
a married man is the town's gossip. The town is Nashville and the
man is the mayor.
   Traci Peel, 34, and Mayor Bill Boner, 45, have caught Nashville
up in a Dixie drama that sounds more like Tennessee Williams than
Tennessee government. They've even made the headlines of
supermarket tabloids.
   Boner, who left Congress in 1986 under the cloud of an ethics
investigation, announced in July that he and Peel are engaged.
   That turned some heads.
   The mayor is still married to his third wife, Betty. And at the
time his engagement was announced, the estranged Boners were living
under the same roof with their 4-year-old son.
   Boner said he met Peel in May at a golf tournament and the
relationship progressed until July 20.
   That's the day their romance hit the newsstands when the
Nashville Banner contacted Boner and Peel at her residence for an
interview.
   The Banner reported that Peel told a reporter Boner's passion
could last for seven continuous hours.
   ``That's pretty good for a 46-year-old man,'' Peel said.
   ``Forty-five,'' corrected Boner, who was on an extension.
   Peel denies the comments. The Banner stands by the story and
notes that neither Peel nor Boner has asked for a correction.
   Within days the quote prompted bumper stickers proclaiming:
``Seven Hours for Traci. Three Years for Metro.'' Boner's been
mayor for three years and has one more year to go.
   Peel sings in Nashville nightclubs and is occasionally joined by
Boner, who pulls out a harmonica and accompanies her.
   That scene prompted one editorial cartoonist to depict Boner as
the Nero of Nashville, fiddling while Nashville struggles with
garbage, water quality and other urban problems.
   The romance has become the stuff supermarket tabloids are made
of. In their headlines Boner has become a ``sex-mad mayor,'' Peel a
``country queen'' and their relationship ``The Grand Old Soap
Opry.''
   The syndicated television program ``A Current Affair'' had its
shot too, calling the romance Nashville's latest ``Hee Haw,'' after
the long-running syndicated television series.
   The publicity has irked Peel, who telephoned a radio talk show
Tuesday to complain the news media was making Nashville ``look like
`Hee Haw.' ''
   ``It's a sad, sad day when they have to mock our leaders, I
don't care who they are,'' Peel said on WLAC.
   Peel, who has been given a 2.2-carat diamond ring by Boner, told
The Associated Press on Wednesday that she has little more to say
other than she wishes the media would leave her alone.
   ``You've heard everything I had to say,'' she said. ``Just tell
it the way I said it.''
   Boner, a Democrat who decided before all this excitement not to
seek re-election, refused comment about the matter Wednesday.
   ``We're hoping it will go away,'' said his press secretary, Rick
Runyeon.
   On his weekly appearance Tuesday on an ``Ask Your Mayor''
television segment, Boner said the story has taken on a life of its
own.
   ``I don't have a thing to do with how the media chooses to
promote whatever they want to promote,'' Boner said. ``It's been a
series of misquotes and drawing things out of proportion.''
   The romance has ignited a flurry of letters to local newspapers.
   In a letter to the Nashville Banner, Susan Murphy complained
that the media should concentrate on reporting other news more
useful to citizens.
   ``A better informed voter is more likely to elect concerned
public servants and less inclined to elect do-nothing politicians,
such as the harmonica-playing Romeo currently occupying the mayor's
office,'' she wrote.

   Bandits armed with an Uzi robbed a pair of
FBI agents Wednesday and fled in a government car full of weapons
and radio equipment stolen from one of the lawmen, police said.
   No one was injured in the robbery that occurred at 12:30 p.m.
when the two agents, in separate government vehicles, stopped on a
street to discuss a case, said police Sgt. Greg Correa.
   ``As they were talking, a car drove up, and the passenger jumped
out carrying an Uzi,'' said Correa. ``He pointed it at one of the
agents, who jumped out of his car, ran away and leaped over a fence
to safety.''
   The gunman ordered the other agent out of his car, then got in
the government vehicle and sped away, the sergeant said. The
gunman's accomplice followed in the car the pair had arrived in.
   The stolen government car contained three handguns, a shotgun,
expensive radio equipment, the agent's badge and information on
active FBI cases, Correa said.
   The agents' names and the robbery location were withheld.
   Fred Reagan, spokesman for the FBI office in Los Angeles, could
not be immediately reached for comment.

   Saddam Hussein's sudden move to end a
standoff with Iran, his enemy in the 1980-88 gulf war, indicates he
may plan to tough it out in his desert confrontation with the
United States over the invasion of Kuwait.
   By making a deal with Iran, Saddam would do much to secure his
vulnerable eastern flank along the 730-mile border with Iran while
he faces a mounting buildup by U.S. and allied forces in Saudi
Arabia.
   Baghdad announced Wednesday that Saddam was prepared
unconditionally to withdraw his troops from Iranian territory
occupied in the closing stages of the eight-year Persian Gulf
conflict, exchange prisoners and relinquish a claim of sovereignty
over the disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway.
   Those were key obstacles in peace talks with Iran, and Saddam's
concessions show how much he is willing to compromise in order to
stand up to the Americans and prove himself the new Arab strongman
who will challenge Israel.
   Saddam said he was ``looking forward to a new life of
cooperation'' with Iran and suggested the two countries had a
common cause in an effort to ``deter those fishing in dirty
waters'' of the Persian Gulf.
   Negotiations for a peace treaty between Iraq and Iran to
formally end their war have been deadlocked virtually since they
began, five days after the U.N.-sponsored cease-fire took hold Aug.
20, 1988.
   The Iranians, frustrated at what they claim was Saddam's
stonewalling in the peace talks, threatened several times to take
back Iraqi-held territory in the central and southern sectors if
necessary.
   But in the last few months, Saddam has been trying to find a
face-saving formula to end the standoff. He and President Hashemi
Rafsanjani of Iran exchanged letters over several weeks and spoke
of holding a peace summit.
   Now, Saddam's package of concessions is an attempt to speed up
the process dramatically at a time when he has found himself in a
tight squeeze because of his seizure of Kuwait.
   ``Saddam has been looking for a political cover to make
concessions for some time,'' said analyst Philip Robbins of
London's Royal Institute of International Affairs.
   ``By heating up the issue of confronting Israel, he gave himself
an opportunity to show Iran they have a common enemy,'' Robbins
said in a telephone interview.
   On Sunday, Saddam linked his occupation of Kuwait to Israel's
control of the occupied territories and Syria's occuption of parts
of Lebanon.
   His invasion and annexation of Kuwait Aug. 2 set up a high-risk
confrontation with the United States that could well ignite the
Middle East in another conflagration if his current crusade against
Israel gains momentum.
   The United Nations imposed an economic blockade on Iraq while
the United States, Britain and other nations, including some Arab
states, sent forces to protect Saudi Arabia and enforce the U.N.
quarantine.
   ``It's a long way to go before he'd climb down over Kuwait. But
of course he's eating a lot of words in terms of Iran and he's able
to do that without losing face because of the position he's taken
up as a kind of champion of the Arab world,'' said Sir John
Moberly, Britain's Ambassador in Baghdad in 1982-85.
   ``He sees he has popularity . . . in some sections of the Arab
world and a lot at home, so he can afford to make concessions over
Iran,'' Moberly said in a British Broadcasting Corp. interview.
   Recent reports by diplomats and other knowledgeable sources said
that Iraq has an estimated 200,000 troops deployed in occupied
sectors of Iran and along the frontier that was the front-line for
much of the gulf war.
   It is possible that as many as half of those units could be
pulled back and redeployed in the south to bolster the more than
120,000 Iraqis facing the United States and its allies.
   How quickly they could be moved will depend on how long it takes
Saddam to reach agreement with Rafsanjani. The Iranians have
welcomed Saddam's offer, but while they have him over a barrel may
try to squeeze all they can out of him.
   Iraq has a 1-million-man military. But only about 200,000 of
those troops, including the elite Republican Guard divisions, can
be considered well-motivated, front-line fighters.
   The Iraqi army spent most of the gulf war fighting a static war
behind awesome defenses. By the time they went on the offensive in
the closing months of the conflict, the Iranians were largely
demoralized.
   Nonetheless, the Iraqis remain a formidable foe, with some 5,500
tanks, more than 500 combat aircraft, battlefield missiles _ and an
arsenal of chemical weapons.
   Saddam's move appears to be aimed more at shoring up his
defensive positions in the south than signalling any offensive
action against the burgeoning U.S. force massing in Saudi Arabia.
   ``I wouldn't think he's spoiling for a fight,'' Moberly noted.
``He's more likely simply to sit tight in Kuwait and hope that as
time passes the consensus that has built up in the international
world against what he's done . . . will begin to weaken.''
   Saddam's new move indicated that he fears the buildup of U.S.
and allied military strength will continue beyond the 50,000-man
level announced by Washington. And with Saddam responding with a
buildup in his forces, the possibility of a firefight increases.
   With the U.N. sanctions beginning to bite, Robbins suggested
that Saddam's move Wednesday could also benefit Iraq in another way.
   ``Reducing tension on the Iranian border will mean that
smuggling can take place to circumvent the embargo,'' he noted.

<HEAD>Mali Accused of Executing 29, Including Boy of 10</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Firing squads in Mali reportedly executed 29
people this month, apparently without trial, Amnesty International
says. The victims included an 80-year-old man and a 10-year-old
boy, it said.
   In an appeal Wednesday ``for an immediate halt to unlawful
killings'' in the sub-Saharan country, the worldwide human rights
organization said the victims belonged to the Tuareg ethnic group,
which had mounted an armed uprising in May and June following the
arrest of members of their tribe.
   It said more than 150 people may have been killed by the Tuareg
rebels, and some 120 Tuaregs were killed by government troops.
   The conflict prompted Malian authorities to declare a curfew and
state of emergency in the eastern districts of Gao, Kidal, Menaka
and Timbuktu, and security forces were given sweeping powers to use
force, a statement by Amnesty International said.
   ``Government forces subsequently took reprisals against Tuareg
civilians not involved in the conflict,'' it said. ``Encampments
were reportedly attacked and individuals arrested and tortured and
otherwise ill-treated.''
   Eleven Tuaregs were executed in Gao on Aug. 3, apparently after
being tortured, and their bodies crushed by a tank and abandoned
where they lay, the statement said.
   Three people were executed in Menaka, four in Kidal, two in
Ti-n-Essako and nine in the Tamesha area, it said.
   It said those shot by firing squad included Akhmad ag Makhakha,
80, leader of a Tuareg group; 10-year-old Bachar ag Khamadin, and
Issouf ag Dandan, an official of the ruling party, the Democratic
Union of the Malian People.
   Uprisings by the nomadic Tuaregs also have been reported in
adjacent Niger.

<TEXT>
   In a war few outside Poland recall,
soldiers of the newborn Polish republic 70 years ago this week
retaliated in a battle that saved Warsaw from Bolshevik conquest
and the wrath of the Red Army.
   Until last year, the Polish-Soviet war of 1919-20 was rarely
discussed by Poland's former Communist authorities because they
correctly gauged local sensitivities about the ``Miracle of the
Vistula.''
   But five days of observances about the battle that began Aug.
13, 1920, were organized in villages across Poland for the first
anniversary observance since the end of Communist rule.
   The ``Miracle on the Vistula'' has been recalled in churches and
cemeteries throughout Poland since Sunday, and memorials destroyed
or removed during the reign of the Communists have been carefully
restored.
   ``Many historians put this battle among the dozen most important
military acts,'' Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki said during a
Royal Castle ceremony Tuesday night honoring veterans of the battle.
   ``If not for the Polish determination, if not for our sacrifice
and our victory, the history of Europe would have been much
different,'' he told the elderly survivors.
   Ceremonies on Wednesday at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in
Warsaw and Thursday at the Krakow tomb of Marshal Jozef Pilsudski,
the champion of Polish independence who led the military campaign,
were to conclude observances that had captured Poland's emotions
all week.
   With central Europe in collapse after World War I and the German
working-class excited by Bolshevism's triumph in Russia, Soviet
leader Vladimir Lenin dreamed of conquering Poland, which would put
the Red Army in mid-Europe and spread the socialist revolution
across Europe.
   In the summer of 1920, five of the feared Soviet armies
converged on Warsaw.
   ``To the West! Over the corpse of White Poland lies the road to
worldwide conflagration,'' Soviet Gen. Mikhail Tukachevsky
instructed his troops before the battle, according to British
historian Norman Davies.
   ``White'' was Lenin's pejorative description meaning
counterrevolutionary enemies of the working-class. The czarist army
opposing the Bolsheviks dressed in white.
   Barbed-wire defenses hurriedly errected by Warsaw's residents
held, and in a series of daring maneuvers Poles managed to encircle
the Soviets. In days, 100,000 Red Army troops were taken prisoner
and the rest fled to East Prussia. East Prussia is former German
territory now belonging to Poland and the Soviet Union.
   In Poland, the unexpected triumph came to be called ``The
Miracle on the Vistula'' for the river that passes through Warsaw.
   ``Had (Polish soldiers) failed to arrest the triumphant advance
of the Soviet Army at the Battle of Warsaw, not only would
Christianity have experienced a dangerous reverse, but the very
existence of Western civilization would have been imperiled,''
wrote the then-British ambassador to Berlin, Lord D'Abernon,
according to Davies.
   The attention focused on Poland's heroic effort continues today,
Mazowiecki said. Thousands of people of all ages have been jamming
memorial Masses this week, decorating their villages with ribbons
in honor of the battle.
   ``The world is paying great attention to our experiences now
because it knows our process of freeing ourselves from communism
has critical importance for the world,'' Mazowiecki said.
   Polish primate Cardinal Jozef Glemp told worshippers that the
battle ``is still going on,'' referring to the trials of building a
democratic society after four decades of one-party rule.
   Glemp started the commemoration Sunday at a country church in
Radzymin, outside Warsaw near a battlefield where a rebuilt
cemetery chapel now honors the fallen soldiers.
   Among those attending was Col. Stanislaw Lis-Kozlowski, 84, a
teen-age volunteer from the Polish boy scouts who shouldered a
rifle against the Bolsheviks in 1920.
   Lis-Kozlowski, who came from his home in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, stood outside the church, his suit covered with medals
that recalled his service with the anti-Nazi resistance in World
War II and the doomed 1944 Warsaw uprising.
   He scoffed when a reporter suggested that as a 14-year-old he
was too young to fight. ``In the uprising in '44, I had soldiers 12
years old,'' Lis-Kozlowski said.
   For the Soviets, 1920 proved a temporary defeat. Stalin's troops
occupied more than half of Poland in 1939. After World War II,
Communists took power and ruled until 1989, when the Solidarity
movement wrested power from the party and installed a non-Communist
government.
   Many of the ``Miracle on the Vistula'' fighters perished among
the 15,000 captured Polish army officers executed by the Soviets at
Katyn and two other sites in 1940. In Poland, the crime often is
viewed as Stalin's revenge for 1920.

<HEAD>Dreaded, Defunct Secret Police Still Haunt East Germany</HEAD>

   East Germany's dreaded secret police force is
dead, but its chilling legacy still haunts the troubled nation.
   On Wednesday, a top official of East Germany's leading political
party was suspended following allegations he worked for the secret
police for 15 years.
   Once the heart of Communist repression, the secret police opened
mail, tapped phones, spied on nearly everyone, threw people in jail
and kept its own arsenals.
   East German officials say the secret police also harbored
terrorists, including some of West Germany's most wanted fugitives.
   All that came to a gradual end after the Communists were toppled
in December, but the fallout forms a sinister undercurrent to this
day.
   Earlier this week, prosecutors in both countries said they were
investigating allegations the secret police murdered some of those
who ran afoul of the regime.
   There has been rampant speculation about who may have been
killed by the secret police.
   The mass-circulation West German newspaper Bild said there is
suspicion the secret police ``killed regime opponents in cold
blood'' and tried to cover up the murders as accidents. It says the
victims included ``politicians, show stars and athletes.''
   In the front-page story Wednesday, Bild raised the question of
whether American singer Dean Reed was one of the victims.
   Reed, who lived in East Germany and was the darling of country
music fans throughout the Soviet bloc, was found dead in a lake
outside East Berlin in June 1986.
   Erich Honecker's Communist regime said Reed died in a ``tragic
accident,'' although rumors of foul play abound.
   Bild said Reed had been considering moving back to the United
States shortly before his death, and the secret police may have
wanted to kill him to prevent him from undermining what for the
East German Communists had been a propaganda coup.
   The secret police, known as the Stasi, once numbered about
200,000 full-time workers and informants. Some say the number was
actually higher.
   Virtually everyone had some kind of contact with the Stasi at
one time or another.
   For many, those contacts crossed the line from unavoidable
encounters to active cooperation.
   On Wednesday morning, a news magazine said that the general
secretary of the Christian Democratic Union, Martin Kirchner, was a
paid informant for 15 years.
   Kirchner was even working for the intelligence network when he
met last year with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, according to West
Germany's Stern magazine.
   His alleged mission was to bring back information to help Stasi
bosses prepare for the time after Honecker's ouster on Oct. 18.
   Within hours after Stern released its report, Kirchner, the
party's No. 2 official, was suspended pending investigation, even
though he had denied similar allegations in the past.
   The East German Christian Democrats under Prime Minister Lothar
de Maiziere are the nation's dominant party.
   Kirchner isn't the first politician felled by alleged links to
the Stasi.
   Wolfgang Schnur, a leader of Democratic Start, quit in March
amid a furor over his reported ties to the Stasi.
   Similar allegations also led to the resignation of Ibrahim
Boehme as chief of the influential Social Democrats.
   Almost every week, there have been fresh insights into Stasi's
omnipresent role.
   Last month, the democratically elected government in East Berlin
said the Communists had harbored the notorious Venezuelan terrorist
Carlos.
   Officials also believe the Stasi knew well in advance of the
April 1986 bombing of the La Belle discotheque in West Berlin.
   The bombing left two American soldiers and a Turkish woman dead,
and led to U.S. air raids on Libya 10 days later.
   East Germans have been arguing over what to do with former Stasi
agents, since many people refuse to employ them.
   But for the 82-year-old former secret police boss, the future
seems fairly certain. Erich Mielke is in jail pending investigation
of criminal charges of abuse of power.

<HEAD>Law Grad's Smart Answers Not Intelligent, Board Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A law graduate accused of making wisecracks on his
bar exam application wishes the test's administrators would just
lighten up.
   ``I never meant to be disrespectful. Cute, maybe,'' said Charles
Malloy, 28, a 1989 graduate of Southern Methodist University Law
School.
   The State Board of Legal Examiners found nothing cute about
Malloy's answers to four questions on the application. It twice
barred him from taking the exam.
   Last week, a state appeals court told the board that Malloy has
a ``spirited bumptiousness'' but not a lack of moral character.
Forced to test him, the panel appointed by the state Supreme Court
is refusing to release his score.
   ``I can't get hired anywhere because the standard question is,
`Have you passed the bar? And I have to go into this long story,''
Malloy said in today's Dallas Times Herald. In the meantime, he is
working on a master's degree in corporate tax law.
   The board has said it will take the case all the way to the
state Supreme Court.
   Malloy contended he wasn't being flip when he responded to a
question asking why he was fired from an accounting firm in 1985
with: ``Why don't you ask them and let me know because I have been
wondering now for 3{ years.''
   The second question was whether he had ever been charged with or
convicted of a crime. He was found innocent in 1987 of disorderly
conduct and evading arrest after lecturing a police officer who had
crashed a rowdy SMU party.
   He was charged the next year with failing to identify himself to
police after he and two friends reportedly yelled into a broken
speaker at a drive-thru at a fast food restaurant. The charge was
dismissed.
   The charges were misdemeanors. He didn't have to report them.
But the board said once he did, he was in ``flagrant
non-compliance'' for failing to provide court records.
   The third question was whether Malloy had ever undergone
counseling. Malloy had, as a teen-ager after his brother's death.
He gave the name of the psychiatrist but added, ``This stuff is
really none of your business as it does not affect my ability to
practice law in Texas.''
   Asked whether he could vow to uphold the U.S. and Texas
constitutions, he wrote, ``Absolutely! I'm a Constitutional kind of
guy.''
   The board said those answers demonstrated immaturity, a lack of
respect for authority and a lack of moral character.
   Malloy's law school friends are standing behind him.
   ``He's not some unintelligent yahoo who's trying to fight the
system just to be fighting it. In corporate tax, he made the top
grade in the class,'' said Barrett Davis, 26, who works for a
Dallas law firm.

   Five Persian Gulf countries have
agreed to devote prime television time to a program by the exiled
government of Kuwait.
   The agreement was reached Wednesday by the ministers of Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, members of
the Gulf Cooperation Council with Kuwait.
   Kuwait's government fled when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, set
up a provisional government and declared it had ``annexed'' the
oil-rich country. The U.N. Security Council said the annexation was
``null and void.''
   The Kuwaiti government-in-exile now operates from a base in the
Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia.
   An official statement said the information ministers met in
emergency session on how to respond to the Iraqi invasion.
   The joint information plan envisaged a rupture of cooperation
with Iraq ``in all forms,'' the statement said.
   The ``State of Kuwait'' would prepare a special TV program that
would be broadcast daily from the other countries of the Gulf
Cooperation Council after the main daily news bulletins, the
statement said.
   The council also criticized peace overtures Wednesday by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein toward Iran.
   ``The ministers expressed astonishment over Iraq's about-face
that cast doubt about its credibility and seriousness,'' they said
in their statement.
   ``The ministers questioned the real motives behind the Iraqi
policy that cost the lives of hundreds of thousands, destruction of
installations and loss of vast funds,'' said ministers, referring
to the eight-year war between Iraq and Iran. Fighting ended in a
truce in August 1988, but peace talks had bogged down.

   An actor who played Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin
on the stage will portray President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in an
upcoming U.S. film, a newspaper reported.
   Vladimir Troshin of the Moscow Khudozhestvenny Theater will
portray the current Soviet leader in the film ``Final Warning,''
the newspaper Moscow News said Wednesday.
   In the film, directed by Tony Page, Troshin will play Gorbachev
in a scene in which the Soviet leader receives U.S. industrialist
Armand Hammer and Dr. Robert Gale, who treated victims of the
Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the newspaper said. The film is based
on Gale's book of the same name.
   Troshin, 64, reportedly spent many hours studying Gorbachev's
speeches and manners on television.
   He previously portrayed Lenin in the play ``The Kremlin Clock.''

   The lid has popped off Tupperware's secret
new product for 1990, and the plastic kitchenware giant is steamed.
   The Peoria Journal Star reported Wednesday that Tupperware's
``revolutionary new product line'' is a group of stackable
microwave dishes.
   ``The paper really did a number on us,'' said Alan Luce,
Tupperware vice president for administration. ``This was a major
product breakthrough for us. It was not like a new tumbler or
color. This was a major secret.''
   The new line was to have been unveiled nationally Aug. 27. But
the newspaper Tuesday got a reporter inside a closed session of a
Tupperware convention when the product was introduced to a jubilant
crowd of dealers and sales managers.
   Luce said the story ``ruined the fun, surprise and excitement''
for conventioneers attending sessions later this week in Peoria,
Long Beach, Calif., and Orlando, Fla.
   ``We've got 110,000 independent Tupperware dealers in the United
States. We prefer that they know about our new products before the
general public knows,'' said Lawrie Pitcher Platt, spokeswoman at
Tupperware headquarters in Orlando.
   Mayor Jim Maloof said his secretary received several calls from
upset Tupperware officials. He said he called the newspaper to ask
if the story could be pulled from its evening editions. The paper
refused.
   ``I don't understand what's the big deal. They had news, and we
went and got it,'' said Jack Brimeyer, assistant managing editor.
``We didn't treat them any differently than any other business or
news story.''
   The mayor also said he had heard Tupperware had threatened to
cancel its three-year contract to hold conventions in Peoria.
   The company plans to hold its 1991 convention in Hawaii for
Tupperware's 40th anniversary, but Luce said that had nothing to do
with the Tupperware flap.
   The new line is called Tupperwave. It's a nine-piece selection
of casserole-type dishes and accessories that can be stacked
three-high in a microwave to allow simultaneous cooking of entrees,
side dishes and desserts.
   In unveiling the product Tuesday to Tupperware representatives
from 17 Midwest states, vice president Larry Camberon said:
``There's not a company in the world that has stack cooking in a
microwave. Those people at Rubber Maid don't know anything about
it.''
   ``We're going to take America by storm with stack cooking in a
microwave,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.

<HEAD>Administration Wants to Seek More Oil Drilling in Wake of Gulf
Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration wants to use the
Persian Gulf crisis _ and resulting gasoline price increases _ to
push for oil drilling in an Alaskan wildlife refuge and other
environmentally sensitive areas.
   ``Once Congress gets back, the (Interior) Department and others
will try to make a strong case for Congress to act in allowing
exploration of the coastal plain'' of the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge, said Tom DeRocco, chief of public affairs for the Minerals
Management Service.
   The White House also hopes the Mideast turmoil and increasing
gas prices will galvanize public opinion for exploration and
drilling in some offshore areas.
   ``Now that people are having to pay higher prices at the gas
pump, there's a heightened awareness of the issue,'' said Steven
Goldstein, chief spokesman for the Interior Department.
   However, President Bush will not alter his June decision to
block new drilling off most of California, Southern Florida,
Washington and Oregon, officials said. That decision barred
offshore oil activity in those areas for at least a decade.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins said Wednesday the United States
could use stepped-up oil production and conservation to replace up
to 90 percent of the oil supplies lost because of the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.
   Half the saving would come if Americans accept conservation
measures that, for example, would require them to keep tires
properly inflated and drive within the speed limit, he said.
Increased oil production could require compromises on the
environment, Watkins added.
   The oil industry has pushed for years to open the northeastern
Alaska refuge's 1.5-million-acre coastal stretch to drilling, in
hopes that it contains huge deposits of oil and gas.
   Environmentalists see the refuge as a crucial test of Bush's
commitment following his pledge to be an ``environmental
president.'' They say the refuge is a national treasure with a
complete spectrum of arctic ecosystems, including a home for polar
bears, millions of birds, and a calving area for the Porcupine
Caribou herd.
   Bush has long wanted oil exploration in the Alaska refuge, but
Congress decreed in 1980 that it must give permission before any
drilling can occur.
   Ben Beach of the Wilderness Society said the Middle East crisis
likely will help the Bush administration counter public opposition
to oil development.
   ``Politically it makes it easier for them'' to push for
exploration, Beach said.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan _ in a meeting with White House
Chief of Staff John Sununu's deputy, Andy Card _ got the go-ahead
to start the drumbeat toward opening the Alaska refuge, said an
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The administration also is interested in moving ahead with
exploration in other states that have been protected by
congressional moratoriums, said Goldstein of the Interior
Department.
   That could include areas offshore in North Carolina, Bristol
Bay, Alaska, South Carolina and other coastal regions. Goldstein
said the administration wants to see stepped-up oil production off
Santa Barbara County, Calif., where drilling already is underway.
   But the administration is not likely to invoke powers that allow
the federal government to override local decisions when it is
deemed in the national interest, said Goldstein.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, announced as Congress left for its
August recess that he will urge passage of legislation to open the
way for exploring the Alaska wildlife refuge.
   That bill had languished in the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil
spill last year in Alaska's Prince William Sound left the coastline
and wildlife covered with black muck.
   Lawmakers return from summer recess in mid-September.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said he hoped the Persian Gulf
crisis will boost the chances of his bill to allow exploration of
the refuge as one alternative if U.S. oil imports exceed half of
consumption. Imports account for 52 percent of U.S. oil, he said.
   Goldstein noted that Lujan for months ``has been out there
trying to tell people we're becoming too dependent on foreign oil.
Unfortunately the issue of offshore oil became very emotional,'' he
said.
   ``There was a consistent line of tanker accidents. Now people
are seeing something that is even more distressing to them. They
are paying more for gasoline,'' he said.

   No longer hatchet-wielding
prohibitionists, the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union
nevertheless is still battling the bottle.
   But instead of busting up saloons, the 500 delegates at the
group's 116th annual convention have set their sights on the
classroom, hoping to steer youngsters away from booze as well as
drugs and alcohol.
   ``We believe in teaching children not to start drinking. Then
someday we'll be able to sit back and watch legalized
prohibition,'' said its president, Rachel Kelly of Portland, Me.
The four-day convention opened Wednesday.
   The union, which claims to be the world's oldest and largest
Christian women's group with 150,000 members in the United States
and 350,000 abroad, also campaigns against abortion and pornography
and establishes missionaries.
   Its members are in their mid-50s on average, and many are
educators. On joining they must sign an oath that they will not
drink or smoke. Men can join only as honorary members.
   Founded in 1874, the Evanston, Ill.-based union helped hasten
passage of the 18th Amendment in 1919. Its members stormed
speakeasies with hatchets until Prohibition was repealed in 1933.
   Nowadays, Kelly said, ``We do things quietly. We don't march. We
don't shout. We don't pound Bibles.''
   WCTU spokesman Michael Vitucci said Prohibition failed because
``it had no reason.''
   In the 1920s, many people were not educated about why they
should avoid alcohol. But now, auto accidents, drug abuse and crime
linked to drinking have sobered up many people to the benefits of
abstinence, Vitucci said.
   ``These are very intelligent women who realize that the alcohol
industry has a great stranglehold on this nation,'' Vitucci said.
``The WCTU believes that today with education ... our youth will
hopefully place a self-prohibition on these substances.''
   The group has for years pressed Congress to ban alcohol
advertisements on television and to raise federal taxes on alcohol.
The alcohol industry has had ``a free ride long enough,'' said WCTU
vice president Merry Lee Christy.
   The group publishes books and pamphlets for teen-agers and
adults. Its literature is used to teach the young, from
kindergarten to the U.S. Air Force Academy and U.S. Military
Academy, about the damage that alcohol can cause.
   Children can join its Loyal Tolerance Legion and teen-agers can
say no to alcohol in its Youth Tolerance Council.
   ``We have fun like everyone else. We just don't drink,'' said
Rodney Perry, a 17-year-old delegate from Milton.
   At this convention, the opening banquet featured chicken and
rice pilaf. There was no cocktail hour.
   ``Our happy hour starts when we sit down to eat,'' said Doris
Christy, West Virginia chapter president.

<HEAD>US Intervention in Persian Gulf is Sparking Little Protest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's streets and campuses, which rang
with protest in the era of Vietnam, are quiet as the Bush
administration challenges Iraq's Saddam Hussein in the Persian
Gulf. They may or may not stay that way.
   From Washington to San Francisco, protest demonstrations have
been few and poorly attended since the United States sent troops to
Saudi Arabia in response to Saddam's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Summer school is winding up at the nation's colleges and
universities, and most students are away, but even for summer the
response has been notably calm.
   One reason is that Americans view Saddam as a villain, whereas
many thought the United States overreached in its bombing of North
Vietnam, according to experts who have observed anti-war movements
both from within and from without.
   ``Here is a case where there is an absolute clear aggressor in
people's minds,'' said Neil Smelser, a professor of sociology at
the University of California in Berkeley who studies social
movements of political protest.
   An Associated Press poll conducted last week showed 64 percent
approval for the use of U.S. troops to defend Saudi Arabia against
possible Iraqi attack.
   This could change, said Smelser, who was teaching at Berkeley
during the Vietnam war when the campus was the scene of violent
demonstrations.
   ``It's a delicate thing,'' he said. ``If there is the slightest
move that could be interpreted by our own people that we are
overstepping or making an illegitimate move, it is very easy to see
the possibility of the kind of protest that has been seen in
Vietnam and Central America arising.''
   Todd Gitlin, a sociology department colleague of Smelser who was
a leader of the militant Students for a Democratic Society during
the Southeast Asian war, said he would not be surprised if there
were protests when students return next month.
   However, Gitlin said, ``The only scenario in which I could
imagine protest of the Vietnam magnitude would be one in which a
great deal of damage is done to American forces and people don't
feel that the intervention is legitimate.''
   ``There is not a lot of love lost for Saddam Hussein,'' he
added. ``I think many people on the left who are suspicious of
American intervention ... don't like Saddam Hussein. They don't
like what he did.''
   Burton Yale Pines, senior vice president of the conservative
Heritage Foundation, who was a foreign correspondent and editor for
Time magazine during Vietnam, said he does not foresee a wave of
protest.
   ``There is no good guy, romantic guy, whom we ostensibly are
beating up on, a good romantic Ho Chi Minh,'' said Pines, referring
to the nationalist figure who led communist North Vietnam during
the war. Saddam, he said, ``is a guy whom almost the whole world is
against.''
   In Seattle, where throngs marched in Vietnam protests, a
demonstration in front of the Federal Building on Monday drew about
30 peace activists. In Minneapolis last week about the same number
turned out for a similar rally.
   In Washington, a demonstration outside the Pentagon attracted
only a handful of protesters. In New York and San Francisco, no
demonstrations of note were reported.
   Tom Debley, a University of California spokesman, said, ``There
was a small group that said they were going to do something the
other day, but we never saw anything materialize.''
   At Kent State University in Ohio, where student protests led to
the fatal shooting of four students by National Guardsmen on May 4,
1970, spokeswoman Susan Rogers said: ``The student groups aren't
meeting, as they do during the academic year. I believe there are
probably student groups that will take that issue up in the fall.''
   While there is no wave of protest, there have been ripples.
   The Friends Committee for National Legislation in Washington has
sent out a statement urging Quaker activists to ``try to change
this potentially dangerous policy.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's speech to the AMVETS in Atlanta
Tuesday was interrupted by two young women chanting, ``U.S. out of
the Persian Gulf.'' They were escorted from the building.
   At the Oakland, Calif., headquarters of the militant National
Pledge of Resistance, co-coordinator Darla Rucker said that
organization, which has focused on Central America, is educating
itself about the Middle East.
   ``There have been small demonstrations happening,'' she said.
``My feeling is that when there is actual military action that is
going on with U.S. troops is when the concern level will escalate.''

<HEAD>Doctors: Margarine Isn't So Great for Your Cholesterol After All</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cholesterol-conscious people have long been
saying, ``Hold the butter.'' Now a study suggests they should
spread the margarine sparingly too.
   The study found that hardened vegetable fat, a primary
ingredient of margarine and shortening, raises cholesterol in the
blood. It might even be worse than saturated fat, the
long-recognized demon in the war on unhealthy eating.
   Experts cautioned that margarine is still a healthier choice
than butter. However, the new research contradicts the widely held
belief that the vegetable fats that margarine contains are harmless
to the heart.
   The study raises questions about trans fatty acids, which make
margarine and shortening hard so they can be used for baking,
frying and spreading. About a quarter of the fat in a typical stick
of margarine is trans fatty acids.
   While such fats can occur naturally, most are made when food
companies add hydrogen to polyunsaturated and monounsaturated
vegetable oils. Food labels list these as hydrogenated oils.
   Because these fats make up only 2 percent to 4 percent of a
typical American diet, they probably have small impact on most
people's cholesterol levels.
   However, Dr. Scott Grundy, a top cholesterol expert at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, said the
public should insist that the food industry find a way to eliminate
trans fatty acids from margarine.
   ``Industry will say there is not enough to hurt people, but this
paper points out that this is a contributing factor,'' he said.
``It should not be ignored.''
   The study found that unlike saturated fat, trans fatty acids
have a double-barreled harmful effect: They increase the
bloodstream's supply of low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, the ``bad
cholesterol'' that contributes to fatty buildups in the arteries.
And they lower levels of high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, the
``good cholesterol'' that protects the body from cholesterol's
harmful effects.
   Grundy called this ``a combination of detrimental effects that
is particularly worrisome.''
   Dr. Edward A. Emken of the U.S. Department of Agriculture
research service in Peoria, Ill., said the study should be repeated
to check the effects of lower doses of the fat. But he said the
research ``has implications in terms of the U.S. diet, and it
certainly shouldn't be taken lightly.''
   In a statement, the International Food Information Council, an
industry group, said, ``People should refrain from making any
dietary changes based on the results of this one study in which
subjects consumed extremely high levels of trans fatty acids for a
relatively short time.''
   The study was conducted in the Netherlands by Drs. Ronald P.
Mensink and Martijn B. Katan of the Agricultural University in
Wageningen. It was published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   The study was conducted on 59 men and women who were randomly
assigned to eat three different diets for three weeks each. In each
diet, 40 percent of the total calories came from fat. But they
varied in their levels of monounsaturated fats, trans fatty acids
and saturated fats.
   Their average cholesterol levels were 172 on the monounsaturated
fat diet, 182 on the trans fatty acid diet and 193 on the saturated
fat diet.
   However, many experts believe that the ratio of total
cholesterol to HDL is a more important sign of potential heart
disease than is total cholesterol alone. And in this regard, trans
fatty acids came off worse than saturated fat.
   The lower the ratio, the lower people's risk of heart disease.
In this experiment, the ratio was 3.13 on the monounsaturated fat
diet, 3.51 on trans fatty acids and 3.79 on saturated fats.
   The Dutch researchers estimated that if Americans stopped eating
all trans fatty acids and instead used monounsaturated fats, such
as olive oil, they would raise their HDL levels two points and
lower their LDL levels four points.

<HEAD>Military Elite Blocking Probe Into Priest Murders, Moakley Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   El Salvador's military high command has
conspired to silence witnesses and destroy evidence surrounding the
murders of six Jesuit priests in 1989, charges the chairman of a
House task force.
   ``I believe that the High Command's goal from the beginning has
been to control the investigation and to limit the number and rank
of the officers who will be held responsible for the crimes,'' Rep.
Joe Moakley, D-Mass., said in a statement Wednesday.
   Moakley's statement followed a trip to El Salvador last week by
the staff the task force, appointed earlier this year by House
Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., to look into the murders of the
priests, their housekeeper and her daughter Nov. 16 at a university
in San Salvador.
   Little progress has been made since April, when the task force
found that the investigation had come to a virtual standstill. Nine
military men, including a colonel, were charged in connection with
the killings, but none has come to trial.
   ``These military people are trying to play us for saps,''
Moakley said in a telephone interview from his home on Cape Cod.
``They feel we just don't remember things, that it's going to go
away and be business as usual. I look at all the money spent, and
all the lies over the years, and it's time to call a halt to it.
   ``Salvadoran military officers have withheld evidence, destroyed
evidence, falsified evidence and repeatedly perjured themselves in
testimony. I do not believe this could be done without at least the
tacit consent of the High Command.''
   Despite efforts by the judge, Ricardo Zamora, and pressure from
President Alfredo Cristiani and U.S. Ambassador William Walker,
``some individuals who may have direct knowledge of the murders
have been shielded from serious investigation,'' Moakley said.
   None of the hundreds of military personnel in the area around
the university has volunteered any information, Moakley said.
   Log books that would show movements of military personnel in the
area on that night have been burned, and some of those questioned
have had questionable memory lapses, he said.
   Some potential witnesses have been transferred to posts outside
the country, he noted. And an intelligence officer who told fellow
officers of the murders the morning after they occurred later said
he had heard the news on the radio. No radio stations had been
carrying the news at that time, Moakley said.
   The Democratic task force is pressing the Bush administration
for sharp restrictions in next year's planned $85 million in U.S.
military aid to El Salvador. In all, the United States is spending
some $315 million this year on aid to El Salvador, much of it
economic and food aid for an economy wracked by a decade-old civil
war with leftist guerillas.
   Moakley said there still was hope for a breakthrough, however,
because some military officials not involved in the murders are
angered that the case has threatened foreign aid to the army.
``Pressure is growing for an end to the conspiracy of silence,'' he
said.
   Moakley added that task force staff members have interviewed
members of the Salvadoran military who ``are very upset with the
situation, and who do everything but actually point to the High
Command as the source of the troubles.''
   The government and the guerillas have embarked on United
Nations-sponsored peace talks, which are scheduled to resume next
week in San Jose, Costa Rica.

   Scientists today reported progress in
understanding how an anticancer gene protects against lung and
breast cancer.
   In a study in the British journal Nature, the researchers said
that the retinoblastoma gene guards against cancer by shutting down
a gene involved in the stimulation of cell growth.
   Further studies are aimed at exactly how the retinoblastoma gene
accomplishes that, said one of the authors of the study, Paul
Robbins of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.
   ``If we can understand the way in which retinoblastoma
functions, we might be able to apply that to treatment of some of
these forms of cancer,'' Robbins said.
   The research was done at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge,
which Robbins just left. His colleagues were Richard Mulligan and
Jonathan Horowitz, who has recently moved to the Duke University
Medical School in Durham, N.C.
   Researchers have suspected that the retinoblastoma might act by
shutting off one or more cell-growth genes. But they didn't know
which ones.
   Failure of the retinoblastoma gene is one of several steps that
can allow the growth of not only lung and breast cancer but also
bladder cancer, prostate cancer and a rare eye cancer called
retinoblastoma, in which the gene was first identified.
   The growth gene regulated by retinoblastoma is called the fos
gene, Robbins showed. When the retinoblastoma gene is defective and
cannot do its job, the fos gene can help trigger the runaway cell
growth characteristic of cancer tumors.
   The fos ``promoter,'' its on-off switch, can normally be
stimulated in a laboratory dish by blood serum. Mulligan's paper
shows that when the protein made by the retinoblastoma gene is
thrown into the dish, the stimulation is slowed.
   The researchers have not yet shown precisely how the protein
acts on the fos promoter and whether, for example, other proteins
are involved.
   ``If these results lead to further experiments that show the
retinoblastoma protein acts directly on the fos promoter, it's a
breakthrough paper,'' said Edward Harlow of the Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory, an expert on tumor-suppressor genes.

   Commercial jetliners may be pulled off regular
commercial routes if military aircraft and hired charters can't
airlift troops and cargo fast enough to the Middle East.
   Airline representatives said Wednesday they have been notified
by the Pentagon that commercial flights may have to be diverted to
accommodate the steady stream of troops and cargo.
   ``We have been contacted by the government and made aware that
they could, during this military activity, be in need of up to
three of our Boeing 747s,'' said Northwest Airlines spokesman
Douglas Miller.
   ``We're prepared, if they need any or all of these planes, to
make them available,'' he said.
   If regularly scheduled airliners are diverted, it would be the
first use of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet since the program was
conceived in the 1950s. Under the program, airlines prepare and
commit specific aircraft that can be used to carry troops or
military cargo in times of crisis. The airlines are reimbursed.
   So far, military used of commercial charters has not been
extensive enough to require disruption of scheduled flights. Sgt.
Mark Jackson of the Military Airlift Command at Scott Air Force
Base says the reserve plan has not been put into effect so far.
   But airline officials say they have been told to be ready.
   ``U.S. airlines have been told to be on the alert,'' said Karen
Ceremsak, spokeswoman for Eastern Airlines in Miami. She said the
airline, which has flown two military charter flights since Iraq
took over Kuwait, has several narrow-body planes dedicated to the
reserve fleet.
   None of Eastern's planes in the program are large enough to fly
troops all the way to Saudi Arabia, she said. Eastern officials
have told the military it might be able to use the planes either to
ferry troops to other flights or to relieve planes on other
military flights, she said.
   United spokesman Rob Doughty said the Chicago-based carrier has
62 aircraft committed to the reserve fleet, primarily 747s and
DC10s. He declined to say whether any military flights had been
made or planned.
   ``I cannot make comment about what we're doing or if we are
doing anything,'' Doughty said, citing company privacy rules that
apply to any customer.
   He said, however, that rumors of hundreds of pilots being called
to active duty are untrue. He said about 50 of United's 8,000
pilots were on active duty this week, but this was not far above
the normal for any summer week when reserve officers are required
to attend training camps.
   ``We've had no disruption in service,'' he said.
   Doughty said the airline has arranged with the pilots union to
continue operations if there is a wider military call-up.
   Military officials have not disclosed how many planes or which
airlines have been hired for the airlift, which so far has been
handled as a regular commercial business deal.
   ``We're not talking about numbers of flights or specific routes
or airlines that are being used,'' Jackson said. ``It's still early
enough in the operation and critical enough that we're not
divulging details of the flights.''

<HEAD>News Rules Said to Protect Soldiers' Families, Secure Information</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon says restrictions on information
U.S. journalists in Saudi Arabia can report are designed to protect
soldiers' families and deny military information to Iraq.
   One of the ground rules prevents journalists from disclosing the
size of troop units or where they are located in the desert in the
dispatches that are shared with the nation's news media on a
``pool'' basis.
   ``That's the kind of stuff the Iraqis would love to know ... You
might as well be giving them grid coordinates to set their
artillery for,'' a Pentagon official said Wednesday. He asked to
remain unidentified.
   Another restriction on the 15-member pool of U.S. journalists,
flown to Saudi Arabia by the Pentagon over the weekend, prohibits
them from identifying individual soldiers _ except command-level
officers _ by name.
   That rule is in place to protect the GIs' families in the United
States, the Pentagon official said.
   ``You have people who don't much care for the fact that we're
there in the first place and who want to strike back at a target,''
he said.
   Photographers are not prevented from taking pictures of anything
they see, but a group of U.S. military ``escorts'' control where
the pool reporters and photographers are taken each day.
   A military official does a ``security review'' of the stories
before they are dispatched to the reporter's Washington bureau.
Then a Pentagon official in Washington gives it a final review
before it is allowed to be distributed by wire services and to
other news organizations.
   The Defense Department pool in Saudi Arabia includes seven print
reporters _ one each from The Associated Press, the Los Angeles
Times, Scripps Howard News Service, the Milwaukee Journal, United
Press International, Reuters and Time magazine.
   It also includes a National Public Radio reporter, still
photographers from the AP, UPI and Time and a CNN television crew.

   A shootout during an attempted bank
robbery killed 11 people and wounded four in a town outside the
capital, police said.
   Six of the gunmen were killed and three fled the scene following
the shootout Wednesday, the police said. Among the five others
killed were a math teacher, a guard and an army major, said the
police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. The other two
were not identified.
   The sources said nine men armed with AK-47 assault rifles were
met by a hail of bullets from guards when they tried to hold up a
branch of the Capitalizadora Hondurena bank in El Zamorano, a town
about 20 miles east of Tegucigalpa, the capital.
   The gunmen were dressed in uniforms of the El Zamorano College,
an agricultural school financed by the U.S. government. Police
investigators believe they were members of a leftist terrorist
organization, the sources said without elaborating.

   The government's Nazi-hunting agency wants to
revoke the citizenship of a Somerset, N.J., man alleged to have
killed Jewish prisoners at the Koldyczewo concentration camp in
World War II Poland.
   The Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations said

``Shutzmannschaft,'' the local police controlled by Nazi Germany,
and participated in killing Jewish and other prisoners at the camp
as well as Jews in and around the city of Baranowicze.
   Baranowicze, then part of Poland, now is in the Byelorussian
Soviet Socialist Republic in the Soviet Union.
   The OSI said in a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in
Newark that Hutyrczyk was a supervising guard known to Koldyczewo
inmates as the ``Black Commander.''
   So far, 32 former Nazis have been stripped of U.S. citizenship

<HEAD>Unwed Births Climb to One in Four</HEAD>

   The government says one of every four births
in the United States in 1988 was to an unwed mother. The 1 million
births to unmarried women was an 8 percent increase over the
previous year.
   The report Wednesday by the Department of Health and Human
Services said that while the rates for children born out of wedlock
were highest among black women, the rates have been rising faster
for white mothers.
   The statistics also showed a rise in births to young teen-agers
for the second straight year, after declining through much of the
1970s and 1980s. There were 33.8 births per 1,000 population to
teen-agers ages 15 to 17.
   Nearly two in three births to unwed mothers was among blacks.
   Since unmarried mothers are much less likely than married
mothers to begin prenatal care early, the proportion of women
beginning such care in the first trimester showed no improvement
through the 1980s and remains at 76 percent, HHS said.
   The percentage was particularly low among black and Hispanic
women.

<HEAD>Gunman Gets Past Airport Security at National</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former worker at National Airport was being
held after hijacking a fuel truck, wounding two people and driving
the vehicle into a restricted area with access to runways earlier
this week, authorities said.
   Jeffrey Garland, 29, of Woodbridge, Va., commandeered the
aviation fuel truck owned by his former employer and forced a
worker to use his clearance to get past security fences Tuesday
night, said airports authority spokesman Dave Hess.
   Garland fired a gun and wounded two of the three maintenance men
who had tried to stop the truck, Hess said. One man was slightly
injured, and the other was hospitalized with a gunshot wound in the
thigh.
   The gunman fled before getting near any aircraft, Hess said.
   ``Apparently he didn't get too far,'' Hess said. ``There were no
aircraft where he was, certainly no large aircraft.''
   Still, Hess acknowledged nothing stood between the gunman and
the busy airport's runways.
   Police arrested the gunman without incident after he had flagged
down a passenger shuttle bus, then fled the bus. It was not known
whether there were any passengers on the bus.
   Garland was being held at nearby Arlington County jail in lieu
of $100,000 bond on charges of abduction, two counts of malicious
wounding and unauthorized use of a vehicle.
   Airport police said a later search turned up a pair of homemade
gasoline bombs in Garland's car.
   Authorities said Garland had worked for Ogden Allied Services
until he voluntarily left his job in May. Ogden Allied is the
company that fuels airliners at National.

<HEAD>U.S. Women Soldiers Give Saudis Culture Shock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The women among the 50,000 American soldiers in Saudi Arabia are
likely to be a disturbing if not threatening presence in a culture
where women cannot drive, vote, sit in a theater with a man or even
show their face and hair.
   The Saudi kingdom has the most conservative and rigid Islamic
way of life of all the Arab countries. Most Westerners there are
employees of Western companies who are kept isolated from the rest
of the country.
   U.S. women soldiers said Wednesday that Saudi men react with
dismay and occasional hostility when they see them doing such
non-combat jobs as repairing airplanes and driving trucks or, in at
least one case, giving orders to men.
   ``I don't think they disagree with what we're doing,'' said a
Victoria, Va., sergeant, whose name was withheld in keeping with
the media ground rules. ``I think they're more like shocked:
`There's an American woman. She's doing what men are doing.' ''
   The U.S. troops may pose a significant outside influence that
may be hard to control.
   ``It's a breaking of the hermetic seal that's surrounded Saudi
Arabia since it was founded in the 1920s,'' said Richard Bulliet, a
professor of Middle Eastern studies at Columbia University. ``What
happens to the Saudi foot soldier whose world view of women is
quasi-human, when he sees a woman making an arrest?''
   The U.S. buildup includes women truck drivers, communications
specialists, technicians and aircraft crew chiefs. The Pentagon
would not give specific numbers.
   Some experts warned against allowing American troops much access
to the average Saudi, who lives in a culture where one recent topic
of conversation was whether beheadings should be televised. (So
far, they have not been.)
   ``It would be a big mistake if our soldiers were allowed to mix
too much,'' said Lenore Martin, a fellow at Harvard University's
Center for Middle Eastern Studies.
   ``We really have to see our forces separate because the
stability of the government is involved. One of the main reasons
the Saudis haven't given us bases before is the fear of being too
closely Westernized in order to protect the fundamentalist regime
and way of life.''
   Though Saudi men cannot drink alcohol and must adhere to a rigid
dress code, among other regulations, it is Saudi women who live an
especially restricted life.
   When women go outside, their clothing must cover almost all of
their bodies and faces. Women must use separate beaches and
theaters. They are allowed an education but can attend only
segregated classes. Saudi wives cannot ask for divorces and are
strictly limited in their right to own property.
   ``American troops are totally incompatible with the way of life
in Saudi Arabia,'' said Bulliet. ``I have no idea who's going to
get disgusted first _ the Americans with Saudi behavior or the
Saudis with the Americans.''
   The Virginia sergeant, an F-15 fighter ground crew chief, said
that Saudi men stop work and stare when she tells crewmen what to
do. She said that Saudi men reacted so strongly when another ground
crew woman peeled off her shirt to work in a T-shirt underneath
that a U.S. sergeant told her to put it back on.
   ``They got very emotional about that,'' the sergeant said.
``They made a lot of physical movements. I think they asked the
sergeant to make her put her shirt back on.''
   American troops were briefed on Saudi culture in one of several
booklets distributed before shipping out.
   ``You will seldom see women outside the home,'' reads one. ``It
is considered impolite to inquire about a man's wife or his female
children. Men should not show any interest in Arab women. Do not
photograph or stare at them. Arab women barely touch upon greeting
a man and they shake hands using fingertips only.''
   But the Saudis' knowledge of the Western way of life may be less
detailed. The information they glean from Saudi television, where
prayers are broadcast five times daily along with readings from the
Koran, is not likely to prepare them.
   ``The fact that there are women in the U.S. military will be
regarded as a very unusual and perhaps disgraceful thing by the
clergy in Saudi Arabia,'' said Gary Sick, a Middle Eastern
specialist at Columbia and a member of the National Security
Council during the Carter administration.
   But he added: ``People do what they need to do for survival. It
would be a mistake to assume that because they're breaking their
own rules in a crisis like this, the Saudis won't revert to old
ways once the crisis is over.''
   Indeed, some experts on Islamic law and culture said the role of
women may appear more restricted than it is.
   ``While women don't have many of privileges and liberties, in
the internal dynamics of Saudi families women have to be very much
the boss,'' said Roy Muttahedah, a professor at Harvard's Center
for Middle Eastern Studies. ``It leads to a lot of de facto
matriarchies.''

<DATELINE>AQABA, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi trucks packed with goods are rolling
overland from this Red Sea port toward Baghdad along what is
believed to be the only major bypass of the international naval net
surrounding Iraq.
   ``They appear to be in a hurry to get as much Iraq-bound cargo
to that destination before the sanction loophole at Aqaba is
closed,'' said one official on condition of anonymity.
   The vehicles carried distinctive yellow Iraqi registration
plates as they rolled along the desert highways Wednesday toward
Baghdad.
   Many others with Jordanian license tags loaded cargo from seven
ships docked at Aqaba, the kingdom's only Red Sea outlet, and
headed for Amman. There was no way of telling how many were bound
for the Iraqi border, about 370 miles northwest.
   Reporters were not allowed to enter Aqaba port, where hundreds
of trucks crowded parking lots waiting to be loaded. Officials at
the facility said the cargo came from ships and warehouses at the
facility.
   President Bush has threatened to block the port of Aqaba to
Iraqi trade if Iraq continues getting supplies from Jordan. Bush is
to meet today in Maine with King Hussein.
   The U.N. Security Council ordered sanctions on Iraq after
Baghdad announced the annexation of neighboring Kuwait on Aug 8. It
invaded six days earlier, touching off an international outcry.
   Thousands of U.S. and other Western and pro-Western Arab forces
have since converged on Saudi Arabia to face off with the Iraqis.
Scores of warships also deployed in the oil-rich Persian Gulf to
intercept Iraq-bound products, and Saudi Arabia and Turkey halted
Iraqi oil shipments through pipelines passing across their
territories.
   Jordanian and Iraqi truck drivers, waiting their turn for
loading, complained about the U.S. stand.
   ``Why is America against (Iraq's Saddam Hussein) when it refuses
to do anything against Israel for occupying Palestine?'' one Iraqi
driver said angrily.
   More than 100 trucks rolled out of Aqaba in just one hour
Wednesday morning. About 10 were Iraqi, including tractor-trailers,
refrigeration trucks that normally transport food, and open-deck
trucks carrying iron bars.
   Nine Iraqi oil tankers were heading overland southward from
Amman, and seven rolled in the opposite direction. It was not known
how many were carrying cargo and if any was for export.
   Port officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there
was nothing unusual about that. They noted that Iraq pumps small
quantities of oil through a pipeline to a desert facility near
Amman. Tankers distribute some of the oil for use locally, and the
rest is shipped out through Aqaba.
   While the exact capacity of the pipeline is not known, officials
have said $50 million of oil were exported last year through that
link to Brazil.
   Jordan, Iraq's main Arab ally, has not committed itself to the
embargo.
   It was Iraq's staunchest ally during the eight-year Iran-Iraq
war, when convoys of trucks from Aqaba ferried weapons, raw
material and foodstuffs to Iraq. King Hussein is said to be a
friend of President Saddam.
   In addition, pro-Iraqi feeling runs strong in Jordan, both among
Palestinians who see Saddam as their hope for regaining their lost
home in Israeli-occupied lands and among nationalists and Islamic
fundamentalists who resent Western military intervention.
Anti-American demonstrations have flared nationwide during the
crisis.

<HEAD>American Family Out For Burgers, Drug Suspect Kills Mother,
Daughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American family's night out for
burgers ended in the deaths of the mother and daughter when a
suspected drug dealer commandeered their car and was captured in a
shootout with police.
   The mother, Kimberley Hinkson, was 4{ months pregnant with
twins, her cousin, Dennis Hansen, reported in Provo, Utah. Also
killed in the Tuesday night shootout was her daughter, Courtney,
10, one of the six Hinkson children, he said. The father was
wounded in the head.
   Both mother and daughter apparently were killed by the gunman,
said Adam Shub, a State Department press officer in Washington. But
a U.S. Embassy statement in Riyadh said only that the two were
killed during the shootout.
   Kent Hinkson and his family, who moved to Saudi Arabia from
Orange County, Calif., eight years ago, had planned to move back to
the United States at the end of the month and settle in Provo,
relatives said.
   The cousin said Hinkson had attended Brigham Young University in
Provo and was working for the Saudi government as a computer
programmer.
   Hansen said the Hinksons and four of their children were out for
hamburgers when a man being pursued by police jumped in their car
and shot the daughter in the throat, killing her.
   During the chase that followed, Mrs. Hinkson was shot to death
and Kent Hinkson was wounded in the scalp, Hansen said.
   The car passed through several roadblocks, with the gunman and
police exchanging shots before the pursuit ended, the embassy said.
   ``The suspect has been apprehended and is in Saudi police
custody,'' it added.
   Under the kingdom's Islamic laws, the penalty for murder is
death. The death sentence is carried out by beheading, and Hansen
said the man in custody is scheduled to be decapitated Saturday.
   Hansen said the Hinksons were members of the Mormon Church. He
said their two other children were at home when the shooting
occurred.
   He said Mrs. Hinkson and Courtney will be buried in Midvale, a
Salt Lake City suburb.
   The State Department said the shootings had nothing to do with
Operation Desert Shield, the U.S. operation designed to roll back
Iraq's annexation of Kuwait.

   Mel Gibson, star of such violence-studded films
as ``The Road Warrior'' and ``Lethal Weapon,'' is choosy about what
he lets his six children see.
   ``I think there is a level of violence in films that's
unacceptable,'' he said. ``I don't think there's anything like that
in `Lethal Weapon.' It's not pornographic violence. I've seen films
where it was too much.''
   But Gibson said he would not let his children watch ``The Road
Warrior,'' which is set in a violent, post-apocalyptic world.
   ``It is such a fantastic movie and some people come to some
pretty bad ends there,'' Gibson said in the Sept. 3 issue of US
magazine. ``But to me it's not serious, it's almost comic.''
   Gibson has just finishing playing the title role in a film
production of ``Hamlet,'' directed by Franco Zeffirelli.
   ``Why shouldn't I do it? It was like someone drawing a line on
the ground and daring me to step over that line,'' he said.

   M.C. Hammer, whose ``Please Hammer Don't Hurt
'Em'' is the biggest-selling rap album ever, is taking the rap from
former employees.
   ``It was like modern-day slavery,'' Kent Wilson, Hammer's former
turntable wizard, a.k.a. Lone Mixer, told Rolling Stone magazine in
its Sept. 6 issue.
   ``He wanted to have total control over everybody at all times,''
said Dontay Newman, a bodyguard who quit last year.
   The magazine said nearly all 70 of Hammer's entourage of
singers, dancers, bodyguards and others must return directly to
their hotel rooms after each show and stay there all night or get a
$100 fine.
   Penalties also have been meted out for missing dance steps
onstage and failing to have luggage ready on travel days, the
magazine said.
   Hammer said the entourage has a curfew to keep its members out
of trouble.
   ``We don't put curfews on you to control your life _ just
curfews that kind of help save your life,'' he said. ``Everybody is
not 25 or 30 years old here. We've got 18-year-olds, 19-year-olds,
who we feel very responsible for.''
   ``Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em'' has sold more than 5 million
copies and features the single ``U Can't Touch This.''

   A judge said he will lop $1.1 million off the
$4.2 million awarded Las Vegas showman Bobby Berosini in his
lawsuit against animal rights activists.
   A jury Saturday awarded Berosini damages for defamation and
invasion of privacy against two groups and three individuals
accused of releasing secretly made videotapes of Berosini striking
orangutans used in his act.
   District Judge Myron Leavitt said that although the jury could
return damages for defamation and holding a person in a ``false
light,'' Berosini can collect on only one of those claims under
Nevada law.
   He said the damages assessed against the Washington-based People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals will be reduced from $2
million to $1.5 million. The other awards will be reduced by a
total of $600,000.
   Defense attorneys have said they will appeal the verdict.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   The dollar closed slightly higher against the yen
Thursday, while prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell sharply.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 562.68 points, or 2
percent, to close at 27,549.76 points. Volume was 300 million
shares.
   The dollar closed at 147.90, up 0.05 yen from Wednesday's
147.85-yen finish. The currency opened at 147.25 yen, down 0.60 yen
from the previous day, and traded in the 148.20-147.15 yen range.
   On the bond market, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
government bonds ended higher at 7.985 percent, compared to the
Wednesday yield of 7.905 percent. Their price was 83.52, down from
the previous day's 83.86.
   Traders attributed the Nikkei's decline to profit taking and
continuing uncertainties in the Middle East.
   The index rose 1,439.59 points, or 5.40 percent, closing at
28,112.12 Wednesday. It was the third largest single-day gain in
the market's main indicator.
   The dollar, which continued to slip following its decline in New
York to 147.65 yen, was bound to get weaker against the yen here,
said Masato Hayashi, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   He said, however, that the dollar-yen rate was not moving as
much as Wednesday because some investors who had oversold the
dollar the previous day were buying the U.S. currency.
   ``Also, because market players are still uncertain about what is
going to come out of the Jordan-U.S. talks, they don't want to sell
the dollar too quickly,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report: All Hostages To Be Freed By The End Of 1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leftist Beirut newspaper As-Safir
today said that all 14 Western hostages held in Lebanon, including
six Americans, will be freed by the end of the year.
   In a front-page report, the respected newspaper quoted well
informed diplomatic sources as saying ``secret contacts ...
involving the concerned capitals, particularly Tehran,'' were under
way to resolve the issue.
   Most of the captives are believed held by Shiite Moslem
extremists operating under the umbrella of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The report quoted the unnamed sources as saying they ``expect
positive developments in the coming few days related to the fate of
the Western hostages held in Lebanon.''
   ``The issue of the hostages, as a result of the developments in
the Gulf region, has been put on a very hot burner,'' they said.
   The hostage-takers have made various demands for the release of
prisoners held by Israel in southern Lebanon, and convicted
terrorists jailed in Kuwait and Western capitals.
   Israel has refused to free hundreds of inmates held on suspicion
of involvement in attacks against Israeli troops in southern
Lebanon.
   Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, there has been no
firm word on the fate of 15 Shiite prisoners whose release was
demanded by kidnappers in return for American hostages.
   Most of the convicts were serving long prison terms and three
were awaiting execution for involvement in a 1983 bombing spree
against the U.S. and French embassies and Kuwaiti installations.
   Some reports said the prisoners have escaped after the Iraqis
invaded Kuwait, others said that they have been killed and some
suggested that they have been moved to Baghdad, the Iraqi capital.
   As-Safir said the release of Swiss Red Cross orthopedic
technician, Elio Erriquez, on Monday was part of the deal being
worked out for an end to the issue.
   It said: ``Other phases are to follow until the whole issue is
closed by the end of this year,'' the report added.
   Erriquez and a friend, Emanuel Christen, also a Swiss orthopeic
expert, were kidnapped in south Lebanon in October.
   Christen was released last week.
   The conservative newspaper Al-Anwar has reported that a ransom
of $5.5 million was paid for their release, but the report could
not be independently confirmed. Officials in Switzerland have
denied any deal was made.
   In addition to the Americans, the Western hostages are four
Britons, two West Germans, an Italian and an Irishman.
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is the longest held foreign captive. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>AIDS Patient's Death After Blood Heating Rekindles Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS patients are clamoring for more information
about an unproven heat treatment following the death two weeks ago
of an American who had gone to a Mexican clinic for the therapy.
   The treatment, in which a patient's blood is removed, heated and
put back in a continuous process, was widely publicized in June.
Dr. Kenneth Alonso in Atlanta, who devised the treatment called
hyperthermia, had reported it eliminated signs of the AIDS virus in
a man with Kaposi's sarcoma, a deadly skin cancer common in AIDS
patients.
   Details of Alonso's findings have not yet been published in a
scientific journal, but a team from the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases went to Atlanta on July 25 at his
invitation to review his findings.
   Dr. Gabriel Torres, medical information consultant for the Gay
Men's Health Crisis, a patient advocacy group in New York, urged
the institute to release its report of that visit.
   ``The majority of physicians who take care of AIDS patients have
been overwhelmed by questions from the patients about
hyperthermia,'' he said Wednesday. ``And we don't have any
information.''
   Mary Jane Walker, a spokeswoman for the institute, said the
report will be completed by the middle of next week and a statement
will be released immediately afterward. Alonso said a report of his
findings will appear shortly in the journal Molecular Oncology and
Tumor Pharmacotherapy.
   Hyperthermia is used to treat some forms of cancer. Some doctors
say it might turn out to be useful in the treatment of AIDS or
AIDS-related cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma, but they say the
treatment cannot yet be evaluated.
   The report by the government team could help end the confusion,
Torres said.
   If the findings look promising, ``then the next step would be to
try to reproduce the results elsewhere,'' he said. If the findings
aren't encouraging, ``we should not invest taxpayers' dollars in
the research,'' he said.
   In a survey of 300 AIDS doctors, 90 percent said they had been
asked by patients about hyperthermia, Torres said.
   The patient who died is one of only three AIDS patients with
Kaposi's sarcoma have received the hyperthermia treatment.
   The first, treated in February, shows no signs of Kaposi's
sarcoma or of the AIDS virus six months later, Alonso said. The
second, treated in mid-June, has had a 50 percent regression of
Kaposi's sarcoma tumors in his lungs and reduced levels of the AIDS
virus, Alonso said. They were treated in Atlanta.
   The third was the patient who died in Mexico. He was treated
Aug. 1.
   ``The patient died the next day, hours later,'' said Alonso.
``Apparently he had a cardiac rhythm disturbance and developed
pulmonary edema,'' a build-up of fluid in the lungs.
   Alonso said the patient didn't die because of the treatment but
because his disease was much more severe than doctors thought.
   Alonso said the procedure was done in Mexico because his
hospital, Atlanta Hospital, was having difficulties with Georgia
regulatory officials and because Mexican doctors had invited him to
train them in the procedure.
   Dr. Bernard Bihari of New York, the patient's doctor, was
critical of Alonso's handling of the case. Bihari treats AIDS
patients and is executive director of the Community Research
Initiative, an organization that conducts trials of experimental
AIDS treatments.
   Bihari said that he had advised chemotherapy but that the
patient sought hyperthermia against his advice after learning about
it from news reports. He said chemotherapy could probably have kept
the patient alive for two years.
   ``I think he died because of media hype,'' Bihari said. ``He'd
be alive and stable now with conservative treatment.''
   However, Alonso said he had advised the patient against
hyperthermia but that Bihari had insisted that the patient receive
it.

<HEAD>Iraqi Foreign Minister Says Detained Americans Won't Be Hurt</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's foreign minister promised that Americans
detained in Baghdad and Kuwait would not be harmed. He also said he
would investigate the case of an American couple with a baby in
need of medical care.
   The minister, Tariq Aziz, made his remarks in Baghdad in an
interview with Ted Koppel of ABC's ``Nightline.'' The segment aired
Wednesday.
   Aziz was asked why foreigners, including thousands of Americans,
have been detained in Baghdad and Kuwait since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   ``This measure is a temporary precautionary measure,'' he said.
``I cannot elaborate on that at the moment. We might say more in
the near future about it, but I pledge that they will be safe and
no harm will effect them.''
   Aziz noted that 10-year-old Penelope Nabokov of Albany, Calif.,
had been permitted to leave, and he hinted at special treatment for
other such ``humanitarian cases.''
   Koppel asked if he would guarantee safe passage for an American
couple in Baghdad with a 6-year-old daughter and 6-month-old boy in
need of medical care for a hernia. Aziz promised to ask his
government to look into their case.
   Koppel did not give the couple's name. But Peggy Heath of
Farmington Hills, Mich., said they were her brother and
sister-in-law, Dawn and Kevin Bazner, originally from Northville,
Mich., and the Bazner's children, Elizabeth and David.
   ``They are the only American children in that hotel,'' Heath
said.
   She said her brother is a vice president for A&amp;W Restaurants
International and that his plane was stranded in Iraq en route to
Malaysia, where he and his wife live.
   Koppel said that he had found Americans detained in a Baghdad
hotel physically well and well-treated. He said they spend their
time jogging in the halls, listening to the BBC, using the pool,
reading and eating.
   Aziz also said that Iraq is ready to negotiate with the United
States and would neither start a war with America nor invade Saudi
Arabia.
   The United States is blockading Iraq and has sent in troops to
protect Saudi Arabia since Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait.
   ``It's up to the American government,'' Aziz said. ``If they
have come to initiate a war here, I think they will be sorry for
that, because they will lose that war.''
   He complained that high-level American officials imposed
unacceptable conditions for starting talks.
   ``They said no,'' Aziz said. ``No dialogue with the Iraqi
government, unless the Iraqi government does one, two, three, four.
This is unacceptable. ... If they want to talk to us in a
civilized, respectable manner, we are ready.''
   He said the invasion of Kuwait was justified because the emirate
on the Persian Gulf was part of Iraq until 1913, ``when the British
deliberately cut off this part of Iraq, imposed a phony regime of a
handful of corrupt sheiks on it and created a separate entity. ...
The kingdom of Iraq did not recognize Kuwait as a separate entity
from Iraq.''
   Asked why that action justifies an invasion more than 70 years
later, Aziz replied that Kuwait was conspiring with the United
States to destabilize and impoverish Iraq through oil production
policies.
   He complained that Kuwait didn't respect its OPEC oil-production
quota.
   ``They flooded the market with a glut of oil. They brought down
the prices from $18 a barrel to almost $11 a barrel. And that is a
conspiracy! That's a war,'' Aziz said. ``War can be done by arms,
war can be done by economy.''

<HEAD>At Least 3,300 Killed in Ethnic War Since June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's ethnic war has claimed
3,350 lives since fighting resumed in June, making it the deadliest
phase in the 7-year-old civil war, according to officials and a
classified military document.
   The officials, who spoke today on condition of anonymity, said
at least 2,000 civilians died in the fighting that pits Tamil
separatists against the Sinhalese-dominated government.
   The war has driven at least 500,000 people from their homes into
government relief camps.
   The classified document, made available to The Associated Press,
said at least 566 members of the security forces died in clashes
with Tamil guerrillas. At least 461 others were missed and presumed
dead.
   Tamil separatists, seeking an independent nation, resumed
fighting the Sinhalese-dominated government June 11, breaking a
13-month cease-fire.
   Tamil militants say they are discriminated against by the
majority Sinhalese. Tamils, who are mainly Hindu, make up 18
percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, while the mainly Buddhist
Sinhalese comprise 75 percent.
   Before the war resumed in June, a total of 13,000 people had
died in the civil strife, which began in 1983.
   The government's count of Tamil guerrillas killed in the latest
phase of violence was 785. But Defense Secretary Cyril Ranatunge
said earlier he believed many more were killed.
   ``That's (785 dead) the official toll, but we believe the rebels
have lost at least 2,000 fighters,'' Gen. Ranatunge said.
   Government officials said at least 2,000 civilians died in the
fighting since June in clashes between ethnic groups, in aerial
attacks and those caught in the cross-fire.
   Most of the casulties occurred in the north and the east,
strongholds of the Tamil rebels. Most of the victims were either
Tamils and Moslems.
   Moslems, who make up 7 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
claim neutrality in the war, but Tamil rebels accuse them of siding
with the government.
   On Saturday, Tamil guerrillas massacred Moslem men, women and
children in five fishing villages. Government officials originally
said 173 people died, but later reduced the count to 127.
   On Aug. 3, Tamil gunmen raided another eastern village and
massacred 140 Moslems in two mosques, setting off a chain of
revenge killings.

<HEAD>Study Finds Some Food Allergy Tests Are Worthless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study today concludes that allergy testing in
which specialists inject people with food extracts and watch for
unpleasant symptoms is worthless.
   People respond to dummy shots just as frequently as they do to
extracts of chocolate, potato, wheat and other food, the study
found.
   ``Our study shows that this kind of testing is not valid,'' said
Dr. Don L. Jewett. ``It does not really tell you what people are
bothered by.''
   Jewett, a surgeon at the University of California at San
Francisco, directed the study, which was performed by seven
practitioners of environmental medicine.
   The practice of injecting people with food extracts is a
mainstay of environmental medicine. Doctors in this field attribute
a wide variety of ailments to adverse reactions to foods, chemicals
and pollution.
   Dr. Sherry Rogers of Syracuse, N.Y., a member of the American
Academy of Environmental Medicine, said she thought the study was
flawed because doctors gave the wrong doses in their injections.
   ``I'm flabbergasted,'' she said. ``It's full of errors. It's a
gross misunderstanding of the entire technique.''
   Mainstream allergists test for allergic sensitivities with a
scratch test. Typically, they drop a bit of the suspected
allergy-causing substance on the broken skin and look for a rash.
   By contrast, those in environmental medicine inject the food
into the skin and then wait to see if the patient feels ill.
Possible symptoms include itching nose, watering eyes, plugged
ears, scratchy throat, tiredness, headache, nausea, dizziness,
difficulty breathing, sleepiness, depression, chills, coughing, jaw
tightening, nervousness, tension, intestinal gas and aching legs.
   If a substance triggers a response, the doctor may then try to
find a so-called ``neutralizing dose'' of the same food extract.
Then the patient receives a series of these neutralizing shots.
   Jewett said his study questions the value of the treatment as
well as the accuracy of the diagnostic test.
   ``These are not charlatans,'' he said. ``The doctors think they
have an answer and are trying their honest best. Unfortunately,
they are misguided.''
   His study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, was
performed on 18 patients during 20 sessions. Patients received
either dummy shots of salt water or real food extracts. Neither
they nor the doctors knew what was being given.
   The patients felt symptoms following 27 percent of the active
injections and 24 percent of the dummy shots.
   Jewett undertook the study after having the treatment himself
and believing that it helped him. ``I thought for sure it would
show up that these shots worked,'' he said. ``It was a big shock to
me to find that they didn't.''

<HEAD>Tensions Cool At Mohawk Standoff Site; Ojibwas Block Railroad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>

   Tensions cooled at a suburban bridge blocked by
Mohawks before talks aimed at ending a dispute over what the
Indians claim is ancestral land.
   In another dispute, scores of Ojibwa Indians camped out on a
railroad that runs through their reserve in northern Ontario,
stranding hundreds of travelers, railroad officials said.
   Provincial, federal and Mohawk representatives were scheduled
today to resume negotiations that were stalled for a month. They
arranged to meet at a hotel in Dorval on the west island of
Montreal.
   No violence was reported Wednesday night at Mercier Bridge in
Chateauguay, a suburb south of Montreal on the edge of the
Kahnawake reserve. The Mohawk blockade of the bridge _ the suburb's
main artery to Montreal _ had caused violent clashes in recent days
between residents and police.
   The bridge blockade was mounted by the Indians five weeks ago in
sympathy with fellow Mohawks in the land dispute at Oka, 18 miles
west of Montreal, where the Indians say a planned golf course
addition would encroach on ancestral land.
   Police and natives have faced each other across barricades at
Oka since July 11, when a botched police raid on a Mohawk roadblock
claimed the life of a police officer. Officials were unable to
determine whose gunfire killed the man.
   On Wednesday, jeeps, armored personnel carriers and trucks
carrying about 2,600 soldiers of the 5th Canadian Mechanized
Brigade rolled into communities outside of Montreal. The troops
moved from their base at Valcartier, near Quebec City, at the
request of Premier Robert Bourassa.
   Eight observers attached to the Internation Federation of Human
Rights stationed themselves at Oka and Kahnawake.
   In Winnipeg, there was loud applause among 300 delegates to a
summit of native leaders when Peguis Chief Louis Stevenson said,
``If there is an attack against the Mohawks, it would be an attack
on all of us.'' Stevenson said if the Mohawks are attacked, natives
across Canada should consider retaliating by destroying power,
water and gas lines.
   In Longlac, Ontario, Ojibwas blocked a rail line on Wednesday,
forcing Via Rail to halt passenger service in the region, railway
officials said.
   The blockade stranded several hundred travelers overnight in
Winnipeg and White River, about 120 miles north of Sault Ste.
Marie, said railway spokesman Mike Williams.
   The railway said the natives had blocked the tracks near White
River.
   Chief Sidney Abraham said in an interview Wednesday that his
group was never fully consulted or compensated for construction of
the railway or the highway, both of which cut through the Long Lake
reserve.
   In separate action, members of another Ojibwa group near Longlac
have been blocking rail lines since Monday. They set up lawn chairs
and tents to block two rail lines, with up to 150 people camping
out at the blockade at a time.
   The reasons for the blockade were not immediately clear.
   ``We won't operate any trains until the blockades are completely
gone,'' Williams said Wednesday night, adding the company has
halted passenger service between Toronto and Winnipeg.
   About 187 passengers on a westbound train from Toronto to
Winnipeg were spending the night in White River because of the
blockade, Via spokesman Paul Raynor said.
   Those passengers were spending the night aboard their train,
which is equipped with sleeper cars, he said. They were to be bused
to Thunder Bay, 180 miles to the south, and flown to Winnipeg.

<HEAD>Firefighters Get Upper Hand on Several Major Wildfires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Firefighters have nearly
contained the blazes that closed Yosemite Park for the first time
in its 100-year history, and its most popular section could be open
by Monday, officials say.
   The firest have burned about 34 square miles of the park over
the past week.
   Overall in California, about 1,300 wildfires have burned more
than 400 square miles since Aug. 3. Hundreds of forest and range
fires also burned in Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana,
Oregon and Washington state.
   Three big fires that closed the park to visitors Aug. 9 should
be contained by Friday night, officials said. They said a highway
through the park will reopen Friday, but the popular Yosemite
Valley won't open until after the weekend.
   ``The reason for the closure until Monday is we have fires,
burning snags and falling rocks,'' said Janet Buzzini, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service.
   In Yosemite, the largest fire has burned 17,000 acres on the
park's western border. It was about 80 percent contained and was
expected to be fully contained by Friday, said Dwayne Collier of
the state Forestry Department.
   A second fire across the Merced River that has burned 4,400
acres was 60 percent contained today and should be fully contained
this evening, he said. The third fire was contained at 4,700 acres
on Wednesday, Collier said.
   Other small fires also burned in the 757,000-acre park, but
there were no fires on the valley floor where tourists congregate.
   In Foresta, a vacation village near Yosemite, fire destroyed 66
homes earlier this week.
   For the third day in a row, fire officials gave highest priority
to a fire in Northern California's Tehama County that burned nearly
22,000 acres and was 70 percent contained. The fire earlier this
week threatened some 1,600 homes.
   As in Yellowstone National Park, where fires swept through
nearly half of its 2.2 million acres in the virtually rain-free
summer of 1988, Yosemite has a policy of letting lightning-struck
fires burn in some areas.
   But the fires this summer are in areas where blazes are fought
automatically because of their proximity to roads or buildings,
said Sue Fritzke, a Yosemite fire official.
   Officials at both parks blamed the intensity of the fires on 100
years of unenlightened management. By not allowing small fires to
sweep out dead wood and underbrush, managers set the stage for
huge, destructive fires, they said.
   That practice changed in the early 1970s, but there is still a
buildup of downed wood and underbrush left over from earlier days,
officials said.

   By letting a community college train air
traffic controllers, the Federal Aviation Administration reckons it
won't have to play the bad guy quite so often.
   The agency said Wednesday it has agreed to hire 14 graduates a
year from Beaver County Community College. It will be the first
school apart from the FAA's academy in Oklahoma City to train
controllers for the nation's airports.
   About 1,200 candidates each year take rigorous three-month
courses at the FAA academy, and half of them fail and lose their
government jobs, said Herbert McLure, FAA human resources director.
   The program at the college in Monaca, about 30 miles from
Pittsburgh, will allow unsuccessful candidates to change their
fields of study without the stigma of failure, McLure said.
   ``We'd like to have a more humane way of terminating people,''
he said. ``Our business is in air traffic control. We're not
professionals in the training field.''
   The project could save the government $45,000 per controller,
FAA officials said. Each controller trained by the FAA academy is
on the government payroll during training, and the agency also
picks up their housing and transportation costs.
   At the community college, the students pay.
   ``The system we have now pits the employer against the
employee,'' William Pollard, FAA associate administrator for air
traffic. ``The first words we tell them should not be, `Fifty
percent of you are not going to make it,' as they are now.''
   The school already operates the tower at the Beaver County
Airport, the only tower in the nation run by a college, FAA
officials said.
   Graduates now can be placed at medium-sized airports such as
those in Erie, Youngstown, Ohio, or Des Moines, Iowa, then must
pass the FAA's on-the-job tests before they are certified.
   The starting salary for an air traffic controller is $23,000.
   The FAA has struggled to fill controllers' posts since 1981,
when President Reagan fired 11,000 union controllers who illegally
walked off the job.
   The FAA academy ``is not attracting the right types of
individuals at this point,'' said Tony Dresden, a spokesman for the
National Air Traffic Controllers Association in Washington. ``After
the 1981 strike, they threw an enormous net out to fill those
posts.''
   If the Beaver County program works, other U.S. colleges could
offer FAA-approved courses in air traffic control, McLure said.

<HEAD>Russia, Lithuania Sign Economic Cooperation Treaty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuania and the Soviet Union's largest republic
have signed a trade and economic cooperation treaty that bypasses
the central government, the official Tass news agency reported
today.
   The treaty signed Wednesday between Lithuania and the Russian
republic is the first of its kind between two Soviet republics. It
is the result of Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin's offer last
month to negotiate a range of political, economic and social
treaties with other republics.
   The treaty was signed in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius by
the republic's prime minister, Kazimiera Prunskiene, and Russian
Prime Minister Ivan Silayev, Tass said.
   The independent news agency Postfactum said prices of goods to
be traded between the two republics will initially be negotiated by
the buyers and sellers but will gradually move to world prices.
   Under the Soviet Union's command economy, all resources and
products now are simply handed over to the central government at
prices set by Soviet bureaucrats. They then redistribute everything
around the country.
   Tass said issues standing in the way of even closer economic
cooperation between Lithuania and Russia include the legal question
of who owns natural resources in the huge Russian territory.
   Lithuania wants to import natural resources and raw materials
for its industries, including oil and natural gas. The central
government cut off oil and gas supplies and imposed an economic
blockade against Lithuania after its March 11 independence
declarations.
   The sanctions were not lifted until after Lithuania said June 29
that it would freeze its declaration in return for a resumption of
energy and other supplies and the start of sovereignty negotiations
with the Kremlin.
   Russia has claimed ownership of its natural resources, now
controlled by the Kremlin, and Yeltsin last week declared invalid
any contracts to sell Russian resources without the republic's
permission.

<TEXT>
   The chief of the government
commission assigned to recover funds allegedly stolen by the ousted
president Ferdinand Marcos has resigned, presidential spokesman
Adolf Azcuna said today.
   Mateo Caparas, commissioner of the Presidential Commission on
Good Government, quit Tuesday because of personal reasons, Azcuna
said.
   The commission was formed by President Corazon Aquino's
government in 1986 after Marcos fled to the United States following
the ``People Power'' revolt. Mrs. Aquino's government claims Marcos
stole up to $10 billion during his 20 years in office.
   Acceptance of Caparas' resignation will be announced after Mrs.
Aquino appoints his replacement, Azcuna said. Commissioner David
Castro is to take his place temporarily beginning September, Azcuna
said.
   Caparas said in his letter to Mrs. Aquino that he resigned
because he wanted to serve as an official of Rotary International,
Azcuna said.
   Caparas, who was appointed in August 1988, is the fourth
official to head the commission. He succeeded Azcuna, who served
briefly after Ramon Diaz quit in June 1988 amid allegations of
corruption.
   Jovito Salonga, now Senate president, was the first commissioner
but resigned when he ran in the May 1987 congressional elections.
   In New York, a commission statement said the Philippine
government will raise earthquake relief money by selling an
estimated $10 million worth of Old Master paintings and a 100-piece
silver service acquired while Marcos was president. The sale is
planned for January.
   ``We appreciate fine art and we wish we could afford the luxury
of keeping these art pieces for ourselves,'' Caparas said in a
statement released Wednesday by Christie's, the auctioneer.
   ``Our people, however, suffer from many needs that the proceeds
from these art works will help assauge,'' he said in the statement.
   The July 16 quake, registering 7.7 on the Richter scale killed
at least 1,600 people and 1,000 others were still missing as of
early this month, officials said. More than 100,000 were left
homeless.
   Dana Micucci, a spokeswoman for Christie's, said it was not
clear who acquired the silver and 70 paintings to be auctioned, or
where they were kept.

   Terry Mulholland of the Philadelphia
Phillies pitched the eighth no-hitter of the baseball season, a
modern-day record.
   Mulholland, 27, faced the minimum of 27 batters in a 6-0 victory
Wednesday night over the San Francisco Giants, his former
teammates. His bid for a perfect game was shattered in the seventh
when a man got on first on a throwing error.
   The game broke the major league record of seven no-hitters set
in 1908 and again in 1917.
   A crowd of more than 32,000 gave Mulholland a standing ovation
as he leaped into the arms of catcher Darren Daulton and the
Phillies poured out of the dugout to congratulate him. The crowd
stood and cheered his every pitch during the last two innings.
   He said it was ``like a ton of bricks fell off my shoulders''
when third baseman Charlie Hayes grabbed the last ball of the game.

   Just days away from retirement, 1st
Sgt. Michael Outler decided to stick with the Army so he could
accompany his unit to Saudi Arabia.
   ``I just couldn't look at myself in the mirror and walk away,''
the 37-year-old Vietnam veteran said Wednesday.
   That doesn't mean he's unafraid. ``You've got to be a fool not
to be scared; everyone is a little scared,'' Outler said.
   His understanding of fear is part of the reason Outler felt he
had to go. He said he wanted to share his combat experience with
younger soldiers in his unit.
   ``The biggest thing you can tell them is just rely on that
expert training they've received,'' he said. ``It's back there in
their heads.''
   Outler is one of several soldiers in the 101st Airborne Division
based at Fort Campbell who either postponed retirement or
re-enlisted because they wanted to accompany the 15,000-strong
division to Saudi Arabia, said Army spokesman Maj. Dan Grigson.
   The number of soldiers who made that decision was not available,
but five of them spoke to reporters at a news conference Wednesday.
   ``Whatever happens over there, we're here to defend our
country,'' said Sgt. 1st Class Larry Hyatt, 40. ``None of us like
war.''
   Asked what his family thought of his decision to re-enlist,
20-year-old Pfc. Michael Ames said, ``It hasn't went over real
well.'' His Army comrades, he said, ``probably would have done the
same thing.''
   Outler said his wife was worried about him, ``but she also
understands.''
   Sgt. 1st Class Ernest Johnson Jr. said he thought it over for
five or 10 minutes before deciding ``I'm going.''
   ``You put fear aside,'' said Johnson, 42, who has 23 years of
service. ``You can't let fear conquer you.''
   Johnson said he believed the 101st, the U.S. military's only air
assault division, is well-prepared for its mission to defend Saudi
Arabia from possible attack by Iraqi troops along its border.
   ``If we have to go to war, I believe America is going to win,''
he said. ``I believe the U.S. soldier is going to do an outstanding
job.''

   In between cleaning weapons and
loading trucks, scores of soldiers at Fort Campbell are doing a
quick march down the aisle.
   Getting to the church on time, with their fiancees in tow, is
proving a fretful business.
   The entire 15,000-strong 101st Airborne Division based at Fort
Campbell is to be sent to the Middle East in stages over the next
seven weeks.
   ``It'll be good while I'm away knowing she's here and knowing
we're together now,'' Pfc. John Englert said before his wedding to
Candy Broadbent on Wednesday.
   The couple had planned to marry Nov. 10. But, said 19-year-old
Englert, ``I wouldn't want to go and have something happen to me
and I'd never married her.''
   Miss Broadbent, fighting back tears throughout the ceremony,
wore a ruffled white wedding dress borrowed from her bridesmaid.
Englert wore a fixed grin and his green dress uniform with a white
tuxedo shirt and black bow tie.
   His 18-year-old bride said she was confident he would return
home safely. ``I'll be planning the honeymoon while he's gone,''
she said.
   By marrying now, she will be better able to keep in contact
because the Army provides wives with information about their
husbands overseas, she said.
   Englert said he doesn't know how soon his unit will be leaving,
except that it will be soon. ``They told us by the end of the month
we'll all be there,'' he said. ``They say we could be gone six
months or a year.''
   The couple were married by the Rev. Mercer McKinney. It was his
12th military ceremony this month.
   ``I guess they're upset, but they don't really show it,''
McKinney said of the newlyweds. ``Their emotions about getting
married overshadow it.''
   The Montgomery County clerk's office issued 21 marriage licenses
Friday, 32 more on Monday and a total of 27 on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
   ``Normally on Friday we might have six or eight. That's our
largest day,'' Chief Deputy Clerk Faye Baldwin said. ``Some days
it's one or two.''
   Ms. Baldwin returned to the office at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday to
marry a soldier who was leaving the base the next morning. The
majority of the licenses have gone to soldiers, she said.

<TEXT>
   Iraq today said it will free 1,000 Iranian
prisoners a day under an initiative aimed at ending conflict with
Iran to focus on the confrontation with the U.S. forces deployed in
the Persian Gulf.
   An air force spokesman, meanwhile, warned Iraq ``cannot
guarantee the safety'' of any foreign pilot who might be shot down
over Iraqi territory. He said such guarantees were impossible
because of ``the rage the Iraqi people and the Arabs harbor for the
aggressive foreign intervention.''
   The warning was broadcast by Baghdad Radio, which did not name
the spokesman.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted a presidential spokesman
as saying Iraq had decided to repatriate 2,000 Iranian prisoners a
day as of Friday.
   But the Red Cross said it did not have the facilities to absorb
such a large number of POWs, ``and that it is ready to handle 1,000
prisoners daily,'' the agency quoted the spokesman as saying.
   It said arrangements were under way so the number may be
increased at a later stage.
   The agency said those held longest will be the first to be
released Friday at the border posts of Kasr-e-Shirin and Khanaqin.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, said preparations to receive the freed inmates have been
completed.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross said today it has
begun interviewing Iranian prisoners, asking them if they wanted to
be repatriated. Martine Haemmerli, spokeswoman for the Swiss-based
organization speaking in Geneva, quoted Iranian authorities as
saying they are prepared to accept the prisoners at the border.
   She said there has been no word yet from the Iranians as to when
the first large group of Iraqi POWs would be repatriated.
   The Red Cross has registered some 50,000 POWs held by Iran and
19,000 by Iraq. But U.N. officials and diplomats in Tehran and
Baghdad maintain that the total number of POWs captured in the
1980-88 war is more than 100,000.
   In his peace offer Wednesday, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
also said that he would begin withdrawing troops Friday from
Iranian territories occupied in the final weeks of the Iran-Iraq
war, halted by a U.N. cease-fire on Aug. 20, 1988.
   Iran has been pressing for a complete exchange of prisoners,
albeit on its own terms, since the U.N.-sponsored truce took effect.
   It welcomed Saddam's offer and is expected to agree to free
Iraqi prisoners.
   In a letter to Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, text of
which was broadcast by the official media Wednesday, Saddam said he
accepted a 1975 border demarcation treaty as a basis for resolving
the border dispute.
   Saddam's abrogation of the treaty was one of the reasons that
pushed the two countries into war in September 1980.
   His refusal to reinstate that accord which gave Iraq and Iran
equal share of the strategic Shatt-al-Arab waterway was a major
obstacle in U.N.-sponsored peace talks launched after the
cease-fire.
   Saddam had insisited on full Iraqi sovereignty over
Shatt-al-Arab, a major Iraqi outlet to the gulf.
   Saddam's message Wednesday did not specify the area from which
his troops will withdraw. Tehran claims Iraq still holds 770 square
miles of its land. The United Nations says the size of the occupied
area is half of that.
   With the exception of Jordan, all the countries neighboring Iraq
have closed their borders due to U.N. sanctions, imposed on Iraq
after its Aug.2 invasion of Iraq.
   A peace treaty with Iran, whose 630-mile border is Iraq's
longest, would remove the threat of warfare on that front.
   It also would allow Saddam to throw the manpower now used along
the border with Iran into the confrontation with the forces
assembled in Saudi Arabia.

   Freedom is closer than ever today for
tens of thousands of soldiers, some only boys, who were taken
prisoner in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war _ and they have another
Persian Gulf conflict to thank for it.
   Some have languished in prisoner-of-war camps since the early
days of the Iran-Iraq war that broke out in September 1980, even
though the fighting stopped two years ago.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, embroiled in a military
confrontation with the United States over his Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, declared Wednesday he will release all Iranian captives.
   Iraq today said it will free 1,000 Iranian prisoners a day,
starting Friday. The official Iraqi News Agency said Iraq had
wanted to repatriate 2,000 Iranian prisoners a day but the Red
Cross did not have the facilities to absorb such a large number of
POWs.
   The Swiss-based International Committee of the Red Cross said
today it has begun processing prisoners for the release and that
Iran said it was ready to accept them at the border.
   The number of releases would be the largest since a cease-fire
halted the fighting on Aug. 20, 1988.
   ``The POW situation cannot be overestimated politically,'' said
Philip Robbins, an analyst at London's Royal Institute for
International Affairs and a Mideast specialist.
   ``Getting these men back will have a big impact in Iraq,
particularly among the families who have been pressing for the
return of their people. It will certainly boost Saddam's position
internally.''
   Saddam's move was part of a package of Iraqi concessions that
dramatically enhanced the prospect of a peace treaty nearly two
years after the cease-fire.
   Saddam was apparently seeking to secure his long eastern border
with Iran while he faces the Americans and their allies mustering
in Saudi Arabia.
   Iran has been pressing for a complete exchange of prisoners,
albeit on its own terms, since the U.N.-sponsored truce took effect.
   It is now expected to agree to free Iraqi prisoners. However,
Red Cross spokeswoman Martine Haemmerli said the humanitarian
organization's Geneva headquarters was still waiting late Wednesday
for word from Tehran.
   The Red Cross, which will oversee the exchange, has registered
about 50,000 POWs held by Iran and more than 19,000 by Iraq.
   But it says it has not been allowed access to all prisoners.
U.N. officials and diplomats in Iran and Iraq have long maintained
that the total number of prisoners is more than 100,000 _ 60,000 to
70,000 in Iran and 30,000 to 50,000 in Iraq.
   If those figures are correct, the exchange will be the biggest
organized by the Red Cross since the Geneva Convention of 1949.
   Since the cease-fire, the POWs on both sides have been
bargaining chips in the peace talks that deadlocked almost as soon
as they began.
   The U.N. Security Council's cease-fire resolution stipulated
that all POWs be freed.
   But Iran refused to free its captives until Iraq withdrew from
Iranian territory captured in the final months of the war.
   Iraq refused to pull back until Iran acknowledged Iraq's
sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, the confluence of the
Euphrates and Tigris Rivers that forms the southern boundary
between the two countries.
   But in a letter to Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani,
broadcast Wednesday by the official Baghdad Radio, Saddam said he
will relinquish occupied territory and abide by a 1975 treaty
splitting control of the Shatt-al-Arab. He had long said that
treaty was invalid.
   Any prisoner exchange, however, is likely to be prolonged by
prisoners who resist repatriation.
   Both sides have accused the other of torturing and brainwashing
POWs.
   In addition, they have said thousands of POWs defected, often
soldiers who surrendered and feared retribution if they returned
home.
   A U.N. report in late 1988 said many Iranian and Iraqi prisoners
fear persecution if they go back and that Iraqi POWs could riot if
attempts were made to repatriate them.
   The problem over prisoners who do not want to be repatriated
will likely complicate and prolong the expected exchange operation.
   The situation is similar to problems encountered in arranging
the voluntary return of prisoners that prolonged the Korean War for
more than a year until April 1953.
   The Soviet Union held thousands of Germans after World War II
ended. The last 9,000 were not released until 1955 after Moscow and
Bonn agreed to restore diplomatic relations.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's Social Democrats today renewed
their threats to leave the struggling government coalition, a day
after four Cabinet ministers were sacked.
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere is facing mounting threats to
his government, which is guiding the country into a merger with
rich West Germany.
   Following the Cabinet shake-up Wednesday, that job got even
harder.
   Wolfgang Thierse, head of the center-left Social Democrats, said
he envisions his party pulling out of the coalition as early as
next week.
   ``I can no longer envision working further with this prime
minister, whose actions are becoming ever more adventurous,''
Thierse said.
   He told West Berlin's radio station SFB he expects the decision
as soon as the party's members of Parliament return from vacation.
   Party officials have threatened to leave de Maiziere's
government several times in recent weeks.
   De Maiziere, whose conservative Christian Democrats dominate the
coalition, has come under severe criticism for allegedly dealing
behind the backs of the Social Democrats in an attempt to speed up
unification.
   The prime minister also is facing a national economic
catastrophe.
   East Germany's deepening economic crisis forced de Maiziere into
ousting the four ministers from his quarrelsome Cabinet.
   De Maiziere announced the dismissals of Finance Minister Walter
Romberg and Agriculture Minister Peter Pollack at a hastily called
news conference on Wednesday evening. Also gone are Economics
Minister Gerhard Pohl and Justice Minister Kurt Wuensche.
   Romberg, a Social Democrat, said members his party planned to
meet today and discuss their future in the coalition.
   Pohl is a Christian Democrat, while the other two are not
aligned with a party.
   In announcing the changes Wednesday, de Maiziere cited
unspecified errors in negotiating the treaty that governs the
economic merger of the two German states. He also said distribution
of funds from West Germany to restructure the East German economy
was proceeding too slowly.
   Wuensche had held legal posts under the former Communist
government, and his ouster had been demanded for months by some
political groups. De Maiziere gave no reason for Wuensche's
resignation but said it was not related to the removal of the other
three ministers.
   The rapid shift from a centrally planned to a free market system
has released shock waves throughout the East German economy. The
two Germanys merged their economies and East Germany introduced the
West German mark as its currency on July 1, a major step in the
unification process.
   Pollack's ouster was announced just hours after angry farmers
pelted him with eggs at a mass rally in downtown East Berlin.
   Nationwide, up to 700,000 farmers took part in two-hour strikes
Wednesday, the East German news agency ADN said.
   The farmers' protest was the biggest show of anger yet in a
sector reeling from the effects of East Germany's economic slide as
it moves to a free market after four decades of socialism.
   De Maiziere said Pollack's dismissal was not related to the
nationwide farm protests. However, he said Pollack had failed to
design a program to restructure the agriculture system.
   The Cabinet posts will not be filled, but will be handled by
lower-ranking government officials until unification with West
Germany, de Maiziere said. That is expected to occur later this
year.
   Experts say up to 4 million of East Germany's 8.8 million
workers could lose their jobs as the nation continues its move
toward a market economy.
   Almost 1 million workers now are either jobless or working
shorter hours at lower pay under a West German-financed program to
keep workers targeted for layoff on the job.

<TEXT>
   China conducted a nuclear weapons test
today, the second this year after a break of nearly two years,
Swedish monitors reported.
   ``This was an unusually strong explosion by Chinese standards,''
said Mats Gustavsson, an official at Sweden's Defense Research
Establishment.
   The agency's Hagfors Observatory picked up signals indicating a
yield of 50-200 kilotons. The observatory said in a statement the
underground bomb was detonated at the Lop Nor test site in Xinjiang
Province.
   China's last previous test was May 26 and its yield was
estimated at less than 40 kilotons. That explosion was the first
since Sept. 29, 1988, when a bomb of less than 10 kilotons was
tested.
   China is the only nuclear nation that makes no announcements
about its tests. Relatively little is known about its nuclear
capabilities.

<HEAD>Dollar Rebounds From Record Low, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rebounded from a record low against the
German mark in calm European trading late this morning.
   Gold prices were weaker in London on profit-taking as traders
awaited news of the diplomatic mission to the United States by King
Hussein of Jordan on the crisis in the Persian Gulf. Prices were
slightly higher in Zurich.
   Dealers said they expected little movement before the release
later today of the U.S. consumer price index for July.
   ``I don't think there's much chance the dollar will rise
further'' unless there are new developments in the gulf, said one
trader in Milan.
   Dealers said the market's attention has shifted to non-dollar
trading. The yen has been weakened by gloomy forecasts for the
Japanese economy following the surge in oil prices. Britain's pound
sterling, which on Wednesday topped $1.90 for the first time since
1982, also retreated but remained well-bid, dealers said.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8924, compared
with $1.9045 late Wednesday.
   The dollar sank to a record closing low of 1.5605 marks in
Europe on Wednesday but bounced higher in New York on a robust
round of profit-taking. In Europe late this morning it was trading
at 1.5657 marks, close to the late New York price.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.05 yen to a closing 147.90 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 147.62 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.5657 West German marks, up from 1.5605
   _1.3065 Swiss francs, up from 1.3005
   _5.2565 French francs, up from 5.2365
   _1.7650 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7579
   _1,151.45 Italian lire, up from 1,145.75
   _1.1446 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1435
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $402.25 a troy ounce, up
from $401.25 bid late Wednesday. But dealers later fixed a lower
recommended price of $399.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $399.25, up from $398.75 late
Wednesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose 97 cents to close at a bid $401.09.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.08 a troy ounce from
Wednesday's $5.12.

   Two Europeans are behind bars today on
charges of trying to smuggle thousands of anti-tank missiles and
other weapons as well as nuclear waste to Iraq, Iran and Libya.
   Claus Fuhler, 33, a German-born ophthalmologist living in
Barcelona, Spain, and Juan Martin Peche-Koesters, 36, a Madrid
businessman, were indicted Wednesday in an undercover investigation
by the Customs Service.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Genzman said no weapons were shipped, and
Customs agent Bonni G. Tischler said there apparently was no
connection between the plot and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The
investigation began about a year ago, she said.
   Fuhler and Peche-Koesters, who were arrested in Orlando on
Monday, were accused of trying to buy such items as 10,000 TOW
missiles, 20,000 artillery shells, artillery-equipped jeeps,
rifles, grenades and mortars, as well as nuclear waste and chemical
garbage.
   Investigators didn't say what possible use the garbage could
have been.
   Genzman would not say who the defendants are alleged to have
represented in the Arab countries.
   The defendants were charged with conspiring to violate an
embargo on arms sales to Iraq, Iran and Libya. Fuhler could get up
to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. Peche-Koesters faces up
to 15 years and a $750,000 fine.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of foreigners, including two
Americans, three Britons and a Frenchman, today fled Iraq and
crossed into Jordan, a senior Jordanian official reported.
   The six were the first Westerners to cross into Jordan since
Saturday when Baghdad was reported to have banned Westerners from
leaving. There are fears that Iraq would not permit the foreigners
to leave until the Persian Gulf crisis is resolved.
   The official, who cannot be named under standing regulations,
would not give the names of the Western evacuees. He said they were
among 4,700 people, mainly Egyptians, who crossed through the
Ruweishid border post, 200 miles northeast of Amman, by noon (5
a.m. EDT).
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said the mission was aware of the
Jordanian official's statement, but did not know anything about the
two Americans who reportedly crossed the border.
   ``These are private citizens and if they do not contact us we
have no way of finding out anything about them,'' the spokesman
Jonathan Owens said.
   The British Embassy also said it had no information about the
Britons.
   Meanwhile, about 100 demonstrators marched four miles across
Amman to deliver a protest to the U.S. Embassy.
   They chanted pro-Iraqi and anti-American slogans outside the
embassy as a five-man delegation delivered the protest addressed to
President Bush.
   It called ``for the immediate withdrawal of American troops from
the region to give the Arab nation a chance to solve its disputes
by dialogue and peaceful means.''
   The protest warned: ``Arab reaction will be strong and
destructive for your interests in the region and the future
Arab-American relationship if you attack Iraq.''
   The demonstrators dispersed peacefully. Scores of Jordanian
police around the embassy did not intervene.
   The demonstration developed a few hours before King Hussein of
Jordan was due to meet with Bush in Maine to discuss a peaceful
settlement of the gulf crisis.
   Jordan, Iraq's main Arab ally, has still not committed itself to
U.N.-mandated sanctions imposed on Iraq after its Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait.
   Bush said this week that he might send warships to Jordan's Red
Sea port at Aqaba to enforce the embargo on Iraq-bound cargo. U.S.
troops are in Saudi Arabia as part of a multinational force to
deter a possible Iraqi attack on the desert kingdom.

   Radicals threw dozens of firebombs at
U.S. army facility today, and 7,000 people attended a dissident
Roman Catholic Mass near the heavily armed border in support of
Korean unification.
   It was the third day in a row that student radicals staged
violent anti-U.S., anti-government demonstrations in support of
unification of the Korean peninsula.
   About 60 radical students threw dozens of firebombs at the U.S.
Army's Corps of Engineers building near central Seoul, yelling ``We
oppose the U.S. and demand unification of the fatherland!''
   Witnesses said the students staged a sit-in on a busy eight-lane
street near the facility for 20 minutes, shouting anti-U.S. and
anti-government slogans before attacking the compound.
   One student was arrested, police said. A U.S. military spokesman
said there no injuries and no significant property damage.
   The door of the army facility was blackened by marks from
exploding firebombs, witnesses said.
   At Freedom Bridge, a border checkpoint, about 7,000 people
prayed for national unification in a two-hour Catholic Mass,
celebrated by 150 priests.
   The Mass, organized by priests critical of the government, had
strong anti-U.S. overtones. A good part of the crowd was radical
students and dissidents.
   After the service, about 200 radical students yelling ``Drive
Out Yankees!'' tried to ram hundreds of riot police blocking the
entrance to Freedom Bridge, the last checkpoint before entering the
border area.
   Police drove students back with clubs, using their shields as
weapons. At least two protesters were injured, one bleeding from
his mouth.
   There were no reports of arrests.
   Radicals and dissidents demand an immediate withdrawal of the
43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense
treaty since 1954. They claim that the U.S. military presence
hinders dialogue with North Korea.
   They carried anti-U.S. pickets and placards. One placard had
skulls drawn on a deformed U.S. flag.
   South Korea proposed the Korean border be opened for the first
time ever for five days this week beginning Monday. The border
opening has not taken place because both sides failed to discuss
details.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the Communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. They fought a bloody three-year war
in the early 1950s. Their border is sealed and there is no mail or
other forms of communciation between them.

<HEAD>Museum Expects Return of Art Treasures from Soviets Soon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A West German museum said today it soon
expects to recover 362 valuable drawings and watercolors taken
during World War II, including works by Duerer, Rubens and van Gogh.
   The works were taken to the Soviet Union after the war _ one of
numerous cases of treasures plundered or spirited away from the
defeated nation.
   Ursula Lichtlein, a spokeswoman for the Kunsthalle Bremen
museum, said officials there expect the 362 art works will be
returned next month or in October.
   She cautioned that ``negotiations are still under way'' with
Moscow, including questions of whether any payment will be involved.
   ``We have organized an exhibition for next year, so that we can
show the returned works to the public,'' Ms. Lichtlein said by
telephone from the northern port city of Bremen.
   The way the Bremen drawings and watercolors reached the Soviet
Union sounds almost like the plot from a suspense novel.
   In 1945, as the Red Army advanced on Germany, a Soviet soldier
stumbled across the stunning collection of drawings and watercolors
stashed in a castle for safekeeping.
   The soldier, an architect in an engineering corps, bundled what
he could off to Moscow, where he stored them in a museum. There
they sat, covered and concealed from the world.
   Now the aging soldier says the pieces should go back to the
Kunsthalle Bremen, their true owner.
   Kunsthalle Bremen director Siegfried Salzmann says about 4,000
items went to a castle northwest of Berlin ``to prevent damage by
air attacks.'' Soviet troops occupied the area in April 1945.
   The Soviet soldier, Viktor Baldin, asked his superiors what was
to be done with the art and when they showed no interest, he packed
off what he could to Moscow, Salzmann said.
   Some of the museum's wartime treasures were returned after 1945,
but many others are still missing, Salzmann said.
   The soldier, now in his 70s, contacted the Bremen museum last
year and told them for the first time that some of what they had
given up for lost was secure in Moscow.
   ``We supposed they could be in the Soviet Union, but we didn't
know,'' Salzmann said in an earlier Associated Press interview. He
was on a business trip today and could not be reached for comment.
   The museum has invited Baldin to Bremen in September to help
write a reminiscence for the museum's catalog. Other artists'
represented included Rembrandt, Degas, Manet, van Dyck and Goya.
   Bremen's art treasures are stored for now in a museum in Moscow.
   During World War II, museums, libraries and churches packed up
their most valuable works and shipped them off for safekeeping,
often to the eastern reaches of Germany, away from Allied bombers.
   In a Texas court, an East German church financed by West Germany
is fighting the heirs of a U.S. soldier who the church claims made
off with a cache of priceless objects hidden in a mine.
   U.S. forces occupied the Quedlinburg area, in what is now East
Germany, in 1945.
   The treasures include a silver, ivory and gold reliquary from
the 9th or 10th century, a 10th century Byzantine rock-crystal
flask and an ivory comb inlaid with precious stones.

   Iraqi planes have turned and flown away
several times after weapons systems radar aboard U.S. jets have
locked onto the Iraqi targets, several Air Force crew chiefs said
today.
   Although the U.S. airmen declined to go into detail, there was
no indication that any of the encounters involved Iraqi planes
attempting to intrude into Saudi Arabian air space.
   ``They don't want to play with us,'' one crew chief said. ``If I
were in a Mirage and an F-15 locked onto me, I'd get out of there
fast, too.''
   Col. John McBroom, commander of the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing
from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, refused to confirm the
reports and said he had instructed his pilots not to discuss any
encounters with Iraqi jets.
   ``I'm not going to get into our encounters,'' he said. But he
did say he considered the U.S. air power here far superior to
Iraq's. ``We're not over here to go to war, but we will finish one
quickly in the air.''
   Another officer in the unit and several crew chiefs said weapons
systems aboard U.S. F-15s have locked onto Iraqi jets several times
during flight missions near the Kuwait-Saudi border.
   ``One of my pilots told me they turn and run as soon as the
radar locks on,'' one crew chief said.
   ``There's been a little cat and mouse but when the weapons lock
on, they're gone,'' said another.
   When asked again later about the encounters reported by crew
chiefs, McBroom said: ``All I'll do is remind you our radar can
lock on at a pretty good range. Beyond that you'll have to ask the
Iraqis.''
   He seemed to be suggesting that the episodes recounted by his
men involved Iraqi planes flying well within Kuwaiti airspace.
   McBroom said the fighter unit felt somewhat vulnerable on the
ground when his unit first arrived last week but now have
coordinated missions with the Saudis and received powerful ground
protection from other U.S. forces, including the massive Patriot
ground-to-air missile systems.
   The reporters visited with the fighter wing this morning at a
Saudi air base where it has set up camp, using spare Saudi hangers,
maintenance garages and other facilities.
   Ground rules for the Pentagon pool operation prohibit the
release of the exact location or the exact number of planes and
other weapons systems, or the publication of the names of
non-command officers.
   The troops are living in Saudi barracks and schools now but a
tent city is under construction on the base, as is a portable
hospital that already is treating about 15 cases of heat stress a
day, according to Air Force officials interviewed today.
   McBroom said the Saudi base facilities are the best he has ever
seen. ``The Saudis build everything big and everything right,'' he
said.
   McBroom and his crew chiefs and maintenance personnel said they
have had very few equipment problems associated with the heat. Most
of the planes are being kept outdoors in the heat because
electronic systems sometimes have temporary troubles when going
from a cool to hot environment, McBroom said.
   The Air Force has extensive stocks of missiles for the jets, and
crews were seen unloading boxes of 20mm shells for their on-board
guns as well.

   Under unwritten common law dating back to the

   Under the law, Sala Shavon Cross, who was shaken into a coma at
3{ months and died 18 months later, took too long to die. Murder
charges against her father, David Lebron Cross, were thrown out
earlier this month.
   The case renewed scrutiny of the ``year and a day'' rule, and an
appeal to be filed with the Georgia Supreme Court this month
provides the state with its best opportunity in nearly a decade to
repeal it.
   The rule, based upon the precedents of English common law and
dating to the 13th century, does not exist in Georgia's official
code but snakes through its judicial decisions and has become
complicated by modern medicine.
   A prosecutor in the case said the rule leaves would-be murder
cases hanging in a limbo created by advances in medical technology.
   ``The moral of this rule is if you hurt somebody, make sure you
hurt them near a hospital, so they can stay on life support for a
year and a day. Then, go on about your business,'' said Cobb County
Assistant District Attorney Bruce Hornbuckle. ``That's the
nightmare scenario.''
   A Cobb County judge threw out murder charges against Cross after
his attorney successfully cited the rule.
   Bert Cohen, Cross's lawyer, said the rule keeps a person from
having the threat of a murder charge follow him through the rest of
his life.
   ``How long should somebody have something like this hanging over
his head?'' asked Cohen. ``We value individual rights in this
country, and it's pretty cruel to have something like this
indefinitely hanging over someone's head.''
   Cross still faces a child cruelty charge and, if convicted,
would face up to 20 years in jail. On the murder charge,
prosecutors had said they would seek a life sentence.
   Over the past decade, many states have moved to purge the rule
through legislation, the courts or a combination of the two, said
Deborah Young, assistant professor of law at Emory University.
   ``Some of the reasons for the law have clearly passed their time
in history,'' she said.
   At least two other states, Nevada and Maryland, still have
``year and a day'' rules; in Nevada it's a state law and in
Maryland it is a matter of common law. Two states, California and
Washington, have rules stipulating three years and a day.
   Cross, 27, was arrested on charges of aggravated battery and
cruelty to children in August 1987, one week after he carried his
unconscious daughter to the hospital. He said the baby had choked
on her formula.
   Medical tests showed evidence of 11 old and new fractures to
Sala's ribs, arms and legs. Doctors said the infant had suffered
irreversible brain damage and would not regain consciousness.
   Cross was jailed but was released on bond four months later as
the child clung to life. He declined to give his consent when the
hospital and Sala's mother, Linda Lawson, asked a judge to allow
doctors to withhold lifesaving efforts if Sala stopped breathing on
her own.
   Fulton Superior Court Judge Don A. Langham denied the request
for continued resuscitation in December 1988, and Sala died two
months later.
   Cross was indicted in October 1989 on charges of murder and
cruelty to children. Cobb County Superior Court Judge Watson White
dismissed the murder charge Aug. 2, saying the ``year and a day''
rule was the law in Georgia.

<HEAD>Guards Accused of Beating Inmates After Riot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials are investigating allegations
that guards at Rikers Island jail lined up and clubbed inmates in
retaliation for a three-hour melee.
   Robert Kasanof, chairman of the Board of Correction, said
Wednesday he had compiled ``significant evidence'' that guards beat
inmates at random several hours after Tuesday night's uprising.
   ``I asked Susan Shepard, the commissioner of investigation, to
conduct an investigation of the systematic nightstick clubbing of
prisoners after the institutions were fully secure _ what is known
as a payback,'' Kasanof said.
   The inmates apparently were angry because guards had blockaded
the jail for two days. The guards were protesting prison violence
and what they called overly lenient treatment of inmates.
   The blockade had kept prisoners from having visitors, disrupted
meal schedules, kept thousands of workers from going home and left
the prison short of guards, officials said.
   Emergency Medical Services spokeswoman Lynn Schulman said 162
people were treated for injuries that included stab wounds, broken
bones, cuts and bruises and back injuries. One inmate who allegedly
stabbed two guards was in critical condition at Elmhurst General
Hospital, corrections officials said.
   Michael Letwin, president of the Association of Legal Aid
Attorneys, which specializes in prisoner rights cases, alleged that
guards took aside inmates who had not been involved in the
disturbance and beat their heads against the wall.
   ``The walls were covered with the inmates' blood,'' he said.
   Phil Seelig, president of the Correction Officers' Benevolent
Association, countered that guards had acted in self-defense after
inmates hurled pipes, sinks and other debris at them.
   ``The officers won the fight and that's what they're supposed to
do!'' he said.
   Mayor David Dinkins ordered city Correction Commissioner Allyn
Sielaff to investigate allegations that inmates were clubbed.
   About 800 inmates went on a rampage as city officials negotiated
an end to the blockade, which was prompted by the Aug. 7 robbery
and beating of a guard by inmates.
   Guards rushed back from the picket line to help put down the
riot at the Otis Bantum center, which holds 1,450 of the island's
total of 14,000 inmates.
   The riot ended after guards used tear gas on three of the 14
dormitories where inmates had set up blockades. The other 11
surrendered.

   Donald Woods, a former
newspaper editor who escaped from South Africa in 1977 after being
banned for challenging a police account of activist Steve Biko's
death, returned from exile today.
   ``I was determined I would never come back here unless I could
do so freely,'' said Woods, whose flight across the border was
depicted in the Richard Attenborough film, ``Cry Freedom.''
   Woods' return to a battery of cameras at Jan Smuts Airport was a
stark contrast to his escape in disguise late on New Year's Eve 12
years ago.
   ``I feel terrific. What a nice welcome,'' Woods told
journalists. A former colleague thrust today's edition of the East
London Daily Dispatch into Woods' hands as he walked into the
arrivals hall.
   Woods was the editor of the Daily Dispatch when he and his
family fled South Africa. Two months before his escape, the
government had served him with a banning order which prevented him
from working as a journalist.
   Woods was placed under partial house arrest and other
restrictions affecting his freedom of movement, association, or
expression. He could not be quoted orally or in writing.
   Woods was banned after he publicly challenged the police version
of the death in detention of his close friend, Biko, the leader of
a group called Black Consciousness.
   Biko, 30, died in police custody on Sept. 12, 1977. At the
inquest into his death, a magistrate ruled that Biko's fatal head
injuries were probably received during questioning but that no
policeman was to blame.
   Woods' book, ``Biko,'' published soon after he went into exile
in London, was used as the basis for ``Cry Freedom.''
   ``I'd still like to know what happened to Steve Biko,'' Woods
said. ``I don't think the circumstances, not only of Steve Biko's
death, but also his life, will ever be forgotten.''
   Woods said he is in South Africa for a six-week ``journey of
rediscovery'' to see friends and family, to work on a book and a
television documentary and to write newspaper articles.
   When Woods left the country in 1977, South Africa's black
townships were in turmoil. Only days before his return, they
erupted again. But Woods described the current violence as the
``problems of recovery'' rather than the ``problems of decline''
which he said caused the 1970s unrest.
   ``I have always felt confident about South Africa's future in
the long-term because of the wealth of all the people,'' he said.
``With the caliber of the people allied with the natural wealth, it
would take quite a lot of bad planning for things to go wrong in
the long-term.''

<HEAD>Report: High Radiation Levels Detected In Soviet Arms Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Karachay Lake, a 100-acre body of water in the
Soviet Union, could be ``the most polluted spot on the planet,''
the result of years of radioactive waste dumping, according to a
published report today.
   U.S. experts who recently visited a Soviet nuclear weapons
production complex found extremely high levels of radioactive
contamination and a history of high doses to production workers,
The New York Times reported.
   The Soviets have confirmed that in 1951, atomic bomb makers
began pumping radioactive wastes into Karachay Lake _ about 900
miles east of Moscow _ a practice that continued until the
accumulation reached 120 million curies.
   That amount is about 2{ times greater than the release from the
Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986.
   ``This has got to be the must polluted spot on the planet,''
said Thomas B. Cochran, a physicist and senior staff scientist at
the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private environmental
group in Washington.
   The dose rate on the lake shore near the outlet pipe is 600
roentgen per hour, according to a new report by Cochran and Robert
Standish Norris, also at the council.
   At that rate, one hour's exposure would kill a person within
weeks, the Times reported.
   The Times said Soviet documents describe a ``sanitary alienation
zone'' in contaminated areas in which people are forbidden to live
or travel. The zone's size was unknown.
   ``Provided you keep away from it, which they are, it is causing
no harm to public health,'' said Richard Wilson, a Harvard
University physicist who has studied the Soviet nuclear complex.
``I would characterize it as greater than anything we've even
contemplated in this country.''
   Recent Soviet disclosures also show very high worker exposures,
the newspaper said.
   Other scientists who have visited the area recently say the lake
was extremely contaminated, but they disagreed on the degree of
contamination.
   Estimates ranged from as high as 600 roentgen per hour down to
six, said Frank L. Parker, an engineering professor at Vanderbilt
University and chairman of the National Academy of Sciences board
on radioactive waste management. He was at the Chelyabinsk site in
June.
   But whether 600 or six, Parker said, both constitute an
``astronomical dosage.''
   Even the lower figure would surpass the maximum allowable
exposure for an American worker for a year, the Times reported.

<TEXT>
   Egypt's state-run news agency today quoted
travelers leaving Iraq as saying many military officers and
civilians have been arrested after a failed attempt on President
Saddam Hussein's life.
   Without naming its informants, the agency said the ``large-scale
arrests'' occurred on Wednesday and that the abortive attempt on
the Iraqi president's life was made by ``a number of close
associates'' of Saddam.
   But it did not say when or how the assassination attempt took
place.
   There was no independent confirmation of the report. The agency
is controlled by the government's Information Ministry.
   The report quoted one unidentified traveler arriving in Jordan
as saying ``visible tension and worry prevailed'' in Baghdad. He
said soldiers were out in force manning checkpoints and tanks and
armored cars patrolled the streets.
   Egypt strongly condemned Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion and subsequent
annexation of Kuwait. It is participating in a joint Arab force
sanctioned by a summit conference in Cairo on Aug. 10.
   The agency's Cairo-dated report said the detainees ``included
tens of officers of various ranks, particularly low ranks.''
   The agency also quoted what it described as an account by an
unidentified emissary of the PLO describing how he met with Saddam
to deliver a message from the leadership of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The envoy said he met Saddam in an underground bunker at a
military barracks outside Baghdad. The report quoted the
Palestinian as saying the Iraqi leader appeared ``extremely weary,
dazed, clearly nervous.''

<HEAD>Former Judge Criticized For Remarks on Irish, `German Jew'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading former judge came under fire today for
reportedly disputing the innocence of Irish people cleared by the
courts, and suggesting British sovereignty was under threat from
``a German Jew.''
   Lord Denning later insisted his remarks to the weekly Spectator
magazine were reported in a ``very misleading and erroneous'' way.
   The interviewer, novelist A.N. Wilson, wrote that Denning
cleared the remarks about the Irish for publication. He did not say
whether Denning cleared the remark about Jews, but Denning said
later: ``That is just the sort of thing I would hate having put in
a paper at all.''
   Denning, 91, was master of the rolls, the highest civil judge in
England, when he retired in 1982. An internationally renowned legal
authority, he remains an influential voice on British judicial
issues.
   In the interview, published in question-and-answer form, Denning
attacked the growing power of the European Community to influence
British internal affairs.
   He singled out EC official Sir Leon Brittan, a lawyer and former
Cabinet minister who is now on the commission that governs the
12-nation European Community.
   According to The Spectator, Denning said of Brittan that ``he
was no good'' as a lawyer, and added: ``A German Jew, isn't he?''
   Wilson: ``What's that got to do with it?''
   Denning: ``Look him up. I think you'll find he's a German Jew,
telling us what to do with our English law. It's quite plain that
these pan-Europeans do not go by the words of the (EC) treaty.''
   Brittan is the London-born son of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants.
He was on vacation and unavailable for comment, his office said.
   Hayim Pinner, secretary general of the Board of Deputies of
British Jews, denounced Denning's ``quite disgraceful, and
gratuitous, and, as it happens, inaccurate remark.''
   Wilson quoted Denning as decrying the public campaigns that have
quashed or undermined the convictions of alleged Irish terrorists.
   The death penalty, abolished in 1965, should have been retained
``for murder most foul,'' Denning said. ``We shouldn't have all
these campaigns to get the Birmingham Six released if they'd been
hanged. They'd have been forgotten, and the whole community would
be satisfied.''
   The Birmingham Six are Irishmen serving life sentences for
terrorist bombings in 1974 that killed 19 people. Their supporters
say they were convicted on bad forensic evidence and confessions
extracted under duress.
   Denning also questioned the innocence of the so-called Guildford
Four, who were jailed for life in 1975 for bombings that claimed
five lives. They were freed last year after an appeals court
quashed their convictions.
   Wilson asked Denning: ``If they had hanged the Guildford Four
they would have hanged the wrong men, wouldn't they?''
   Denning replied: ``No. They'd probably have hanged the right
men.''
   Later, he told BBC-TV: ``Their convictions were quashed, but
that does not mean they were innocent. It only means their
convictions were not safe. That's all.''
   On BBC Radio he said: ``I'm very annoyed at The Spectator
magazine which has misinterpreted me altogether, which has misled
the public, and has attributed to me defamatory things which I
never said and would never entertain.''
   Breda Power, daughter of one of the Birmingham Six, said: ``I
don't take what Denning has said seriously. He is obviously getting
very old and does not know what he is talking about.''
   Anita Richards, a campaigner for the Birmingham Six, said: ``We
are outraged at Lord Denning's hysteria.''

<TEXT>
   The spacecraft Magellan was ordered to
bounce radar off Venus today for the first time to test its
picture-making ability, which won't be harmed by glitches with a
computer and radio transmitter, NASA says.
   The test, scheduled for late afternoon, was expected to produce
a postage stamp-sized picture of a 15-by-15-mile area of Venus'
surface, although the picture won't be processed until the weekend,
Tony Spear, Magellan project manager at the agency's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, said Wednesday.
   Spear said earlier the picture wouldn't be released unless it
revealed an interesting discovery.
   Magellan's formal program to make detailed maps and pictures of
Venus starts Aug. 29 or Sept. 1. The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration plans to release the first images during September.
   Venus, the second planet from the sun, is covered by thick
clouds, so radar must be used to make images of its surface.
   The radar was turned on for an hour Wednesday, just to show it
was working, for the first time since Magellan went into orbit
around Venus last Friday after a 948-million-mile trip from Earth.
   The radar previously was turned on for tests during May and
December while Magellan cruised toward Venus.
   Spear said Magellan's minor troubles won't harm its $744 million
mission.
   ``Just like everything in life, this spacecraft has little
idiosyncrasies and little warts, and we're experiencing some of
those. They are minor and we can work around them, but they do take
some time,'' he said.
   One minor problem developed Tuesday when the backup to
Magellan's main radio transmitter shut off when it wasn't supposed
to do so.
   ``We just turned it back on again,'' Spear said.
   Similar unwanted shutdowns plagued the main transmitter during
Magellan's journey to Venus, so the backup has been acting as the
spacecraft's main transmitter.
   The other glitch, which NASA revealed Sunday, involves a failed
computer chip that caused commands to be rejected by a backup
computer that helps aim Magellan. Engineers plan to bypass the
faulty chip, as they did after another chip failed last Dec. 31.
   Spear said that problem may take two weeks to two months to fix.
   Magellan was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989.

<HEAD>Gorbachev, Yeltsin Return To Moscow To Work On Economic Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is interrupting his
summer vacation in the Crimea and returning to Moscow to work on
his program for restructuring the Soviet economy, Tass reported
today.
   The Soviet news agency quoted Russian President Boris N.
Yeltsin, who broke off his tour of the vast Russian republic on
Wednesday for similar reasons.
   Tass said Gorbachev is expected to return to Moscow ``within the
next days.'' Gorbachev began his vacation in early August and had
been expected to be away from the capital for a month.
   Gorbachev and Yeltsin agreed earier this month to draft a joint
program for moving toward a market economy, based on the ``500
Days'' program developed by economists in the Russian republic.
   The two leaders appointed a 12-member group to work out the
details, including Gorbachev's top economic adviser, Nikolai Y.
Petrakov, a strong proponent of market refomrs; Deputy Prime
Minister Leonid A. Abalkin; Presidential Council member Stanislav
Shatalin; and officials of the Russian republic, the nation's
largest.
   Yeltsin met today with the working group and told reporters it
was having trouble getting information from the Soviet Finance and
Defense Ministries and could not even obtain a copy of the current
Soviet budget.
   He blamed the obstacles on ``either a lack of desire or
sabotage,'' the news service Interfax reported.
   Yeltsin said the joint economic program was scheduled to be
implemented Oct. 1, and in its initial phase would be designed to
stabilize the economy.
   By Jan. 1, steps will have been taken to correct problems in
money circulation and strengthen the ruble, a non-covertible
currency, and to halt the drop in its buying power, he said.
   Yeltsin said his republic would implement the program earlier
than the central government if agreement could not be reached on
the final, joint draft.
   He said Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov was working on a
parallel program.
   Yeltsin was elected president of the huge Russian Federation,
with three-quarters of the Soviet land mass and half its people, in
June. He quit the Communist Party in July, starting an exodus of
leading reformers.

<HEAD>Guardians Appointed for Children in Forced Bone Marrow Donor Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 12-year-old leukemia victim battling for life
has won a narrow legal skirmish in his attempt to force twin
half-siblings to be tested as potential bone marrow donors, but the
victory has been postponed.
   Circuit Judge Monica Reynolds denied a motion Wednesday to
postpone appointing guardians for the twins and for Jean-Pierre
Bosze, who doctors say needs a transplant to stand any chance of
survival.
   But the state Supreme Court later stayed the guardians _ two
Chicago lawyers _ from taking any action until it could reconsider
its original ruling calling for their appointment. The court gave
no indication when it would reconsider the ruling.
   The boy needs a donation from someone whose tissue type closely
matches his. Donor bone marrow, to replace his own diseased tissue,
would contain the cells which produce blood cells.
   Jean-Pierre's attorney, Edward Jordan, wanted a guardian
appointed for the twins in hopes the guardian will recommend
allowing the boy's 3-year-old half-brother and half-sister to be
tested.
   The twins' mother, Nancy Curran, opposes testing, and the judge
ruled July 18 that she has no power to overrule her. Ms. Curran
claims the blood tests would be an invasion of privacy, may be
painful and could subject the twins to lasting medical problems.
   ``To subject a healthy child to bodily intrusions, against the
will of the custodial parent in order to attempt to save a diseased
child ... is not a duty the courts can impose upon a child or
anyone else,'' the judge said.
   Ms. Curran's attorney, Beverly Pekala, said there's no need for
guardians.
   ``The trial record is replete with evidence that all children
involved with this case have had their interests zealously
protected,'' she argued.
   Jean-Pierre's father, Tamas Bosze, said Ms. Curran _ who's a
former girlfriend _ is wrong to forbid the compatibility tests.
   ``The children would decide differently if they were grown up,''
Bosze said. ``If my brother asked me for a blood test, I would say
`sure.' ''
   Bosze said Jeanne-Pierre recently underwent five days of
chemotherapy and that doctors are close to bringing the disease
under control to allow a transplant. He said many non-relatives
have volunteered as donors, but none has proved to be compatible.

<TEXT>
   A study today concludes that the only medication
approved for treating Alzheimer's disease is useless and may
actually make the disease worse.
   Researchers found that patients who took Hydergine, the 11th
most prescribed drug in the world, deteriorated faster than those
who got dummy pills.
   In their report, the researchers said this was a surprise, and
they were unsure why it happened.
   ``We can only speculate that the drug may cause cognitive
dysfunction, perhaps through a direct toxic effect or by
accelerating the progression of Alzheimer's disease,'' they wrote.
   Researchers described the study, conducted on 80 older adults at
the University of Colorado medical school, as the most extensive
U.S. attempt to evaluate the drug's effects. The findings were
published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   Hydergine is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for treatment of Alzheimer's, an incurable brain
disease that slowly robs its victims of the ability to function.
The drug supposedly reduces memory loss and other symptoms of
dementia.
   ``It's a useless drug,'' said one of the study's authors, Dr.
Christopher M. Filley, assistant professor at the medical school.
   The study, begun in 1985, was paid for by the Sandoz
Pharmaceuticals Corp. of East Hanover, N.J., which has manufactured
and marketed Hydergine worldwide for more than 20 years. The drug
costs patients about $700 a year.
   Patients in the six-month study were given either a placebo or
the drug. Neither the doctor nor the patient knew which substance
was being administered. Those getting Hydergine scored worse on
tests that measured mental function and behavior.
   Filley said some patients hold out great hope for Hydergine and
may perceive that the drug is helping in some way. He said he will
continue to prescribe the drug for those patients.
   Alzheimer's is believed to affect as many as 4 million Americans.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has restored the
citizenship of exiled writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn and 22 other
prominent Soviets now living abroad, a presidential spokesman
confirmed today.
   Valentin Kulikov, a representative of Gorbachev's press office,
told the Tass news agency a presidential decree on restoration of
citizenship also applies to writers Vasily Aksyonov, Vladimir
Voinovich, Lev Kopelev and Georgi Vladimov. Scientists Yuri Orlov,
Valeri Chalidze and chess player Viktor Korchnoi were also among
those covered by the decree issued Wednesday.
   The government newspaper Izvestia added the name of an artist,
Oskar Rabin.
   A complete list was not provided and there was no mention of
Nobel Prize-winning writer Joseph Brodsky. A Soviet official
suggested Wednesday that he would be included in those having their
citizenship restored. Brodsky, a poet and essayist, emigrated to
New York in 1972 under threat of imprisonment for his political
comments.
   Under Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Soviet government revoked the
citizenship of prominent authors and artists who spoke out against
domestic repression. Tass said the order dealt with ``injustices
that occurred between 1966 and 1988.''
   Gennady Cheremnykh, head of the citizenship and pardoning
department of the Supreme Soviet's Secretariat, told Izvestia that
Solzhenitsyn had agreed to accept Soviet citizenship.
Solzhenitsyn's wife indicated otherwise.
   In a statement issued in her husband's name from their Vermont
home, Natalia Solzhenitsyn said Wednesday: ``In Solzhenitsyn's
case, the original decree was not only a deprivation of
citizenship, but before that a forced eviction from the U.S.S.R.
that was accomplished through arrest and the accusation of treason.
Since nothing has been said about that in today's resolution, it
does not apply to Solzhenitsyn.''
   Solzhenitsyn is the author of ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' which
depicted the horrors of dictator Josef Stalin's prison camps. He
was charged with high treason in 1974, stripped of his citizenship
and exiled.
   Solzhenitsyn won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1970. His
other works include ``One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and
``Cancer Ward.''
   He has said he would not return to the Soviet Union unless all
his books were published and widely available. A number of his
books have been printed, but almost nothing is widely available in
the shortage-plagued Soviet Union.
   Korchnoi welcomed the restoration of his Soviet citizenship as
an ``important step'' but he said he would not return home.
   ``I have predicted years ago that Gorbachev will make great
moves toward democratization,'' Korchnoi said in a telephone
interview. ``This is another step very important for the future
because of its humanitarian nature.''
   He said he was honored to be on the ``list of outstanding
persons'' covered by the decree. ``But I will not make use of the
opportunity'' to go home, said Korchnoi, who was reached at his
home in northeastern Switzerland.
   The full list of 23 writers, academics and musicians deprived of
citizenship and now getting it back will be published later this
month in a parliamentary periodical, Kulikov said.
   Among those listed are:
   _Orlov, a prominent dissident and one of the founders of the
Helsinki Monitoring Group in Moscow. Arrested and exiled for his
human rights work, he was allowed to leave for the United States
after the Soviets released American journalist Nick Daniloff.
   _Rabin, one of the organizers of a non-conformist art exhibit in
Moscow that was bulldozed in 1974. He was later forced to emigrate.
   _Aksyonov, author of the 1960 bestseller, ``Kollegi.'' He was
criticized by Soviet authorities for his ``bad language,'' which
actually was the slang of Soviet youth. He emigrated after a brush
with the authorities in 1980.

   A tanker struck and sank an Army Corps of
Engineers living-quarters barge with about 100 people aboard early
today, the Coast Guard said. At least 50 people were hurt in the
accident on the Mississippi River.
   The barge, a floating metal platform with a building similar to
a motel on top, was tied to a dock when it was hit by the empty,
800-foot Hong Kong tanker Mandan, Coast Guard spokesman Steve Guy
said. The barge came to rest partially submerged.
   The workers aboard the barge made it to shore before it went
down within a half-hour in about 20 feet of water.
   ``It went down real fast and we were fortunate that we had no
serious injuries,'' said Corps spokesman Dennis Norris.
   Crewmen aboard the barge said there was no warning.
   ``There was a big bang. Jump up out of your sleep and run out
the door and when you get there there's nothing but water,'' said
one unidentified crewman.
   The injured were taken to hospitals for treatment. Officials
said most of the injuries appeared to be minor such as back strains
and bruises. Guy said the injured were apparently hurt by the
impact and that there were no reports of anyone being thrown
overboard.
   No injuries were reported on the tanker.
   The cause of the accident was not immediately known.
   The tanker sustained some damage but proceeded to Pilottown,
about 10 miles downstream, the spokesman said.
   The accident occurred near Venice, which is near the mouth of
the Mississippi, about 80 miles below New Orleans.

   A small fire of suspicious origin broke out
today in the loft of the Rodin Museum, but caused little or no
damage.
   The museum, a branch of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, houses
the world's largest single collection outside France of works by
sculptor Auguste Rodin.
   Firefighters controlled the fire in six minutes, said fire
department Lt. Jack Christmas, adding that the cause was
undetermined but suspicious.
   A piece of cloth apparently caught fire and set off an alarm,
museum spokeswoman Carrie Stavrakos said.
   ``The guard came in and discovered it, called the fire company,
and it was put out immediately,'' she said. ``There was no damage
at all to the museum.''
   Christmas described damage as minor.

<TEXT>
   An estimated 8,000 of the ever-faithful
heaped long-stemmed red roses and small teddy bears on Elvis
Presley's grave today in a candlelight vigil marking the 13th
anniversary of his death.
   ``His music isn't dead, and there's a whole new generation
that's going through it all again,'' said Grace Caputo, 29. She
accompanied 16 other Elvis fans from Adelaide, Australia, in the
procession past Presley's grave.
   Stands of flower arrangements, many in the shape of hearts and
guitars, surrounded the gravesite and lined both sides of a small
walkway leading to it. The flowers, from fan clubs around the
world, carried such messages as ``Elvis, we miss you so much'' and
`` Love is forever.''
   The graveside vigil, which got under way Wednesday night, drew
Elvis fans from around the country and abroad.
   It is single largest gathering in a string of concerts, dances,
souvenir fairs and other events tied to the anniversary. A memorial
service featuring Elvis' friends and relatives was scheduled for
this afternoon at Memphis State University.
   ``What makes this special is Elvis is here,'' said Bettie Dodd,
51, a member of the Elvis Country Fan Club of Austin, Texas, which
organizes the annual procession. ``Everything else is
commercialized, but this is paying a tribute to Elvis.''
   Presley died on Aug. 16, 1977, at his white-columned Graceland
residence. He is buried alongside his father, mother and
grandmother in a small garden beside the house.
   Participants held lighted candles as they walked single file up
Graceland's quarter-mile drive. Many carried single red roses to
leave at the grave. Roses were on sale for $4.95 each at a souvenir
shop across the street.
   ``I have waited 10 years for this,'' said Dino Riolo, 26, of
Milan, Italy. ``In a few moments, I will see the grave of the
biggest, absolutely biggest, singer of the whole world, of the
whole universe.''
   ``When I hear his music, I feel something. The others,
nothing,'' said her friend, Jimmy Sorce, who said he sings in an
Italian rock band.
   Graceland draws more than 600,000 visitors a year. The week
surrounding the anniversary of Presley's death is the special time
for his fans.
   ``I flew down the night of his death and I've come back every
year since then,'' said Bill Rowe, 40, of Dayton, Ohio. ``There was
just something about the guy that said to me, `I'm your friend.' ''
   Presley was 22 when he bought Graceland for $100,000 in 1957. He
was 42 when he fell dead on a bathroom floor there.
   A medical examiner listed the cause of death as heart disease.
Court testimony revealed Presley was addicted to prescription drugs.

<HEAD>American Legion Members Resign After Black Rejected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLORENCE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several members of an American Legion post
resigned after the organization refused to admit a black member.
   At least two of the post officers and one member quit after six
members of the Fred H. Sexton Post 1 voted against the black
applicant at a July 3 meeting, the Florence Morning News reported
today. Only two votes are required to reject an applicant, the News
said.
   ``I don't want one in here,'' past Post Commander William D.
Leftridge said during a debate over the application of a black
Vietnam veteran, according to the minutes of the meeting. ``For 70
years since the post was chartered, there hasn't been one in here
and I don't want to see it now.''
   Leftridge did not return telephone calls today.
   The Morning News said at least three members of the post
resigned, and WDAR radio in Darlington quoted unidentified sources
as saying that six members had resigned.
   The black applicant, Thurmond L. Thompson, is a Vietnam veteran
who works at General Electric Co., the radio station reported.
   Besides Leftridge, other post members said at the meeting they
could not vote for a black.
   Florence has two American Legion posts. Post 1 has no black
members and Post 228 has no white members.
   The American Legion's national headquarters in Indianapolis
asked the South Carolina headquarters to begin an investigation
into the incident, said Phillip Onderdonk, the organization's judge
advocate. The post could lose its charter, he said.
   A telephone call to B.L. Black, the department adjutant of the
state American Legion, was not immediately returned.
   Some American Legion members said the opposition to Thompson
stunned them.
   ``I was sitting there like a lot of the other members _ in
shock,'' said Ken LaFevor, a post member who resigned soon after
the meeting.
   ``There's one color in the military and that was green. And I
know we all shed the same color blood,'' said LaFevor, who was a
member of the post for about 18 months.
   ``I was really hurt. I just couldn't believe what I was
hearing,'' said local post 2nd Vice Commander James N. Maurer,
adding he resigned immediately after the meeting.
   Maria Lewis, the former post secretary who remained a member,
said Wednesday that it is against state bylaws to integrate the
Legion. She is the Florence County veterans affairs officer.
   ``We have to keep a black post and white post separate, and when
we have conventions we will all combine. But as far as blacks
coming in here to be our members, they don't want us to join their
post and we can't have them join ours,'' Lewis said.
   The Legion has allowed blacks since it was first created in
1919, Onderdonk said.

<TEXT>
   Iraq's President Saddam Hussein today
accused President Bush of trying to discredit him by labeling him a
liar, and claimed Bush was misleading the American people about the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``We continue to pray and pray hard to God so that there will be
no confrontation whereby you will receive thousands of Americans
wrapped in sad coffins,'' Saddam said in a statement read by an
announcer on Iraqi television.
   ``You, president of the United States, have chosen to be a
liar,'' he said in comments translated by The Associated Press.
``You have lied to your people.''
   If there is a military clash, he said, ``You're going to be
defeated.''
   ``I used to think that you were much more far-sighted than you
actually displayed,'' the Iraqi president said in a statement
billed as an open letter to Bush.
   A spoken translation also was provided by Cable News Network,
but _ since the speech was aimed at Bush _ it also carried
subtitles provided by Iraqi TV.
   In his most personal statement to date on the crisis that began
with his Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the Iraqi president accused
Bush of trying to humiliate Arabs by the use of U.S. military force.
   Saddam's statement came as Jordan's King Hussein was flying to
Maine from Washington to meet with Bush. The Jordanian monarch was
reportedly bearing a message from Saddam.
   A day earlier, in a speech at the Pentagon, Bush said Saddam had
lied to his Arab neighbors about his intentions in Kuwait, and said
such dishonesty made him a threat to strategic Saudi Arabia.
   ``It is Saddam who invaded an Arab state. It is Saddam who now
threatens the Arab nation,'' Bush said then. ``We, by contrast, now
seek to assist our Arab friends in their hour of need.''
   Iraq has insisted it has no intention of attacking Saudi Arabia,
where about 20,000 U.S. troops already have been dispatched to
counter any further Iraqi seizure of the huge oil reserves in the
Persian Gulf. Other nations with troops in Saudi Arabia include
Egypt, Syria, Morocco and Bangladesh.
   In the statement, Saddam referred to Iraq as ``this great Arab
nation chosen by God to be the nation of prophets.''
   Without directly mentioning his own occupation of Kuwait, Saddam
said the foreign forces in Saudi Arabia were the true occupiers.
   Saddam's overthrow of Kuwait has been widely condemned by the
international community, which has imposed choking economic
sanctions against him.
   In the statement, Saddam repeated a threat to act to defend
Islamic holy sites in Saudi Arabia _ an indirect threat against the
multinational forces in the desert kingdom.
   Saddam's statement also followed a report earlier today by the
Egypt's Middle East News Agency, saying the Iraqi president had
been the target of an assassination attempt.
   The report quoted travelers from Iraq as saying the alleged
assassination bid had prompted large-scale arrests and a military
clampdown in the Iraqi capital. The report could not be
independently confirmed.

<HEAD>Most Adult Men In Ivory Coast Capital Die From AIDS</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release after 6:30 p.m. EST Thursday</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS has become the leading cause of death
among adult men in the West African city of Abidjan, the magazine
Science says. It is the second most common cause in adult women
there, after deaths related to pregnancy and abortion.
   A recent study in the Ivory Coast capital city found a minimum
annual incidence of AIDS of 1,447 cases per million in adult men
and 340 per million in adult women, Science said in its Aug. 17
edition.
   The study of cadavers was done in a 62-day and 43-day period.
Among 698 adult bodies examined, 41 percent of men and 32 percent
of women were infected with HIV, the agent that causes Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome. The highest rates were found in men and
women aged 30 to 39.
   Science said the figures ``probably underestimate the true
mortality due to HIV infection.'' Among factors skewing the figures
were the exclusion of pediatric patients, the unknown proportion of
AIDS deaths not brought to the mortuaries studied, and the cultural
practice of seriously ill persons leaving Abidjan to die in their
home areas.
   In addition, deaths due to pulmonary tuberculosis _ the third
ranking cause of male adult death _ specifically were not counted
as AIDS cases, although 50 percent of such cadavers tested HIV
positive.
   ``Although data concerning mortality due to AIDS are scarce,''
the article said, ``AIDS is likely to be the leading cause of adult
death in a number of other African cities also.''
   In the United States, according to the Centers for Disease
Control, there were 16.1 cases of AIDS per 100,000 population in
the year ending in July.

<TEXT>
   President Joaquin
Balaguer was sworn in to a sixth term today following a two-day
strike and anti-government unrest that left at least 11 people dead.
   Balaguer, 83 and blind, took the oath of office from Supreme
Court President Nestor Contin Aybar in the Assembly chamber of the
National Congress. He narrowly defeated his longtime leftist rival
Juan Bosch in a disputed election May 16.
   It is Balaguer's second consecutive four-year term and his sixth
as leader of this Caribbean nation of 7 million people.
   President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela was the only foreign
head of state to attend the inauguration. Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole headed the U.S. delegation.
   Haiti's President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot did not attend as
previously announced. There was no immediate explanation for her
absence.
   The conservative president's austerity program announced last
week cut subsidies and raised prices. It prompted violent protests,
including a crippling strike and rioting Monday and Tuesday.
   Last month, one person died and 20 people were injured as
security forces clashed with demonstrators protesting the disputed
presidential election.
   The austerity program recommended by the International Monetary
Fund, which lends to developing countries, was aimed at cutting an
inflation rate of more than 50 percent.
   The government cut subsidies on a series of basic consumer
items, including gasoline, sugar and flour. Gasoline went up 83.6
percent from 55 cents a gallon to $1.07.
   The minimum monthly salaries are $69 for public employees and
$96 for private sector employees.
   The country, whose largest export item is sugar, was hit hard by
a fall in sugar prices and its unemployment rate is about 25
percent. Electricity blackouts and currency devaluations are common.
   In his last term, Balaguer embarked on an ambitious $2 billion
construction program funded largely with money he printed. It
created hundreds of jobs but caused runaway inflation.
   Much of the construction was aimed at expanding a tourist
industry that stands to benefit in 1992 from the 500th anniversary
of Columbus' voyage.
   Balaguer won re-election May 16 by a less than 2 percent margin.
Former leftist president Juan Bosch, 81, who was the main rival,
accused Balaguer of election fraud.
   After a review of tally sheets, the Central Electoral Board
certified Balaguer's victory and said it found no evidence of fraud.
   Balaguer first served as president in 1960 when he was named to
a caretaker position by dictator Gen. Rafael Trujillo.
   Trujillo was killed in 1961 and Balaguer served as head of state
until 1962. He was first elected in 1966, winning re-election in
1970 and 1974. He was defeated in 1978, but was re-elected in 1986.
   Balaguer, blind from glaucoma, was a lawyer and author of about
20 books. He is founder and leader of conservative Social Christian
Reformist Party.
   The Dominican Republic shares eastern two-thirds of the
Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti. The Spanish-speaking
country is roughly the size of Massachusetts.

   A passenger bus skidded into a ravine in
central Portugal on Thursday, killing at least 15 people and
injuring 37, traffic police said.
   A police spokesman said there may be more dead and injured in
the wreckage. Portugal's Lusa news agency reported as many as 30
people could have perished.
   The bus spun off a road near the village of Arcos, 150 miles
north of Lisbon.
   The express bus, belonging to Portugal's state-owned Rodoviaria
Nacional bus service, was bringing 52 passengers to Lisbon from
northeastern Tras-os-Montes province, police said.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately clear.
   According to a witness quoted by Lusa, the bus went out of
control after a tire blew out.
   But a survivor told Lusa the bus driver was speeding to make up
for lost time. ``At a certain moment he lost control of the vehicle
and we ended up falling down a steep slope,'' said the survivor,
Irene Cardoso.

   Zairean students occupied their embassy in
Beijing, holding the ambassador and five staff members inside, and
said Thursday they would not end the 2-day-old standoff until their
government paid for air tickets home.
   The students began occupying the embassy Tuesday to protest the
Zairean government's failure to provide promised living allowances
and air tickets home for graduates. About 40 were in the embassy
Thursday.
   Last year, Zairean students staged a 10-day sit-in at the
embassy for the same reason.
   There are more than 80 Zairean students in China, and they have
not received government subsidies for the past 14 months. Seven
graduates whose air tickets were to be provided by the Zaire
government have had no way of returning home.
   The students were not armed, but they locked the embassy
compound gates with a bicycle chain and refused to allow the
ambassador and five other diplomats or embassy personnel out.
Chinese staff were not allowed to enter.
   On Thursday, Ambassador Lombo Lo Mangamanga said he arranged for
the Chinese government to provide transportation home for the
students who needed it, but the protesters refused to accept this.
   Arguing that their government should honor its promises, the
students resolved not to leave the embassy until the Zaire
government pays for the tickets.
   The ambassador said the tickets were an advance from the Chinese
government and that the Zaire government would pay for them once
funds arrived in Beijing.
   ``It's a recurring problem,'' said Lega, a machinery student at
Tianjin University who gave only his first name. ``Students will
have the same fight next year'' if we accept this settlement.
   Both the ambassador and the students said no progress has been
made on getting funds for the students' living allowances.
   The students have said their government should stop sending
students to China if it is unable to provide promised money and
plane tickets.
   The Zaireans are one of the largest groups of African students
in China. Under friendship agreements signed in the 1960s, China
gives scholarships to students from many African countries to
complete degree programs in China, usually in the sciences.

<HEAD>Ruling Party Endorses Multiparty System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling party's Central Committee
has endorsed resolutions calling for adoption of a multiparty
system and new election laws, meeting a key demand of rebels
fighting the government.
   The party, FRELIMO, endorsed the changes at a nine-day meeting
that ended Wednesday. The government news agency AIM said the
Central Committee unanimously voted in support of the two
resolutions.
   President Joaquim Chissano said July 31 he wanted to see a
multiple party system in place for parliamentary and presidential
elections scheduled next year. Chissano had opposed a multiparty
system until early this year, saying it would encourage tribalism
and waste the country's scarce resources.
   But he also has promised to end the civil war, which has claimed
600,000 lives and caused widespread hunger among Mozambique's 15
million people.
   Mozambique National Resistance rebels have been fighting the
government for 13 years. Their demands include free elections under
a multiparty system.
   FRELIMO has been the sole legal political party in the southeast
African nation since Mozambique gained independence from Portugal
in 1975. FRELIMO was Marxist, but it has undergone reforms in
recent years and officially dropped its Marxist label last year.
   According to the resolution for a multiparty system, it would be
illegal for parties to be set up according to racial, ethnic,
regional or religious lines, AIM reported. Forming a party would
require proven support of at least 1,100 eligible voters.
   The other resolution calls for changes in the current election
law to create a voter registration process and address the question
of proportional representation. It also recommended that peasants
and women be included in the electoral process.
   AIM said two working groups have been set up to draft the laws,
which would be submitted to the People's Assembly, or parliament.

<HEAD>Military Ruler Remembered Fondly By Some Pakistanis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After 20 turbulent months of
democracy, many Pakistanis are fondly reminiscing about Gen.
Mohammad Zia ul Haq and preparing to honor the military dictator
who ruled for more than a decade.
   Zia died two years ago Friday in a mysterious plane crash.
Everyone on board was killed, including several top generals and
the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Arnold Raphael.
   The anniversary of Zia's death comes less than two weeks after
Benazir Bhutto's government was dismissed on charges of corruption,
nepotism and ineptitude.
   Ms. Bhutto, whose father was ousted by Zia in 1977, claims a
similar coup was staged against her but camouflaged by relying on
the constitution to oust her.
   Her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was hanged in 1979 on charges
of conspiring in a murder attempt on a political enemy. Ms. Bhutto
blamed Zia for her father's execution.
   While she was prime minister, Ms. Bhutto proclaimed her father a
martyr. A similar claim now is being made by Zia's son, Ijaz ul Haq.
   Six-foot-high posters of the former military ruler line the wide
boulevards of the capital. Giant banners proclaiming Zia a martyr
flutter in the warm summer breeze.
   ``Zia gave Pakistan back its honor,'' Ijaz said.
   Hundreds of people daily make the pilgrimage to Zia's grave. He
is remembered by many as a humble and compassionate man.
   Ijaz, a 38-year-old banker, plans to use his father's death
anniversary to launch his political career. Elections are scheduled
Oct. 24, but speculation is rife they will be postponed and that
another round of military rule is inevitable.
   ``Benazir Bhutto's father was a civilian dictator and she came
to power. Why can't the son of Zia ul Haq?'' asked Ijaz.
   ``I believed in what my father did. There is no doubt about
it,'' he said.
   A framed picture of the former dictator dominates Ijaz's living
room. Propped up at its side is a smaller picture of Zia, one hand
on his heart, in front of the White House with former President
Reagan striking a similar pose.
   His father was buried at Islamabad's Faisal Mosque, one of the
world's largest mosques.
   On the eve of the anniversary, the sprawling grounds of the
giant mosque at the foot of the lush Margalla hills took on the
atmosphere of a festival.
   Brightly colored tents were erected and vendors hawking fast
food, ice cream and souvenirs set up stalls.
   Ijaz will place wreaths on the graves of the generals killed
along with his father before traveling in a procession to the
Faisal Mosque on Friday.
   The ceremony will be launched with a prayer to be said at
exactly 3:51 p.m., the time Zia's the Hercules C-130 crashed into a
desert plain in eastern Punjab Province.
   Zia had been at Bahawalpur to witness a demonstration of the
U.S.-made M-1 tank. The plane had been in the air less than five
minutes when it weaved out of control and nosedived into the
desert, according to witnesses.
   A technical raport charged sabotage, but a criminal
investigation was never pursued. Ms. Bhutto's government made a
weak attempt at probing the crash and the U.S. government waited a
year before sending investigators.
   Ijaz blames Al-Zulfikar, a group led by Ms. Bhutto's brother,
Murtaza. That group hijacked a plane in the mid-1980s, and
according to Zia, were behind several failed assassination attempts.
   He also claims Pakistan's President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the army
and the United States staged a cover-up.

   Housing starts in July remained mired at
depths not seen since the last recession, the government reported
Thursday, and analysts forecast little, if any, improvement for the
remainder of the year.
   ``We're in a severe slump,'' said economist Rob Rosenblatt of
the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   ``A housing recession,'' added Lawrence A. Hunter, deputy chief
economist with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   The Commerce Department said starts of new homes and apartments
fell for the sixth straight month, down 2.6 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.15 million units.
   That was the lowest level since builders began 1.14 million
units at an annual rate in September 1982, two months before the
economy emerged from the 1981-82 recession. Starts have not fallen
for six consecutive months since June-November 1981.
   Even building permits, often a harbinger of future housing
activity, offered no solace. They fell 2.6 percent to an annual
rate of 1.08 million.
   For the first seven months of 1990, the building pace was 9.6
percent below the same period last year. During all of 1989, 1.38
million homes were built, still down from the current business
cycle peak of 1.81 million in 1986.
   Analysts blame the situation on credit restrictions following
the savings and loan crisis, a glut of unsold homes and high
vacancy rates in apartment buildings.
   David Berson, chief economist with the Federal National Mortgage
Association, said mortgage rates should decline later this year,
resulting in a slight increase in home sales and a subsequent
pickup in single-family starts at year end.
   John A. Tuccillo, chief economist with the National Association
of Realtors, also cited economic conditions that are causing a drop
in consumer confidence.
   ``People simply are uncertain about what lies ahead and are
pulling out of the market,'' he said.
   Berson said the multi-family sector has very high vacancy rates
because of overbuilding in the late 1980s.
   ``Those vacant units are going to have to be worked off before
builders decide to start increasing the pace of multi-family
building,'' he said.
   Construction of single-family units fell 1.4 percent to an
annual rate of 873,000 units in July following a 1.3 percent
decline a month earlier. Multi-family starts were down 6.5 percent
to an annual rate of 275,000 units after a 4.9 percent drop in June.
   Starts slumped in all regions except the West, where
construction jumped 8.7 percent to an annual rate of 317,000 units.
   But starts fell sharply in the South, down 6.7 percent to an
annual rate of 498,000 units. They were off 5.5 percent to 225,000
units in the Midwest and 5.3 percent to 108,000 units in the
Northeast.

   The city and its police department have
been dismissed from a $28 million lawsuit filed by a man who spent
16 months in prison after he was wrongfully convicted of a 1982
armed robbery.
   Lenell Geter, an aerospace engineer formerly employed by
E-Systems, filed a $28 million lawsuit against the city, the police
department and Lt. Jim Fortenberry after he fought successfully to
overturn a 1982 armed robbery conviction.
   ``As it stands now, the city owes Lenell Geter absolutely
nothing,'' City Attorney Dianne Callander said after U.S. District
Judge Barefoot Sanders issued his ruling Tuesday.
   Geter's case drew national attention when it was profiled on
CBS' ``60 Minutes.''
   Geter, who is black, was convicted by an all-white jury in
Dallas County and sentenced to life in prison in October 1982. He
served 16 months before his conviction was overturned and
prosecutors backed away from retrying him in 1985.
   All the claims in the case now have been dismissed except the
civil claims against Fortenberry.
   The lawsuit charged that Fortenberry ``set in motion'' a
conspiracy among area police departments when he received a tip
that Geter was two miles from the scene of an August 1982 robbery
of a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Greenville in suburban
Dallas.
   The tip developed into an investigation of Geter and five other
black engineers, who later joined Geter in his lawsuit.
   The charges against Geter were filed despite the fact that
fellow E-Systems employees said Geter was at work an hour's drive
away on the day of the Balch Springs robbery.
   Attempts today to contact Geter by telephone were unsuccessful.
He has since moved back to his home state of South Carolina.
   Sanders' decision came just hours before ``Guilty of
Innocence,'' the movie about Geter's case, was rebroadcast by CBS.

<HEAD>Lloyd's List Reports Shipping Trailing Off at Jordan's Port of
Aqaba</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Traffic is thinning at the Jordanian port of
Aqaba, Iraq's main outlet to the world, according to shipping
intelligence reported Thursday.
   Insurance rates, meanwhile, have risen for Persian Gulf and Red
Sea shipping because of the crisis in the region.
   The Lloyd's List International newspaper said Iraq's fleet of 80
tankers and cargo ships has stopped regular trading.
   With the United States pressing Jordan to join the international
embargo by closing Aqaba to Iraqi cargo, shipping owners said
traffic into the Red Sea port and the gulf will continue declining
as costs and physical risks increase.
   The United Nations ordered the sanctions after Iraq announced
the annexation of neighboring Kuwait on Aug 8. Jordan, Iraq's main
Arab ally, has not committed itself to the embargo.
   President Bush has threatened to block Aqaba to Iraqi trade if
Iraq continues getting supplies from Jordan. He met Thursday in
Maine with Jordan's King Hussein.
   John Prescott, a shipping correspondent for Lloyd's List
International, said latest information was that there was no
shipping in Kuwaiti or Iraqi ports and that Aqaba activity was
trailing off.
   Aqaba-bound ships loaded with cargo before the crisis began are
obliged to deliver it unless a warship bars their way, said Peter
Tudball, vice chairman of the Baltic Exchange, the international
organization that matches ship owners with freight movers.
   Ship owners have refused cargo destined for Aqaba since Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, he said.
   There are usually 20 to 30 sizable ships in Aqaba on any given
day. But ``There certainly wouldn't be anyone, at the moment,
willing to take any cargo into Aqaba,'' he said.
   ``All ship owners will be wary... they don't want an Exocet
missile through their ships. That limits their trading
possibilities in the future.''
   Another reason is cost. Marine underwriters at the Lloyd's of
London insurance market have suggested insurers charge an
additional 1 percent of total insured value on ships going into the
Arabian Gulf Coast.
   Lloyd's does not give money figures. Tudball gave an example,
saying operators of a supertanker worth $80 million would be
charged an extra $800,000 for up to seven days in the crisis zone.
   Leading shipping firms have added a $200 surcharge for each
container on ships going to Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, said Jeff Barlax,
a spokesman for P and O Containers, Ltd., a British shipping
concern that is part of the Trio consortium of European, Japanese
and U.S. lines.
   Barlax said surcharges are being considered for ships going to
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf.
   Tudball thinks few ships will break sanctions and risk losing
their insurance. ``In life you always do get pirates, and if the
right money is there, ships will go in. But they will be very few
and far between,'' he said.
   The stoppage in Iraqi shipping was ``an indication that the
moves to isolate the country commercially are starting to take
effect,'' Lloyd's List International reported.
   The newspaper said there was no record of three-quarters of the
Iraqi fleet entering port since Aug. 2.
   ``The Iraqi fleet, especially its 20 tankers, will find it
difficult to pick up cargo while the crisis continues,'' Lloyd's
List said, ``and it is likely that without the prospect of
receiving cargoes, the Iraqis have decided it is pointless to send
their ships into `unfriendly' ports.''
   It said Iraq's isolation would be a problem for its ships, which
depend on foreign repair facilities.

   It's bad enough when out-of-staters
confuse this Eastern Panhandle town with the state capitol of
Charleston.
   Now 14 new road signs direct West Virginia drivers down the road
to Berrysville, Va., instead of Berryville, thanks to a spelling
error by the state Division of Highways.
   ``Maybe they don't spell as well as we do,'' said Billy
Thompson, president of the Berryville Chamber of Commerce.
   Ken Kobesky, director of the DOH's engineering department, said
the letters can be removed and the signs corrected.
   ``We don't want to offend anyone with the spelling,'' Kobesky
said.
   But Berryville should be used to such mistakes. It is the county
seat of Clarke County, Va., named for the Lewis and Clark
expedition, Thompson said.
   What about the extra ``e''?
   The Virginia Assembly spelled Clark wrong when it incorporated
the county, Thompson said.

   A federal jury today began deliberating the
cases of three former Northwest Airlines pilots accused of being
drunk when they flew a passenger plane from North Dakota to
Minnesota.
   U.S. District Judge James Rosenbaum instructed the jury to
consider separately whether the defendants are guilty of operating
an aircraft while under the influence of alcohol.
   Rosenbaum said jurors should consider this definition of being
under the influence of alcohol: When a person is so affected by
alcohol that he lacks ``clearness of intellect and control of
himself that he would otherwise have.''
   Jurors got the case after hearing closing arguments and
rebuttals Wednesday and today.
   In their closing arguments, defense attorneys said their clients
may have used poor judgment by drinking the night before flying a
Boeing 727, but they are innocent of flying-while-intoxicated
charges.
   ``It's not against the law to drink alcohol and fly a plane.
Maybe it should be,'' Peter Wold, attorney for Capt. Norman Lyle
Prouse, said in closing arguments Wednesday. ``It's only against
the law if you are under the influence ... and there is not one
piece of evidence suggesting he was.''
   Prouse, 51, of Conyers, Ga., 1st Officer Robert Kirchner, 36, of
Highland Ranch, Colo., and flight engineer Joseph Balzer, 35, of
Antioch, Tenn., have been on trial since July 25 on charges of
operating an aircraft while under the influence of alcohol.
   Closing arguments for Balzer were scheduled today in U.S.
District Court.
   According to undisputed testimony, Balzer and Kirchner shared
beer from at least six pitchers and Prouse consumed 15 to 20 rum
and colas at a lounge in Moorhead, Minn., on March 7. A waitress
testified that Balzer and Kirchner left about 10:30 p.m. and Prouse
left about 11:30 p.m. Six hours later, on March 8, the trio flew a
Boeing 727 with 91 passengers from Fargo, N.D., to the Twin Cities.
   ``It was stupid of him (Kirchner) to stay in the bar,'' defense
attorney William Mauzy said.
   But Mauzy cautioned: ``Don't condemn them because they were in a
bar, because that's not what they are charged with.''
   The case marks the U.S. Justice Department's first prosecution
under a 1988 federal law prohibiting operation of a common carrier
while under the influence of alcohol. The law doesn't specify a
blood-alcohol content for pilots. To return guilty verdicts, jurors
must conclude the pilots were impaired.
   Defense attorneys said the smoothness of the flight showed the
pilots were not impaired.
   ``There wasn't anything about that flight that wasn't perfect,''
Mauzy said. ``That's the best evidence you need to know about
whether Bob Kirchner was impaired.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth de la Vega said in her closing
argument that the pilots were able to handle Flight 650 because it
was routine. She reminded jurors that a Northwest pilot called as a
defense witness described flying as ``hours of boredom punctuated
by minutes of terror.''
   ``These three defendants were not capable to respond to those
minutes of terror,'' de la Vega said.
   In tests about two hours after the flight landed, Kirchner
showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.06 percent, Balzer showed
0.08 percent, and Prouse showed 0.13 percent. Prouse's
blood-alcohol level was more than the legal limit for driving a car
in many states, which is 0.10 percent.
   The federal felony carries a maximum 15 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
   The three pilots were fired for violating Northwest's 12-hour
prohibition against drinking before flying.
   In a report in the New England Journal of Medicine today, two
doctors said even a little alcohol can hinder pilots' ability to
fly, and recommended that federal rules bar pilots from taking the
controls until at least 12 hours after their last drink.
   ``The weight of the evidence suggests that even small amounts of
alcohol can have a profoundly negative effect on flight safety,''
said Drs. Jack G. Modell and James M. Mountz of the University of
Michigan.

<HEAD>Stolen Mower Helped Retarded Man Lead Independent Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A thief took something more important than
just a lawn mower when he took Danny Riddle's used grass cutter.
   The machine was Riddle's primary tool in leading an independent
life, the retarded man said Wednesday.
   Police said the mower was stolen from his front porch late
Monday or early Tuesday.
   Riddle, 37, has worked hard to live independently, mowing lawns
at $15 to $20 each.
   ``This has burned me up (that) somebody stole a lawn mower from
me. Somebody knew where I live,'' Riddle said.
   His mother said the crime also has taught him a difficult lesson
about life's bad side.
   ``He does try so hard to be independent, and he works so hard in
his yard work,'' said Mildred Riddle of Midland. ``To think that
somebody would steal it makes me furious.''
   Riddle has another mower he uses as a backup, but he says it
doesn't work as well and some customers prefer he not use it at all.
   ``It's not a very good one,'' his mother said. ``It's probably
not going to last very long. He's still going to have to have
another mower, because he can't depend on that one.''
   Riddle formerly lived at the Abilene State School, but moved to
Austin, where he lives alone. His mother helps by making his house
payments and helped him buy the lawn mower. She said she cannot
afford to buy him another one.
   Riddle has been trying to find steadier work. He testified in
June before the Texas Board of Mental Health and Mental Retardation
about the need to fund job coaches for retarded people.
   Riddle said his business is going to suffer without the better
mower.
   ``This person who took it knows what he's doing and knows what
he's after,'' he said. ``This is the only thing I do. I'd like to
have my lawn mower back, because that makes money for me.''

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia today called for an
emergency meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to discuss how to deal with the market situation in light
of the Iraq-Kuwait crisis.
   Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said that the kingdom, along
with other unidentified members of the cartel, ``have asked for an
immediate OPEC meeting to discuss a unified decision on dealing
with conditions of the market.''
   No date or site for the meeting was announced.
   The minister, in a short official statement, denied the kingdom
had notified any of its customers of any cutbacks in oil supply for
September.
   Earlier in the day, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said Saudi
Arabia had notified U.S., European and Japanese oil companies of a
15 percent to 20 percent cutback in its oil supply for the month of
September.
   The Japanese officials said no reason was given for the reported
planned cutbacks, which followed reports that the Saudis would
boost daily output from 5.4 million barrels to more than 7 million
barrels to offset the loss of Iraqi oil being blocked by a
worldwide embargo. When Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 it increased
its share of the world's oil reserves to 20 percent.
   At the most recent OPEC meeting, which concluded in Geneva,
Switzerland, on July 27, the 13 OPEC ministers raised the target
price of oil $3 to $21 a barrel. They also agreed not to exceed the
production ceiling of 22.5 million barrels a day until the end of
the year.
   Earlier this year, the price declined to the low $16 range
partly because crude output by OPEC and other producers was
outpacing world demand.
   Prices began rising earlier this summer after the cartel reached
an agreement to restrain production. They shot sharply higher after
the invasion of Kuwait on speculation that Iraq might attack Saudi
Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter.
   At the OPEC meeting in July, Iraq accused Kuwait and the United
Arab Emirates of overproducing oil and thus driving down the price
for oil. Iraq, which relies heavily on oil sales to keep its
economy afloat, used the dispute over oil and territory to justify
its invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Takahiro Nakamae of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry's Petroleum Planning Department said earlier today that
even it the report of the planned Saudi oil cutback for September
is confirmed it will have ``little effect on Japan's overall oil
supply.''
   Japan, he noted, has 142 days worth of oil in reserve.
   Japan has agreed to participate in a full trade embargo on Iraq
and Kuwait, which were supplying 420,000 barrels a day, or 11
percent of Japan's oil imports. Japan is dependent on the Middle
East for nearly 70 percent of its oil, virtually all of which is
imported.
   But Nakamae said Japan can offset the Iraqi and Kuwait oil and
the reported planned cutback by the Saudis by importing more oil
from other sources.

<HEAD>MASH-Like Air Force Hospital Treating 15 Heat-Stress Cases Daily</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. military is treating about 15 cases
of minor heat stress a day as it rushes to finish a tent hospital
reminiscent of the television series ``MASH.''
   Already up and running at the air-conditioned, 50-bed facility
are a small ward for outpatient care and an overnight ward. A
two-bed operating room was expected to be ready by day's end.
   So similar is the ``air-transportable hospital'' to the TV
series that the facility's commander, Maj. Rich Williams, said that
doctors, nurses and other personnel have begun joking about their
resemblance to the show's cast.
   Williams told one pool reporter that he had become the group's
Col. Sherman Potter, the character who commanded the MASH unit.
   Others were starting to pick up nicknames as well, the major
said.
   So far, most people coming to the hospital for treatment have
been suffering from minor heat stress. The usual treatment is
rehydration by drinking water. In more severe cases, patients are
given intravenous injections of nutrient-laden fluids.
   Williams said there have been no reported cases of heat stroke,
a more serious ailment. He said the overnight ward had not been
needed, but added, ``I'm sure it will be by tonight.''
   In the outpatient ward, several patients were being treated for
heat stress. One was receiving intravenous fluids.
   ``This is your fault, colonel,'' the man joked to his commanding
officer, Col. John McBroom, who laughed.
   A 28-year-old sergeant from Sarasota, Fla., said he had felt ill
after several hours of swinging a sledgehammer while setting up
tents in near 100-degree weather.
   ``I didn't take enough breaks at all,'' he said.
   U.S. troops are being told to drink at least six gallons of
water a day but even with that several interviewed this week have
said they are finding it impossible to adjust to the desert heat.
   ``We'll never get used to it. All we can do is drink and drink
and complain a bit,'' an Air Force captain said Thursday.
   ``If you asked everybody, they'd all say we'd rather go home but
we've got a job to do,'' said an Air Force sergeant.
   McBroom visited the tent site and told the men and women to
knock off work until nightfall, when temperatures generally drop
into the 80s.
   ``Ninety-five percent of them will go so hard at it, even in
this heat, that you have to pull them back,'' the colonel said.
   Also receiving treatment at the hospital was a tank gunner from
the Army's 82nd Airborne who had aggravated a finger fracture and
an air Force colonel who had popped a dental crown and was having
it repaired by a dentist.
   The hospital's chief nurse, Lt. Col. Susan Helm of Goodrich,
Mich., said the hospital staff expected that they would eventually
have to treat patients with diseases related to food, water and
improper sanitation.
   Williams said that Hepatitis A and some parasitic infections are
common to Saudi Arabia and that malaria was a concern in some parts
of the kingdom.
   The hospital is near an air-conditioned tent city being built to
accommodate at least 1,100 men and women of the 1st Tactical
Fighter Wing from Langley Air Force Base, Va. Already operating is
a field kitchen, which served 500 for breakfast Thursday.

<HEAD>Pentagon to Deploy 45,000 Marines to Persian Gulf Region</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 2nd graf, In Washington ... to UPDATE with State
Department report on Americans in Kuwait; Bush-Hussein meeting
still going on and no post-meeting statements anticipated</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Pentagon sources today disclosed
plans to deploy 45,000 Marines to the inflamed Persian Gulf region
to supplement the thousands of Army, Navy and Air Force troops
already committed. President Bush met with King Hussein of Jordan
as tensions heightened.
   In Washington, the State Department said the 2,500 Americans in
Kuwait were given two hours by the Iraqi military today to move to
a hotel to protect them against ``unspecified threats.'' The U.S.
ambassador in Kuwait protested the order and the State Department
said, ``Obviously, the situation is of concern to us.''
   The size of the Marine deployment became known as one source
said the president had given naval commanders in the Persian Gulf
permission to use ``minimum force'' to halt shipments to and from
Iraq in enforcement of a U.N.-backed trade embargo.
   Those steps could include attempting to block the ship's passage
or firing a warning shot across the bow, a senior administration
source in Washington said Wednesday night. The president's message
was expected to be sent today to the U.S. Navy fleet in Middle East
waters.
   While the orders were going out to the fleet, Air Force
officials discussed the maneuverings in the skies above the Middle
East. Air Force crew chiefs in Saudi Arabia said Iraqi planes have
turned and flown away several times after weapons systems radar
aboard U.S. jets have locked onto them.
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said today that Iraq
has continued to increase its armed forces in Kuwait and that
intelligence reports estimate their number at 160,000. He said
there has been no major change in the character of the forces,
which the Pentagon earlier described as having a defensive
appearance.
   The size of the Marine deployment was disclosed by officials
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In a separate interview with The AP, Gen. John Dailey, assistant
commandant of the Marine Corps, said the service has sent a
``substantial armada'' of assault troops _ the largest since the
Vietnam War.
   ``We don't just arrive,'' the four-star general said in an
interview. ``We're there to stay for a fairly lengthy period.''
   Bush, back at his Maine vacation home after a 24-hour trip to
Washington, was expected to press Hussein to cooperate with the
international effort to force Saddam to roll back his invading Army
from Kuwait.
   Hussein made his trip to the United States in his self-appointed
role as mediator in the two-week crisis, and is believed to be
carrying a private message from Iraq's president to Bush.
   But the public announcement from Iraq during the day was hardly
conciliatory. President Saddam Hussein warned that if there is
military confrontation, ``you will receive thousands of Americans
wrapped in sad coffins.''
   The crisis began two weeks ago when Saddam sent his tank army
into Kuwait, swiftly overrunning resistance and seizing control of
the nation's large oil reserves. American officials said
intelligence information showed Saddam was then positioning his
troops as if to invade Saudi Arabia, and Bush responded with the
largest American military deployment since Vietnam, and an effort
to organize an international trade blockade.
   Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Mohamed Al-Mashat, said
today he didn't know whether Saddam was proposing any specific
steps, but said of the message: ``It's a call for peace, peace with
justice.''
   ``I don't know really the content of it, but there were
principles that were enunciated by our president in his
initiative,'' Al-Mashat said on the Fox Morning News. ``Maybe there
are some practical steps to be implemented.''
   The White House, piqued at the king's efforts to defend Saddam,
downplayed any expectations of a breakthrough in the crisis ignited
by Iraq's blitzkrieg Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The White House said Bush would meet later today with Saudi
Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, and the Saudi
ambassador to the United States, Prince Bander bin Sultan.
   The instruction on interdiction of Iraqi ships described a
step-by-step approach under which commanders should first request
ships to halt and seek their cooperation before taking any more
aggressive steps, the administration source said.
   The instruction ``will tell them to use the minimum force
necessary,'' said the source, adding that might include steps taken
to disable a ship so that it couldn't continue on its way.
   American fighter jet crews in Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, are
describing maneuverings in the air along the Kuwait-Saudi border
involving U.S. and Iraqi planes. Several crew chiefs said Iraqi
fighters turned in retreat after the weapons systems aboard
American jets locked onto the Iraqi targets.
   ``One of my pilots told me they turn and run as soon as the
radar locks on,'' one crew chief said. ``There's been a little
cat-and-mouse, but when the weapons lock on, they're gone,''
another said. ``They don't want to play with us,'' one said of the
Iraqis.
   Bush, on the golf course Wednesday after returning to Maine from
a military briefing at the Pentagon, said, ``Just wait and see what
happens'' when asked what he expected from the meeting with the
Jordanian monarch.
   Bush, addressing Pentagon employees after a briefing by his top
generals, expressed his determination to enforce the U.N. embargo
by land and sea.
   ``Together we must ensure that no goods get in, and that not one
drop of oil gets out,'' said Bush. The president said Tuesday that
could mean shutting down the Jordanian port of Aqaba if goods keep
flowing into Iraq through that port on the Red Sea.
   Defense Department sources said 22 F-117A stealth fighters were
leaving today for the Persian Gulf. The radar-evading jets saw
their first combat in Panama last December. The aircraft carrier
John F. Kennedy and its eight-ship battle group left for the Middle
East on Wednesday.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration
has not yet decided whether it must call up reserves to boost the
fast-paced U.S. military buildup in the Saudi desert and Persian
Gulf.

   Federal agents today arrested six Kentucky
law enforcement officers, including four county sheriffs, on
extortion and drug conspiracy charges.
   Sheriffs in Wolfe, Lee, Owsley and Breathitt counties were
arrested this morning along with a deputy sheriff in Wolfe County
and the Beattyville chief of police, Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob
Trevey said.
   The six are named in a 42-count indictment unsealed today. The
indictment charges a conspiracy to extort money and protect drug
shipments in eastern Kentucky. All six are also charged with
conspiracy to traffic in cocaine and marijuana and trafficking in
more than 220 pounds of cocaine.
   Arrested were Wolfe County Sheriff Lester Drake, Lee County
Sheriff Johnny Mann, Owsley County Sheriff Billy McIntosh,
Breathitt County Sheriff Dean Spencer, Beattyville Police Chief
Omer Noe and Wilson Stone, a deputy in Wolfe County.
   Trevey said the first count of the indictment charges a
conspiracy to extort money and the other 41 counts involved
specific instances of extortion. He declined to provide further
details of the charges.
   The arrested officials were expected to enter pleas in U.S.
District Court in Lexington later in the day.
   Trevey said the charges stemmed from an investigation by two
undercover FBI agents who posed as Chicago businessmen. The
indictment said the agents posed as operators of a marijuana and
cocaine smuggling ring that moved drugs from Texas to Kentucky.
   The agents told the law enforcement officers that they
distributed the drugs in West Virginia, New York and Tennessee, the
indictment said.
   As part of the sting, the indictment said, the officers accepted
money from the agents in return for protection and aid from law
enforcement agencies.
   The indictment said Mann accepted about $37,500, Drake was paid
some $17,000 and shared another payment of approximately $4,000
with Stone. McIntosh, Noe and Spencer accepted about $12,000,
$5,000 and $8,000 respectively, according to the indictment.
   According to the indictment, the police protection included
being allowed to fly loads of cocaine to the area. The sting
operation began Aug. 2, 1989 and continued through at least July 27.
   The officers also agreed to allow distribution of the drugs to
the other states and to inform the undercover agents about any
state or local investigation of the fake smuggling operation, the
indictment said.
   Officials answering the phone in the sheriff's offices in
Breathitt and Wolfe counties declined to comment today. There was
no answer at the sheriff's office in Owsley County.

<HEAD>Air Pollution Still Plagues Major Cities</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Ozone Table, BC-Carbon Monoxide Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than half the U.S. population still lives
in cities plagued by too much smog, and one third in areas with
dangerously high carbon monoxide, the Environmental Protection
Agency said Thursday.
   Most major cities _ 119 in all _ flunked air quality checks for
at least several days during the past three years, and some such as
Los Angeles and New York failed much more frequently, the EPA said..
   Eighteen cities violated standards for both smog and carbon
monoxide, meaning in most cases they have major pollution problems
in both summer and winter months.
   ``These lists demonstrate the magnitude of the air pollution
problem still remaining in this country,'' said EPA Deputy
Administrator F. Henry Habicht.
   The total number of cities was down five from last year, taking
into account cities added to or dropped from the lists.
   But Habicht said 133 million people still live in areas
exceeding the smog standard and almost 78 million are in areas that
are over the carbon monoxide limit.
   The EPA listed 96 areas where monitoring of the air showed that
smog, or ozone, levels were too high more than three times since
1987. Anything over 0.12 parts per million is considered a
violation of federal standards. The lists didn't say how far over
that level the cities went.
   The worst area, at least from the standpoint of number of days
of violation, was the Los Angeles-Anaheim-Riverside area of
California, with 137 days, followed by Bakersfield, Calif., with 44
days and New York City with 17.
   Another list included 41 areas where carbon monoxide levels
exceeded the limit of 9 parts per million on two or more days in
either 1988 or 1989.
   Los Angeles led again, with 71 days, followed by Spokane, Wash.,
with 37 days, Oshkosh, Wis., with 32, the area of Steubenville,
Ohio and Weirton, W.Va., with 31, and then New York and Las Vegas,
Nev., with 26.
   Smog is primarily a summertime problem, caused by the
interaction of the more intense sunlight with chemicals in the air.
Carbon monoxide becomes more difficult to control in the winter
when temperature inversions keep more pollutants in the lower
atmosphere.
   Both can cause health problems, ranging from eye irritation to
heart ailments.
   ``Most major cities in this country are still not meeting at
least one of these standards,'' said Warren Freas, spokesman for
the EPA's air quality office.
   The lists, which include complex data on the degree to which
each area is violating the standards, are used by the EPA to
determine whether state clean air plans can be approved or if new
actions must be taken. These can include requirements for increased
automobile inspections or less-polluting gasoline mixtures.
   The EPA said it would use the lists to determine any new
requirements that cities must meet under the Clean Air Act being
worked out by a House-Senate conference committee.
   The 18 areas on both lists include the nation's largest urban
areas. More than a third are in California: Los Angeles, San
Francisco-Oakland, Fresno, Modesto, Sacramento, San Diego and
Stockton.
   The others are New York; Boston; Hartford, Conn.; Baltimore;
Philadelphia; Washington; Greensboro-Winston Salem, N.C.; Memphis,
Tenn.; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; Cleveland and El Paso, Texas.
   Eight areas were dropped from the smog list from last year:
Columbia, S.C.; Jacksonville, Fla., Lafayette, Ind.; Phoenix;
Huntsville, Ala.; Anderson, S.C.; Tulsa, Okla., and Portland, Ore.
Three were added: Smyth County, Va.; the Johnson
City-Kingsport-Bristol area in Tennessee and Virginia, and
Evansville, Ind.
   Seven areas are newly meeting carbon monoxide standards:
Manchester, N.H.; Oklahoma City; St. Louis; Great Falls, Mont.;
Greeley, Colo.; Salt Lake City, and Yakima, Wash.
   New to the list of violators: Syracuse, N.Y.; Philadelphia;
Duluth, Minn.; and Stockton, Calif.

<HEAD>Americans, Britons Ordered to Assemble in Kuwaiti Hotels</HEAD>

   Iraqi military authorities in Kuwait today instructed all
Americans and Britons to assemble at hotels in the emirate. U.S.
officials said the order was unjusfified. Britain condemned it as
``grave and sinister.''
   ``What we fear is that they will be interned somewhere, most
likely in Iraq,'' Britain's Foreign Office minister, William
Waldegrave, said in London.
   The U.S. State Department said the 2,500 Americans in Kuwait
were given two hours to move to a hotel to protect them against
``unspecified threats.''
   The International Hotel, where the Americans were told to
gather, is opposite the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait city.
   Initially, the Iraqi authorities told the U.S. ambassador in
Kuwait, Nathaniel Howell, that the Americans should go to central
points, such as hotels. ``But then it became clear they meant the
Kuwaiti International,'' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
said in Washington.
   Howell protested the order as unjustified and impratical.
   Britain, whose 4,000 nationals in Kuwait were ordered to go to
the Regency Hotel, has contacted its European Community partners
and other allies to see if similar demands had been made on other
foreign communities in Kuwait.
   The reports came as thousands of foreigners streamed into Jordan
from Iraq, including a few Westerners, a senior Jordanian official
said. But Baghdad refused to allow most Americans, West Europeans
and Japanese to leave.
   Those crossing into Jordan included three U.S. citizens of
Indian origin, three Bangladeshis with dual British and Bangladeshi
nationality and a Frenchwoman, according to a senior Jordanian
security official.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Jordan said the mission was aware of
the Jordanian official's statement, but did not know anything about
the Americans who reportedly crossed the border.
   Iraqi authorities said the order that Britons and American
assemble was given for their own safety, Waldegrave said. But he
said if internment is Iraq's intention, Baghdad should ``draw
back'' and reconsider.
   He said the British Embassy had been instructed to send a
diplomat to the Regency hotel in Kuwait city. Diplomats were not
among those ordered to assemble, and no deadline was given, the
minister said.
   Earlier today, Britain's Foreign Office had said a convoy of 28
cars carrying 112 Britons had left Kuwait for Baghdad. They were
mainly dependents and non-essential staff in the embassy, and the
wives and children of a British military liaison team and a few
members of the British community, it said.
   Meanwhile, the Soviet news agency Tass said the first group of
230 Soviet evacuees from Kuwait was in Baghdad awaiting charter
flights out. But Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh
told a briefing that the group would be transferred to the Soviet
Union via the Iraq-Iran border.
   The Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations said today that his
country will not give top priority to the evacuation of Westerners
because of threats from abroad. Dr. Abdul Amir al-Nbarie said in a
BBC radio interview that Iraq was subject to ``tremendous threats
and intimidation'' from other countries.
   Overall, more than 2 million foreigners were trapped in Iraq and
Kuwait after Iraq invaded its oil-rich neighbor on Aug. 2 and later
annexed it. The foreigners include 2,500 Americans in Kuwait and
500 in Iraq.
   Waldegrave said Britain was protesting to authorities in Baghdad
and elsewhere and would raise the issue at the United Nations.
   ``I hope that these reports and the storm of protest that will
break around the head of Iraq if she pursues any policy of
interning people will make her draw back from any such policy if
that is what she contemplates,'' he said.
   An emergency message was broadcast on a British Broadcasting
Corp. channel passing the Iraqi order to the 4,000 Britons living
in Kuwait to assemble at the Regency. The radio message advised the
Britons to be prepared for a prolonged stay by taking supplementary
food and a minimum kit.
   Waldegrave called the order ``a further example of the duplicity
of the Iraqi regime'' which earlier had referred to the foreigners
as ``guests.'' He said the Iraqi order came without warning and
contained ``a clear threat.''
   While most Westerners are free to travel within Iraq and Kuwait,
a group of 36 Americans and two Britons has been restricted to a
luxury hotel in Baghdad, according to ABC News. They had taken from
Kuwait city to Baghdad.
   ABC said the detainees in the hotel are ``being treated rather
well,'' spending much of their day at the hotel pool, but ``seem to
be under enormous tension'' and are afraid they will be stuck in
Iraq until the crisis ends.
   The network said an Iraqi monitored conversations with the
Americans in the hotel, but one of the Americans said, ``Look, we
want you to tell the president of the United States that we think
he's doing the right thing.''

<HEAD>FEC Seeks Comments On Plan To Ban Foreign PACs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Election Commission on Thursday
asked for input on a proposal to ban political action committees of
companies at least half owned by foreigners.
   The 5-0 commission vote came several weeks after the Senate
voted 73-27 to include a similar proposal in a campaign finance
reform bill.
   The FEC plan, by Commissioner John Warren McGarry, establishes a
60-day public comment period, ending Oct. 12. The commission set an
Oct. 31 public hearing.
   Under the proposed rule, any corporation with 50 percent or more
foreign ownership would be defined as a foreign national unable to
participate in federal elections. Subsidiaries in the United States
failing to qualify would not be allowed to contribute to campaigns
or spend money on any federal election.
   The commission also sought comments on how it should enforce the
rule and on any other issues involving participation by foreign
nationals in federal elections.
   Currently, the FEC allows U.S. subsidiaries of foreign firms to
have PACs, provided the foreign owners do not control or direct
operation of the committees.
   Supporting the proposal were Commission Chairwoman Lee Ann
Elliott, and commissioners Thomas J. Josefiak, Scott Thomas, and
Danny Lee McDonald.
   The Senate language, sponsored by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
was approved as part of a bill that would impose spending ceilings
on candidates and also try to eliminate PACs altogether.
   Bentsen said his amendment was intended to give ``legislative
underpinning'' to the FEC in case the Senate drops the proposed ban
on PACs in conference _ or if the prohibition is ruled
unconstitutional.
   Bentsen cited Congressional Research Service statistics showing
that PACs of foreign-owned companies contributed $2.8 million to
candidates in the 1988 elections, a 19 percent increase over 1986.
   The current system, he said, allows foreign-owned companies to
pressure employees of their U.S. subsidiaries ``to use the PAC
muscle in ways acceptable to the corporate masters in London,
Frankfurt or Tokyo.''

   President F.W. de Klerk and Nelson
Mandela held emergency talks today on ways of ending savage
hand-to-hand fighting between rival black factions that has left at
least 148 people dead in five days.
   The violence between Zulus and Xhosas spilled into Soweto today
when hundreds of Zulus armed with spears and axes attacked
terrified passengers at a train station. Screaming people were
pulled from the platform and several were hacked to death and many
injured, eyewitnesses said.
   Police said at least six more people had died today and 84 were
injured, at least 15 of them critically. Police feared new violence
would flare tonight when rival bands were expected to seek revenge
killings.
   The fighting spilled into central Johannesburg at one point when
two groups fought at the main city railway station, leaving one man
dead and six injured, police said. Thousands of blacks armed with
spears, axes and several guns have been battling in townships east
of Johannesburg since Sunday.
   Moira Smith, who saw children fleeing from burning houses that
had been attacked, said: ``There was blood on their clothes. I will
never forget the absolutely haunting look of terror in their
eyes,'' she said.
   De Klerk and Mandela held a meeting in Pretoria to discuss ways
to end the killing and considered several options, according to a
statement. De Klerk said he would take action, but the statement
gave no details.
   The ANC issued a statement appealing for an end to the fighting,
saying people were butchering each other ``like beasts.'' The
statement urged all blacks to unite, warning that ``hatred is being
sown everywhere.''
   The fighting pits Xhosa supporters of Mandela's African National
Congress against Zulus of the conservative Inkatha movement.
   Heavily-armed police in trucks and vans roared through
violence-wracked area at high speed for hours, randomly firing tear
gas shells at groups of blacks. Youths who tried to block roads
with burning tires were dispersed.
   At one point, dozens of police fired tear gas to disperse
several thousand armed Zulus and Xhosas who confronted each other
after the killings at the train station, witnesses said.
   ``The Zulus are attacking the people and killing everyone,''
said one man, who refused to be identified.
   Journalists were made to leave the area by armed police. Police
Capt. John Paxton claimed journalists were helping incite violence,
but he refused to provide evidence.
   A police spokesman, who declined to be named, said other
townships hit by fighting earlier in the week were quiet today.
Police in armored vehicles were roaming streets to prevent
violence, he said.
   Besides the 148 people killed since Sunday in four townships
around Johannesburg, police said hundreds of people had been
injured, but they had no overall figures. Police also reported
arrests, but declined to give any figures.
   The fighting pits mostly Xhosa supporters of the African
National Congress against the conservative Zulu Inkatha movement.
The independent South African Press Association said the township
fighting was the worst in many years.
   ``We are fighting for our nation. We are fighting to protect
Zulus only,'' said a combatant who appeared on government-run
television late Wednesday.
   Armed bands of Zulus attacked several shantytowns Wednesday in
Thokoza, Katlehong and Vosloorus townships. The bands set fire to
houses and attacked fleeing residents with spears, pangas, knives
and other weapons.
   One resident, who did not want to be named, said he saw ``more
than 2,000'' Zulus armed with guns, spears, butcher's knives and
axes attack a squatter camp at Crossroads in Katlehong.
   ``I saw mothers with babies on their backs running past my house
... I didn't know what was happening and then I saw the Zulus,'' he
said.
   Eyewitnesses said the Zulus searched houses, hunting out and
attacking Xhosa residents. Some residents tried to flee to a nearby
swamp, but were chased down and hacked to death. Other people were
burned to death in their blazing houses.
   Hundreds of people whose homes were burned gathered for safety
in large groups Wednesday night with the remains of their
possessions. The South African Red Cross said it was trying to set
up refugee camps to house them.
   Police seized hundreds of knives, spears and other weapons and
reported finding a chest containing AK-47 assault rifles and
grenades. A large police truck piled high with confiscated weapons
was seen leaving Katlehong.
   The fighting started Sunday after a minor clash.
   The fighting between the ANC and Inkatha began spilling into the
townships around Johannesburg in recent weeks. Violence between the
two groups had been concentrated in Natal province in the past.
   The two groups oppose apartheid, but are divided by leadership
rivalry, tribal loyalty and differing visions of a future South
Africa.
   More than 5,000 blacks have died since 1985 in fighting between
Inkatha and ANC supporters in Natal.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Two Black Infants Can Be With Affluent White Couple</HEAD>

   A judge on Thursday granted a black woman's
wish that her two young girls live with an affluent, suburban white
couple, ending social workers' plans to place the children with
black, inner city foster parents.
   Milwaukee County Children's Court Judge Ronald S. Goldberger
ordered that the woman's 5-month-old daughter remain in the care of
foster parents Beverly and David Cox of Delafield, a suburb about
30 miles west of Milwaukee.
   The judge also ordered the woman's 16-month-old daughter moved
there.
   The Milwaukee County Department of Social Services wanted to put
the girls in black foster homes in the inner city to keep them in
the same social and economic environment as their mother.
   The judge made the ruling after social worker Bonnie Finkler
told the court her agency had changed its position and agreed to
drop plans to take the 5-month-old child from the Coxes and place
her with a black family.
   ``This case is unique because of the close friendship that has
developed between the Coxes and the natural family,'' Ms. Finkler
said. ``We are hopeful that this relationship will prove to be an
asset in reuniting mother and daughters as soon as possible.''
   The children were taken from their mother earlier this year
after social workers determined the woman was unable to ``maintain
a proper home'' for them, said Jeff Aikin, a spokesman for the
department.
   Initial placements were made before social workers fully
reviewed the circumstances. The younger child was placed with the
Coxes. The older one was put at a different white home but later
moved to a black foster mother's home.
   The 30-year-old mother, who hasn't been identified in court to
protect her children's identities, has not contested the removal of
her children, but she petitioned the court to overrule the social
workers on relocation.
   The Coxes joined the children's mother in protesting the social
workers' decision, arguing race should not affect any foster
placement decisions.
   But Goldberger ruled the couple had no legal standing and that
only the mother could appeal.
   Jim Ries, a foster care official with the Department of Social
Services, said the older child will be placed in the Cox home as
soon as possible to reunite the two sisters.
   ``It'll happen right away, but it'll happen in a way that will
make it easiest for the kids,'' Ries said.
   The black foster family recently asked the department to
withdraw as a placement alternative for the youngest girl, ``due
primarily to the publicity surrounding the case,'' Ms. Finkler said.
   Mrs. Cox said she was pleased with the judge's ruling.
   ``This will be very nice to have this out of the way, and have
all our families back to normal,'' she said.
   But she added that the children's mother needs counseling that
should begin right away to expedite a reunion with her four
children. The woman's two older children have been living with
relatives.
   The mother has not been receiving counseling since the placement
dispute began, Mrs. Cox said.
   Michael Vruno, a lawyer appointed by the court to represent the
children, had first advocated placement with a black family. He
changed his mind, but said race was not his primary concern.
   ``The concern that I had about these two children living with
the Coxes is that they are quite a distance from the mother,''
Vruno said.
   He said he was convinced the Coxes would continue to provide
transportation so the children could visit their mother, although
they have no legal duty to do so.
   Vruno said he believes the Department of Social Services should
consider race in adoption cases and permanent foster placements.

   The 2,500 Americans in Kuwait were given two
hours today to move to a hotel to protect them against
``unspecified threats.'' A senior U.S. official said the Iraqis
implied they would round up Americans who didn't cooperate.
   The order by Iraqi military authorities was immediately
protested by U.S. Ambassador Nathaniel Howell as unjustified and
impractical, but Americans were told of the ``request,'' said
Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman.
   The Iraqis ``implied'' in the meeting with Howell that military
authorities ``would go out and find'' Americans who didn't
voluntarily go to the International Hotel, the senior U.S. official
said.
   ``Obviously the situation is of concern to us,'' Boucher said,
but he again declined to describe the trapped Americans as hostages.
   A senior U.S. official, meanwhile, said the Iraqis have erected
an air-defense system around the Kuwaiti capital. He declined to
say whether the weapons included missiles, but the Soviets have
provided surface-to-air missiles to Iraq in the past.
   Iraqi military authorities also have instructed all Britons to
assemble at a hotel in a move the British Foreign Office condemned
as ``grave and sinister.''
   Only three Americans have managed to leave Iraqi-occupied Kuwait
in the last day or so, Boucher said. They made their way to
neighboring Jordan, although the State Department has cautioned
Americans it's too risky to try to leave the country.
   The International Hotel is opposite the U.S. embassy in Kuwait
City. Initially, Iraqi authorities told Ambassador Howell the
Americans should go to central points, such as hotels.
   ``But then it became clear they meant the Kuwaiti
International,'' Boucher said.
   ``We are not instructing them one way or another,'' Boucher
said, adding that Americans in Kuwait were bearing up well though
there were some food shortages.
   Howell was summoned about 3 a.m. EDT to a meeting with Iraqi
military authorities, Boucher said.
   ``He was asked to tell all Americans they had to move to a
central point. ... Iraqi authorities asked for compliance within
two hours,'' Boucher said. ``They explained that the order was a
result of concerns about the protection of the American community
from unspecified threats.''
   Howell, Boucher said, told the Iraqis the order was ``not only
an impractical impossibility, but he also asked for an explanation
and reminded the Iraqi authorities of their responsibility for the
safety of Americans.''
   Boucher said Howell ``made clear that he could inform the
Americans of the request, but that he had no power to order them to
move. The embassy has contacted the American community ... to tell
them of this order.''
   Boucher said the ``action is totally uncalled for.''
   ``Most Americans would be better off in their homes,'' he said.
``Of course all would be better _ all Americans, all foreigners _
if they were allowed to leave and we will continue to work toward
that goal. If Americans wish to move to a hotel that's fine.''
   Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., said President Bush ``ought to tell
Iraq that he is sending a military air transport to Kuwait now to
pick up every American.''
   In an interview, Smith said: ``The president should also tell
them if those military transports are fired on or in any other way
impeded, or if any Americans are harmed by any elements, even
disconnected to any Iraqi troops in Kuwait, that the president of
the United States will consider it an act of war.''
   About 2,500 Americans have been trapped in the Persian Gulf
emirate since it was overrun by Iraqi forces two weeks ago.
   The Bush administration has responded to the invasion and
subsequent annexation of the oil-rich country by pouring tens of
thousands of troops into Saudi Arabia to protect its oilfields and
dispatching a nuclear-armed naval armada to the Gulf region.
   In addition to the Americans, there are about 3,000 Britons, 500
Italians and more than 450 Japanese stranded in Iraq and Kuwait.
   On Wednesday, an Iraqi foreign ministry officials referred to
the Americans in Kuwait as ``restrictees.''
   Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said
Wednesday in response that they should not be described as hostages
because they were not being held at gunpoint or mistreated and that
efforts were being made to arrange their departure.

   The Vietnam veteran general who is the
top-ranking U.S. military officer in Saudi Arabia and the Persian
Gulf area offered a bit of advice Thursday to younger troops eager
for battle with Iraq.
   Senior military officials who experienced Vietnam consider
combat ``man at his most ludicrous state'' and hope to avoid combat
here, Air Force Lt. Gen. Charles Horner said.
   Horner said today's troops are trained so hard and are so
prepared for combat that ``I can understand their eagerness.''
   But, ``if they stop and think, they realize war is a loser for
everyone,'' Horner told a visiting pool of American journalists.
   Horner is the top commander in the region and the top deputy to
Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the U.S. Central Command,
which controls U.S. forces in Southwest Asia.

   Horner said he was working ``very closely'' with Saudi military
officials but said many command functions remain to be worked out.
   At a lengthy question-and-answer session Thursday, he repeatedly
declined to answer queries about deployments and strategy, often
joking with reporters as he brushed aside their questions.
   Asked about accounts from Air Force crew chiefs who reported
that Iraqi planes had retreated after radar systems aboard U.S.
F-15 fighter jets locked on them, Horner rolled his eyes and smiled
before saying: ``I'd like to answer your question but I choose not
to.''

   The pool Thursday afternoon visited the Saudi air base where the
U.S. and Saudi air forces are conducting joint exercises with AWACS
reconnaissance planes.
   During a tour of one plane, U.S. Air Force officials said they
had been flying missions as long as 20 hours, which requires two
aerial refuelings.
   There is at least one AWACS in the air around the clock
monitoring Iraqi air activity. Each AWACS is escorted by F-15s,
according to Air Force Col. Tom Bliss.
   The AWACS crews often include both Saudi and American personnel,
he said.
   Bliss said the American planes have superior computers and other
equipment but that the Saudi AWACS have newer, more powerful
engines because they were purchased several years after the
American planes were built.

   One of the concerns that the folks back at the Pentagon had was
how the female soldiers assigned to Operation Desert Shield would
fare in Saudi Arabia's strict, male-dominated society.
   They needn't have worried, said several female crew members
assigned to a U.S. AWACS surveillance plane stationed in Saudi
Arabia.
   ``I thought I was going to run into problems with Saudi men,''
said a 21-year-old female surveillance technician from Michigan.
``But I've had no problems so far. All the Saudi men I've met have
been extremely polite.''
   That's not to say that no cultural misunderstandings exist.
   The technician said a Saudi businessman became so enamored of
another female crew member that ``he offered to buy her from the
male crewmen she was with for half a million dollars.''
   But Saudi crew members working on the AWACS planes say they have
no difficulty working with the young American women.
   ``It's fun working with them,'' a Saudi captain said. ``We enjoy
them. They are nice people.''

   Canada's military officials were caught off
guard by media reports that identified a half dozen jet fighters on
the ground in Saudi Arabia as Canadian planes.
   Not so, said Canadian Forces spokesman Lt.Cmdr. Kevin Carle in
Ottawa. ``I want to make it very clear there are no Canadian
fighters'' in Saudi Arabia, Carle said.
   Canada is sending three warships to the Persian Gulf to help
enforce United Nations-endorsed sanctions against Iraq, but no
troops or planes, he said Thursday.
   The case of mistaken identity came Tuesday, when Pentagon pool
reporters spotted half a dozen planes emblazoned with Canada's
distinctive maple leaf on the ground with U.S. fighters. The
reporters' Air Force escort said the planes were from Canada.
   The Air Force cleared up the mystery on Thursday, saying the
planes were British Tornadoes belonging to a Royal Air Force
squadron that uses the Canadian maple leaf as its insignia, a
tradition dating back to World War II.

   Rhythm and blues singer Curtis Mayfield remained
in critical but stable condition early Thursday, three days after
being hit by a lighting tower at a concert, a hospital
administrator said.
   Mayfield, 48, suffered head and neck trauma Monday night when
the tower landed on top of him as he took the outdoor stage at a
Brooklyn high school, authorities said. The tower was toppled by
sudden winds of up to 50 mph, police said.
   Mayfield, a founding member of The Impressions who also composed
the soundtrack for the movie ``Superfly,'' was being treated at
Kings County Hospital, said Clarence Vickers, a hospital
administrator.
   Vickers confirmed that Mayfield suffered paralysis, but declined
to specify its extent or whether it was considered permanent.
   Mayfield was a founding member of the early R&amp;B vocal group
whose hits included the classic civil rights anthem ``People Get
Ready.''
   In 1972, he composed the soundtrack for the movie ``Superfly,''
which contained the hits ``Freddie's Dead'' and the title track.

   Iraq's President Saddam Hussein said today he was praying for a
peaceful resolution to the Persian Gulf crisis but that if a
military confrontation erupts, it could result in ``thousands of
Americans wrapped in sad coffins.''
   Meanwhile, in a development U.S. officials described as
unjustified and Britain called ``grave and sinister,'' Iraqi
military authorities in Kuwait instructed all Americans and Britons
to assemble at two hotels in the emirate.
   ``What we fear is that they will be interned somewhere, most
likely in Iraq,'' Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave said
today in London.
   The U.S. State Department said the 2,500 Americans in Kuwait
were given two hours to move to the International Hotel opposite
the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait city to protect them against
``unspecified threats.''
   Also today, Pentagon sources disclosed plans to send 45,000
Marines to the gulf region to reinforce thousands of Army, Navy and
Air Force troops there.
   The developments came as President Bush met privately for two
hours with Jordan's King Hussein, who has tried to mediate the
showdown with Iraq.
   Talking to reporters after the meeting, Hussein denied reports
that he had carried a message from Saddam to Bush. He also denied
that Jordan was helping Iraq break an international boycott by
allowing Baghdad to export and import goods through Jordan's Red
Sea port of Aqaba.
   Neither Hussein nor Bush said what was discussed during the
meeting, and no statement about the meeting was issued.
   In his statement on Iraqi television _ billed as an open letter
to Bush _ Saddam repeatedly accused Bush of being a liar.
   ``You, president of the United States, have chosen to be a
liar,'' he said. ``You have lied to your people.''
   A day earlier, in a speech at the Pentagon, Bush had said Saddam
was a threat to Saudi Arabia _ which he has promised not to attack
_ because he lied about his intentions regarding Kuwait.
   In another development, Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted
travelers from Iraq as saying the attempt on Saddam's life led to
``large-scale'' arrests on Wednesday, including some close
associates of the Iraqi president, and a military clampdown in the
Iraqi capital.
   There was no independent confirmation of the report by the
government-run news agency, which did not say when the reported
attack on Saddam occurred. Asked about the report in Washington,
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said: ``At this point I
don't have any information like that.''
   After extending a peace offer to arch-enemy Iran on Wednesday,
Iraq expressed readiness to negotiate with U.S. officials, and the
Iraqi foreign minister said Baghdad would not initiate a war
against the United States.
   However, the minister, Tariz Aziz, added that if the Americans
``have come to initiate a war here, I think they will be sorry ...
because they will lose that war.'' He was interviewed on ABC's
``Nightline'' program.
   Aziz said Iraq has no intention of attacking Saudi Arabia, where
perhaps 20,000 U.S. troops already have been dispatched to counter
any further Iraqi seizure of the huge oil reserves in the Persian
Gulf.
   Bangladesh said Wednesday it would send soldiers to join
Egyptian, Syrian and Moroccan soldiers forming a multinational
force with American GIs to protect the Saudi kingdom.
   A new contingent of Egyptian troops left for Saudi Arabia today,
the Middle East News Agency reported. The agency did not say how
many soldiers were in the contingent, but military sources said it
was about 1,000 troops.
   The U.S. Navy is also at the forefront of a maritime barricade
of Iraq, aided by British, West German and Australian vessels.
   In other developments:
   _A respected leftist Beirut newspaper, As-Safir, today said all
14 Western hostages held in Lebanon, including six Americans, will
be freed by the end of the year. It quoted what it called
well-informed diplomatic sources as saying recent developments in
the gulf put the issue ``on a very hot burner'' and that contacts
were under way in concerned capitals, ``particularly Tehran.''
   _Two Americans, three Britons and a Frenchman were among
thousands of foreigners, mainly Arabs, who crossed into Jordan from
Iraq today, a senior Jordanian official reported. The Westerners
were the first to cross into Jordan since Saturday, when Baghdad
was reported to have banned Westerners from leaving. In addition to
the 2,500 Americans in Kuwait, about 500 are in Iraq.
   _Baghdad radio today quoted an unidentified Iraqi Air Force
spokesman as saying Iraq ``cannot guarantee the safety'' of any
foreign pilot who might be shot down over Iraqi territory because
of ``the rage the Iraqi people and the Arabs harbor for the
aggressive foreign intervention.''
   _Several U.S. Air Force crew chiefs said today Iraqi planes have
turned and flown away several times after weapons systems radar
aboard U.S. jets have locked onto the Iraqi targets. ``They don't
want to play with us,'' one crew chief said. ``If I were in a
Mirage and an F-15 locked onto me, I'd get out of there fast, too.''
   A senior U.S. administration source said Wednesday that Bush
authorized naval commanders to use ``the minimum force necessary''
to interdict shipments to and from Iraq.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush's
message was expected to be sent today to the U.S. Navy fleet in
Middle East waters.
   Bush told a military gathering at the Pentagon on Wednesday that
``no one should doubt our staying power'' in confronting Iraqi
expansionism. The American way of life is imperiled by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's growing control of Persian Gulf oil, he
said.
   The aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy and its eight-ship battle
group left Norfolk, Va., for the crisis area Wednesday, and
Pentagon officials said aircraft leaving soon would include F-117A
Stealth fighters. The U.S. Navy already has massed 27 ships,
including three carriers, in the gulf, the nearby Arabian Sea and
the Red Sea.
   Bush was expected to press the Jordanian monarch to bottle up
Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba to Iraq. It is Iraq's main outlet
now in the face of an international boycott. The U.S. Navy is
likely to set up a maritime barricade off Aqaba to block Iraqi
trade if Hussein fails to act.
   Saddam made a dramatic diplomatic gesture on Wednesday.
   He proposed peace to Iran, after their costly, extremely bitter
war from 1980-88. Saddam suggested that Iran join Iraq in
partnership against the Americans who are ``fishing in dirty
waters'' in the gulf.
   Iran sounded receptive. The two neighbors stopped fighting under
a U.N.-brokered cease-fire in 1988, but signed no peace accord.
   Saddam said in a letter to President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran
that in exchange for a peace treaty, Iraq will pull its troops out
of Iranian territories occupied in the war, starting Friday, and
free tens of thousands of Iranian POWs.
   Iraq today said it will release 1,000 Iranian prisoners a day
beginning Friday.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on
Thursday branded President Bush a liar and warned that any war with
Iraq would result in thousands of American dead.
   In what was described as an open letter to Bush, Saddam said the
U.S. president had lied about American objectives in the Persian
Gulf region.
   After Iraq overran its small neighbor Kuwait on Aug. 2, American
and other forces moved in to protect oil-rich Saudi Arabia, fearing
the kingdom might be the next target.
   Saddam repeated his assertion that Iraq would never withdraw
from Kuwait. The remarks were carried by the official Iraqi News
Agency and monitored in Nicosia.
   His statement said Iraqis were praying there would be no
military confrontation _ which would, it said, lead to ``thousands
of Americans wrapped in sad coffins.''
   In response, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said:
``We haven't really analyzed the statement in detail but it appears
to be just another example of his outlandish rhetoric and his
attempts to distort the truth. We believe that his words cannot
distract the world from the facts of Iraqi aggression.''
   The Iraqi leader accused Bush of ``mockery and disregard'' for
Arab sentiment, and said the U.S. reaction to events in the Persian
Gulf convinced him even more of the need for ``a holy war against
the invading forces.''
   Saddam called for a holy war last week against the foreign
forces in the Persian Gulf region.
   He seemed particularly incensed by Bush's assertion that he,
Saddam, had lied. On Wednesday, in a speech at the Pentagon, Bush
said Saddam deceived his Arab neighbors by invading Kuwait.
   ``You have lied, Mr. U.S. president, to your people when you
told them that you were massing troops to protect American
interests in Saudi Arabia,'' Saddam responded.
   Saddam also claimed he had never promised Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak that his forces would not move into Kuwait.
   Mubarak had tried to mediate the Iraqi oil and land claims
against Kuwait just prior to the invasion and had expressed
optimism a settlement was in the works. Then Saddam's army moved in.
   The Iraqi president repeated his claim that Kuwait is an
integral part of Iraq and always has been.
   ``We are on our soil. Kuwaitis and Iraqis are all Iraqis,
eternally,'' he said.
   Iraq annexed Kuwait six days after its Aug. 2 invasion. Iraq's
official media now refer to Kuwait as a southern Iraqi city.
   Saddam said asking Iraqi forces to pull out was like asking the
U.S. Army to withdraw from the southern United States.
   He repeated that Kuwait's ruling Al-Sabah family would never
return to power, and said they had brought shame on Arabs by
``their alliances with their likes among the Westerners and the
Americans.''
   Twelve of the Arab League's 21 members voted last week to send
Arab forces to join the Western military buildup. They also voted
to respect U.N.-ordered military and economic sanctions against
Iraq.
   Saddam heaped scorn on the Arab states that moved against him.
   ``Aren't you sad _ as you boast about democracy _ that your
allies be the retarded, thieves and liars among the Arabs, while
the believers, the warriors nd the elite be on the opposite side?''
he said.
   Egypt, Syria and Morocco have so far sent troops to join the
estimated 20,000 American soldiers already in the region. Estimates
of eventual American troop strength have ranged up to 250,000.
   The Iraqi president also said the presence of outside forces in
Saudi Arabia is a ``policy of occupation that humiliates the sacred
shrine and lands of the Arabs and Moslems.''
   Saudi Arabia contains the cities of Mecca and Medina, the two
holiest sites in the Moslem faith.
   Saddam's statement came day after he offered Iran, Iraq's foe in
the 1980-88 war, for a formal peace treaty. Beginning Friday, Iraq
will release 1,000 Iranian prisoners of war per day, Baghdad said
Thursday.
   Tens of thousands of Iranians are imprisoned in Iraq, but the
Red Cross organizing the repatriation said it can only handle 1,000
per day.
   Iraq also said it would begin on Friday a withdrawal of troops
from territory seized from Iran in the final weeks of the war. That
will give Saddam more manpower to focus on the brewing
confrontation with the multinational forces deployed in the region.
   Iraq said the withdrawal would take five days. As many as
400,000 Iraq troops of Saddam's million-man army are stationed
along the border with Iran.

   The U.S. share of world and domestic
telecommunications equipment markets is declining, the Commerce
Department said Thursday.
   It said the falling market share was the result of foreign
barriers to competition and reduced productivity and innovation by
U.S. companies aiming primarily at short-term profit.
   The department said the government and private industry need to
take strong, sustained actions to stem the negative balance of
trade in telecommunications equipment.
   In 1988, that trade balance was a negative $2.6 billion. A
decade earlier, the balance was a positive $1.1 billion.
   Based on a two-year study, the department said the United States
remains the world's leader in high-tech communications equipment
and services, such as sophisticated switching and transmission
equipment, but is no longer competitive in ``low-end'' equipment
such as residential telephones.
   The report blamed part of the deficit on barriers to foreign
markets, the availability of low-cost capital overseas and export
support given foreign companies by their governments.
   But the study also cited a ``troubling'' trend in which the
United States was lagging behind some other industrialized nations
in worker education and training. A recent survey by the National
Alliance of Business found that some U.S. companies must interview
seven or eight applicants on average to find one acceptable
employee.
   The study also said U.S. companies keep their eyes trained too
much on the bottom line instead of making long-term investments in
research and development and in improving manufacturing processes
and technologies.
   ``U.S. industry can remain the world leader by taking a
long-term view, emphasizing R&amp;D spending and improvements in
manufacturing technology, and keeping up pressure on export
markets,'' Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said in a prepared
statement. ``The U.S. government will do its part by aggressively
pursuing measures to open markets in countries that erect unfair
barriers.''
   Undersecretary Michael Farren said it was an ``absolute
necessity that long-term thinking'' ply a larger role at U.S.
corporations.
   Undersecretary Janice Obuchowski said short-term profit is the
top priority for U.S. telecommunications companies whereas, in
Japan, the primary goal is to increase world market share.
   She said that the United States still leads the world in worker
productivity, but that Japan and Britain are gaining.

   The U.S. network anchorman buildup in the Middle
East continued Thursday as both ABC's Sam Donaldson and NBC's Tom
Brokaw reported for duty in Saudi Arabia.
   Brokaw, anchorman of ``NBC Nightly News,'' and Donaldson,
co-anchor of ``PrimeTime Live,'' flew to Saudi Arabia Wednesday
night, raising to seven the number of network anchors sent to
report on the Middle East crisis.
   ``CBS Evening News'' anchor Dan Rather, who entered Iraq
Wednesday, has been reporting from the Middle East since Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait sparked the crisis. ``CBS This Morning''
co-anchor Harry Smith began doing that Monday in Cairo.
   ABC ``Nightline'' anchor Ted Koppel, who on Tuesday became the
first U.S. network correspondent allowed into Iraq, flew back to
Jordan Thursday, but ``World News Sunday'' anchor Forrest Sawyer
remained in Baghdad, ABC said.
   However, in a phone report Thursday afternoon, Sawyer said Iraqi
officials have told both ABC and CBS crews they won't be allowed to
make any more satellite TV transmissions, and had to leave the
country.
   ``We've been told that we're to be on the next plane out, and
they've already collected our passports,'' he reported.
   CBS spokeswoman Donna Dees said the network had heard nothing
similar from its contingent still in Baghdad, including
correspondent Allen Pizzey.
   ``Sunday Today'' co-anchor Garrick Utley, who flew to the Middle
East last week, was expected to arrive in Iraq Thursday night, said
Steve Friedman, executive producer of ``NBC Nightly News.''
   He said he knew of Sawyer's report, but Iraqi officials have
told Utley ``he can get in and we're assuming they're still keeping
their word.''

<HEAD>Yelstin Says He, Gorbachev Interrupting Vacation to Work on
Economy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Russian leader Boris N. Yeltsin said Thursday he
and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev are interrupting their
summer trips and returning to Moscow to salvage their emergency
plan for rescuing the Soviet economy.
   Yeltsin, president of the vast Russian republic, on Wednesday
broke off his three-week tour of the republic to join in drafting
the economic program, according to the official Tass news agency.
   Yeltsin also told Tass that Gorbachev was returning to Moscow
from the southern Crimea, where he had been expected to vacation
for a month.
   Yeltsin said Tuesday ``a conflict'' had developed within the
12-member commission that he and Gorbachev appointed earlier this
month to develop a joint blueprint for moving toward a market
economy. The Russian president did not specify what issue was in
dispute.
   After meeting with commission members Thursday, Yeltsin said the
members were having trouble getting information from the Soviet
Finance and Defense Ministries, which control vital sectors of the
economy. But he said, without elaborating, that they agreed on
measures to avoid chaos during the changeover from a command
economy to a market-oriented system that both men envision.
   Yeltsin also accused Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov of
duplicating the commission's work by developing a parallel economic
plan.
   ``It is necessary to concentrate on our program, which is
trusted by the people and is both novel and realistic,'' Tass
quoted Yeltsin as saying.
   Yeltsin said if both plans are presented to the national
parliament for approval in September, Russia will ``adopt its own
plan, and the issue will be closed.''
   Gorbachev has ordered all national government agencies to
cooperate with the high-level economy commission.
   However, Yeltsin complained that the commission has not even
obtained a breakdown of the current Soviet budget and blamed
bureaucratic obstacles on ``either a lack of desire or sabotage,''
according to the Interfax news agency of Radio Moscow.
   Members of the commission include Gorbachev's top economic
adviser, Nikolai Y. Petrakov, a strong proponent of market reforms;
Deputy Prime Minister Leonid A. Abalkin; Presidential Council
member Stanislav Shatalin; and officials of the Russian republic.
   Yeltsin said the economic package could be implemented by Oct.
1. He said its top priority would be to stabilize the economy. To
improve the circulation of money, it would strengthen the ruble by
Jan. 1.
   The economy is unable to provide enough housing, food or basic
consumer goods for the Soviet people, and economists blame part of
the problem on an excess supply of rubles and inefficient
production and distribution.
   Yeltsin said Gorbachev has been in daily telephone contact with
the commission since beginning his vacation in early August.
   ``As far as I know, (Gorbachev) decided to cut short his
vacation in order to come here and personally supervise the work,''
Yeltsin told reporters.
   It was not known when Gorbachev would return to the capital.
   Yeltsin on Aug. 6 began a tour of Russia, which encompasses
three-quarters of the Soviet land mass and half its population. He
is scheduled to go back on the road, to Novokuznetsk, on Friday.
   During his meetings in local communities, Yeltsin has suggested
Russia will borrow $7 billion to $10 billion from the West to ease
food shortages and promised that all businesses in the republic
will be free to run their own affairs beginning Jan. 1.
   He said Russia will study national construction and development
programs, including space, and stop financing those which are
unprofitable. He also pledged to contribute only $36 billion to the
national budget, compared with $112 billion in past years. He also
said he will press for a 15 percent cut in national defense
spending.
   Russia already has claimed sovereignty over its natural
resources, and last week Yeltsin declared invalid all contracts
signed by the central government to sell those resources. That
includes a $5 billion deal to sell Russia's diamonds to the De
Beers diamond syndicate.
   On Wednesday, he said Russia would set a maximum income tax of
38 percent, and that it would be lower for entrepreneurs who
stimulated the economy by creating jobs.
   Yeltsin was elected president in June, and quit the Communist
Party in July, saying he wanted to devote more time to his new
duties.

   Newcomer Garth Brooks led the finalists
for the 1990 County Music Associatian awards with five nominations
on Thursday. He says it's more than just a dream come true _ he
gets to rent a tuxedo.
   ``This is like getting five invitations to a dance and not
knowing if you'll get to dance or who with,'' Brooks said in
Springfield, Ill., where he was performing.
   Brooks, who's been recording for only a year and was boosted by
his touching song ``If Tomorrow Never Comes,'' outdid established
stars like Randy Travis, Hank Williams Jr. and the group Alabama in
nominations for country music's top awards.
   ``It's an award enough to be touring and fulfilling my dream,
but this is great,'' said the 27-year-old
singer-songwriter-guitarist. ``Plus I get to rent a tux.''
   The association announced its finalists Thursday; the winners
will be announced during a nationally televised show Oct. 8.
   Brooks was nominated for male vocalist of the year, single and
song of the year for ``If Tomorrow Never Comes,'' music video of
the year for ``The Dance'' and the Horizon Award for career
development.
   Brooks, whose songs deal with love and the value of romance and
affectionate communication, has had a quick career rise after just
three years in Nashville.
   ``If Tomorrow Never Comes,'' ``The Dance'' and ``I'm Much Too
Young (to Feel This Damn Old)'' have all been No. 1 country music
records during the past year.
   He briefly ran a boot store here before breaking into the music
business. Prior to arriving in the country music capital, Brooks
was a student at Oklahoma State University, where he was a javelin
thrower for the school track team.
   For the top CMA award, entertainer of the year, the finalists
are Clint Black, Kathy Mattea, Ricky Van Shelton, 1989 winner
George Strait and Travis.
   Travis, who has dominated country music awards for the past five
years, failed to win a nomination as top male vocalist. Those went
to Brooks, Black, Rodney Crowell, 1989 winner Shelton and Strait.
   The finalists for top female vocalist are Patty Loveless, 1989
winner Mattea, Reba McEntire, Lorrie Morgan and Tanya Tucker.
   The finalists and winners are chosen by the 6,000 singers,
musicians, songwriters and others who are CMA members.
   The other finalists for single of the year are ``Here in the
Real World'' by Alan Jackson, ``Killin' Time'' by Black, ``When I
Call Your Name'' by Vince Gill and ``Where've You Been'' by Mattea.
   The finalists for No. 1 album are ``Here in the Real World'' by
Jackson, ``I Wonder Do You Think of Me'' by the late Keith Whitley,
``Livin' It Up'' by Strait, ``Pickin' on Nashville'' by the
Kentucky HeadHunters and ``RVS III'' by Shelton.
   The song of the year finalists, besides Brooks, are ``Here in
the Real World'' by Jackson and Mark Irwin, ``Killin' Time'' by
Black and Hayden Nicholas, ``When I Call Your Name'' by Gill and
Tim DuBois and ``Where've You Been'' by Jon Vezner (Mattea's
husband) and Don Henry. This category is for songwriters.
   For vocal duo of the year, the finalists are Baillie &amp; the Boys,
the Bellamy Brothers, Foster &amp; Lloyd, five-time winners the Judds
and Sweethearts of the Rodeo.
   Country music superstars Alabama, Dolly Parton and Hank Williams
Jr. failed to receive nominations.

<HEAD>Albania Announces Will Back Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albania announced Thursday that it would
adhere to the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty, in effect
committing itself not to manufacture such arms.
   ``The Presidium of the People's Assembly ... decided by decree
the adherence of our country'' to the treaty, said a report by the
Albanian state ATA news agency, monitored in Vienna.
   Albania has no nuclear weapons, nor does it possess nuclear
reactors, which give off radioactive waste that could be used in
the manufacture of such arms.
   The declaration thus appeared to have a mostly symbolic
character, although experts at the International Atomic Energy
Agency said Albania possibly had several research reactors at
universities producing sufficient waste to produce some weapons.
   The decision, announced by Albania's state ATA news agency, was
the latest sign that the small Balkan country was determined to
move away from its isolationist reputation and be party to
international treaties and conventions. Albania would be the 141st
country to accept the non-proliferation treaty.
   Diplomatic ties with Moscow were reestablished last month after
a nearly three decade hiatus occasioned by ideological differences.
Albania also has served notice it wants to renew ties with
Washington.
   Moves to increase relations with foreign countries have been
accompanied by internal reforms that have loosened the Communist
Party's omnipresent grip. But the Communist leadership has served
notice it will not permit democracy of the kind that has
transformed the rest of East Europe.
   The government announced July 31 that it would allow the
formation of joint ventures and other forms of foreign
participation in the economy and decreed limited freedoms to stage
public demonstrations.
   Those moves appeared designed to ease economic backwardness and
provide a safety valve for a restive population dissatisfied with a
low living standard and lack of personal freedoms.
   In recent weeks, Albanian citizens demanding change forced their
way into foreign embassies in Tirana and were allowed to leave the
country.

   When Faith Farrell and her two roommates
started getting obscene phone calls, they didn't know quite what to
think.
   The calls _ filled with heavy breathing and unwholesome
suggestions _ came from different people. And the police determined
that the calls were coming from all over the place.
   The calls kept coming for three weeks, around the clock.
   ``You'd get heavy breathing on one line, then when you answered
the other line on call-waiting ... why, there was heavy breathing
on that line too,'' said Farrell, 23.
   Then one day a caller was unusually violent and angry.
   ``He wanted someone to talk dirty to him,'' Farrell said. ``He
asked what kind of an operation was this?''
   It turned out the dirty talkers simply had the wrong number.
   The man said he got the number _ the last four digits of which
spelled ``GIRL'' _ from an ad in a local weekly newspaper.
   The ad read in part: ``Share the Fantasy ... Creative, Sensuous,
Fulfilling ... Major Credit Cards,'' and offered a phone number.
   But many callers didn't see the 1-800 in small type and only
dialed the last seven digits _ Farrell's number.
   The ad was changed this week after the company and the newspaper
were told of the problem.
   And now Farrell knows an easy way to help people remember her
number.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Rebels Knock Out Power before Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCOS ALEMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador _ Guerrilla attacks have blacked out
45 percent of El Salvador on the eve of renewed peace talks between
the right-wing government and its leftist foes, utility officials
reported Thursday.
   Representatives of the government of President Alfredo Cristiani
and the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front are to meet
Friday in Costa Rica for a fourth round of talks aimed at a
possible September cease-fire.
   But officials of the state-owned Rio Lempa Executive Commission
said guerrilla attacks on 17 main electric transmission lines in
recent days have knocked out power to nearly half this small
Central American nation of 5 million people, with all 14 provinces
affected.
   A commission official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said repairs have not been carried out ``because the
terrorists have mined the vicinity of the 17 demolished towers and
workers' lives would be endangered.''
   Demolitions experts of the rebel front, known as the FMLN,
dynamited two electricity stations in the capital Wednesday night,
complicating repair tasks, commission officials said.
   Power in the capital is rationed to five hours per zone daily.
   The armed forces said rebels harassed National Guard positions
in Jucuapa, about 70 miles east of the capital, on Thursday but
reported no casualties.
   The army reported that during nine years of war it killed 20,463
guerrillas while losing 7,118 soldiers. It said 4,955 civilians
also were killed.
   Joaquin Caceres of the non-government Human Rights Commission
reported that since the war intensified following an Oct. 15, 1979,
coup, El Salvador suffered about 73,000 civilians killed and 7,500
missing.
   He said the army figures ``try to obscure the grave violations
of human rights which have occurred in these years of war,
especially with the (military) bombing of rural zones.''
   The peace talks in San Jose, Costa Rica's capital, were expected
to focus on rebel demands that the size of the armed forces,
estimated at 54,000 men, be reduced and that officers guilty of
severe human rights violations be purged.
   Schafik Handal of the rebel general command has said that the
``impunity, purification and reduction of the armed forces are
indispensable themes of discussion to advance the negotiations to
put an end to the war.''
   Oscar Santamaria, the chief government delegate, said a
cease-fire should come first.
   The two sides agreed at last month's sessions in Costa Rica to
accept U.N. supervision of human rights following any cease-fire
accord.
   They agreed in Geneva in December 1989 to hold periodic meetings
under United Nations' supervision. The first rounds were in
Venezuela and Mexico.
   Last May, both sides agreed in Caracas to sign a cease-fire
agreement by Sept. 15.

   Naval authorities Thursday blocked a
Kuwaiti freighter from unloading cotton in this northeastern port,
enforcing the U.N. embargo on Iraq and occupied Kuwait, a spokesman
said.
   The Kuwaiti-flagged Trident Arrow had picked up cotton in Buenos
Aires, Argentina, and made a port call at Leixoes, Portugal, before
arriving in Barcelona, according to the navy spokesman who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The cargo ship intended to unload 1,100
tons of cotton here.
   The ship is owned by the United Arab Shipping Co. of Kuwait,
which has offices in London. The offices could not be reached by
telephone for comment Thursday.
   In Madrid, Merchant Marine spokesman Francisco Suarez Llanos
said naval authorities in Spain have been ordered to prohibit all
trade involving ships owned by or contracted by Iraq and Kuwait.
The United Nations ordered the embargo on Aug. 6, four days after
Iraq invaded Kuwait.

<TEXT>
   The United States reiterated Thursday that it is
keeping its options open in case of a chemical attack by Iraq,
including retaliation with its own chemical weapons.
   U.S. chief delegate Stephen J. Ledogar was referring to earlier
Washington warnings when he spoke at the 40-nation Geneva
Conference on Disarmament, at which Iraq has observer status.
   ``The United States has simply said that if we are attacked with
chemical weapons, we must have a variety of response options,
including the option to respond in kind so long as we still have
some chemical weapons,'' he said.
   ``We earnestly wish that such precautions were unnecessary,'' he
added. ``But as the sad developments of the last two weeks show all
too clearly, setting a good example is not enough.''
   The United States and other powers pledged in an international
pact during the 1970s not to be the first to use chemical weapons.
The use of chemical weapons in war was banned under the Geneva
Conventions after World War I.
   Iraq acknowledged using the weapons during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq
war.
   Ledogar's address came as the summer session of the Geneva
conference was drawing to a close. Discussions focused on the
projected treaty to ban production, stockpiling and usage of
chemical weapons worldwide.
   He said arguments and procedural challenges during the session,
which ends Aug. 24, indicated that ``we have reached the inevitable
phase in our work when the tough questions are on the table.''
   Soviet chief delegate Sergey Batsanov told the conference
earlier that Moscow was concerned because of what he said was a
``lack of progress in finding answers to the key political issues''
involved. He announced support for a French proposal to convene a
ministerial meeting in January to help complete the proposed treaty.
   ``Sometimes, we resort to a kind of diplomatic minuet when
outdated positions are being reintroduced by those who in the past
convincingly criticized them,'' Batsanov said, without naming any
country.
   He said political solutions were required for a set of problems,
dealing especially with measures to prevent violations of the
treaty and moves to ensure compliance worldwide.
   Methods of verification, or ensuring compliance, have been main
hurdles in the talks which date to 1968. But progress on this and
other issues had prompted optimistic forecasts that final agreement
was within reach on what diplomats agree will be the most
complicated disarmament measure in history.

<TEXT>
   Homicides are the leading cause of fatal
on-the-job injuries among American women, according to a federal
study released Thursday.
   ``If a woman's going to die from an injury at work, she's
probably going to be murdered,'' said Catherine Bell, an
epidemiologist with the National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health, a division of the national Centers for Disease Control.
   Forty-two percent of workplace trauma deaths of women in the
United States from 1980 to 1985 were homicides, the CDC reported.
Job-related motor vehicle accidents were second, at around 39
percent.
   By comparison, homicides accounted for 12 percent of men's
occupational fatalities. For both sexes nationwide, about 13
percent of on-the-job trauma deaths during 1980-85 were homicides,
the CDC reported.
   Health institute investigators identified 950 female
occupational homicides over the six-year period. Of that number,
389 _ or 41 percent _ worked in the retail field.
   Although research is not complete, it seems that strangers in
the store _ not co-workers _ are responsible for most workplace
killings of women, Ms. Bell said.
   ``They appear to be robbery-associated crimes in the retail
trade,'' she said.
   The killings peaked from December to March. Sixty-four percent
of the killings were committed with guns; 19 percent were
stabbings. The workplace homicide rate for black women was nearly
double that for white women.
   The CDC did not release figures for causes of workplace trauma
deaths among women other than homicides and vehicular accidents.
   The report's findings suggest public health professionals need
to devise ways to reduce women's risk in the workplace, Ms. Bell
said.
   ``There are ways to prevent these homicides,'' she said.
   Safety precautions such as better lighting, safer cash-handling
and even bulletproof barricades should be considered, the federal
agency said.
   Comparable findings regarding killings of men in the workplace
are not complete, Ms. Bell said.
   But most on-the-job deaths involve male workers _ who
traditionally dominate more dangerous occupations. Most of the male
workplace deaths are accidental.

   Major industries are covering up lack of real
progress in pollution control through ``phantom reductions'' in
toxic emissions, the National Wildlife Federation said Thursday.
   The claims were rejected by ALCOA Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Paul H. O'Neill, who appeared at the conservation
organization's news conference and accused the federation of
``malicious, deliberate misrepresentation'' of the facts.
   The federation, in a 136-page report entitled ``Phantom
Reductions,'' named ALCOA as a prime example of a company using
``creative accounting'' to reduce emissions of chemicals on an
Environmental Protection Agency toxic inventory list.
   An EPA official said the agency also had cited estimating and
reporting methods as reasons for reported decreases in chemical
emissions.
   The National Wildlife Federation report analyzed the 1987 and
1988 pollution control records of 29 companies identified by the
National Wildlife Federation as major sources of toxic emissions.
The 29 accounted for nearly 23 percent of 10.4 billion pounds of
toxic emissions reported under the EPA Toxics Release Inventory for
1987.
   It said that while these companies reported a 39 percent
reduction in emissions, the real decline, when ``paper'' decreases
were discounted, was only 6.7 percent.
   Federation President Jay D. Hair said ALCOA, the nation's
largest aluminum producer, reduced its reported emissions in three
Texas and Arkansas plants by 763 million pounds by merely
reclassifying the substances being released into the environment.
   ALCOA said it discovered less aluminum oxide, a chemical then on
EPA's toxic inventory list, in its emissions. Instead, the
federation claimed, the aluminum manufacturer added more aluminum
hydroxide, which is not on the EPA list.
   Non-fibrous aluminum oxide, which accounts for 95 percent of the
aluminum industry's aluminum oxide emissions, was taken off the EPA
list in February this year. ALCOA's O'Neill, in a heated exchange
with Hair, said the federation's report was a ``scurrilous attack
on our integrity and I'm here to say we resent it.''
   Hair acknowledged that a federation press release had failed to
note that aluminum oxide was no longer on the toxic list. But he
responded: ``The fact is that people are breathing 763 million
pounds of aluminum oxide. ALCOA, clean up your damned act.''
   The National Wildlife Federation report said also that Kennecott
Utah Copper had reduced its reported toxic emissions from 158
million pounds in 1987 to only 12.5 million pounds in 1988 by
redefining itself as a mining rather than manufacturing concern.
Only the manufacturing sector is required to file toxic release
inventory reports to the EPA.
   ``At best this is disingenuous,'' Hair said.
   The federation said industries also reduced reported emissions
by reclassifying recycled wastes. It said pharmaceutical giant Eli
Lilly's plant in Clinton, Indiana, cut emissions of such toxics as
methanol and toluene from 16 million pounds in 1987 to 4.3 million
pounds in 1988 mainly by not reporting wastes transferred to
another company for recycling.
   Eli Lilly spokesman Edward West said, ``the motives of the
National Wildlife Federation are great, but their interpretation of
the data is wrong.''
   He said the Clinton plant will spend $34 million this year to
purchase and operate pollution control systems and that ``rather
than attacking companies the NWF should be encouraging recycling.''
   The federation recommended closing the off-site recycling
loophole, improving EPA monitoring of toxic emissions, adding
chemicals to the toxic list and making more industries accountable
for their chemical wastes. Currently about 320 of the 60,000
chemicals used in the United States are included in the Toxic
Releases Inventory.
   EPA spokesman Sean McElheny agreed that changes in estimating
methods and in the chemicals on the list were major factors in
reported decreases in chemical emissions.
   He said EPA is working to expand the number of chemicals on the
toxic list and make reporting mandatory for more industries.

   Security forces foiled a bank
robbery by leftist guerrillas, but 12 people were killed and four
wounded in the shootout, officials said Thursday.
   A military communique said the guerrillas tried to hold up the
bank Wednesday in El Zamorano, 20 miles east of the Honduran
capital Tegucigalpa. The communique said the robbers were heavily
armed with pistols and assault rifles. Authorities had already been
sent to the bank because of an anonymous phone tip, and the
guerrillas fought a shootout with army and police forces.
   The military statement said the dead included six guerrillas,
three policemen, a bank guard, an army major and a civilian. Police
said three guerrillas fled.
   The army blamed the Cinchonero Popular Liberation Movement,
saying the group wanted money to finance other attacks. However, no
group claimed responsibility for the attack.
   The Cinchoneros first surfaced in Honduras in 1979 as an armed
wing of the country's Communist Party. It carried out a series of
terrorist acts in the early 1980s but has been thought dormant in
recent years.

   About 1,600 ``Randonneur'' bicycles, marketed
nationwide between January 1982 and June 1984, have been
voluntarily recalled by Bianchi, USA, Inc., of San Francisco
because of potentially defective front forks, the government said
Thursday.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said there are three
known cases in which riders suffered broken bones in crashes caused
by sudden breakage of the forks at the junction of the crown and
blade.
   Bianci will provide new forks at no charge under terms of the
recall, coordinated with CPSC. Only Randonneur bicycles with the
letter ``B'' on the crown of the fork are involved, the agency said.
   Owners may call their nearest Bianchi dealer or the firm's
toll-free number, 1-800-699-6400, extension 200, to learn if their
bicycles are subject to the recall.

   U.S. and European space officials
said Thursday they were not worried about opposition to the launch
of a plutonium-powered satellite that would explore the sun's poles.
   The satellite would be carried aboard the space shuttle
Discovery, tentatively scheduled to be launched in early October.
   Anti-nuclear and peace groups fear an explosion at the launch
pad or in the air could scatter deadly radioactivity over Florida.
Protests are planned closer to the launch date.
   ``They're entitled to their viewpoint. I happen to think they're
wrong,'' said Derek Eaton, the European Space Agency's project
manager for the satellite, known as Ulysses.
   Reports predicting devastation in the event of an accident are
``scare-mongering,'' Eaton said. NASA officials have said the
chances of a disaster are extremely small.
   ``This (protest) happens in every country in the world. You just
have to live with that sort of thing,'' Eaton said at a press
briefing. ``I don't feel offended. I don't feel disgusted. I don't
feel amused. It's a point of view I don't happen to share.''
   Ulysses' scientific instruments would be powered by one
radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG, which converts heat
from decaying plutonium into electricity. The generators have been
used without mishap on 23 space missions, many of them planetary
probes, during the past few decades, said Willis Meeks, Ulysses
project manager for NASA.
   It would be the second time an RTG has flown on the shuttle.
Last October, two such generators were aboard the Galileo
spacecraft that was sent by the shuttle Atlantis on a six-year
journey to Jupiter.
   Opponents want the Ulysses mission postponed until solar panels
can be installed as a power source.
   However, such a redesign would likely kill the program, said
Edward Smith, Ulysses project scientist. The United States does not
have a big enough launch vehicle to fly a satellite with the
enormous solar panels that would be required, officials said.
   White House approval of Discovery's launch with Ulysses is
expected by mid-September. Such clearance is necessary when RTGs
are used.
   NASA wants to launch the Discovery Oct. 5. The space agency has
until Oct. 23 to get the shuttle off the ground during the correct
alignment of Earth, the sun and Jupiter, whose gravitational field
will slingshot Ulysses back to the sun.
   If Discovery fails to lift off by then, the mission must be
delayed 13 months.
   The $750 million Ulysses mission will span five years. The
spacecraft would be the first to orbit over the sun's poles,
providing important information about the interaction between the
sun and Earth.
   NASA's share of the mission is an estimated $500 million. The
European Space Agency paid for the $250 million cost of the
spacecraft.

   The gap has narrowed but Republicans still are
beating Democrats three-to-one in raising money in the 1989-90
political cycle, the Federal Election Commission said Thursday.
   During the 18 months that began Jan. 1, 1989, Republican Party
committees raised $152.8 million and spent $138 million, the
commission said. GOP committees gave $1.7 million to federal
candidates and spent another $1.12 million for the benefit of
candidates.
   The Democratic party raised and spent slightly more than $44
million, gave $1 million to candidates and spent $1.3 million on
their behalf.
   Republican committees reported $24 million cash on hand and $2.6
million in debts. Democrats had a cash balance of $6.6 million and
debts of $3.2 million.
   The commission said Republicans had a 4-1 edge in fundraising
and spending at the end of the first quarter of 1990.

<HEAD>Settlement Announced In Lawsuit Over Electromagnetic Pulse
Radiation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. has agreed to pay more than
$500,000 to a worker who claimed his leukemia was caused by
exposure to radiation during company tests, the man's lawyers said.
   Robert Strom alleged the aerospace company used him to test the
effects of electromagnetic pulse radiation, a blast of electrical
energy created during a nuclear explosion.
   Under the settlement, Boeing and a co-defendant, Lovelace
Biomedical and Environmental Research Institute, also will pay
another $200,000 to support up to 10 years' of medical examinations
for more than 700 other Boeing workers who joined in Strom's
class-action lawsuit, Strom's attorney, Michael Withey, said
Wednesday.
   Strom was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia in 1985,
and he blamed the illness on what he said was chronic exposure to
EMP from 1983 to 1985.
   In his 1988 lawsuit, Strom alleged Boeing used him as a guinea
pig to test the effects of the radiation.
   Strom, an electronics technician who worked on EMP tests at
Boeing, also alleged in his suit that Boeing didn't tell him and
other workers of potential health hazards of working with the
health hazards of working with the radiation, even though it knew
there was a potential danger. The suit later was expanded to
include other present and former Boeing workers.
   Boeing has said it tested the effects of EMP on electronics in
military aircraft and communications equipment. It has denied using
Strom or anyone else as a human research subject.
   Medical authorities disagree on whether electromagnetic
radiation can cause cancer or other health problems, and what level
of exposure might pose a risk. Electromagnetic fields are given off
by many electric devices, including power lines, transformers,
video screens and home appliances, but at far lower levels than the
pulses from nuclear explosions.
   The state Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals in 1988 denied
Strom's claim that his leukemia was caused by the testing.
   The lawsuit had been scheduled to go to trial this week, but the
settlement was tentatively approved Wednesday morning by King
County Superior Court Judge Mary Wicks Brucker, Withey said.
   Under the settlement, Boeing admitted no liability and none of
the allegations in the lawsuit.
   ``The settlement will spare the Stroms and Boeing from what
would be a great expense in both time and money,'' said Boeing
spokesman Russ Young.
   ``I'm very pleased at this incredible victory,'' said Strom, who
continues to work at Boeing but on commercial aircraft.
   He said his leukemia worsened about a year and a half ago, but
``I've outlived the prognosis of my doctors.''
   Brucker is to hear any objections to the settlement and decide
whether to give it final approval at a Sept. 21 hearing.

<TEXT>
   Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually explicit
photographs have drawn the scrutiny of the Federal Communications
Commission, which is investigating complaints against a public
television station that aired some of the pictures.
   Boston station WGBH-TV included the photos in a 10 p.m. newscast
July 31 during a segment about Mapplethorpe's work, which went on
exhibit at the Institute of Contemporary Art the next day.
   The exhibit has generated heated debate since last year, when
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., attacked it, prompting Congress to limit
federal grants to art deemed obscene.
   The director of a Cincinnati art gallery that exhibited the
photographs is being tried for pandering obscenity. A few of the
photographs depict naked children or homoerotic sex.
   At least three people have complained to the FCC since WGBH
showed some of the photographs. Among them was Donald Wildmon, head
of the American Family Association in Tupelo, Miss., who sent a
videotape of the broadcast to the FCC.
   A letter from Wildmon described the broadcast as ``nothing more
than the sensational presentation of potentially obscene material.''
   Eric Brass, attorney for WGBH, defended the station's decision.
   ``It just is not obscene,'' Brass said Thursday. ``I believe we
have the right to do what we did in the context of a serious news
program. We cannot be in the position of censoring debate about
censorship. That's what it would come down to.''
   The FCC has not decided what action, if any, should be taken,
said Roger Holberg, an FCC attorney.
   If material is judged to be obscene, it can be banned entirely
from being broadcast, Holberg said. But material deemed to be
indecent is given more leeway.
   Under its current rules, the FCC prohibits indecent material
from appearing on the airwaves prior to 8 p.m., attempting to put
it beyond the reach of unsupervised children, Holberg said.
   But last year the FCC, citing evidence that children often watch
late television, adopted a rule that would let the agency restrict
the broadcast of indecent material 24 hours a day. That rule was
challenged by broadcasters and other groups, and the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington is weighing whether it can be enforced.
   The FCC defines indecency as materials that portray sexual or
excretory activities or organs ``in terms patently offensive as
measured by contemporary community standards,'' Holberg said.
   Officials at the television station said the photographs were
included in the broadcast because they were at the center of the
news.
   ``We wanted to let the public know what the controversy was
about and let them decide for themselves,'' said station
spokeswoman Julie Eggleston.

   The sheriffs of four counties in the
eastern Kentucky hills were arrested Thursday on charges they took
money to provide protection for drug traffickers passing cocaine
through the state.
   The FBI set up the sting operation last year with two agents
acting as Chicago businessmen interested in shipping cocaine.
   At one point, cocaine packages were airdropped onto a farm owned
by one of the officers, authorities said.
   ``What this particular situation does reflect is the absolute
corrupting influence of drugs,'' said U.S. Attorney Louie
DeFalaise. ``As far as law enforcement officials ... this is the
largest case that we can recall.''
   The sheriffs and two other officers were charged in a 42-count
indictment that accused them of conspiracy, drug distribution and
protecting other drug traffickers.
   Forty FBI agents fanned out through the contiguous counties of
Breathitt, Lee, Owsley and Wolfe to make the arrests Thursday.
   Detained were Lee County Sheriff Johnny Mann, 39; Breathitt
County Sheriff Dean Spencer, 46; Wolfe County Sheriff Lester Drake,
51; and Owsley County Sheriff Billy McIntosh, 57.
   Also arrested were Beattyville Police Chief Omer Noe and Wolfe
County deputy Wilson Stone.
   At a hearing before a federal magistrate Thursday, five of the
men were released on bond. Mann was denied bond after an undercover
agent testified he had promised during the yearlong sting to kill
anyone who set him up.
   Terry O'Connor, agent in charge of the FBI in Kentucky, said
there was no entrapment in the sting operation.
   ``It was more than a tip. It was pretty sound information,''
O'Connor said. He would provide no other information.
   The sting was code-named ``Walking Short.'' A movie a few years
ago titled ``Walking Tall'' related the exploits of a rural sheriff
who did not cave in to corruption all around him.
   According to the indictment, agents first met with Mann in Lee
County, who introduced them to the other local law officers.
   From August 1989 to this month, the agents made payments to the
officers totaling more than $85,000. The money was in exchange for
protecting the agents' fake cocaine and marijuana smuggling and
distribution business from police detection and other interference,
the indictment said.
   A release said official vehicles of the county sheriffs were
used during the drug transactions. FBI agents were seen pulling a
pile of $100 bills from an Owsley County vehicle.
   DeFalaise said the cocaine, which totaled 112 kilograms or
almost 250 pounds, was never distributed for sale to the public.
   ``The narcotics never passed out of our hands, basically,''
DeFalaise said.
   The initial conspiracy and extortion counts carry a maximum
penalty of 20 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine or both. The
drug counts carry a minimum prison term of 10 years to life and a
fine of $4 million. A separate marijuana sale charge against Mann
carries a sentence of five years and a fine of $250,000.
   Mann was named in 19 counts, Drake 17, McIntosh 14, Noe 13,
Spencer 11 and Stone in nine.

   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Two passengers on an Ethiopian airliner
hijacked the craft to Aden Thursday, where they were overpowered by
security forces and arrested, the interior ministry announced.
   A statement from the ministry, read over state television, said
one of the plane's security men was injured while overcoming the
hijackers after the plane landed in the Red Sea port city.
   The Ethiopian D-6 plane was on an internal flight when it was
seized, the statement said. The plane and its 20 passengers
returned to Ethiopia after the incident, it said.
   The statement did not give the identities of the hijackers but
they were believed to be Ethiopians.
   Several military aircraft from Ethiopia have defected across the
Red Sea to Yemen. Eritrian opposition groups fighting for
independence from Addis Ababa have political offices in Yemen.

   Soviet rock star Victor Tsoi, lead singer of the
popular group Kino, was killed in a car crash while returning from
a fishing trip in Latvia, the Tass news agency reported Thursday.
   No age was given for Tsoi, who apparently fell asleep while
driving and struck a bus, according to traffic police.
   Kino, a hard-rock quartet whose name means ``cinema'' in
Russian, became popular in 1987 first as an underground group that
was not allowed to record by the authorities.
   Kino later received permission to record, and Tsoi became an
idol for many Soviet youth. He recently participated in a series of
successful concerts in Moscow and planning to release a new album
and star in a feature film, Tass said.
   In 1987, songs by Kino and three other popular Soviet groups _
Aquarium, Alisa and Strange Games _ were issued in the United
States on a double album titled ``Red Wave.''
   Kino had been scheduled to tour South Korea and Japan this
autumn, Tass said.

   The Marine Corps is building to a force of
45,000 in the Mideast in its largest deployment since the Vietnam
war, Pentagon sources said Thursday.
   The forces include ground troops and amphibious units from
around the globe, said the sources, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
   Separately, Gen. John Dailey, the assistant commandant of the
Marine Corps, said the service is sending a ``substantial armada''
of assault troops by air and sea to Saudi Arabia, though he
declined to estimate a number.
   He said the Marines would provide ``significant combat
capability'' in defense of Saudi Arabia and would be ready for a
prolonged stay.
   ``We don't just arrive,'' the four-star general said in an
interview. ``We're there to stay for a fairly lengthy period.''
   President Bush, speaking with reporters at his vacation home in
Kennebunkport, Maine, said ``some consideration'' was being given
to calling up military reserve units to back up troops being sent
to the Middle East.
   He said the reserves were ready to serve but ``no decision has
been made in that regard.''
   The Marine buildup is just one part of what has become an
enormous movement of sea, air and ground forces to the Mideast.
President Bush and the nation's military leaders have kept secret
the exact number of U.S. troops responding to the two-week old
Persian Gulf crisis, but officials have prepared contingency plans
to put 250,000 soldiers on the ground if necessary.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Thursday that Iraq has
continued to increase its armed forces in Kuwait. He said
intelligence estimates now put the number at 160,000.
   He said there has been no major change in the character of the
Iraqi forces, which the Pentagon earlier described as having a
defensive appearance.
   ``There's a continuing flow in and out'' of Kuwait, he said.
   As for the Marine buildup, Pentagon sources speaking on
condition of anonymity said units are being pulled together from
around the globe, including bases on both U.S. coasts, Hawaii and
Okinawa.
   In the main components, the sources said:
   _ Marine combat forces from bases at Camp Pendleton, El Toro and
Twentynine Palms, Calif., are being flown to Saudi Arabia.
   _ Elements of Marine units from Norfolk, Va. as well as Camp
LeJeune, Cherry Point and New River in North Carolina will become
part of a 13-ship amphibious assault task force that will be
leaving within days.
   _ A third brigade is on alert and preparing to join the other
two for a total force that is expected to number around 45,000 men
if all units are deployed.
   The third unit, also composed of amphibious forces, will remain
floating off the coastal waters of Saudi Arabia, ``ready to land
and project power anywhere on the peninsula,'' the sources said.
   The forces will be bolstered by some 100 M60-A1 heavy tanks,
more than 150 ground attack jets armed with AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9
Sidewinder missiles, and an array of troop transports, attack
helicopters and light armored vehicles armed with 25 mm canons.
   All units arrive with the fuel, ammunition and water-purifying
capabilities that will allow them to fight and sustain combat for
30 days.
   Gen. Dailey, in an interview Thursday, said the Marine Corps is
particularly suited to dealing with the Saudi crisis since its men
can move with speed to an area with a ``formidable combat
capability,'' and yet remain off shore if necessary. ``It gives us
the opportunity to do nothing ... to use non-provocative means'' if
a crisis subsides, Dailey said.
   The deployment to the Middle East _ which has put Marines on the
ground in Saudi Arabia within six days of receiving their first
alert _ shows the worth of pre-positioning equipment and supplies
at strategic points around the globe, Dailey said.
   Such supplies are stored at the U.S. base at Diego Garcia in the
Indian Ocean, on Guam, and on the East Coast of the United States.
   The Marine forces in Saudi Arabia will be under the command of
Gen. Walter Boomer, the three-star commander of the Marine
Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton.
   At Camp LeJeune, N.C., the commanding general in charge of
Marines on the East Coast said some 17,000 Marines are being moved
to the Middle East.
   ``In Vietnam we phased forces in more gradually. This is
assertive,'' said Lt. Gen. Carl Mundy, commanding general of Fleet
Marine Force Atlantic.
   ``The barn doors are open and all the Marine Corps spigots are
wide open,'' Mundy said, adding that the movement would last until
next week.
   The number of Marines being readied for deployment to the
Mideast amounts to a substantial segment of the 197,000-strong
force. Even though a Marine Amphibious Readiness Group is helping
conduct the evacuation operation off the West Coast of Africa due
to the civil war in Liberia, Dailey said the service isn't stressed
and sees no need to call up reservists.
   Marines train in a desert environment at Twentynine Palms, the
general said, but he fully expected his soldiers to find the Saudi
environment ``extremely harsh.'' It's possible there will be
casualties ``without a shot being fired,'' just because of the
searing heat of the environment, he said.
   Meanwhile, the Pentagon announced that elements of the Army's
3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment from Fort Bliss, Texas, had begun
deploying Thursday for the Middle East.
   As well, U.S. Air Force A-10 ``Thunderbolt II'' tank-killer
attack jets from Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, S.C., have left for
Saudi Arabia, the announcement said.

   The new head of the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration said Thursday that it will take at least five years
for the United States to emerge from its drug crisis.
   ``Let us remember that it took over 20 years to get ourselves
into this mess,'' Robert C. Bonner, a former federal judge, said
during his swearing-in ceremony.
   ``It is going to take at least five years, and perhaps more, of
steady effort and involvement by all segments of our society to
work our way out of it,'' Bonner told about 300 people gathered at
DEA headquarters to see him take the oath of office from Supreme
Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
   Bonner, 48, had been a U.S. District Judge in Los Angeles since
June 16, 1989. Prior to that, he was the U.S. attorney in Los
Angeles from 1984 after spending nine years in private law
practice. He was assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles from 1971
to 1975.
   President Bush nominated Bonner to succeed John C. Lawn, who
retired in March after five years at DEA's helm.
   The Senate approved the nomination by voice vote on July 27.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudden gasoline pump price jumps at the start
of the Persian Gulf crisis have prompted four senators to propose
anti-profiteering legislation.
   The legislation would make those who profiteer on commodities
such as oil and gas during times of national emergency subject to
prison terms and hefty fines.
   The original sponsors of the legislation, expected to be
introduced when Congress reconvenes next month, are senators Joseph
I. Liebermann, D-Conn.; Richard Bryan, D-Nev.; Pail Simon, D-Ill.,
and Larry Pressler, R-S.D.
   The proposed legislation, to be called the National Emergency
Anti-Profiteering Act, would:
   _Allow the president to declare a national economic emergency
when international or domestic crises threaten to seriously disrupt
the U.S. economy.
   _Prohibit excessive price increases in oil, gasoline, diesel,
aviation fuel, heating oil and propane when such a national
economic emergency involving oil products exists.
   _Give the Justice Department power to investigate allegations of
profiteering.
   _Give the federal government power to seek forfeiture of any
illegally obtained profits from the oil companies for the benefit
of consumers.
   Profiteers would be subject to up to five years in prison,
$500,000 in fines and double damages if convicted of profiteering,
according to the bill's sponsors.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said
Thursday that civilian airlines stand ready to give up commercial
flights to ferry soldiers to the Middle East but he is optimistic
that it won't be necessary.
   Skinner also said that the government's reserve of merchant
ships with civilian crews is being prepared to supply growing U.S.
military operations following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``If it means they have to cancel flights and divert aircraft,
they will do so,'' Skinner said after meeting individually with
several airline presidents Wednesday and Thursday. He had called
the carrier executives in to discuss the impact of increasing jet
fuel prices on the industry and its passengers.
   Skinner, speaking to reporters in his office, praised airlines
for supplying hired charters that have already carried some troops.
He declined to say how many airlines had been involved.
   Several airlines contacted on Wednesday said there had been no
disruption of normal flights but that the military had notified
them to be prepared to activate the Civil Reserve Air Fleet if
necessary. The fleet is made up of several passenger jets
designated for use by the military in times of crisis.
   On the fuel issue, Skinner said industry leaders told him they
anticipate a financial crunch because of rising fuel prices, and
fares will have to go up.
   He said there is no evidence of price gouging in efforts by the
airlines to increase prices, but market demand has forced many of
them to scale back initial plans for increases.
   Several airlines had announced 10 percent hikes to take effect
this week, but most have scaled back to 5.3 percent and some are
offering even lower fares than those in effect before the Gulf
crisis. Skinner said this reflects public resistance to the
increases rather than any pressure from the government to roll back
ticket prices.
   The transportation secretary said several ships were being
prepared from the seagoing Ready Reserve Fleet, which is a supply
of 96 merchant vessels mothballed by the military at several ports
for emergency use.
   The ships are surplus civilian vessels purchased by the
military. Each is supposed to be maintained so it can be ready for
use in 5-10 days.
   Skinner acknowledged some difficulty in recruiting crews for the
vessels but said this was being worked out with maritime union
officials.
   ``This is the biggest test of the Ready Reserve Fleet we have
ever had, and it seems to be working fairly well,'' Skinner said.
   Skinner said he was forming a task force of airline industry,
union and government officials to look into ways the aviation
industry can save on fuel costs.
   He said airline stockholders are likely to end up absorbing
about half of the increased cost and that some financially troubled
carriers face a serious challenge.
   ``This could take them from a modest profit year to a very
modest or loss year industry-wide,'' Skinner said.
   The secretary said he met with officials of United, Trans World,
Northwest, Pan American and Delta airlines and talked by phone with
officials of some other carriers.

   Here is the text of the news
conference Thursday with President Bush and Secretary of Stated
James A. Baker III.
   BUSH: Well, we've had some good meetings here today, two good
meetings. One with King Hussein of Jordan, the other with the
Foreign Minister, His Highness Prince Saud of Saudi Arabia. In
addition, I was on the phone earlier to President Ozal of Turkey.
He reported in on some conversations he's had and I must say was
somewhat optimistic about the effectiveness of these international
sanctions in which most countries around the world have joined. And
so it's been a very illuminating day.
   I, of course, was very pleased that King Hussein, who previously
had announced his support for sanctions, his willingness to go with
sanctions, reiterated that to me, making clear that this was a
decision that Jordan had taken some time ago. But, nevertheless, I
put this under the heading of very encouraging _ encouraging
developments and in terms of the Saudis I _ Prince Saud very kindly
thanked me for the strong support from the United States and I told
him that we were determined and wanted to do everything in our
power to enforce the United Nations resolution which calls for Iraq
to get out of Kuwait, and the _ calls for the restoration of the
rulers to Kuwait.
   So, we're in sync with the Saudis. I feel that the differences
that possibly existed with Jordan have been narrowed, and I cited
one extremely important point there, but I was pleased to see them
both here at our home.
   I'll be glad to take some questions. Yeah, Terry, and then Jeff.
   Q: Mr. President, what kind of report did King Hussein give you
on his trip to Baghdad? And did he offer any kind of hope that
Saddam Hussein would pull his troops out of Kuwait and let the Emir
return to power?
   BUSH: I got _ he didn't go into any details of his trip to
Baghdad, and I did not come away from that conversation with a
feeling of hope that Saddam Hussein would do that which he's been
called upon to do by international _ under international law.
   Q: Mr. President, what can you tell us about reports, or what do
you know about reports that foreign nationals in both Iraq and
Kuwait have been ordered segregated and been reported to report to
one place, including some 2,500 Americans? Are you concerned that
their lives may be in danger at this point?
   BUSH: I'm concerned that any coercion on foreign nationals in
some other country is a violation of international norms and I must
say that I did see a report. We've discussed it. They checked with
one of the hotels to which people were encouraged to go, and the
hotel had no knowledge of an influx of people coming there. So it's
a little vague right now, Jim. But anything that compels
individuals to do something against their will would of course
concern me. And I don't want to overstate it, because we continue
to get statements out of these various representatives of Iraq, the
ambassador to the UN for example, that these people will _ all
countries will be permitted free passage or will not be harassed.
But I saw the report and thus I must say I was concerned. Yeah,
Anne?
   Q: Following up on that. The Americans who are in Baghdad I
believe are the ones who were taken from Kuwait. And today the
American Embassy personnel were for the first time not allowed to
go in and see them and newspeople were thrown out. Isn't it getting
more dangerous for those Americans? And would there be anything _
   BUSH: It gets more dangerous, I think, if I heighten the concern
that I've already expressed. And I said that the other day and I'll
repeat it here. On the other hand, when you get reports of this
nature, of course you're concerned about them.
   Q: Mr. President, what _ may I ask your reaction to the rather
bellicose speech we heard today from Saddam Hussein in which, as
you probably know, he called you a liar and vowed to send Americans
home in body bags?
   BUSH: Well, I really haven't seen the speech. I've seen some
excerpts or the open letter I think it was. And I think it's clear
that what we need to do at this point is to enforce the
international law; the statements at the United Nations from many
countries really say it all. And so there's no point in me
responding to the letter. I didn't see any _ or nobody's at least
presented so far to me from that letter any concrete proposals to
which I feel a necessity to respond. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, what is the situation on the ground in Iraq
and Kuwait? What's going on with the sanctions? How are they
working today compared to how they were working two days ago say?
   BUSH: The sanctions against Iraq in Kuwait? I get the feeling
that the sanctions just put into effect and just being put into
effect are beginning to take hold. And I would cite a very upbeat
statement from President Ozal of Turkey in this regard. And so,
there doesn't appear to be any shipments of oil coming out of Iraq
and that is very positive because I think 90 percent of their
foreign exchange looking for help here is based on petroleum. And
so, I'd say that is a very encouraging step. And the other part of
it has to be arms being interdicted and everything all across the
board _ foodstuffs, whatever it is. They have been penalized by the
United Nations. Chapter VII is seldom used, but it has been used
now to call these people _ to bring these people to do what's
right. And I'm _ I must say I'm encouraged with this concept of the
world staying together and making these sanctions fully effective.
So _
   Q: Is there evidence that they're feeling it, though?
   BUSH: I can't cite specific evidence. There was one little
tidbit that we saw, saying that _ and again, I probably shouldn't
even go into the details of it at all _ but anyway, it was a report
that some of the bakers had been ordered to stop making
confections, confectionary goods, whatever it is _ sweets and these
things _ and concentrate on the fundamentals, the staples.
   But I think there's _ knowing that _ the economic situation in
Iraq _ I don't think one can sustain true international isolation
for long, especially when you depend on the outside world for a lot
of your _ a lot of your goods. Yes, Ann?
   Q: If you call up _ or sign the order calling up _ the reserves,
then is that something you think you may have to call upon?

<TEXT>
   BUSH: I've not signed up anything on that _ there's some
consideration. We have a ready reserve, we have a reserve that,
I've been told by a couple of proponents of the reserves, are very
eager to do their part but no decision has been made in that regard.
   Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, your feeling now of the situation _ do you
think the situation is stabilizing or do you think the United
States and Iraq are getting closer to war?
   BUSH: I don't know that I can choose between the two options,
but I do know that there is a determination on the part of so many
countries to do something about redressing the grievances that I
think it's going to work. But I can't say that it's stabilized
totally. I hope that the American presence and the presence of Arab
forces and the presence of others _ many others in Saudi Arabia,
and in that _ those areas, has lessened the risk of further
adventure on the part of Saddam Hussein.
   Yeah?
   Q: Is Saddam making the _ King Hussein of Jordan in any way a
go-between, between the United States and Iraq?
   BUSH: I didn't get the feeling. I read some reports and now I'm
wondering where they all came from, because I'd read some previous
reports indicating that a man was coming with a letter from Saddam
Hussein, some _ maybe printed it here, which I'd find hard to
believe without any evidence. And so I wondering where all this is
coming from, and I think I addressed myself to that question at the
press conference _ when was it? _ yesterday or the day before,
where I said I didn't know of that and that I _ I _ and I have felt
to myself, and whether I said it is, I think he might have
mentioned to me if there was such a letter, but back to your
question, there was no intermediary mission that I detected at all.
   I think he'd like to find some way to be helpful and he
reiterated his interest of making everything in an Arab context,
but I had an opportunity to tell him my views on the situation and
to tell him that in spite of the differences that may have appeared
to be grievous, a few _ a week or so ago, that on the part of this
President, and I think of the United States entirely, we'd like to
see better relations, and I do think that his express willingness _
again, expressed before he came here and then reiterated _ to go
forward on these international sanctions is something that will be
widely appreciated here in the United States and, indeed, around
the world.
   Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, did King Hussein give you assurances that
Jordan would not allow Iraqi goods in and out of the port of Aqaba?
   BUSH: Yes. Jim?
   Q: Mr. President, Iraq made some pretty significant peace
overtures to Iran. Were you surprised by that? What do you know by
it? How do you think it'll affect the overall equation there? Are
you concerned by it?
   BUSH: No, I'm not concerned at all by it, and I'm surprised only
in the fact that it seems to be acquiescing to all of Iran's terms,
something that Saddam Hussein has been unwilling to accept _ not
all _ totally _ all of them. But I don't know the effect of it, and
I do know that Iran has expressed their indignation about the
takeover to _ of Kuwait by Iraq. And I see nothing that has changed
that. I don't know of any statement that leads me to be concerned
that they're going to reverse their position on that point.
   Q: You're not concerned that Iran may throw in with Iraq? Or
what does it tell you about Saddam Hussein's position right now?
   BUSH: Well, I'm not concerned about the former, and I would
simply let the facts and the evolution of events answer this _ the
last part, because, you see, I don't know that there's been an
agreement on all these points. I don't think there has that I know
of. I don't think it's been fully finally agreed, has it?
   Yeah, Terry?
   Q: (In view of that ?), don't you think he's desperate, sir?
   BUSH: Well, that's what you think. I'm _ I'd rather just not
speculate on that and just keep my eye on the ball, which is to
isolate _ in conjunction with others, to isolate Iraq.
   Q: Back to King Hussein, Mr. President. You said that he agreed
to cut off shipments to Iraq through the port of Aqaba. But he told
us that he's exploring with the United Nations what the sanctions
mean. Did he tell you that everything would be cut off, including
food?
   BUSH: Let me ask Jim, because I think he _ let me ask the
Secretary, lawyer _ fine lawyer that he is in addition to being a
good Secretary of State, to answer that, because he was the one
that engaged the King in that particular discussion.
   BAKER: Yeah. I think what the King meant was that there is a
provision in the sanctions that permits food for humanitarian
purposes, or some such language. And there's really been no
definition of exactly when that triggers and what that means. And
the government of Jordan is seeking some guidance from the United
Nations on the subject.
   Q: Is that a loophole?
   BAKER: No. It's not a loophole. It's the way the sanctions were
written by the United Nations when they voted 13 to nothing to
impose them.
   BUSH: Last one.
   Q: Are you satisfied that goods will no longer go through Jordan
to Iraq? Are you _
   BUSH: I'm not satisfied to total satisfaction on any point
regarding the sanctions. I'm very encouraged that they look like
they'll be effective. We've got to guard against cheaters. You've
got to guard against people who, for economic gain, will try to
violate these sanctions, from whatever part of the world they come
from, whatever country they come from. So I can't say I am
satisfied, but what I am is encouraged that Jordan, prior to the
King's coming here, took this position, and I think that is
something that is encouraging, and I think it might send a message
to some who have been around the world who need a little leadership
in that regard.
   Thank you all very much. I know you have a deadline. It's been a
full day. Thank you.

   Dr. John Walker, a retired surgeon
and investment banker and uncle of President Bush, died Thursday of
complications from an aneurism. He was 81.
   Walker died in Southern Maine Medical Center in Biddeford,
Maine, near this coastal resort where the Walker family has
summered since the turn of the century.
   Walker was stricken and rushed to the hospital Wednesday night.
The president drove to the hospital Thursday morning, but arrived
shortly after his uncle's death.
   Walker lived in retirement on a farm on Maryland's Eastern Shore
and spent winters in Hobe Sound, Fla.
   A surgeon who was graduated from Yale and the Columbia Medical
School, he switched careers from medicine to finance after he was
stricken with polio in 1950. He became a managing partner in G.H.
Walker and Co. in New York and a limited partner of Alex Brown Inc.
   He also became president of Sloan Kettering Memorial Hospital in
New York City, according to the White House press office.
   It was on Walker's recommendation that the Bushes brought their
3-year-old daughter Robin to Sloan Kettering for treatment in 1953
after a doctor in Midland, Texas, told them she was dying of
leukemia.
   Bush, in his 1987 autobiography, ``Looking Forward,'' wrote:
   ``After we came home from the doctor's office, I called my
uncle, Dr. John Walker, in New York City. He was president of
Memorial Hospital there and a former cancer specialist. When I told
him the news about Robin, he urged us to bring her to New York,
where early research into leukemia was being conducted at Memorial
Hospital by the Sloan-Kettering Foundation. Maybe nothing could be
done, he told us, but we would never forgive ourselves if we didn't
try. Even if the odds were a hundred million to one, said John,
``You've got to give life a chance.'''
   The little girl spent the last six months of her life at the
cancer center, where Barbara Bush stayed at her bedside while
George Bush shuttled between Midland and New York City. She died in
November 1953, a few weeks short of her fourth birthday.
   Walker was an Army major in World War II, serving in the
European theater. The son of the donor of the Walker Cup, he was an
avid golfer until stricken by polio.
   He is survived by his wife, Louise Mead Walker; three sons,
Judge John M. Walker of New York City, George Mead Walker of
Severna Park, Md., Randolph Talbott Walker of Easton, Md.; and a
daughter, Elsie Walker Kilborne of Narberth, Pa. A second daughter,
Lulie Wear Walker, died in 1955 from polio.
   Also surviving are his two sisters, Dorothy Walker Bush and
Nancy Walker; two brothers, Louis and James; and six grandchildren.
   A private funeral service will be held Tuesday at St. Ann's
Episcopal Church in Kennebunkport.

   President Bush said Thursday that a
reported shortage of sweets in Iraqi shops is one sign the United
Nations sanctions against Saddam Hussein's aggressor regime are
working.
   ``I must say I am encouraged with this concept of the world
staying together and making these sanctions fully effective,'' Bush
told a news conference outside his summer home.
   Asked if he had any evidence that the Iraqis were feeling the
pinch, Bush offered ``one little tidbit.''
   ``I probably shouldn't even go into the details of it at all.
But it was a report that some of the bakers had been ordered to
stop making confections, confectionery goods, whatever it is,
sweets and these things, and concentrate on the fundamentals, the
staples,'' the president said.
   It just shows that you cannot ``sustain true international
isolation for long, especially when you depend on the outside world
for a lot of your goods,'' Bush said.

   Many parts of the nation, already sodden from earlier rains,
were hit with more downpours Thursday.
   Strong thunderstorms and showers developed along a weak cold
front over Virginia and central North Carolina.
   In North Carolina, the storms produced penny-size hail at
Moncure, and hail an inch in diameter at Snow Camp, as well as
drenching the community with 2.75 inches of rain in less than an
hour.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms also fell on Missouri and
southern Illinois.
   Isolated showers and thunderstorms dotted most of the Gulf
Coast. There were also a few isolated showers and thunderstorms in
the lower Great Lakes region, the southern High Plains and the
southern Rockies.
   Showers and thunderstorms produced heavy rain over parts of
Missouri and Kansas this morning.
   Showers and thunderstorms also produced locally heavy rains in
the parts of the West.
   In extreme southern Nevada, storms produced 1.5 to 2.5 inches of
rain in northeastern Clark County early Thursday morning. And
showers and thunderstorms over extreme southwest Utah produced 1.3
inches of rain at La Verkin in a half-hour. There were a few
showers over Washington and Oregon.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the period ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included nearly 2 inches at Columbia, Mo., and two thirds of an
inch at St. Louis, and Kansas City, Mo.
   The coldest spot in the Lower 48 states Thursday morning was
West Yellowstone, Mont., where the low dropped to 39 degrees.

   Heart disease in this country could be reduced
considerably if Americans would just get some exercise, the
national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday.
   For instance, the CDC said, more than 22,000 deaths a year in
New York state alone are attributable to a sedentary lifestyle and
coronary heart disease.
   Earlier this summer, the CDC released a 37-state survey showing
that 57 percent of those questioned didn't get as much as three
20-minute sessions of physical activity a week.
   The agency then calculated, for 11 different states, the number
of coronary heart disease deaths that could have been prevented
with exercise. The formula took into account deaths from heart
disease in 1987, the percentage of people getting little or no
exercise, and the probability that sedentary people are 1.9 times
as likely to die from coronary heart disease.
   In addition to the 22,000 in New York, the CDC projected 12,000
preventable heart disease deaths in Florida, 10,000 in Ohio and
5,000 in Missouri. Even tiny Rhode Island had more than 1,100 heart
disease deaths that could have been prevented with proper exercise,
the Atlanta-based CDC calculated.
   Not all states were included _ just those which have launched
physical fitness-heart disease programs. And such data projections
``must be interpreted with caution,'' the CDC said.
   But ``the estimated number of preventable coronary heart disease
deaths calculated from these data are substantial,'' the report
said.
   Other states included in the CDC report were Tennessee, with
about 4,600 preventable deaths; Alabama, 2,900; South Carolina,
2,700; Washington, 2,600; West Virginia, 2,100; and Maine, 1,200.
   New York's high ranking in the projections _ 40 percent of its
heart disease deaths being deemed preventable _ was a result of its
poor showing in the CDC's 37-state exercise survey.
   Seventy-four percent of the New Yorkers in that study said they
didn't get three 20-minute episodes of physical activity a week,
the worst in the nation.
   The state of Washington, on the other hand, was best in the
country; 45 percent of its people reported getting enough exercise
to avoid the ``sedentary'' classification.
   Another leading cause of coronary heart disease is excessive
serum cholesterol. Federal health officials say about 30 percent of
Americans between ages 20 and 74 have elevated serum cholesterol
levels.

   The Bush administration's call for oil
exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was condemned by
environmental groups Thursday, while oil industry officials were
hopeful the initiative would be renewed.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Minerals Management Service said this
week that when Congress gets back from its break, the Interior
Department will push for approval to open the refuge to exploration.
   ``We're in total disagreement,'' said David Cline, regional vice
president for the National Audubon Society. ``We feel it's a
quick-fix approach to our future energy needs.''
   The big oil companies have long wanted to explore for oil on the
1.5 million-acre coastal plain, but Congress decreed in 1980 that
any decision to drill requires its prior consent.
   ``Now that people are having to pay higher prices at the gas
pump, there's a heightened awareness of the issue,'' said Interior
Department spokesman Steven Goldstein.
   There are no serious fuel-supply shortages at this time, but the
Iraq-Kuwait conflict and its effect on oil supplies ``underscores
our vulnerability,'' said Paul Laird, a spokesman for BP
Exploration, a major oil producer on Alaska's North Slope.
   Industry officials said they do not know whether there is oil on
the plain, but test results are promising.
   ``This would give us access to what we consider the best onshore
prospect in the United States,'' said Dave Heatwole, public affairs
vice president for ARCO Alaska.
   Because of lease sales, geophysical work and other hurdles, oil
production would not begin until eight to 10 years after the
opening of the fields, Heatwole said.
   Allen E. Smith, Alaska regional director for the Wilderness
Society, called the push by the Bush administration
``opportunistic.'' He said the Middle East crisis should instead
give rise to conservation and development of alternative energy
resources.
   The refuge ``is an ecological treasure worth preserving the way
it is,'' Smith said.
   The Persian Gulf crisis may also increase pressure on California
officials to ease their opposition to offshore oil drilling,
environmentalists said.
   ``I'm worried. I'm very worried about this,'' said Bob Hattoy,
the Sierra Club's regional director in Los Angeles. ``... The polls
that we've seen show that people are environmentalists until it
comes to their cars.''
   In the days following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, oil
companies were the among first to call for relaxing government
restrictions on drilling.
   They have been pushing hard for the opening of the $2.5 billion
Point Arguello project, a three-platform development 10 miles off
Point Conception and about 150 miles north of Los Angeles.
   The project could tap a reserve of as much as 300 million
barrels of oil and pump it out at a rate of 100,000 barrels a day,
oil executives estimate.
   Completed in late 1987, the project has been blocked by
wrangling over how the oil will be delivered _ either by pipeline,
as Santa Barbara County insists, or by tanker, as the oil companies
want.
   Longtime drilling proponents such as U.S. Rep. William E.
Dannemeyer, R-Calif., have used the Middle East crisis to bolster
their positions.
   ``We've got men in this nation's armed forces prepared to die on
the sands of the Middle East at a time when we say we're not going
to begin producing from a field with the (reserves) of Point
Arguello,'' said Dannemeyer. ``It gets to the point that it is
absurd.''
   But most top state politicians, including both gubernatorial
candidates _ Sen. Pete Wilson, a Republican, and former San
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat _ oppose further
offshore drilling.

   Iraq on Thursday ordered the 2,500 Americans
in occupied Kuwait to assemble within two hours in a hotel in the
capital for protection against ``unspecified threats,'' the State
Department said.
   Hours after the deadline ``very few'' had complied, a senior
U.S. official told The Associated Press.
   President Bush called the order ``a little vague right now.''
   He told reporters at his vacation retreat in Maine that
``anything that compels indivduals to do something against their
will would, of course, concerns me.''
   But, the president added, ``I don't want to overstate it.''
   The senior U.S. official said in Washington that Iraqi military
authorities had ``implied'' to Ambassador Nathaniel Howell that
they ``would go out and find'' any Americans who did not comply
with the order.
   The State Department, meanwhile, instructed Joe Wilson, the
deputy U.S. ambassador in Baghdad, to protest to the Iraqi foreign
ministry, a second U.S. official said. He called the Iraqi military
commander in Kuwait merely a ``minion'' of President Saddam
Hussein's government.
   The International Hotel is opposite the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait
City, the capital of the small Persian Gulf emirate seized by Iraq
two weeks ago.
   The Iraqis also have instructed all Britons to assemble at a
hotel in a move the British Foreign Office condemned as ``grave and
sinister.''
   Asked why President Bush did not attempt to evacuate the
Americans with military transport planes, as one member of Congress
immediately suggested, the U.S. official replied that Iraq had
constructed an air defense system around the city.
   The official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, declined
to say whether the Iraqis had deployed surface-to-air missiles that
the Soviet Union had sold to Baghdad in the past.
   Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., said Bush ``ought to tell Iraq that he
is sending a military air transport to Kuwait now to pick up every
American'' and if there is any trouble ``the president of the
United States will consider it an act of war.''
   Iraq's order that the Americans move to the hotel was given to
the ambassador about 10 a.m. local time (3 a.m. EDT) and appeared
to raise the stakes in a war of nerves between Bush and Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
   Bush had responded to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait by organizing an
international embargo and pouring tens of thousands of troops into
Saudi Arabia to protect the world's richest oil fields.
   Saddam, meanwhile, closed the borders to 2 million to 3 million
foreign nationals, including the 2,500 Americans.
   Some 500 Americans have managed to get out of Kuwait, but only
three of them in the past few days. The U.S. Embassy has urged
Americans not to risk trying.
   Another 530 or so Americans are trapped in Iraq.
   They have not been mistreated in either country, the State
Department said.
   ABC News reported from Iraq that for the first day since their
incarceration, the U.S. consul was not permitted in to see the
Americans detained at the Rashid Hotel in Baghdad. Britain also was
denied access to detainees, it said.
   Howell protested the Iraqi order as unjustified and impractical.
``We believe that this action is totally uncalled for,'' Richard
Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said. ``Most Americans would
be better off in their homes.''
   He said Howell ``made clear that he could inform Americans of
the request but that he had no power to order them to move.''
   Boucher added: ``Obviously, the situation is of concern to us.''
But he again declined to describe the trapped Americans as hostages.
   Initially, Howell was told by the Iraqi military authorities
that the Americans should go to central points, such as hotels.
   ``But then it became clear they meant the Kuwaiti
International,'' Boucher said. ``We are not instructing them one
way or another.''
   The spokesman said the Americans in Kuwait were bearing up well
though in some instances were experiencing food shortages.
   ``Of course, all would be better off, all Americans, all
foreigners, if they were allowed to leave and we will continue to
work toward that goal. If Americans wish to move to a hotel that's
fine,'' Boucher said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anti-censorship group urged British movie
censors Thursday to lift their ban on ``International Guerrillas,''
a film that portrays the slaying of novelist Salman Rushdie.
   Article 19, which has steadfastly fought Moslem demands for the
suppression of Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' called the
ban ``an act of prior restraint which is an unacceptable form of
censorship.''
   The British Board of Film Classification banned the
Pakistani-made movie last month on the grounds it criminally libels
Rushdie. The board is to hear an appeal Friday against the ban.
   In a statement, Article 19 said that if the film was libelous,
it should be screened in public and then fought over in the courts.
It noted Rushdie has issued assurances that he would take no action.
   British Moslem groups have denounced the ban on the film as
hypocrisy because ``The Satanic Verses,'' which they say blasphemes
Islam, was not suppressed.
   The 3{-hour film portrays the Rushdie character as a sadistic
murderer who uses a long curved sword to slit the throats of three
Moslems. The film ends with the villain being killed by divine
lightning bolts.
   Rushdie has been in hiding since February 1989, when the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran ordered Moslems to kill him.

   Savage, hand-to-hand fighting
between rival black factions spread Thursday into Soweto, where men
with spears and axes rampaged through a train station hacking
terrified passengers to death.
   Police and the African National Congress agreed to hold a
``peace forum'' Friday to try to halt the violence between Zulus
and Xhosas that left at least 156 people dead in five days.
   Hundreds of Zulus fell upon railway passengers, witnesses said,
pulling screaming people from the platform, killing several and
wounding many.
   Later Thursday, Zulus and Xhosas at one point fought at the main
city railway station in central Johannesburg, leaving one man dead
and six people injured, police said.
   Officers said at least 14 people died Thursday in Soweto,
neighboring Dobsonville and Johannesburg, and more than 100 were
injured. At least 15 were critically hurt.
   Police said rock- and bottle-throwing and sporadic gunfire
continued until early Friday.
   After an emergency meeting in Pretoria with President F.W. de
Klerk, ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela and other ANC officials
met late into the night with Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok.
   Just before midnight, they told a joint news conference at the
main Soweto police station that a peace forum representing police
and leaders of all parties involved in the conflict would begin
meeting Friday to find the cause of the violence.
   No immediate response came from leaders of the conservative,
Zulu-based Inkatha party, whose supporters have been fighting
Xhosa-speaking ANC supporters in Soweto and other townships around
Johannesburg.
   Mandela has accused police of instigating or allowing the
fighting between black factions in order to eliminate ANC support.
Police denied it. The meeting between Mandela and Vlok was
described as ``very frank.''
   Later Thursday night, white right-wing protesters allegedly
fired tear gas into a community hall where de Klerk had been giving
a speech.
   ``Our eyes may be tearing and our noses may be running, but we
will not be intimidated,'' de Klerk told a crowd of more than 2,000
after Afrikaner Resistance Movement hecklers disrupted his speech
in the northern Natal province town of Vryheid.
   The tear-gas canister was fired into the hall after de Klerk and
most of the audience had left to get away from the chanting,
singing right-wing protesters. Police were using dogs and batons to
herd the hecklers toward the door when the canister was fired by
right-wingers, police said. No one was injured or arrested.
   The black fighting had been concentrated in the eastern province
of Natal, where more than 5,000 black have died since 1985.
   The recent spread of the conflict into Johannesburg and other
parts of Transvaal Province indicates the power struggle is heating
up as the white government moves toward sharing power with the
black majority.
   Battles broke out in townships east of Johannesburg on Sunday.
   Moira Smith, a witness, saw children fleeing from houses that
had been set ablaze Thursday.
   ``There was blood on their clothes. I will never forget the
absolutely haunting look of terror in their eyes,'' she said.
   Heavily armed police in armored vehicles and trucks roared
through parts of Soweto, randomly firing tear gas shells at blacks.
Youths who tried to block roads with burning tires and rocks were
dispersed by tear gas.
   At one point, dozens of police fired tear gas to disperse
thousands of armed Zulus and Xhosas who confronted each other,
yelling insults and taunts, witnesses said.
   ``The Zulus are attacking the people and killing everyone,''
said one man, who refused to be identified.
   Police have reported arrests, but declined to give any figures.
   More than 90 people were killed Wednesday when Zulus attacked
shantytowns in Thokoza, Katlehong and Vosloorus townships. The
bands set fire to houses and attacked fleeing residents with
spears, knives and other weapons.
   Witnesses said the Zulus searched houses, hunting out and
attacking Xhosa residents.
   Police seized hundreds of weapons Thursday as they tried to
restore calm. The battling groups oppose apartheid, South Africa's
system of racial segregation, but are divided by leadership
rivalry, tribal loyalty and differing visions of a future South
Africa.
   Nationalism is intense among the Zulus, the largest tribal group
in South Africa. Many Zulus involved in the fighting say they would
not accept Mandela and the ANC as a future government.

<HEAD>Denzel Washington Stars as `Richard III' in Central Park</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shakespeare's Richard III is such a monster that
it takes a truly dangerous actor to play him _ dangerous in the
sense of not playing it safe.
   An actor has to pull out all the stops, even go a bit overboard,
to portray the evil genius who murders and connives his way to the
throne. After all, this man has to convince a lot of people that he
should be king.
   But Denzel Washington holds back in the new production of
``Richard III,'' which Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival
has on view in Central Park through Sept. 2.
   Washington's tyrant is more mannered than monstrous. He speaks
in clipped phrases that rob the character of much of Richard's
malicious persona. The actor hesitates, something that doesn't fit
with the king's calculating histrionics. The man should mesmerize,
be larger than life. In this production, he gets lost in the crowd.
   Even Richard's physical deformities have been lessened. The
hunchback is gone and the game leg more a limp than a major
liability. Washington is an attractive, easy-going performer, which
works against him in this role.
   Still, the actor may grow in confidence as he continues to play
the part. And director Robin Phillips has surrounded Washington
with a generally fine cast and an intelligent, straightforward
production.
   Phillips presents nearly the entire play, which is one of the
longer works in the Shakespeare canon. He balances the pageantry
and the intimate scenes well. The best moments are the one-on-one
confrontations, Richard's wooing of Lady Anne, whose husband and
father-in-law he has just murdered, and his arguments with Queen
Elizabeth after he has killed her two sons.
   The other roles in the play are purely secondary but there are
impressive cameos by Mary Alice, as that one-woman chorus of doom,
Queen Margaret; Daniel Davis as Richard's willing and eventually
doomed co-conspirator, Buckingham, and Sam Tsoutsouvas, as the
dying King Edward IV.
   The setting by Elis Y. Lam is high-tech, all-purpose Middle Ages
with towering arches and a movable backdrop of iron grating that
conveniently serves as a prison when lowered into place.
   Lam's costumes are sumptuous, especially the dazzling dark blue
cape bestowed on Richard when he is finally crowned.
   Like all the history plays, ``Richard III'' is about power,
specifically the misuse of power, and how England overcame the
rulers who misused power.
   Phillips comes up with a stunning tableau at the end of the
play. The dead Richard lies downstage while the victorious Henry,
Earl of Richmond, who becomes Henry VII, is carried off in triumph
by a cheering crowd.
   It's a fitting climax to Shakespeare's history plays that begin
with ``Richard II,'' and work their way through ``Henry IV,'' parts
1 and 2, ``Henry V'' and the three parts of ``Henry VI.'' Now if
only the Richard of this production could match the monster that
Shakespeare put on stage.

   The Persian Gulf showdown between Iraq and the United States
took a more personal turn Thursday when Iraq's Saddam Hussein
called President Bush a liar and said the outbreak of holy war
could bring thousands of Americans home in coffins.
   Bush, commenting on the two-week-old gulf crisis from his
vacation home in Maine, said he saw little reason to be optimistic
about a settlement of the dispute, which stems from Iraq's invasion
of oil-wealthy Kuwait and its subsequent military buildup on the
border of Saudi Arabia.
   After a two-hour meeting at his Kennebunkport home with King
Hussein of Jordan, Bush said, ``I did not come away with any
feeling of hope'' that Iraq would withdraw its army from Kuwait.
   Bush also said Thursday that King Hussein assured him Jordan
would close the last remaining free port to most Iraqi trade as the
economic embargo on materials to Iraq continued unabated.
Foodstuffs are among the goods being blocked from entry; Iraq
imports about three-quarters of its food.
   Pentagon sources in Washington meanwhile said the Bush
administration plans to deploy 45,000 Marines to the region to back
up the thousands of Army, Navy and Air Force troops already in
place in the gulf and the Saudi desert.
   At a news conference, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Jordan ``is seeking some guidance'' about a provision in the
U.N.-backed trade embargo that allows food for humanitarian
purposes.
   Worries however grew about the safety of Americans and other
Westerners trapped in Kuwait. Iraqi military authorities ordered
all Americans and Britons in Kuwait to assemble at a hotel,
officials said.
   ``Very few'' of the 2,500 Americans in occupied Kuwait complied
with the order, a senior U.S. official told The Associated Press.
   Iraq said the roundup was to protect them from unspecified
threats; British Foreign Office minister William Waldegrave called
the order ``grave and sinister.''
   ``What we fear is that they will be interned somewhere, most
likely in Iraq,'' Waldegrave said.
   A total of about 3,000 Americans, 3,000 Britons and more than
450 Japanese are in Iraq and Kuwait. Overall, more than 2 million
foreigners are in both countries. Iraq has called them
``restrictees.''
   In addition to the estimated 45,000 Marines to ultimately be
part of Operation Desert Shield, Stealth fighter planes and the
aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy are also headed to Saudi Arabia to
protect it from Iraqi expansionism.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Iraq has
continued to increase its armed forces in Kuwait and they now
number about 160,000.
   Saddam has been under international quarantine since his Aug. 2
power-grab, or what he calls an ``eternal merger'' with Kuwait.
   In a long verbal attack read on Iraqi television Thursday,
Saddam repeatedly called Bush ``a liar'' and said a shooting war
could produce body bags courtesy of Baghdad.
   ``We continue to pray and pray hard to God so that there will be
no confrontation whereby you will receive thousands of Americans
wrapped in sad coffins after you had pushed them into a dark
tunnel,'' Saddam said.
   He called U.S. soldiers massing in Saudi Arabia the real
occupiers in the Persian Gulf.
   Replied State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher, ``We
haven't really analyzed the statement in detail but it appears to
be just another example of his outlandish rhetoric and his attempts
to distort the truth.
   ``We believe that his words cannot distract the world from the
facts of Iraqi aggression.''
   An international land, sea and air force has mobilized since
Iraq's invasion, which was sparked by disputes over oil, land and
repayment of war loans.
   In the largest U.S. military operation since Vietnam, an
estimated 20,000 American GIs have already massed to defend Saudi
Arabia.
   ``We don't just arrive,'' said four-star Gen. John Dailey,
assistant commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. ``We're there to
stay for a fairly lengthy period.''
   Egypt, Syria, Morocco and Bangladesh also committed ground
troops, to a much lesser degree.
   The U.S. Navy has 27 ships in the maritime barricade of Iraq.
They are aided by Britain, West Germany, Australia, Canada, the
Netherlands and Belgium. Bush was expected to authorize naval
commanders to use ``the minimum force necessary'' to interdict
shipments to and from Iraq, a U.S. official said. That could
include firing across the bow to halt a ship.
   In the air, U.S. Air Force fliers say they have engaged in ``a
little cat and mouse'' with Iraqi warplanes, which have retreated
when weapons radar locks onto them. ``They don't want to play with
us,'' one U.S. crew chief said.
   In Kuwait, the Iraqis have rimmed the capital city with an
air-defense system, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. He declined to say if the weapons included
missiles, but the Iraqis have them in their arsenal. The Iraqis
also possess chemical weapons.
   The combined operations are designed to isolate and strangle
Iraq until it retreats from Kuwait. The quarantine hopes to staunch
the flow of Iraqi oil, which is Iraq's economic lifeblood, and
clamp down on food and supplies going in.
   Iraq now controls 20 percent of the world's oil reserves with
its conquest of Kuwait. Only Saudi Arabia has more oil reserves.
   The economic chokehold appears to be working.
   The Lloyd's List International newspaper, which monitors
worldwide shipping, said Iraq's fleet of 80 tankers and cargo ships
has stopped regular trading.
   John Prescott, a shipping correspondent, said there was no
shipping in Kuwaiti or Iraqi ports and that activity was trailing
off in the Jordanian port of Aqaba.
   Bush's chief objective in his meeting with Hussein was to press
the king to shut down Iraq's food and oil supply route from Aqaba
on the Red Sea.
   Aqaba is Iraq's only outlet now that an international noose has
tightened. Bush has indicated the U.S. Navy will barricade the port
from Iraqi ships. The president also has offered to help offset
Jordan's costs because 40 percent of its exports go to Iraq and 90
percent of its oil comes from there.
   ``It's our only outlet to the sea and the rest of the world,''
Hussein said. He also said of trade with Iraq: ``There are no
shipments at the moment.''
   A day earlier, scores of trucks, many with Iraqi license plates,
streamed north out of Aqaba to Amman and onto the desert highway
bound for Iraq.
   The Jordanian monarch met this week with Saddam, but he told
reporters he had no message from Baghdad. ``I am not talking on
behalf of anyone in the area ... but myself,'' Hussein said.
   In the United Nations, Libya called for the replacement of U.S.
forces in the Persian Gulf with Arab League forces and U.N.
soldiers.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, in a letter to the U.N.
Secretary-General, also called for an emergency Security Council
meeting in Geneva to remove U.S. forces. There was no decision on a
meeting.
   Thirty-two of the 159 U.N. members had filed compliance reports
by Wednesday, and all were honoring the sanctions Iraq.
   Also Thursday, Saudi Arabia called for an emergency conference
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to discuss how
much oil to pump.
   The minister denied the kingdom had notified any of its
customers of any cutbacks in oil supply. Reports attributed to the
Japanese foreign ministry said Saudi Arabia told U.S., European and
Japanese oil companies of a 15-20 percent cutback in its oil supply
in September.
   Meanwhile, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency said
Thursday that Saddam was the target of an assassination attempt,
which led to ``large-scale'' arrests, including some close
associates of the Iraqi strongman.
   The agency quoted witnesses as saying tanks and armored cars are
patrolling the streets of Baghdad. There was no independent
confirmation of the report by the government-run news agency, which
did not say when the reported attempt occurred.

   President Bush said Thursday that
King Hussein assured him Jordan would close a vital port to most
Iraqi commerce. The president said he had ``no feeling of hope''
that Iraq would roll back its army, and dispatched thousands more
Marines to the Persian Gulf.
   At a news conference at his vacation home in Maine, the
president also expressed concern about reports that Americans were
being rounded up in Kuwait by the occupying Iraqi military.
   After meeting for two hours with Hussein, Bush was asked whether
the situation in the gulf region were stabilizing or drawing closer
to war. ``I don't know that I can choose between the two options,''
he replied.
   Bush also said he has not yet decided whether to sign an order
calling up reserve units.
   Later, the Pentagon announced that the president had ordered
U.S. ship commanders in the Middle East to intercept all ships
carrying goods to or from Iraq or Kuwait, and a Pentagon official
said the order also applied to Iraq-bound shipments at the
Jordanian port of Aqaba.
   The order authorized ship commanders to use the ``minimum force
necessary'' to stop any ship suspected of carrying goods to or from
Kuwait or Iraq, if the ship refused to stop or to be diverted from
its course.
   ``To the maximum extent possible we will conduct operations
without the use of force,'' the presidential order said. A Pentagon
source said earlier that those steps could include attempting to
block the ship's passage or firing a warning shot across the bow.
   The president met with the Jordanian leader _ and later with
Saudi Arabia's foreign minister _ as military forces in the Persian
Gulf continued to grow.
   Pentagon officials said in Washington the United States was
building its Marine deployment in Saudi Arabia toward a total of
45,000, along with the other military services already massing in
the area. The Pentagon also said intelligence estimates now put the
Iraqi force in Kuwait at 160,000, and a State Department official
said Iraq had established an air defense system around the occupied
Kuwait City.
   The Defense Department, meantime, estimated that the deployment
of U.S. air, ground and naval forces in defense of Saudi Arabia
will cost $1.18 billion through September.
   The announcement said the expense beyond could not be estimated
because the size and composition of the armed forces in the
operation and their level of activity, ``are still evolving.''
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait two weeks ago _ and positioning of its
troops near Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia _ touched off the
international crisis.
   Bush was asked about reports that the Iraqis had ordered
Americans in Kuwait to report to a hotel. ``Anything that compels
individuals to do something against their will of course concern
me,'' he said.
   For the second time in three days, he said that United
Nations-backed economic sanctions were beginning to take their toll
on Iraq. But when pressed for details, he mentioned only a report
that bakers in Iraq had been told to stop making confections.
   Bush said in advance of Thursday's meeting that he would press
King Hussein to deny Iraq access to the port at Aqaba, the last
remaining waterway left open for the Baghdad regime.
   He was asked whether Hussein had offered such assurances, and
replied, ``Yes.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Jordan ``is seeking
some guidance'' about a provision in the U.N.-backed trade embargo
that allows food for humanitarian purposes.
   Aqaba is Iraq's main outlet now in the face of an international
boycott. If Hussein fails to act, Bush has indicated the U.S. Navy
will set up a barricade to block Iraqi trade from Aqaba. The
president also has offered to help offset Jordan's costs of cutting
off business with Iraq.
   Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, after meeting with
Bush, said he thanked the president for protecting the kingdom.
``We still hope that conflict can be avoided but ... if and only if
Iraq withdraws from Kuwait and legalities return to Kuwait,'' he
said.
   Bush made his comments as Saddam dampened any hopes of a
diplomatic settlement. The Iraqi president issued a bellicose
statement threatening the United States and calling Bush a liar.
   The statement by a spokesman, broadcast in Baghdad and carried
live on American television, warned that thousands of Americans
would be sent home ``wrapped in sad coffins'' if a military
showdown occurs.
   Hussein said he hoped the crisis ``will begin to de-escalate.''
However, he also said, ``I am not talking on behalf of anyone in
the area ... but myself.''
   The United States is irritated at the king because of his
defense of Saddam and refusal to abide by U.N. sanctions. On the
other hand, officials say they recognize that Hussein is in a tough
spot, with a powerful and aggressive Iraq as his neighbor and a
large Palestinian population in his country sympathetic to Saddam.
   The already formidable U.S. military buildup in the gulf kept
growing.
   Pentagon sources said the Marine Corps was building up to a
force of 45,000 in the Mideast, its largest deployment since the
Vietnam War.
   The Marines will join tens of thousands of Army, Navy and Air
Force troops already on the scene.
   ``We're there to stay for a fairly lengthy period,'' Gen. John
Dailey, assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, said in an
Associated Press interview.
   Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., said Bush should send transport planes
to pick up the Americans who are being kept in Kuwait and should
tell the Iraqis that if there was any trouble ``the president of
the United States will consider it an act of war.''
   A senior U.S. official said Iraq had constructed an air defense
system around the city.
   Meanwhile, U.S. fliers' ground crews in Saudi Arabia said
American pilots have ``locked in'' their weapons radar on Iraqi
planes several times recently, causing the Iraqis to turn around
and fly away.

   Jet fighters believed to be American buzzed two
Japanese pleasure boats southwest of Tokyo, injuring a boat
captain, Japanese officials said Thursday.
   U.S. military officials contacted by The Associated Press said
only that an investigation was under way.
   However, an official with the Japanese Defense Facilities
Administration confirmed U.S. fighters were in the area when the
incidents occurred Wednesday.
   ``The U.S. military has informed us that U.S. Navy fighters were
there, but we have no further details,'' said the official on
condition of anonymity.
   Two fighters buzzed the yacht Bell on Wednesday near Utonejima,
an island 87 miles southwest of Tokyo, according to Maritime Safety
Agency spokesman Nagatoshi Naruse.
   Naruse said the jets flew close enough to create winds that
nearly capsized the Bell, which had six people on board.
   The yacht's captain, Hajime Okayama, said he was knocked off
balance and hurt his back.
   ``The planes flew at us like they were in bombing formation, and
we were their target,'' Okayama said. ``It was very frightening.''
   Okayama said both planes came within about 30 yards of the Bell,
but he was unable to see any marks that would identify their
nationality.
   Naruse said that about one hour later, two fighters flying low
over waters near Oshima Island, 62 miles southwest of Tokyo, buzzed
the yacht Slow Hand. No one was injured.
   Kyodo News Service said the Maritime Safety Agency, Japan's
coast guard, believed the fighters were using the pleasure craft as
imaginary enemy targets. Both incidents occurred near an air
corridor used for training by the U.S. military, Naruse said.
   Kyodo said the fighters were flying so low that the four people
aboard the Slow Hand feared the planes would hit the yacht's mast.
   The news service also said that officials with the Maritime
Safety Agency have received at least five other unconfirmed reports
of similar incidents in the past two months.
   The presence of the U.S. armed forces in Japan under a mutual
security pact is still a sensitive topic here, and reports of
accidents involving U.S. military personnel receive wide publicity.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, who has both
seized and lost the presidency in military coups, signed up
Thursday as a candidate for that office in a November election.
   His action conflicts with legal opinions saying he is ineligible
to run because of the 1982 coup that carried him to power.
   The retired general, a born-again Christian and law-and-order
candidate, took power after the coup ousted Gen. Romeo Lucas Garcia
on March 23, 1982.
   Rios Montt, in turn, was removed by Gen. Oscar Humberto Mejia
Victores on Aug. 8, 1983.
   Guatemala's supreme court, in a non-binding opinion sought by
Congress last year, said Rios Montt cannot be president or vice
president because of a constitutional ban on the holding of those
posts by people who assumed power in a coup.
   Last month, the Association of National Dignitaries, made up of
people who drew up the current constitution, arrived at the same
conclusion.
   In addition, street crime and other violence is on the rise in
Guatemala, and human rights workers and others are worried that
Rios Montt's eye-for-an-eye brand of justice will lead to further
abuses in a country already plagued with them.
   During his time in office, he sent more than a dozen convicted
leftists before firing squads.
   Rios Montt is running with the backing of three of Guatemala's
19 registered parties.
   Nine candidates have signed up for the presidency, including
Jorge Carpio Nicolle, a journalist defeated five years ago by
incumbent Vinicio Cerezo. Both he and Rios Montt have done well in
early polls.
   There will be a runoff on Jan. 6 if no candidate wins a majority
in the Nov. 11 election.
   If Guatemala's elections registry refuses to accept his
candidacy, Rios Montt can appeal through the court system.

   Actors' Equity reversed itself Thursday, and
said it would allow a white British actor to play a Eurasian in the
$10 million Broadway production of the hit London musical ``Miss
Saigon.''
   The vote to approve actor Jonathan Pryce came at a special
meeting of the union's 70-member council, called in response to a
petition from more than 600 Equity members outraged by last week's
decision to bar the actor. Some 54 members of the council took part
in the meeting, which lasted nearly six hours.
   ``The council determined that, indeed, Mister Pryce qualifies as
a star in accordance with the criteria established in the agreement
between Equity and the League of American Theaters and Producers,''
said Alan Eisenberg, the union's executive secretary. Star
performers from other countries usually are given automatic
approval to perform in the United States.
   ``The council stated that it had never been Equity's intention
for this issue to reflect in any way on Mister Pryce, whose
excellence and abilities the union has consistently acknowledged,''
Eisenberg said.
   The union's reversal was taken as a sign of ``encouragment,'' by
producer Cameron Mackintosh, who had scrapped the musical's
Broadway engagement after Equity's initial vote.
   ``Over the next few days I will confer with members of the
creative team and with Jonathan Pryce to determine if it will be
possible for the production to be reinstated for Broadway,''
Mackintosh said late Thursday.
   A final decision was not expected until sometime next week, said
Mackintosh spokesman Marc Thibodeau. ``Miss Saigon'' was to begin
previews here in March.
   In changing its mind, the council took into consideration
Mackintosh's willingness to respond to three issues about the show,
Eisenberg said. They were ``his written commitment to seek
qualified Asian actors as replacements or understudies on Broadway
and to originate the role in future companies,'' his assistance
``in the vocal training of those Asian actors who may be considered
for such roles,'' and Pryce's removal of prosthetics on his eyes
for makeup ``immediately upon his becoming aware that their
intended use offended members of the American-Asian community.''
   Mackintosh had said that cancellation of the $10 million
production, which had a record $25 million in advance ticket sales,
would cost him about $600,000.
   The controversy prompted debate over the issues of
non-traditional casting, the lack of job of opportunities for
ethnic minority actors and artistic freedom.
   ``The debate is no longer about the casting of `Miss Saigon' but
the art of acting itself,'' Mackintosh said last week.
   Equity had denied permission for Pryce to repeat his London
performance as a Eurasian pimp in the American production because
``the casting of a Caucasian actor made up to appear Asian is an
affront to the Asian community.''
   The controversy began after Equity's Committee on Racial
Equality received complaints about the show's casting from
playwright David Henry Hwang, who wrote the Broadway hit ``M.
Butterfly,'' and Asian actor B.D. Wong.
   The committee decided ``it should take a stand,'' said Chuck
Patterson, its chairman.
   At a news conference Thursday, Patterson said Mackintosh did not
allow Asian-American actors to try out for Pryce's role in the New
York production. A spokesman for Mackintosh said the British actor
already was the producer's first choice to play the part on
Broadway.
   Mackintosh is one of the most successful producers in London and
in New York. Among his other hits, which are still running in both
cities, are ``Cats,'' ``Les Miserables'' and ``The Phantom of the
Opera.''
   ``Miss Saigon'' is a love story about an American soldier set
during the closing days of the Vietnam War in 1975. The musical has
lavish special effects including a helicopter that lands on stage
and takes off.
   Pryce won the Olivier Award, London's equivalent of the Tony,
for his performance in ``Miss Saigon.''
   The union has veto power over foreign actors and Pryce has
appeared on Broadway twice before. He won a Tony in 1977 for his
performance in ``Comedians'' and later starred in Dario Fo's
``Accidental Death of an Anarchist'' in 1984.
   Pryce leaves the cast of the London production of ``Miss
Saigon'' at the beginning of September. His replacement will be
another white actor, Hilton McRae.

   Convicted murderer Allan Legere
was found guilty Thursday of escape, kidnapping and assault in his
flight from a hospital last year while serving a life sentence.
   Justice Paul Creaghan sentenced him to nine years, but the
42-year-old Legere will not have to serve one extra day in prison
as a result.
   The judge explained that prisoners cannot serve extra time for
sentences added to the ultimate punishment in Canada _ life in
prison.
   The nine years are to be served concurrently with Legere's life
sentence with no parole for at least 18 years for the 1986 murder
of an elderly shopkeeper near Newcastle, New Brunswick.
   Legere was acquitted of assault with a weapon.
   He broke out of a Moncton hospital where he was being treated
for an ear infection and was on the loose for seven months.
   While Legere was at large, four murders were committed in or
near Legere's home area of Chatham, New Brunwick, and police said
the escaped convict was their prime suspect.

<HEAD>Spacecraft Bounces Radar Beams Off Venus to Make Test Pictures</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Magellan bounced radar waves off Venus
on Thursday in the first test of the spacecraft's ability to yield
the best pictures ever made of the planet's cloud-covered landscape.
   ``Magellan is beaming a signal to the surface of Venus for the
first time,'' said Ed Sherry, Magellan science operations manager
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``Everything is acting just as
expected.''
   During the test, scheduled to end Friday, Magellan was
programmed to bounce radar waves off Venus as it orbited the planet
four times.
   During each orbit, the returning radar echoes were expected to
produce data that computers on Earth will process into seven to 10
postage stamp-sized pictures of Venus' landscape. Each image is
supposed to cover a 15-by-15-mile area.
   Clouds prevent optical cameras from viewing the Venusian
surface, so Magellan was designed to use radar waves to make
pictures and maps.
   Sherry said engineers won't know until sometime Friday if the
spacecraft successfully collected the radar echoes. The data won't
be processed into pictures until sometime this weekend, he added.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration doesn't plan
to release the test pictures unless they reveal some interesting
discovery. Sherry said pictures will be released next month after
Magellan formally starts making images and maps of Venus on Aug. 29.
   Magellan went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 after a
948-million-mile trip from Earth. The spacecraft was launched from
the shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989. The mission costs $744
million, including $413 million for the spacecraft.
   Sherry said the test that started at 3:31 p.m. PDT Thursday was
designed to assure that Magellan's radar can make pictures of Venus
and to adjust the radar waves so the pictures are focused.
   The test began when the spaceship automatically followed
computer commands and turned its main antenna toward Venus, the
second planet from the sun.
   Six minutes later, Magellan's radar was operating, bouncing
radar waves off the planet's surface as the spacecraft swooped
southward from Venus' north pole. As planned, the radar went off
automatically at 4:13 p.m. PDT. After turning its antenna toward
Earth, Magellan then started beaming the information back to Earth,
Sherry said.
   The radar information was being received at NASA Deep Space
Network stations at Goldstone, Calif., and in Australia and Spain,
he said.
   The first batch of information was being sent from Goldstone to
Jet Propulsion Laboratory both by phone lines and, in more complete
form, by truck.
   The truck driver ``will be greeted with a case of beer,'' Sherry
said.

   A co-defendant of Manuel Noriega was
sentenced Thursday to 10 years in prison, and was described as the
United States' ``big gun'' in the racketeering case against the
deposed Panamanian leader.
   Enrique A. ``Kiki'' Pretelt acknowledged conspiring with Noriega
to take bribes from Tampa-based drug smugglers to help ferry
Colombian marijuana safely through Panama and disguise the profits.
   U.S. District Judge William Castagna set a special status on
Pretelt's term that could help the 47-year-old Panamanian jeweler
win an early parole. The judge told him to return after he
testifies in Noriega's drug-racketeering case in a separate
indictment in Miami.
   Pretelt's attorney, George Tragos said it would probably be at
least three years until Pretelt is considered for parole.
   Tragos had asked for the special parole status. The government
agreed, citing mitigating circumstances that included Pretelt's
clean record, his cooperation as a witness against Noriega and his
voluntary surrender.
   ``He's going to be fairly devastating to the Noriega defense,''
Tragos said. ``He's probably the best witness the government has.''
   A federal prosecutor from Miami told Castagna that Pretelt was
expected to be a substantial witness at Noriega's trial next year.
   Noriega, in prison near Miami, is accused in a February 1988
indictment of taking $4.6 million in bribes from Colombia's
Medellin drug cartel to turn Panama into a waystation for
U.S.-bound drugs.
   Tragos said that Pretelt was a legitimate, well-respected
businessman who, with the exception of this case, was ``clean as a
whistle.''
   The attorney said Pretelt got a good sentencing deal because
prosecutors in Noriega's drug racketeering case in Miami wanted his
cooperation.
   Federal authorities in south Florida approved the plea presented
to Castagna in June, making it easier for them to question Pretelt
about his dealings with the ex-Panamanian leader.
   During the 50-minute hearing, Pretelt acknowledged his
wrongdoing and apologized as 12 family members stood near him in
front of the courtroom.
   ``I know I did wrong. I'm sorry for what I did and am doing
everything to make it right,'' Pretelt told Castagna.
   Some family members spoke up, asking the judge for leniency and
telling him Pretelt had never before been in trouble with the law.
   Pretelt promised to cooperate fully, and agreed to forfeit
$108,000, the amount he got for his part in the transactions,
Tragos said.
   Tragos said his client, once a close associate of Noriega's,
broke with the dictator in 1985 because of illegal activities.
   Pretelt pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money in one
drug deal and to aiding a second marijuana smuggling attempt by
making the connections to relabel a shipment from Colombia as being
of Panamanian origin.
   As part of his plea agreement, he acknowledged working with
now-convicted Tampa drug smugglers in a partnership called
Servicios Turisticos, Spanish for Tourists Services, set up to
launder drug proceeds.
   ``A fourth silent partner in their business was General Manuel
Noriega,'' according to the 10-page plea agreement.
   The document said Noriega and the other partners each received a
commission every time Steven Michael Kalish deposited drug proceeds
in Panamanian bank accounts.
   Kalish has pleaded guilty to other drug charges and has been
cooperating with the government.
   The Miami trial of Noriega has been delayed until at least
January.
   Castagna said he was satisfied that Pretelt would not repeat his
mistake. He sentenced him to serve his time at a federal prison
southwest of Miami.

<TEXT>
   Two promoter-rappers have blended rap music with
good-natured ethnic humor to come up with ``As Kosher As They Wanna
Be,'' a tongue-in-cheek parody of the bawdy rap group 2 Live Crew.
   The duo, called 2 Live Jews, is made up of Easy Irving, known in
real life as Joe Stone, and MC Moisha, played by comedian Eric
Lambert.
   Both Stone and Lambert are Jewish, which gave them the latitude
to make fun with such hit songs as ``Oy, it's so humid,'' a takeoff
on Crew's raunchy hit ``Me So Horny.''
   Stone and Lambert's record is produced by Hot Productions, a
production company in South Miami owned by Stone's father, Henry.
   ``We thought it could be a good piece of material,'' Henry Stone
said Thursday. ``We need a little humor in this world.''
   The Miami group 2 Live Crew drew attention when a federal judge
in Fort Lauderdale ruled that ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' was
obscene. In June, Broward County Sheriff Nick Navarro arrested
members of the group after a performance in Hollywood of their
raunchier songs. The band members face an October court date on
obscenity charges.
   The parody group has even made a video and has offered it to
MTV, the elder Stone said.
   The songs, with names like ``J.A.P. Rap'' and ``Jokin' Jews,''
have the potential to offend, but Henry Stone said the feedback has
been positive so far.
   ``We've heard very little negative,'' said the elder Stone. He
dismissed the fears of the Anti-Defamation League's Arthur
Teitelbaum, who said he hadn't heard the album but opposes all
stereotyping.
   The song's authors said 2 Live Crew heard the record and thought
it was funny.
   The black-and-white video features the two as 80-year-old
performers kibitzing in rhyme.
   ``We wanted to create an aura of the early days when video was
cheap film and there were little hairs on the screen,'' Joe Stone
said in an earlier interview.

   India's foreign minister left for Iraq on
Thursday night, saying he would appeal to President Saddam Hussein
to avoid war and allow l85,000 Indian citizens to leave Iraq and
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
   External Affairs Minister Inder K. Gujral said before departing
on commercial flights via London and Amman, Jordan, that he hopes
to contribute to preventing a flareup of hostilities in the Persian
Gulf crisis that threatens economic and financial calamity for
India, the world's second most populous country.
   But he emphasized he is neither a mediator nor a messenger and
suggested the crisis is not yet ripe for mediation. ``I don't think
that bridge is ready to cross ... the concerned parties must make
up their minds if they want to defuse or not.''
   ``To tell Saddam Hussein to let my people come out, that is my
primary concern, and also to try to see if better sense can prevail
on all sides to see that the situation does not go to the
flarepoint,'' Gujral told reporters.
   He met Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Moscow
Tuesday, then flew here for talks with Secretary of State James A.
Baker on Wednesday and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft on
Thursday.
   Gujral said he will approach the Iraqis ``primarily concerned
about India's interests,'' starting with the welfare of 10,000
citizens in Iraq and 175,000 in Kuwait.
   Because of geography and economic links with the Gulf, ``if, God
forbid, something unfortunately goes wrong, it affects us in every
possible way,'' he said.
   India imports about half of its petroleum. Half of the imported
petroleum comes from Kuwait and Iraq, Gujral said.
   Half of Indian oil purchases from the Soviet Union also flow to
India via swap from Iraq, he said, and Indians working in the area
provide a substantial portion of India's foreign exchange. Also
various Indian projects in Iraq and Kuwait are under agreements for
partial payment in oil, he added.
   Thus, the Indian public and government are extremely worried,
Gujral said.

   Eleven people were robbed and beaten Thursday in
a rampage near Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, and
seven people were arrested, a police spokeswoman said.
   The violence occurred between 1 a.m. and 5:30 a.m., and ended
with the arrest of six of the suspects, said police Officer Kim
Royster.
   ``The suspects would attack from behind with bottles and bricks
and rob them of their property,'' Royster said.
   Police learned of the attacks when one of the victims hailed a
passing patrol car and pointed out his assailants in the park, she
said.
   The suspects, ranging in age from 15 to 24, were charged with
second-degree robbery, second-degree assault and criminal
possession of a weapon, Royster said.
   Three of the 11 victims were treated at hospitals and released,
she said.
   Police don't know if the robbers knew each other before the
attacks began or what prompted the attacks.

   A man shot and wounded his wife and barricaded
himself in his home with his 3-year-old son Thursday, then
surrendered to police after a brief volley of gunfire, a police
official said.
   Mack Mulkey, 32, held his son in the three-story apartment
building for four hours, said police commander James Fruin.
   Fruin said Mulkey, also known as John Polache, shot his
common-law wife during a domestic dispute.
   Holly Potter, 29, was taken to Illinois Masonic Hospital with a
wound to her left arm and was in good condition, Fruin said. Their
son, Dillon Mulkey, was unharmed.
   The situation began about 4:45 a.m., police said. Mulkey fired
several shots at police surrounding the apartment building before
he surrendered about 9 a.m. No one was hit by the gunfire.
   Mulkey faces two charges of aggravated battery, Fruin said.

   A man charged with raping a woman with a
multiple personality disorder pleaded innocent Thursday after the
victim alternated between three identities during courtroom
questioning.
   The case raises new questions about sexual consent and mental
illness. The victim says two of her personalities were raped, but
defendant Mark A. Peterson contends one of the woman's
personalities consented.
   During questioning, the 26-year-old Oshkosh woman closed her
eyes gently and paused as she moved between her personalities _
herself and characters called Franny and Jennifer _ at the request
of District Attorney Joseph Paulus.
   ``Can I have Jennifer, the one who likes to have fun,'' Paulus
asked.
   ``Of course,'' the woman replied, smiling momentarily before
closing her eyes. A few seconds later she opened her eyes and
blurted, ``Hi, Mr. Paulus'' in a slightly higher voice.
   Winnebago County Circuit Judge Robert Hawley required the woman
to take an oath each time she changed personalities, and the
lawyers formally introduced themselves to the different
personalities, assuming such knowledge did not transfer between
personalities.
   During her hour-long testimony, the woman described how she
believed Peterson raped her in his car after she told him she
suffered from a mental illness.
   The woman said she had been raped June 11 while she was
Jennifer, a fun-loving, promiscuous 20-year-old woman who liked to
dance to rock music.
   After the couple had sex, ``He said, `Can I have Franny back.' I
said, `OK,''' the woman told the court.
   Peterson, 29, of Oshkosh sat quietly and showed no emotion as
the woman testified. He later appeared briefly before the judge and
pleaded innocent to a charge of second-degree sexual assault.
   The charge carries a maximum of 10 years in prison on
conviction. Hawley agreed there was probable cause to bind Peterson
over for trial, but did not immediately set a trial date. Peterson
is free on a signature bond.
   Legal experts agree the case is problematic on several fronts.
   ``If (the woman) is not palpably mentally ill, then the
prosecution has problems,'' said Leonard Kaplan, a University of
Wisconsin Law School professor observing the case in Oshkosh, a
city of 50,000 in east-central Wisconsin. ``If she is mentally ill,
she can't consent.''
   The victim has as many as 21 different personalities, a mental
illness that typically develops after a traumatic childhood
experience, psychologists said.
   She told police two of her personalities _ Jennifer and Emily, a
vulnerable 6-year-old girl _ were assaulted by Peterson in June.
   The defense counters the woman consented and Peterson had no
idea the woman was mentally ill.
   Paulus said he will be forced to introduce several of the
victim's personalities to a jury through her testimony during the
trial, expected in October.
   ``I wouldn't say I'm looking forward to it. ... It is unusual,''
Paulus said. ``You are talking about a subject matter that is
somewhat foreign to everybody.''
   Defense lawyer Edward Salzsieder has asked that the charge be
dismissed.
   ``There is a question of when does anybody know a person is
mentally ill,'' he said.
   According to court records, the woman met Peterson June 9 at a
park when the victim was portraying a personality she called Franny.
   Two days later, Peterson went to the woman's home and invited
her out for coffee. At the restaurant, the woman reportedly
introduced some of her personalities to Peterson, including
Jennifer, the records said.
   After the pair left the restaurant, Jennifer agreed to have
sexual intercourse at the man's suggestion in a car, Peterson told
police.
   The criminal complaint alleged Peterson noted that during sex,
the woman's 6-year-old personality, Emily, appeared before the
woman eventually became Franny again.
   Neighbors have told police they warned Peterson that the woman
had a mental disorder.
   Paulus said he must prove three things _ that the victim had a
mental illness, that she was incapable of appraising her own
conduct and that Peterson knew about the illness.
   ``They all present roadblocks,'' he said, adding that he has
become well enough acquainted with the victim that he can summon
her various personalities at will.
   ``It could turn out to be the battle of the experts and
persuading a jury which expert is right,'' Kaplan said.
   Multiple-personality disorder is usually caused by early
childhood trauma _ especially sexual abuse _ and affects one person
in 10,000, said Dr. Nancy Perry, a Milwaukee clinical psychologist.
   The patient separates one part of his or herself from another to
avoid facing the trauma, Perry said.

   The pilot of a hot-air balloon involved
in an accident that killed 13 people was arrested Thursday as he
tried to leave the country.
   The pilot, Michael Sanby, has not been charged in the accident
last year near Alice Springs, in central Australia. But Alice
Springs Coroner Denis Barrett heard a recommendation earlier this
week that Sanby face 13 counts of manslaughter.
   Northern Territory police had issued a provisional warrant for
his arrest.
   Police said Sanby was arrested Thursday as he attempted to board
a Qantas flight from Perth to Singapore.
   Frank Gaffy, a lawyer assisting the coroner in his
investigation, said there is evidence Sanby deliberately collided
with another balloon in the accident on Aug. 13, 1989.
   The Coroner's Court has heard how the basket of Sanby's balloon
hit and tore open the envelope of a lower balloon carrying 13
people. Gaffy has said the pilot's intention was to touch the
envelope of the crashed ballon to give passengers a thrill.
   Barrett is expected to make recommendations Monday on any
charges related to the accident.

   Libya on Thursday called for replacing the
U.S. military in the Persian Gulf with Arab League and U.N. forces.
   In Lima, Peru, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said the use of military power to enforce U.N. sanctions against
Iraq without approval from the U.N. Security Council would violate
the U.N.'s charter.
   American officials have said the U.S.-led multinational force
blocking ships with Iraqi cargo is acting in line with the U.N.
sanctions.
   Responding to another development in the regional crisis, the
five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council met privately
to discuss Iraq's order that Americans and Britons in Kuwait
assemble in hotels.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, in a letter to the U.N.
Secretary-General, called for an emergency Security Council meeting
in Geneva to remove U.S. forces. There was no decision on a
meeting, but consultations were under way.
   Gadhafi said U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia should be replaced by
Arab League forces and U.S. naval personnel in the Persian Gulf
should be replaced by U.N. forces.
   In his comments during a press conference at Peru's Foreign
Ministry, Perez de Cuellar said that Article 41 of the U.N. charter
states that any blockade has to have U.N. Security Council approval.
   ``As long as that is not the case,'' he said, ``any
intervention, whatever the country, would not be in accordance with
the letter or spirit of the United Nations Charter.''
   The five permanent Security Council members _ the United States,
Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union _ were meeting to
discuss the Iraqi order that Americans and Britons in Iraq gather
at hotels because of unspecified threats. In Washington, the U.S.
State Department said it was protesting the order.
   Diplomats said Security Council members were also expected to
discuss the situation of those already detained, the revival of the
Security Council's Military Staff Committee and a possible U.N.
military role and compliance with U.N. economic sanctions against
Iraq.
   The Soviet Union has been pressing for a broader U.N. role in
controlling regional conflicts and has said it would only
participate in a military operation in the gulf under the U.N. flag.
   A special committee of the Security Council is studying an
interim report from Perez de Cuellar about compliance with the U.N.
economic embargo against Iraq. Though the embargo is intended to be
binding, U.N. members voted no specific measures to enforce it.
   The committee is to meet Friday. Canadian diplomats said they
intended to raise the issue of violations of the embargo and how
the committee would monitor compliance beyond official government
statements.
   If the committee decides the boycott is not being honored, the
Security Council can declare a military blockade and appeal to
member states to enforce it.
   Thirty-two of the 159 U.N. members had filed compliance reports
by Wednesday, and all were honoring the sanctions. A full U.N.
report is due by the end of the month.
   Bulgaria was the only reporting nation to emphasize the
hardships imposed by the compliance and it reserved the right to
appeal to the council for relief. It said, however, that it was
fully implementing the embargo.
   Under the U.N. Charter, nations that suffer because of their
compliance with U.N. enforcement actions may appeal to the council
for relief, usually in the form of an exemption.
   The nations that filed reports Wednesday were: Argentina,
Australia, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Cyprus,
Czechoslovakia, Finland, France, East Germany, West Germany,
Hungary, Italy, Ivory Coast, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Panama, South Korea, Romania, Singapore, Solomon
Islands, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States,
Uruguay.

   America's streets and campuses, which rang
with protest in the era of Vietnam, are quiet as the Bush
administration challenges Iraq's Saddam Hussein in the Persian
Gulf. They may or may not stay that way.
   From Washington to San Francisco, protest demonstrations have
been few and poorly attended since the United States sent troops to
Saudi Arabia in response to Saddam's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Summer school is winding up at the nation's colleges and
universities, and most students are away, but even for summer the
response has been notably calm.
   One reason is that Americans view Saddam as a villain, whereas
many thought the United States overreached in its bombing of North
Vietnam, according to experts who have observed anti-war movements
both from within and from without.

   The women among the 50,000 American soldiers in Saudi Arabia are
likely to be a disturbing if not threatening presence in a culture
where women cannot drive, vote, sit in a theater with a man or even
show their face and hair.
   The Saudi kingdom has the most conservative and rigid Islamic
way of life of all the Arab countries. Most Westerners there are
employees of Western companies who are kept isolated from the rest
of the country.
   U.S. women soldiers said Wednesday that Saudi men react with
dismay and occasional hostility when they see them doing such
non-combat jobs as repairing airplanes and driving trucks or, in at
least one case, giving orders to men.
   ``I don't think they disagree with what we're doing,'' said a
Victoria, Va., sergeant, whose name was withheld in keeping with
the media ground rules. ``I think they're more like shocked:
`There's an American woman. She's doing what men are doing.' ''

   El Salvador's military high command has
conspired to silence witnesses and destroy evidence surrounding the
murders of six Jesuit priests in 1989, charges the chairman of a
House task force.
   ``I believe that the High Command's goal from the beginning has
been to control the investigation and to limit the number and rank
of the officers who will be held responsible for the crimes,'' Rep.
Joe Moakley, D-Mass., said in a statement Wednesday.
   Moakley's statement followed a trip to El Salvador last week by
the staff the task force, appointed earlier this year by House
Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., to look into the murders of the
priests, their housekeeper and her daughter Nov. 16 at a university
in San Salvador.
   Little progress has been made since April, when the task force
found that the investigation had come to a virtual standstill. Nine
military men, including a colonel, were charged in connection with
the killings, but none has come to trial.

   Cholesterol-conscious people have long been
saying, ``Hold the butter.'' Now a study suggests they should
spread the margarine sparingly too.
   The study found that hardened vegetable fat, a primary
ingredient of margarine and shortening, raises cholesterol in the
blood. It might even be worse than saturated fat, the
long-recognized demon in the war on unhealthy eating.
   Experts cautioned that margarine is still a healthier choice
than butter. However, the new research contradicts the widely held
belief that the vegetable fats that margarine contains are harmless
to the heart.
   The study raises questions about trans fatty acids, which make
margarine and shortening hard so they can be used for baking,
frying and spreading. About a quarter of the fat in a typical stick
of margarine is trans fatty acids.
   The study was conducted in the Netherlands by Drs. Ronald P.
Mensink and Martijn B. Katan of the Agricultural University in
Wageningen. It was published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.

   No longer hatchet-wielding
prohibitionists, the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union
nevertheless is still battling the bottle.
   But instead of busting up saloons, the 500 delegates at the
group's 116th annual convention have set their sights on the
classroom, hoping to steer youngsters away from booze as well as
drugs and alcohol.
   ``We believe in teaching children not to start drinking. Then
someday we'll be able to sit back and watch legalized
prohibition,'' said its president, Rachel Kelly of Portland, Me.
The four-day convention opened Wednesday.
   The union, which claims to be the world's oldest and largest
Christian women's group with 150,000 members in the United States
and 350,000 abroad, also campaigns against abortion and pornography
and establishes missionaries.

<HEAD>East German Diplomats Will Have to Look for New Jobs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The joint work in Albania and Iraq of
the two German foreign services, unthinkable a year ago, probably
will not happen again. After unification, the East German Foreign
Ministry will disappear.
   In Baghdad, the East German ministry opened some of the
apartments in its compound to about 40 West German workers who fled
the Iraqi interior after the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2,
officials of the West German Foreign Ministry reported.
   They are staying, free of charge, in rooms vacated when East
Germany began reducing its diplomatic ranks abroad.
   When thousands of Albanians sought refuge at the West German
Embassy in Tirana in July as a means of escaping their communist
homeland, East Germans helped their Western colleagues with
translations and transit paperwork.
   The East German Embassy also sent supplies to help the West
Germans cope with the crush.
   ``There's a great willingness on the personal level to cooperate
in a pragmatic way,'' a West German Foreign Ministry spokesman
said, on condition of anonymity.
   ``But on the formal embassy work side, there's little one can do
at the moment, because as long as you've got separate East German
citizenship, as long as you've got different rules in the field of
trade and economics, each one has to do his own thing.''
   As unification nears, thousands of East German diplomats expect
to lose their jobs. The West Germans don't want them because of
their old ties to the Communist Party or even to the secret police,
called the Stasi.
   ``In the East German foreign service, most or nearly all members
. . . have at least been (Communist Party) members and a lot of
them have had close contacts with the Stasi, and that makes it very
difficult for us to imagine having them in our service,'' said a
Foreign Ministry source.
   East Germany was Moscow's front line against the West for years
and still belongs to the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Its secret service was one of the most active in the Soviet
bloc, and there is great concern that using East Berlin's foreign
service officers in a united German diplomatic corps would be too
risky, even with the Cold War ended.
   Sources in Bonn say a few East German diplomats may be kept if
they are cleared and have special qualifications.
   ``We must face the facts,'' Foreign Minister Markus Meckel of
East Germany said this month, and acknowledged that most of his
diplomats would lose their jobs.
   The East German Foreign Ministry has announced plans to cut its
roster to about 500 people by year's end. There were 2,800
employees in March, 1,800 of them overseas.
   Eighteen East German embassies and consulates are to close by
the end of September, said Hans-Martin Meckel, ministry personnel
chief and the foreign minister's brother.
   He said West German occupational experts were studying
retraining plans and one option was teaching dismissed government
employees to sell insurance in a united, capitalist Germany.
   ``We can't simply add these ministries to ours'' with all their
staff, said a West German government source. ``These people will
have to find new jobs.''
   ``There will be a lot of new job opportunities, not only in the
private sector, but particularly in the new government
structures,'' he said.
   Skilled bureaucrats will be needed in the five state governments
East Germans will create in October elections to mirror the West
German federal system, the source added.
   Officials of the West German Foreign Ministry have begun an
inventory of East German diplomatic properties around the world to
determine what should be kept and which facilities can be sold.
   East German missions, particularly in Third World or East
European countries, may be bigger or better situated than those of
West Germany, they say.
   ``Where they have a building big enough for what we need, there
is no ideological reason why we shouldn't take it,'' said the West
German ministry source. ``We will not say, `Because communists have
been in this building, we won't touch it'.''
   Although experienced East German diplomats may be out of work,
West Germany is looking for new ones.
   It announced plans to advertise for applicants in East German
newspapers with the motto: ``The foreign service is open to all
Germans.''

   This vast nation of steppes, rich in
animal species, is beginning to count its living wealth in order to
improve conservation.
   Mongolia'a many rare animals include the snow leopard, Gobi
Desert bears and wild Bactrian camels. It has equally rare species
prized by hunters, like the argali sheep and ibex.
   Officials have set limits for years on the number of each
species that can be killed, but seldom knew how many it had to
start with.
   In the case of the beautiful, predatory snow leopard, the result
has been controversy over whether it faces extinction or is
becoming n bags.''
   ``I used to think that you were much more far-sighted than you
actually displayed,'' the Iraqi president said in a statement read
by an announcer on Iraqi television that was billed as an open
letter to Bush.
   The spoken translation was provided by Cable News Network, but _
since the speech was aimed at Bush _ it also carried subtitles
provided by Iraqi TV.
   In his most personal statement to date on the crisis that began
with his Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the Iraqi president accused
Bush of trying to humiliate Arabs by the use of U.S. military force.
   ``You're going to be defeated,'' he said.
   Saddam's statement came as Jordan's King Hussein was flying to
Maine from Washington to meet with Bush. The Jordanian monarch was
reportedly bearing a message from Saddam.
   A day earlier, in a speech at the Pentagon, Bush said Saddam had
lied to his Arab neighbors about his intentions in Kuwait, and said
such dishonesty made him a threat to strategic Saudi Arabia.
   ``It is Saddam who invaded an Arab state. It is Saddam who now
threatens the Arab nation,'' Bush said then. ``We, by contrast, now
seek to assist our Arab friends in their hour of need.''
   Iraq has insisted it has no intention of attacking Saudi Arabia,
where about 20,000 U.S. troops already have been dispatched to
counter any further Iraqi seizure of the huge oil reserves in the
Persian Gulf. Other nations with troops in Saudi Arabia include
Egypt, Syria, Morocco and Bangladesh.
   In the statement, Saddam referred to Iraq as ``this great Arab
nation chosen by God to be the nation of prophets.''
   Without directly mentioning his own occupation of Kuwait, Saddam
said the foreign forces in Saudi Arabia were the true occupiers.
   Saddam's overthrow of Kuwait has been widely condemned by the
international community, which has imposed choking economic
sanctions against him.
   In the statement, Saddam repeated a threat to act to defend
Islamic holy sites in Saudi Arabia _ an indirect threat against the
multinational forces in the desert kingdom.
   Saddam's statement also followed a report earlier today by the
Egypt's Middle East News Agency, saying the Iraqi president had
been the target of an assassination attempt.
   The report quoted travelers from Iraq as saying the alleged
assassination bid had prompted large-scale arrests and a military
clampdown in the Iraqi capital. The report could not be
independently confirmed.

<HEAD>East Europeans Find Desire to Travel Isn't Enough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgi Panchev and thousands of other
Bulgarians have spent hours this summer outside the Greek
Consulate, waiting in vain for travel visas.
   Tens of thousands of East Europeans have discovered their new
freedom to travel may not mean other people want them to visit.
   ``If they'd just put up a sign saying, `We don't take any more
Bulgarians,' then I wouldn't stand here and wait,'' Panchev, 42,
said as a brusque guard turned a couple away from the consulate
door.
   ``A person loses all his hope waiting here,'' Todor Dishkov
said. ``We are waiting like beggars for something to happen.''
   An informal survey of conditions imposed by Western countries,
which used to complain about communist restrictions on foreign
travel, suggests Britain, Greece and the United States lead the
list of difficult destinations.
   Britain, for example, requires exhaustive proof of financial
resources and possession of a return ticket.
   Travel restrictions vary widely.
   Hungarians and Czechoslovaks need no visas for most of Western
Europe, but Bulgarians, Romanians and Poles face waits of weeks or
months for approval. Western governments increasingly fear the
poorer East Europeans simply won't return home.
   Romanians typically have waited 40 to 60 days for the 30,000
visas the Italian Consulate in Bucharest issued in the last seven
months.
   Czechoslovaks simply board an overnight tour bus, see Venice by
day and ride home the next night.
   That exhausting form of tourism illustrates the second
difficulty for East Europeans: lack of Western money to spend.
   Nearly all East European countries have revised official
exchange rates to favor Western visitors, but popular demand for
dollars or marks remains so high that black markets still thrive.
   The shortage of hard currency, lure of Western consumer luxury
and comparatively good wages paid in the West for even menial jobs
tempt many East Europeans to work at least part of the time while
abroad.
   West Germany and the United States, with its large Polish
community, are favorite destinations for Poles seeking work that
often pays more in a month than they make at home in a year.
   University graduates in Czechoslovakia, where the communists
made dissident intellectuals into coal stokers, often go to West
Germany to earn marks for a new car, furniture or video recorder.
   Of the estimated 50,000 Bulgarians visiting Greece before it
slowed the visa process, some helped harvest olives for a few days.
   Such arrangements, officially illegal, may not disturb Western
employers, Eastern workers or governments very much. Communism made
finagling a way of life in Eastern Europe and it was bound to move
West when the Iron Curtain fell.
   Regular bending of the rules does worry authorities, however.
   Poles have earned a reputation throughout Europe as peddlers and
smugglers, thanks mainly to a few ``businessmen'' who travel
regularly to Berlin or Vienna.
   Berlin put visa restrictions on Poles at the beginning of July.
In an effort to avert curbs by Austria, the only Western nation
that does not require visas of its citizens, Poland imposed strict
customs controls and invited the Austrians to help enforce them.
   It is harder to stop an educated East European who wants to
leave his country for good.
   The ``brain drain'' is a particular problem for Bulgaria and
Romania, where shattered economies offer little hope of riches or
satisfaction.
   Bulgaria's passport office said more than 10 percent of the
44,105 people with higher education who went abroad from January to
July did not return. Most were under age 40.
   With a rapidly aging population of just under 9 million,
Bulgaria cannot afford such a loss of young talent.
   One-quarter of the 220,000 ethnic Germans in Romania's
Transylvania region have emigrated since free travel became
possible in January.
   Virginia Young, U.S. consul general in Bucharest, estimates
about one-third of the 1.5 million Romanians who have received
passports this year would like to live in America.
   Most lack any of the qualifications for obtaining a visa.
Interviews on emigration requests are backed up to November 1991
for lack of space and staff, Young said.
   Few countries have stopped granting requests for asylum to East
Europeans. ``Romania is a democracy now,'' said Klaus Branch of the
West German Embassy in Bucharest.
   That argument is lost on ordinary East Europeans whose dreary
daily routine has brightened little with the advent of freedom.

   Just turned 21, Christian Slater is still
struggling to get out of high school _ in the movies, that is.
   He was the high school killer in the black comedy ``Heathers.''
Now he's a shy student who uses a pirate radio station to inflame
his fellow high schoolers in ``Pump Up the Volume.''
   ``I'm trying to put high school behind me and age a little
bit,'' smiled Slater, whose innocent face could easily pass for
midteens. ``I think `Pump Up the Volume' will be my last high
school film.
   ``On the set of the movie I was talking in an interview about
how I would like to grow a little bit and play a character who had
a bit of scruffiness to him, a little bit older. Then along came
`Young Guns 2,' which was perfect.''
   In ``Pump Up the Volume,'' Slater is a newcomer to an Arizona
school, a total outsider who nevertheless communicates with his
frenetic, X-rated rantings and heavy-metal music on his makeshift
radio station. The New Line Cinema film is obviously aimed at the
young crowd, but the star has some impressive, high-pitch scenes
before the microphone.
   He can even find a message in the movie: ``It deals with freedom
of speech, expressing yourself, saying what you really feel in
situations, and of just being the best you can be and not being
afraid.''
   On ``Young Guns 2,'' Slater was the new kid in the block that
included Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips
from the first movie.
   ``There was no feeling of being tested or anything,'' said
Slater. ``I felt immediately accepted into that group. They were
very supportive.
   ``I was the new rider, and I had a lot of catching up to do,
working with the guns. Kiefer was fast on the draw; we had a lot of
races. Luckily, we weren't given real bullets. Lou was an excellent
rider, and he was teaching me different mounts and feeling
comfortable in the saddle again.
   ``Riding is a difficult thing. If you have a moment of lapse of
concentration, the horse can spook, anything can happen, which is
what I think happened to Lou.'' Late in filming, Diamond almost
strangled on a rope when his horse ran away; the actor managed to
escape with only a broken arm.
   Slater has been acting almost from birth. The son of stage and
TV actor Michael Hawkins and Mary Jo Slater, now a casting agent,
he was three months old when his mother brought him onstage in a
play. According to family legend, she held him aloft and declared,
``This is your life, my son.''
   The boy was 9 when he was chosen to appear with Dick Van Dyke in
a revival of ``The Music Man.'' He followed with ``Macbeth'' (Nicol
Williamson), ``David Copperfield,'' ``Merlin,'' ``Sherlock Holmes''
(Frank Langella), plus a number of TV specials.
   Slater's big break came at 16: as Sean Connery's youthful
sidekick in ``The Name of the Rose.''
   ``My first film was `The Legend of Billie Jean,' '' he recalled.
``Then to do `The Name of the Rose' and play a 14th-century monk
just didn't seem like it made any sense to me. I didn't think there
was a prayer of making the transition.
   ``But it turned out to be the greatest experience I've ever had.
I was in awe of Mr. Connery, and he lived up to every expectation I
had of James Bond. I loved him, he was great.''
   The script called for the young man to be seduced by a lusty
wench. He has a brief, interrupted love scene with co-star Ellen
Greene in ``Pump Up the Volume.'' Otherwise, Slater tries to avoid
graphic sex.
   ``I'm sometimes in the situation where a director will ask to
expose a little more than I feel is necessary,'' he said. ``I just
say, `I don't feel I ever need to do it again, unless I truly feel
it is necessary.' I felt it was necessary in `The Name of the
Rose,' and it was done beautifully. I truly feel it is behind me.
Literally.''

<HEAD>``Today'' Graduate John Palmer Starts ``Instant Recall''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Network stars scrambled to get into Iraq for
more hot news on the Middle East crisis. But John Palmer, late of
``Today,'' was here, working on a show about somewhat older stories.
   Like stories that go as far back as 30 years, sometimes farther.
   The show: ``Instant Recall,'' a half-hour, daily series which
goes into production on Aug. 27. Sold to about 75 stations, it will
premiere on Sept. 3. Perchance it might someday chronicle the
``Today'' show?
   ``That would be spell-binding television,'' laughs Palmer, who
left NBC News in March after 26 years there. His final years were
as the ``Today'' news anchor until Deborah Norville was given the
job in September.
   That shift touched off a certain amount of uproar that increased
when Norville succeeded Jane Pauley as co-anchor. ``Today'' has
been second in ratings since Pauley left in January to begin life
anew in prime time.
   Palmer, a respected newsman who at one time was NBC's White
House correspondent, began his life anew as host of a syndicated
series, originally called ``Only Yesterday.''
   Its name later was changed to ``Instant Recall'' lest the series
be thought of as perhaps too much of a stroll down memory lane, he
says.
   It does have ``a veneer of nostalgia,'' he says, but it's
basically a look back at stories, not all earth-shaking, that have
affected the lives of people, with some of those people narrating
the pieces.
   The stories, followed by a segment called ``Shared
Recollections: John Palmer's Diary,'' are about such varied things
as:
   _A 1944 circus fire in Hartford, Conn., that killed 138 people.
   _The toymaker who in 1977 scaled the heights of New York's World
Trade Center the hard way _ from the outside _ and was asked for
his autograph by two cops sent to arrest him.
   _Hurricane Carla in 1961 and CBS anchorman Dan Rather's memories
of covering it for the Houston station where he began his TV career.
   There'll be two main stories per show, each starting with what
Palmer calls ``a time capsule, memory triggers that put the viewer
in the setting,'' and a lot of music from the year in which the
story occurred.
   ``It stands or falls on the basis of the quality of the
stories,'' Palmer says. ``There are no re-creations. It's all
actual news footage.''
   Palmer isn't the only network graduate working on the show.
   Its executive producer is former ABC News Vice President Av
Westin, the senior producer is Dan Cooper, formerly of ABC's
``20-20,'' and ``there are a lot of people here from CBS and NBC,''
Palmer says.
   But now and then, the 54-year-old journalist does miss those of
the old gang who still are working at NBC News: ``I feel kind of a
longing, sometimes, for a lot of terribly good friends.
   ``But I must say this. I was was thinking the other day what a
difference a year makes _ that Jane Pauley and I both have our new
programs, we can both sleep later, and if my show is half as
successful as hers, I would be very, very happy.''
   He still keeps in touch with the former ``Today'' co-anchor, who
has had ratings success this summer with her ``Real Life With Jane
Pauley'' series of specials.
   He also still considers ``Today'' weatherman Willard Scott a
friend, likewise the show's prickly anchor, Bryant Gumbel. About
the show's much-written-about woes, Palmer has this to say:
   ``It wasn't a screwup of the cast. It was management.''
   Although when he left NBC he admitted he found that ``a little
scary,'' he has no regrets now: ``Not one morning have I awakened,
feeling, `Hey, maybe you did the wrong thing.'
   ``Win, lose or draw, this was right, and this is the right
time.''

<HEAD>Rick Nelson Biography Shows Charmed Life Gone Sour</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELISABETH DUNHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet,''
one of the most watched shows in television history, was the
perfect vehicle for the budding music career of the sitcom's
teen-age star.
   An awkward lip-synced performance of ``I'm Walkin' '' blasted
Ricky Nelson to the top of the charts a few weeks after the episode
aired, with 60,000 copies of the single sold in three days.
   Years later, the same TV teen-idol image would obscure Rick's
status as an important figure in pop music history: the last link
to genuine rock 'n' roll and the progenitor of California rock.
   ``The association with the television show was death to Rick.
That, more than anything, is what did him in as far as his image
went,'' said San Francisco rock critic Joel Selvin, author of a
biography of Rick Nelson, whose 1985 death in an airplane crash
shocked the nation.
   ``There is no way you could survive coming out of Ozzie and
Harriet and be seen as a real, authentic rock and roller.''
   Nelson's death is still linked in the public's mind to his
cocaine use. In ``Ricky Nelson, Idol for a Nation'' (Contemporary
Books, $18.95), Selvin attempts to set the record straight.
   The plane crash initially was tied to alleged cocaine freebasing
aboard the craft. However, a few weeks after the crash, Selvin
writes, ``the investigation focused almost exclusively on the
troublesome heater in the rear of the passenger cabin. The
testimony was released to the press, but headlines about the heater
starting the fire didn't make quite the splash the freebasing rumor
did two months before.''
   In the biography, Selvin emphasizes the significance of Ricky's
``California rockabilly,'' a genre he began, and how his
``charmed'' youth produced a nightmarish adulthood, marred by heavy
drug use and a roller coaster career.
   The book starts with witness descriptions of the Texas crash of
a World War II-vintage Douglas DC-3 that killed the singer, his
girlfriend and some band members. It flashes back to Ozzie and
Harriet's early years together, then traces their son's life and
career, winding up with his star-studded funeral.
   Detailed attention is given to Ricky's late 1950s recordings,
which Selvin says ``rank easily with the best of Buddy Holly, the
Everly Brothers and Elvis.''
   Selvin takes the reader to the Lew Chudd-produced sessions for
Imperial Records that created ``Waitin' in School,'' ``Stood Up,''
``Believe What You Say'' and ``My Bucket's Got a Hole in It,'' many
featuring the stinging solos of guitar great James Burton.
   The book also looks at the darker side of the performer's life:
a humdrum acting career, a deeply troubled marriage to Kristin
Harmon and, finally, his last days as an isolated drug addict, so
burned out that he wore makeup when he ventured from his Mulholland
Drive home.
   Selvin, a critic for the San Francisco Chronicle for the past 18
years, said he's been a Nelson fan since the early 1970s, when the
singer won acclaim for his work with the country-rock Stone Canyon
Band. The same era produced ``Garden Party,'' the only outstanding
song Rick wrote.
   ``That song connected with the most important emotional issue of
his life: the lack of acknowledgement for his authentic musical
accomplishments,'' Selvin said.
   Research and writing the book took six months, much of which the
author spent interviewing friends and musicians who worked with
Rick.
   Aside from older brother David Nelson, who ``sat still'' for a
few interviews, the family ``was no help whatsoever,'' Selvin said.
Harriet Nelson and Harmon refused to meet with the biographer.
   ``It's a funny thing about the Nelson family. Wherever you go,
people have a little story. David has the same story. It starts
with the phrase: `They were just like the TV show,' which is just
not so. Ricky would have been the first to say that,'' Selvin said.
   Though much of the book will appeal to music history buffs,
Selvin digs up enough dirt to draw in fans of tell-all Hollywood
biographies. He depicts the hard-working Ozzie Nelson as a
domineering, stifling influence on his sons.
   Whereas the Nelsons of TV-land were a nice, normal middle-class
family, the real Nelsons were millionaires, Hollywood elite. On the
show, David was a lawyer. In reality, he flunked out of high
school, Selvin said.
   The Ricky of Ozzie's show was a clean teen who rarely crossed
his parents. The real Ricky had some rebellious, dark periods, at
one point dating a bisexual heroin addict he ``took away'' from his
brother, according to Selvin.
   Some of the book's best detail was provided by Forrest Stewart,
Ricky's close friend during his teen years, and Chester Golasinski,
Rick's housekeeper in the years before he died. Golansinski
witnessed the singer's seclusion with drug-addicted fiancee Helen
Blair, who also died in the plane crash.

   Did the owner of a Nevada diner really contrive
to create a fifth television network, featuring programming about
sympathetic serial killers and laugh-a-minute Watergate antics? Of
course not. But in the world of television, as this look at a
fictitious network suggests, just about anything can happen.

   It was television history in the making, but we
didn't know it then. We couldn't have known, could we?
   How could we forsee that O.C. ``King'' Cole, the bluff,
eccentric tycoon of the Syncline, Nev.-based Last Gas Diner empire
would quietly liquidate his fortune and buy five UHF TV stations in
the top U.S. markets?
   ``I was inspired,'' Cole told TV Guide before his disappearance
triggered the international manhunt. ``If Fox could come out of
nowhere and rip off 10 percent of the TV audience, I reckon I
could, too.'' And so he did.
   Who could have foreseen that unforgettable first season? Who'd
have thought Tom Selleck could play a handsome, wise-cracking
serial killer and become America's No. 1 TV idol and People
magazine's ``Sexiest Man Alive''?
   Who'd have thought ``Yow, that smarts, Haldemann!'' would become
a catch phrase for the nation?
   How did it happen? How did upstart Fifth Broadcasting Co.
confound the Big Four and launch that memorable programming?
``Programming? Try horse pucky,'' Cole would chortle. And how did
he keep it on the air?
   That's a mystery, like his whereabouts, which still preoccupies
sociologists, Ted Turner, the IRS, organized crime, Brandon
Tartikoff, 17 state and federal grand juries and six Cayman Islands
banks still holding his paper.
   USA Today, in its thoughtful, 450-word profile ``Cole: TV Genius
or Maniac?'', noted that Cole analyzed the Big Four's programming
strategies, discovered their weaknesses and devised specific
tactics to exploit them.
   ``Ratings-wise, Fridays and Saturdays were squat,'' Cole said.
``Fox had Sundays. CBS had Mondays until ABC's football season. NBC
won Thursdays after Bart Simpson murdered his family. Friday was
ABC's. What was left?''
   Thus was born ``the Fifth Wednesday'' and Cole's strategy to win
it: Ignore the audiences you don't want and program only for those
you do.
   ``Not only would we go for the 12- to 34-year-olds just like Fox
had,'' Cole said, ``but we would go for the 50- to 64-year-olds,
too.'' At the time, Cole's view was heresy on Madison Avenue. Soon
the agencies paid attention.
   Cole knew it was our largely ignored elders who watch the most
TV _ 33 hours a week _ and had the fewest dependents, highest
disposable income and most intense fantasies involving Angela
Lansbury.
   ``We're talking about an audience that would indeed purchase a
laxative, tropical fruit-flavored bubble gum which doesn't adhere
to one's dental work,'' Cole told The New York Times in its
thoughtful, 4,500-word profile.
   The sticky part was programming. How could Fifth nail that
crossover show that would transcend demographic barriers? As Cole
reminisced in his final interview, ``All the really lame concepts
were taken. ...
   ``Who'd buy another perfect, well-adjusted, upper middle-class
black family? Or an overweight, wise-cracking working-class white
family? Or a Boston bar filled with regulars who don't have
drinking problems? Get serious, boy.
   ``Where was the show with that `thirtysomething-Simpsons-Twin
Peaks' feel?''
   Cole searched in vain for the right production team until he
heard about two brothers, ex-pornography producers whose sitcom
``Shoot the Moon'' was rejected by a Fox executive as ``utterly
tasteless, cruel, sexist jokes about vile body functions. And
besides, we already have `Married ... with Children.'''
   For Roy and Darryl Pander, Cole's call was a godsend. Wanted in
Cincinnati, the brothers flew to Hollywood (drove, actually, but
the warrant read ``interstate flight'') to take a meeting. They
quickly cut a deal.
   ``Cole? What can I say about the guy except, hey, he's THE
guy,'' said Darryl, the shorter, fatter one with glasses. ``He gave
us a break before anybody even knew David Lynch stole `Twin Peaks'
from us back at USC Film School.''
   Pander Bros. Productions began work on ``Where's Harry,'' with
Roy as writer-director and Darryl as producer. Their earlier career
had taught them how to mount a mobile, small-scale production that
could shoot in motel rooms.
   Selleck, virtually wiped out by business reverses and the
Detroit Tigers' move to Mexico City, reluctantly agreed to head the
cast. He was certain the role of Harry Unman meant the end of his
career as an actor.
   ``I play a serial killer who cares,'' Selleck said in many
interviews. ``I'd go to a town, get a job, settle in, form
relationships and _ sure enough _ that lunar cycle would kick in
and I'd have to leave town again. Fast.''
   So did the Panders, running up big bills in exotic,
out-of-the-way locales. Roy's curiously unformed scripts were
studded with great gags, but forced Selleck to improvise constantly.
   Selleck, careworn, graying and challenged for the first time as
an actor, used his financial worries and his personal charm to
create a compellingly believable psychopath _ and won unprecedented
twin Emmys for comedy and drama.
   It was ``splendid television,'' TV writers wrote. ``Brechtian
and off-putting ... a tortured Huck Finn,'' raved the Times. ``A
`Fugitive' for the '90s! A date with Harry you'll always
remember!'' gushed TV Guide.
   With ``Where's Harry'' an established hit, Cole became an
instant billionaire when he turned Fifth Broadcasting into a
publicly held company and grabbed up another five UHF stations in
the Top 10 markets.
   Cole went to the Pacific Rim animation industry for his second
hit, ``The Muriyakis,'' a Japan-bashing cartoon show about an
alienated, hard-working, Japanese family whose wise-cracking
Papa-san buys Manhattan.
   The Pander brothers, meanwhile, hit again with ``Watergate: The
Comedy.''
   From the opening credits in that dank parking garage when Deep
Throat hoarsely murmured ``Follow the money!'' while wearing
Groucho nose-glasses, TV viewers knew they were in for the sitcom
of the decade.
   ``America is ready to laugh again at its Constitution,'' wrote
one enthralled critic. ``It is Dabney Coleman's greatest role _ or
was it Nixon's?'' wrote another. Libel lawsuits flew far and wide,
but in vain.
   The panicked networks, their audience shares eroding even
further, began frantic counter-programming: ``Perverts,'' ``Space
Rats!'' ``Two's A Crowd Starring Beppo the Clown'' and ``The Great
American Sex Quiz'' lowered television's nadir.
   It was too late for the American economy when the Securities and
Exchange Commission burst the bubble and suspended trading on
Fifth. ``It is nothing more than a massive Ponzi scheme, paying its
investors with the money of other investors,'' the SEC thundered.
   Cole, named in a 127-count federal indictment for stock fraud,
wire fraud and conspiracy, as well as a Cincinnati porn charge,
dropped out of sight faster and deeper than the Dow Jones
industrial averages on that ``Black Wednesday.''
   His whereabouts remain unknown to this day, although officials
in French Guiana last year arrested O.C. ``Bub'' Castetter, a fry
cook from Syncline, Nev., and claim he is the vanished TV tycoon.
   Castetter, fighting extradition to the United States, refuses to
comment.
   The U.S. economy has recovered, but the still-dwindling network
TV audience has shrunk to 37 percent of potential viewers and no
one seems to care.

<TEXT>
   Local militiamen and soldiers from
neighboring Zimbabwe stand guard over a pipeline, railroad and
crumbling highway. In the soporific heat, they talk of past
campaigns and the possibility of peace.
   There was a time when the enemy, an ubiquitous rebel army
accused of many atrocities, launched attacks of 1,000 men on the
three facilities, which are lifelines to the sea for Mozambique's
inland neighbors.
   For the last few months, quiet has prevailed in the Beira
Corridor ascending from the port of Beira, through nearly 200 miles
of fertile savanna flecked with forests and swamps, to the Vumba
Mountains of Zimbabwe.
   Observers suggest the rebels, who remain active on either side
of the zone, prefer to attack poorly equipped government troops
rather than the heavily armed Zimbabwean military.
   ``We have a few firings along the road, that's all,'' said Col.
Michael Dube, one of the men commanding several thousand Zimbabwean
soldiers who have helped guard the transportation corridor since
1984.
   About 12,000 Zimbabwean troops are scattered throughout
Mozambique to help government forces.
   Dube's troops make routine seven-day foot patrols from Lamego, a
mosquito-infested base camp on the edge of swamps about 45 miles
inland from the Indian Ocean coast.
   Armored convoys run another 110 miles westward to the Zimbabwean
brigade headquarters at Chimoio, just across the border, carrying
supplies to the soldiers and Mozambican militia posts.
   The corridor has remained open through most of the war, closing
only long enough for repairs to the railway after mine explosions
and other sabotage by the guerrillas, who began fighting in 1977.
   Two Beira-bound trains trundle along the corridor most days,
carrying potash and railroad ties from Botswana, tin and cobalt
from Zaire and Zimbabwean tobacco and granite. Trucks overloaded
with Zambian copper pound along the highway.
   Western donors and investors have contributed more than $400
million since 1986 for repairs to the transport system and
rebuilding Beira's port and infrastructure.
   Keeping soldiers in Mozambique costs Zimbabwe about $20 million
a year, according to official figures, and up to seven times that
by private estimates. Zimbabwe is infinitely better off than
Mozambique, but still is among the world's poorer nations.
   White settlers who ruled Zimbabwe when it was a British colony
called Rhodesia helped establish the rebel force to fight
Mozambique's Marxist government. Mozambique became independent of
Portugal in 1975, two years before Renamo was formed.
   South Africa later became Renamo's main supporter, with the aim
of undermining Mozambique economically, and openly supported the
guerrillas until the two governments signed a peace agreement in
1984. No government now acknowledges aiding Renamo.
   President Joachim Chissano's ruling party, known as Frelimo,
officially dropped its hard-line Marxist policies in 1989. In July,
the government said Mozambique's first multiparty elections would
be held next year.
   Renamo has demanded recognition by the government and free
Western-style elections, but has not made its political aims clear.
The guerrillas will be allowed to participate in the 1991 elections
if they lay down their arms.
   The war has killed an estimated 600,000 Mozambicans, displaced
more than 1 million and made the southeast African nation one of
the poorest in the world. Nearly half the 15 million people require
some food assistance and per capita income is less than $200 a year.
   Peace talks have begun in Rome between the government and exiled
rebel leaders, but Col. Dube's men wait for peace with little cheer
or optimism.
   He and his junior officers sipped Dao, a cheap Portuguese red
wine, in a tidy dining tent and said peace would not come easily.
   Zimbabwean soldiers, with their far superior firepower,
equipment and air support, have little faith in Mozambican
government troops.
   ``When there's trouble, the first thing Frelimo do is run
away,'' said Dube, a Soviet-trained veteran of his own country's
war for independence, which ended a decade ago.
   A young officer, who asked not to be identified, said
militiamen, soldiers and rebels alike turned to banditry.
   The Zimbabweans have been accused of using armored vehicles,
which are seldom searched, to smuggle out ivory, gemstones,
valuable carvings and marijuana, which grows wild in central and
northern Mozambique.

   Potholes the size of bathtubs pit the
streets. Plumbing and electricity fade from reality to memory.
Thousands of squatters live in the once-elegant Grand Hotel.
   The smell of too many people in too little space drifts on a
lazy Indian Ocean breeze over a city built for 60,000 people that
has become a home of sorts to 400,000, most of them squatters.
   At the Grand Hotel, everthing burnable was pillaged from the
casino long ago, for cooking and warmth. Vast chandeliers, of no
use as fuel, still hang in the ballroom and lobby, shrouded in dust.
   Beira has fallen victim to one of Africa's longest and deadliest
conflicts, which has killed an estimated 600,000 people and
displaced 1 million, many of whom have fled to refugee camps in
neighboring countries.
   First, the nation was convulsed by 10 years of fighting between
the colonial armies of Portugal and neighboring Zimbabwe, then
white-ruled Rhodesia, against Marxist guerrillas of the Frelimo
movement.
   Frelimo led the country to independence in 1975 and, two years
later, the brutal Renamo rebel movement began a guerrilla war that
still continues.
   In Beira, ``people are scratching to survive,'' said Chris
Notley, a British-born aid worker.
   In the first years of black rule, Marxist governments
nationalized key enterprises and private property throughout this
southeast African nation.
   At least 120,000 Portuguese settlers fled the northern
provinces. They burned farms, homes and vehicles, sabotaged
factories and plugged toilets and drains with concrete.
   The government has begun opening to the West, and some signs of
revival can be seen in Beira.
   Foreign businesses are negotiating with provincial authorities
take over businesses, buildings and land in and around the city.
   Electricians are trying to untangle the city's neglected wiring.
The unused golf course, mown for the first time in 14 years when
Pope John Paul II visited Beira in 1988, now is groomed more often.
   Aid workers expect recovery to be slow. One reason, they say, is
a crushing bureacracy inherited from Portuguese colonialists and
administrators supplied by East Germany after independence.
   ``Mozambicans learned about bureacracy from Portugal, the most
backward country in Europe,'' said Erik Greby, a Danish aid
executive involved in rehabilitating the harbor. ``Put the most
backward East Bloc system on top of that _ that's why nothing works
here.''

   China's economy is sluggish, verging on
recession, but exports are booming.
   Foreign investment has lagged since the brutal crackdown on
dissent more than a year ago. Businessmen still worry about
political instability and are put off by numerous roadblocks to
profitable joint venturess the bright spot in the Chinese economy,'' a
Western
diplomat said, on condition of anonymity. ``If the current trend
keeps up, this year's may be the biggest trade surplus .
   ``Trade iin China's
history.''
   Total trade rose 8.6 percent in 1989 to $111.5 billion. From
January through June this year, the $25.65 billion in exports
exceeded imports by $2.56 billion. Economists predict a $10 billion
surplus for 1990, nearly double the record 1982 surplus of $5.63
billion.
   More industries produce goods for export because economic
problems have shrunk domestic markets. Economists say China also is
pushing exports in order to repay foreign loans, many of which are
due in 1992.
   Led by its freewheeling southern coastal provinces, China is
exporting more to the United States than ever before, despite
international censure of the harsh action against pro-democracy
demonstrators in June 1989.
 y Japan is warming to
Communist China and lagging in help for the economically strapped
Soviet Union.
   ``Japan invaded China and caused widespread death, destruction
and devastation,'' former Foreign Minister Saburo Okita wrote
recently, recalling the occupation of China half a century ago.
``Japanese feel guilt about China, not about the Soviet Union.''
   What may be a short march back to normal relations with Beijing
began when Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu announced last month that
Japan will gradually restore a five-year package of loans worth 810
billion yen ($5.4 billion).
   The loan program was frozen as part of international sanctions
after the crackdown of June 1989. Reports say it will resume this
fall, restoring Japan to its role as the biggest source of foreign
credit to China.
   Analysts say the economic benefit to Japan of the restored loans
could be limited. Although sagging trade could pick up if the
Chinese economy revives, Japanese businessmen are nervous about
investing in a country whose political situation is unsettled.
   In explaining Japanese policy, Kaifu has said regional stability
requires that China not be isolated. Historically, Japan has valued
good relations with Beijing as a counter to Soviet influence.
   Because of the cruel Japanese occupation of China during World
War II, it is difficult for Japan to continue protesting China's
human rights violations.
   Tokuma Utsunomiya, a member of Parliament who heads the
Japan-China Friendship Society, has pointed out that Japanese
soldiers killed many more Chinese civilians than the People's
Liberation Army did on the night of June 3-4, 1989.
   For example, more than 100,000 civilians and prisoners of war
were slaughtered in Nanking, then capital of China, after the
Japanese captured it in late 1937.
   Debate about easing sanctions against China has been muted here,
compared with the loud criticism in Congress of President George
Bush's decision to extend most-favored-nation trading status to
Beijing.
   ``When a poor country is developing, there may well be times
when national unity and stability take priority over human
rights,'' Okita wrote in an essay for the International Herald
Tribune. The former foreign minister is chairman of the Institute
for Domestic and International Policy Studies in Tokyo.
   Government officials also are keenly aware that China did not
demand reparations for war damage, which Utsunomiya of the
Japan-China Friendship Society estimated at $50 billion or more.
   ``Japan has a responsibility to help China's modernization''
because of the ruinous occupation, Utsunomiya, 85, said in an
interview. ``This is different from the situation of the
industrialized countries in the West.''
   Japan is not the only nation warming to China. Indonesia
restored full diplomatic relations this month and Saudi Arabia
switched recognition to Beijing from Taiwan, where the ruling
Nationalist Party still claims to be the rightful government of all
China.
   Even tension between Taiwan and China has eased with growing
business and civilian ties.
   The change in Japan's attitude is particularly important because
it is one of the democratic economic powers that agreed to impose
sanctions.
   Among other signs that Kaifu's government wants better relations
is a decision not to renew visas for vocal Chinese dissidents
living in Japan. The activists recently told Western reporters the
Japanese were using them as pawns.
   A Japan-China Investment Promotion Organization was formed in
March with government support.
   Several former Cabinet members have gone to Beijing to meet with
Premier Li Peng about the impending economic aid, and an official
delegation flew to Beijing in late July to work out details.
   There has been speculation that top officials soon will visit
China, even though such trips would violate last summer's agreement
among leading industrial nations.
   ``The Japanese will find some method by which to restore
high-level contacts'' by early 1991, a Western diplomat said.
   Utsunomiya believes Japan's resumption of aid will help improve
the position of Chinese who favor economic reform and are trying to
recuperate from the conservative backlash that followed the
crackdown on dissent.
   ``I completely agree that China should develop democracy, but
right now the country is in a backward condition,'' he said.
``Japan should first help China develop its economy . . . and
democracy can then grow from that base.''

   Late July: George Steinbrenner is still
running the Yankees, the governor of Louisiana is deciding whether
to veto an abortion bill and the first tropical disturbance of
summer, a storm named Arthur, makes its appearance in the Caribbean.
   The American press seems bent on finding out who David Souter is
and what his thoughts are about abortion. President Bush has just
nominated him to the Supreme Court.
   Few Americans much notice that Saddam Hussein of Iraq is
accusing his small neighbors of harboring an ``imperial-Zionist
plan'' to drive down the price of oil.
   Don't blame yourself if you missed the rumblings that were to
suddenly put the United States on war footing and land a vast
military force on the searing Saudi desert, where American troops
had never before been welcomed.
   What led to that, the quarrel between Iraq and its little
neighbor, Kuwait, just seemed like another of those wrangles over
oil production and pricing that occur before the meetings of OPEC
sheiks and statesmen.
   Oil? Wasn't there a glut?
   War? Wasn't this the era of the peace dividend?
   The oil glut was the problem for Saddam Hussein of Iraq. After
eight years of war with Iran, ended by a cease-fire, his country
was powerful but broke. Oil prices and oil revenues were falling.
   Saddam found a pair of villains _ Kuwait, his wartime supporter
and financier, and the United Arab Emirates. Kuwait is just across
the border; the UAE is tucked away on the other side of Saudi
Arabia.
   Kuwait and the UAE were in fact, as Saddam Hussein charged,
exceeding their OPEC oil production quotas by over a million
barrels a day and thus helping to keep oil prices depressed. Oil
was bringing $14 a barrel, 20 percent lower than the year before.
   That was the background to the events that brought out the
battleships, the troops _ and the gas masks.
   July 17: Saddam uses the 22nd anniversary of the coup that
brought his Baath Party to power to lay out his demands. He wants
Kuwait to forgive $15 billion in loans extended during the
Iran-Iraq war. And he wants Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to
pay $14 billion to compensate for what he says Iraq lost due to low
oil prices.
   ``If words fail to protect Iraqis, something effective must be
done to return things to their natural course and return usurped
rights to their owners,'' he says. ``Iraqis will not forget the
maxim that cutting necks is better than cutting the means of
living. Oh, God Almighty, be witness that we have warned them.''
   July 18: A letter from Saddam's foreign minister to the Arab
League accuses Kuwait of having stolen $2.4 billion worth of
petroleum over the past decade from an Iraqi oil field along the
two nations' disputed border.
   Kuwait puts its 20,000-man army on alert.
   July 19: Kuwait cancels its state of alert. ``It was all a
summer cloud that has been blown away,'' says an unidentified
Kuwaiti source who turns out to be monumentally wrong.
   July 20: Thousands of Kuwaiti workers in Iraq, sensing trouble,
head home.
   July 22: A pro-government newspaper in Iran, in a surprise show
of support for a former enemy, says a ``means of punishment against
quota violators seems a necessity.''
   July 23: Unconfirmed reports say that Iraq has massed 30,000
troops to its border and that the Pentagon has put its warships in
the Persian Gulf on alert.
   July 24: Iraq accuses Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil. Kuwait
reinstates its alert. The Pentagon announces naval exercises in the
Persian Gulf.
   July 25: President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, seeking to carve out
a peacemaker's role, says Iraq and Kuwait have agreed to send
delegations to the Saudi Arabian summer capital of Jiddah to
discuss their differences.
   July 27: At a tense meeting in Geneva, OPEC agrees to limit oil
production and raise its target price by $3 to $21 a barrel. Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates promise to abide by the new production
quotas. Because of Iraq's threats to use force against countries
that ignore the limits, industry observers expect the measure, this
time, to stick.
   In Washington, the House and Senate defy Bush administration
opposition and vote for economic sanctions against Iraq. These
reflect an accumulation of complaints over Iraq's attempt to
intimidate neighbors, its human rights record, its use of poison
gas during the Iran-Iraq war against its Kurdish minority, its
drive to build nuclear weapons. The State Department says the votes
will not be helpful to diplomatic efforts to modify Saddam's
behavior.
   Aug. 1 _ Talks in Jiddah start with an embrace. But two hours
later, they break off. The Iraqi delegation walks out, saying they
did not sense ``any seriousness'' from the Kuwaitis. Tensions _ and
oil prices _ rise.
   Aug. 2 (7 p.m. EDT Aug. 1) _ Tank-led Iraqi infantry units storm
into Kuwait. They advance unchecked down a highway across the flat
desert terrain to the capital, Kuwait city.
   The Financial Times says the advance is so unchallenged that
some troops travelled down the road by bus. The emir, Sheik Jabir,
flees by helicopter. Kuwait's hopelessly outnumbered troops wage
pitched battles around the sheik's residential palace. The sheik's
younger brother is reported to have been killed defending the
palace.
   Kuwait's crown prince and premier, Sheik Saad al-Abdallah Al
Sabah, goes on the radio and television and calls for resistance:
``Let them taste the chalice of death.''
   Kuwait calls for urgent American military assistance but Iraq
threatens to turn Kuwait into a ``graveyard'' if an outside power
intervenes.
   The invasion seems to catch Washington by surprise, but the CIA
takes the unusual step of issuing a statement saying it was not
surprised and had ``provided policy-makers with very useful and
timely information.''
   President Bush reacts swiftly. First he condemns Saddam's
``naked aggression.'' Then he engineers a United Nations-sanctioned
embargo of Iraq. Finally, he commits massive American force, the
largest dispatched since the Vietnam war, to protect Saudi Arabia
from Kuwait's fate. He says they will serve until Saddam withdraws
from Kuwait.
   By now the story has captured America's attention. The latest
developments are writ large on the front pages.

   Another crisis, another round of demands for a
national energy policy to insulate Americans against recurrent oil
shocks. It's all happened before.
   ``By failing to learn from the lessons of history, we are
condemning ourselves to repeat it,'' said Sen. Lloyd M. Bentsen,
D-Tex., arguing that there ought to be a law requiring emergency
measures before oil imports hit 50 percent of U.S. consumption.
   It's too late, of course, as Bentsen noted.
   Imports were running at about 50 percent before the latest
Persian Gulf crisis erupted with Iraq's takeover of Kuwait.
   As in 1973 and in 1979, the United States faces rising oil
prices. And though there's no immediate prospect of those kinds of
shortages, they could come eventually. The earlier oil shocks were
major factors in triggering recessions. The economy already is
slowing, and the current turmoil in the Persian Gulf can only make
it worse.
   Despite what happened before, and despite the virtual certainty
that something similar would happen again, U.S. efforts at energy
discipline were shelved for most of a decade. Ronald Reagan's
energy policy was to leave it alone, and let the market rule. That
sufficed while Middle East oil was plentiful and relatively cheap.
Now the problem is back.
   ``We have spent the last decade basking in the glow of falling
real energy prices,'' Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., said before
the Senate passed its energy policy bill early this month. ``We
have been lulled into a complacency that cannot last.''
   During the Reagan administration, the Department of Energy's
conservation budget was slashed by two-thirds.
   When imported oil prices fell in 1986, U.S. production fell,
too. At those prices, many domestic producers couldn't compete, and
there was no incentive to keep going. U.S. oil production is down
by about 20 percent since 1985. At 7.1 million barrels a day, June
production was the lowest on record.
   Remnants of the emergency programs that grew out of the crises
of the 1970s have put the United States in better shape to deal
with the impact of the Persian Gulf situation.
   One of those legacies is the emergency petroleum reserve, a big
enough stockpile to temporarily cushion against shortages. It could
be a lot bigger if the government hadn't stopped buying during five
of the Reagan years, a budget-cutting move that could prove
expensive.
   The 1987 tanker war in the Persian Gulf threatened oil supplies,
and U.S. warships were sent to protect the supply lines. That
costly operation isn't calculated into the price of oil, nor is
this one. They go onto the tax bill, not the price at the pump.
   Sen. Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, calculated that counting the
cost of earlier military operations, the true price of imported oil
comes to $52 a barrel. That hypothetical price tag doesn't include
the cost of the massive U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia and
the Persian Gulf.
   Figured that way, the price is soaring with the U.S. military
deployment in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf. ``This is not a freebie
out there in terms of the expenditure,'' President Bush said
Tuesday, saying he could not estimate the cost or the duration of
the operation.
   But people don't count those costs the way they count the cost
of a gallon of gasoline.
   Oil imports are a major factor in the U.S. trade deficit. James
Schlesinger, a former secretary of energy and of defense, says the
price will hit $75 billion next year, swelling to over $100 billion
a year by the mid-1990s if past trends continue.
   Through it all, U.S. energy policy has shifted and drifted.
Richard M. Nixon's Project Independence made little headway toward
the goal in its name. Jimmy Carter said the quest to curb energy
dependence was the moral equivalent of war. His program of
conservation and production incentives, fees, taxes and penalties
didn't last long. The Reagan administration relied on the
marketplace. The Bush administration still is at work on its energy
strategy, due later this year.
   And as Carter notes, the Arab oil suppliers know only too well
that ``we now have no effective national energy policy, nor any
commitment to adopt one.''
   Legislation to declare that oil imports of 50 percent represent
a ``peril point'' for U.S. security, and to require emergency
action to keep them lower is part of a new National Energy Security
Act passed by the Senate just before its August recess, two days
after Iraq invaded Kuwait. The timing was coincidental; the bill
was drafted primarily to deal with global warming, not oil wars.
   A measure seeking to restrain oil imports was defeated by the
Senate in 1987 after the last Persian Gulf crisis had subsided.
   Conservation, production incentives, and new technologies to
develop alternative energy sources all have been components in the
successive strategies that were shaped and shelved after the
earlier oil shocks.
   The Department of Energy put together a quick-hit package of
steps to boost production and promote conservation, to offset the
loss of imports from Kuwait and Iraq.
   But between oil crises, the tendency has been to act as though
there wouldn't be another one.

   VALLEY OF 10,000 SMOKES, Alaska (AP) _ They call this
wind-scoured place ``hell with the fires burned out,'' a desert of
pumice and ash piled 700 feet deep by the most powerful series of
volcanic blasts this century.
   Geologists continue trying to sort out the plumbing beneath
Novarupta Volcano, which erupted in June 1912 with a force 10 times
that of the Mount St. Helens explosion a decade ago.
   For the last two summers, a multiagency team of scientists has
been ferrying supplies and equipment by helicopter in and out of
this roadless and unique corner of the 4 million-acre Katmai
National Park and Preserve.
   The area was established in 1918 by President Woodrow Wilson,
who set aside an initial 1,700 square miles to preserve an area of
``importance to the study of volcanism.''
   Scientists want to pinpoint the size, shape and location of the
eruptive vent.
   ``It will help us predict eruptions, find ore deposits and
better understand the earth's process,'' said Tom Miller of the
Alaska Volcano Observatory in Anchorage.
   But because the science is being gathered in a wilderness area,
the project is not without controversy.
   A dozen scientists were tiptoeing around this summer, trying not
to intrude on the wilderness experiences of backpackers trekking
more than a dozen miles to the shelter of two ramshackle huts on
Baked Mountain, near where the volcano is believed centered.
   Men and women who spent years in classrooms and labs earning
their doctorates spent several days on their hands and knees
re-roofing one of the huts as part of an agreement with the
National Park Service.
   The Park Service relaxed its rules for using a helicopter in the
Katmai backcountry in exchange for the work.
   Proposals to drill two holes deep into the body of the
still-warm volcano already have begun drawing fire, although the
environmental impact statement has not yet been written and public
hearings are at least a year away.
   ``I got a couple of letters about it, critical of the drilling a
few days ago,'' said Alan Eliason, Katmai's new superintendent. ``I
think they were written by people who used to work here.''
   When Robert Griggs first saw the valley that he appropriately
named the Valley of 10,000 Smokes, the sounds were deafening as
thousands of fumaroles, or vents, hissed and roared, spitting steam
and heat into the air.
   ``The whole valley as far as the eye could see was full of
hundreds, no thousands _ literally, tens of thousands _ of smokes
curling up from its fissured floor,'' said Griggs, who explored the
Ukak River valley in 1916 for the National Geographic Society.
   The valley is silent now, except for the wind. And most of the
fumaroles were extinct by the 1930s, although hikers can warm their
hands over a few small holes that emit odorless steam clouds near
the Novarupta vent.
   ``There are a couple around here that go about 80 degrees
Fahrenheit,'' John Eichelberger, chief scientist for the project,
said while guiding a reporter around.
   Except for several deep gorges and an endless number of gullies
cut by glacial or snow melt into the tan, brown and orange
moonscape, the 40-square-mile valley appears much as it did after
being cooked 78 years ago.
   The scent of sulfur from nearby Trident Volcano drifts faintly
on the wind as you stand surrounded by evidence of the fury of the
eruption.
   Even the place names tell a story: Baked Mountain. Broken
Mountain. Falling Mountain. Knife Creek.
   All are the physical reminders of an eruption that spawned ash
clouds so thick that they darkened skies over the Atlantic states,
dropped summer temperatures around the Northern Hemisphere an
average of 1.8 degrees and released acid rain on Vancouver, British
Columbia, disintegrating clothes drying on lines.
   ``Half of the eruptive volume blew up, sending ash into the
atmosphere. The other half, with larger fragments, blew a day or so
later and went laterally,'' Eichelberger said.
   ``It (gases, incandescent ash) moved at about 100 miles an hour
and built up hundreds of feet thick in only a few hours. It came
out of the ground at about 1,500 degrees.''
   Miraculously, no one died in the explosions, which were heard
clearly in Juneau, Alaska's capital 750 miles to the south.
   ``It was an exceedingly large and, as these things go,
relatively simple eruption,'' Eichelberger said.
   ``Normally, volcanoes are built up from hundreds of eruptions
over many years. With Katmai it was a single event. That's what
makes it so interesting to study.''
   Scientists can interpret the magnetic and seismic results
they've collected over the two summers of work, but they still
can't ``see'' into the earth, said Miller.
   ``We need to verify it,'' he said, ``and you can only do that
with something a kilometer or more down, and that's done with core
drilling.''

   Ten-year-old Jimmy Highbaugh took a running
jump into the swimming pool at Indian Summer camp.
   ``I like the swimming and food here,'' he said. Then he blurted
out, with a wide smile: ``I'm over my cancer. It came back two
times but I'm over it now.''
   Jimmy, who had Hodgkin's disease, was among 59 cancer-stricken
boys and girls attending Indian Summer for a week this summer. Some
had shaved heads and others had lost limbs.
   But mostly it was like any camp where kids swim, fish, hike _
and act like kids.
   ``It's a chance for them to be pretty normal for a week,'' said
Jack Geil, a diatric oncologist at the University of Kentucky
Medical Center.
   ``Most of the kids they see have the same cancers, like they
have,'' he said. ``They can relate to that. They're doing pretty
much normal things. The ones on therapy see others coming off
therapy.''
   During meals, Geil helped give chemotherapy treatments.
   The camp was one of four of its kind in the nation when it was
started in 1982 by the Lake Cumberland District Cancer Council, an
advisory group of the McDowell Cancer Network. There are more than
100 camps now.
   Campers are charged a $5 registration fee to attend. The $300 it
costs to send a child to the camp is raised through donations and
special projects, according to camp director Gloria Sams.
   Besides fun and games, campers are taught to live with others,
to gain some self-confidence and earn a degree of independence.
   ``It's hard to make excuses when the person sleeping next to you
has gone through the same thing,'' said Sams.
   The campers didn't complain.
   ``I enjoy being around the counselors,'' said Lonnie Johnson,
12, of Lexington. ``They're fun. You're always doing something.
You're never sitting around. It's a lot of fun.''
   The theme for this year's camp was ``Heroes and Superheroes.''
The children were welcomed on the first day by costumed fantasy
superhero characters.
   On day two, they were entertained by animals from the Cincinnati
Zoo and the National Forestry Service. The star attraction was
Smokey the Bear.
   Kentucky basketball coach Rick Pitino spoke to them the third
day. He brought along Bernadette Locke, who was making one of her
first public appearances as his new assistant coach. Pitino's
message: It's all right to depend on each other.
   The fourth day featured 12-year-old Jason Gaes, who wrote ``My
Book For Kids With Cansur'' when he was 7. The book was made into
the Academy Award-winning documentary, ``You Don't Have to Die,''
in 1988.
   ``I told them to never give up,'' said Jason, who survived
Burkitt's lymphoma, a rare form of cancer. ``If you want something
bad enough, you have to go for it.''
   There also were daily hikes up Old Baldy, a limestone ridge and
outcropping atop a 1,400-foot knob above the rolling countryside.
   ``The kids here are very inspirational,'' said Christina Marino,
a Lexington dermatologist. ``It's great to see them put their
illnesses behind them and living normal lives.
   ``Some need extra attention and some will amaze you with what
they can do,'' said Marino, a cancer survivor, counselor and arts
and crafts specialist. ``They're all different but they don't dwell
on their illness.''
   Geralyn Gaes, Jason's mother, believes the camps fill a special
need in helping children overcome their illnesses.
   ``It's real important for kids to see life after treatment for
cancer. You have to come back and you can become carefree again,''
she said. ``It's one child relating to another. Kids helping kids.''

<HEAD>Scientists Change Pigs' Diet, Reduce Saturated Fat Ratio in Meat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The level of saturated fat in pork
declines if hogs are fed cooked soybeans, but the meat tastes just
as good as conventional bacon and chops, researchers report.
   The study was done by scientists at the University of Illinois
and at the Harlan E. Moore Heart Research Foundation of Champaign.
   They say this is another step toward ``designer pigs'' for
consumers who want lean pork with less saturated fat than today's
cuts.
   The key is the diet of hogs, who are fed whole soybeans
processed through an extruder.
   The feed produced pork with a significantly higher ratio of
polyunsaturated to saturated fat _ a 50 percent improvement in pork
chops and a 100 percent improvement in bacon.
   ``We can produce healthier pork and do it in an economical
way,'' said Dennis Leszczynski, a dietitian and food scientist at
the heart foundation. ``And there are no important differences in
animal performance, meat taste, texture, processing or storage.''
   Peter Bechtel, a university meat scientist who worked with
Leszczynski on the project, prepared a report on the findings for a
recent meeting of the American Society of Animal Science in Ames,
Iowa.
   ``Pigs are like humans _ we're all a product of the kind of fat
we eat,'' said Bechtel. ``So we change the ratio of polyunsaturated
fat in the pork by altering the fat that goes in the hogs.''
   The American Heart Association recommends that the ratio of
polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat be 1-to-1, said Leszczynski.
Feeding extruded soybeans improved the ratio from 0.28-to-1 to
0.43-to-1 in pork chops, and from 0.25-to-1 to 0.50-to-1 in bacon,
he said.
   A lean chicken breast has a ratio of 0.83-to-1.
   ``We're getting closer,'' said Leszczynski. ``The challenge now
is to see how much higher we can go without adversely affecting the
meat quality or the economics.''
   ``It is a step in the right direction but a pretty small one,''
said Dean Ornish, director of the Preventive Medicine Research
Institute and member of the faculty of the school of medicine at
the University of California-San Francisco.
   ``It is analogous to going from two packs a day to one pack. The
ideal is to decrease your total fat intake and this does not
accomplish that,'' he said.
   The study involved 160 pigs. Some had a diet that included 20
percent extruded soubeans for the six weeks before slaughter.
   Conventional hog rations contain corn and soybean meal. The
scientists substituted the extruded whole soybeans for the meal in
order to retain soy oil, which is relatively high in
polyunsaturated fat.
   Research at the International Soybean Program at UI has shown
that extrusion not only leaves the oil in the final product, it
also destroys the natural digestive inhibitors in soybeans.
   Bechtel said most Illinois farmers already have soybeans; an
$8,000 extruder could be shared by a group of farmers.
   Some pork producers already deliver leaner animals to market by
selecting breeds that have less fat and slaughtering them before
they get too heavy. That has created pork cuts that are 97 percent
lean.
   Bechtel said his project showed that the composition of the
remaining fat could be improved.
   The final product may cost a little more to produce, so the
researchers said farmers will have to sell processors and consumers
on the health value of their new pork to justify a higher price.

   Sugar has little to offer in the way of nutrient value. For its
calories (16 per teaspoon), sugar provides no vitamins or minerals
that are essential to good health.
   But is sugar one of the culprits in disease? Does eating too
much sugar lead to obesity? What is the role of sugar in the onset
of diabetes?
   Take this quiz to see how your answers match up with those given
by experts. Answer true or false.
   1. People who eat a lot of sugar tend to be heavier than others.
   2. Excess sugar consumption can lead to diabetes.
   3. Sugar plays a role in the development of tooth cavities.
   4. Research has begun to implicate sugar as a risk factor for
certain cancers, particularly cancer of the colon.
   5. Reactive hypoglycemia, a condition characterized by a sharp
drop in blood sugar after meals, affects a larger percentage of the
population than was once believed.
   6. Sugar interferes with the availability of certain vitamins
and minerals to the body.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ANSWERS
   1. False. Overweight people actually eat less sugar than thin
people, according to epidemiological studies. Moreover, the amount
of sugar someone eats is not necessarily a determinant of whether
he will gain weight. Obesity results from a variety of factors,
including life-style, genetics, and overall eating and activity
patterns.
   2. False. Sugar in itself does not contribute to the development
of diabetes. However, it does aggravate the condition once it
exists. People who have diabetes have trouble keeping down their
blood-sugar levels, so eating products that contain a lot of sugar
makes the problem harder to control.
   3. True. It is not possible to say exactly how great sugar's
role is in the development of cavities. The form in which it is
consumed makes a difference. Sugar in sticky substances is more
problematic than sugar in fruit or fruit juices. Other factors,
such as the hardness of the tooth's surface, are also involved. But
the amount of sugar Americans eat contributes to dental cavities.
That's because the bacteria that cause toothe decay feed on sugar.
Sugar also increases the chance that periodontal (gum) disease will
occur. The more sugar a person eats, the more likely it is that his
gums will recede, causing his teeth to loosen.
   4. False. No scientifically based data support the notion that
high levels of sugar consumption increase an individual's risk of
developing any type of cancer.
   5. False. Although many people believe they have reactive
hypoglycemia, relatively few individuals suffer from this condition.
   6. False. Scientists have discovered no convincing evidence that
people who eat large amounts of sugar have trouble metabolizing any
nutrients.
   Note: Taken as a whole, these answers indicate that sugar
appears to cause no direct problems besides playing a role in the
developmnet of tooth decay. But that doesn't mean that a healthy
diet is consistent with the consumption of a lot of sugar-filled
snacks and beverages. Since sugar contributes no nutrients to the
diet, its consumption should be limited to make room for foods with
vitamins, minerals and other essential nutrients.

<HEAD>Fungus May Help Fight Melaleuca Infestation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOXAHATCHEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists may have found a potential
natural ally in their effort to wipe out the imported melaleuca
tree before it takes over the Everglades _ a canker-producing
fungus found in dying trees.
   Widespread use of the organism must wait until scientists are
sure it can be used safely and effectively, said Roger Webb, a tree
pathologist at the University of Florida Department of Forest
Resources.
   Scientists believe as many as 6 billion melaleuca are in South
Florida, covering one-fourth of the Everglades, and they could
cover three-fourths of the Everglades by the end of the decade.
   Webb's work and that of his assistants, along with tests by a
laboratory in England, have tentatively identified the fungus as
Botryosphaeria Ribis, he said.
   The fungus, widespread in tropical and temperate regions, causes
rot in fruit and cankers in the bark of trees ranging from avocado
to elm. Spores are produced in low-lying areas during wet periods
and are spread by rain and wind. Once inside bark, the fungus
spreads through wood, cutting off the flow of nutrients and water;
leaves wilt and die, as do branches above the canker.
   Since 1983, biologists have been killing the melaleuca by
cutting into the bark and squirting herbicides into the wound. They
believe the gashes provided points of entry for the fungus and the
stress from the herbicide made the tree more vulnerable.
   Melaleuca trees were imported from Australia decades ago as a
possible source of lumber, but quickly got out of hand. The smelly
tree causes headaches and other allergic reactions and sucks four
times as much water from the ground as the sawgrass it replaces.
   A task force of federal, state and local scientists recently
began a 25-year eradication program they say may cost up to $10
million.

   Canadian real estate and retailing magnate Robert
Campeau, shoved from the driver's seat of his own company, may be
down but few believe he is out of the picture in efforts to
resurrect debt-ridden Campeau Corp.
   The board of directors dumped Campeau last Friday, declining to
reappoint him as chairman and chief executive officer of the
business he built from a small construction concern in 1949 into
one of Canada's largest companies.
   He remains a member of the board of directors.
   The flamboyant, 66-year-old Campeau bit off more debt than he
could chew when he plunged into the American retail market. He
gobbled up Allied Stores in 1986 for $3.6 billion and Federated
Department Stores, including New York's Bloomingdale's and Rich's
of Atlanta, for $6.6 billion in 1988.
   In January, Federated and Allied filed for bankruptcy protection
and were removed from Campeau's control. Campeau Corp. reported a
1989 loss of $1.74 billion and has debt exceeding $13.3 billion.
   A tough spot, surely. But Campeau has been down before and some
feel he already may be plotting his comeback.
   ``He's done a lot for his country and he may not be finished,''
said George Hitchman, a member of the board and long-time Campeau
loyalist. He said in an interview in the Toronto Star: ``I guess
when you're up, people are with you and when you're down, they kick
you around. That's life.''
   The removal of Campeau does not herald any major shift in
company strategy, said Campeau Corp. spokesman Richard Wertheim.
   ``It appears, at least in the short term, that there aren't any
significant changes expected or planned in the way the company
operates or who is operating it in terms of senior management,''
said Wertheim. ``Of course all this took place a couple of days ago
and they are still discussing plans. The board is going ahead with
finding a permanent chairman and CEO.
   ``The key point is that the changes made Friday night did not
suddenly change the financial picture of the company. Clearly the
restructuring that has been underway will have to proceed. There
will be perhaps some subtle changes, but no significant ones.''
   Campeau lost control of his company when National Bank seized 13
million shares, or about 35 percent, after he defaulted on $150
million in loans. He has been trying to buy back the shares for $80
million, but apparently has not been able to come up with the $40
million down payment.
   That payment was due May 31. The bank announced a one-month
extension, but since then, neither the bank nor Campeau has
commented. He also has shunned requests for interviews before and
since he was booted from the chief executive job.
   Campeau reportedly had been under increasing pressure to leave
because of his hard-line position in renegotiating loans with his
principal lenders, Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. and Olympia and York
Developments. The company spokesman would not comment on the
reasons for Campeau's removal.
   Campeau Corp.'s strategy is to restructure the U.S. operations
under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection process, to sell a
substantial portion of the company's real estate in Canada and to
reach an agreement on restructuring the debt with the principal
lenders.
   The plan seems to be progressing reasonably well, Wertheim said.
Several properties have been sold in recent months, raising about
$82 million. Principal creditors, at least for the moment, seem to
prefer helping Campeau Corp. get back on its feet rather than
seizing assets.
   Campeau also owes $21.5 million to Bank of Montreal and $11.5
million to Bank of Nova Scotia. In addition, he owes $13 million to
Campeau Corp. and already has missed a $1 million payment.

   The Manville trust fund, once viewed as a
watershed in the struggle to compensate tens of thousands of
asbestos victims, now finds itself maligned, nearly out of cash and
verging on extinction.
   Created in 1988 in Manville Corp.'s bankruptcy court
restructuring, the trust has settled close to 24,000 claims for
more than $1 billion from people with lung cancer and other
respiratory diseases.
   But the trust faces 130,000 more claims it can't meet. It has
paid only two thirds of the money for cases settled and is
hemorrhaging cash to defend lawsuits in unresolved cases _ $21
million from January through June. A federal judge has frozen its
spending and ordered its overhaul.
   As judges nationwide craft a solution to the nation's biggest
product liability issue, the Manville trust is blamed for
aggravating the asbestos mess.
   ``It couldn't have been worse,'' Gita Rothschild, an attorney
for several companies that made asbestos, said Wednesday. ``The
idea could have worked. It was mismanaged.''
   Trust officials deny they created its fiscal black hole. They
say it resulted from an unanticipated number of claims,
unexpectedly high settlements and quick resolution of early cases.
   ``The trust didn't write the original script but we have been
charged with carrying out what was ordained,'' Donald M. Blinken,
one of five trustees responsible for the Washington-based
operation, said in an interview.
   ``The trust has had no problem paying its claimants,'' he said.
``The trust simply has never been given enough money.''
   Formation of the trust was supported by a wide majority of
Manville Corp. creditors, plaintiffs lawyers, representatives of
future claimants, co-defendants and the company itself.
   The trust is legally separate from Manville, which sought
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1982 because of lawsuits over
asbestos, an insulation material that causes lung cancer and other
repiratory ailments.
   Insurance payments and Manville cash and securities made the
trust worth about $3 billion. But it now has only $153 million in
cash, well short of what's needed to pay previously settled claims.
A $37.5 million cash infusion from Manville isn't due until August
1991.
   The trust owns about 80 percent of Manville's stock, on which it
relies as a guaranteed source of future income. Even it sold the
stock today, there wouldn't be enough money to pay pending claims,
lawyers assert.
   Though Manville is protected from further lawsuits, publicity
about the trust's problems has helped push down Manville stock to
around $6 a share from over $10 last October.
   Criticism of the trust centers on the size and timing of
payments to victims and on fees received by plaintiffs lawyers. The
bulk of trust money went to settle early cases _ not necessarily
from victims whose illnesses required immediate attention.
   ``The plan didn't say they had to pay an inordinate amount on
the first 15,000 cases,'' said Richard F. Scruggs, a plaintiffs
lawyer in Pascagoula, Miss., handling thousands of cases.
   ``The trust tries to take credit for paying out quickly when
they were paying it out without any regard to the number of future
cases or their severity,'' he said.
   Trust officials blame the reorganization plan, which authorized
settlement on a first-come, first-served basis. The bankruptcy
judge in charge, Burton R. Lifland, refused to limit fees to
plaintiffs lawyers, typically one third of settlements.
   Marianna Smith, the trust's executive director, said the fees
had nothing to do with settlement size _ an average of $43,231 per
claim to date compared with an estimated $25,000 when the trust was
formed.
   But defense lawyers allege their colleagues on the plaintiffs
side inflated settlement requests to make more money. They say no
one forced the trust to pay as much as it did, especially when many
early Manville claimants had received money from other asbestos
defendants.
   ``Is it in the plaintiffs best interest to tell their clients to
take $25,000 when they could bang Manville over the head and take
$50,000?'' Rothschild said.
   ``They dissipated the money in an unbelievably short period of
time paying people who had already been paid with no regard to the
post-1982 and future claimants,'' she said. ``When we started
seeing the payments out in the field it was no surprise they ran
out of money when they did.''
   U.S. Judge Jack B. Weinstein, who ordered the trust's
restructuring and a spending freeze due to expire Sept. 6, said
this week he expects the trust to be combined with funds from
asbestos companies who say they lack money to pay claims. The money
would be paid to victims in a class-action lawsuit.
   In the meantime, Weinstein wants the trust to begin paying
claims based on medical need. An infusion of cash is expected _
possibly as a special dividend on Manville stock or through the
sale of some assets.
   Trust officials said they have proposed resolving asbestos
claims for other companies in addition to Manville to help clear an
asbestos court backlog of 90,000 lawsuits nationwide.

<HEAD>North Carolina Tops Industrial States in Study of Manufacturing
Climates</HEAD>

   Low wages, few unions and modest unemployment
benefits give North Carolina the best manufacturing climate among
the nation's industrial states, says a study of business costs
released today by an accounting firm.
   North Dakota is tops among the 21 less-industrialized states,
according to the survey by Chicago-based Grant Thornton.
   The 11th annual survey showed a striking increase in
manufacturers' concern about the education level of their employees.
   ``Manufacturers are feeling the pinch of educational systems
that produce workers who can neither read, write, nor perform
simple arithmetic,'' the company said. ``Teaching their employees
such basic skills is a substantial expense.''
   Education was second only to wages among the concerns tallied by
the survey, which used 1989 figures. Education ranked eighth in
last year's survey.
   The 16 factors weighed by the study are mostly business costs
that have some degree of changeability, such as wages, taxes,
unemployment benefits, fuel and energy costs, in addition to
education. It does not include such considerations as rail and
highway transportation, water supply, nearness to raw materials and
availability of markets.
   The company said the study could be helpful to manufacturers in
narrowing their choice of where to locate a plant.
   But survey manager Terry Johnson acknowledged that the multitude
of issues not addressed in the survey limits its usefulness in
making any specific decision.
   North Carolina's No. 1 ranking was followed by Vermont, largely
because of the fiscal policies of the state and local governments;
Wisconsin, which had a good performance across the board; and
Mississippi, mostly because of its low wages and low
state-regulated employment costs, such as workers' compensation and
unemployment insurance.
   Michigan had the worst manufacturing climate among
industrialized states, the study said. The state had the highest
average hourly wages, highest percentage of union workers and
ranked high in unemployment and workers' compensation benefits.
   Among the less-industrialized states, North Dakota was followed
by Wyoming, South Dakota and Nebraska. Montana had the worst
manufacturing climate among the less-industrialized states.
   Grant Thornton assembles the factors it wants to consider by
asking manufacturing associations, economic development officials
and state governors to rank a list of issues supplied by the
company.
   Other than education, the factor rankings have changed little
over the years. Following wages and education, the most pressing
areas of concern were workers' compensation and unionization.
   The survey reported the average national manufacturing wage
increased 3.3 percent, from $10 in 1988 to $10.33 an hour in 1989.
Michigan had the highest average manufacturing pay at $13.51 an
hour; Mississippi was lowest at $8.03.
   Wyoming received the highest education ranking among all 50
states; Louisiana was worst.
   The level of education was rated by considering teachers'
salaries, student-teacher ratios, high school graduation rate,
state expenditure per student and per capita higher education
spending compared with per capita income.
   Grant Thornton said labor unions have been losing membership in
each of the six years the company has collected this data. The
percent of manufacturing workers belonging to unions declined from
24.86 percent in 1988 to 23.84 percent in 1989. Among the 50
states, only Florida unions showed an increase, gaining 700 members.
   It was a good year for industrial peace, the company said. If it
weren't for the strike at Boeing Co. from Oct. 4 to Nov. 20, 1989
would have set a record for the least work lost through strikes
during the years surveyed.

<HEAD>SEC May Cut Red Tape for Foreign Banks Selling Securities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is
considering changing its rules to make it easier for foreign banks
and insurance companies to sell their securities here.
   In a unanimous vote Wednesday, the SEC decided to seek public
comment on a plan to cut red tape that requires foreign banks
selling securities here to register as investment companies with
U.S. regulators.
   ``All that this rule does is to say the foreign bank or
insurance company is exempt from the 1940 (Investment Company) Act
_ that it isn't an investment company,'' said Gene A. Gohlke,
associate director of the SEC's Investment Management Division.
   Not only is registration as an investment company costly and
lengthy, ``but then once registered, the '40 Act imposes a lot of
regulatory requirements,'' he said. Such requirments include
periodic reports on the composition of the board of directors, how
the company is financed and what related transactions it is
involved in.
   Those requirements may be ``very difficult _ perhaps impossible
_ for the bank to comply with,'' Gohlke said.
   U.S. banks and insurance companies already are exempted from
registering as investment companies.
   Since 1987, 39 foreign concerns have been granted similar
exemptions by the SEC through a time-consuming process requiring
agency review.
   By issuing an across-the-board rule, Gohlke said, the agency can
save time and personnel.
   ``It takes some time for the staff to work on these and if
they're all pretty much the same, why go through the process of a
one-on-one exemption when we can put a rule out there?'' he said.
   Gohlke said the change, if approved by the four SEC
commissioners after a 60-day comment period, would not exempt
foreign banks from disclosing pertinent facts about their
organization and financing, as required by federal law of all
companies offering securities to the public.

<TEXT>
   Uncertainty over developments in the Middle East
sent stock prices plunging today and nudged the dollar up slightly
against the yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average ended the day at 27,549.76,
down 562.68 points, or 2 percent, from Wednesday, when it jumped
1,439.59 points in its third-largest single-day surge. Volume
totaled 300 million shares.
   Traders attributed Wednesday's gain to optimism over news that
King Hussein of Jordan was traveling to Washington with an
undisclosed message from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. President
Bush and Hussein were to meet later today in Maine.
   ``Yesterday, people became hopeful about the Hussein-Bush
meeting, but today, nothing new came out about it,'' said Hiroshi
Arano, an analyst for Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru Securities.
   Trading was light early today and slowed down as the day wore
on, said Chip Mesics, an equity salesman for Kidder Peabody
International.
   In the currency market, traders also held back pending the
outcome of the Bush-Hussein meeting, said Masato Hayashi, chief
customer dealer at the Bank of Tokyo.
   The dollar closed at 147.90 yen, up 0.05 yen from Wednesday's
147.85-yen finish.
   A common perception of the dollar as a safe haven in times of
crisis has buoyed the currency in recent days. Today's yen selling
also reflected some worries about Japan's dependence on oil
imports, despite the country's large oil reserves, traders said.

<HEAD>Pork, Poultry Prices Expected to Drop Next Year</HEAD>

   A reported boost in livestock production means
shoppers will get some relief in 1991 from record high pork prices
and pay less than this year's reduced prices for poultry, the
Agriculture Department says.
   Beef prices, however, will rise slightly because increased
production will not keep up with population growth, the
department's Economic Research Service says in a 1991 forecast
released Wednesday.
   The forecast says retail pork prices are expected to decline 1
percent to 3 percent in 1991 from this year's record level, and
poultry prices may be down 4 percent to 6 percent. Retail beef
prices may gain only 1 percent to 2 percent.
   The forecast was based on indications that farmers will increase
production because of good prices this year.
   In 1990, the report said, retail pork prices are expected to
climb an average of 12 percent from last year, while beef prices
gain 6 percent.
   Overall 1990 poultry prices, which include broilers and turkeys,
were forecast to drop 2 percent as production rises this year.
   Looking at market prices for 1991, the report said Choice steer
prices may average $75 to $81 per hundredweight next year, about
the same as the $75 to $78 forecast for 1990.
   Hog prices for 1991 were forecast at $49 to $55 per
hundredweight, down from $53 to $56 predicted for 1990. Broiler
prices, at 51 cents to 57 cents in 1991, would be down from 54
cents to 57 cents forecast for 1990.
   Analysts said per capita consumption of red meat and poultry may
rise about six pounds in 1991 from the record level of about 220
pounds annually in 1990 and 1989.
   ``Increased uncertainty about the health of the economy and its
impact on consumer spending for meats are of major concern to the
livestock and poultry sectors as supplies rise and prices continue
high,'' the report said.
   Other factors cited in the analysis included the July 1 cattle
inventory, which was only modestly larger than a year earlier, the
second year of ``relatively static numbers.''
   ``Producers are retaining 4 percent more replacement heifers
this year,'' the report added. ``Even if a larger proportion of
these heifers calve in 1991, the increased calf crop will have
little impact on beef supplies or cattle prices until 1992.''
   Egg production is expected to continue this year's modest gains
in 1991, the report said. Consumption will probably be down about
one egg per person this year and again in 1991. Retail egg prices
are down about 4 percent this year and probably will drop 11
percent to 13 percent in 1991 as production increases.

   Japan has taken a lot of criticism about its
policy banning rice imports, but an Agriculture Department report
says Tokyo's wheat policies aren't anything to brag about, either.
   The United States and many other nation's are pushing for
liberalized trade under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The current Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations is scheduled to
conclude at the end of the year.
   But Japan, like the European Economic Community, continues to
follow price policies ``that are not responsive to free-market
supply-and-demand conditions,'' the report said. ``These policies
discriminate against wheat imports in favor of domestic production
and may also inhibit domestic consumption.''
   The report, included in a recent grain review by the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said Japan's wheat
imports have declined from a peak in 1975 despite continued growth
in population.
   ``This is partially the result of increased local production as
farmers responded to wheat production subsidies initiated in 1974
and doubled in 1977, and the availability of land diverted from
rice production,'' the report said.
   That dramatically increased Japan's wheat area and boosted
production five fold. Moreover, the big subsidies were paid for
mostly by profits from the sale of imported wheat to local flour
millers at fixed prices well in excess of the world price, the
report added.
   During this period, the per capita consumption of wheat leveled
off in the 1970s and declined substantially in the 1980s. The
report said that might have been encouraged by high wheat prices
relative to other commodities.
   ``In contrast, red meat and poultry products have become
relatively less expensive recently, and per capita consumption has
continued to increase,'' the report said.
   If the production subsidies and distribution quota systems were
reduced or eliminated, analysts said Japan's wheat imports might
increase in the range of 700,000 to 1 million metric tons per year
from their current level of slightly more than five million tons.

   Exports of horticultural products are running
well ahead of a year ago, says an Agriculture Department report.
   The value of shipments in the first eight months of the fiscal
year that began last Oct. 1 was more than $2.05 billion, up 5
percent from the same period of 1988-89, the report said Wednesday.
   In May, those exports were valued at $274.5 million, up 9
percent from the same month of the previous year. Exports of tree
nuts, canned vegetables, fresh non-citrus fruit, dried fruit, and
canned and prepared fruit showed the sharpest gains in May.
   The figures did not include horticultural exports to Canada.

<HEAD>Trade Groups Say Wheat Farmers Support Iraq Embargo</HEAD>

   American farmers outraged by President
Carter's 1980 grain embargo against the Soviet Union appear more
willing to do their part in the export ban against Iraq.
   After all, the wheat trade with Iraq had already virtually dried
up this year, officials say. Moreover, farmers are not being
singled out.
   ``I sense fairly widespread support among farmers when the
embargo is across-the-board,'' said Dean Kleckner, president of the
American Farm Bureau in Park Ridge, Ill. ``If we said, as farmers
and ranchers, `We want out,' we would be viewed correctly as very
selfish, and we're not.''
   Until this year, Iraq was the 11th-largest market for U.S. wheat
and the second-largest market for the Midwest's hard red winter
wheat, said Karen Fegley of the National Association of Wheat
Growers in Washington.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated agricultural sales
to Iraq last year at $720 million, out of total farm exports of $40
billion. Sales were even smaller to Kuwait, which Iraq invaded Aug.
2.
   Even before the invasion, Iraq's relationship with U.S. wheat
exporters had been made tenuous because the United States cut by
half to $500 million the credit extended to the Iraqis for
commodities purchases, Fegley said.
   ``They have bought no U.S. wheat this year,'' she said. ``The
immediate impact of the embargo sort of puts the point on the
exclamation mark for us.''
   In endorsing the trade sanctions against Iraq, the nation's
grain growers did an about-face from a decade ago, when they
expressed outrage over Carter's embargo of grain exports to the
Soviet Union after its invasion of Afghanistan.
   After the political fallout, the Carter administration indicated
it would not single out food as an embargo tool, said John Oades of
the U.S. Wheat Associates office in Portland, Ore.
   Previous embargoes ``were not sustained multilaterally,'' Oades
said. ``In other words, the U.S. ended up being isolated from the
market and somebody else ended up taking advantage.''
   But if Western Europe and other countries join in the sanctions,
U.S. wheat growers won't feel like global chumps, he said. ``The
moment somebody breaks stride and begins to ship wheat, growers
would be upset that their resolve is being taken advantage of in
the marketplace,'' Oades said.
   When the United States imposed sanctions on Iran in the late
1970s, American farmers lost a wheat market that had grown
substantially over the previous decade, said Eric Etzel, director
of the Washington Association of Wheat Growers in Ritzville.
   ``The loss of the customer of Iran is something you live with,''
Etzel said. ``I don't think there are any wheat farmers who
supported what was going on with Iran or who support what's going
on with Iraq.''
   Anyhow, said Kleckner, the Iraq embargo merely opens up other
markets for American farmers.
   ``Everything that's produced is sold, if not this year, you do
it at least some point in the future. We've never dumped wheat or
corn or soybeans in the ocean,'' he said.
   ``The trade routes will be different, but trade continues. I
think it is shortsighted to say this will be devastating to
American farmers.''

<HEAD>Presidential Panel Calls for Changes in Drug Testing</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A presidential advisory panel says the Food
and Drug Administration should rely more heavily on its own
advisory panels in approving experimental drugs.
   For patients whose diseases do not respond to available
therapies, ``new treatments on the cutting edge of science may
represent the best standard of care,'' it said.
   The committee, chaired by industrialist Armand Hammer, a
physician by training, concluded that patients are willing to
accept the risks associated with new and untried therapies.
   But it said they can become more widely available only if the
FDA ``can be allowed and is willing to become more flexible in
implementing such innovations.''
   Among the panel's findings:
   _The secretary of health and human services should establish a
permanent policy and oversight committee to monitor the FDA's
regulation and approval of drugs and biologic therapies for human
use.
   _Expedited approval of cancer and AIDS drugs could result if the
FDA relied more frequently on the opinion of qualified experts
serving on agency advisory committees.
   _The FDA should consider modifying its current criteria for
approval of new drug applications. The present standard, proof of
improved survival, might well be changed to include complete or
partial positive responses in patients whose cancers have resisted
all current therapies.
   _Congress should give prompt attention to FDA's inadequate
resources, staff and facilities.
   _The FDA's advisory committee system for human prescription
drugs should be fundamentally restructured with panels permitted to
bypass intermediate staff and report directly to the FDA
commissioner. The panels should have an independent staff and
control their own agendas and priorities.
   The panel also recommended that companies sponsoring
experimental drugs have the option of paying the FDA for outside
review of the applications by qualified and unbiased experts in
order to resolve the FDA's problem of increasing responsibilities
and decreasing staff.
   At least one consumer advocate, himself a frequent critic of FDA
procedures, questioned the wisdom of effectively delegating more
authority to drug companies.
   ``To set up these outside extra-governmenta, psuedo-regulatory
bodies is to ask for trouble,'' said Sidney Wolfe, director of the
Public Citizen Health Research Group. ``Industry, directly or
indirectly, is not capable of regulating itself.''

<HEAD>Is A Penny Even Worth Bending Over To Pick Up?</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Used to be a penny bought a peppermint stick. Or
your sweetheart's thoughts. A penny saved was a penny earned. At
least a penny was worth bending over to pick up.
   Today, economics professor John Palmer says the Canadian penny
is just a pain in the neck.
   ``It's a nuisance,'' declared the University of Western Ontario
professor behind a ``ban the penny'' movement.
   ``It wears out your pockets. We end up storing them in piggy
banks and jars. It takes up a lot of time in checkout lines. They
don't give us any benefits as consumers. There is absolutely
nothing good to say about the penny, except nostalgia. We should
all keep some in our little jewelry boxes for nostalgia.''
   Palmer began a low-key campaign to ban the penny with an article
in an economic newsletter. Newspapers picked up the story and
Palmer started getting attention, mostly positive.
   ``It's a hot discussion and we are getting a fair number of
calls,'' says Mike Francis, spokesman for the Canadian mint.
   But the campaign doesn't seem to have sparked much thinking on
the subject at the Finance Ministry, the mint's boss.
   ``We have done our job by alerting the minister's office that
this topic is becoming warm,'' Francis said. ``Ultimately, it boils
down to a political decision.''
   A Canadian penny costs more to make than it's worth.
   The Canadian cent, unlike its American counterpart, is 98
percent copper, 1.5 percent zinc and 0.5 percent tin. The American
penny is more than 90 percent zinc and coated with copper.
   Mint spokesman Francis says it costs the federal government
between 1.25 and 2 cents to make a penny, depending on fluctuations
in metal prices and the size of the run. The mint struck more than
one billion pennies last year. Yet nobody really likes them.
   Palmer's solution? Just get rid of them. Don't accept them any
more. Round off prices to the nearest nickel, or even the nearest
dime. The British got rid of the farthing and the half-penny
without big problems. The French eliminated the centime. What's the
problem with abolishing the Canadian penny?
   One fear is that merchants will all round prices up rather than
up or down to the nearest 20th of a dollar. Palmer's response: So
what?
   ``Rounding up doesn't matter because we don't want the pennies
anyway,'' says Palmer, who answers his phone, ``Ban the Penny.''
   ``You can't buy anything for a penny,'' he says. ``I haven't
seen a parking meter in years that takes a penny. Just don't take
them. When I'm in a store, if the change involves pennies I just
put them in the charity box at the register, or flip them in the
fountain at the mall.''
   In Canada you can't even take perverse pleasure in clunking down
a sackful of pennies in payment of a particularly distasteful debt.
Under the Currency Act, more than 25 pennies is not legal tender.
Rats!
   Francis points out there are also other solutions, such as
changing the metal content of the penny, or even going to a
two-cent coin.
   The dollar coin, known as the ``loonie,'' was brought in only
after demand grew over a 10-year period.
   ``We don't make anything that nobody wants,'' says Francis. ``We
wouldn't make them if there was no demand. The banks buy money from
us and keep it in inventory. They use that money to supply their
customers, predominately in the retail sector. As long as there is
a demand for any type of coinage, we are obliged to meet that
demand.''
   It would seem the penny is in no immediate danger, despite the
efforts of John Palmer.
   As the Toronto Globe and Mail mused editorially:
   ``You try taking four pennies with you on a shopping trip,
figuring that guards you against receiving pennies in change, but
you inevitably find more pennies in your purse or pocket than when
you started. How does this happen? Do the coins breed in
captivity?''

   Major oil producers on Alaska's North
Slope said they will boost production from existing wells by 50,000
barrels daily by year's end.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins outlined proposals in Washington,
D.C., Wednesday to increase both production and conservation to
replace oil supplies lost when Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   ``. . . Starting immediately we are accelerating well
stimulation programs at Prudhoe Bay,'' said Paul Laird, a spokesman
for BP Exploration in Anchorage.
   Rising oil prices in the wake of the Iraqi invasion also have
made it economically feasible to pump oil faster.
   ``A barrel of oil that comes out of the ground tomorrow is going
to do a whole lot more for us than it would have a few weeks ago,''
said Laird.
   BP and ARCO Alaska, Inc., operate the giant Prudhoe Bay field
for about a dozen companies with a share in it.
   Within a few months, well stimulation is expected to add about
50,000 barrels of oil daily to the 1.6 million currently shipped
from the North Slope. That plus other planned production increases
should boost North Slope output by 200,000 barrels daily by
mid-1991, BP and ARCO said.
   The quickened production will shorten the Prudhoe Bay
reservoir's life only by a fraction, officials said. The field, the
nation's largest, will support oil production ``well into the next
century _ at least another 20 years,'' said Laird.

<HEAD>Sale of Fruit of the Loom Stake Tells Farley's Troubled Story</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farley Inc.'s sale of a 6.1 percent stake in
Fruit of the Loom Inc. indicates just how deeply the debt problems
run in William Farley's industrial empire, experts say.
   ``Farley clearly does not want to part with this Fruit of the
Loom stock and he's selling it, in my opinion, at a low price,''
said Lee Tawes of Oppenheimer Inc. in New York.
   ``It just says Farley is in a very difficult financial position
and having a liquidity problem,'' Tawes said.
   Farley Inc. said Wednesday it had sold 3.75 million shares of
Fruit of the Loom's Class B stock for $43.1 million to Land Free
Investment Ltd., a corporation chartered in the Channel Islands
between Britain and France.
   Class B stock carries five votes per share, as opposed to Class
A stock, which has one vote per share.
   Company officials would not comment on the reasons for the sale.
Analysts speculated Farley needed cash to make a debt payment that
was due Wednesday.
   Farley Inc. said it sold the stake in the Chicago-based
underwear, socks and sweatshirt manufacturer for $11.50 per share,
which Tawes said was ``very cheap.'' Fruit of the Loom closed at
$12.62{ Wednesday on the American Stock Exchange, up $1.12{ from
Tuesday's close.
   The sale still leaves Chairman William Farley in control of 53.6
percent of Fruit of the Loom's shareholder votes, according to a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Farley Inc. and William Farley, the company's majority
stockholder, have sold more than $11 million of Fruit of the Loom's
Class A stock since March, according to SEC filings. But they
previously had sold no Class B stock, of which they owned all 15.2
million shares: 12 million by Farley Inc. and 3.2 million by Farley
personally, according to the company's proxy statement.
   Farley Inc. owned about 20 percent of Fruit of the Loom prior to
the sale.
   The Class B stock automatically converted to Class A stock upon
the sale, the company said in a statement.
   Farley is chairman of both Farley Inc. and Fruit of the Loom,
one of the brightest performers in the stable of manufacturing
companies he assembled during the past 15 years, largely relying on
debt financing.
   Some of Farley Inc.'s financial troubles stem from its
acquisition of the Georgia sheet-and-towel manufacturer West
Point-Pepperell Inc.
   Technically, the $3 billion leveraged buyout was never completed
because Farley was unable to raise enough money to acquire the last
5 percent of Pepperell's stock.
   In March, Farley defaulted on $1.5 billion in debt and
subsequently offered to give up a majority stake in Pepperell if
bondholders would agree to lower yields and deferred payments. The
issue has not been resolved.

   Housing starts continued to plummet in July,
falling 2.6 percent to their lowest level since the last recession,
the government said today. It was their sixth straight monthly
decline.
   The Commerce Department said starts of new homes and apartments
totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.15 million units
after falling 2.2 percent in June.
   The July decline pushed housing starts to their lowest level
since an annual rate of 1.14 million got under way in September
1982 when the economy was about to emerge from the 1981-82
recession.
   The last time starts fell for six straight months was the
June-November period of 1981.
   Most analysts had expected a small increase in starts in July,
noting relatively normal weather, mortgage rates that were falling
into the single digits and falling inventories that could stimulate
renewed building.
   According to surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.,
the cost of fixed-rate 30-year mortgages fell from 10.06 percent at
the beginning of July to 9.98 percent toward month's end. However,
rates had edged back up to 10.08 percent by last Friday.
   Inventories slipped from a 8.2-month supply at the May sales
pace to a 7.5-month backlog in June, helped by an 8.0 percent jump
in new home sales.
   The rate of housing starts in July remained below the 1.38
million homes built in 1989 and the sluggish pace resulted in the
loss of 51,000 construction jobs last month. For the first seven
months of 1990, the building pace was 9.6 percent below the same
period of 1989.
   And few analysts foresee any surge in building for the remainder
of the year, given continued relatively high mortgage rates, a
slowing job market and consumer caution.
   Applications for building permits, often a barometer of future
housing activity, also slumped _ down 2.6 percent to an annual rate
of 1.08 million.
   Construction of single-family units fell 1.4 percent to an
annual rate of 873,000 units in July following a 1.3 percent
decline a month earlier. Multi-family starts were down 6.5 percent
to an annual rate of 275,000 units after a 4.9 percent drop in June.
   All regions except the West participated in the slump. Starts in
the West jumped 8.7 percent to an annual rate of 317,000 units.
   But starts fell in the South, down 6.7 percent to an annual rate
of 498,000 units. They were off 5.5 percent to 225,000 units in the
Midwest and 5.3 percent to 108,000 units in the Northeast.

   Even a little alcohol can hinder pilots' ability
to fly, and federal rules should bar them from taking the controls
until at least 12 hours after their last drink, two doctors
recommended today.
   In a report in the New England Journal of the Medicine, the
doctors, both pilots, recommended sharply tightening Federal
Aviation Administration regulations.
   ``The weight of the evidence suggests that even small amounts of
alcohol can have a profoundly negative effect on flight safety,''
the doctors wrote.
   Under their proposed changes:
   _Pilots would not be allowed to fly if their blood alcohol
levels were more than .01 percent. Current federal rules allow .04
percent. (In most states, the illegal level of alcohol in the blood
for drunken driving is 0.10 percent, but five states _ California,
Colorado, Oregon, Maine and Utah _ have set the level at a a more
stringent 0.08 percent.)
   _They would need to wait at least 12 hours after drinking before
flying. The current ``bottle-to-throttle'' rule is eight hours.
   _Flying would be prohibited within 24 hours of consuming five or
more drinks or when hung over.
   _Pilots would be quizzed about their knowledge of alcohol's
effects when taking licensing exams.
   The rules were proposed by Drs. Jack G. Modell and James M.
Mountz of the University of Michigan.
   They also recommended studying the possibility of equipping
planes with locks that require pilots to pass coordination tests
before they can start their planes. These devices require pilots to
perform a brief task to check their reaction times and short-term
memories, among other things.
   The doctors noted that surveys have shown that between 10
percent and 30 percent of pilots involved in fatal accidents caused
by pilot error have alcohol in their blood.
   They said that pilots may still perform poorly many hours after
heavy drinking, even though alcohol has virtually disappeared from
their blood.
   Closing arguments were scheduled to resume today in the case of
three former Northwest Airlines pilots charged with operating an
aircraft under the influence of alcohol.
   Defense attorneys said Wednesday in U.S. District Court in
Minneapolis that the pilots may have used poor judgment by drinking
the night before a flight, but their flying ability was not
impaired.

   Falling energy prices helped hold down the
overall increase in consumer prices in July, the government said
today in what analysts believe will be the last moderate inflation
report before the Persian Gulf crisis produces higher oil costs.
   The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose 0.4
percent last month despite a 0.7 percent drop in energy costs.
   The overall July gain followed a slightly brisker 0.5 percent
advance in June and a modest 0.2 percent rise in May. It was a bit
larger than the 0.3 percent expected by most economists and was
regarded as a worrisome sign going into August.
   ``It tells us that inflation was well-entrenched going into the
oil shock. While not horrendous, it was very much a part of the
scene,'' said economist Robert Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago.
   The Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has sent oil prices
spiraling since the government surveyed prices for today's report.
   Even without the oil shock, inflation for the first seven months
of the year was running at a 5.8 percent annual rate, compared with
4.6 percent for all of 1989.
   Also today, the Commerce Department said housing starts
continued to plummet in July, falling 2.6 percent to their lowest
level since September 1982 when the economy was about to emerge
from the 1981-82 recession. It was the sixth straight monthly
decline.
   Despite weakness in housing, persistent inflation leaves the
Federal Reserve Board little leeway to stimulate the economy with
lower interest rates, Dederick said.
   Stock and bond prices fell after the economic reports were
released. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks declined
19.31 points to 2,728.96 in the first half hour of trading.
   The Labor Department said the cost of shelter shot up 0.9
percent, the same as in June. That accounted for half the overall
increase in prices. Much of the CPI rise in shelter prices was
attributed to a 5.1 percent increase in the cost of out-of-town
lodging.
   Food and beverage prices were up 0.4 percent, the third
consecutive increase but a far smaller one than June's 0.7 percent
gain.
   The price of fruit and vegetables rose 1.6 percent, reflecting a
32.2 percent jump in the price of bananas and a 17.1 percent gain
in the cost of lettuce.
   Pork prices were down a slight 0.2 percent, the first decline
since September, a period in which they rose 19.1 percent.
   Egg prices dropped 8.2 percent in July. Nonalcoholic beverages
were up 0.9 percent, while fats and oils rose 1.1 percent.
   Transportation costs rose 0.3 percent last month. Gasoline
prices, which had risen 2.5 percent in June, fell 0.3 percent.
   New car prices, reacting to lackluster sales, fell 0.3 percent,
the sixth consecutive decline. But used car prices rose 0.7
percent, the largest gain since January 1989.
   Clothing prices fell 0.2 percent, the third consecutive drop.
Price increases for some fall and winter clothing only partially
offset further discounts on spring and summer clothes.
   Medical care prices continued a long string of stubbornly high
advances. They rose 0.9 percent in July and were 9.2 percent higher
than a year ago.
   The cost of smoking, aside from its health effects, rose steeply
in July, up 2.7 percent after a 2.4 percent jump in June. Tobacco
prices were 10.9 percent higher than a year ago.
   Prices excluding the volatile food and energy categories rose a
brisk 0.6 percent. Economists often take that measure as a better
gauge of underlying inflationary pressures.
   That so-called core rate has stayed high largely because the
weakening economy hasn't yet pushed unemployment up appreciably.
Thus wages, and the cost of services, which make up 55 percent of
the consumer index, have been rising steadily.
   The various changes put the index for all consumer prices at
130.4 in July. That means that a hypothetical selection of goods
that cost $10 in the 1982-84 base period cost $13.04 last month, up
from $12.44 a year earlier.
   Economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University predicted
August prices would be up 0.7 percent overall, because of the
energy rise.
   ``Rarely have changing energy prices moved so rapidly through
the pipeline to the consumer,'' he said. ``Within hours of the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, prices were rising at the corner gasoline
station as suppliers feared that consumers would exhaust available
supplies.''
   Economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch expects prices will
feel the direct effect of the energy shock through November. After
that, the question is whether the oil spiral will trigger an
increase in prices of seemingly unrelated goods and services.
   ``Lingering upward pressure on the core inflation rate could
persist in subsequent months ... but the net effect would be muted
because economic weakness is likely to lead to compensating
downward pressure on labor costs,'' he said.

   American Stores Co. has agreed to sell its
Buttrey Food and Drug Division for $184 million to a group led by
the managers of the chain.
   The sale, expected to be completed within 60 days, will include
$180 million in cash and about $4 million in lease assumptions,
American Stores said Wednesday.
   Buttrey management teamed up with the Los Angeles-based merchant
banking firm Freeman Spogli &amp; Co. to make the purchase. The buyers
are expected to continue to operate the division, now headquartered
in Great Falls, Mont., under the Buttrey name and with few changes.
   The Buttrey chain, which employs about 4,200 people at 44 stores
in Montana, Washington, Wyoming, Idaho and North Dakota, has annual
sales of about $476 million.
   American Stores said in May that Buttrey was among its marginal
performing assets that were being assessed for possible sale.
American Stores said though Buttrey's sales and earnigs were
improving, they were not performing at desired levels.
   Following the Buttrey sale, American Stores will operate 1,857
food and drug stores in 37 states. American Stores, based in Salt
Lake City, reported profits of $118 million on sales of $22 billion
for the fiscal year ended Feb. 2.

<TEXT>
   More crude oil production might numerically
offset most of the oil lost in the embargo of Iraq and Kuwait, but
environmental and political concerns could limit the U.S. supply of
gasoline, industry sources said today.
   World producers probably could increase their crude output by up
to 3.5 million barrels per day by the fourth quarter, said an
executive with a major U.S. oil company who spoke to reporters on
condition that he and his company not be identified.
   Though that comes close to the 4 million barrels lost daily
through the international boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, the
extra crude would not necessarily accommodate U.S. needs, the
executive said.
   ``There are certain crudes and certain products and certain
suppliers you can't turn to,'' he said. Much of the oil would have
to come from Iran and Libya, which domestic companies would not buy.
   In addition, many refineries that could increase output are not
capable of producing unleaded gasoline or other products that meet
U.S. environmental standards, which are stricter than those imposed
by other nations.
   ``The stuff that's idle today does not serve the purposes of the
U.S.,'' said another major oil company executive also speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Three modern refineries have been knocked out of the world
market because they are located in Kuwait, which was invaded by
Iraq on Aug. 2. The Kuwaiti refineries had a rough capacity of
600,000 barrels of refined oil per day, some of which was arriving
in the southern United States through the Gulf of Mexico, the
industry sources said.
   The executives also predicted that OPEC nations will not
immediately increase production until they allow time for oil
inventories to drop.
   One of the executives called the current oil crisis ``a long
term problem.'' He predicted the price of crude will stay high, as
will the price of gasoline in coming months.
   In late morning trading today on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S.
crude, had risen 42 cents per barrel to $26.88 as traders remained
uncertain about the prospects of increased production by members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

   Ames Department Stores Inc. said it will
close its regional accounting office here as part a companywide
plan to consolidate jobs and cut costs.
   The closing of Ames' downtown Syracuse office will put nearly
160 people out of work, company spokesman Bill Roberts said
Wednesday.
   Ames filed for Chapter 11 protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code in April, just two years after acquiring the Zayre discount
store chain.
   Zayre had an accounting operation in Syracuse. Ames decided to
move some of its operations from its headquarters in Rocky Hill,
Conn., to Syracuse. Those responsibilities will now be shifted back
to Rocky Hill, said Roberts.
   Roberts said that probably fewer than 10 jobs would be
transferred to Rocky Hill. Most of the jobs in the accounting
office are clerical.
   Ames plans to close 221 stores nationwide as part of a
consolidation.

   The U.S. dollar rose Thursday in European trading
dominated by anxiety over the Gulf crisis.
   Gold ended the day moderately higher.
   Dealers said while there were no new trends in the market, the
dollar moved higher as world oil prices strengthened.
   ``We're waiting for the next inspiration,'' said the chief
dealer of a U.S. regional bank in London. ``That may be military
rather than economic.''
   Dealers were also watching the meeting between Jordan's King
Hussein and President Bush for signs of any diplomatic breakthrough
in the Gulf. But they are discounting chances for a diplomatic coup
for the Jordanian monarch and are reluctant to bet that lack of
concrete action after the talks with Bush will lead to Gulf warfare.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 147.90 Japanese yen from

<HEAD>GE Aircraft Engines Cutting 1,500 Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EVENDALE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co.'s aircraft engines
division announced Thursday it will eliminate 1,500 jobs in its
U.S. operations by 1992 because of cuts in military defense
spending.
   GE Aircraft Engines, based in this Cincinnati suburb, said 500
people would be laid off by the end of 1990 at its Evendale and
Lynn, Mass., jet engine plants.
   It expects the rest of the reduction to be accomplished by
attrition through the end of 1992 at the two plants, which produce
engines for military and commercial aircraft.
   The reduction will affect mostly salaried employees, but also
will include some hourly production workers, GE Aircraft Engines
spokeswoman Paula Kollstedt said.
   About 47 percent of GE Aircraft Engines' $6.8 billion in revenue
last year came from military contracts. That percentage is expected
to decrease to 35 percent by 1992, the company said.
   GE said its commercial jet engine business has a $20 billion
backlog for delivery during the next several years.
   ``Unfortunately, the increase in GE's commercial engine business
will not be enough to offset predicted cuts in military spending,''
said Brian Rowe, senior vice president of GE Aircraft Engines. ``We
regret that our existing workload is not large enough to support
current employment levels.''
   Rowe said the reduction is necessary to keep his division
competitive as the United States reduces defense spending.
   Ms. Kollstedt said the number of layoffs and attrition losses
could change, depending on the company's continuing review of the
situation.
   ``This is our best estimate at this time,'' she said.
   The Evendale plant is one of the largest employers in the
Cincinnati area, with a workforce of about 18,000 people. GE
Aircraft Engines employs 37,250 worldwide.
   United Auto Workers union Local 647, which represents almost
5,000 production employees at the Evendale plant, said GE informed
the union Thursday morning of the job cutbacks. Charlie Highlander,
vice president of Local 647, declined comment.

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia today called for an
emergency meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to discuss how to deal with the oil market in light of
the Iraq-Kuwait crisis.
   Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said the kingdom, along with
other unidentified members of the cartel, ``have asked for an
immediate OPEC meeting to discuss a unified decision on dealing
with conditions of the market.''
   No date or site for the meeting was announced.
   The minister, in a short official statement, denied the kingdom
had notified any of its customers of any cutbacks in oil supply for
September.
   Earlier in the day, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said Saudi
Arabia had notified U.S., European and Japanese oil companies of a
15 percent to 20 percent cutback in its oil supply for the month of
September.
   The Japanese officials said no reason was given for the reported
planned cutbacks, which followed reports that the Saudis would
boost daily output from 5.4 million barrels to more than 7 million
barrels to offset the loss of Iraqi oil being blocked by a
worldwide embargo. When Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 it increased
its share of the world's oil reserves to 20 percent.
   At the most recent OPEC meeting, which concluded in Geneva,
Switzerland, on July 27, the 13 OPEC ministers raised the target
price of oil by $3 a barrel to $21 a barrel. They also agreed not
to exceed the production ceiling of 22.5 million barrels a day
until the end of the year.
   Earlier this year, the price declined to the low $16 range
partly because crude output by OPEC and other producers was
outpacing world demand.
   Prices began rising earlier this summer after the cartel reached
an agreement to restrain production. Prices shot sharply higher
after the invasion of Kuwait on speculation that Iraq might attack
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter.
   At the OPEC meeting in July, Iraq accused Kuwait and the United
Arab Emirates of overproducing oil and thus driving down prices.
Iraq, which relies heavily on oil sales to keep its economy afloat,
used the dispute over oil and territory to justify its invasion of
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Takahiro Nakamae of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry's Petroleum Planning Department said earlier today that
even if the report of the planned Saudi oil cutback for September
is confirmed, it will have ``little effect on Japan's overall oil
supply.''
   Japan, he noted, has 142 days worth of oil in reserve.
   Japan has agreed to participate in a full trade embargo on Iraq
and Kuwait, which were supplying 420,000 barrels a day, or 11
percent of Japan's oil imports. Japan is dependent on the Middle
East for nearly 70 percent of its oil, virtually all of which is
imported.
   But Nakamae said Japan can offset the Iraqi and Kuwait oil and
the reported planned cutback by the Saudis by importing more oil
from other sources.

   Stock prices dropped sharply today in moderate
trading amid signs that inflation is picking up and tension in the
Middle East may be rising.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was down 39.61
points to 2,708.66 as of 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancing
ones by more than a 3 to 1 margin on the New York Stock Exchange,
with 344 up, 1,145 down and 454 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 96.64 million
shares as of 2 p.m. EDT.
   The Labor Department said today that consumer prices, excluding
the volatile food and energy sector, rose 0.6 percent last month.
Overall prices rose 0.4 percent, higher than the 0.3 percent most
economists expected.
   The department pointed out that the data was collected before
the start of the Mideast crisis, which has sent oil prices surging.
   The report also caused bond prices to fall sharply, providing
further weakness for stocks.
   Also today, the Commerce Department said housing starts
continued to plummet in July, falling 2.6 percent to their lowest
level since September 1982.
   Despite the weakness in housing, economists said the bad news on
inflation gave the Federal Reserve little room to stimulate the
economy by lowering interest rates.
   Meanwhile, in a statement read by an Iraqi television announcer,
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said President Bush has lied to the
American people about the Middle East situation, and warned there
would be American deaths in the region if the United States
continues to intervene.
   Concern about the Mideast sent oil prices climbing.
   The U.S. stock markets received little help from abroad today.
Stock prices fell in Japan, with the key index on the Tokyo
exchange closing 2 percent lower. Prices also closed lower in
London.

   A Singapore aircraft maintenance company
that does work for the U.S. Navy announced plans Thursday to open
its first American plant.
   State and local officials joined executives of Singapore
Aerospace in announcing the company's $10 million project in
Mobile. The factory will employ up to 400 people next year.
   The operation, known as Mobile Aerospace Engineering, will use a
130,000-square-foot hangar to maintain and repair commercial planes
from companies around the world.
   Singapore Aerospace's clients for engineering and maintenance
services include the Republic of Singapore Air Force and companies
in Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan, Nigeria, Oman, Kuwait, the United
States and Europe. The U.S. Navy has used Singapore Aerospace to
handle its fleet of C-130 aircraft for 10 years.
   The firm recently received a contract to perform extensive
modifications on the Boeing 747, officials said.

   Share prices fell Thursday on the London Stock

   Throughout most of the session, shares drifted without much
investor interest in the slow summer season.
   In the current climate of confusion in world equity markets,

reinvest in the market.
   Also, developments from the Gulf _ including remarks from Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein and news that Britons and Americans held

<TEXT>
   Empire Federal Savings of America has sold
its $900 million auto loan portfolio to a General Electric
subsidiary as part of the federal government's restructuring of the
seized thrift.
   The purchase is GE Capital Auto Financial Services' first major
push into the business of holding and servicing auto loans, said
Keith Helming, manager of business analysis for the GE Capital
unit. GE Capital already is involved in other auto-related
businesses, such as automobile leasing.
   Empire of America was seized by savings and loan regulators in
January as part of the nationwide S&amp;L bailout. Regulators have said
they plan to sell the Buffalo-based thrift's major assets
separately, and hope to complete the process by the end of
September.
   GE plans to buy between $200 million and $400 million worth of
auto loans each year to maintain the size of the Empire portfolio
and eventually make it grow, Helming said.
   He said the company believes this is a good time to enter the
auto loan market because many banks are selling assets and
servicing rights, he said. Some banks have found that the auto loan
business has not met their profit expectations, while others have
been forced to sell auto loan assets in order to raise money to
meet higher federal capital guidelines.
   The purchase includes Empire's auto loan servicing facility in
Amherst, which employs 100 people. Helming said those employees
would be retained, and the facility eventually will be expanded as
the auto loan business grows.

<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. had a 5 percent
drop in net earnings in the third quarter, while earnings per share
dipped from 79 cents to 73 cents, the giant electronics company
reported Thursday.
   In the quarter ending July 31, the company reported net earnings
of $178 million compared to $187 million in the 1989 period.
   Revenues increased 8 percent in the quarter, to $3.2 billion
from $3 billion in the 1989 period.
   ``We're seeing a slowdown in a number of our businesses,
including test and measurement, medical electronics, PCs and
workstations,'' said John Young, the company's president and chief
executive officer.
   Orders for the third quarter totaled $3.3 billion, an increase
of 9 percent from last year's third quarter. However, the figure
was down from 16 percent in the second quarter and 17 percent in
the first.
   A company statement also pointed out that the effective tax rate
for the third quarter of fiscal 1990 was higher than for 1989's
third quarter, when an adjustment to the effective tax rate raised
earnings by 5 cents a share.
   The company said the earnings report reflects two months of
results from Apollo Computer Inc. in the 1989 third quarter and
three months during the same period of 1990. H-P purchased Apollo
Computer Inc. in May 1989.
   For the first nine months of the fiscal year, H-P had net
earnings of $537 million, an 8 percent drop from $583 million in
the 1989 period.
   Net revenues for the nine-month period were $9.65 billion, up 13
percent from $8.52 billion in 1989.

   Domestic automakers were scheduled to produce
165,268 cars and light trucks this week, down from last week's
185,114, Ward's Automotive Reports said Thursday.
   This week's production is lower than the same week a year ago,
in which 200,779 cars and light trucks were produced, the trade
journal said.
   The reduction stemmed mainly from the effects of a six-day
United Auto Workers strike at a parts plant that shut down a
half-dozen assembly plants.
   U.S. automakers were scheduled to make 109,273 cars this week,
compared with 119,087 a week ago and 125,544 in the same week in
1989.
   Light truck production for the week was scheduled at 55,995,
compared with last week's 66,027 and last year's 75,235.
   Canadian automakers were to build 15,560 cars this week, up from
13,311 a week ago and down from last year's 17,656.
   Canadian light truck production was scheduled at 14,215,

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed narrowly
mixed in lackluster trading Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade
as Persian Gulf-related buying offset a persistently bearish tone
in the markets.
   A new round of warlike rhetoric from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
sent the stock market plunging and triggered sharp increases in
crude oil and gold futures. Those events reignited inflation fears,
which lent support to the crop markets, analysts said.
   Corn and soybean futures also were supported by talk of a
possibility of frost in the northern Corn Belt Monday night,
although analysts said the chances for frost in August were
extremely slight.
   Selling pressure stemmed in part from a National Weather Service
forecast predicting normal temperatures and rainfall in the Midwest
during the latter half of next week. Those conditions would benefit
the corn and soybean crops in the region.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent lower to 2{ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.84{ a bushel;
corn futures were 2{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with September

   Assets of the nation's 525 money market mutual
funds rose $2.38 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to a new record of $404.48 billion in the seven-day
period ended Wednesday, followed a revised $6.18 billion increase
in the funds' assets the previous week, according to the
Washington-based mutual fund trade group.
   The previous week's record high total was revised to $402.09
billion.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 252 general purpose funds rose $469.9 million to $140.04
billion, assets of 104 broker-dealer funds increased $1.09 billion
to $163.32 billion, and assets of 169 institutional funds rose
$829.3 million to $101.11 billion.
   ``Despite a slight easing of yields offered by money market
funds, the events in the Persian Gulf have enhanced their
attraction as safe and liquid investment vehicles,'' said Jacob
Dreyer, vice president and chief economist of the institute.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds was
7.50 percent in the week ended Tuesday, unchanged from the previous
week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.54 percent from 7.58 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
45 days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
6.08 percent as of Wednesday from 6.10 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, fell to 5.03 percent from 5.04 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.73
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.75 the
previous week. Yields were 7.88 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
7.90 percent; 7.94 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.96 percent;
and 8.05 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.06 percent.

<HEAD>Analysts: Merger Rejection Shows Feds Wants Stronger Capital
Reserves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve's rejection of the merger
of Bank of New York and a Connecticut bank holding company may be a
signal that banks should build strong capital reserves, analysts
said Thursday.
   The central bank rarely rejects a bank merger. However, late
Wednesday it announced it had denied the application from Bank of
New York to acquire Northeast Bancorp Inc., which owns the Union
Trust Co. of Stamford, Conn.
   ``I don't think there's any question that regulators are sending
a very loud and clear message to the banking community. ... Capital
is king,'' said James J. McDermott Jr., an analyst with Keefe
Bruyette and Woods.
   Capital represents stockholders' investment in a bank and acts
as a cushion between losses and the government's deposit insurance
fund.
   The Fed's action comes a month after Senate testimony from
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, who said strong capital
requirements are the best means of ensuring stability in the
banking system.
   Bank of New York and Northeast first discussed a merger seven
years ago. Bank of New York, with $46.4 billion in assets at the
end of last year, was the nation's eighth largest bank, according
to Sheshunoff Information Services of Austin, Texas. Union Trust,
with $3.5 billion in assets, was the third largest in Connecticut.
   But the merger agreement, reached in 1986, turned into a bitter
dispute over what constituted a fair price for New Haven,
Conn.-based Northeast. Northeast had placed its takeover value at
about $500 million. Bank of New York, which had concerns about the
value of Northeast's loans, valued the company at $195.6 million.
   The disagreement led some analysts to speculate that the New
York bank wanted to back out of the deal. It also led Northeast to
file a breach-of-contract lawsuit in May, seeking $350 million in
damages.
   In its order denying the merger, the Fed noted ``capital
adequacy is an especially important factor in the analysis of
banking holding company expansion proposals.'' It said capital of
the combined banks ``would not be substantially above the board's
minimum capital levels.''
   Another factor in the rejection, McDermott said, likely was
weakening commercial real estate values in the Northeast, which are
cutting into bank profits.
   ``Combinations in the Northeast at this point in time are not
being looked at favorably given the current economic outlook,'' he
said.
   Northeast Chairman Frank J. Kugler Jr. said he was ``deeply
disappointed'' by the Fed's denial.
   ``Northeast has worked diligently and in good faith to attempt
to consummate this transaction for the benefit of its
shareholders,'' he said in a statement.
   He blamed the denial on Bank of New York's acquisition of Irving
Bank Corp., saying that Bank of New York's capital position
``appears to have been substantially and adversely impacted'' by
that deal.
   Kugler also said Northeast is considering amending its $350
million breach-of-contract lawsuit to include additional complaints.
   Bank of New York issued a brief statement saying that ``in view
of (the Fed's) decision, the acquisition cannot proceed.''

<HEAD>NY Fed Temporarily Relocates Money Transfer System Due to Power
Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York temporarily
moved its ``fedwire'' electronic funds transfer system out of New
York on Thursday because of a power problem, averting what could
have been an unexpected bank holiday in the nation's financial
center.
   The fedwire is the central bank's funds and securities transfer
service, the principal means of transferring money between banks.
The New York Fed's fedwire branch is the nation's busiest,
shuttling $900 billion worth of securities and funds among banks
daily.
   Peter Bakstansky, a vice president of the New York Fed, said the
power problem was an indirect result of a local blackout on Monday,
which cut electricity to the Fed office and many other buildings in
the neighboring Wall Street area of southern Manhattan.
   The New York Fed's contingency system of diesel-powered
generators had been operating the fedwire since the blackout.
   But Bakstansky said one of the generators began to falter
Thursday and Fed officials decided to take the precautionary step
of relocating the entire operation to an emergency backup site in
Pearl River, N.Y., a northern suburb. That caused a slight delay in
fedwire transactions, he said.
   ``It was a matter of reconnecting the banks to a new site,'' he
said. ``We consulted with banks all through the morning, and by 11
a.m. we were on line with securities transfers. By 11:15 we were on
line with funds transfers.''
   He said if the New York Fed hadn't opened the fedwire, banks in
the area couldn't have completed ordinary transfers of money and
likely would have been forced to severely curtail operations or
perhaps close for the day.
   The Pearl River location was an emergency site developed by the
New York Fed in 1987 in case such a power problem arose, Bakstansky
said.
   It was unclear how soon the operation would be able to return to
Manhattan, he said.

<HEAD>Oil, Gold Prices Surge on Renewed Mideast Tensions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices surged Thursday on New York's Commodity
Exchange as a flurry of developments in the Persian Gulf triggered
a rally in crude oil prices, a dive in the stock market and a
renewal of inflation fears.
   On other commodity markets, livestock and meat futures were
mixed, and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $6.20 to $6.90 higher with the contract for
spot delivery up $6.60 at $409.20 a troy ounce; silver was 9.9
cents to 10 cents higher with the spot August contract at $5.168 a
troy ounce.
   The perceived safety of precious metals lured investors from the
stock market as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein unleased a new round
of rhetoric.
   Hussein said he was praying for a peaceful resolution to the
Persian Gulf crisis but that if a military confrontation erupts, it
could result in ``thousands of Americans wrapped in sad coffins.''
   And in a development U.S. officials described as unjustified and
Britain called ``grave and sinister,'' Iraqi military authorities
in Kuwait instructed all Americans and Britons to assemble at two
hotels in the emirate.
   Pentagon sources disclosed plans to send 45,000 Marines to the
reinforce thousands of U.S. troops there.
   Meanwhile, Jordan's King Hussein denied reports he had carried a
message from Iraq's Hussein to President Bush, diminishing hopes
for a quick, peaceful resolution to the U.S.-Iraqi showdown.
   The heightened tensions contributed to a 66-point drop in the
Dow Jones industrial average and a sharp rise in oil prices on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, reflecting dimming prospects for a
resumption of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil exports any time soon.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 92 cents
higher with September at $27.36 a barrel; heating oil was 2 cents
to 2.62 cents higher with September at 75.47 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 1.8 cents to 3.41 cents higher with September
at 87.46 cents a gallon.
   The rise in oil prices fed inflation fears, which in turn
supported gold.
   The Middle East crisis has given gold a shot in the arm but
analyst Fred Demler of PaineWebber Inc. in New York said he was
bullish on gold, based on the market's supply-and-demand factors,
even before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   ``Once the Mideast situation blows over, we think there will be
a setback (in gold prices), but then we think they'll strengthen
again based on other fundamentals,'' he said.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange as cattle traders evened up their positions
ahead of Friday's monthly cattle-on-feed report from the
Agriculture Department.
   The report is expected to show active placements of cattle onto
feedlots and active marketings off of feedlots last month.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent lower to .12 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in August at 78.47 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .05 cent lower to .20 cent higher with August at 89.97
cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent lower to .70 cent higher
with August at 57.57 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 2
cents lower to .05 cent higher with August at 48.95 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures ended narrowly mixed in lackluster
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade as buying prompted by Middle
East tensions offset selling pressure stemming in part from
forecasts for good growing weather in the Midwest during the latter
half of next week.
   Wheat futures settled { cent lower to } cent higher with
September at $2.84{ a bushel; corn futures were 2{ cents lower to
1{ cents higher with September at $2.49 a bushel; oats were 1 cent
to 1{ cents higher with September at $1.18 a bushel; soybeans were
3 cents lower to 5 cents higher with August at $6.12{ a bushel.

<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Aug. 6, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,289.2 billion from $3,278.1 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,078.4 billion from $4,068.6 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $813.0 billion from $809.2 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 3.7 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 was 1.5 percent, which is within the
Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed has not set a
target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,277.4 billion, a 1.0
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,067.0 billion, down 0.1 percent, while M1
rose 1.8 percent to an average of $808.5 billion.
   In other reports:
   _ The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $178 million,
compared with a rise of $1.178 billion a week earlier.
   _ The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $585 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$455 million the previous week.
   _ The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged a revised
$270 million in the two weeks ended Aug. 8, down from a revised
$320 million in the previous two-week period.
   _ The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $309.8 billion in the two-week period ended
Aug. 8, down from $310.8 billion two weeks earlier.

   Stock prices dropped sharply Thursday in
moderate trading amid signs of rising inflation and increasing
tension in the Middle East.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 66.83 to
2,681.44. It was the lowest close of the market's key indicator
since the Mideast crisis began.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 4 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
330 up, 1,300 down and 386 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 138.85 million
shares, up from 135.21 million in Wednesday's session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 169.86 million shares.
   The Dow dropped about 20 points after the Labor Department
reported that consumer prices, excluding the volatile food and
energy sector, rose 0.6 percent last month. Overall prices rose 0.4
percent, higher than the 0.3 percent most economists expected.
   The department pointed out that the data was collected before
the start of the Mideast crisis, which has sent oil prices surging.
   The report also caused bond prices to fall sharply, providing
further weakness for stocks.
   Also, the Commerce Department said housing starts fell 2.6
percent in July to their lowest level since September 1982.
   Despite the weakness in housing, economists said the bad news on
inflation gave the Federal Reserve little room to stimulate the
economy by lowering interest rates.
   Meanwhile, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein charged that President
Bush has lied to the American people about the Middle East
situation, and warned there would be American deaths in the region
if the United States continues to intervene.
   Also, President Bush met with Jordan's King Hussein, but
afterward the king said he had not made up his mind about complying
with a United Nations embargo of Iraq. In addition, the king said
he did not carry a letter from the Iraqi leader to Bush, as was
previously reported.
   ``The market was expecting something positive from the
meeting,'' said Yuichi Abe, a vice president in the New York office
of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
   Concern about the Mideast sent oil prices climbing, furthering
inflationary pressures.
   The U.S. stock markets received little help from abroad. Stock
prices fell in Japan, with the key index on the Tokyo exchange
closing 2 percent lower. Prices also closed lower in London.
   Prices of U.S. consumer stocks took a particular beating, with
Philip Morris down 2 to 45\, McDonald's off 1&lsqb; to 29 and Procter &amp;
Gamble falling 2~ to 80|.
   Among most-active blue-chip stocks, IBM lost 1\ to 103}, General
Electric fell 1&rsqb; to 64~, Boeing lost 1} to 50| and American Express
dropped 1\ to 25&rsqb;.
   Ohio Edison was the most-active NYSE issue, falling 2{ to 17&rsqb; as
2.19 million shares changed hands. Ohio regulators gave the utility
a lower rate increase than requested, and analysts speculated its
dividend may be cut.
   About 20 minutes before the close of trading, the Dow's drop set
off a market ``circuit breaker'' designed to prevent a freefall in
prices. The mechanism, triggered by a 50-point Dow decline, bars
sales connected to index-futures arbitrage until the prices of the
stocks involved rise.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $65.018 billion, or 2.01
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
3.81 to 182.73.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 8.96 to 392.42, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index dropped 7.67 to 332.39.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
9.18 to 402.27. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index lost 3.81 to 336.83.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls to All-Time Low Against Mark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar tumbled to an all-time low against
the German mark during domestic trading as heightened Persian Gulf
tensions and further signs of U.S. economic weakness spurred a wave
of selling.
   Gold prices benefited from the Middle East instability, rising
$6.60 an ounce.
   The dollar was quoted at 1.5525 marks in late New York trading,
down from 1.566 marks late Wednesday and from 1.5645 marks Tuesday,
the previous low in the modern mark's 42-year history.
   The dollar also was sharply lower against the Swiss franc and
British pound.
   ``As long as the U.S. is involved in this crisis I think we're
going to find that the dollar is not the safe haven it once was
during international crises,'' said Scott Horwitz, a vice president
for foreign exchange trading with Bank of Boston.
   After rising in overseas trading, traders sold heavily in New
York after a fiery speech by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that
offered little hope of a quick end to the standoff over the
invasion of Kuwait.
   That normally would give the dollar a boost, but the weak state
of the U.S. economy has overwhelmed the currency's traditional
attractiveness as a haven during times of international turmoil.
   A government report that consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in
July added to pessimism about the economy's course and contributed
to the sell-off.
   ``Even though the tension may have escalated in the Gulf, the
market is focusing on two trajectories in the U.S. economy _ weaker
growth and higher inflation,'' said Marc Chandler, a currency
analyst with MMS International in Chicago.
   Weakness in the U.S. economy eventually could force the Federal
Reserve to reduce interest rates to avoid a recession just as West
Germany, Japan and other nations boost their rates to curb
inflation.
   The net effect has been to make the dollar less attractive to
foreign investors. But because of inflationary higher oil prices, a
Fed interest rate drop now is considered highly unlikely for the
present.
   The rise in oil prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 was not
reflected in the new inflation data.
   In New York, the dollar fell to 147.25 Japanese yen from 147.65
yen late Wednesday. Earlier in Tokyo, it rose to 147.90 Japanese
yen from 147.15 yen at Wednesday's close. In London, the dollar was
quoted was quoted at 147.62 yen.
   The dollar also fell worldwide against the British pound. The
pound rose to $1.9095 in New York from $1.9090 late Wednesday. In
London, sterling fell to $1.8985 from $1.9045 late Wednesday.
   Other dollar rates as of 4 p.m. in New York, compared with late
rates Wednesday, included: 1.2915 Swiss francs, down from 1.30735;
5.2220 French francs, down from 5.2570; 1,143.25 Italien lira, down
from 1,149.75; and 1.14815 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14345.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Wednesday
included: 1.5630 German marks, up from 1.5605; 1.3025 Swiss francs,
up from 1.3005; 5.2495 French francs, up from 5.2365; 1.7610 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.7579; 1,149.75 Italian lire, up from 1,145.75,
and 1.1477 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1435.
   Gold prices gained in response to apparently rising tensions in
the Persian Gulf, including Saddam's speech and the meeting between
President Bush and Jordan's King Hussein. Gold is viewed as an
attractive investment that can withstand times of crisis.
   Gold for current delivery rose $6.60 to $409.20 a troy ounce on
the Commodity Exchange in New York. Republic National Bank quoted a
bid for a troy ounce of gold at $409 as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $6.60
from Wednesday's late bid.
   Earlier, gold rose to $403.50 a troy ounce in London from
$402.25 late Tuesday and to $401.25 an ounce in Zurich from $398.75
late Wednesday. In Hong Kong, gold rose 95 cents to $402.45 an
ounce.
   On the Comex, silver for current delivery rose 10 cents a troy
ounce to $5.168. Silver bullion rose to $5.13 an ounce in London
from $5.12 late Tuesday.

   Inc. magazine plans to begin publishing a
Russian-language edition in mid-1991, the owner of the magazine
which is designed to help people build small companies said
Wednesday.
   Bernard Goldhirsh, Inc.'s founder and chairman of the privately
held company that owns it, said the Russian edition would be
published in a joint venture with International Computer Exchange,
a Soviet publishing company.
   He said 100,000 copies would be distributed free of charge each
month once the magazine begins publishing next year. Eventually, he
said he hoped to convert those who get the magazine into paying
subscribers.
   ``There are already a lot of people running small businesses
there. This will offer them some guidance,'' Goldhirsh said in a
telephone interview.
   Goldhirsh founded Inc. 11 years ago and the magazine has a
monthly circulation of 640,000.
   He said 80 percent of the material in the Russian version of
Inc. would be translations of material from the U.S. magazine while
20 percent would be original material produced in the Soviet Union.
   Goldhirsh said his company, which is based in Boston, would
share advertising revenue with its Soviet partner. Ad space would
be sold to companies throughout the world interested in the Soviet
market, he said.

<HEAD>Sun-IBM in Patent Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sun Microsystems has signed an
agreement with computer giant IBM that allows each company to use
the other's patents, the companies announced Wednesday.
   Each company granted the other a ``world-wide, non-exclusive
license'' covering patents with an effective filing date before
July 1, 1995, the announcement said.
   Sun will benefit from the research and development of
International Business Machine Corp., which has 10,000 patents in
the United States alone, said Michael Morris, Sun's chief counsel.
   Because of the size of the IBM patent portfolio compared to
Sun's, Sun will pay IBM a net royalty payment that was not
disclosed, the announcement continued. It said the payments will be
made in five annual installments.
   Bob Herwick, an analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco,
called the agreement ``very interesting.''
   He said IBM might use the deal to bolster Sun, a workstation
maker, against other rivals.
   ``IBM tends to divide the world in three parts: IBM, Sun and
`others,' '' he said.
   ``I don't think IBM is interested in the royalties,'' he said.

<HEAD>Two Officials Ousted from Farah's Board of Directors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders in the 70-year-old apparel
manufacturer Farah Inc. have voted to remove two officials from the
board of directors, including the son of the company's founder.
   William F. Farah and Charles Wood were removed following a
debate this year over who should control the company, Farah Inc.
said Thursday.
   Last week, about 50 shareholders voted on the issue during a
special meeting held at Farah's request. Other votes were mailed in.
   Votes were counted by Dallas-based Ameritrust Texas N.A., and
results were given to the company Thursday.
   Farah, the company's largest shareholder, demanded that the six
board members step down and that he be placed in charge of the
company. Farah has blamed the board of directors for the company's
recent losses, including $11.6 million last year.
   But board members say Farah, director and consultant for Farah
Inc., has interfered with daily management of the company, causing
$46.7 million in losses over five years.
   The power struggle intensified this year when board members told
Farah he was not sticking to a $365,000 consulting agreement. Farah
responded with a lawsuit and the proxy battle.
   Company Chairman Thomas Wyman said the board tried to avoid the
meeting, but added, ``Mr. Farah is a determined person with a lot
of convictions.''
   The results presented Thursday indicate more than 75 percent of
all shares represented and more than 55 percent of the outstanding
shares were voted in favor of removing Farah and Wood.
   ``We deeply regret that sincere efforts to dissuade Mr. Farah
from this proxy contest were not successful,'' Wyman said Thursday
in a prepared statement. ``Now that this special shareholders'
meeting is behind us, management and the board can ... concentrate
on returning the company to profitability.''
   The meeting was in the same week that Farah filed for bankruptcy
protection for his real estate investment business and an apartment
complex he owns. The drop in the value of Farah Inc. stock and
changes in tax laws led Farah to file the Chapter 11 petition in El
Paso earlier this month, observers say.
   The petition shows Farah's debts to his largest unsecured
creditors total $2.3 million.

   Hewlett-Packard Co. will switch the
headquarters of its Personal Computer Group from California to
Grenoble, France, the company announced Thursday.
   The company also said that Jacques Clay, general manager of its
Grenoble Personal Computer Division, has been named general manager
of the group.
   It has not been determined whether the 650 workers at the
division's current headquarters in Sunnyvale will remain there,
said spokeswoman Irene Economou.
   ``He (Clay) will be looking at the organization to determine
where the staff should be logically located,'' she said.
   Lewis Platt, head of the company's Computer Products Sector,
said the move was prompted by the important of Hewlett-Packard's
international sales.
   ``Currently, international markets represent more than half of
HP's sales of PCs and terminals and have great potential for
expansion,'' he said. ``As such, it is quite opportune to have an
international PCG headquarters.''
   Clay, 47, who joined Hewlett-Packard in 1973, replaces Robert
Puette, who recently left the company.
   Hewlett-Packard has two plants in the Grenoble region that
produce personal computers, terminals and cardiology equipment. It
has about 4,000 workers in France.
   Hewlett-Packard, which has 92,000 employees worldwide, had
revenues of $11.9 billion in its 1989 fiscal year.

<HEAD>Farm Credit System's Net Income Slips in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Farm Credit System said Thursday its net
income dropped slightly in the second quarter as an increase in net
interest income failed to offset shrinkage in the system's negative
provision for loan losses.
   The system said it earned $171 million in the April through June
period, compared with $180 million during the same period last year.
   The Farm Credit System is a nationwide network of
federally-chartered agricultural lending institutions that are
cooperatively owned by their borrowers. The system is the biggest
lender to the nation's farms.
   The system said its net interest income rose to $295 million in
the second quarter from $256 million for the same period last year.
However, the negative provision for loan losses fell to $18 million
from $80 million in last year's second quarter.
   Also, the system said it expects to take a $40 million charge in
the third quarter as the Farm Credit Bank of Spokane, Wash.,
repurchases some of its high-cost debt.
   In the first six months of the year, the system's net income
rose to $362 million from $356 million for the first half of 1989.
Net interest income in the first six months of 1990 was $616
million, compared with $496 million for the same period last year.

<HEAD>Big Drop on Fear of Saddam, Higher Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bad inflation news from Washington and war words
from Iraq's Saddam Hussein combined to wallop the bond market
Thursday, jacking up interest rates and depressing prices sharply
in nervous trading.
   The Treasury's key 30-year bond fell 1 23-32 points, or $17.19
per $1,000 in face amount. The bond's yield jumped to 8.92 percent
from 8.76 percent late Wednesday. It was the highest yield since it
flirted with 9 percent in early May.
   Economists said the bond market's deterioration began early in
the day when the Labor Department said the consumer price index for
July rose 0.4 percent, considered an unexpectedly high increase.
   That was the last measurement of inflation prior to the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, which has sent oil prices sharply
higher. Strategists concluded the inflation rate will likely be
even worse than previously thought when the effect of the oil price
jump is calculated for August and beyond.
   ``What you're looking at here are straight worries about
inflation,'' said Lincoln Anderson, an economist for Bear Stearns &amp;
Co. ``The CPI report was not a good one.''
   Bondholders sell on bad inflation news, which erodes the value
of fixed-income investments and lessens the likelihood that the
Federal Reserve will ease interest rates to stimulate economic
growth.
   There had been widespread predictions of a Fed ease because of
evidence the economy is so weak, which tends to make bonds a more
valuable investment. But now many bond strategists fear the Fed
won't change credit policy for awhile.
   The fear was aggravated Thursday by the Iraqi leader's vitriolic
rhetoric against President Bush and the United States, in which he
threatened to kill American soldiers and called Bush a liar.
   That suggested the Persian Gulf crisis could worsen and drive
oil prices higher still, thereby making the inflation outlook even
more grim.
   ``All the uncertainty surrounding Iraq was a basic reason for
what happened in the bond market,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief
market analyst for Chase Manhattan Bank in New York.
   Kathleen Camilli, chief economist for Maria Ramirez Capital
Consultants Inc., said she believed the Gulf conflict would remain
an underlying influence on bond prices indefinitely.
   ``The bottom line is that to the extent we still have
uncertainty in the Middle East, that will drive the bond market,''
she said. ``The economic numbers will take a back seat.''
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell { point to } point, intermediate maturities fell 1
point to 1\ points and long-term issues fell about 1} points, the
Telerate Inc. financial information service.
   The movement of a point equals a $10 change in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, dropped 8.43 to 1,145.50.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.73 percent as the
discount rose 4 basis points to 7.49 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 7.85 percent as the discount rose 12 basis points to
7.46 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 7.82 percent as the
discount rose 12 basis points to 7.31 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8&lsqb; percent, down from 8&rsqb;
percent late Wednesday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 14-32 point. The average yield to
maturity remained unchanged at 7.45 percent.

<HEAD>Markets Hit Again by Mideast, Inflation Concerns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Renewed worries about inflation and the Persian
Gulf squeezed the financial markets Thursday, pushing stocks, bonds
and the dollar lower. Gold and oil prices rose.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 66.83 to
2,681.44, its lowest close since the Mideast crisis began. Stocks
declining in price outnumbered advancing ones by about 4 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks.
   Analysts blamed a worse-than-expected government report on
inflation and disappointing news about the Iraq-U.S. standoff.
   The Dow index dropped about 20 points after the Labor Department
reported that consumer prices rose 0.4 percent, higher than the 0.3
percent most economists expected.
   Meanwhile, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein charged that President
Bush has lied to the American people about the Middle East
situation, and warned there would be American deaths in the region
if the United States continues to intervene.
   Also, President Bush met with Jordan's King Hussein, but
afterward the king said he had not made up his mind about complying
with a United Nations embargo of Iraq. In addition, the king said
he did not carry a letter from the Iraqi leader to Bush, as was
previously reported.
   ``The market was expecting something positive from the
meeting,'' said Yuichi Abe, a vice president in the New York office
of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
   In the credit markets, interest rates rose and prices fell in
nervous trading.
   The Treasury's key 30-year bond fell 1 23-32 points, or $17.19
per $1,000 in face amount. The bond's yield jumped to 8.92 percent
from 8.76 percent late Wednesday. It was the highest yield since it
flirted with 9 percent in early May.
   ``What you're looking at here are straight worries about
inflation,'' said Lincoln Anderson, an economist for Bear Stearns &amp;
Co., a Wall Street investment firm. ``The CPI report was not a good
one.''
   Bond investors generally sell on bad inflation news because
higher prices erode the value of fixed-income investments.
   In the oil market, the September contract for U.S. crude closed
up 90 cents at $27.36 per barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, mostly on disappointment over King Hussein's mission.
   Crude oil's recent rise had stalled earlier in the week on news
that King Hussein would meet with Bush and initiate a peaceful
solution to the Gulf situation.
   The dollar, which seems to have lost some of its allure as a
safe haven, tumbled to an all-time low against the German mark
during U.S. trading. The dollar was quoted at 1.5525 marks in late
New York trading, down from 1.566 marks late Wednesday and from
1.5645 marks Tuesday, the previous low in the modern mark's 42-year
history.
   Gold prices moved in the other direction, rising $6.60 an ounce
to $409.20 on the Commodity Exchange in New York.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Temporarily Limits Judge's Effort</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. appeals court Thursday directed a
federal judge in Cleveland to limit his effort to consolidate
thousands of asbestos liability lawsuits from elsewhere in the
nation.
   A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
heard U.S. District Judge Thomas D. Lambros argue for the right to
consolidate the cases before his court.
   Lambros and nine other district judges from around the country
last Friday issued a blueprint for a national class action designed
to more quickly resolve 90,000 pending thousands of asbestos cases.
The plan ordered consolidation of cases in federal districts in
norther Ohio and east Texas.
   But Thomas Hermann, attorney for Allied Signal Inc. of Morris
Township, N.J., asked the appeals court to prevent Lambros from
proceeding. Hermann said Lambros lacks authority to consolidate
cases from outside his Ohio district.
   Hermann also argued that the 10-judge group lacks authority to
create a mandatory, national class action. Hermann said such
authority only belongs to the U.S. Supreme Court and Congress.
   Allied Signal faces asbestos liability claims because the
company produced brake linings and brake disc pads containing
asbestos. Hermann said the company wants to handle those claims
separately.
   The appeals court did not immediately rule on whether to grant
Allied Signal's request.
   But appelate judge Boyce Martin Jr. directed Lambros to limit
future orders to five plaintiffs who have filed requests with him
to have their asbestos liability complaints certified as class
actions.
   Lambros has issued a series of orders in the last month
mandating creation of the national class-action for asbestos cases.
He also has directed parties from pending cases in Cleveland and
Texas to attend a Sept. 14 hearing in Cleveland to determine
whether Lambros should proceed with certifying the class-action.
   Lambros, in an exchange with Martin, agreed that his orders
should be interpreted only as official notices inviting plaintiffs
to attend the hearing.
   Judge Nathaniel R. Jones said the panel would issue a written
order to define the court's ruling.
   The Federal Judicial Center reports that as of Jan. 1 there were
29,466 cases pending in federal courts in which claims are made for
asbestos-related personal injuries. An estimated 60,000 similar
cases are pending in state court.
   Some companies that made asbestos products are encouraging
consolidation. Eagle-Picher Industries Inc., of Cincinnati, is
urging U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein in New York to
consolidate thousands of cases in his court from companies who say
they can't afford to pay their asbestos claims.
   The plan by the 10 federal judges would give Weinstein control
over a class action for Eagle-Picher and five other struggling
companies.
   Lambros would handle a class action seeking to reach a single
settlement and U.S. District Judge Robert Parker in Beaumont,
Texas, would hold trials for defendants unwilling or unable to
reach settlement agreements.

   A state regulator told the Casino
Control Commission on Thursday that Donald Trump's heavily
leveraged real estate and casino empire is in danger of collapse.
   The commission met here to decide whether to approve a rescue
plan under which Trump would use equity in his three casinos as
collateral for new loans.
   ``Even if these agreements are approved . . . they do not and
will not end the financial difficulties of the Trump
Organization,'' said Thomas Auriemma, deputy attorney general with
the state Division of Gaming Enforcement. ``The organization is in
dire straits.
   ``The possibility of complete financial collapse for the Trump
Organization is not out of the question,'' Auriemma said in his
opening statement.
   Trump, who attended the hearing, was asked about financial
documents released Wednesday showing his assets' market value as
considerably less than his estimates. The documents listed his debt
as $3.2 billion against assets worth between $2.9 billion and $3.5
billion.
   ``I don't know if it's a problem at all,'' Trump said. ``I
really don't know.''
   Chief financial officer Stephen Bollenbach, who was hired to run
the organization on Tuesday, told the commission the organization
could successfully shed its debt.
   ``Clearly, things need to change in this company,'' said
Bollenbach, who formerly worked for the Promus Co. ``I don't think
that means we're in dire straits but certainly somebody else
might.''
   After Trump missed a June 15 bond payment on the Trump Castle
Casino Resort By The Bay, he entered into feverish negotiations
with a group of seven banks. The bankers agreed to an emergency $65
million loan secured by equity in his three casinos.
   Attorney Nicholas Ribis said the agreement with the banks had
been signed and been placed in escrow pending approval of the
commission.
   Though Ribis said the deal needs a quick decision, acting
commission chairwoman Valerie Armstrong said the commission would
not be rushed into ruling on the complex restructuring.
   Ms. Armstrong asked Trump attorney Thomas Cerabino, who helped
with the restructuring agreement, ``If this were approved a week
from now as opposed to in a day or two, would the world come to an
end?''
   ``Quite possibly,'' Cerabino said.
   Final arguments are scheduled for Friday.
   A report submitted by the gaming division cast doubt on the
ability of Trump to meet bond payments due Nov. 15 on the Taj Mahal
Casino Resort and others due Dec. 15 and June 15.
   The report said the cash generated by those properties makes it
unlikely there will be enough money to make those payments. It also
criticized the repeated management shakeups at the three casinos.
   Trump officials testified they have enough time to revamp the
organization before the payments are due, possibly through the sale
of assets.
   Cerabino said the deal would bring order to Trump's complicated
finances and prevents dissatisfied lenders from setting off a chain
of defaults by insisting on payment.
   Under the plan to restructure Trump's roughly $1 billion in
casino debt, banks holding two-thirds of the $65 million loan would
be required to approve any move to declare Trump in default,
Cerabino said. Trump would have 20 days to persuade bankers not to
do that.
   Trump would be in automatic default only if he declared personal
bankruptcy, Cerabino said.
   However several events could trigger consideration of a default,
including a deterioration in the financial health of major Trump
assets, a suspension of Trump's casino license or a legal judgment
of more than $5 million against Trump.
   Trump has been sued by the Pratt Hotel Corp. in an Atlantic City
property Dispute. The lawsuit seeks between $300 million and $700
million in damages. In addition, bondholders of Resorts
International have set aside a $5 million legal fund to pursue
possible action against Trump stemming from his swap of Resorts for
the Taj Mahal.
   The commission rejected a move by contractors owed more than $60
million for work done on the Taj Mahal to participate in the
hearing. Negotiations are continuing on some form of lesser payment
on that debt, said attorney John Daniels.

   Share prices in Tokyo dropped Friday morning as
investors' hopes for an early settlement of the Middle East crisis
faded following U.S.-Jordanian talks.
   The dollar opened unchanged against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 556.45 points, or 2.02
percent, to 26,992.99 within the first 30 minutes of morning
trading.
   Traders said market players dumped stocks as soon as the morning
trading session started because of their growing pessimism over the
Middle East crisis.
   They said many investors lost hopes for an early peace
settlement after Jordan's King Hussein said he was not carrying a
letter from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for President Bush.
   Reports that Hussein was carrying a letter briefly turned around
the market earlier this week, adding over 1,400 points to the
Nikkei index.
   In currency dealings, the dollar started trading at 147.90 yen,
unchanged from Thursday's close.
   The dollar was moving little as investors remained concerned
about the Middle East crisis and the slowdown in the U.S. economy,
said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan
Securities Co.
   After rising in overseas trading, traders sold the dollar
heavily in New York after a fiery speech by Saddam Thursday that
offered little hope for a quick end to the standoff over Kuwait.
   International crisis normally gives the dollar a boost, but the
weak state of the U.S. economy has overwhelmed the currency's
traditional attractiveness as a safe haven.
   In New York, the dollar fell to 147.25 yen from 147.65 yen late
Wednesday.
   Kanai said the dollar was getting weaker against the major
European currencies because of pessimism over the U.S. economy,
whereas the Japanese yen was not rising much ``mainly because of
the falling stock market.''
   On the bond market, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond jumped to 8.120 percent from Thursday's
close at 7.985 percent. The price fell to 82.95 points from 83.53.

<TEXT>
   An investment firm set up by a former partner
in one of the 1980s' top leveraged buyout firms announced its first
acquisition Thursday, a $300 million deal for Alaska's largest food
and drug wholesaler.
   Leonard Green &amp; Partners, a private merchant bank set up to
organize management buyouts, said it agreed to purchase
Anchorage-based Carr-Gottstein Inc. from owners L.J. Carr and B.J.
Gottstein in conjunction with Carr's management.
   ``We have worked closely with Carr-Gottstein's management team
in structuring a transaction that provides for the continued growth
of the company, including new stores and remodeling of existing
stores,'' said Leonard I. Green, who founded LGP late last year in
Los Angeles.
   Details of the buyout's financing were not disclosed, except
that it contained no junk, or high-yield, bonds.
   ``The capital structure is as conservative as is necessary to
put deals together these days,'' said Jon Sokoloff, the LGP partner
credited with putting the deal together.
   Leveraged buyouts, in which the buyer takes on a large amount of
debt to buy a firm, have slowed recently since their most popular
tool for raising money, the junk bond, has fallen into disfavor
with investors.
   Green and two other of LGP's four principals were previously
associated with Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen, a New York merchant
banking firm that specialized in leveraged buyouts, or LBOs.
   Carr's general manager, John Cairns, and vice president of
operations, Mark Williams, will lead the management group. A large
number of managers will become equity holders in the new company,
Sokoloff said.
   Carr-Gottstein operates food and drug stores, the J.B. Gottstein
Co. wholesaling operation, the Oaken Keg liquor stores, a number of
shopping centers in Anchorage, Fairbanks and Eagle River, and
several other distribution-related entities.
   LGP is putting an undisclosed amount of equity into the deal
from its Green Equity Investors limited partnership. That fund
closed last year after raising $224 million from various sources
including several big institutional investors.'' Exact details of
the rest of the senior and subordinated debt financing weren't
announced.

   NEW YORK _ Pan Am ticket agents walked off the job Thursday
evening at four airports, including the carrier's Miami hub, the
airline said.
   Managers were filling in for the workers, who the union said
would return to their posts Friday.
   Besides Miami, agents walked off the job at New York's Kennedy
Airport, Tampa and Orlando. Pan Am spokeswoman Susan Timper said
the carrier's operations in Tampa and Orlando had already shut down
for the night when the workers walked out.
   Workers staged similar one-day job actions May 8 and July 11,
said Joyce Hardy, recording officer for the Teamsters local in
Miami.
   The airline's 5,000 Teamsters members have been working without
a contract since federal mediation failed two years ago. Their
contract expired Feb. 21, 1988.
   Teamsters members include ticket, computer and cargo agents.
   Last month, about 300 union members rallied outside Pan Am
offices in Miami to protest what they called an inadequate contract
offer by the airline. Union members at the time criticized the
company's offer of a 4 percent wage increase. They said they
haven't had a raise since 1979.
   Timper said Thursday night that negotiations are continuing with
the union.

benchmark U.S. crude, closed up 90 cents at $27.36 per barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Crude oil's recent rise had stalled earlier in the week on news
that Jordan's King Hussein would meet with President Bush, which
gave rise to speculation that a peaceful solution to the Persian
Gulf crisis might be in the works.
   But early Thursday, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein gave a tough
speech again attacking U.S. intervention in the region, calling
Bush a liar and reiterating warnings that his country was willing
to battle the multinational force that has bolstered neighboring
Saudi Arabia.
   ``Saddam Hussein generated a lot of fear in the market,'' said
Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc. ``It showed he had a pretty hard-line stance on the
issue.''
   Furthermore, remarks by Bush and King Hussein indicated there
had been little headway in reaching any type of settlement, which
helped boost crude prices further.
   ``People chose to focus on what was going on with the two
presidents calling each other liars,'' said Peter Beutel, a trader
with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. ``It really doesn't bode well
when you have two presidents calling each other liars like two kids
in a sandlot.''
   Hittle predicted oil futures will keep rising ``unless we get
some firm news that Saudi Arabia is going to increase production.''
   Throughout the week, prices have been pushed and pulled by
often-conflicting reports about whether Saudi Arabia and other
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries members would
increase production to compensate for the oil embargo against Iraq.
   Other energy futures traded on the Merc also closed higher on
Thursday.
   Wholesale home heating oil for September delivery rose 2.62
cents to to 75.47 cents per gallon. Unleaded regular gasoline for
September delivery rose 3.41 cents to 87.46 cents per gallon.
   Natural gas futures for September rose to $1.430 per 1,000 cubic
feet from Wednesday's $1.428.

<HEAD>SEC Files Suit Against Imprisoned ZZZZ Best Owner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed
suit Wednesday against imprisoned ZZZZ Best owner Barry Minkow,
claiming he violated securities law in connection with his
now-defunct carpet-cleaning business.
   The federal complaint, stemming from allegedly fraudulent
financial statements filed with the commission in 1986, also names
13 of Minkow's associates.
   Most of them have already agreed to permanent injunctions
barring them from engaging in violations of the securities laws,
said SEC attorney Karen Matteson.
   The complaint alleges that Minkow exaggerated the company's
revenues so he could more easily sell stock in the firm.
   The compliant says he attributed nearly half of ZZZZ Best's $5
million 1986 revenue figure and 86 percent of its 1987 first
quarter revenue figure of $5 million to ``non-existent'' insurance
restoration business, Matteson said.
   Minkow raised $15 million by selling stock in the company,
Matteson said.
   The complaint also alleges that Minkow lied on statements that
showed the company had at least $2 million in assets so it could be
listed by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
Automated Quotation System, the stock exchange known as NASDAQ,
Matteson said.
   ``That listing makes it easier for the public to buy and sell
your stock,'' Matteson said.
   The purpose of filing the complaint is so the SEC can prosecute
on contempt charges, possibly criminal, if the defendants violate
the injunction, Matteson said.
   Minkow's attorney, David Kenner, said he was surprised by the
SEC action.
   ``They're a day late and a dollar short in connection with this
matter for failure for what they should have done a long time
ago,'' Kenner said.
   Minkow, 24, founded the carpet-cleaning company in his parents'
garage when he was 15 years old. He ultimately was charged with 57
counts of securities, credit card and mail fraud in connection with
a scheme to bilk investors and banks of more than $100 million.
   Minkow was convicted last year and is serving 25-year sentence
at a federal prison in Colorado. A federal judge also ordered
Minkow to pay $26 million in restitution.

<HEAD>Settlement Announced In Lawsuit Over Electromagnetic Pulse
Radiation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. has agreed to pay more than
$500,000 to an employee who claimed his leukemia was caused by
exposure to electromagnetic pulse radiation during company tests,
the man's lawyers said Wednesday.
   Robert Strom alleged the aerospace company used him to test the
effects of electromagnetic pulse radiation, a blast of electrical
energy created during a nuclear explosion.
   Strom was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia in 1985,
and he blamed the illness on what he said was chronic exposure to
EMP from 1983 to 1985.
   Under the settlement, Boeing and a co-defendant, Lovelace
Biomedical and Environmental Research Institute, will pay another
$200,000 to support up to 10 years' of medical examinations for
more than 700 other Boeing workers who joined in Strom's
class-action lawsuit, said Strom's attorney, Michael Withey.
   Strom, an electronics technician who worked on EMP tests at
Boeing, also alleged in his suit that Boeing didn't tell him and
other workers of potential health hazards of working with the
radiation, even though it knew there was a potential danger. The
suit later was expanded to include other present and former Boeing
workers.
   Boeing has said it tested the effects of EMP on electronics in
military aircraft and communications equipment. It has denied using
Strom or anyone else as a human research subject.
   Under the settlement, Boeing admitted no liability and none of
the allegations in the lawsuit. Boeing spokesman Russ Young
declined to comment about details of the settlement.
   Medical authorities disagree on whether electromagnetic
radiation can cause cancer or other health problems, and what level
of exposure might pose a risk. Electromagnetic fields are given off
by many electric devices, including power lines, transformers,
video screens and home appliances, but at far lower levels than the
pulses from nuclear explosions.
   The settlement was tentatively approved Wednesday morning by
King County Superior Court Judge Mary Wicks Brucker, Withey said.
Brucker is to hear any objections to the settlement and decide
whether to give it final approval at a Sept. 21 hearing.
